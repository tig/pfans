Subject: Smoke in the cockpit

Can anyone provide a possible cause for smoke coming from the air vents of my
911E with the odor of burning rubber?  I haden't driven the car in about a
month and had just recharged the battery, and drove it for several miles,
noticing a slight burning smell.  Eventually smoke started coming from the
dashboard air vents.  The engine was running normally.  I pulled over and
checked the engine.  A bit of oil dripping on the heat exchangers, but only a
small amount.  None reached the ground.  I'm well aware of what oil on the
exhaust can do, but that doesn't smell like burning rubber.  After about a
half hour, I drove it home.  No smoke during that 5 mile trip.  I'm stumped. 
Any ideas would be appreciated.

                Thanks,
                 Shane

If you're sure it's not the oil or CV grease being cooked and sucked 
in, then I'd suggest the fan or A/C belt.  Check the tension and look 
for a polished appearance.

you, the subscribers, while making it MUCH easier to maintain. To that end,
a survey has been mailed out. PLEASE fill it in and return it to the

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop

Subject: tranny oil in 356

In a 62 356B coupe I bought not long ago I just discovered
a pool of transmission oil (characteristic smell identifies it)
under the inspection port in the tunnel by the rear "seats".  It
is pooled up on either side at the very rear of the tunnel.
Can someone tell me how it gets there.... where the leak is?
(About a month ago when I had the car on jackstands to do the brakes I
checked the level through the normal port on the side of the transmission
and added about a pint to bring it up to the level of the threads ..I have
always just pumped it in until it just starts to overflow and never had
any problem)

Subject: wheels/tires, body color code

I just had my car serviced for the oil leaks.  My mechanic steamed the
engine, then found that oil leaks were coming from the push rod seals, oil
cooler, front timing cover gaskets and seals.  He replaced an overflow
hose, a cam hose, fuel pump which was leaking, and some heater hoses,
along with oil and filter change.  This came to $637, of which $217 was
labor, $365 parts.

My mechanic thinks the '77 911S will run for awhile, but recommends I
start saving for pulling the engine and resealing the rear engine, push
rod seals, oil cooler, new front timing cover, gaskets and seals, adjust
vales, replace gaskets, and also consider new piston liner w/ sleeves, and
new fuel lines, which he says are getting old, and hard to replace, as
they go through the body of the car.

Sometime down the road, I'd also like to get a set of wheels/tires that
don't rub.  My current setup is gold BBS mags, 7Jx16H2 KBA 224 B123 0.1 GG
on the rear with Ohtsu HS501 205/50 R16 86V tires.  The rear is where they
rub if heavy load and going over a big bump.

The fronts are 7Jx15 BBS gold mags, KBA 40196 0.1GG 290.0876 with
Bridgestone Potenza re71 205/60R15 90H tires.  

Does anyone know how much these mags cost, and if there might be a set of
tires I can put on the rear that would scrape less, but keep the same
profile, as the car is pretty level right now?

Subject: 356 tire question

OK, this is a little off the usually well-beaten tire path...

The car in question is a '64 356 SC, decambered, no camber compensator
and with fresh 23mm rear torsion bars. Stock 15mm front sway bar, fresh
bushings, fresh king and link pins. It has the original 4.5" wheels
all the way around.

It's driven hard with great frequency, will be autocrossed a little and
if I'm brave I may even push it around a track or three -- "just lapping"
instead of my usual 12/10ths style when in a prepared car 8{P

I need tires. The previous owner proved to my satisfaction (and annoyance
and expense) that modern sticky rubber, especially squarish tires with
stiff sidewalls like A008s, just doesn't work on these cars. At least in
street trim (since I've seen EP and Vintage Racers do otherwise). Logic 
indicates that I'd be better off with a modern tire similar in construction 
to the venerable and deeply missed CN-36 or Radial X.

So: what modern tires have relatively stiff tread and semi-flexible
sidewalls, have good but not spectacular dry traction and equally good
wet? Oh, and it would help if they weren't Pirelli or Michelin since 
I've had out-of-round problems with Pirellis and sidewall failure with
Michelins...

Or, failing that, what do you run on *YOUR* 356?? There are at least 20
other 356 owners on the list, someone should have an answer...

Dear Porschephiles, 
			Happy New Year !


	In 1988, with the Turbo S, one of the modifications to increase HP of 
the 2.5 l engine was an improved turbo. Hence my questions:

	1. Can this newer turbo be retrofitted to earlier models (1987)?
	2. If so, is this a bolt in procedure or are major modifications needed?
	3. Any advice on replacing the turbocharger on top of what the factory 
	   manual has ?
	4. Has anyone experience with a Garretson turbocharger for this 
	   application ?

Thanks, Bart.

Hi folks,

I'm looking into buying a 924 (thanks, Ross Stites, for your help with this.)
Since I'm a student on a limited budget, I need to know whether maintenance
on this model is financially realistic.  Specifically,

*  The engine/powertrain are VW/Audi.  Would VW/Audi mechanics work on
   the 924 engine?

*  The rest of the car is Porsche.  With a good shop manual, is it realistic
   to expect that a novice mechanic could maintain the car?  i.e.  Can I
   get away with avoiding Porsche labor charges?

*  In general, how is the 924's reliability record?

And one cosmetic question... Did any 924's come with the 944-style rubber
tail spoiler?

Thanks,

	Our '88 and '89 911's have the radio antenna-in-the-windshield
	"feature".  Reception is horrible, of course.  The '84 I had with the
	factory telescoping antenna was far better.  I have asked various
	specialty shops about alternatives, short of drilling and installing
	a mechanical one, and the advice has been "there is no alternative
	that's any good".  A few claimed some of the blame is the factory
	radio, but a very good after-market stereo in the '89 hasn't made
	any real difference.
	
	Has anyone had any success in getting better reception without
	resorting to drilling?  If the best solution is a normal antenna,
	any advice on brands?  Caveats on installation of a factory-like
	antenna (location, avoiding rust, seals, etc.)?  I can't bear the

	You do need to remove the poly-whatever bushings from their carriers
	to smear the goop in their bore, that is, at the bushing/roll bar
	interface.
	
	One trick is to install a Zerk fitting into the bushing carrier, and
	drill a hole through the bushing to its bore.  You can then lube it

Subject: 911 gearbox dimantling

Hi,

I'm forwarding this message pfrom my friend who's not connected
to the net:
- ---------------------

Help,

I am about to service my 4-speed 915 gearbox and fit new syncro-rings.
In my manuals everything is referred to the 5-speed 915 gbox, so when
dismantling the nuts from the pinion and input shaft you are supposed
to lock the gearbox by selecting 5th gear and 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th at
the same time. For the 4-speed g-box they only say that dismantling
is the same as for the 5-speed with exception of the 5th gear. And that's
my problem. How do I lock my 4-speed so I can remove the pinion and
input shaft nuts.

Other useful information is also appreciated.

Thanks
Bjorn Larsson

They certainly could, if they had the inclination.  Anyone who knows

Yes!  You can do quite a bit of work yourself.  How mechanically 
inclined are you?  How good and diverse is your toolbox?  What 
condition will your new car be in when you get it?

> *  In general, how is the 924's reliability record?
It's fair, except for the 931's (924 Turbos).  An older model will have 
brittle hoses that might need replacing (water, vacuum, vapor, etc.).  
You may have a water pump failure, and valve seal & guide wear.  Check 
compression & oil consumption carefully to get an idea of the engine's 
internal condition.  The car may also have little trim problems, like 
old stuff falling off.

> And one cosmetic question... Did any 924's come with the 944-style rubber
> tail spoiler?
The original 924 Turbo had a little rear spoiler.  The '87/'88 924S 
(944 engine) also had a little spoiler.  Regular, original ('76-'82) 
924's did not have a spoiler.  You can retrofit a spoiler easily, since 
the hatch glass has not changed to this day.  They just glue on.

Good luck in your purchase,

You can go to 225/50 fronts and 245/45 rears with no trouble.  In fact, 
this is an extremely common upgrade for your car!  Original 
circumference is maintained with these sizes.

Advantages: more stick, nice look, ability to handle rear power better 
(original rear turbo tires are a bit small for 217+ HP.)
Disadvantages: more "tram-lining", or directional instability on bad 
(cupped or worn) roads, more debris thrown up on you fender lips 
(blasts through the paint).

I'll let other netters address brand recommendations - it's a big 
subject that depends a lot on your driving style & interests, weather 
needs, and budget.  I think most of us here would prefer dry 
performance tires (Goodrich, Goodyear, Yokohama, Bridgestone).

Subject: Indexing Plugs

This weekend I received my set of Jacobs washers for
indexing the spark plugs on my Porsche 924S.  I had been
told by others that indexing the plugs meant aiming the
opening in the spark plug gap at the intake manifold (intake
valve).  However, the instructions that came with the
washers stated I should aim the gap "in the direction of
maximum entrance turbulence...  Entrance turbulence is
primarily set up by squish, which is that puff(flow) of
air/fuel just as the piston reaches TDC and squishes the air
out between its own top and the flat part of the cylinder
head."  In other words, the direction of the gap should be
set based on the design of the top of the cylinder head
rather than the location of the intake valve.

Since I do not have a cross-section view of the cylinder
head, I had no way to decide which way to aim the gap.
Further, I wasn't sure if I should follow the directions
from Jacob's, or aim the gap at the intake valve, as I had
been instructed by others.

I would like the input of others who have indexed their
spark plugs.  How did you decide on the direction for the
spark plug gap?  Did you do pre- and post-testing to verify
an improvement in the performance of your car?  Which of the
two approaches is the more "correct"?

Subject: RE:  cam belt tensioner for 951


Concerning the benefits of having the mechanical belt tensioner I would
like to add the following:

As some other people mentioned in some related postings, the mechanical
belt tensioner does not adjust the tension of the cam belt in a dynamic way
(i.e., once you set it that's it). If for some reason the belt expands or
shrinks, its tension will not be automatically readjusted.
The belt has to be retensioned every 10k miles. The benefit is that for
retension you do not need the expensive belt tensioner tool. The only thing you
need to do is to loosen and tighten two bolts (actually a bolt and a nut). 
A lot of mechanics and tool suppliers that I talk to, insist that the
belt tensioning tool is necessary for the cam belt. I completely disagree
with their views. After reading the manuals and playing with the
mechanical rensioner, I believe that if the tool is needed for the proper
tensioner of the cam belt, the mechanical tensioner is completely useless.

The benefits of the mechanical tensioner are:
1. Easy cam belt retensioning every 10K miles
2. You do not have to buy the belt tensioner tool, if you do not care that
   much about the precise tension of the balance shaft belt. This not the
   recommended procedure, but I personaly do not think that cost/benefits
   ratio of tensioner tool can be justified for cars with the mechanical
   belt tensioner. The way I adjusted the tension of the balance shaft belt is:
   - Prior to removal of the balance shaft belt, I hung some weights until
     the belt touched the upper roller guide.  After installation of the new
     belt, I adjusted the tensioner nut such that when the same weight is
     hung form the same spot, the belt touches the roller guide (this of course
     assumes that the tension of the belt was correct which is not a valid
     assumption). If retensioning has been done recently in a dealer, you can 
     assume that you are measuring the right tension. Although, I did mine this
     way and everything works fine so far, I would not recommend this procedure.

Coming back to the original question concerning the benefits of installing 
mechanical belt tensioners to pre-87 models, it depends on how easy you 
can do the this installation. There are definitely benefits of this tensioner,
but the fact that you will probably have to drill holes in the engine and 
install a rather powerful spring make me believe that probably it does not 
worth the effort.

Hi gang,

I've own my 928 for 6 years now.  Since then I've replaced two diode in my

What I'm asking is, is this a common problem?  Is there a way to prevent

Yes, but you'll get more lag and hassle in your around-town driving, in

I haven't done the job, but so long as the input & output stud / hole 
spacings are the same as the smaller turbo, you'll have no problem.  If 
they are different, you'll have to get a new exhaust flange made up and 
installed (not easy) or use an adapter plate.  My *guess* is that's 
it's a bolt-in job.

Don't do it.  You'll lose overall drivability in exchange for more 
boost.  BUT, the stock smaller turbo has enough boost to get you up to 
about 275+ HP anyway, and will blow your head gasket rather easily 
given a season of track driving (I've blown 2, thank you!).  I've 
driven both and truly hate the larger turbo's lag on the street.  For 
track driving, with all-out performance in mind, I'd say "do it".

Hope this helps,

Cam hose?

911 push rod seals? 
      Oil return tubes.

Front timing cover? 
      I forget this one, but it's where the chain tensioners live.
      Yes, I know it's at the back of the engine.

Piston liners?
      Cyilnder.

leaky fuel pump?
      Hey, a hit!  I don't see why the fuel pump couldn't leak!
      Of couse, tightening the fuel line could cure it!

However, Reid's right:
      Find a different mechanic.  This one doesn't even know the 
      correct terms.  Bad sign.  It probably means he hasn't even 
      ordered parts very often, which means he probably has little

      You do *not* want someone else using your car as a learning

      An inpet mechanic is even more expensive than the dealer.

My experience is with an '89 944Turbo w/ 8x16F and 9x16R wheels. I use
245/45x16 tires all around. You can go to larger tires on your existing 
rims,
eg 225/50 on the front and 245/45 on the rear.
For the track I've had the best experience wth BFGoodrich R1s, but 
Yokahama 008Rs last longer.
Other than cost (and grumbling from the guy who has to mount these wide,
stiff walled tires) I see no disadvantage. On the street the wider profile 
looks
better and on the track or on ramp the wider tire patch would improve both
braking and cornering potential.

P-netters,
        Well, I spent the week of Christmas dismantling my 2.2l
engine.  Although the engine had been sitting for ten years when
I purchased the car, it came apart rather nicely and appears to be
in pretty good shape.  Now for the two big problems.
        One piston had a broken skirt (I found the piece in the case)
and I am unable to remove one cylinder that is stuck to a piston.
Any hints.  I tried heating both the cylinder and piston and then some 
gentle tapping with a wooden mallet.  I am at the point of really
going at it hard, but wanted to check if there were any miracle
chemicals that would free them.
        Does anyone know if the skirt can be welded back on the piston
or is this a lost cause (new piston time)?
Thanks

Subject: Bloody Linguistics



I am amazed at the number of responses generated by my most recent
posting about linguistics, and I am heartened that admidst the barrage
a grand total of TWO got the point.

I was, as you can well imagine, incensed and outraged at the thought
that I had been led astray by a person holding so noble and
trustworthy a position as fruit department manager.  Could it be that
tangerine and blood orange ARE in fact TWO DIFFERENT FRUITS, despite
the assurance of the local Troy experts?

Armed with various email messages assuring me (with various levels of
diminuation) that a blood orange is not a tangerine, I raced to the
supermarket to confront Mr. Smarty-Pants Fruit Manager.  Assuming the
character of most of the email messages I received, I screamed and
yelled, gesticulated, grimaced, flatulated, and otherwise made a
spectacle of myself as I attempted to make my point.  I then
apologized profusely to the poor guy (he *did* look a lot like the
fruit manager), who will probably never buy lemons again, and the store
management arrived *en-mass*.  Having misdirected most of my energy at
this point, I was less of a spectacle as I repeated - in a
nevertheless highly accusatory manner - the story of my betrayal.  

The fruit manager was apologetic.  "I had no idea you would take my
comments so *seriously*," he said, visibly shaken by my intensity.

"This is the god-damned *NET* for chrissake!"  I yelled, pointing to
the email printouts.  "Of COURSE it gets taken seriously!"

The store manager broke in, his soothing voice and manner distracted
me from the fact that I was being escorted out. "Sir, if you will just
calm down.  We are under direct orders not to reveal the existence of
blood oranges to the American Public.  I'm afraid we can not discuss
the matter further."

"Direct orders from whom?" I asked, stunned.

The manager smiled as the doors closed.  I was outside.  Alone.  I
drove back home slowly, running the implications of what I had just
heard over and over in my head.  A feeling of paranoia came over me as
I arrived at my house.  Once inside, I realized I had only one hope
for ever discovering the truth, and I made the call.  

"Hello, can I speak to <insert stinger> OLIVER STONE, please?"

"Speaking."

I explained my story and was treated with silence in response.  After
a very long pause (I knew he was still on the line since I could hear
"Wild Palms" playing in the background), he said, "Jesus."

"What should I do?"

"This sounds serious.  I want you to go to Washington, check out the
congressional archives.  Find out all you can about these oranges.  I
will check with some contacts I have in the fruit industry.  Call me
from Washington on my cellular phone when you have anything."  He
paused.  "And Chris?"

"Yes?"

"Don't mention this to ANYone.  Especially not the virtual reality
world."

"The virtual reality whaaaaaa?  Oh you mean...aha....riiiiight.  Mum's
the word."

I proceeded to Washington and began my research.  The congressional
archives held a paper trail dating back to 1963, where it ended in
several references to the results of a federal commission.  The
documents were coded "docket 901".  I went to the archivist and
requested it.

The archivist punched something into the computer, then looked at me.
"Those documents are sealed in a federal vault and are not to be
opened until the year 2063."

"Sealed?  Vault?"  My momentary confusion was broken by the sounds of
footsteps.  The kind of sounds of footsteps that can only be generated
by men wearing suits and dark glasses inside.  I lept through nearby
window.  Thankfully bullshit is abundant in Washington.  Even more
thankfully, this pile was covered.  I landed softly and odorlessly.  

Now a fugitive, I found a nearby payphone and called Oliver's cellular
number.  His voiced sounded emotionally strained.

"Chris.  You and I are going to Chile.  Meet me at Joe Rabi Airport in
Miami at 5."

The plane trip was long, and Oliver would not reveal the specifics of our
destination.  I attempted to make him feel better by mentioning that
"Wild Palms" was technically feasable, but largely misunderstood.  I
think I used the word "imagery" over a thousand times.  He cheered up
a little, but still seemed disturbed.  He assured me I would
understand soon enough, but didn't want to get me so depressed that I
wouldn't appreciate the in-flight movie, "Platoon".  

After arriving in Santiago and meeting in alleys with various people
of questionable ethical and hygenic origins, we were taken on a car
ride with a very frightened guide.  After travelling for two hours
into the heart of the fruit producing region, our guide stopped and
explained how we must walk the final 10 miles to assure we were not
observed.  Oliver had brought jungle camoflage and other survival
implements, and we proceeded in the direction indicated.  We knew we
were close when we saw a sign, "Blood Orange Production" on a building
hidden within the jungle.  Only a single dirt road led to the
building, and trucks packed with crates of what seemed to be oranges
were just leaving the loading docks on one side of the building.
Posing as workers who were just wearing camoflage as a fashion
statement, we slipped inside the building to be met with a sight so
horrible it will stay in my minds eye forever: two early model 911s
lay rusting on the floor of the warehouse.  Wheels removed,
windshields cracked - and most appalling of all, Water-cooled V8
detroit-made engines in the back.  I began to retch and Oliver had to
carry me into the main room of the wharehouse. 

Here I regained my composure and discovered the source of Oliver's
emotional stress.  We were looking at the manufacturing process for
blood oranges - yes, I said *manufacturing* process.  Blood Oranges
are not grown, they are *made*.  They start out as normal oranges, and
roll along a conveyor belt to a point where they are doused with a red
liguid.  I followed the hoses that fed the mechanical sprayer to the
ceiling, where I was dismayed to discover three PEOPLE, throats slit
in "columbian necktie" fashion, their blood draining into a small
trough that fed the machine.  It was my turn to carry a retching Oliver
Stone.

We made it back to our car.  During the ride back, I expressed my
desire to reveal the truth to the world.  

"There are a lot of loose ends in this story," he said.  "For example,
what does this have to do with the US GOvernment, why are they
covering this up?"

"You don't get it, Oliver," I said.  "I now have evidence that even
further proves my point that there is something lost in translation
from the German word `blutorange' to the American, `tangerine'."

He though for a moment, and said, "But they are different fruits."

I sighed, then laughed.   After all, no one understood "Wild Palms" either.

An additional note on the use of grease to prolong the life of

Using petroleum jelly for this purpose is a bit of "laboratory lore"
dating from the days before corrosive chemicals were used to bleach
Vaseline (tm).  In these "modern" times you should definitely avoid
using petroleum jelly on sensitive electrical contacts.

Sounds like a problem with too much body roll...

I have a friend with a Bug that uses a 19mm sway bar in front and has great
luck with Yoko AVS Intermediates in front and A008s in the rear...he claims
to have almost no body roll.

I don't know if this translates directly to the 356, but typically stiff
sidewall tires don't do their job if there is too much "body roll induced
adverse camber change" to coin a phrase.  The point being that since the
camber change in a turn is close to the body roll angle in the 356 (due to
trailing arm front end -- not so with Struts, et al.), you have two choices:
dial in lots of negative camber to compensate or get a bigger swaybar.

Another option if you don't want to change the suspension is the Yoko A509
which is exactly the tire you described above.
I thoroughly enjoyed them on my not-quite-stock Honda Civic Si.  Again, I
don't know if this applies to a 356...

Good Luck!

Subject: 951:pre vs. post 1988 Turbo (Denys)

Upgrading turbochargers on pre '88 Turbo S 951s would be a big job. 
Switching to the KKK K-26 turbo used on the 247hp motors would not be bolt 
in. Additionally, you'd have to change the wastegate and the DME and KLR 
control boxes (or at least the chips in them).  It's also possible that 
some other stuff, like the cycling valve, is different.  
	You can pretty much get the horsepower by replacing the DME and KLR 
chips along with the restricted banjo bolt as supplied by Autothority. 
That's only a 2 hour job.
	I have one friend that's had a 951 motor built using a larger 
Garretson. The car hasn't run yet so I can't tell you the final result.  
The dyno figures were most impressive however.  It's a big bux job to do 
this though. The whole air inlet flow was moved to the opposite side of the 
car, a bigger intercooler was squeezed in, custom chips were developed, a 
bigger diameter exhaust system was put in, etc.,etc.
	If you do this you'll definitely be pioneering, so let us know what 
you do.

Check your local labor rates.  It may not be worth considering.

In NJ, VWs were $52/hr two years ago, which makes a ~$65 Porsche rate not
look that bad by comparison.  Audi is currently $58, I think.

One of the interesting things about the 356 is that it breaks everything
you know about how to tune suspensions because, well, you are typically
used to tuning modern suspensions. Remember: double trailing arm with
king and link pins for the front, and rear swing-axles. Under cornering and
braking, you get a camber jacking effect that you really can't do anything
about. Before someone else jumps in here, oh sure, you can use camber 
compensators, Z-bars, and de-camber the rear suspension, but you *CAN'T*
get around the basic geometry, which fundamentally sucks relative to almost
anything else on the road today.

Anyway, some of the Bug stuff works, but most doesn't. At least, the late
model IRS stuff...

>Another option if you don't want to change the suspension is the Yoko A509

Ah. I'd considered the 509s, and the AVS U+4 (I use AVS Intermediates on

  Wait a minute...silicon grease for electronic use is WHITE and has a mix
of compounds to enhance its thermal transfer (not its lubricity).  It's

  Real ordinary silicon grease is clear.  In these parts we call it Rod 'n

I have a 356B Cabriolet with A008R's and I would run anything else for dry
conditions.  I don't undrstand your comments about the 008's not working on
356s??  Granted this type of tire technology is way beyond the performance
band (and structural load capability) of the old 356, I have had nothing but
good experiences in DRY conditions.  The car is set up with:

* 5.5" aftermarket wheels
* -.5 deg of camber on the front (i.e., decambered C-links)
* 19 mm sway bar (front)
* -.5 deg of camber on the rear (adjustable spring plates)
* rear camber regulator ( not the factory camber compensator)
* Koni$ front and rear soft setting

I have run the car at Sears Point for fun and it is a blast to drive. The
car is restored to it's original condition (Smyrna green paint, tan top, etc)
except for the above mods.  The engine and tranny are the original and have
also been rebuilt (it was delivered as an "s" spec'd car: 75 hp).  The car
has not been driven in the wet so I can't vouch for the A008R's wet, but I
have driven a 356B coupe with A008s (more tread) in the wet and it was a
little squirrelly.  Yoko made a very good tire (for the money and performance) 
the 352 but they have since discontinued it.  Speaking of discontinuing, the
A008 are getting very hard to find in 185/70 15 so they might not be a option
for you anyway.  Also Excellence had an article/technical note on tire sizes
for the 356 maybe two issues back!?

There was a new voltage regulator introduced in 1983, and this is
covered in tech bulletin book A, group 27, number 83-01.  There were
apparently problems with the older regulator due to engine heat.
Unclear from the bulletin whether the part is useable on cars other
than MY82 and 83.

In either case, sounds like you have a bad voltage regulator.  Check

The only thing I would add to this discussion is that when you put a
245 tire on an eight inch rim, the sidewalls are not as vertical as
they would be with a 225.  You end up, unless I am mistaken, with a
little more sidewall flex in return for more rubber on the ground.

I too use 245/45x16 on 8" and 225/50x16 on 7" rims.  Works fine.

Subject: Replacing Struts 86' 951

I am going to attempt the job of replacing the struts on my 86 951. I have been
experiencing severe (intermitent) steering wheel shimmy. Comes and goes when I
change lanes and at speeds of 50+ MPH. As a result of getting my questions
answered by all you helpful folks, It has been determined that the problem
exists with the strut and it's associated components not the wheels as
previously thought,local mechanics also agree.There is play in the upper strut
area when the wheel is pulled out at the bottom and pushed in at the top,or vice
versa.There is also a bit of play in the strut itself, where the shaft enters
the strut.A mechcanic was presented with the intermitent wheel shimmy problem,
he checked for play in the wheel as described earlier and quickly stated that I
needed upper strut bearings? (Just a note:the wheel bearings were replaced and
repacked just recently) Not any play in this area.I seem to have a problem that
he does not also reccomend that the struts be replaced, afer all the car has 87k
miles on it with it's original struts. Another mechanic who has experience in
racing said that I should also replace the strut as well. Once the strut is
removed I would like to replace all the other related parts that also may be
worn or damaged. Can someone help me with the parts that commonly wear out, thus
in turn causing this problem.( I have a parts fich so part #'s and or
descriptions would be very helpful. Which struts should I get for road use?

I would like to attempt this job with a friend, is it very difficult? Do I need
any special tools? What are the strut prices? And where is the best place to buy
them? I do realize that a wheel alignment must be performed following this
procedure.

If it helps, I have the 944 and 944 turbo workshop manuals and also the haynes
book.(Seems that alot of info is covered in the 924 manuals.)
which I do not have, will this be a problem?

What is the procedure? Any tricks or hints?

hi gang,

	hope everyone had a great holiday. i spent this morning pulling
the water pump from my 928. everything went great until i got right to
the water pump itself. i can now answer the question: "does the harmonic
balancer have to come off to remove the water pump?" the answer is 'no',
if you're clever with a wrench. two of the water pump bolts are a bit
tough to got to, but it can be done.

	item one: one of the bolts snapped off as i was trying to unscrew
it. i was trying to work it back and forth and be real careful, and it
snapped anyway. arrgh! guess its time for an easy out and drill bit.

	item two: how do i get the idler wheel off of the water pump
housing? i took the tensioner arm off, and i've pried at the roller
that's still on the water pump housing a bit, but i'm afraid to just
wail on it, in case i don't understand something here. any suggestions?
maybe i need a gear puller?

	thanks for everyone for the suggestions on the water pump
and rebuilding. since i've had good luck with Zim's Autotechnic recently,
i decided i'd give them a shot, since they provide a rebuild with 12month
warranty for $105. it should be here friday, we'll see.

I guess a ring or two is welded to the cylinder wall.  Try soaking with

not sure how you would restore/re-hone the cylinder wall after freeing
it up, though.

>Does anyone know if the skirt can be welded back on the piston

Welded?  Dream on.  Depending on how much of the skirt is gone, it may
not be a problem.  We often remove some of the skirt to either give a
connecting rod clearance or to windage the case.  These are smallish
bites which I grind out of the skirt, perhaps a centimeter or so high,
perhaps twice as wide.  If you've lost some non-structural bit, I'd only
worry about *why* you lost it.

forgotten...

Having done this, you should be able to drop the strut enough to pull the
shock bearing off.  The good news is that if this is all you do, you
will not have to realign the front.  Btw, the M14 lock nut tends to have
a limit to its reuse.  You can remove then retorque it a couple of times,
but after that it tends to not lock very well and can back out.  Suggest
you mark it with paint if in doubt.  They're cheap.

With regard to play in the shock piston, this is also pretty common in
944's and 911's, and nothing to get too excited about.  Some people will
diagnose it as a bad wheel bearing.  But if you notice play, then
put one hand on the shock as you wiggle the wheel with the other, it
becomes clear that it's play in the shock and not the wheel bearing.

As long as the play isn't too great, and the shock hasn't blown fluid,
I'd live with it.  One of mine has been this way for about a year.

Hi, Stan.
 
I have 195/60 x 15 Bridgestone RE71 on my 356 SC, and I love them. I have
gone through two sets already, in two years of daily driving and slaloms,
and will continue to buy them as long as I can get them. I wish I could find
the RE71R in that size.
 
For comparison, I also have a one-owner (I'm #2) 356 C, which I kept as
original as possible by putting 165 SR 15 Continentals on it. The difference
is like day and night. The SC is stable at high speeds (up to 110 on
freeway) and in crosswinds; the C wanders all over the place, just like all
the road tests said it did way back when.
 
The SC also has decambered front (by machining the links, like George Bono
says), stock front anti-roll bar, 5.5 in. wheels, absolutely stock rear end.
The jacking in corners used to be a problem until I learned to set the Konis
full hard at the back for slaloms, then reset them to half-hard for the
road. This only takes 5 minutes. I keep the fronts half hard. Setting the
rears hard may not help in a long race track sweeper, but we run
slaloms up to 80 mph and full-hard delays the jacking long enough to get
through anything the organizers can think of. Once I forgot to set them and
the car felt like it had greasy rear tires. The SC has never been beaten by
another 356 in slaloms, my co-driver and I finished 1-2 in the 1992 Zone 8
slalom series in class, and we would have won in 93 but missed a few events
and the guy who finishes 3 or 4 or 5 behind us did every event. We regularly
beat some of the 911s, and I think all of the stock 924s and 928s but I'd
have to check the results to be sure.
 
BTW, have you seen the 356 book, "Porsche 356 -- driving in its purest form"
by Dirk-Michael Conradt? Motorbooks and some of the book retailers have it,
and so does the publisher, Brett Johnson. (Ads in Pano, Excellence, etc.) I
ask because I'm curious to how it's being received by the 356 people. I did
the translation from German to English.

Subject: '70T for sale

Thru some of my normal looking around I came across a 1970 911T for
sale that I thought is worth passing on.  The car has new red paint
(not sure if it's original color)  and looks like much of the
weatherstrip etc was replaced during repaint.  The car has a new
or excellent black interior, nice alloy's and new or newer tires.
The odometer shows 33K which the seller (a local higher end park
and sell place) claims is supposed to be original, but the odo is
broken and the mileage not documented.  The car is from a collection
in Oregon (his story) and is supposed to be mechanically sound though
admittedly in need of a tune-up.  It's a coupe, btw.  Here's the clincher-
asking about the car 2X gave prices of $5K and $5.5K, so it  seems a
little negotiable.

Maybe it's just because I have over twice that amount in my '70T which
would need a repaint to be cosmetically as nice as this one, but I
found that to be a great price, to the extent that I considered the
car and was going to sell mine (which IMHO I *thought* should be worth
about $8K as it has a sunroof).

One small puddle of oil under the car.  It's supposed to run good, and
they have no problem with a mechanic coming onsite to check out the car
WHICH I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

It's at Nostalgia Motors in Cambell CA (Northern CA near San Jose and
close to San Francisco).  The number I have is (408) 370-7355.  Nostalgia
has probably 60 cars for sale indoors in kind of a '50-60's deco theme.
I like to go there and look around every few months.  I find their prices
to typically be high, and many (most?) of the cars are on consignment.  I
have nothing to do with these folks and would exercise caution when
consdiereing a purchase.  This car was just so clean and so inexpensive
(my opinion) that I thought I'd pass it on.  My local Porsche mechanic
at Pacific Coast Porsche was willing to go check the car out on-site if
I was really interested.

Happy shopping-
Mark

Pete,

Thanks for the tip on defeating the upshift light.  I pulled the
green wire and--volia--no light.  You have no idea how happy I am.

For other mid-80's Carrera owners who desire to do the same, here's
what I did:

1. Remove the steering wheel.  You can probably do it without, but
it's easy without the wheel in the way.

2. Pop the tach out of the dash.  I did this by going in thru'
the front compartment & pushing on the tach with my hand.  You can
pry from the dash, but why take a chance of marring the cover?

3. Remove the speed sensor block from the rear of the tach.  It's
the unit of six wires towards the bottom of the tach.  Use a small
screwdriver to release the green wire.  Tape it.  Replace the block.
The green taped wire fits nicely into the corner of tach receptacle.

4. Stick the tach back in & replace the steering wheel.

Last night I looked up the schematics for the 86 carrera upshift

Anyway, there ar 14 wires on the back of the tachometer, 8 are related to
lights, like turn signals, high beam and instrument lites and 6 connect
to a square in the tachometer with an electronics symbol on it labeled upshift
indicator.  Of those 6, 2 go to ground (brown and the black/red), one goes
to power (gray), 2 go to the DME box (black and black violet) and one goes
to the speedometer(green).
 
At one time in the past, my "speed transmitter" coil in the transaxle went
bad.  I therefore had no speedometer, no cruise control and no upshift light!
The green wire that goes to the speedometer is also the wire to the "speed
transmitter" and the cruise control.
 
According to the schematic, the wire comes from the "transmitter" and goes
to th e speedo (green), where it connects to 2 other wires, the green wire
to the upshift indicator and a black/brown wire that goes to the cruise
control.

So, it would seem, that you could remove the green wire from the back of
the tachometer and not interrupt the pulses from the "speed transmitter" to
the speedometer and cruise control, but not have them reach the upshift
indicator.

I had mentioned my friend's Bug -- he has a '60 -- i.e. King Pin front end
and swing axle rear.  I am sure he has decambered the rear somewhat, but runs
without a camber compensator.  He has also lowered the car somewhat and runs
much smaller than stock diameter tires (185-60-14 Fr & 205-60-13 Rr).  With a
decent engine, he can regularly embarrass "fast" cars at slaloms.  Not much for

Ron,

I don't have a fiche in front of me.  If you're talking about the spring
plate rubber bushing, it is available for pre-'68 cars as a separate
part, 644.333.131.00, according to an old Stoddard catalogue I have
lying around.  The later cars have the rubber bushings bonded to the
spring plates.  Buying the whole spring plate is not that expensive,
check it out.

Installing the plastic bushings is a major PITA mostly because of
tolerance (lack of) in their manufacture.  When we last put a set in the
race car, of the two new ones one popped right in, the other was just
enough larger to give me major grief.

I think that with everything disassembled, you can pass a threaded rod
through the torsion bar tube spanning its entire width.  My plan of record
was that, next time I had to do this task, I will buy a
length of threaded rod, make up a pressing plate for each end, and
completing the contraption with a couple of nuts, use it to press the
plastic bushings into the tube.

On a car your age, there is probably some corrosion in the tube where
the bushings go.  Clean it out.  I took a chisel to a couple of blooms,
cleaned the rest out with a wire wheel (I think), and ended up with
good metal, this on a '74 chassis.

For those of you with cracked dashes, especially the ones that own

I have been collecting information and have found three companies that
do this work in the USA.  I found other companies that sell 911 and
other European car dashes and do repairs.  These companies can restore
the 924 style dash.  They don't care about the condition of the dash.
They rebuild it from scratch, using some sort of vacuum forming
process.  The price range is from $335 to $430 for the 924 and takes 2
to 3 weeks I was told.  This compares to about $200 in Australia per
Kelvin Ross, who started me on this research project.  I really hate
the Dash-Topper / Coverlay fix.  Of course, you have to remove the dash
and live without the car for a couple of weeks...  Removing the dash is
the easy part.  Living without the car is something you learn to do
when you own a 931.  I forgot, you might have to justify the expense to

Subject: 914 piston/cylinder specifics, 2.0 liter four.
  {this is ~5K long}
  Dearest Net Folk of Porsche Persuasion:
    
  This is a fragment of a story that began with 'buying a 914' i posted
back in early November of '93.  The subject car is a 1976 914 2.0l.

  I had the dubious pleasure of cracking open my 2.0l 4 'GC' powerplant
over the '93 holidays.  I had to do something to the motor because it was
really sick, so i yanked it out one nite and ripped the head off number 3
and 4 bank.  Lo and behold boucoup rust stains on lower portion of #3 jug.
  This cylinder could only produce 55 psi.  i did no leakdown (no tool yet).
  Removal of the jug revealed a broken top compression ring, a broken chunk
out of the oil ring land (bottom of piston), and last but certainly not least
a cracked piston from pin clip to clip across the wrist pin boss.
  Nice to know i was riding around in a GRENADE!...

  The P/C set seems to be of non-Mahle origin (how does one identify NPR?)
the pistons are of VERY deep dish, with a pair of oil scavenge slots that
appear to seriously weaken the piston skirt between the pin boss's.
[in comparison to the Mahle hardware]

  Anyway, the damage seems to have been initiated by water in the cylinder
(i know! air cooled) from some numbnuts leaving his busted 914 in the rain
with the engine lid hinges broken and the lid in the trunk.  Before you all
tickle my butt with flames over getting the damn thing checked for cracks,
Gird yourselves wwith this subtle fact: this car is a throwaway.  I will get
some use out of this machine with some careful manuevering BEFORE getting
serious about going all the way on a rebuild.  Besides, I'm in training and
this is my first Porsche engine...a great reason for academia no?
  If i really screw up, ill just be putting the final toasting on a motor 
that was already garbage. (this is engine one of three)

  In my case, there is a certain appeal to roasting the dickens out of a 914
  -for medicinal purposes only, of course...!

  So the damage is revealed and now its on to making some of it right
enough to restore minimal performance.  I just happened to have a set of
Mahle P/C's with some life in them (with new rings) so a quick swipe with
the hone and its back together again.  Honing cylinders is something rarely
heard of here, is there a reason for this?

  A quick glimpse within the rod bearing and
camshaft lobes showed extreme wear patterns, but these can wear and still
perform if good oil pressure/volume is gauranteed, which my new Melling
M-79AHV pump will provide.  In cleaning and preparing the way for pump
exchange, i notice the #2 reason for oil leaks near the front of the block:
the upper stud nuts are loose and the pump has been out and back in without
a new paper gasket.  So far, there's a turkey batting a thousand... 
  -It could be me,..i dunno.  I'm trying not to.

  Since having the heads off to do the P/C swap, i inspected the heads and
found the #3 cylinder had also had an intake valve seat drop out of its bore.
  It had been properly repaired, and the work looked remarkably like the #1
cylinder that i had just had repaired (bet it came from the same good shop).
  %50 seat failure!  Is this anything like lightning striking twice in the
same spot?  In that case, these heads should NEVER fail again -right?
  For this engine, it now has both heads reconditioned, new hivol oil pump,
recycled P/C's, new gaskets, and retorqued the entire case.

  The only thing i feel i neglected is the rod and crank bearings.
  I dont feel good about it, but for the short life i have planned for this
phase of the project, the engine will hold and the crank/rods wont get
munged IF THEY ARENT ALREADY.

  I bought a complete overhaul kit from EBS and it does not include rod
eye bearings, did i get hosed?  I'm aware these have to be fitted and 
reamed at a machine shop, but deleted from the kit?  This kit wont be used
until later.
 
  Hopfully the ListMeister wont summarily eviscerate me here on net_public for
having (in)descent liberties with a 914.  I spent the entire holiday working
on this bloody car...keeping my mind off the BURGLARY of my house just before
Christmas.  I'm fizzing shocked!!  They got some of my Porsche stuff, but
they didnt know what things were...they took my parts manual that I had laid
out for Alex Noordergraf for shipment...i see those are now $130, I paid 87
couple years back -as a PCA'er. so Alex now thinks i'm a schmuck...
Cleaned us out of most of our favorite possesions, we were insured, but the
paranoia remains. AWWshit...'93 was not a great year.  i worked too hard and
didnt get enuf done.

Subject: Re:  911/2 Trailing Arm Bushing Sqeak?

On the subject of squeaky bushings -

If you have to replace bushings, the only reasonable choice anymore is
plastic.  

In the Automotion catalog they claim that the squeaks experienced by
plastic bushing cars are not actually from the bushings, but from the
difference in "precision" between rubber and plastic.  Rubber is
more forgiving of the irregularities in suspension parts.  According
to automotion:

"We recommend installing each bushing and rotating it.  Remove the bushing
and you will be able to see evidence of any high spots on the suspension
bushing surface.  File or grind these flush until you have a bushing surface
free of high spots.  We also recommend a liberal dose of our special bushing
grease, containing teflon"

We have been able to significantly reduce suspension noise on a car
with 100% plastic bushings by doing this.  Note that using the 
grease alone does not always solve the problem, especially when
there are a lot of new plastic bushings.  However, caveat emptor -
this represents a LOT of work.  Installing a bushing is hard enough,
installing and then removing it and then installing it again is, well,
put it this way, by the time your finished you're language will make
Eddie Murphy seem like he really is Mr. Rogers.

Also note that the added stiffness of plastic bushings means that
other suspension parts will be taking loads that they didn't with
rubber, and will start making their own noises.

I agree that plastic bushings should really be for track use only,
but the rubber ones are hard to come by.  Most dealers don't even
carry them anymore.  Hmmmph.

Good luck.

Subject: 16 valve 944

I am planning on purchasing a 944 as my first Porsche.  My preference 
would be one with the 16 valve engine.  So, a couple of questions for 
the assembled wisdom of porschephiles:

 - what was the first year in which these engines were available?

 - what is the relationship between the 944S designation and the 16 
valve engine?  Is it an exact correspondence or does it vary by model year?

 - is the 951 8 or 16 valve?

 - anything (caveats) I should know about this engine versus the 8 valve 
engine?  For example, are there significant reliability or maintenance 
differences (other than the obvious doubling of valve job cost)?

 - is the increase in performance significant and worth the expense? 
Subjective question, of course; opinions welcome.  I do understand that 
speed costs money, I just want to find the optimal compromise for my budget.

Thanks,

Ah yess. Force Racing.

Technique == hardened steel synchros, instead of the "silly putty"
Porsche stock synchros. Advantage: synchros don't wear, hence you
get nice firm shifts for the life of your transmission...

Problems:  note how I said "life of your transmission"??? When
the synchros don't wear *ALL SORTS* or other things get to bear
load that was never intended. Net result: catastrophic failure of
things like mainshaft bearing journals, etc. -- in short (under 50k mile)
times.

>Any experience?

They *DO* feel very good. I'd recommend them for competition 
use only -- serious full-scale competition use where you *PLAN* to 
disassemble your gearbox every week or so anyway, because you'll
greatly extend the life with frequent bearing changes and regular
checkup on the hard part tolerances.

I've replaced a few MacPherson inserts.  It's not real easy!  You need 
a spring compressor, correctly sized strut cap removal tool, a vise 
(and maybe a vice, but that's another story), and a couple oddball 
box-end wrenches or other custom tool for the top of the tower.

It's a straight-forward job, ahem.  Both times I've tried it, I've had 
to take the strut to a shop and have them wail on the cap.

The strut is just a metal tube, so if it isn't fatigued or otherwise 
damaged I'd just replace the insert.  But then, replacing the whole 
strut means you won't have the horror stories I've described.

Yah, replace the whole strut!

YES you do need to retain the spring... normal spring compressors do the trick.
Don't try to do the job without this tool, it's quite literaly deadly, if not 
immposible. 

I've recently redone my shocks and bearings on both sides. You don't have to
remove the 4 small ones.

1. Apply spring compressor, with car on ground (saves a lot of time tightening the 
    compressors).

2. Jack car, remove wheel.

3. working in the engine bay, remove M14 centre nut, you'll need a 22mm offset
   ring and a 7mm allen key.

4. Push down shock strut, swing complete strut out way in the wheel arch under
    the fender, careful to not streeeeech the flexible brake line.
    (This is a good time to check play and whether the shock has an rough spots
     in its travel, if so time to replace!).

5.  You should now see a rubber donut thingy in the fender housing, this will
     push out and the new one push in....

6. (As they say in the Hanynes manual) replacment is the reverse of removal!!!

    (Btw I would replace the M14 nut.. reuse the old one to reassemble, when 
      you are happy put the new one on to finish the job... after say a short
      test run).

Subject: RE: 928 Dash -> cracked


**  Matt asks about covering or replacing the dash on his 928.  **

Matt,

I have a '78 911 SC and about 4 years ago, I ran into some major interior
damage.  It's too long and incredible a story to go into now.  Anyway,  There
was enough damage that warranted replacing all of the interior rather than
trying to match up 10+ year old materials.

I took my car to a upholsterer here in the Seattle area who specializes in
automobiles and is well respected by the local PCA region members.  He told me
the dash would be no probelm.  He could sew up new material to recover the dash
so that it looked just like new.  He even said that he could do it in leather
if I wanted to pay the price.  I chose not to go with the leather but instead
the same material as the rest of my interior.

All I can say is that my dash looked better than it ever had!  Even today, it
is still in perfect condition with absolutely no signs of wear or cracking. 
I'd say you might consider finding a "very reputable" local auto upholstere
(preferably one who has experience on cars such as Porsche, Mercedes, etc...)
and see what he thinks about this sort of task.

The man who did mine even sewed the two pieces together so that it looked
identical to the original.  If you didn't know it was a replacement, you would
never be able to figure it out!

I'm not sure what part of the country you are from but if you would like me to
give you the name and phone number of the guy who did my work, just let me
know.  I don't know what the price would be since mine was all part of a bigger
package.

Subject: Bushings

    A few months back when I was preparing to replace my rear torsion
    bars, I hunted around trying to find the OEM rubber
    bushings for the spring plates.  Since my car is a track car (that
    I drive to the track and sometimes around town), I was interested
    in the so-called plastic performance bushings, but wanted to
    know my options.  I discovered, as some others have, that for a
    1971 911 the only bushings that are available are the ones that
    come vulcanized onto the OEM spring plates!  I talked with a
    couple of people about another option:  Apparently the bushings
    for the later model cars (I think they were talking about SCs but
    I am not sure) could be purchased without the spring plate
    attached (kind of like buying a tire without the wheel attached -
    what a concept!).  The only problem is that the bushing was longer
    (hopefully the same diameter) and thus would require some fitting.
    Since the price of these OEM bushings was more than the plastic
    ones, and since I wanted as much "performance" as I could get, I
    opted for the race version of the plastic bushings.

    I discussed the squeaking with a couple of friends, one of which
    said he installed a zerk fitting after the squeaking drove him to
    the funny farm.  This seemed to help at least a little.

    I hope this helps.

914 1.8L Idle & Cold Start
Hi, gang.
    It turns out that I was *completely* barking up the wrong
tree on my FI.  The problem was (you probably guessed it)
electrical connections.  Although, to be fair, I probably would
not have found it even if I'd been looking at the connectors.
    Well, now I've got two more problems that are not *nearly*
as bad.
    1)  The idle is now erratic.  It cycles between 1000 RPM
and almost stalling.  In fact, it has stalled out on me twice so
far.
    2)  I now have to give it some throttle to keep it alive after
a cold start.  Before this latest service, the cold idle would
climb quickly (5-10 sec) to about 1700 RPM, and over the
course of 1-3 minutes, drop back down to 800+-, and after
a few more minutes, back up to 1000.  Is this second behavior
normal?  If so, I need to check the connectors on the Aux Air
Valve again.

Hey Welty,

With all the confusion between Oliver Stone and what's his
name, I thought we could go back to someone with a good car
name like Francis Ford Coppola. How about writing a parody of
"Apocolypse Now" with the Marlon Brando character played by Brew
Sanderson.

Here's the scenerio:

Brew has been giving conflicting advice about winter storage and 2.7
case reliability of 911's and must be re-certified with "extreme 
prejudice" Furthermore, he's exhibiting psychotic behavior by hiding 
in a rat hole called PAR (or is it PAP?) somewhere in the Bronx
surrounded be canibalized Porsches.

The mission is to drive up the New Jersey Turnpike in a 928
(closest I could come to a PT boat) to neutralize Brew Sanderson 
before he can do more damage. Along the way, they encounter 944's
with monster American V-8's at the NHRA Summer Nationals 
 "I love the smell of nitromethane in the morning"
There's also a highway surfing contest with rollerbladers behind 
914's. (There would be plenty of opportunities for ambush scenes
going through Newark)

Well, the salt is obviously on the roads here in the great northeast!

Actually Oliver Stone was the executive producer.  You might recall a scene

On a Porsche note:  anyone have a good pointer for finding a new wooden

I heard that maybe Ford has the same kind of tool for their kind of radio.  
You can also take your car to a Car Radio Shop and ask them to take your radio 
out.  

When you get your tool, put the tool in by spreading the prongs away from the 
radio and once the prongs are in the holes far enough, press the prongs toward 
the radio and pull the tool to get the radio out.  You want the prongs to grab 
the "hooks" on the side of the radio.  

CAUTION:
Once you have the radio out, your car alarm might be set off.  I know on the 
'89 and '90 C4 with the factory alarms, the radio was tied into the alarm.  I 
took the radio out of my '90 and the alarm was triggered but without the 
"sound" and the "flashing lights", therefore the alarm drained my battery 
while the radio was out.  I think Porsche fixed that problem starting with 
the '91 or '92 models.

There is some kind of bracket on the radio that must be "grounded" to the car 
for the alarm to work correctly.  You can bypass the radio from the alarm and 
not have this problem.

Both of these symptoms point toward a vacuum leak. I had almost

Certainly the Bosch rotors are cheaper, and the Marelli rotors hard to find,
but I'm loath to spend $500 for a new distributor, and the other Marelli owners
seem to have bought all the used Bosches.  If I can find a used 911T or L

What's your budget?  I tend to think that the prices on all the 944
series cars are so low and so close nowadays that there's not much reason
to buy anything other than the newest and most powerful one you can
afford.

If your friend still has the transmission mounted to the engine, the

and blast away with an air gun.  If you don't have the latter, I
think he'll need a flywheel lock or something like it to counterhold

Jim, 
	Two options as I see them, if you intend to continue to do this
	yourself:
	     1) Drill out the old bolt to the minor thread diameter.
		and try to peel out the remaining helix of thread.
		First though you must remove the broken off portion
		of the bolt extractor.... Chase the threads prior to 
		installing bolt.
OOOH!
	*** brilliant flash of light indicating original thought!**
	In the old days a model maker, working on a project for me,
	broke off a tap in a "One of a Kind Prototype". He fussed with it
	for a while, then gave up because the tap was too small to drill
	out etc. he said, "Lets just throw it in the bright dip tank
	overnight (weak sulfuric acid if I recall correctly) and see what 
	happens". He would have had to start over from scratch on this part
	so he had nothing to loose. The next morning the part was retrieved 
	from the bottom of the tank, lo and behold the tap was gone, and the
	Aluminum part was esentially untouched!
	The message here is Aluminum is attacked by Caustics, Acids have little
	affect on Aluminum. Ferrous Metals (Bolts, bolt extractors etc.)
	are attacked by acids, caustics have little or no effect on Iron
	Alloys.
	So, are you ready for this?
	Construct a little dam out of Plasticene Clay, Plumbers putty etc
	around your broken off bolt, obtain a weak Sulfuric Acid Solution
	and fill up the hole and dam. Go Away for 12 hours and see what's
	left. Then put a match to it!

		Back to Drilling!
		You could use your old waterpump housing for a drill guide
		by fabricating a steel drill bushing to press into the mating
		hole of the waterpump and bolt it back up to the block. This
		would give you a better chance of drilling true and square
		to the old hole. You may be able to punch the broken off
		extractor on through the old bolt and into the cavity behind
		it. Bolts holes are seldom tapped to the bottom of the hole
		drilled into the boss. Hopefully the bolt hole is blind for 
		both this and the "Acid Fix" to work.

	      2) Drill out and use a helicoil or other brand of thread insert.

	Or swallow your pride, and engage a proffessional to finish the job.
	There are many excellent Porsche mechanics in the Bellevue/Kirkland
	area. Give me a call if you need a referal.

Subject: 356 Tire Question

Regarding Stan's recent query for decent skinny tires for older 
cars:

I have a '67 912 that has the original 4.5" 1967 optional Fuchs 
alloys, so we share a simlilar quest for decent tires.

I used to run 185/70 Michelin XWX - which I understand was THE 
trick "soft" compound autocross tire a decade back.  I found 
them to be horrible - extremely stiff sidewalls full of bead 
filler, harsh riding, with unpredicatable breakaway 
characteristics and wicked wet-surface handling.  Also very 
expensive, and almost impossible to find today.  But they 
looked so RIGHT on an early 911/912...

I'm currently happily running Yokohama A-321vr's in 185/70 VR 
size/rating, and I'm very pleased.  The grip is every bit as 
good as an age-hardened XWX, even though they have a treadwear 
rating of 200.  They have flexible, quiet-riding sidewalls, and 
what appears to be nice, stiff tread.  The tread pattern is 
similar to (but not a copy of) the Pirelli P6.  But, unlike the 
P6, this is a modern, two-ply sidewall tire. 

This tire is not very common -- I got mine from Roger Kraus 
tires, a racing tire shop well-known in the SF Bay Area.  Based 
on the selection of sizes (all high aspect ratio) and VR 
rating, the tire appears to be designed for older European 
luxury/performance cars, such as Jaguars.  The modern 
construction is a really an improvement over my previous 
retro-tire experiment.  

You probably won't set any lap records with these tires, 
though.  Of course, for autocross I use fatter/lower A008RS's 
or Comp TA R1's on 6-inch wheels.  And usually win :)   But for 
street driving, I prefer the greater ground clearance, higher 
gearing, wet surface grip, and ride comfort of the A-321vr's.

Thanks for the great list.  - Eric Nichols

if there is a small piece of the

attach the bolt.The heat from the welder will in 95% of the cases
lossen the bolt.The only thing you need to do then is to get a hold on
whatever you attached to the bolt-extractor.(Often I've welded Umbraco(Hex?)
keys to broken bolts,then you'll get some leverage too.

If no piece of the bolt sticks out,(the most common problem) you
better drill it out.Not easy,even worse when your extractor is stuck
into it.

For the future remember to heat bolts that seem to be seized,*Before*
you try loosing them.Use a propane heater or anything that don't make
too much heat.

Subject: Re:  911/2 Trailing Arm Bushing Squeak

More on the subject of squeaky plastic bushings -

Recent postings have decried the lack of availability of the 
factory spring-plate (trailing arm) bushings.  I have a NOS 
set, purchased from Stoddard about four years ago for my '67 
912.  You may be wondering why I'm not using them...

While installing them, I noticed that they seemed softer than 
the old, worn bonded-rubber bushings that I meticulously carved 
off the spring plates.  I assumed that was due to the 
difference in age.  Hmmmm.

After reinstalling the rear suspension, setting the ride height 
(no alignment yet), and taking my beauty out for a spin, 
imagine my surprise when the car seemed to actually have a 
harsher ride - MUCH harsher than I'd remembered.  Further 
inspection revealed that the rubber douhgnuts were so soft that 
they had compressed to the point that the spring plate shaft 
was RESTING on the bushing cover plate, i.e., METAL to METAL! I 
might as well have installed Heim-joints from a 935!

Needless to say, out came the "OEM" parts and in went the 
well-known Poly-Graphite plastic bushings, in street-hardness 
(they come in two hardnesses, BTW).  I like them, they don't 
seem too harsh or noisy, the handling of the car is more 
precise, and they've never squeaked.  I think the secret to 
eliminating the squeak is to fastidiously clean the spring 
plates of all traces of the former vulcanized rubber bushings, 
and use a good grease.  I used Swepco Moly-grease.  Remember 
that the area where the rubber was bonded is now the 
bearing/rotation surface.

Moral of the story:  If you really want rubber, try and find 
new OEM spring plates with the vulcanized rubber bushings 
attached.  

While on the subject of spring plates:  I have a set of 
Sway-Away adjustable spring plates, but I haven't had the nerve 
to install them because of what seems to be excessive play 
between the bores of the two plate halves:  about .020".  Seems 
like this would allow undesirable movement and resulting toe-in 
changes while driving.  It seems like they could be shimmed to 
fill in the gap.  Have any of you racer types noticed this?  Or 
am I just being too anal?

77 911 keys don't have a different "code" for master vs. valet, they are just
the same cut on two different blanks.  Most locksmiths carry only the master
blank, so if you don't mind starting your prize with a noname generic part, 
just have your red valet key dupped.  Dealer price for the key blanks will
astound you (at least if you remember when it cost $.35 to have a new house-

better a $7.00 key than a $50 tie.

The acid idea is actually really good - wish I'd thought of it years ago
when I did this same trick to an exhaust stud on my Bug. Just make sure that
none of it gets anywhere else (like inside the engine).

You should forget about drilling out the broken screw extractor - it's
a good bit harder than the drill bits available from a common hardware
store. I went through 5 cobalt bits and only succeeded in breaking the
hardened metal into smaller pieces, at least one of which is probably still
embedded in the aluminum of the head. I now have a set of high-strength
dental probes and scrapers that I would try to use to dislodge the
extractor fragment. Maybe try to drill a small-diameter hole beside the
broken off "EZ-Snap", so you can get a suitable probe hooked around behind it
and pull it free. Or come up with diamond-tipped drill bits - the cobalt
ones are not going to cut it.

Then, once you get the hardened tool fragments out, see if you can find a
reducing stud. I was able to obtain a supply of 10mm to 8mm reducing studs
(Mike Kohlbrenner had one, with the appropriate tap which we proceded to
trash against the EZ-out fragment that "never came out", and I found a
few more at an auto parts place in Milford that "used to do a lot of
Bug stuff"). These are really nice - you drill out the hole to 9mm, then
run the 10mm tap through it, screw in the 10mm side of the reducing stud,
and voila, a nice 8mm stud sticking out. Be very careful about centering the
drill and drilling very straight. The stud was drive home by putting a pair
of 8mm id nuts on it, locking them together, and using the outer one as if
it were a bolt head. If 8mm is what you need for the 928 water pump, let me
know, I still have a couple of these studs in the toolbox.

I'd like to add my two cents to Malcom Smith's excellent procedure 
description (You ought to write for Hayes!).
	 On item 1, I think one would have to be a real contortionist to 
get a spring compressor on a  front spring with the car on the ground. 
There is enough clearance (just barely) under the fender to swing out the 
top of the strut without first compressing the spring. The spring is then 
MUCH more accessable to get the compressor on it.
	On item 3, finding a 22mm box end wrench with enough offset to 
reach the M14 locknut might be tough. An impact wrench with a 22mm socket 
(a 7/8" works just as well) will get this nut off/on without also having to 
hold the shock piston shaft with the 7mm allen key.
	Since putting in aftermarket springs is a frequently done handling 
upgrade, all 944/951philes who haven't done so already should keep this 
procedure in mind.

Since I live in the Northeast that was an untenable situation, and this fall I
bought 4 used phone dials and Pirelli Winter 190 205/55 16, (narrower than the
regular tires.)

We just had our first snowstorm and I can't begin to describe the
difference. The car is completely controllable, it brakes, goes around turns
and seems really good in the snow.

So, the key is SNOW TIRES!

.......................................................................

i talked to Kurt Weiss about the new rules last night; Kurt is on
the IT advisory committee and is also a prominent (and very good)
local cage builder, as well as an engineer for GE.  what
follows is a summary of what i got out of the conversation. 

evidently the new rules were prompted by the Showroom Stock rollover
accident at the runoffs involving an MX-3.  the MX-3 was equipped
with an Autopower bolt in roll cage.  the MX-3 is also distinguished
by the fact that the cage was somewhat elipsoid in shape, to follow
the contours of the car closely.  Autopower cages are made with
ERW tubing with walls of 0.120 thickness.  the cage failed because
the verticals of the main hoop bent as did the diagonal brace.  the
ERW tubing did not split at its seam in the accident.

Kurt feels that the new rule about 4 bends max in the main hoop
is a good one; he's always built cages that way.  he feels that
added tube wall thickness would not have prevented the failure; thicker
tube walls do not significantly alter the resistance to bending.
he would prefer to see that a horizontal cross bar be mandated
in the main hoop, which would function in tension to resist any
spreading of the main hoop.  in particular, he says (in agreement
with calvin sanders) that 0.120 DOM tubing for AS cars will double
the materials cost for an AS cage.

Subject: CO meters for 914 FI recal

Hello,
     I am interested in getting feedback from the net with respect to
CO analyzers. There is a unit advertised in the Pano Classifieds for
a unit called a Gastester ($125 - analog, $225 - digital) sold by
John Abbot. Has anyone had experience with this or other low priced
analyzers?
     My application is to recalibrate the FI on my 1972 914 motor
rebuilt to 1.9L. I would like to reset the pressure transducer to give
aprox. 4% CO at idle and then run the car under load and fine tune it.
I don't really need a high quality (ie $$) meter, just one for
occasional use.
     Also, if anyone out there has done a similar rebuild, I'd be
interested to know about your experience. Mine will have the 1.8L
96mm NPR kit (8/1 comp), 1.7L head rebuilt to 1.8 specs, and a stock
cam. It's going together this weekend!

Hi, Stan.
 
Just a footnote to the message I mistakenly posted privately yesterday.
Clark Anderson also performs a procedure called "boxing" the front trailing
arms to reduce flexing. I haven't had this done but the racers say it makes
a big difference. The procedure is to weld a U-channel to the trailing arm
to stiffen it.
 
Again, Clark Anderson does the front decambering. He can be reached at
408-269-9550. He's the brother of Bruce Anderson who writes for Excellence
and Pano. Tell Clark I sentchuz.
 
The cost of the decambering is very nominal, but I don't remember the cost
as it was done 3 years ago. He can do your arms or sell you fresh ones.
 
Regards,
 
Pete

I have used the acid idea, it was the only thing that worked.  Its
been a long time but someone actually sells an acid kit that comes
with a small block of clay and two bottles of acid that you mix
together, specifically for eating away steel fasteners in aluninum.  
I just can't remember who sells it.  I would try some specialty machine

Hi, Jim.
 
Well, you've really done it now. It's probably stuck thanks to anodic
corrosion between the steel stud and aluminum cover.
 
Hmm... I don't know if I like the idea of putting anything caustic on there.
It may work, but if it doesn't, you're looking at more expense.
 
The right way to do it is to have the stud electrically discharge milled
out. (EDM). Look in the phone book for tap and stud removal, or call some
machine shops to see who they use. It's not expensive, but you may have to
take the work to them (tow the car?). I have had this done on occasion, and
the cost is about $20 to $25 per hole. The old stud is completely removed,
without touching the aluminum. The threads are perfectly good afterwards.
The more drilling and such you're going to do, the more likely you are to
cut into the aluminum instead of just taking out the stud. Also you have a
hardened tap extractor stuck in there. That will NOT drill out. You would
have to grind it -- or EDM it -- if it doesn't come out easily by itself. I
don't think pounding anything in deeper is going to work either. Do the EDM,
learn about a different technique, and save yourself a lot of grief. Even if
you have to rent one of those little U-Haul car dollies (holds front or rear
wheels only) you're still way ahead.

Subject: 928 flashing dome light problem


  
  Right before I had to put the 928 ('82) to sleep for the winter <sigh> I 
  started to have this interesting problem.  When the car was cold (in the 
  morning, fresh out of the garage), the dome light would flash as I drove 
  down the road, and the 'door ajar' buzzer would buzz.  Often, this would 
  coincide with bumps in the road, and would stop when the car was at rest.
  After a few minutes, it would eventually stop.  I think this was because 
  the car heated up from the sunlight and heater.
  
  When the car is idling and stationary, I've pounded around a bit (a trick 
  I learned from 'Home Improvements' <grunt>) and found the most sensitive 
  part of the car is the area right beneath where the driver door would be 
  if it were closed.  I've tried removing the door-jamb switch and tugging a 
  bit on the wire attached to it, but that does not change the sensitivity 
  or the problem.
  
  Once, it even caused the alarm to go off while the car was stationary and 
  locked (of course, not in a well-lit parking lot or anything... late at 
  night while the leaves were blowing around!)  Since then, I've used the 
  non-arming key to lock the car to prevent *that* from happening again.
  
  I suspect a bare wire or something in that tunnel, bumping a ground, but 
  I can't get to it.  I tried to remove the carpet and plastic bit over the 
  tunnel, but all I see under it is the top metal part of the tunnel, and 
  it doesn't seem to de-attach from anything.
  
  Any ideas regarding causes or how-to-find-it advice?
  
  Thanks.

Subject: 356 tire summary

First, I want to thank everyone who responded on my Tire Quest.  Seems
that there really is a hard core of dedicated 356 people out there, 
just waiting for an opportunity to participate!

A couple of high points came in from Pete Albrecht (76416.167@CompuServe.COM)
whom you may or may not know did the translation for "Porsche 356 -
Driving in its Purest Form". He asked me to make sure and re-post this 
for the benefit of the other 356 guys out there, so I thought I'd just
hit the high points from my findings while I was at it... Anyway, Pete
sez:

After I asked him about where to get decambering done for front
spindles, and what offset the 5.5 wheels were (it's not a factory option)
he again replied...

>Clark Anderson does the decambering. You can call him at 408-297-2857. Tell

And Jonathan Blanchard (jmb@wuchem.wustl.edu) also contributed:

Further conversation with Jonathan about the cable operated camber
compensator *really* piqued my curiosity, so I'm going to hunt it 
down. More details as I learn more!!

P.S. In case you're wondering, I decided to order some P600s. Lots
of people seem to like them, and I can always put them on my wife's
Bug or use them as "roll-around" tires on my race car...

There is a German language convention for this.  If you cannot type the

Drew,

The PCA Club Racing rules still specify a halon fire extinguisher.  To
find out whether this will change, you should probably get in touch
with Bob Russo.

For region-sponsored events, it's up to the particular region.  We used
to specify only that it be a BC or ABC rated extinguisher of at least
2.5 lb.  We dropped the requirement of an extinguisher last year.

If you're tuning for a smog test or such like I guess you need
one, however if you tuning for the engine set up  I'd recommend
another of their products, The Colourtune. Basically it's a spark

slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What can you tell me about the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          President, NetSmiths, Ltd.
          2025 Lincoln Highway
          Edison, NJ 08817

     He lives in Houston TX and works in Edison NJ (Don't bitch about 
*YOUR* commute): 
          Houston: e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
                   voice:  (713) 661-2084 
                   FAX:    (713) 661-0633
          Edison:  e-mail: stan@netsmiths.com 
                   voice:  (908) 287-8070 
                   FAX:    (908) 287-3883

     His cars currently include:  
          '81 Euro 911SC Targa (daily driver when he's where it is)
          '74 914 2.0 (SCCA ITA/PCA Club Racing)
          '64 356 SC (OK, so he fell in love again).

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How is the list maintained?
     
     The list is maintained fairly regularly.  Stan tries to handle
changes at least once every other day.  There will probably be times
when he's on the road and less able to deal with problems, so be
patient.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  You can also 
reach Stan by phone at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070 when he's not
traveling.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What about Unix-based mail problems with the list?

     If you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay attention to 
your replies.  The default will send the reply to the "porschephiles-
request" address, as it is the UUCP "From" address (first actual line 
of the mail header).  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT STAN ROUTINELY TRASHES SUCH 
MIS-ROUTED MAIL!  If your mailer starts screwing up, you will be dropped
from the list.  Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any 
more, send Stan mail and he will do his best to figure out what's
happening.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the copyrights or ownership of material sent to the list?

     The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence
by and between members of a closed community.  As such, the copyright
for EVERYTHING that ANYONE posts lies with them.  PERIOD.  This is 
*NOT* a bulletin board system, where consent for further redistribution
is implied by nature of the the system; it's PRIVATE.  If you wish to
use something written by someone on the list, you must first seek their
permission unless they specifically grant the right in that specific
posting to reprint it at will.  And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD idea
to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing
up down the line.  Remember, when you read something on this list: what
you are reading belongs to whoever wrote it.  They may have plans to
publish it further themselves.  They may want to keep it "private"
(i.e. just for list member use).  They may not care what gets done with
it.  It's still theirs, and before re-use, permission must be
obtained.  Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a
big deal about it.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available on tta.com via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. 
There are no older archives available.  Remember, while it seems like a
good idea when you're first starting out on the list to know what has
gone on before, there are OVER 7 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP
THEM ALL AT ONE TIME.  Period!!!  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM
and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT
ask Stan to mail you archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you
will have to use BINARY mode in FTP.  Then on receipt, you need to use
the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent, to restore to textual
format.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are any images available on tta.com?

     Yes, some images from a variety of sources are available in
/pub/images.  Images are mostly in .gif format.  There is an UPLOAD
directory there as well, if you have images that you'd like to upload.
Please include a file called "from.<username>", where <username> is
your login ID that describes the files if possible.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Is anything else available in the archives?  

     Other information may be added from time to time.  Check the /pub
directory on tta.com for a current list.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Which clubs are there for Porsche owners?

     Several different clubs are available, depending on your interests
and location (this info is also on-line in /pub/pca/info, in case you 
forget to save this file):

          Porsche Club of America.
          P.O. Box 10402
          Alexandria VA 22310

Does take non-US membership.  You *MUST* have a Porsche VIN number to
join.  +1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are
$36/year.  Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number(s) handy, if
you own a car.  Or they'll send you an application which you can mail
in with your check.  National membership chairman is Nann Weissenberger
who is reachable via e-mail at n_weissenberger@harvard.edu.  You can
ask her for info or get her to send you an application as well.

          Porsche Club of Great Britain
          Ayton House
          West End
          Northleach
          Gloucestershire
          England GL54 3HG
          Telephone : +44 451 860792
          FAX       +44 451 860011

The Porsche club in Great Britain, obviously.

          356 Registry Inc.
          27244 Ryan Rd.
          Warren, MI, 48092

For 356 enthusiasts around the world.  $20 per year and cheap at twice
the price (Vic Skirmants' racing column is worth that, as are the
classifieds).  5000 happy members can't be wrong!

          914 Owner's Association
          100 South Sunrise Way, Suite 116
          Palm Springs CA 92262

Over 2000 members in over 20 countries.  Dennis Deeds published the 
club newsletter, Mid-Engined Views, quarterly.  Membership is $22 a 
year.

          "S" Registry

Contact Vern Lyle, Box 363, West Point, PA 19486 or at (215) 652-7011
(day), (215) 287-5083 (evening).  Dues are $20/yr with a quarterly
newsletter.  Dedicated to all early 911S models.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It may also be possible to get dealers to run a search for 
warranty repairs for your car.  At least some dealers are known to do
this for their customers.  This involves a search of PCNA records, and
only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  It's not known how
widespread this practice is among dealers, but it only applies to
warranty work done, not paid-for repairs/maintenance.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
            1970.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
            of the four-cylinder engine.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 to the 944 powerplant.
            Aerodynamically the best Porsche ever made.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the
            front, water-cooled, has grown from an original 4.5 litres 
            to 5.4 today.
     930  - Turbocharged 911, homologation and street version of the
            racing 934.
     931  - Turbocharged 924, available in 1980 and 1981.
     944  - Front-engined, water-cooled inline four cylinder car, with
            nearly perfect 50/50 weight bias.  Sixteen-valve and
            turbocharged versions were produced.  Produced from 1982
            through 1991. 2.5 litre displacement, except for a 2.7 litre
            eight-valve 944 model in 1989 and the 3.0 litre 944S2.
     951  - The turbo version of the 944.
     959  - Supercar 911 derivative.  2.85 litre, four valve, twin cam,
            dual turbochargers, all-wheel drive.
     964  - Another name for the 911 Carrera 4 and Carrera 2 as introduced
            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, due in showrooms in 4/94.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the meanings of terms and acronyms I've seen in the list?

     PCA  - Porsche Club of America, the major US/Canada Porsche
            enthusiasts organization.
     POC  - Porsche Owner's Club, the *other* US Porsche owner's group;
            in the past they have been more competition-oriented than 
            PCA, which has many interest groups participating.
     PCGB - Porsche Club of Great Britain.
     PCNA - Porsche Cars of North America (Reno, NV), the US importer
     PANO - Not an acronym; this stands for Porsche Panorama, the PCA 
            national monthly magazine.
     PAG  - Porsche AG, the mother company back in Stuttgart; "AG"
            stands for "Aktiengesselschaft," which means that the 
            company has publicly traded stock.

What are some of the major Porsche aftermarket suppliers?

     Be aware when buying a part in the aftermarket that it may or may
not be the same part you would get from Porsche.  This holds true even
when the part carries the "correct" Porsche part number, and when it
carries Porsche's parts trademark.

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books:

  Bruce Anderson
  Porsche 911 Performance Handbook
  Motorbooks International

  Duane Spencer
  Porsche 356 Performance Handbook  

  Dr. Brett Johnson
  The 356 Porsche: A Restorer's Guide to Authenticity
  The 911 and 912 Porsche: A Restorer's Guide to Authenticity
  The 914 and 914/6 Porsche: A Restorer's Guide to Authenticity
  Beeman Jorgensen Inc.

  Charles O. Probst
  Bosch Fuel Injection & Engine Management
  Robert Bentley, Inc.

  Fred Puhn
  How To Make Your Car Handle
  HP Books

There are also Haynes manuals available for most models.  While the
Haynes manuals tend to be very weak on specifics having to do with
different model years and variations, they are good at teaching how-to
procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

From: Robert B Mohan <rmohan@afit.af.mil>
Subject: Re: RSR Jacking Systems

About the 911 RSR 3.8

The 911 RSR is available with an optional automatic jacking
system.  The other available option is center-lock hubs.
I had the opportunity to crawl around the Rohr Motorsport
911 RSR last month in Cincinatti.  Their car has both options.

The jack system is a 3-point system, one on centerline just
ahead of the 100 liter fuel cell, and two just ahead of the
rear wheels in the passenger compartment.  There is a male
quick disconnect fitting in the cowl just ahead of the wind-
shield on the passenger side.  You attach a standard air hose
and the system does the rest.  Disconnect the hose and the car
remains up until you pull the ring at the base of the fitting.
The air discharges, and springs assist to retract the stands
fully into the body.

The fuel cell is basic TRS: foam-filled, rubber cell, stainless
case, spring-loaded dual receptacle filler nozzle (gravity feed).

The center lock hubs use the same wheels as the standard 5-bolt
hubs.  Instead of lugs, there are 5 centering pins, and a small
center stud and lug nut which uses the hole behind the center
cap.

The car comes from Porsche with a full Matter cage, dual kill
switches, fire system with dual actuator switches, but no window
net or door bars (IMSA reqt.)  The only interior pieces are the 
dash and RS America door panels with locks and roll-up windows.

The engine has pulse injectors and low buterfly throttles, and
the fuel flow is a function of THROTTLE POSITION ONLY.  No
air flow meter, mass flow sensor, or anything. The manifold has
a resonance chamber between the banks a la 928.

Look for them at Daytona in Feb:  Jochen Rohr and John Osteen.

	Your shorting problem can be anywhere in the circuits that activate
	the Dome light or the accessory sense circuit.
	I had a similar problem in my 911, and found the sense circuit
	shorted to the ground clip at the dome light itself.
	The "sense circuit" is the one which triggers your alarm,
	or deactivates any accessories when the door is opened. 
	In the late 911 the power windows will work after the key is off
	untill you open the door.
	Look for your problem at each node of the system, ie dome lights,
	as well as the switches. There is little likelyhood of the short

	been some major body damage at some time in the past.

Heard of it - experienced it - and trying to figure out how
to get home on it tonight!

The main roads are well salted (P-Car safely garaged), but we've 
had 10 or 12 hours of freezing rain by now. The side streets look 
just wet, but are actually covered with about an inch of clear ice.

I've had fog turn to ice on the roads over there, and that's
an interesting experience too.

Good weather to read old car magazines.

OK, OK, it's really what we're seeing in metro NYC area this weekA,

from some of the road-patch compounds in use. Nasty stuff as you get

Oh, yes!  OH, YES!!  We have a lot of it here in Michigan, especially this time
of year.  Well, actually not right now, because everything is covered with
snow, but with thawing and freezing, black ice can wreak havoc.  BTW, what we
mean by black ice is the ice that forms on road surfaces, especially blacktop,
in the little indentations between the gravel/sand in the paving compound.  You
can't see it.  It doesn't even reflect light enough to creat glare.  But it's
there! And when you hit it just right, you're off in the toolies.....or into
the fender of the car beside you, in front of you, etc.
Nasty stuff.

Yes, here in Canuck land black ice is frequently warned about on the radio
road reports.  Just recently a driver who spun out on apatch of it had his
videocamera with him and recorded the mayhem that followed.  There is
something quite threatening about seeing and oldsmobile beaverwagon(one
with fake wood motif on the sides) towing a couple of snowmobiles and 
spinning out right infront of you.  Usually black ice occurs here on clear
days where the road appears to be clear of snow and ice but is wet from
ice and snow blowing onto the road or coming off of cars on the road.  If
the road is busy the ice doesn't have a chance to form, however if there
is a strong wind chill factor it can form instantly.  Drivers are caught
unaware because the road looks clear.

Here in the Northwest USA (Washington state and surrounding states), 
black ice is a common occurrence.  I am not a meteorologist, but I 
believe it is caused by dew forming on the road surfaces in the 
evenings as the temperature drops below the dew point.  The temp 
continues to drop through the night and the dew freezes.  It appears 
black because it changes the reflective characteristics of the asphalt 
surface.  If the late night/early morning temps are below freezing, 
then one must be on their toes whilst driving or they could find 
themselves in a ditch!

Happy Driving!

Fred,

I agree with what you write.  I don't know who propagates this myth about
944's (and Porsches in general) being no good in the snow.  Probably
concours nuts who don't even drive in the rain.  If you have a great
suspension and 50/50 weight distribution, what on earth else could you
ask for?  Ah, tires of the right size and design.

I put Pirelli 190's on my car too.  The shop bought and sold a Carrera
which was wearing them, but the new owner wanted something other than
snows.  So the price to me was pretty good.  I have 205/55x16 on the
front, 225/50x16 on the rear.

The car is quite good now in the snow.  I'd really prefer a smaller
tire (195 sounds about right).  But I think what I really need to do
is decamber the thing.  Snow tires simply do not work well at the kind
of camber we run at the track!  (For those of you in the Northeast,
yes, I have been driving the car all week.)

Malcolm,

I think "black ice" is a term which describes road ice that is invisible
to the eye.  Probably a result of melt-water freezing, especially late
in the day.  I ran into a whole bunch of it driving back from Toronto
last week.  It accumulated under bridges, and I was initially surprised
as the car (a Benz) got suddenly and seriously loose.

  Yes, not only have i heard of it- we have it several times a year!

  It happens when the temperature drops below freezing while a gentle
rain occurs.  Its weird because the stuff is frozen solid and bounces
off the windscreen, leaving it dry and offering no clue to its presence.
  This usually happens at night and starts with dry roads.  The temps
drop enough but may not actually go below freezing, at higher altitude,
the particles freeze then drop thru to the warmer air near ground and
thaw just enough to 'powder coat' the tarmac.  The coating is CLEAR
and slick as oily marbles.  The tarmac shows thru this coating as
BLACK road surface, fooling the eye into thinking the road is clear and
dry...until you hit your brakes or go to accelerate.
  I had a terrifying
trip to Denver going west on I-70.  Driving an old ford van with a trailer
load of hardware, went for about 30 miles wondering what was wrong with
the road.  When i went to slow for a stop -i nearly jackknifed, after i got
stopped, i fell on my keester when i got out.  You actually have to get
out and feel the road surface with your hand.  I put chains on my rear
wheels and drove no more than 35mph from Goodland to just outside Denver.
 The chains helped very little, the weight of my truck is what saved me.
  It was like slaloming, and my trailer helped keep me on a straight course.

  Since then, I DREAD commuting on I-70 during winter. That stretch
between the Kansas border and Denver can get deadly.
  Every year a story of how some poor souls DIED in their cars (4X4 jeeps
too) because they got snowbound (after ignoring the closing gates) and
thought THEY were the chosen few who could make it...natural selection.

  This is one of nature's  U-CANT-TOUCH-THIS

  Temperature and amount of moisture and stratification all play a role
in what falls out of the clouds...
  -i know this is profound-
  If conditions are right, the stuff can fall like BB's, that is called
GRAUPEL -it's like pelleted snow.  Ice encased pellets.  Gravel water.
  If the rain is real heavy and the upper air mass is cold & windy enough
it become hail.  We get it in all sizes around here, the seasonal cusps
are the worst. Is it gonna rain water or ice balls, put the mattress on
the car, quick!  
  Go ahead, ask me about the Tornadoes! i've met 'em on the turnpike, and
pulled over to let all THREE of them PASS.

There is a German language convention for this.  If you cannot type the

Folks,

Perhaps someone out there has had a similar experience.  I installed
the oil cooling system from a 944 Turbo into my 944S.  Works great,
but what I've noticed recently is that at speed the oil temp runs
too cool.

It appears that the oil thermostat is stuck open.  This conclusion
based on observing that the oil runs cooler with the car at speed,
then runs up to a more sensible temperature in traffic.  I also put
a pyrometer on the oil radiator and found that it was at almost oil
temp.

Has anyone seen this, and if so, what was the cause?  Do the
thermostats themselves fail, or perhaps is it the spring retaining it
in the filter base manifold?

I'd like to add my two cents to Malcom Smith's excellent procedure 
description (You ought to write for Haynes!).
	 On item 1, I think one would have to be a real contortionist to 
get a spring compressor on a  front spring with the car on the ground. 
There is enough clearance (just barely) under the fender to swing out the 
top of the strut without first compressing the spring. (Of course ya gotta 
jack up the car and take off the tire first.) The spring is then 
MUCH more accessable to get the compressor on it.
	On item 3, finding a 22mm box end wrench with enough offset to 
reach the M14 locknut might be tough. An impact wrench with a 22mm socket 
(a 7/8" works just as well) will get this nut off/on without also having to 

hold the shock piston shaft with the 7mm allen key.
	Since putting in aftermarket springs is a frequently done handling 
upgrade, all 944/951philes who haven't done so already should keep this 
procedure in mind.

Subject: seeking advice - 2nd (3rd) car

Hi gang,

Noticing that at least half of the country is having what I would call
yuck weather, I am fairly certain that most of the members are not driving
their Porsches....to work, to play, etc.  But what are you driving?

We have been looking for that elusive 'family' car.  Have looked through
Kiplinger's, Car and Driver, and Motor Trend.  The Dodge Intrepid (LH series)
seemed like an acceptable choice for room/price.  However, with their 
'cab forward' design, the car has an incredibly slanted front windshield and 
a pillar (post) that limits vision from the front right side.

Some things we have to take into account.  I (Pam) am six feet tall, and my 
height is mostly in my legs.  I have tall (albeit young) children.  Three 
members of the family have severe allergies to the point where a re-circ 
switch on the a/c is highly desirable if not required.  I have limited 
mobility at times, which means that automatic door locks/windows, power 
mirrors would be nice, and, of course, I need an automatic transmission 
(column shift would be nice - no button to push on floor shifter).  If the 
car only comes in a 4 cylinder version it is going to have to have the 
capability to handle hills at 55-70 mph, with 'full bleed' (everything 
running).

Oh, we'd like the car to not bankrupt us, too.  We are considering a lease,
especially since we have several major 'purchases' looming.  Trade-in of 
944 not a necessity, but something we would consider.  So, call $20k a 
limit.

Things noted from the past:

I have never been able to comfortably fit in any Honda model in any year. 
My arms don't comfortably reach the steering wheel when I leave enough room 
for my legs.  
After my Celica purchase (last new car purchase) I swore I would never own 
another Toyota product - maintenance hassles and poor workmanship (cheaper 
than Porsche, but who wants their car in the shop every other week?).  My 
parents had similar complaints with a Celica and Corolla - especially with the
automatic transmission in the Corolla.  
We have seen catastrophic paint finish problems on three different Buick
models owned by family members.


So, any advice appreciated.  Since this isn't exactly Pfile related you may
want to consider replying to us directly. [collopy@leland.stanford.edu]

Yep, I understand and certainly didn't mean to imply you should change

grammatical incorrectness of "Upfixin' der Porsche."  Should be "Upfixin'

Subject: Replacing Struts 86' 951

Thanks Again, KEVIN G, JIM S, Malcom S, Lance F, and everyone  who has
contributed information about the strut replacement, A GREAT HELP! I am
re-submitting the original text with deletions and additions. If there are any
other hints or suggestions that would help, let me know.I am going to attempt
the job in a couple of days. So here is your last chance to save me. My wife is
leaving the house until I am finished with the job, has a lot of faith in me
huh. (replacing the struts on my 86 951). I have been experiencing severe
(intermitent) steering wheel shimmy. Comes and goes when I change lanes and at
speeds of 50+ MPH. As a result of getting my questions answered by all you
helpful folks, It has been determined that the problem exists with the strut and
it's associated components not the wheels as previously thought,local mechanics
also agree.There is play in the upper strut area when the wheel is pulled out at
the bottom and pushed in at the top,or vice versa.There is also a bit of play in
the strut itself, where the shaft enters the strut.A mechcanic was presented
with the intermitent wheel shimmy problem, he checked for play in the wheel as
described earlier and quickly stated that I needed upper strut bearings? (Just a
note:the wheel bearings were replaced and repacked just recently) Not any play
in this area.I seem to have a problem that he does not also reccomend that the
struts be replaced, afer all the car has 87k miles on it with it's original
struts. Another mechanic who has experience in racing said that I should also
replace the strut as well. Once the strut is removed I would like to replace all
the other related parts that also may be worn or damaged. Can someone help me
with the parts that commonly wear out, thus in turn causing this problem.( I
have a parts fich so part #'s and or descriptions would be very helpful.I have
ordered the upper strut bushings(suspension strut mounting)as per fich Part #
944.343.071.00 .I also ordered new nuts (2 each M-14's) and (8 each M-8's) just
in case. Which struts should I get for road use? Will the koni's adjusted at the
softest rebound setting be to hard for normal driving conditions( with some
aggressive street driving)? How much difference will there be from the original
sach's with 87k miles on them? I have ordered Koni's from a mail order company
(yellow adjustable sport shocks) @ 158.00 each. If I don't do the rears, is this
a problem? Original sach's on rear.

I would like to attempt this job with a friend, is it very difficult? Do I need
any special tools? I have heard that a special Porsche tool is required to
remove the M-14 22mm nut at the top of the strut housing. Is there really not an
offset wrench that will work to remove this locking nut? The place where I
purchased the struts said that they have made a tool by welding a cut off wrench
to a 22mm deep socket. A good idea? Does this nut have to be re torqued to a
specified ft/lbs.When you remove the nut I imagine that the 7mm hex key holds
the shock from turning, while the 22mm nut is loosened counterclockwise? Could
any one elaborate on how the concentric cam(at the bottom of the strut) is
marked in order not to "completely" throw the front out of alignment? Is any
type of locking agent used on the nuts during reassembling? Any ideas of what to
do, or what not to, when using the spring compressors? The 4 nuts(M-8) holding
the bearing flange don't have to be removed do they? I do realize that a
complete 4 wheel alignment must be performed following this procedure.



Any help I would greatly appreciate.

    It'd probably be pretty hard to see on cars like the 914, where
the tops of the plugs are from one to four inches below the sheet-

From what I gather reading the net, most of your chariots are all safely
stowed away for the winter.  Mine, a 944S2, still has to provide service when
the pavement is clear.  Trying to start it this AM, with the temp hovering
around 5 degrees F., I encountered the groan of the battery.  I have several
questions:
1) any special precautions other than the normal safety issues when trying to
jump start the car?
2)  any special issues when trying the charge the battery while in place?
3) does the net wisdom feel that the costs of a PORSCHE labeled battery are
worth the cost compared to the generic Sears or some other local issue?
4) in changing the battery, are there any issues, like priming the alarm system
or the factory installed radio?
Thanks.

     I just replaced the cam tower oil lines, and was able to get
the fitting behind the distributor without removing the
distributor.  I did remove the piece of shrouding feeding the
heater system.  Test before complete reassembly.  It can be hard
to tell when the collar in the compression fitting has sealed.
It's about as tight as you can get it with a standard open-end.
Mine leaked on the first try :(  Further tightening fixed it.
It's hard to tell by feel how tight is enough with those

Subject: Seeking Advice - 2nd Car

Pam and Paul,

I have a "93" LH (Eagle Vision TSI) that I bought in November, 1992 that I am 
quite pleased with.  It is one of the few cars that I can drive 800-900 miles 
in a day and still feel good about it when I get out (my "87" 951 is the other 
one).  The seats are very comfortable, there is lots of room inside and in the 
trunk as well.  I have no major problems with the car after 18,000 miles.  The 
Winter performance here in the Great White North (Duluth, Minnesota) is very 
good.  I have mixed feeling about the traction control but the ABS is 
invaluable.  At least they give you a switch to shut the TC off, I like to 
decide when I want to spin the tires.  The only other complaint is that the 
"uprated suspension option" comes with Michelin tires that don't seem to be as 
good wet/snow tires as the Goodyear Eagle GT+4's that come with the standard 
touring suspension.  

You might want to take a look at the new Ford WindStar minivan, it appears to 
be quite a bit more advanced than the other vans on the market.  I have a 
friend that owns an "62" 356B and a "86" 951 as well as assorted Alfa's and 
Honda's but swears by his Dodge minivan with the four wheel drive option. 

To many choices,

  er, my significant spouse has got the hots to buy a car.
  With some careful maneuvering, perhaps i can add direction to her mania.
  As of now, she's stuck on a '85 IROC Z-28, we can get it for $5500
and i have warned her of the repairs the car needs before i will certify it
as reliable, about 1K worth...for openers.  Sorry to mention it here...

  In the paper yesterday was two 944's.  An '84 and an '85, both were
around $7000 and the owners were unaware of belts, water pumps, etc.
  So either of these would be subject to certification work before I would
trust them, at least $1000 worth...for openers.
  Like most car purchasers, she does not want a garage queen after laying out
6 or seven grand -even if it is a Porsche (or IROC).

  I know there has been a lot of talk about the 944 and its variants, prices
and features.  Is it true that the later year cars with more bugs worked out
and more features (16 valve, or turbo'ed) are selling for nearly same as the
older models?  Someone (Fred Pack?) had suggested going for the most since
the costs were near same for the later features.
  It makes sense to me.
  What are fair prices for 944's across the years?

  Please help me avoid the detroit hardware syndrome...

Subject: Setting geometry

Hi All,
I have a question for the autocross and time trial enthusiasts out there.

I have a 928GTS which I have run in all the local PCA autocross events here in
Salt Lake last year and also in 1 time trial event at Las Vegas last spring.

Now my problem is that after having my camber set to the outside tolerance of
the factory camber (-50') I still have severe wear on the outside of both
front tyres. The rears seem indifferent to daily or track events (they wear
just as fast either way ;-) ). Before having the camber/castor adjusted the
front tyres would use part of the sidewall for grip even with the pressure up
to 48lbs!

So finally my question, I will need to have more negative camber added ..but
how much? I will need to get a shop to change it as I have no way to get under
the car. How much would be a godd start. I have a Pyrometer now but am not
sure to add another 10' 30' or 1 degree or more, as I want to travel to the
shop for readjustment as little as possible.

How much negative camber is possible to adjust in anyway. Any thoughts would be
greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I KNEW some smart aleck wouldn't be able to resist and would take my bait!

Actually, my guess is that the 'floatation coefficient' is proportional to the
quantity of VW parts...since VW Beetles float. :-)

Subject: Looking for a 914 wiring harness.

Hi all,

Hope everyone had a great New Year celebration.
Well, I finally got all the bugs worked out of my engine build-up. It's
been a thoroughly educatonal experience overcoming all the mishaps and
bad luck(if it weren't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any at all) that
have happened over the past few months. And now that I've got Snapper
under its own power and running on all four cylinders, I decided to try
and tackle the electrical gremlins I've got. Upon closer inspection, I
found that the previous owner had bastardized the whole works with butt
connectors all over the place, wire extentions running the gamut from
three inches long to about two feet, of course with butt connectors on
each end, and at least one misplaced circuit on the fuse panel. Not to
mention having one of the largest circuits with the most stuff coming
and going from it completely disconnected. And the fuse box was hanging
from under the dash with enough tangled wires, taped splices, and butt
connectors for a bald eagle to make its nest!
   Well, I think it would be easier to rip out the whole nightmare and
start over from scratch with a complete, intact harness. I'm hoping
and praying that one of you out there has a complete wiring harness for
a '72 914 that you are willing to part with for a reasonable price/swap
or other form of compensation. I have some spares that could possibly
be traded. Does anyone have a harness laying in their garage or parts
bin? If you can help me, please get in touch and let's talk, *SOON*!!

Thanks,

Keep the ignition off when attaching the cables, do the ground

No, see #1.

I'd avoid the Porsche battery.  You'll pay less and get more CCA's from 
a Diehard battery.  They're around $65-$75, vs. $100+ for the Autobahn 
one.  I feel they last longer too.

You shouldn't have to do a thing, unless during cranking the battery 
went real low and zeroed the radio memory, etc.  Your radio will tell 
you this for sure.  The alarm should be OK.

Good luck,

Subject: 911 MFI --gas in the oil blues

Well, my 72 911T has been hibernating for about six weeks so far into
winter. This weekend, however, the sun was shining so I took it upon
myself to replace my warped oil plate with a used one (Parts Werks, $20)
and grab perhaps a quick drive in the winding wheat field roads of eastern
Washington state.  Draining my oil (pretty recent too, < 500 miles) I smelled
gas in the oil big time :{P.  Somewhere I remember reading that mechanical
fuel injections systems can have this problem. Where is the likely
place to start looking? the pump or the injectors?  Anybody been here
before?  Gas is not an oil additive I want. Here are a couple of background
hints about the car, 89K on engine, second MFI pump with 150K on it, injectors
were tested (and passed) in September after my gas tank problem. The car did runpretty well before I put to its winter sleep. I do think the gas was 
in oil when I put it away rather than leaking out the injectors. 
This makes me suspect the injection pump ($$$). Thoughts?
  
There is never a dull moment when you try to resurrect these wonderful cars. 
Thanks for your input. Oh, I did get a quick 911 dose before the weather 
changed.

I'm not sure where you'd get it in the US. It's widely available in the UK
(like most major car spares places), so I just bought mine round the corner.

If I remember I'll bring the manufacturers address to work so you ask them 
directly. Gunsons make all sorts of "clever" (i.e simple == cheap but effective)

 -malc-

p.s. Someone asked me how it would work with a 911. The answer is with difficulty!
They provide  little tube that extends to a mirror so that you can see around awkard
places. I've used it in a VW Type 1 which is similar in problem. What you are looking
for it the colour of the flame so direct sight is not essential.

Subject: Seeking Advice- 2nd (3rd) Car

Regarding what car to drive when the Porsche is in the garage, I highly
recommend a Taurus SHO.  I have a '92 and love it.  It has all the good
stuff--ABS, air bag(s), great engine (220 HP 24V DOHC Yamaha).  It handles
and sticks well, and w. FWD it's good in snow.  It does 0 to 60 in the low
sevens and tops out at 140 plus.

What's also nice about it is it's still basicallly a Taurus--unlike my
Porsche, I can park it anywhere without worrying and the cops barely notice. 
I have two and there is plenty of room for more in the back.

Also, as of the '93 model year, it comes with an auto (mines the 5 speed so
I'm not sure whether it's on the column or console.

Finally, price.  I bought my '92 in October of that year.  Just after the new
ones had come out.  I paid $17,500 for a car that stickered at $23,000.

Subject: valve adjust w/dial gauge

I use cobbled up brackets for both, but I would think the cam adjust holder
would NOT fit for setting valve lash.  Cam adjust measures valve movement, and
assumes a specific lash setting.  Valve adjust measures rocker free play, and
assumes the valve doesn't move.  When I measure it, I'm just checking my work
with the blade, and I measure to the adjustment screw.  It would be a pain to
swap the gauge on and off while adjusting that same screw, I would think.

Does anybody have an easy way to do this?

The current golden gate region rules allow up to 2.5 degrees negative 
for cars still driven on the street.  

I'm running 1 deg in front and 1.5 in back (on a 911) and *it is not 
enough!*  I need at least another half degree, probably a full degree.

For a 928, I'd probably go with 2 degrees (negative) in front.

Also, do not just go to the local tire store and have them do the
adjustment.  I did that and the rear got set -1.75 and -2.5 degrees.

It was bad, I only had about 85% braking due to the early lockup of the
 -2.5 degree tire.  

I'd find a shop experienced with 928 competition allignment and tell 
them what you want.  It's worth the extra money, in fact it's probably
cheaper.

Remember, an alligment that will optimize performance, will wear your
tires faster on the street.

Kevin,
  When I was Der Gasser editor the first time, and still had some command of
my German, I mentioned that and was told that after 20 + years, it was
unlikely that anyone would be interested in spelling it Riesentoeter,
especially since it was a contrived word.  Suspect for the most part, people
don't take it that seriously.

Hi gang,

Noticing that at least half of the country is having what I would call
yuck weather, I am fairly certain that most of the members are not driving
their Porsches....to work, to play, etc.  But what are you driving?

We have been looking for that elusive 'family' car.  Have looked through
Kiplinger's, Car and Driver, and Motor Trend.  The Dodge Intrepid (LH series)
seemed like an acceptable choice for room/price.  However, with their 
'cab forward' design, the car has an incredibly slanted front windshield and 
a pillar (post) that limits vision from the front right side.

Some things we have to take into account.  I (Pam) am six feet tall, and my 
height is mostly in my legs.  I have tall (albeit young) children.  Three 
members of the family have severe allergies to the point where a re-circ 
switch on the a/c is highly desirable if not required.  I have limited 
mobility at times, which means that automatic door locks/windows, power 
mirrors would be nice, and, of course, I need an automatic transmission 
(column shift would be nice - no button to push on floor shifter).  If the 
car only comes in a 4 cylinder version it is going to have to have the 
capability to handle hills at 55-70 mph, with 'full bleed' (everything 
running).

Oh, we'd like the car to not bankrupt us, too.  We are considering a lease,
especially since we have several major 'purchases' looming.  Trade-in of 
944 not a necessity, but something we would consider.  So, call $20k a 
limit.

Things noted from the past:

I have never been able to comfortably fit in any Honda model in any year. 
My arms don't comfortably reach the steering wheel when I leave enough room 
for my legs.  
After my Celica purchase (last new car purchase) I swore I would never own 
another Toyota product - maintenance hassles and poor workmanship (cheaper 
than Porsche, but who wants their car in the shop every other week?).  My 
parents had similar complaints with a Celica and Corolla - especially with the
automatic transmission in the Corolla.  
We have seen catastrophic paint finish problems on three different Buick
models owned by family members.


So, any advice appreciated.  Since this isn't exactly Pfile related you may
want to consider replying to us directly. [collopy@leland.stanford.edu]

Yep, I understand and certainly didn't mean to imply you should change
it.  What I do find weird is that National has never picked up on the
grammatical incorrectness of "Upfixin' der Porsche."  Should be "Upfixin'

Subject: 928 flashing dome light problem


  
  Right before I had to put the 928 ('82) to sleep for the winter <sigh> I 
  started to have this interesting problem.  When the car was cold (in the 
  morning, fresh out of the garage), the dome light would flash as I drove 
  down the road, and the 'door ajar' buzzer would buzz.  Often, this would 
  coincide with bumps in the road, and would stop when the car was at rest.
  After a few minutes, it would eventually stop.  I think this was because 
  the car heated up from the sunlight and heater.
  
  When the car is idling and stationary, I've pounded around a bit (a trick 
  I learned from 'Home Improvements' <grunt>) and found the most sensitive 
  part of the car is the area right beneath where the driver door would be 
  if it were closed.  I've tried removing the door-jamb switch and tugging a 
  bit on the wire attached to it, but that does not change the sensitivity 
  or the problem.
  
  Once, it even caused the alarm to go off while the car was stationary and 
  locked (of course, not in a well-lit parking lot or anything... late at 
  night while the leaves were blowing around!)  Since then, I've used the 
  non-arming key to lock the car to prevent *that* from happening again.
  
  I suspect a bare wire or something in that tunnel, bumping a ground, but 
  I can't get to it.  I tried to remove the carpet and plastic bit over the 
  tunnel, but all I see under it is the top metal part of the tunnel, and 
  it doesn't seem to de-attach from anything.
  
  Any ideas regarding causes or how-to-find-it advice?
  
  Thanks.

Subject: RE: 3.0 engine/trans questions

1. 915 trans.:
     comments were made last week about Force Racing synchros--depends on
your goals and how much you want to spend.  Better question--only 75K on
trans?  no reason to go into it unless it won't shift (i.e. broken coupling
teeth).
     only other mod is 7:31 ring & pinion (w/ change of 5th gear) and/or
Quaife differential.

2. early 3.0 SC engine mods:
     low compression is the problem here, Porsche says 8.5:1, more like 8.1:1
in reality.  European "9.8:1" work fantastic, 80-83 "9.3:1" are also popular,
gives much better throttle response.  You already have the "big runner" CIS
w/ large port heads. SSI works good too, if no smog laws in the way (tricky
here in CA).  Muffler is VERY important, Bursch for low $$$, B&B if you have
the money--you'll be disappointed if you get a generic factory type, if you
want quiet, factory Leistritz the only way ($$).
    Carburetion will get you nothing more than a little better throttle
response on an otherwise unmodified low compression engine!
    At 75K your factory valve guides are shot, too.

An aside:  I just joined in this last week, and after I put my profile in a
couple of days ago, I just want to say thanks to all who have sent questions!
I'll try to do my best to answer quickly!!  How many other mechanics/shop
owners on this???

  Yes, not only have i heard of it- we have it several times a year!

  It happens when the temperature drops below freezing while a gentle
rain occurs.  Its weird because the stuff is frozen solid and bounces
off the windscreen, leaving it dry and offering no clue to its presence.
  This usually happens at night and starts with dry roads.  The temps
drop enough but may not actually go below freezing, at higher altitude,
the particles freeze then drop thru to the warmer air near ground and
thaw just enough to 'powder coat' the tarmac.  The coating is CLEAR
and slick as oily marbles.  The tarmac shows thru this coating as
BLACK road surface, fooling the eye into thinking the road is clear and
dry...until you hit your brakes or go to accelerate.
  I had a terrifying
trip to Denver going west on I-70.  Driving an old ford van with a trailer
load of hardware, went for about 30 miles wondering what was wrong with
the road.  When i went to slow for a stop -i nearly jackknifed, after i got
stopped, i fell on my keester when i got out.  You actually have to get
out and feel the road surface with your hand.  I put chains on my rear
wheels and drove no more than 35mph from Goodland to just outside Denver.
 The chains helped very little, the weight of my truck is what saved me.
  It was like slaloming, and my trailer helped keep me on a straight course.

  Since then, I DREAD commuting on I-70 during winter. That stretch
between the Kansas border and Denver can get deadly.
  Every year a story of how some poor souls DIED in their cars (4X4 jeeps
too) because they got snowbound (after ignoring the closing gates) and
thought THEY were the chosen few who could make it...natural selection.

  This is one of nature's  U-CANT-TOUCH-THIS

  Temperature and amount of moisture and stratification all play a role
in what falls out of the clouds...
  -i know this is profound-
  If conditions are right, the stuff can fall like BB's, that is called
GRAUPEL -it's like pelleted snow.  Ice encased pellets.  Gravel water.
  If the rain is real heavy and the upper air mass is cold & windy enough
it become hail.  We get it in all sizes around here, the seasonal cusps
are the worst. Is it gonna rain water or ice balls, put the mattress on
the car, quick!  
  Go ahead, ask me about the Tornadoes! i've met 'em on the turnpike, and
pulled over to let all THREE of them PASS. 
  Kansas aint boring...

There is a German language convention for this.  If you cannot type the
accented vowel (a, o, or u umlaut), follow it instead with an extra e.
For example, "Juergen Barth".

Subject: Re: Racing: Fire extinguishers

Drew,

The PCA Club Racing rules still specify a halon fire extinguisher.  To
find out whether this will change, you should probably get in touch
with Bob Russo.

For region-sponsored events, it's up to the particular region.  We used
to specify only that it be a BC or ABC rated extinguisher of at least
2.5 lb.  We dropped the requirement of an extinguisher last year.

Subject: 944 Turbo oil thermostat

Folks,

Perhaps someone out there has had a similar experience.  I installed
the oil cooling system from a 944 Turbo into my 944S.  Works great,
but what I've noticed recently is that at speed the oil temp runs
too cool.

It appears that the oil thermostat is stuck open.  This conclusion
based on observing that the oil runs cooler with the car at speed,
then runs up to a more sensible temperature in traffic.  I also put
a pyrometer on the oil radiator and found that it was at almost oil
temp.

Has anyone seen this, and if so, what was the cause?  Do the
thermostats themselves fail, or perhaps is it the spring retaining it
in the filter base manifold?

Kevin

As both a Brit and an Arizona resident I can tell you there is plenty of 
black ice her in the winter. - but you have to go to the northern half of 
the State (aprox 6000 ft above sea level) to find it. Arizona is not all 
desert. There are more acres of forest than desert here, and there is snow 
on the ground five months of the year- we have ski resorts you know.

Subject: RE: Replacing Struts "86 951

I'd like to add my two cents to Malcom Smith's excellent procedure 
description (You ought to write for Haynes!).
	 On item 1, I think one would have to be a real contortionist to 
get a spring compressor on a  front spring with the car on the ground. 
There is enough clearance (just barely) under the fender to swing out the 
top of the strut without first compressing the spring. (Of course ya gotta 
jack up the car and take off the tire first.) The spring is then 
MUCH more accessable to get the compressor on it.
	On item 3, finding a 22mm box end wrench with enough offset to 
reach the M14 locknut might be tough. An impact wrench with a 22mm socket 
(a 7/8" works just as well) will get this nut off/on without also having to 

hold the shock piston shaft with the 7mm allen key.
	Since putting in aftermarket springs is a frequently done handling 
upgrade, all 944/951philes who haven't done so already should keep this 
procedure in mind.

Subject: 914-6 DISTRIBUTORS

What is the *HOT* distributor setup for an "autocross/track only" 914-6
with a stock 2.0 engine.  The present unit is a Marelli which I understand
are suspect, even when new.

Automotion's catalog says the stock unit is an 008 which is also the unit
for the '70-'71 911T. I have had heard that there may be a better one but
am unable to get a consensus.  The local Bosch Rep. says that I should try
an 007 for a '69-'71, 911S, but a mechanic friend of mine says that the
advance range on that unit is too narrow for my engine, and that if I'm NOT
going to use the stock unit then I should go with the 006 which is for the
'69-'71, 911E.  This has left me confused as to the advantages of using
anything other that the stock 008.

Any ideas?

Subject: Neophyte Racing questions

I just applied to PCA and got my complimentary edition of Pano (the 993
on the cover looked way cool though I don't know why the license plate
had 928 on it ?).

After a quick read I have a couple of questions on racing/taking my
porsche out to a track.

First I guess I could use some help with some definitions.

What exactly is/are -

Club Racing ?
Auto-Crossing ?
Time-Trialing ?

Pano seemed to indicate that for Club racing you needed roll-cage plus
harness modifications (among other things).  I hope this doesn't mean that
I have to spend a bundle to track prep my car if I want to take it out 
on a track.

Also, Pano had a question to do with the '13/13' rule.  What the heck is
the `13/13' rule ?

Hope these questions aren't too basic.

Can anyone recommend useable side mirrors for a 356 (specifically Speedster)?
I currently have the original mirrors (forgot official name, Aero something,
but the ones with the long narrow chrome stems and sort of oval mirrors) and 
they are horrible as far as adjustment goes.  I currently have them mounted
on my doors (look funny on fenders IMHO) and the right side mirror will not
adjust to the point of being actually useable.  I don't want to get some ugly
black plastic aftermarket mirrors, but I want mirrors that are useable.
Any suggestions?

Subject: 928 flashing dome light problem


  
  Right before I had to put the 928 ('82) to sleep for the winter <sigh> I 
  started to have this interesting problem.  When the car was cold (in the 
  morning, fresh out of the garage), the dome light would flash as I drove 
  down the road, and the 'door ajar' buzzer would buzz.  Often, this would 
  coincide with bumps in the road, and would stop when the car was at rest.
  After a few minutes, it would eventually stop.  I think this was because 
  the car heated up from the sunlight and heater.
  
  When the car is idling and stationary, I've pounded around a bit (a trick 
  I learned from 'Home Improvements' <grunt>) and found the most sensitive 
  part of the car is the area right beneath where the driver door would be 
  if it were closed.  I've tried removing the door-jamb switch and tugging a 
  bit on the wire attached to it, but that does not change the sensitivity 
  or the problem.
  
  Once, it even caused the alarm to go off while the car was stationary and 
  locked (of course, not in a well-lit parking lot or anything... late at 
  night while the leaves were blowing around!)  Since then, I've used the 
  non-arming key to lock the car to prevent *that* from happening again.
  
  I suspect a bare wire or something in that tunnel, bumping a ground, but 
  I can't get to it.  I tried to remove the carpet and plastic bit over the 
  tunnel, but all I see under it is the top metal part of the tunnel, and 
  it doesn't seem to de-attach from anything.
  
  Any ideas regarding causes or how-to-find-it advice?
  
  Thanks.

Boy, good question.  I either got it through the shop or perhaps from
some PCA region's goodie store.  Perhaps it was the NNJR PX, and perhaps
someone on the list has a phone number for them.  Wurth wants a minimum
order of like $40.  (I've been trying to get our region's goodie store
to carry Wurth products, but they're really just interested in boutique

Btw, the Wurth HHS 2000 lubricant is wonderful for door hinges and

Subject: 356 Tire Question

Regarding Stan's recent query for decent skinny tires for older 
cars:

I have a '67 912 that has the original 4.5" 1967 optional Fuchs 
alloys, so we share a simlilar quest for decent tires.

I used to run 185/70 Michelin XWX - which I understand was THE 
trick "soft" compound autocross tire a decade back.  I found 
them to be horrible - extremely stiff sidewalls full of bead 
filler, harsh riding, with unpredicatable breakaway 
characteristics and wicked wet-surface handling.  Also very 
expensive, and almost impossible to find today.  But they 
looked so RIGHT on an early 911/912...

I'm currently happily running Yokohama A-321vr's in 185/70 VR 
size/rating, and I'm very pleased.  The grip is every bit as 
good as an age-hardened XWX, even though they have a treadwear 
rating of 200.  They have flexible, quiet-riding sidewalls, and 
what appears to be nice, stiff tread.  The tread pattern is 
similar to (but not a copy of) the Pirelli P6.  But, unlike the 
P6, this is a modern, two-ply sidewall tire. 

This tire is not very common -- I got mine from Roger Kraus 
tires, a racing tire shop well-known in the SF Bay Area.  Based 
on the selection of sizes (all high aspect ratio) and VR 
rating, the tire appears to be designed for older European 
luxury/performance cars, such as Jaguars.  The modern 
construction is a really an improvement over my previous 
retro-tire experiment.  

You probably won't set any lap records with these tires, 
though.  Of course, for autocross I use fatter/lower A008RS's 
or Comp TA R1's on 6-inch wheels.  And usually win :)   But for 
street driving, I prefer the greater ground clearance, higher 
gearing, wet surface grip, and ride comfort of the A-321vr's.

Thanks for the great list.  - Eric Nichols

That's a 6mm or a 8mm bolt?

Anyway this works for me;(sometimes)

if there is a small piece of the
bolt-extractor outside the block, use a MIG/MAG welder and weld something to
attach the bolt.The heat from the welder will in 95% of the cases
lossen the bolt.The only thing you need to do then is to get a hold on
whatever you attached to the bolt-extractor.(Often I've welded Umbraco(Hex?)
keys to broken bolts,then you'll get some leverage too.

If no piece of the bolt sticks out,(the most common problem) you
better drill it out.Not easy,even worse when your extractor is stuck
into it.

For the future remember to heat bolts that seem to be seized,*Before*
you try loosing them.Use a propane heater or anything that don't make
too much heat.

good luck woth your bolt removal,

Subject: Re:  911/2 Trailing Arm Bushing Squeak

More on the subject of squeaky plastic bushings -

Recent postings have decried the lack of availability of the 
factory spring-plate (trailing arm) bushings.  I have a NOS 
set, purchased from Stoddard about four years ago for my '67 
912.  You may be wondering why I'm not using them...

While installing them, I noticed that they seemed softer than 
the old, worn bonded-rubber bushings that I meticulously carved 
off the spring plates.  I assumed that was due to the 
difference in age.  Hmmmm.

After reinstalling the rear suspension, setting the ride height 
(no alignment yet), and taking my beauty out for a spin, 
imagine my surprise when the car seemed to actually have a 
harsher ride - MUCH harsher than I'd remembered.  Further 
inspection revealed that the rubber douhgnuts were so soft that 
they had compressed to the point that the spring plate shaft 
was RESTING on the bushing cover plate, i.e., METAL to METAL! I 
might as well have installed Heim-joints from a 935!

Needless to say, out came the "OEM" parts and in went the 
well-known Poly-Graphite plastic bushings, in street-hardness 
(they come in two hardnesses, BTW).  I like them, they don't 
seem too harsh or noisy, the handling of the car is more 
precise, and they've never squeaked.  I think the secret to 
eliminating the squeak is to fastidiously clean the spring 
plates of all traces of the former vulcanized rubber bushings, 
and use a good grease.  I used Swepco Moly-grease.  Remember 
that the area where the rubber was bonded is now the 
bearing/rotation surface.

Moral of the story:  If you really want rubber, try and find 
new OEM spring plates with the vulcanized rubber bushings 
attached.  

While on the subject of spring plates:  I have a set of 
Sway-Away adjustable spring plates, but I haven't had the nerve 
to install them because of what seems to be excessive play 
between the bores of the two plate halves:  about .020".  Seems 
like this would allow undesirable movement and resulting toe-in 
changes while driving.  It seems like they could be shimmed to 
fill in the gap.  Have any of you racer types noticed this?  Or 
am I just being too anal?

Griot't Garage, a mail order company out of California, has Wurth
products. (Richard Griot also has a '72 911-S, so you can ask him
what he uses on his suspension bushings)

They also have a non-Wurth product called "Electrical Gremlin Spray"
that is supposed to clean contacts and leave a blue lubricant in 
place. I don't have any personal experience with it, though.

Their phone number is 800-345-5789 and they have really nice tools
and car related goodies.

A friend of mine uses Wurth HHS 2000 on his 911 bushings and says
it works great. I've never used it on bushings, but after he rode
in my car a couple of times, my steering column was squeeking and
driving him nuts. (I had grown immune to the sound) We took the 
steering wheel off and sprayed some HHS 2000 down around the 
bushing/bearings and it's been quiet ever since.

77 911 keys don't have a different "code" for master vs. valet, they are just
the same cut on two different blanks.  Most locksmiths carry only the master
blank, so if you don't mind starting your prize with a noname generic part, 
just have your red valet key dupped.  Dealer price for the key blanks will
astound you (at least if you remember when it cost $.35 to have a new house-

better a $7.00 key than a $50 tie.

The acid idea is actually really good - wish I'd thought of it years ago
when I did this same trick to an exhaust stud on my Bug. Just make sure that
none of it gets anywhere else (like inside the engine).

You should forget about drilling out the broken screw extractor - it's
a good bit harder than the drill bits available from a common hardware
store. I went through 5 cobalt bits and only succeeded in breaking the
hardened metal into smaller pieces, at least one of which is probably still
embedded in the aluminum of the head. I now have a set of high-strength
dental probes and scrapers that I would try to use to dislodge the
extractor fragment. Maybe try to drill a small-diameter hole beside the
broken off "EZ-Snap", so you can get a suitable probe hooked around behind it
and pull it free. Or come up with diamond-tipped drill bits - the cobalt
ones are not going to cut it.

Then, once you get the hardened tool fragments out, see if you can find a
reducing stud. I was able to obtain a supply of 10mm to 8mm reducing studs
(Mike Kohlbrenner had one, with the appropriate tap which we proceded to
trash against the EZ-out fragment that "never came out", and I found a
few more at an auto parts place in Milford that "used to do a lot of
Bug stuff"). These are really nice - you drill out the hole to 9mm, then
run the 10mm tap through it, screw in the 10mm side of the reducing stud,
and voila, a nice 8mm stud sticking out. Be very careful about centering the
drill and drilling very straight. The stud was drive home by putting a pair
of 8mm id nuts on it, locking them together, and using the outer one as if
it were a bolt head. If 8mm is what you need for the 928 water pump, let me
know, I still have a couple of these studs in the toolbox.

Subject: RE: Replacing Struts '86 951

I'd like to add my two cents to Malcom Smith's excellent procedure 
description (You ought to write for Hayes!).
	 On item 1, I think one would have to be a real contortionist to 
get a spring compressor on a  front spring with the car on the ground. 
There is enough clearance (just barely) under the fender to swing out the 
top of the strut without first compressing the spring. The spring is then 
MUCH more accessable to get the compressor on it.
	On item 3, finding a 22mm box end wrench with enough offset to 
reach the M14 locknut might be tough. An impact wrench with a 22mm socket 
(a 7/8" works just as well) will get this nut off/on without also having to 
hold the shock piston shaft with the 7mm allen key.
	Since putting in aftermarket springs is a frequently done handling 
upgrade, all 944/951philes who haven't done so already should keep this 
procedure in mind.

Since I live in the Northeast that was an untenable situation, and this fall I

We just had our first snowstorm and I can't begin to describe the

i talked to Kurt Weiss about the new rules last night; Kurt is on
the IT advisory committee and is also a prominent (and very good)
local cage builder, as well as an engineer for GE.  what
follows is a summary of what i got out of the conversation. 

evidently the new rules were prompted by the Showroom Stock rollover
accident at the runoffs involving an MX-3.  the MX-3 was equipped
with an Autopower bolt in roll cage.  the MX-3 is also distinguished
by the fact that the cage was somewhat elipsoid in shape, to follow
the contours of the car closely.  Autopower cages are made with
ERW tubing with walls of 0.120 thickness.  the cage failed because
the verticals of the main hoop bent as did the diagonal brace.  the
ERW tubing did not split at its seam in the accident.

Kurt feels that the new rule about 4 bends max in the main hoop
is a good one; he's always built cages that way.  he feels that
added tube wall thickness would not have prevented the failure; thicker
tube walls do not significantly alter the resistance to bending.
he would prefer to see that a horizontal cross bar be mandated
in the main hoop, which would function in tension to resist any
spreading of the main hoop.  in particular, he says (in agreement
with calvin sanders) that 0.120 DOM tubing for AS cars will double
the materials cost for an AS cage.

Subject: CO meters for 914 FI recal

Hello,
     I am interested in getting feedback from the net with respect to
CO analyzers. There is a unit advertised in the Pano Classifieds for
a unit called a Gastester ($125 - analog, $225 - digital) sold by
John Abbot. Has anyone had experience with this or other low priced
analyzers?
     My application is to recalibrate the FI on my 1972 914 motor
rebuilt to 1.9L. I would like to reset the pressure transducer to give
aprox. 4% CO at idle and then run the car under load and fine tune it.
I don't really need a high quality (ie $$) meter, just one for
occasional use.
     Also, if anyone out there has done a similar rebuild, I'd be
interested to know about your experience. Mine will have the 1.8L
96mm NPR kit (8/1 comp), 1.7L head rebuilt to 1.8 specs, and a stock
cam. It's going together this weekend!

Hi, Stan.
 
Just a footnote to the message I mistakenly posted privately yesterday.
Clark Anderson also performs a procedure called "boxing" the front trailing
arms to reduce flexing. I haven't had this done but the racers say it makes
a big difference. The procedure is to weld a U-channel to the trailing arm
to stiffen it.
 
Again, Clark Anderson does the front decambering. He can be reached at
408-269-9550. He's the brother of Bruce Anderson who writes for Excellence
and Pano. Tell Clark I sentchuz.
 
The cost of the decambering is very nominal, but I don't remember the cost
as it was done 3 years ago. He can do your arms or sell you fresh ones.
 
Regards,
 
Pete

I have used the acid idea, it was the only thing that worked.  Its
been a long time but someone actually sells an acid kit that comes
with a small block of clay and two bottles of acid that you mix
together, specifically for eating away steel fasteners in aluninum.  
I just can't remember who sells it.  I would try some specialty machine
shops.

Hi, Jim.
 
Well, you've really done it now. It's probably stuck thanks to anodic
corrosion between the steel stud and aluminum cover.
 
Hmm... I don't know if I like the idea of putting anything caustic on there.
It may work, but if it doesn't, you're looking at more expense.
 
The right way to do it is to have the stud electrically discharge milled
out. (EDM). Look in the phone book for tap and stud removal, or call some
machine shops to see who they use. It's not expensive, but you may have to
take the work to them (tow the car?). I have had this done on occasion, and
the cost is about $20 to $25 per hole. The old stud is completely removed,
without touching the aluminum. The threads are perfectly good afterwards.
The more drilling and such you're going to do, the more likely you are to
cut into the aluminum instead of just taking out the stud. Also you have a
hardened tap extractor stuck in there. That will NOT drill out. You would
have to grind it -- or EDM it -- if it doesn't come out easily by itself. I
don't think pounding anything in deeper is going to work either. Do the EDM,
learn about a different technique, and save yourself a lot of grief. Even if
you have to rent one of those little U-Haul car dollies (holds front or rear
wheels only) you're still way ahead.

Quite often on some kinds of snow and ice you can actually accelerate faster 
with some wheelspin than with the damn TC chattering away not letting the 
wheels turn.

>It doesn't have a switch for shutting the ABS off, though, does it?

No you can't shut the ABS off.  A funny thing did happen to me - I left the 
Vision for an oil change and when I went to pick it up the Service Manager 
said he was ordering new front pads for me as he didn't like the sound that 
they made under light pressure after a stop - sort of a groaning sound.  The 
pads were installed several days later and I headed down the long hill to 
downtown Duluth and discovered I had no front brakes and no ABS.  Returned the 
car to the dealer swearing at the idiot who had test driven the vehicle after 
the pads were installed for not discovering this problem.  It took the shop 
three days to diagnose the problem which was that the ABS/TC was damaged 
during the pad installation requiring a new ABS system which corrected the 
problem.  

Anybody have any ideas what might have happened?

I don't think they really knew what they did, just that a complete replacement 
was the solution.

  Yes, not only have i heard of it- we have it several times a year!

  It happens when the temperature drops below freezing while a gentle
rain occurs.  Its weird because the stuff is frozen solid and bounces
off the windscreen, leaving it dry and offering no clue to its presence.
  This usually happens at night and starts with dry roads.  The temps
drop enough but may not actually go below freezing, at higher altitude,
the particles freeze then drop thru to the warmer air near ground and
thaw just enough to 'powder coat' the tarmac.  The coating is CLEAR
and slick as oily marbles.  The tarmac shows thru this coating as
BLACK road surface, fooling the eye into thinking the road is clear and
dry...until you hit your brakes or go to accelerate.
  I had a terrifying
trip to Denver going west on I-70.  Driving an old ford van with a trailer
load of hardware, went for about 30 miles wondering what was wrong with
the road.  When i went to slow for a stop -i nearly jackknifed, after i got
stopped, i fell on my keester when i got out.  You actually have to get
out and feel the road surface with your hand.  I put chains on my rear
wheels and drove no more than 35mph from Goodland to just outside Denver.
 The chains helped very little, the weight of my truck is what saved me.
  It was like slaloming, and my trailer helped keep me on a straight course.

  Since then, I DREAD commuting on I-70 during winter. That stretch
between the Kansas border and Denver can get deadly.
  Every year a story of how some poor souls DIED in their cars (4X4 jeeps
too) because they got snowbound (after ignoring the closing gates) and
thought THEY were the chosen few who could make it...natural selection.

  This is one of nature's  U-CANT-TOUCH-THIS

  Temperature and amount of moisture and stratification all play a role
in what falls out of the clouds...
  -i know this is profound-
  If conditions are right, the stuff can fall like BB's, that is called
GRAUPEL -it's like pelleted snow.  Ice encased pellets.  Gravel water.
  If the rain is real heavy and the upper air mass is cold & windy enough
it become hail.  We get it in all sizes around here, the seasonal cusps
are the worst. Is it gonna rain water or ice balls, put the mattress on
the car, quick!  
  Go ahead, ask me about the Tornadoes! i've met 'em on the turnpike, and
pulled over to let all THREE of them PASS.

There is a German language convention for this.  If you cannot type the

Drew,

The PCA Club Racing rules still specify a halon fire extinguisher.  To
find out whether this will change, you should probably get in touch
with Bob Russo.

For region-sponsored events, it's up to the particular region.  We used
to specify only that it be a BC or ABC rated extinguisher of at least
2.5 lb.  We dropped the requirement of an extinguisher last year.

Subject: 944 Turbo oil thermostat

Folks,

Perhaps someone out there has had a similar experience.  I installed
the oil cooling system from a 944 Turbo into my 944S.  Works great,
but what I've noticed recently is that at speed the oil temp runs
too cool.

It appears that the oil thermostat is stuck open.  This conclusion
based on observing that the oil runs cooler with the car at speed,
then runs up to a more sensible temperature in traffic.  I also put
a pyrometer on the oil radiator and found that it was at almost oil
temp.

Has anyone seen this, and if so, what was the cause?  Do the
thermostats themselves fail, or perhaps is it the spring retaining it
in the filter base manifold?

As both a Brit and an Arizona resident I can tell you there is plenty of

Subject: RE: Replacing Struts "86 951

I'd like to add my two cents to Malcom Smith's excellent procedure 
description (You ought to write for Haynes!).
	 On item 1, I think one would have to be a real contortionist to 
get a spring compressor on a  front spring with the car on the ground. 
There is enough clearance (just barely) under the fender to swing out the 
top of the strut without first compressing the spring. (Of course ya gotta 
jack up the car and take off the tire first.) The spring is then 
MUCH more accessable to get the compressor on it.
	On item 3, finding a 22mm box end wrench with enough offset to 
reach the M14 locknut might be tough. An impact wrench with a 22mm socket 
(a 7/8" works just as well) will get this nut off/on without also having to 

hold the shock piston shaft with the 7mm allen key.
	Since putting in aftermarket springs is a frequently done handling 
upgrade, all 944/951philes who haven't done so already should keep this 
procedure in mind.

Subject: 356 Tire Question

Regarding Stan's recent query for decent skinny tires for older 
cars:

I have a '67 912 that has the original 4.5" 1967 optional Fuchs 
alloys, so we share a simlilar quest for decent tires.

I used to run 185/70 Michelin XWX - which I understand was THE 
trick "soft" compound autocross tire a decade back.  I found 
them to be horrible - extremely stiff sidewalls full of bead 
filler, harsh riding, with unpredicatable breakaway 
characteristics and wicked wet-surface handling.  Also very 
expensive, and almost impossible to find today.  But they 
looked so RIGHT on an early 911/912...

I'm currently happily running Yokohama A-321vr's in 185/70 VR 
size/rating, and I'm very pleased.  The grip is every bit as 
good as an age-hardened XWX, even though they have a treadwear 
rating of 200.  They have flexible, quiet-riding sidewalls, and 
what appears to be nice, stiff tread.  The tread pattern is 
similar to (but not a copy of) the Pirelli P6.  But, unlike the 
P6, this is a modern, two-ply sidewall tire. 

This tire is not very common -- I got mine from Roger Kraus 
tires, a racing tire shop well-known in the SF B

Subject: Further comments re: 3.0 SC

Recommend valve job and replace guides on factory original engines over 65 to
70K miles. You can probably grind your valves (taper on intake stems should
be acceptable at 75K).  Realize that many engines w/ this mileage are NOT
factory original because they had a chain tensioner fail at some point, thus
a competent shop and prudent owner would have upgraded during the bent valve
repair!

Your engine PROBABLY has Nikasil barrels, thus P/C life will be basically
forever.  You can shave .030" from combustion chamber (and like amount from
chain housings) and take out about 4cc out; this will give you about 8.7:1
REAL compression.

Someone else jumped into this discussion with his situation ('72 911 w/ '78
3.0 engine and early exhaust). Questioned lack of low end torque and possible
alteration of cam timing.  "Lack" of torque is somewhat illusionary. You have
low compression coupled with a large intake tract.  It takes RPM's to get the
air moving into the engine. Increasing the compression does wonders.  That's
why the factory went back to 2.7 size intake and raised the compression in
'80 (note that they rated the engine the same).  Also, on CIS engines there
is almost no difference between the min., max. and preferred points for cam
timing.

Aftermarket muffler only (and take out converter) works pretty well, best
upgrade is good used early heat exchangers, or SSI (to my knowledge John
doesn't make a muffler), plus a muffler. (Haven't seen B&B's exchangers in
person yet, probably good too.)

I have been running a stock muffler on my car (9.8:1 "euro"  p/c, large port,
early exhaust, 7:31 ring/pinion) and it's a little weak above 6500. It can
still stay ahead of stock 3.6 Carrera 2's through 4th gear. I put on a Bursch
I had laying around last week; there is a difference! 

The one track event I ran last year (Phoenix Int'l in Oct.), an RS America (a
PCA Club Racing winner) pulled me about 3-4 car lengths from turn 4 apex to
turn 1 braking point (acceleration from about 105 mph to 125 mph). That car
is somewhat modified (After that event, he put a Zytek FI system with custom
6 butterfly intake!!!  The owner admits to 300+ h.p.!!).

Force Racing synchros...look in Panorama (someone post the number?)...never
used them, but I don't think they sell over the counter.  

A WORD OF CAUTION TO ALL:  the factory spends A LOT of time and effort
figuring out how to build these cars. DO NOT think that  aftermarket
solutions will ALWAYS bring increased reliability or driving enjoyment!

Again, what a nice surprise to get all this email!

Subject: 924 -- what to look out for?

A couple of weeks ago, I had asked about a colleague's 924 -- I received
some helpful mail from John Wise, Thomas Edward Birchard and James Fry.
Thank you gentlemen.

I didn't manage to see the car then as I had a bad bout of flu.  Now that
I've cleared my body of antihistamines, I'll be taking a look at the car
this weekend.  I'd appreciate any more tips on what to look out for eg
belts (BTW does the 924 use timing belts?), gotchas/things which omitted
would either be irritation, catastrophic, or just big bux.

On another note, are the parts interchangable with VW/Audi?  If so, which
are the equivalent VW/Audi cars/engines most commonly used?  I guess the
real question is parts availability (don't want to line the dealer's
pockets).  

Also, how easy is it to work on the engine and body?


I'll be taking a look at the service records too.  BTW, the car is a 1980.  

Many thanks in advance

    Ken,

    Thanks for posting your comments re 3.0 rebuild.  A couple of
    quick questions concerning same.

    1- When you have shaved off .030" from the combustion chamber and
    chain housing to increase combustion, does the
    alteration also put more slack in the timing chain?  If yes, is it
    negligible or does something also need to be done about the
    chains?  Can the chain tensioners take up that much slack and
    still be effective across their intended useful range?

    2-  I have heard some negatives about the OEM 3.2 rod bolts, and
    have seen advertised in Pano suppossedly bullet-proof bolts for
    the 3.2, as well as other motors.  Have there been any problems
    with the OEM rod bolts for the 3.0?

    Thanks in advance for your feedback.

Snake Oil!
Is That Additive Really A Negative?
Article and Photos by Fred Rau
ROAD RIDER/August 1992/Pg 15

   Information for this article was compiled from reports and studies by 
the University of Nevada Desert Research Center, DuPont Chemical Company,

Above is an excerpt from a lengthy article discussing the pros and cons of 
various engine additives containing PTFE (e.g. Slick 50) and zinc compounds.  
Now that one of my burning questions "Whether or not to add Slick 50 to my 
Porsche or Audi?" has been answered by an unequivocal 'NO!', I wonder if 
anyone else is interested in reading this lengthy posting (42K)?  
If so, drop me a line so I don't clutter the entire list....

Summarizing, the key points are:
PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene aka Teflon, a DuPont trademark) is a solid 
powder suspended in various weights of engine oil sold under various brand 
names.  Since PTFE supposedly sticks to moving parts with higher 
pressures/friction, it will also stick in passages with lower friction.  This 
may result in a clogged oil filter, damming of critical passages and resulting 
oil starvation.

Subject: lifespan of 911 3.0SC engines???

There have been several posts pertaining to the durability of
3.0SC engines - 200-300K mi have been reported as routine by
several sources here.  There have now been a couple of posts
indicating the need to redo the top end (valve guides) at 65 to
75K mi.  What is the story here??  Seems to me that the top end
should last significantly longer.  Is this a function of air
cooled engines not really getting enough air to the head??  I
know older engines designed for leaded gas will need valve work
sooner as a result of the switch to unleaded - I was under the
impression all SC's were designed for unleaded. 

Anyone care to enlighten me?

I believe that the 3.2 rod bolts were downsized 1mm from the 3.0.

I suspect to reduce rotating weight.

I hear they are mainly prone to fail at sustained high (engine) speeds.

I don't know where your friend is located, but if it's in the bay area
I can recommend a very good upholstery shop that will do quality
work at a reasonable price: Sid's Upholstery, 1917 Old MIddlefield Rd,
Mtn. View (408-255-9191, owner is "Hugo").

I have used them for a variety of work (cabriolet top and front seats
in 911's) and have been extremely pleased.  Sid's is a very well known
shop, always busy on interior restoration of expensive foreign classics.
I would say their prices are definitely not bargain basement but a nice
compromise for the quality of the work.  I had the leather replaced on
two seats (upper and lower sections) as well as some side panels for
about $300.  Fit and color matching were very impressive.

Someone on the wire had questions regarding the location of the 
automatic transmission shift lever in the Taurus SHO.  It is a floor 
shift machine.  In fact, the magazines love the slushbox version 
because of two main reasons:  the standard manual transmission is very 
noisy, and the automatic's get a 3.2 liter version of the Yamaha 24 
Valve motor, where as the stick shifters have the 3.0 liter.  This 
compensates for any performance loss through the automatic and makes 
the car a much more enjoyable commuter car.

I think the 200-300K estimates are generally referring to bottom end
longevity. The top end, barring any major catastrophe, will require
overhaul before that mileage. It depends on how far you want to go
with preventative maintenance. Yes do a valve job at 65K and you'll
never be stuck on the side of the road, but I know of half a dozen
SC's driving around with more than double that mileage with good
leakdown. I don't think there is a definative answer to this question,
it depends on your philosphy and how much priority you give to your
car over other things you need, like a new dining room set or having
that roof leak fixed on your house. :)

Hey there netters. I saw the question about the 951 clutch (88 K miles and when
should I worry) and thought I'd put my two cents in. I have  110 K on my
original clutch (although they're mostly highway miles still a monumental sum).
I was concern at one point that it might be time for a replacement so I took my
car to the local dealer to have it checked. When checked they told me they
could not get it to slip so they advised me to continue to drive on it until it
showed signs of slippage. Although it still doesn't show signs of slippage, I
have noticed that the depression/engage distance has increased (maybe some
experts out there could comment) and also at one time it made a whizzing sound
when depressed (possibly the release bearing or gremlins). The sound is now
gone except on very cold mornings (about 30 degrees here in the bay area).

Yup, had it with my VW.  Add examining your Oxygen sensor communication loop.

An intermittant connection can cause cycling into/out of the default
air/fuel mix setting ("limp home" - a rich setting).  As the system turns
itself on and off, the mix changes very rapidly, resulting it being wrong
on a PER CYLINDER basis (it's either too rich or too lean when system
overcompensates as it comes back on).  But if you measure air:fuel ratio,
it looks OK - and that's why its tricky to detect.  Resonation can make
it look like a bad injector...but then it would MOVE to another injector!

Note that this intermittant electrical break can be the O2 sensor, but it
can also be IN THE WIRING HARNESS.  Try wiggling wires when it's hooked up
to the expensive diagnostic gear - that's how they finally found mine.

I can't help with the valve guide question, other than to note that
just about every 911 head I've ever seen sitting on the bench has
needed valve guides. Oooops. Now I've done it -- one of the corallaries
of Murphy's law says that if you don't know about a mechanical problem you 
can drive the car forever without it byting you, but if you *do* know,
then you're dead meat...

The real reason I jumped in here is to note that even the older
Porsches *need nothing special done to run on unleaded.* This is
a Big Myth, based on mis-application of info specific to Detroit Iron
to our four-wheeled friends from the fatherland...

Even back in the '70s, there was an article in Pano, reprinted in 
UpFixin' volume 4 or 5 I think, that cites the issues. Basicly,
if the valve seat doesn't have a Rockwell hardness of at least
58, you *NEED* the tetraethyllead to keep from seeing seat precession
as the valve continually slams into the seat. *ALL* Porsches have
hardened seats, even the old Pre-A's had seats in the mid-60s on the
Rockwell scale.

Same applies to BMW motorcycles, too. Even though there's a *BOOMING* 
business out there selling hardened seats and stainless steel valves

a similar head design, you also have hardend seats, but there *is*
a special "unleaded head" which has a differently shaped combustion

Subject: Found a Carrera, what do you think?



	I found an 84 Carrera with a new targa top and seals, it has 215k miles
and has had a tranny rebuilt in the last year. It had a small dent on the rear 
right fender that had been fixed. It just got into a small accident and the
owner will fix it(small dent in the hood and replace headlite ring). Original
lady owner, red, leather option, new tires, most records since new. It looks
to me and a friend of mine(who owns one like it) to be a good deal at 13-14k.
Any input will be appreciated!!!

The wiper wiring is pretty self-contained in its harness, and connects 
to the wiper switch by plugging in from the back (dashboard) side.  
Yes, it does sound like you've got a short or other problem in the 
connector, or possibly within the switch.

It's a straight-forward job to pull the wheel and then the switch-pack 
layers.  Regular screwdrivers suffice once the wheel's off.

Subject: Einstein and clocks

Hello,

Many of you are familar with the concept of a clock moving at a high
velocity running slowly.  Well, I think I have discovered a discrepancy
in the theory.  When the 944 is running, the clock is fine.  When parked,
it runs slowly.  Very slowly.  I have been told that the reason is
because the slight voltage drop while parked is enough for an antique
clock to have troubles (by Paul).  So, is there a fix, other than getting
a replacement?  (NO, I'm not going to drive it all the time to keep
the clock running on schedule).  If a replacement is necessary, where is a
good, reliable place to find one?  Oh, the car is an '84, and if the dash
has to come apart, forget it.  I have a dashboard mystery on the 914 I'm
fiddling with this week.  (Yes, the 914 is dry again!)

Hi gang,

I noticed that there was a discussion going on about 944 clutches (no, I'm
not completely out of it, just that spring fever has hit) and just wanted
to add that our 944 has 130k miles on the original clutch.  Fifth or sixth
slave cylinder (don't yell, Kevin :) ).  The clutch has wandered around
since the car was new (Paul is the original owner) and no Porsche doctor
can find a thing wrong with it.  The slave cylinder went bad the last
time a few months ago because a mechanic adjusted the clutch to negative
free-play.  Unfortunately, Porsche doesn't feel that the slave cylinder
is expensive enough to carry rebuild parts (at least at Carlsen) so we
end up buying the whole cylinder.  Still cheaper than Leland :)

Someone on the wire had questions regarding the location of the 
automatic transmission shift lever in the Taurus SHO.  It is a floor 
shift machine.  In fact, the magazines love the slushbox version 
because of two main reasons:  the standard manual transmission is very 
noisy, and the automatic's get a 3.2 liter version of the Yamaha 24 
Valve motor, where as the stick shifters have the 3.0 liter.  This 
compensates for any performance loss through the automatic and makes 
the car a much more enjoyable commuter car.

In answer to the two postings on this...

Ronnie, dunno what you or your shop means by "get it to slip."  Do you
mean slip as in normal shifting, esp. getting the car rolling?  Or slip
as in not binding correctly under load?

There were a couple updates to the clutch, as I recall.  One supplemented
the riveting of the friction material to the drive plate with some
sort of adhesive.  I think this was mostly only a problem for autocrossers
and folks who pushed a little hard on the equipment.

The other change had to do with making the t/o bearing ID a fraction of
a millimeter larger so that it would move more freely.  They also did
something to make the pedal effort less, I suspect some change to the
pressure plate design.  None of these changes were critical, and if
your clutch works fine, be happy.

With regard to increased pedal travel, I'd start by have the clutch
hydraulics pressure bled, and I'd check the master a slave cylinders for
any obvious signs of leaking.

944 clutches are nice in that you can check drive plate thickness and
release lever travel through the inspection port on the clutch bell
housing.  Do both (or have someone do it); procedure and spec is described
in the workshop manual.

Regarding the whirring noise, 944 transmissions are prone to making
such odd noises, esp. when you're in neutral with the clutch engaged
(ie, foot off the pedal).

And, of course, if it ain't busted, don't fix it.  Even at 80K miles!

This is ridiculous.  I just saw one last weekend at the Detroit Auto Show, and
we commented on where the brake lite was, and now I'm not sure.  Something
tells me it was integrated into the spoiler...sort of like Cadillac does on
some of their models.  In any event, it looked ok...not like it was pasted on

At the Detroit auto show both the cab. and the coupe had the basket
handle third brake light. The light itself is pretty wide, similar to
the light on the Seville. I think it looks better than the "periscope"
third brake light previously used on cabs.  

Other show highlights include a bright purple 968 cab and a 911 turbo
slantnose with exposed popup headlights (ala 928).  No Porsche
prototyps or show cars.

A good quality '84 mechanical clock, as in Porsches, will not slow down 
(much) regardless of temperature or voltage.  The accuracy will change 
slightly but that's about it.  Only extreme cases (-50F or 6VDC) will 
the clock lose its composure!  But, ten years of dirt and no 
lubrication may be playing a game here.

Try opening the clock (requires non-standard efforts on the case: "no 
user servicable parts inside" and all that) and using compressed air 
(lungs) to blow it clean, then sparingly lubricate key gears with low 
viscosity fluid (WD40, etc.).

I know some old clocks are not as good as new quartz electronic ones, 
but your 944 doesn't have one of those.  The electronics, if not 
damaged, will always keep time properly - it's the mechanical parts 
that jam up and increase friction to the point that the little motor's 
torque isn't enough!

If a difference of 1-2 volts really upsets the clock, then it's 
internals are hosed and it's time for a new one (sorry!).

The clock comes out fairly easily after removing some trim and a couple 
screws on the plastic panel.  Not too bad, really.

There are 2 groupings at track events.  The first is by driver/car, which looks at
the lap times that you generate.  This grouping is used for the "drivers ed"
portion of the day/weekend.  This tries to ensure that in each of the different
20 minute run groups (usually 4 or 5), that the drivers on the track at any one time,
fall within a reasonable
range of ability and you don't have fast drivers crawling up the back end
of the slower drivers.

The second grouping (for regions that offer timed records at track events)
is by car class...year, model, modification.  This classification
is used in areas where actual time trials finish up the track event, and is used, like
in autocross to recognize the fastest times per category.  For the time trial, 4 to 5
cars are let out on the track at once, spaced so that in the 3 laps, you won't be
impeded by the car in front of you.  Official times are recorded and posted and
some sort of trophies are presented for the top drivers in each class.

Subject:  Identifying 911 Cylinder/Piston types?



While tearing down my 911 engine, I've gotten somewhat confused about
exactly *which* cylinder/piston combination is in it.  It's an early
2.4L engine(1972) but has been rebuilt in the past.  Since the engine
doesn't match the car I have no confidence about what is installed.
Browsing Bruce Andersons Performance book hasn't been too much help.

If you can help the Cylinders are Mahle with the marking 84ZD3. The
sleeve has a 6 in the triangle.  The pistons (Haven't taken them out
yet) do have indentations for the valves so I thought they may be for
an E or S.   

This of course leads to my confusion since I thought this was a T
engine.  

On another topic has anyone bought the rebuild kits from Engine 
Builders supply?  Do they use quality parts, or try to sleeze in 
cheap clones?

Steve, I too have been looking for mirrors for my Speedster, which is a Vintage

marginal as far as visibility goes.  Some racers use the newly manufactured
Raydots, which are ok, look authentic, but aren't the easiest to adjust, and 
don't give you the kind of view modern cars have.  Tweeks and Automotion carry

Pete,
  Which region are you from?  Sounds like a good grouping method you use.
We don't do time trials anymore, interest dropped off a few years ago plus
it cut into the track time for those not interested that aspect of it.
  Our run groups are pretty simple, 5 of them and your placement is based on
previous experience and ability.  No official lap times involved, in fact,
in accordence with National's desire, we strongly request that stop watches
not be used at all.  If someone seems to be in over their head or being held
up than they are moved accordingly.  The car you drive has no impact on
placement from our perspective.  It may have some impact where you end up
based on horsepower limiting or aiding your go fast ability in the lower run
groups but overall skill is the determining factor.

A fax of a sales brochure from PAG and statement from Porsche Canada to
its dealers showed this "grab bar" on a Cab but the statement advises
that this change was effective  with January production on both coupe

When I first saw the picture I felt a more awkward solution to  a silly

Many thanks to those who helped by supplying info on replacing the left cam
tower oil line on my 87 911. As several people stated removal of the
distributer was not necessary but I took it out anyway just to make it easier
to clean this area of the engine - it was simple. Do any of you who have
replaced oil lines on these engines know what the procedure is for replacing
the right hand cam tower line? It looks like the AC mounting bracket must be
removed to get to the block and tensioner connections. Is this true and if so
what is involved in removing this bracket? I removed the AC compressor but the
bracket is still in the way. It looks like I might have to remove part of the
exhaust to get this bracket out - it this correct?
Also, all of this has me obsessed with closing all the oil leaks on this
engine. The only remaining leak is at the bottom of the oil cooler at the front
of the engine. It seems to be primarily the bottom where the line from the oil
tank feeds the engine. Anyone know what is involved in replacing the seals.
Haynes talks about this but gives it about three lines explaining how to do it
if the engine is out of the car. Anyone got a set of factory service manuals
for sale?

Subject: 914: It's alive!

So THAT's what a running 914 sounds like!

It only took a few months, but I seem to have beaten the fuel injection system
(Bosch L-Jetronic) on my 1.8L 914 into submission.

The problem:
  - When it was cold I couldn't even try to speed the engine up by opening the
    throttle. It would stall.
  - When it was warm it was very reluctant to respond to an opening of the
    throttle (non-turbo lag :-)

I tried:
  - replacing all of the hoses to cure any vacuum leaks.
  - checking all of the voltages, pressures and resistances I could find
     - Everything looked good except that the resistance readings that I got
       from the potentiometer connected to the air flow sensor was really
       erratic when the flap was moved from full close to full open. It wasn't
       a smooth increase as I expected.
  - "helping" the air flow sensor flap to open when I revved the engine (I
    pulled the cover off the sensor a couple of months back).
     - This kinda said that the air flow sensor flap wasn't opening enough
       which ment that the brain wasn't squirting enough gas which was causing
       the two problems. Makes sense to me.
  - replacing the o-ring and flat rubber washer on the oil filler cap, and the
    rectangular cork seal on the bottom of the oil filler "assembly" where it
    mounts to the engine block.
     - Don't forget these! I think this is where my vacuum leak was. All of the
       new hoses didn't help. Any leak in this area will allow air into the
       system right before the throttle valve thus bypassing the air flow
       sensor.

The cure(s):
  - Replacing the oil filler seal, washer and o-ring definitely cured the cold
    engine stalling problem. It started and ran quite strongly -- instantly
    (after pumping up the battery a bit :-).
  - It still had its non-turbo lag.
     - Noticing that "helping" the air flow sensor flap to open (i.e. manually
       moving it as I manually opened the throttle) when revving the engine
       eliminated the non-turbo lag I surmised that if I relieved some of the
       tension on the watch spring that trys to close the flap it would open
       up more for a given throttle setting and the non-turbo lag would go
       away. It worked. You just move aside the "lock" holding the big black
       "gear" (mine has "015" inscribed on it every 5 or 6 teeth) in the
       compartment with the potentiometer and rotate it anti-clockwise to
       unwind the spring a bit. If you do it with the engine running you'll
       see the engine speed up as the mixture becomes richer. At least that's
       what happened in this case. I just adjusted it until the engine
       "sounded right" and "smooth" (at the correct idle speed). When I was
       finished the the non-turbo lag was GONE! (I mean REALLY gone!)
       Varroomm Varroomm!

Why did the air flow sensor need this adjustment? I don't know. My only guess
is that the components in the brain box that sense the position of the flap
(via the potentiometer) are getting old and their values (resistances,
capacitances, etc) are drifting. I might be willing to say that I still have
another vacuum leak and that the flap is not opening as much as it should, but
I disconnected everything that might be leaking upstream of the throttle valve
and it ran just as well (I would guess that the mixture would have ended up too
rich and it would have ran rough if there had been a leak).

All I know is that it's running like crazy (for the first time since I bought
it back in May). Now all I need to do is get one of the trunk hinges rewelded
(darn previous owners), fix the latches that keep the top on, and hit the road!

Getting ever closer to a potential traffic ticket :-)...

I personally like the 165 lb progressive springs from Troutman
for street/autox applications. They have exactly the right length
for stock ride height, and work like factory HD springs under 
nominal load, but crank up to 165 lb at full excursion. Great stuff.

For track, I use various weight 2.5" ID circle track springs over infinitely 
adjustable collars on yellow Konis (sport valving) from Paragon Products in 
Corpus Christi, TX.  Sure, it's expensive, but it *WORKS*.

For the cheap at heart, I have a set of orange Konis with only 8 races
and 1 autox on them, with a pair of 100 lb and another pair
of (I think) 140 lb springs for sale cheap... That would be like $400
new, will sell for $180. No, I won't break the set.

There was a longish debate on this about a year or 2 back (in rec.autos.tech).
If I remember right, Du Pont (inventors & patent owners of Teflon (R) aka
PTFE) claimed that Teflon would decompose under the temp conditions in the
engine.  They disallowed Slick mfgrs from using Teflon on their
advertising/labelling.  That's why no one advertises Teflon, save one --
and this is from Du Pont (who, later saw the market I guess, jumped in and
offered a competing product -- and no, I can't remember the product name).

Disclaimer:  I don't have any connection with any of these
companies/products.  Heck, I don't even use them.

Now, let's think about how the PTFE is carried.  Suspended as particles in
a single weight oil (SAE30, might have changed since a year ago).  If
coating PTFE on a frying pan under controlled conditions is difficult
enough, how about *uncontrolled* conditions inside your engine, where
you're depending on luck to have an even coating.  You can't even control
the temperature.

Next, what does your oil filter filter out?  suspended particles, right?
How is the PTFE carried?  suspended particles.  

Of course empirical/anecdotal evidence is usually accepted more strongly,
and we can't always dismiss them.  It may be true that Slick 50 helps, but
I'm not fully convinced.  I used it in my old, old suzuki.  No difference
in running temperature, mileage, ease of starting etc -- all conditions esp
mileage carefully monitored for a year b4 and after adding.  There was a 
noticable improvement after converting to synthetic (but we all know
that).

My opinion:  I'd save my $ for proper maintenance.  If you feel that it
give an improvement, by all means use it.  Afterall, it's your car, and if
you feel an improvement, there probably was.  (Can't help thinking of
placebos here, but that's not quite the same).

Cheers (hope I didn't offend anyone)

Subject: non-Porsche fuel injection follow-up



A while ago I posted some problems with my wife's
Mazda MPV and got some excellent responses. The 
symptoms were that the car would run fine while
cold, but wouldn't accellerate when warm. It felt
like it was running on two (out of four) cylinders.
With the car warm, I could pull the wiring harness
connector off of the thermo-time switch and the car
would run fine.

After testing everything I could to no avail, 
I finally swallowed my pride and took the car in to
the dealer. They had the car for a full week (helped
my pride, but I was fearful for my wallet) They 
couldn't find anything either, but finally swapped
out the plug wires! and the problem went away. I
was skeptical, to say the least. 

The car runs fine. As to why the problem corrected 
itself when the harness was removed from the thermo-
time switch - it put the computer into a "limp home"
mode that must have limited the electronic advance
a bit. Perhaps the wires had more resistance when hot,
and at max advance, the plugs just misfired a lot.
(just a guess)

Thanks for all the good advice, especially considering
the non-porsche nature of the request. I hope the 
information is helpful to others, along with the bottom,
line: sometimes problems are more simple than they 
appear, especially in this age of computer-managed
cars.

Actually, the automatic version of the SHO is significantly
slower in acceleration than the stick, and it has a softer
suspension aimed at the "executive personal car" market.

The manual transmission model of the SHO is a little noisy,
although not much more than any other manual, but the shifter
is an affront to humanity.  The shifts are extremely slow 
and this limits the performance of the car more than any 
other factor.

Both of the doorhandles on my 931 have suffered the same fate.  The
finger trigger piece that breaks is not available separately, nor is
it easily repairable.

I bought a new handle from a junkyard car for $15.  You could either
paint it to make it look new, or press out a pin and swap the finger
trigger from the new handle to your existing piece.

The handle from my 931 had Audi part numbers on it.  I did not check
to see whether they might sell new ones fro a more reasonable cost.

My 78 911SC engine also suffers from a leak at this same spot. Last nite when I
was crawling around the engine compartment (I'm real small...), I saw that the
crank case breather and oil pressure sending unit had considerable oil sludge 
around them. I believe that this may be the cause of my leak, maybe yours too.
Get the back end of the car in the air (on jack stands, of course) and spray some
brake kleen on the bell housing and face of the oil cooler (try to avoid rubber)
to get it real clean and dry around and above where the oil is dripping. Go for a
drive and then look again. If you have fresh oil between the bell housing and the
oil cooler, your leak is most likely coming from the top of the engine. If the 
oil is fresh on the oil cooler itself, it's possible that it has cracked along
one of the weld seams or internally along a fin. Good Luck. Oil coolers are big
bucks.

Subject: 928 Alternator woes......


Following up on someone else's 928 alternator problems, I
have run into a really unique one.....

My 79 928 has eaten its THIRD new alternator. It takes less
time for the mechanic to put one on than it does to munch it.

Fortunately, all this is waranty work, but still it takes
time that I don't have (or I would be working on the car).

I am pretty sure that the voltage regulator is what is
burning out. It seems to be an integral piece on the
Paris-Rhone (sp?) alternator. I have checked the current
draw when the car is operational, it seems to draw
about 1.5 amps steady at 2k rpm, with no accessories
on. The battery tests fine, but the in car voltage meter
never shows it at more than 11 volts, even fresh out of
the charger (this is without the engine running).

Any ideas as to what could be munching things?

Also, what should the oil pressure run on the 928
motor? The owners manual only says:

5k rpm = 5 on the guage. What should it be at
idle?

Any help is well appreciated!

If your pull-lever is like the VW part, then any 944/Audi/VW donor 
handle of correct vintage will work.  Pulling out the pin as swapping 
as suggested above is a great idea.  Otherwise, sounds like junkyard time.

I bought my caliper expander about 15 years ago at an auto parts

automotive tools. As I recall, these displays can still be found in

Subject: Uneven compression after rebuild: normal?


I was looking at a '72 914 1.7 to buy from a private party.
The engine was recently (less than 100 miles ago) partially
rebuilt: new barrels, sleeves, rings, and pistons.  There is
no paperwork to actually document this - but the barrels appear
to be brand new (looking at them) and a call by me to the mechanic
who reportedly did the job corroborates with what the owner is
telling me.  In other words, it's highly *likely* it was recently
rebuilt.

However, the compressions were as follows: 105, 125, 105, 95 (cylinders
1, 2, 3, 4 respectively).  Furthermore, in cylinders 3 and 4, the addition
of a bit of thick oil made the compression increase to 135 and 120.
(This test was not done to cylinders 1 and 2).

Now, is this in all likelihood just due to the fact that the rings are
so new that they haven't fully seated yet?  Will the compressions
go up and/or even out after about 500 miles of driving?  Would
I be stupid not to buy this car because of the uneven compression,
and sort of low compression in number 4?

Or, could the uneven compression be due to an actual *problem*
that is difficult or expensive to fix?

Some other factors: the owner swears the car recently passed California
smog inspection (when he bought the car a few months ago).  However,
an unofficial smog check by my mechanic, with a machine that is
not the latest model (required by law to do smog checks) but capable
of measuring HC and CO emissions, indicated that this 914 *exceeded*
the allowed emissions by far (1229 ppm and 4.64%, respectively).
Furthermore, the spark plugs (less than 100 miles old) have a thin
carbonaceous (but not oily) coating.

Could it be simply that the fuel injection, and/or the valves, need
adjustment, and that this may solve the problem?

The guy will sell me the car for $2550.  Some other bad points are: the
pressure plate or something in the clutch system will need replacement
soon (the cable going to the mechanism is in its "maximum" position,
i.e. no further leeway for adjustment).  The shifting is imprecise
(although I guess this is endemic to pre-73 914s?).  The fuel pump
is flapping in the breeze, its attachment point to the body having
completely corroded (there is a thru-and-thru hole in that part of
the body) - probably from battery acid dripping down.

On the good side, the engine starts well, runs smoothly and reasonably
strongly; the brakes are new and excellent; the body has very little
rust; its appearance (interior and exterior) is nicely restored.

Therefore, I wonder: should I buy this car, if the owner can get it
to pass the smog test?  Or should I just forget it.  I get mixed messages
as to whether $2550 is a good price.  The guy will not go any lower
(he was originally asking $2900).

Thanks in advance for your help!

	Howdy all,

	After Stan posted his for sale notice about Koni shocks for the
914 I thought I would check how much they are new. There 
are two shocks available for the 914 from Koni.  The street/orange shock
has a part number of 8641-1077 (front) and 8241-1050 (rear).  The
race/yellow shock has a part number of 8641-1077 Sport (front) and
8241-1050 Sport (rear).  Both of these shocks are externally adjustable for
rebound only. I did not find a listing for dual adjustable shocks.  Does
anyone know the part number for these, or are the special one-offs? (What
do you use on the EP car, Stan?)

	Here are the prices:

			my price	Tweeks
	8641-1077	~160		214
	8641-1077 Sport	~162		218
	8241-1050	~125		149
	8241-1050 Sport	~140		169

	A friend of mine is a Koni distributor - and gives me really good
prices (not just for the 914 shocks, either).

	Hope that this was informative.  We run Koni SPSS (Showroom Stock)
shock on our race car, and I can't say enough good things abot them for
autox.  They are by far the best shock for the Honda CRx Si that we have
found, and we have tried them all. YMMV.

Subject: '73 911 S vs. '83 911 SC


I am trying to form my own opinion about which 911 would be the best for _me_
to buy. I currently own an '85/2 944 and I am looking for something a bit more
extreme. My criteria are the following (in order of importance to me):

   - fun factor: good handling and powerful motor
     (I do some autocrossing and PCA drivers education)

   - practicality as a daily-driver (dry and rain but no snow)

   - cost of maintenance (MTBF of the motors)

   - purchase price

Some factors that are _not_ important to me:

   - creature comforts: A/C, power windows, etc.

   - fuel economy (if you want to play, you've got to pay)

From my observations so far, the 911 SC seems to be the best match for my
needs, but I would like to know more about the 2.4 L 911 S. I like the
vintage looks of the early 911 and its combination of low weight and high
power. I am worried that a '73 might be too old, too finnicky, and too
expensive as a daily driver. While the '83 911 SC seems like a more solid
car, I am worried about its higher weight and lower power.

And what about the "dreaded lift-throttle oversteer"? As the owner of a
944, I have been spoiled by its neutral handling. Is there a significant
difference between the '73 and the '83 in this respect?

What about tires? Can I put modern performance tires on the '73? Or will I
have to upgrade the wheels? What is the biggest wheel and tire combination
I can fit on a '73 (or an '83) with the stock wheel arches?

What about performance potential? Which car has the potential to be the
best autocrosser, without having to take out a second mortgage on the home?

I am a new member of porschephiles, so please let me know if this topic
has already been covered. I will consult the appropriate archive files if
you can tell me which months to download.

They're Koni's but they're also about old enough to vote... It's an
orange and white unit, dual oil damped, with adjustment knobs at the
top and bottom of the shock, for adjusting jounce and rebound. And if
you're really, really, really nice, Koni will rebuild them for you
for only a little more than a set of new Sport yellow shocks....

Despite my use and semi-glowing review of the sport Koni's, I would
be remiss if I didn't mention that the Koni of today is *NOT* the Koni
of yesteryear... Konis are *supposed* to have life-time warranties.
Turns out that if you send one back to Koni, they basicly tell you
"Well, this one has no more life, so the warranty is up". We have
*NOT* been able to get several shocks rebuilt, either under warranty
or for money. We have to work *REAL HARD* to get the dual adjustable
guys done, and frankly if they weren't so damned useful, we wouldn't
bother...

On the newer racers we've built, we use Bilsteins. I would have used
Bilsteins on my 914 but couldn't get the setup I neeeded to make the
rear end adjustable enough, so went with Koni's. I'm happy enough with
the shocks, just not the manufacturer. Sigh.

Oh, in case anyone cares: I also use Konis on my 356, and my BMW
R90/6. In both cases the shocks are *VERY* old, but still quite
functional.

Marilyn, thanks for the note, and everybody I CC'ed to:

Things are OK here.  All the computers at work survived.  The phones didn't 
come back too quickly.  I was awake when it started.  Boy it was wild.  It 
started shifting around but then the TV flashed off and I thought "BIG".  I 
jumped up and stood in the doorway at my front door as the world was 
shaking and reached for my boots balancing and put them on quickly planning 
on how to collect my stuff including all valuables, money, food, and 
protective gear, as quickly as possible if I would be able to find anything 
under the rubble.  I was yelling at my roomate to get under the door 
because he was asleep.  I was imagining that we were about to enter hell.  
Then it stopped shaking all of a sudden.  My appartment complex has 
emergency lighting which went on immediately.  Everything was still 
standing.  Boy, was I stoked.  I figured the worst must have been someplace 
else since we had been expecting the BIG one for a while.  But as it turned 
out over time it wasn't too big.  I hope this takes some of the stress off 
that big 8.0 one they used to talk about.  After this one.  I am quite 
fearful that one of larger magnitude would cause massive destruction.  It 
was very scary.  But for now it's back to work!

Talk to you soon!

Maybe you're not aware of this but Porsche has not only copyright to

and the text on the inside of your fuse box and *EVERYTHING ELSE YOU CAN
THINK OF*. They've even trademarked the *SHAPE* of the 911....

Porsche AG makes over 75% of its net revenue from basicly intellectual
property development -- new technology or designs for other customers,
license fees, etc. They are *VERY*  *GOOD* at protecting their intellectual
property. In fact, if you see any non-dealer shop displaying the Porsche
crest in their advertising, rest assured that they will eventually be
asked to stop it. One shop I know of got to re-paint their building on
24-hour notice to correct the offense.

Randy,

How about a Carrera?

I know of an 84 Carrera that you can get for $15K.  The car has 220k
miles on it but is in perfect shape.  New gear box, engine still strong.
I have no connection with this car, it just happens that a friend at
work has been looking for a Carrera for a while now and I go along to
check out the cars for him.

Why do it this way?  You could remove alot of gadgets to lighten it
up.  Then you would have a *reliable* fast base to start from.  All it
would need is suspension upgrades for AutoXing.  But then they all do
anyway.  Maybe do a valve job or an engine rebuild later to keep it
fresh?  It just seems like older cars are always getting Carrera
upgrades anyway, why not start with something you can build on that
already has the right chain tensioners, oil cooler, etc...?
I guess the negative would be the rules may put you in a modified
class and may make it more difficult to be competitive.

The net's collective wisdom might look at your facts and say, "Stay 
away!"  If the engine's just been rebuilt, why would the cylinders be 
showing such poor compression?  Maybe because the job was botched?  
What the heck are the emissions doing so high?

I had a friend who once bought a Lotus that just had an "engine

Well, I can tell you a lot about Porsches, but don't know anything about
you (other than what you've just told us). Maybe this will be helpful
anyway...

>   - fun factor: good handling and powerful motor
>     (I do some autocrossing and PCA drivers education)

The '72 and '73 S makes more power than anything until the '81 and up
Euro 911SC (930/10 motor). *BUT* it's all in the top end -- you
gotta want to wind them up pretty hard to see it. The '72 and '73
E doesn't make as much power, but it's a near thing and the power is much
more usable. The US spec 911SC and '80s Carerras are about the same --
there's a little more power in the Carerras but they weigh more too.
The *EARLY* Carerras ('74-77) are also very interesting cars -- much
more so than similar year S models.

>   - practicality as a daily-driver (dry and rain but no snow)

All 911s can be essentially the same -- the trick is in choice of
tire. I've driven them in all kinds of weather -- hard. The Yoko
AVS I have on my Euro SC drive almost as well in the wet as the
dry. I may know about snow in a month (yes, I'm bringing it to NJ...)

>   - cost of maintenance (MTBF of the motors)

Like a good friend of mine says: "Ah yes -- the Porsche 911. It's
not a $20k car, it's a $15k engine rebuild waiting to happen..."
With any 911, change the oil every 3k miles or 3 months using a
Mann filter, natch. Adjust the valves every 6-15k miles, depending
on model. And a "major tune up" once a year to keep the FI parts
in order. I spend about $700 in routine maintenece a year for about
15k miles a year.

If it *breaks*, that's a different league. Book is like 40-60
hours to R & R and rebuild a 911 engine. That's at $45 to $75 
an hour. *PLUS* parts, which are guaranteeed to be minimum of
$550 if you can use *everything* that came off the car except the
obvious expendibles (bearings, seals, etc.)

Figure the 2.0 engine at 100K mile life, the 2.2 and 2.4 at about
75K, the 2.7 at under that, the 3.0 at over 150K, the 3.2 at
close to 200K, and who knows about the new ones... Your milage
may vary.

>   - purchase price

'72 S is made of unobtainium. Figure $20k minimum for a car in good
shape, or equivalent if you buy a cheaper car and need to bring it up to
good shape. '73 S is about the same, but cheaper (doesn't have that
cute little '72 outboard oil tank door to make it more "valuable").
For that kind of money you can get a nice mid-80s Carerra. Or a very
nice early Carerra. Or *TWO* early 911SCs, if you shop hard...
Seriously. I've seen *NICE* cars under $10k...

>Some factors that are _not_ important to me:
>
>   - creature comforts: A/C, power windows, etc.

A/C is hard to do and makes the car hard to work on. If you need to 
add it later, I.C.E. makes a very nice kit for about $1k. Power windows
just come with the later cars. Power door locks were an option from
the SC up.

>   - fuel economy (if you want to play, you've got to pay)

Yup. Bigger engine == more gas, but smaller engine at high RPM can == 
big gas too...

>From my observations so far, the 911 SC seems to be the best match for my

My personal tastes run to the early cars too, but after looking for a *LONG*
time, I bought the Euro SC I have now. (It's for sale, BTW, priced
reasonably -- holler if you want more info...) There just aren't any 
good '72-3 S models out there -- you figure that if there were, what
about 1500 of them made and *EVERYONE* "knows" that that's the year to have
that the market will work and prices will be high...

It's also the case that the early cars will have more work to be done.
IN part, because they're old. In truth, most likely because they've
been abused buy people who wanted a "cheap Porsche". Depending on your
requirements, you may be better off with a car that is *NOT* for the
street -- a tub can be acquired for under $2k, and you can build a
fantastic autox/time trial/etc car for another $15k on top of that...

The later cars are better developed (see next question for more details)
and if you shop right, you can *STEAL* them. If you can swing it, the
*OPTIMUM* thing to do is buy a car with a thrashed motor CHEAP and then
build what you want. You'll still come in under $20k, and have a great
car that *YOU* know everything about...

>And what about the "dreaded lift-throttle oversteer"? As the owner of a

Some. The cars with "Carerra flares" (i.e. 74+ Carerras, 911SCs, '80s
Carerras) can have much larger rear tires and wheels, which helps
some.  You can tune the suspension to be pretty neutral on a 911, but
then again, you can also learn how to drive with lift throttle oversteer.
I guarantee that it will take several seconds off your track lap times...

>What about tires? Can I put modern performance tires on the '73? Or will I
>have to upgrade the wheels? What is the biggest wheel and tire combination
>I can fit on a '73 (or an '83) with the stock wheel arches?

I know of one guy (on this list) with like 225 fronts and 245 rears on
his late 911, not a problem. If *I* tried that, I'd break something
for sure... On the early cars, without flares, you can put 205s on
and maybe 215s if you're lucky. But I know a lot of guys running
A008s in 205x15 on early cars and kicking ass...

You can put 7x16 on the front, and 8x16 on the rear of most cars with
flares, but 7x16 is pretty much it all  the way around on the non-flare
cars. YOU probably want to use 15s though, for lower gearing...

>What about performance potential? Which car has the potential to be the
>best autocrosser, without having to take out a second mortgage on the home?

Tossup. Depends on class, degree of preparation, and (drum roll here) ---
YOU. If you have a car that *MUST* be run to 7k RPM to perform and
you just can't bring yourself to do it, then who cares what the potential
is -- *YOU* won't ever realize.  If you have a car that is traditionally
hot in a prepared class and you insist on running bone stock, you may
be geting your clock cleaned.

John,

The tool is VW1342, and lists for about $129 in my outdated Zelenda
catalog.  You also need a couple of adaptors, listed in the 944
workshop manual.

The reason the manuals don't call out impedences is probably that you
cannot easily validate them.  With, for example, a thermostat or
temperature switch, you can stick them in a pot of water on the stove,
and with a thermometer verify whether they operate to spec.

The oil pressure senders do fail with age.  They'll seep oil, and the
bakelite ring between the large part of the shell and the threaded
section swells and gets ugly.  If this sounds like yours, replace it.
This is best done with a crowfoot, 24 mm I think, on a suitably long
extension bit.

I bought one, a KD Tools variant, a few years ago.  Came off the

Intent to profit doesn't matter. In fact, you can argue in court that
that's *WORSE* since it damages the company more (as you're presumably
selling for cheaper since you don't care about profit) and there's no
related assets to attach to compensate the company for your gross
misconduct.

Sorry if I seem a little testy on this subject -- I have also derived the
vast majority of my income over the years from intellectual property
sales, licenses, etc.

But you're right -- in principle, it would be easier to use a CD-ROM

As the proud owner of a 1990 SHO, I can't for the life

There was a recall on the clutch for 1989 and 1990 SHOs

clutch (basically a racing clutch), but as for any of 
them exploding, I can't think of any.

I do recommend the extended warrranty as Ford dealers

For those who receive Panorama,

I finally got my copy of Pano yesterday, one of the last

my own expense.

In the "From The Regions" section is a blurb from Ohio
Valley Region with an accompanying photo of, Lo and 
Behold, My 911, with a snowman atop it.  I'm the tall
guy in the back without a hat, but not without hair.

Lest you think it is a staged photo, that really is the
paddock at Mid-Ohio, and that was Halloweeen weekend.
Oddly enough, I have been to only two driver schools
there, the other being last April, and we had snow both
times.

The written excerpt might suggest that the snow kept us
from having any fun.  Not So.  Mid-Ohio does not give
refunds, and does not close down for mere inconveniences
of nature, so I stuck it out and got my money's worth.
I left the slicks in the garage and ran on rain tires.
Besides, there were bragging rights at stake.  It was
a BMW CCA driving event, and the 911 drivers have to show
the M5 drivers who's boss.

Driving in snow, slush, rain, and low visibility is very
educational in such a controlled environment.  You get
all the sensations of being at the limit of adhesion,
without the high speeds ( I kept it below 100 on the
back straight).  My instructor said he enjoyed it,
but I know he was lying, because I have no heat exchangers,
and he had icicles hanging from his mustache.

So now the jig is up about how I baby the car.  The next
time I try to sell it, I'll have to say, "Never driven
in snow, except when tracked."

Looking forward to spring break in Las Vegas,

The MFI is *HIGHLY* reliable and can give performance that far exceeds
anything else -- IFF the internal parts are in good shape and the
blasted thing is adjusted right. There lies the rub -- if you think
the EFI or CIS systems are complicated and hard to work on, you haven't
seen anything yet...

As is true of most of the parts on most of the older cars, all of the MFI
pumps and  distributors probably need to be rebuilt. And then calibrated to
the engine you have *now* -- many of the 2.4s got rebuilt using S
pistons and cylinders for higher compression (and hence more power)
at some point in the past, some got 2.7 pistons and cylinders to bring them
up to what, 2.5 liters? Odds are good that if such changes happened, the
other necessary stuff *DIDN'T*. Any such change means the fuel requirements
will change, both in terms of quantity and progression (i.e. how much
when). In my experience, that's the number 2 cause of dissatisfaction
with MFI (number one being dead internal part or misadjustments).

Recommendation: have your MFI system rebuilt by someone *COMPETENT*
(i.e. this is *NOT* a typical Porsche dealer or local service facility
job -- you gotta have special tools, access to parts, and *EXPERIENCE*
to get it right). Then see how you like it. Problem: some people
note that it's only a few hundred more to downgrade their cars to 
Webers. Note that the factory stopped using carbs for all performance
applications  a *LONG* time ago. Note the careful use of the word
"downgrade" in my comment. 'Nuf said.

Dear driver friends,

I have a (simple?) problem.  I am planning to go to Europe (Belgium and
France) for 3-4 months.  I thought it would be a good idea to take my
'84 911 with me.  However, my insurance company seems to have a different
opinion:  They do not insure my car if it leaves the continent.  So,
it would imply that I should buy a short-term insurance in either France
or Belgium, but I want to keep my US immatriculation.  I have two
questions.

1)  Would you know of a good American insurance company that would insure 
my car while abroad?
2)  If not, would you know of a good European insurance company that would
insure my car while there?

Thanks for your input,

My '72T has had no problems with its mechanical injection in the six
years I've owned it.

I'm not sure, but I think at some point the 911E and S originally had the
same mechanical injection.  Later they all went to the Bosch Jetronic 
injection.  I think there was a "73 and a half" (where's the old
typewriter "one-half" key when you need it :-) 911T that came out with 
the Bosch injection.  If I had my books at work I could check for sure.
Does anyone else know the exact lineage of the fuel injection systems on

I think that one or both of the gas struts (correct name?)

   other one on the way out as well?

2. How do I identify the defective strut if only one needs

Subject: 3.2/3.0 rebuild

    Ken-

    Thanks for your response and request for more info on my 3.2/3.0
    rebuild.  I agree with you that I don't have a 3.2 to rebuild.
    This is what I do have:

    From a 1985 Carrera 3.2- engine case, lay shaft, oil pump, chain
    tensioners, exhaust/heat exchangers, DME, Motronic, distributor,
    clutch, fly, transmission, and brain.

    From some 3.0 SC- Piston and cylinder set (pistons are Schmidts,
    but cylinders are Mahles- I am not sure what the comperssion is on
    these things), various heads- all presumably 3.0 with dates
    ranging from late 1977 to 1983, cam housing and cams (I thought
    these were the same for SCs and Carreras but a comment from Stan
    leads to be think I might be wrong), a crank with rods, and
    whatever else I can't think of.

    The history on this beast is a little vague but here goes:
    Several years ago the original owner brought it to somebody to
    have something done (I said it was vague!!).  Apparently either to
    save time or money they put a 3.0 l crank, rods, P/C set, and
    heads (with one head "machined" [read "butchered"] to take the
    temp sensor).  After they put the thing back in the car and ran it
    for a few minutes it quit and never started again.  Apparently
    somebody did not have the money nor enthusiasm to discover the
    problem or split the case so it sat around for a couple of years
    until my friend bought it.  It sat with him for a while and then I
    bought it from him.  When I split the case I discovered that the
    brass distributer drive gear on the crank was trashed/distorted
    and free wheeling about the end of the crank-  I am guessing that
    circlip was either an old one, the wrong size, or not put on
    completely during the rebuild, and simply gave way.

    Well Ken, that is about it.  I am planning on putting the final
    product in my 71 911 either with DME/Motronic, with Carbs, with
    higher compression PCs, with shaved heads, or whatever
    combination will work.  I am not necessarily committed to the
    idea of making this the ultimate engine on this rebuild, so
    maybe I might do the easist/cheapist rebuild now and then after
    running it for a season I'll upgrade some part of the engine.
    Oh yea, I am planning on tracking this car but want to be able
    to drive it to the track.  I am definetly planning on getting
    rid of the exhuast and using headers and super traps or
    something.  If you, or anyone else out there, can come up with
    suggestion and comments I would appreciate them.

    Thanks

On a more serious note than my last reply - most of the major US rental 
companies have European partners or subsidiaries. Hertz (Hertz), National 
(Tilden), Dollar (Eurodollar) etc. Many of them offer special rates for US 
tourists as long as the booking is made from the US and not at the 
destination.  The problems to watch for in Europe is the excessive CDW they 
charge and , if you choose to not take them the will often put a massive 
charge on your credit card (several thousand dollars) until you return the 
car undamaged, leaving you with little or no usage of that card during your 
visit.

Also, a while ago I sent mail concerning a problem on my 77 911S the solution to

That's the theory. But if even if you modify it, what you did is now
a derived work, and as such covered under the original copyright.
But that doesn't keep you from using your copy... you just can't

	The gasket set you need is one for a late model 3.0 SC. All the
gaskets for the heads will be the correct size assuming the intake port

getting a set for a 78-79 SC and buying a late flywheel seal.

Ben,

     If you're in Britain, and the bonnet only stays up when it's
warm, I would guess it hasn't been staying up for several months
now ;)

     At about $15 each, I suggest replacing both.  Then you can
keep the best of the old pair for a spare.  They are trivial to
replace, with the exception of re-installing the spring clip
which holds the pin in place on the lower end of the driver side
strut (on NORMALLY configured models).  Having lost said clip
whilst (note the Briticism) replacing mine 3 years ago, my cross
pin has stayed in place without it.

     Replacement techniques vary.  I just held the bonnet up with
some combination of my head and shoulder.  Be sure the required
tools (pliars) and "bits" are within easy reach - or - you can
have someone hold it up for you.  Should take about 10 min.

Subject: Re: '73 911 S vs. '83 911 SC

This is interesting -- it's the same choice to which I came.  I've determined,
I think, which is best for me (and am in the process of selling my current car 
so I can get the 911).  I'll explain my choice and reasoning at the end of 
this post.

Randy Evans writes (re: 73 911S vs 83 911SC):

> My criteria are the following (in order of importance to me):
>   - fun factor: good handling and powerful motor

From the research I've done, the cars have about the same 0-60 (which is
where I get most of my power jollies anyway).  The difference is where in the 
RPM band you get your torque.  The '73 gets its torque at a higher RPM (around
4-5K) than does the SC (around 2-3K).  To get the acceleration out of the S,
you'll have to keep the revs higher.

>   - practicality as a daily-driver (dry and rain but no snow)

I had a '69 911S as a daily-driver for four years.  Drove it in rain or shine.  
It was completely practical.  Once I fixed what was wrong with the car when I
bought it (this wasn't cheap), the car needed tires, tune-ups, oil, and 
batteries (one pair of them little b*st*rds every year or so).

>   - cost of maintenance (MTBF of the motors)

About 150K miles for the S, about 300K miles for the SC (from what I've heard).
Costs about 8K-10K (if you elect to replace the pistons -- there seems to be
some, a little, debate about whether you need to do this).

>   - purchase price

About the same in this neck-of-the-woods (Los Angeles/Orange County).  The SCs 
are a lot more plentiful, so the prices are easier to judge.  I think they both
tend to go for around $15K for an average specimen.  I've seen 'em as low as
$10K and as high as about $23K.  I'm shooting for the $15K region.

Something else that you should consider: insurance.  State Farm treats older
cars as being quite different from newer cars.  The difference between a '72S
and a '80SC was over $1000 per year (that's a thousand, for those who think I
missed a decimal place :->).  Depending on how many miles per year you put on 
the car and how long you expect to have it, this could make-up for the 
difference in MTBMotors.

>Some factors that are _not_ important to me:

I agree 100%.

>From my observations so far, the 911 SC seems to be the best match for my

Personally, I picked the '72/'73S (and I want a Targa).  The performance is 
about the same, the ultimate cost is probably not that much different (when 
you consider the insurance cost), and I like the 'feel' of the old cars with 
their peaky engines.

>I am worried that a '73 might be too old, too finnicky, and too
>expensive as a daily driver. 

My '69 wasn't a problem.  Moreover, the SC has more stuff to break (e.g.,
electric windows and cruise control).

>While the '83 911 SC seems like a more solid
>car, I am worried about its higher weight and lower power.

I don't think the difference would be noticable.  The horsepower (which affects
top speed but not 0-60) is not that different (S=190, SC=180-20?, depending on 
year) and the top speeds are within 5 MPH of each other.  I don't have the 
torque numbers, but I believe that the 0-60 is right at 7 seconds for either 
car.

It'd be really cool, however, to reduce the weight of the SC by going to an
RS-style configuration.  Door pulls rather than handles, roll-up windows,
no sound deadening, maybe thinner glass and a fiberglass hood would all lower
weight and take advantage of the output of the 3 litre engine.  Hmmm. . .

I don't know, but I don't think so.  I can attest to the difficulty of this
problem felt in a '69, though :-)

>What about tires? Can I put modern performance tires on the '73? Or will I

I had Pirelli P-6's (if you call those modern performance tires) on my '69.  
Worked fine (the Falkens, however, sucked out loud).

Ultimately, I don't see a clear winner.  The performance is about the same
(although the higher weight of the SC might make it handle a little worse),
and the purchase price and up-keep seem to even-out in the end.  For a while,
I was persuaded by the longer block life of the 3.0 engine to go for the SC,
but now I think I like the flavor of the '72 a little better.

Anyone else have any thoughts?

Stan recently replied that he has Yoko AVSi tires on his Euro SC. I just wore
out a set of these in 8k miles on the rear of my 87 911 and was wondering if
anyone could comment on their experience with these tires. Wear is very uniform
and rear alignment etc. was checked my mechanic (who also recommended these
tires and was surprised by the wear) The Yoko dealer that I purchased them from
thinks something must have been wrong with the tires and is trying to get
approval to replace them. Except for the wear issues I love the tires, but
unless replaced for free or nearly free I am not sure that I can justify the
cost of the performance provided by these tires.

******************************************************************************
Does anyone know of an accurate way of testing the shock absorbers on my car?
1--More--0
I've heard that you can press down on the corner of the car, release, and watch
to see how many oscillations it does to determine the condition of the shocks.
This doesn't seem reliable in the light of the fact I can never push hard
enough to simulate the car's weight, nor does it compensate for the different
damping rates of various shocks.
******************************************************************************

	Tom,

	Actually, pushing down the corner of your car CAN be a pretty reliable
way to test your shocks if you have a pretty good eye.

	To see if your shocks are good, push down the corner of the car that
has the shock you want to test and release.  If that shock is good, the car
should travel through one full cycle of oscillation and then come to rest.
That is, when you release it, it should travel up above ride height, then
come down below ride height and then come back up to ride height and come to
rest.  
	It shouldn't matter if you aren't able to push the car down far 
enough to simulate its actual weight.  Since the springs on a car are very
linear (ie. their return force is proportional to displacement), the optimal
damping rate will be independent of the height of the bumper.  As long as the
bumper moves enough for you to see it, it should be okay (if you can't see
it, find a friend to help push harder).  

	If your shocks are warn out, the car will go through more than one
oscillation.  If it goes through less than one oscillation, you are driving
a 1985 Corvette and should look for a better car to drive.

Hope that helps.

It may not be worth replacing both, if you willing to measure the
struts.  

>
>2. How do I identify the defective strut if only one needs
>   to be replaced
>

Over the years I had collected a bunch of the 911 gas struts 
(gas springs) and wanted to see how a new and old strut compared 
in applied force.

So I chucked one end of the gas strut in my drill press and put a bathroom
scale on the drill press table with a block of wood on the bathroom scale
for the gas strut to press against.

Without turning the drill press motor on, the quill was used to force 
the gas strut piston into the block of wood.  The measurement was taken
with the piston depressed a small amount. I neglected the weight of the
block of wood and the strut piston. 

As I remember, a new 911 front gas strut was about 95 lbs, and my
collection of old struts ranged from 60 - 80 lbs.  So there was 
a 15% to 36% leakdown.  

If you want to avoid measuring the struts, I'd recommend getting the 
latest date code struts.  A gas strut will leak down during storage, 
so a "new old stock" gas strut could be worse than one on the car.

The date code is printed on the gas strut.

>3. Are there any gotchas that would prevent a novice 911
>   mantainer from replacing the struts?

You can use a long piece of wood to prop the hood fully open,
then you pull the clips out and the pins.  

The piston rod is installed pointing down, probably to keep the seal wiping 
any piston rod dirt to the bottom.

The main problem I had was getting the clips back on.

A hemostat is handy to hold the clips.

There are some aftermarket options.

Some vendors are selling higher pressure gas struts and one vendor, 
Target Motorsports, sells a double up kit, in which you connect
two old struts in parallel.

I tried the double up kit.

By sorting through my basket of old gas struts, I found two that
paralleled would exceed the new strut spec, but not by too much. 

The kit consists of some long 6mm pins, some spacer washers and some 
clips.  With the long pins, two struts can be mounted in parallel
on each hinge.

When I installed two old struts on one side, the closed hood was 
pushed up a small amount at the hinge area by the doubled up struts.  

But, the hood would stay up, so the kit remained in the car.

The same problem should occur with the higher pressure gas struts.

My guess is the Porsche factory tried higher pressure struts and
the hood fit was unacceptable.  So they kept dropping the pressure 
until the hood fit was acceptable.  So there isn't a lot of margin for 
normal strut leakdown and cold temperatures.

From the gas law, pressure is proportional to absolute temperature.

If you're seeing a drop from 20 degrees C to 0 degrees, the absolute
temperature is going from 293 degrees K to 273.  This corresponds to
the gas struts dropping in applied force by 7%.  Not a great deal,
but enough if the struts are on the margin.

Subject: Re: Car rental in Rome

Kim, a few pointers (I live in northern Italy, so my predjudices may show):

        Type of car: six people (all adults, I assume) will have a tough time 
fitting in one car - even Mercedes. You'd have to rent a small van (probably 
Fiat van) with enough seats for all plus luggage. Doable, but the small streets 
and high-power traffic would make it tough to get around, and parking would be 
very bad (plan on using pay parking lots almost exclusively). I recommend 
finding a second brave driver and renting two cars -- more flexibility, easier 
to get around, etc. Downside is higher rental cost. 

        Size of car: Hmmm. Assuming you go the van route, you'll need a Fiat van
for six persons. For cars, an Opel or BMW 5-series would be good. If they offer 
you a Fiat Uno, plan on getting four -- they're tiny! Bad side of Fiat: they 
break a lot. Good side of Fiat: they can be repaired anywhere (may be a 
corrolary of previous law).

        Rental company: Many credit card companies offer to cover your CDW and 
other charges on car rentals -- in other words, you don't have to accept the 
highly expensive insurance fees. Hertz, for one, has said they _won't_ accept 
credit card reimbursement for such charges in Italy. I don't use Hertz in Italy 
for that reason. (Other locations might be OK.) Check with the rental company.

        License. I bring this up because we're in the middle of a crisis here. 
The provincial paramilitary police (Carabinieri) have told us that rental 
companies will no longer accept US drivers' licenses for car rentals UNLESS they
are translated into Italian by the Italian Auto Club (ACI). Also they will 
accept International Drivers' Licenses. Obvious money-generator for ACI; could 
be a frustration for all. This may be only a local rule, vice a national one, so
you may get more info from the car rental company. A good bet is to go to AAA 
and get an International license.. a pain in the kazoo, to be sure, but better 
than walking. 

        Driving. I've driven many times in Rome and have found it about as hard 
as New York City. Italian drivers are better than Americans but are used to 
small cars and fast roads.. if there's a space there, they assume its because no
one else wants it and they'll take it. I wouldn't take my Porsche there but I'll
drive a Fiat any time. You don't have to drive like they do... but remember to 
signal early, stay right, observe the rules (even if they don't), and keep calm.
They station cops on street corners to observe traffic, and if you break a rule,
the cops take your license number and send the ticket to the car rental company,
which is real good about tracking you down and making you reimburse them for the
ticket. 

Absolute Do's: Lock your car (including the anti-theft alarm), take _all_ your 
personal belongings out of the car when unattended (even out of the trunk) and 
get all the insurance you can (this includes an international Green card, 
required to cross borders).

Absolute Don'ts: Talk to/give money to panhandlers at street corners/ 
intersections (including the ones who claim they're Bosnian refugees; when you 
roll down the car window to talk to them, they grab your watch/jewelry and run);
try to beat _anyone_ at a light; get p.o.'d when someone passes you on a small, 
hilly, windy road; drive in Naples.

Best of luck. Write if you need more.

Howdy,
Well,my '58 A coupe is looking better every day now.
I am finished welding-repairing-replacing the front inner wings and
more, and will soon start replacing the floor pan.I will need angled
pieces as the pan 'mounts' are to rusty.
I'm using Danish panels for the car, and the quality is 'better than
original'!
And the outer panels are being sanded to bare metal.This'll be a
complete chassis rebuilld and I guess I have to save the leather
interior and original square weave carpet until until next year.

I'll stick to DM 350 carpet set and a $400 reupholstery job in
'look-a-like' vinyl this year.i can always use those items in my '60
coupe later.

I have a few questions about how to weld the pan, longitudinals,
jack-receiver's,etc.So far I've seam welded the front structural
pieces.The pan,longitud's and battery box shouldn't be done this way I
guess??
I am thinking of spot welding these and would likt to get any
information about the distances I should use between the spot welds.  
Also I would appreciate if someone had a pattern of the original T-2
pedal board patterns.I have the plywood awaiting.
The jack receivers should be welded just outside the longitudinal
support (rear), but can these be mounted after the longitudinal is welded
to the car?I've read they cant,but I do not understand why? Unless the
longitudinals shape will alter some during the attachement to the car.

I am MAG welding,but it's a sure hell with those thin panels.Guess I
have to use a lot of body solder both here and there to get a tight
chassi afterwards.

Rebuilding the ZF-Ross steering box: have any out there rebuillt these
pieces?Where can one get spare parts?I am thinking of perhaps grinding
0.1-0.2 mm's off the adjustable 'nut'(peg?) (havent got my manual with me)
so that this one will be 'broader' in the 'screw'(worm?) without
touching its base.

I've tried adjusting the steering box,but forgot to do this in middle
position.Perhaps that is why it seemed 'bad'.

Anyway parts supplier for restoring ZF-Ross boxes are welcome.

Any information or viewpoints is welcome.

I'll add my own two cents about the factor that convinced me to get a 911 
SC, that's the galvanized body = (almost) no rust.  I have the impression 
that finding a no rust 73 911 S means top dollar, while no rust 911 SC's 
are faily common.

The other important factor was the longer lasting engine, but that's been 
discussed.

While I'm at it I might as well mention the other features that I looked 
for.  I wanted the 'boy racer' look (you know, SC flares, tail, low body, 
etc) but also wanted the creature comforts of a great GT car and I didn't 
want a non-original looking car (like a Carrera tail on an SC, etc.).  I 
spent a year looking for the car and trying to be very honest with my 
self about what I wanted out of the car and my budget.  I advise all

Last Friday night, I was driving out of an underground parking garage in
my '69 912.  The driveway is _very_ steep, and I was forced to stop half-
way up due to cars further up waiting for street traffic to clear.

912 drivers are aware that it takes a lot of RPM and clutch finessing
to get the 912 to move up a moderate grade, much less something as
steep as a staircase.

When the car in front of me drove forward a car length, I rev'd up and 
eased out the clutch.  My foot was all the way off the pedal, and the car 
didn't move an iota.  Ouch!  I backed up a couple of feet and tried again, 
no go (literally).

Then came the fumes...  :-(

I backed all the way down and drove out another way, and drove home
very conservatively.

Since then (six days ago), I still smell clutch burn from time to time.

I have never sensed any clutch slippage at any speed, before or since.

What did I do to my clutch/flywheel/pressure plate?  How do I tell if
there is any permanent damage?  I've only got 20k on this clutch, and
do not relish the idea of dropping the engine if I can avoid it.

The practice of squirting oil into a cylinder to see if you can bring

Subject: Help need with a 2.4


I have a friend who has a baffling problem.

He has a kit car (called an Eagle, it has gull wing doors).

The chassis and bodywork are kit / home build.

The  engine / gear box / running gear / suspension are 
are all 911 of various vintages.

His problem is that when the engine is USED, i.e. driven
hard on a track or a long strenuous freeway run something
on the top of the engine sprays a little oil around. The
amount is no more that a pint per 30min track session. It's
obviously not serious enough to cause major engine failure, 
but very iritating as it covers the entire engine comp.

The oil is clearly comming out under high pressure (due to
the nature of the spattering ). The source appears to be 
around the top of the engine, where the oil pressure switch
is, or where the top breather hose. Thinking the obvious
we have dismantled both of these a refitted them very
carefully but still the leak persists.

We tried most of the local p-garages but no success.

Does anyone have any ideas?

They only deviation from factory specs we can find is that 
the oil tank is 1 inch higher than it should be, is that
the problem?

Yours hopefully

The 'E' is for the German word Einspritsung (sp?) which, essentially, means
injected.  The 911Es were always injected.  

The early 'S' models (pre-'69, though I don't know about '68) were carburated.  
After that, the S was injected.  Before late 1973, the fuel injection on 
street Porsches (I know NOTHING about racing Porsches) was Bosch mechanical.

I think that the '72-'73 US Spec. 911T had Bosch mechanical injection.  In
late '73, all 911s got fitted with CIS injection.

Subject: Re: Hood struts

        Reply to:   RE>Hood struts
Heavy duty hood struts are available from many vendors.  I've had very
good results with the ones from Automotion (800-777-8881) on my 88
and 89 911's.  You should replace both however, since one good and one
bad won't do the trick.  You will find the driver's side a bitch to replace.
It's very cramped and hard to reach, but it can be done (you may need to
be creative with tools, but no special ones are required -- just patience
and steady hands).  The passenger side is easy.

A terrific alternative to hydraulic struts is a $40 rachet-like strut sold
by Vertex, 570 W. 39th Place, Hialeah, FL  33012 (305-556-4881).  You
only need to buy one and it can be installed just like a normal strut on
the passenger side in 5 minutes.  Once installed, you raise the hood,
listen for the "click", and gently lower an inch or so to the stop.  Release
by raising the hood all the way past the last "click" and gently lower.
These struts are mechanical (no fluids so no leaks), and guaranteed for
life.  They worked great on my 84 cab.  The only downside is you have to
know how to work them, and others who might open your hood won't get
it.  I used to leave a bold notice in plain view under the hood explaining
their use.

Subject: 911 engine/trans. corner

Lots of discussion today!  Anyway, see the name I gave this?  Stan said I
could give it a try; if we do this,& we who are primarily 911 folks know
where to look.

1. Steve and his box of engine parts

Steve, buddy, you've got a combination that even I haven't tried!!  Best of
luck and let us know how it comes out...  But to answer the cam question, yes
the 3.0/3.2 cam is the same, they just spec'd different timing (not much
difference either way), and went from the big nut to hold the gear to a
stretch bolt.  I'd also watch out w/ the KS piston/Mahle cylinder thing
you've got...never done that myself.

Also, when Steve asked about a gasket set someone replied that the flywheel
seal is different from early to late.  It isn't; same FW seal from '78-89
(also fits 928 and all 944).  Nor is there any difference in intake gaskets,
you'll get the large diameter ones in a gasket set. (Now if you specifically
go to the dealer you might have a choice.)

2. Replacing 911 top end (heads, cam boxes, etc.) as a unit

That's the only way to do it.  This person also referred to putting FOUR base
gaskets under his cylinders.  Any particular reason?  I've never seen that
done; that's .040" worth of gaskets!

3.  Wants to but early S, or SC, general comments

Comments were made about oil filters (Mahle filters are just fine, too), 911
AC factory or aftermarket (I could write a book on that one, email me for
more info), and engine life of various 911 engines.

a.  2.4 engines are the diesel truck configuation of the 911 series; they
last forever when rebuilt w/ today's valve guides.  Most have been altered in
some way, though.  3.0/3.2 engines may run forever, but they do get tired
(lose performance) at super high mileage.

b. cost of rebuilding--I don't want to get into it too much here, but it's
how I make my living right now.  And I wouldn't know what to do if a guy gave
me $10K to rebuild an engine stock; it doesn't cost that much unless you're
upgrading things.

c. Stan hit it right on when he said you can make a 911 basically neutral.
You just have to know how to set the thing up right.  I have complete
confidence in my street car right now.  And with that car I got pinched low
in turn 4 at Phoenix Int'l at 105 MPH and had the back step out
some....fastest I've ever slid in a car!

Unrelated, but probably of interest to the group....I saw very few women's
names on our subscriber sheet.  Well, I'm doing my part.  You can welcome
Kris (Kristin930@aol.com) to the group.  I built her up a nice 930 3.0
recently; Amazon Green for those who know the color.  She's 28,  got long
blonde hair and it never fails that stray 911 owners end up following her
wherever she drives the car!  Drop her an email, guys, and welcome her; she
knows A LOT about 911's and 930's.

The best way to see Rome is on foot. It's a totally nuts town
to try to drive in - motor scooters, bicycles, pedestrians and
little minicars *everywhere*  The best *invisible* car that 
would hold six would be an Alpha 164. Nice car, lots of power.
A Rover 800 would also a be a good choice, and a little more
comfortable. Both of these cars would also insulate you from 
all the yelling and screaming other drivers will aim at you if
you generally try to obey traffic laws. 

The rates would be a lot lower if you can go through a domestic
company - probably a third of what you would pay if you just
show up and rent a car over there. As someone else said, if you
can use American Express or a card with a lot of limit, it helps.
When I was in London several years ago, I stayed at a luxury
hotel and they "set aside" about $3,500 on my Visa card which
would be the total amount for a week visit with all my meals at
the hotel. When I told them I would be paying "cash" with travelers
checks, they thought I was a terrorist and wouldn't release the
"hold" on my Visa until the day I checked out!

Have fun in Rome, It's a wonderful city!

The only difference might be that the '73 is suspended a little stiffer
and is lighter, thus a little easier to "toss around". I found my '73-E
tough to get comfortable driving fast. It took about three months before
I was convinced that I hadn't made a mistake - just because it seemed
so radical for the road. Now, after five years, it's a piece of cake.
I could see sticking a 3.2 liter engine in the beast. The lift throttle
oversteer thing is really overrated. While some good drivers *do* get
into unavoidable circumstances, it's not good practice to lift in the
middle of a turn with any car. With modern sticky tires, you really have
to work at it to swap ends.

You can get excellent tires for the '73, and I've used 205's without
any problems. You can use 215's in the back. If you want to get radical,
you can put SC flares on the '73 and run any tires that you could on
the later car.

I'm *slightly* prejudiced toward '72-'73 911's because they have gobs
of horsepower, they're lighter and IMHO handle a little quicker, and I
just like the way they look. The early S's are getting to be very
collectible (in original sheetmetal) so if you're thinking about it,
get one before the market turns around.

Since your car has electric door locks, you get the button on the console
that locks both doors.  Since you cannot lock your door when it is open
and shut it, thereby potenetially locking yourself out of the car, the
button on the console will not lock the doors when they are open.

The button is to lock both doors once you are in the car.


The switch under the right side of the dash is for dispensing a heavy
duty windshield cleaner if you windshield gets really grimey while you
are driving.  Under your front lid, I believe near the master cylinder,
tucked under the fender, is a separate washer fluid resevoir...looks like
it holds about a liter....that you can put very expensive heavy duty cleaner
into.  that is what is sprayed when you push that rocker switch.

I have never used mine, since I don't know what is really in there
and what it could do to the paint if it is not washed off right away.

you have only a little air in the system.  I always power bleed my

If you absolutely cannot get it power bled, you have two choices.
Either jack the rear end of the car high enough that the slave cylinder
is inclined such that the bubble moves toward the bleeder.  Or take
the slave off the bell and "bench bleed" it.

There's too much mythology (<- euphemism) on this subject floating
around.  As far as I can tell, MFI can be made to work pretty well, some
of the time.

The great "advantage" MFI Porsches have is that they are from an era
just before we worried about surviving accidents (side intrusion bars
weigh), breathing (pollution), and insisted that our sports cars be
bogged down with A/C, power-this-and-that, and stereos.

However, in 1994, you have the option of owning an EFI engine, stock or
very custom, which idles at 800 RPM, hot or cold, passes emissions
(really, not just the silly annual test), and makes more power more of
the time than MFI or carb's every could.  And it does it year 'round.

You'll get traction and steering with front snow tires, but you'll stay 
on the road better with four.  It's just like the advice about matching 
brake compound and tires all 'round - you'll get different (odd, 
dangerous) behavior from each end.  Maybe you'll oversteer into the snowpack.

Four is better.  How much is your Lexus worth...?

Subject: Re: Snow ties for my Other Car

     My experience is twofold. First, I had a 1981 VW Passat, fwd, in 1982 
     in Germany and I put only front snows on it. I then had the ugly 
     experience of going down a a snowy autobahn hill (at about 60km/h) at 
     night, a cat or dog or some other quadruped ran in front of me. I 
     reaction-twitched the wheel and missed subject quadruped, but rear 
     wheels broke free and decided to swap end with front. The cost of the 
     damage was more than the other two snows woulda' been, and I think it 
     would have stopped the swap....
     
     Second, bought snow tires in Germany in '92 for my Saab 900T. Was 
     advised by dealer that German TuV (safety agency) has now mandated 
     that all tires on all wheels have to be same; ie, four snows or four 
     street tires. Not sure if this is a safety issue or a method of 
     getting more DMs for tire mfrs, but TuV is pretty reputable... so who 
     am I to argue? (Wouldn't help, anyway.)
     
     All in all, I'd buy the four, just for the added margin.

Subject: Clutch hydraulics (931/944)

Bleeding the hydraulic clutch on any porsche without a pressure bleeder
is NOT fun, espcially 928's. A trick I found was to take a length of
hose run from one of the bleed screws on one of the front brake
calipers, open the brake bleed screw and pump the brake once or twice to
fill the hose the brake fluid, then put the other end of the hose onto
the clutch bleed screw and open it.Pump the BRAKES serveral times and
watch the reservior for bubbles to stop (this takes a friend or lanky
build and flexibility).Once or twice press the clutch pedal between
pumps on the brakes, you will have to pull the pedal back up.Close both
bleed screws before removing the hose, 951's and 944/2's may require
cracking the clutch hose to pipe fitting along the inside of the brake
booster (with pressure on the pedal) to get the last of the bubbles out.

Can I remove some rear shrouding or (shudder) does the engine have to come out?

Can't find anything in Pellow's books or UpFixing, so it must be easy, right!

Thanks for any help in letting me keep the (356) faith.

Subject: 77 911S TOP END NOISE

A while ago I reported a problem with my 911S which sounded as if I had lost
the quitening curve on my 4-6 cylinder bank cam. Investigation of the cam showed
no problem. A after a considerable intermission I got to pull the heads a week
ago and the problem was obvious. The engine had been rebuilt 3000 miles before
the problem occured. Part of the rebuild involved having the case inserted. At
the same time, as was the practice of the shop, they machined the spigots into
which the barrels fit, taking off a reported 10 thou. They advised me of this
and provided two copper gaskets per cylinder to compensate. It would appear
that with this bank more than 10 thou was machined off. The result being that
the inlet valves were just touching the piston cast flats, shown as a light 
polishing of the flat. I have been advised against machining the flats of the
pistons and propose to fit 4 copper washers on this bank. Any comments?

Also any feeling about refitting the heads and cam housing as one rather than
4 separate pieces.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A further question. Since I obviously have different cam housing hights how
do I work out how many copper gaskets to put under the other side to make them
equal without splitting the case and using a surface plate. Is it that critical?

On the question of heads-cam housing as a unit; so far two opposing opinions! 
Any other votes?

Thanks for clarifying the Compression Testing Stan and as you pointed out I
should have said the solution to the problem appears rather than appeared to be
four copper gaskets..

I tried this with my early 911 with Koni's (not set to full hard)

I could push it down. I know the shocks work by the way the car

Thanks to all who replied.  I quess I knew that all German cars to my

that central locking feature, I thought you could use it to lock the 
doors without the key.  Guess I was wrong.  Why would you want to lock
the doors when you are still inside the car?  Keep out the hijackers?

The concensus on the switch is heavy duty washer fluid.  the switch
has a monentary position, which squirts fluid, but when you release
the wipers keep going.  The headlight washer switch is above this one,
nested between the instruments, and is mentioned in the owner's manual.

Subject: How many snow tires does it take to screw in a lightbulb?


The question of how many snow tires to use on a FWD vehicle is a simple
matter of physics (or is it a matter of simple physics?).  Consider the
case of applying brakes on a snow-covered roadway with snow tires on the
front wheels only.  The rear wheels will have less traction and will
lock-up before the front wheels.  As soon as they lock up the rear end
will come around since the coefficient of sliding friction is lower than
the coefficient of static friction.  This is why, as a number of you have
mentioned, it is best to have similar tires at each corner.  It also
explains why you want to have the 'stickier' tires in the rear if they 
are not the same.

Been there, done that.  In fact, I just had the opportunity to
re-experience the fun of bleeding my 951's clutch a couple of weekends
ago after replacing its seeping hose (a $150 part, btw #%@#$(@$#).  As
hard as it might be to believe, you still have air in the system.  My
method for getting the air out is usually some combination of

1) getting the car as "nose-down" as possible (front tires on the floor
and back end up on my truck jack stands)

2) using the Eezi-bleed tool that is frequently mentioned on this list.
For the clutch only, I use 30 psi on the bleeder, even though the tool
directions suggest 20 psi.

3) pumping the pedal a few times while the Eezi-bleed is attached.
Even though the Eezi-bleed provides positive pressure, I have found
that it may still be necessary to pump the pedal a few times to
dislodge the air.

Hope this helps,
Milo

P.S.: Make sure you remove the pressure from the bleeder before
testing the pedal, or you can be lulled into a "false sense of
success". :-)

	Heavy duty hood struts are available from many vendors.  I've had very

	and 89 911's.  You should replace both however, since one good and one

	It's very cramped and hard to reach, but it can be done (you may need to
	be creative with tools, but no special ones are required -- just patience
	and steady hands).  The passenger side is easy.
	
	A terrific alternative to hydraulic struts is a $40 rachet-like strut sold
	by Vertex, 570 W. 39th Place, Hialeah, FL  33012 (305-556-4881).  You
	only need to buy one and it can be installed just like a normal strut on
	the passenger side in 5 minutes.  Once installed, you raise the hood,
	listen for the "click", and gently lower an inch or so to the stop.  Release
	by raising the hood all the way past the last "click" and gently lower.
	These struts are mechanical (no fluids so no leaks), and guaranteed for
	life.  They worked great on my 84 cab.  The only downside is you have to
	know how to work them, and others who might open your hood won't get
	it.  I used to leave a bold notice in plain view under the hood explaining

Subject: On 911 bonnet gas strut replacement

Automotion recently pointed out this:

    Current replacement struts are designed for recent Porsches,
    where the bonnet ends smoothly at the front.  An older 911,
    with pre-impact-resistant bumpers, has a bonnet with a 
    downward bend at the end.  The older bonnet is heavier.

Automotion then pointed out that new struts barely hold up an
old heavy bonnet when they are new, and added that they have a
supply of old-style struts designed for the older hoods.

One might even consider old-style struts with new hoods ...

	One thing you might check is the gasket on the engine breather
cover. I have seen it put on 180 degrees out and the squared off notch on
the gasket was not sealing where it should. The leak occurs at the rear of
the cover on the drivers side and does make a very large mess when the
revs are up. The blow-by coming from that hose going back to the oil tank
is substantial. I do not believe the oil tank location is the problem.
Hope this information is useful to everyone.

I replaced the starter on my 356A; I'm sure I didn't remove the engine
(that time) as I remember lying on my back and cussing a reasonable
amount.  I did have the car up on jack stands.  I remember reaching up
over the transmission with one arm and around the other way with the
other arm, kind of like giving your xmission a big greasy hug.  Then
with your third arm . . .

I think I just used a socket and ratchet wrench, but I also have some
of those flat, one-size ratchting wrenches that come in handy, like for
engine removal/install.  I will look at home to see if I made any
notes.  I do remember more problems with the replacement, as the new
unit had a slightly different terminal arrangement or a new protrusion
that got in the way, but eventually was made to work. So it IS possible.

On the other hand, since removing the engine is less than an hour,
maybe that is actually the easiest way; plus you get to really clean
out the engine bay and the engine too!  I think there is a fortune to
be made if someone could breed and train squirrels or chipmunks to
carry a wrench into tight places and put it on a nut, or to retrieve
dropped parts from the innards of things.  I cannot get my cat

Good luck.

Subject: Snow tires 2 vs. 4

When I first bought snow tires for my Honda Civic Si, I did a little
experiment.  BTW, I bought 4 (and boy, are lightweight cars nice on the
wallet -- 4 175-70-13 Vredesteins on new steel rims mounted and balanced
for $310... but I digress...).

Anyway, I tried mounting only two on the car at first just to see whether
four really made a difference.  In short, it did & I'm glad I bought four.

I tried this on both the front and rear of my FWD Civic.  The results were
as I expected.  With snows on the front only, it was very easy to get the
tail to come around -- I decided it was a little too easy for secure winter
driving.  With snows on the rear only (I had to try it!), acceleration was
difficult and I couldn't get the tail to break loose (without the parking
brake!).

My real trial was a late night trip through Vermont over the Green Mountains.
The conditions were great -- 2-3" of heavy, cold ground up snow, no ice.
I was amazed at how controllable a four wheel drift at ~65 mph could be!

Bottom line is that you will definitely have better handling and braking
with four snows.  Whether it is worth the money (I imagine they will cost
much more than mine!) depends on how you drive in the snow and whether you
are ready for that oversteer...

John,

	I would suggest you not use that many base gaskets under your
cylinders. As the cylinders heat and cool they do move a little bit and
will wear the copper gaskets, which will slowly cause the heads to
untorque and oil leaks to appear between the cylinder and head. The base
gaskets are also available in 1/2 and 1 mm thickness, use one of these
instead. 
	You should check the deck height between both banks of cylinders
and set them the same with various thicknesses of base gaskets because of
the botch job done by the machinist. 
	As far as bolting the heads and cam tower on as an assembly, that
is an exceptable practice but before you do use an machinist straight edge
across each bank of cylinders and verify they are all at the same height.
Make sure they are sitting square on the case half, I use cut lengths of
copper tubing to lightly hold each cylinder in place while I check. I set
the heads in place and install the head washers and nuts (both heavily
oiled) leaving the nuts loose while I install the cam tower. I torque the
cam tower down first then the heads. Hope this information helps.

Hi, Ted.
 
No, you don't need to remove the engine. That would take longer than getting
underneath.
 
0. Disconnect battery negative terminal.
1. Wear safety goggles. What you're going to do will dislodge all the dirt
packed up in there.
2. Jack up the back of the car so you can slide underneath. Use stands,
don't trust a jack.
3. The trick is that you have to remove the upper bolt holding the starter
from the engine compartment side. It's there behind the fan shroud on the
passenger side. It is also one of the bolts that holds in the engine. Push
the bolt out from the underside of the car.
4. Loosen the lower bolt holding the starter in.
5. Now you can wiggle the starter out.

Hi all!

Well I got the trunk hinge console welded and took my 914 out for a 27 mile
test drive. Now I know why people own these things! How exciting! No gushing
oil (I fixed that yesterday :-), no smoke, no fires, no explosions, no missing,
no non-turbo lag, no heat... Hey! There's no heat!

How much air comes out of your vents (under the dash, in the dash, and the
defrosters) when the _heating_ system is on?

When I pull back the heater control lever (the one on the floor) the fan in the
engine compartment comes on and I _think_ I can feel air coming out the vents.

When the engine is running (like 2000 RPM) there's a bit more airflow, but not
much.

I crawled under and it looks like all of the flaps are flapping, and there
doesn't seem to be any parts missing. Nothing looks rusted through. I didn't
see any nests. :-) I pulled the little "check valve" out of the fan just to
make sure it wasn't causing any trouble.

I'm not sure yet, but I think that "thermostat" bellows thingy is shot. I
haven't noticed the linkage connected to it moving any. Could that be it? A
related question: Does that thing fail in a manner that's good or bad for the
engine?

All of the fresh air stuff seems to work fine (I get all kinds of airflow).

I await your wisdom.

  On the subject of cold weather start, my 85/2-944 also exhibits some 
strange behavior. On cold day when temperature is below 0 Degree F
the car start on the first try but dies after idling for 2-3 seconds.  
After this, the only way I have been able to restart the car is to crank the
engine for over two or three min. continuously without depressing the gas
pedal. This long crank will get the engine to catch and then let go type 
behavior. It misses so badly that if don't keep the starter engaged while 
the engine is in a semi-running stage that it will die again and the whole
procedure will have to repeated, i.e. 4-5 min of constant cranking. I don't
like to abuse the starter but frustration, anger and humiliation of a P-Car
letting you down overrides the prior. 

  Last Tuesday temperature in Chicago reached a low of -25F and a high of -15F. 
I drove the car to work and it was parked there for the 12 hours. In the 
evening when I tried starting, it engine showed symptom of catching, then 
let go. I paid a guy with the generator, hoping to get the boost I needed
to get the Beast going. We abandoned the process when I started to smell 
the starter getting hot.  The short end of the story is that the car refused 
to start for the next two days as the temperature ranged between -25F to -5F.
Yesterday, the temperature got above 20F (A real heat wave :-) ) and I was
able to get the car started with the long cranking technique. 

Battery is 3-month old DieHart and seems good because I was able to start the
car after it sat in the cold for 3 days.  It seems to me that it is a gas
or mixture related problem and have the following hunch.
        
        1)  Could the fuel Injectors nozzles be freezing up. I did have
            a full tank gas, treated with a bottle of Heet. I wish that
            it was a Carb. instead of an EFI because I don't know
            where to spray the Starting fluid on an EFI?  

        2)  Does the Below Zero temperature makes the DME go brain dead and
            it does not provide the right mixture. What is a good test for 
            this? 

        3)  Could it be the O2 sensor?

Any thing else I should be aware off. This is my first winter with the
944 and wanted to know some techniques to start the car in cold weather.
Like my RX-7 needs 4 pump, half choke and a kick on the gas pedal once 
the engine start catching. I have learned this after owning the the RX-7
for the last 8 years.

Thanks,
Affie.

Subject: Re: Front Hood Struts

One of the comments made on the Hood struts, was that it has to be changed
every so often. My bitch is that both the struts on my 944 was replaced in
Sept of 93. Last week when the Siberian express passed through Chicago and
the temperature ranged between -25F to -15F (high),the struts of my hood
would not hold the bonnet up. 

I am really very disappointed with the behavior of this car in the winter.

	1) I have problem starting on very cold morning.
	
	2) Every time car is washed, the lock barrel freeze's and
	   one is essentially locked out. I have learned to cover the 
	   the lock barrel which is something that I never did for any
	   of my previous cars.

	3) On days with below Zero temperature, I avoid opening the door
	   from the inside. What happens is that the cheap plastic handle
	   on the inside of the door gets stuck in an open position and
	   makes it impossible to lock the door. It happened to me last
	   week when the car would not start. It sat for three days in
	   a public parking lot, with the door tied to the steering wheel
	   by a rope ( Brings the Porsche down to a Beater category).

	4) Even though I recently rebuild the Head lamp motor, it still
	   does not closes properly with Sub-zero temperature. 

But, once I get to drive, it sure feels good to be driving a Porsche :-) 

And one thing more, Why is there such a big gap between the hood and the
windshield on my 944. All it does is allows the snow that was wiped by the 
wipers, to blow in on top of the battery and the Fuse Box. Both are critical
units and sensitive to cold temperature. Some German Engineering! HA.

I better leave while I am ahead.

You can also purchase (Automotion, Andial, probably others) a set of mounting
hardware for the front deck lid that allows two OEM struts to be attached to
each side. My '69 (big steel lid) had a chronic failure rate of about 1 strut
per year ( I think these things die just sitting on a shelf somewhere also,
they appear to have a date code) before I made this mod. I am now using four
old (i.e. bad ) struts for more than four years with no problem. The added
tension is such that you should always use a two-handed push to lower the
deck lid, but other than that, it is a very satisfactory low-cost mod. By the

Hi, Tom.
 
I vaguely remember something like your backfiring when I owned an 81 SC.
Could it be that your oxygen sensor isn't working/is shot/isn't hooked up?
That would cause the engine to go to its rich backup mode.
 
I also recall that I disconnected some vacuum line or other in there, for
slaloms and such, and I liked the occasional pop so much that I just left it
off. But I don't remember which line it was, and the new owner of the car, a
good friend, just called up a few days ago asking where the loose hose goes

studs to stay in (install timeserts), the crank to turn freely (check line
bore), and the thing not to leak (deck spigot surface, timesert int. shaft
studs).

Installing Timeserts for the cylinder studs has been discussed everywhere by
everyone, so I won't do it again.  Line bore should be self-explainatory; if
it's not off, you don't.

The confusion now seems to be what is decking the spigots and clearancing the
cylinder bores; and what is necessary to machine.  If you put a straightedge
over the cylinder spigots (where the cylinders go in), you will find they are
off about .015" from the highest to lowest.  A machinist cuts the case flat. 
This usually entails cutting LESS than the reading because one cylinder will
have  "sunk" and another will "grown" over the engine's operating life.  So
maybe .010" is cut.  This is acceptable and it isn't going to throw anything
off.  If you're really paranoid you can use the next thicker base gasket to
compensate.

Step 2 is to make sure the bore the cylinder fits into is round.  When you
install Timeserts, drilling the stud hole larger (to fit the insert) causes a
slight deformity in the cylinder bore.  So you go in there and make a cut to
make sure it's round.

Step 3 is Timeserting the 4 longest of the 8mm studs which hold the case
halves together (int. shaft F & R, #8 main brg. upper and lower).

I have never taken a 2.7 machined like this back apart--and I have some out
there w/ a lot of miles.  CAUTION:  you can't continue to subject the thing
to absurd oil temps (230 +).

So our friend with the base gasket question probably had better confront WHY
the case isn't flat, and how far it is exactly off from factory new before
reassembly.  Any case machined only .010" isn't going to have piston/valve
interference.

2.  installation of cam housing/cylinder heads a unit.

I was told right off the bat when I did my first 911 engine (by some Bay Area
experts here, all w/ national reputations) that you put the heads on the cam
tower first, then put that assembly on the engine. I'm not saying the other
way is wrong, but that first engine I did in 1980 (when I was 18), and the
200 or so other sets of heads I've put on 911's have been done the same way.

Just an observation--if the cam tower is flat, the mating surface between it
and the back of the head is also flat, and the distance between the head
mating surface and the head sealing surface is the same, should it matter
which way you do it?

3. oil cooler upgrades

I usually put '87+ coolers on (they have the aux. fan).  Then I wire the fan
via a second relay through front A/C condenser fan wiring so it comes on
whenever the A/C is on.  I'm an A/C slave so whenever it's remotely hot it's
on, and that's the only time I see higher oil temps.  Here in the Bay Area,
though, I don't perform too many cooler upgrades on stock cars that don't go
on the track.

Pete,

Koni shocks are usually orange.  Boges and Bilsteins are either black

P.S. If you put Koni's on your 912, use the lightest setting to start with.

What follows is a brief article I wrote for our local newsletter some
time ago.  Works for me; I was crazy enough to wash my car outdoors
last weekend when the temp was about zero F!  Rubber gloves and a hot
water hook-up for ther garden hose are key.


Alarm Locks 

I had a problem with my car's factory alarm lock freezing in 
cold weather.  There is a black plastic "gate" in the key 
slot, whose job it is to slide back and forth, sealing the 
slot and the lock mechanism from the elements when the key 
is removed.  The gate was not blocking my car's key slot, 
and that let water in which would freeze. 

The cause turned out to be pretty simple.  After six years 
of continuous use, I had tapped the metal face of the lock 
enough times to bend it in ever so slightly around the edges 
of the key slot.  The slight bend on two edges of the slot 
was enough to keep the gate from travelling freely.  A few 
minutes gently prying back the metal face with a jeweller's 
screwdriver, and the problem was solved. 

I would recommend using a good lubricant in the lock 
mechanism, one which will inhibit entry of water.  Using a 
"lock de-icer" spray or liquid, which is typically alcohol-
based, very effectively removes any lubricants in the lock, 
almost guaranteeing that the lock with freeze right up 
again. 

Porsche has a jelly lubricant for door and alarm locks, part 
number 999.917.751.00, and a ten gram tube of it lists for 
$1.50.   Good stuff, but I wish they had thought through the 
applicator a bit better.  The neck of the tube really isn't 
thin enough to get deep into a lock.  I tamped the jelly 
into my alarm lock by breaking a Q-tip in half and using the 
shaft.  A wooden coffee stirrer would probably work too.  I 
like Porsche's jelly better than spray lubricants because it 
creates a better barrier to moisture. 

By the way, when you wash your Porsche in cold weather (or 
any car for that matter), putting a small square of duct 
tape over each key slot will help keep water out of them.

Lubricate!  Invest in a can of Wurth HHS-2000, which is especially nice
in that it penetrates, then dries to leave the lubricant.  I am not sure
what would cause the inside handle to stick.  What I do is remove the
philips head screw in the door jamb.  This lets you pull the handle
mechanism out enough to shoot some of its inner workings.  Of course,
also get the mechanism mounted on the door jamb itself.

Because that's the gap through which fresh air passes into the car,
through the fresh air blower under the shrouding.  Not sure about pre-85.5
cars, but the later ones have a weather-tight lid on the central electrics.
And the battery really doesn't mind a little water or snow on it.  In
fact, good venting keeps any acid fumes from doing the nasty to your
bodywork.

Never seen rain or snow blow into that area with the car in motion.

If the engine turns over (wuh-wuh-wuh) at a more or less normal rate,
you battery is fine.  By the way, there's another reason not to crank it
too long: the fuel pump.  It is cooled only by fuel flowing through it,
and if fuel doesn't flow (because the line is frozen, your tank is empty,
etc.), you can easily smoke the pump.

No idea what Heet is.  As a last resort, a single dose of isopropyl alcohol
("dry gas") is OK.  Yes, you could have frozen lines.  You could also have
marginal flow due to a clogged fuel filter.  When did you change it last?

DME no, but there is an engine temp sender whose job it is to let the DME
know to enrich the charge.  However, if you car starts and runs fine when
it is a little warmer out, I would not suspect the engine temp sender.

>        3)  Could it be the O2 sensor?

No.  The O2 (lambda) sensor is only useful when it is up to operating
temperature.  For that reason, it is ignored during start-up.

I don't know what your problem is.  But, hey, an engine needs only a few
things to run: fuel, air, spark, and compression.  You're unlikely to have
suddenly lost compression, so look at the other three.

Fuel: After replacing Mr. Filter and then unsuccessfully trying to start
the car, remove a spark plug.  Is it damp with fuel?  Stick you nose down
the spark plug bore - can you smell fuel?  If the answer is no, then
something is wrong between the gas tank and the injectors.

(When you replace the fuel filter, have a glass jar (peanut butter size)
handy.  Invert the old one into it, inlet fitting down.  Let the fuel drain
then sit overnight.  See what precipitates/separates out, esp. dirt and
water.  If so, find a better gas station.)

Air: Check the air filter for reasonable cleanliness.  Not really key, but
getting it out of the way lets you also check the air flow meter's barn
door for sticking and free play.  Try starting the car again, and see
whether the door moves a friend cranks, indicating air flow.

Spark: Take that plug out again, and lean it so the tip is in proximity
to a grounded metal part.  Take your hand away.  Have that friend crank
again, and see that you get spark.  No spark could mean a number of things,
including a bad or misdjusted speed/reference mark sensor (separate senders
on 16-valve cars, single sender for eight-valvers).  They do tend to be
temperature-sensitive.

Well, a bunch of pretty basic stuff to check for.  There are more unusual
things which could be wrong with your car, but I'd start with these.  Hope
this helps; let me know.

Subject: 3.0 Backfires - K-Jetronic

My note from yesterday has been solved. Rev/Min transducer is built into
the distributor. The Tach was reading incorrectly and upon dis-assembly and
a few drops of WD40, it is now fully resetting to the correct idle position
after
acceleration. However, I have still now solved my problem - which is back
firing.

1. New dist cap and rotor.
2. Timing 5 btdc, hoses disconnected, idle 950 rpm
3. old plug wires ( Beck/Arnley 37.00/ Bosch 350.00 , other 80.00)
        *Comments on $$ diff PLEASE !

Now here's my understanding of K-Jetronof vertical rise of the control plunger as the
sensor plate rises 

3. On cold start - Lambda thermo switch on the valve covers sends a closed
signal, which causes the brain to send a slightly rich duty-cycle signal to
the 
lambad control valve ( located behind the air flow sensor on the incoming
fuel line. This is open loop.

4. When warm, the system switches to closed loop, with a duty cycle being
generated based on the input of the lambda sensor ( aka oxygen sensor).
Closed
loop.

So with all that in mind, I reallym of the coil - the book said to connect to (-) ???? Strange. I used
this set-up for my dwell readings - dwell is supposed to change when you
connect/disconnect the oxygen sensor - yet per my experiences I saw none.
It seems from my book readings that Lambda only helps to fine tune
mixtures, so perhaps I am chasing the wrong thing. I did lean down the
mixture screw - yet really made no diff in the backfirings -

        Any K-Jetronic w/ Lambda experts out there. Next week I have to play
with poor idle on Motronic.....

Subject: 944 as an All Season Porsche


I would like to share my experiences of using a 944 as an all season car
and invite other opinions and experiences relating to the Porsche as a
winter sports car.

Since I live in Ottawa, Canada, I need to drive in all kinds of weather.
We have a good three months of heavy snowfall, icy roads and temperatures
that rarely rise above the freezing point of water.

Most people I know with sports cars, and *all* the people I know with
Porsches put their summer sports cars away for the winter. Although this
is the rational thing to do with many cars, my 944 is an exception.  It is
an 1985/2 that I bought two years ago.  One of requirements I had while
shopping for my next car was that I wanted a car that I could drive all
year 'round.  In the following sections I will describe the qualities of
the 944 that make is a suitable winter car, the advantages and
disadvantages of using the 944 as an all season car and some of my
experiences.

Qualities
=========
The particular car that I bought was, in my opinion, near the bottom of
its depreciation curve.  Winter driving would not lower its value that
much.  It was not exactly in concours condition, but it was not in bad
shape either.  Although it had more than a few stone chips and dings, there
was no rust on the car. 

The 1985/2 944s and most Porsches built in the past 15 years use
galvanized steel to prevent rust.  I reinforce this rust resistance with an
application of anti-rust spray every Fall and by washing the car once a
week.  In addition to the 944's DME fuel injection, the excellent heater,
heated rear window, heated side mirrors and heated windshield washer
nozzles contribute to making the car a user-friendly winter vehicle.

In the area of traction, the near 50/50 weight distribution of the 944
inspires confidence with its neutral handling along with the giddy feeling
of controlled oversteer on a snowy road.  I install snow performance 
tires in the winter and conventional performance tires in the summer.
Compared to the compromise of all season tires, I get the best possible
tire performance in the summer *and* in the winter.

Advantages
==========
There are a number of advantages to driving a 944 through the winter.
While the fun of shocking other sports cars enthusiasts can't be
understated there are some more tangible benefits.  More seat time each
year means getting to know the characteristics of a fine car even better -
especially its behavior at its limits of traction.  The cool, dense winter
air means more HP as the engine electronics automatically take advantage
of this mild supercharging effect.  The fun of driving a Porsche does not
have to be limited to the fair weather months. 

There are financial advantages as well.  I only have to own one car, rather
than a summer car and a winter car.  This means that one of the highest
cost of car ownership - depreciation - is not multiplied by a factor of
two.  Additionally, the capital that might be tied up in buying that second
car for the winter could be more wisely used to finance *appreciating*
investments (or to pay off debts).  Driving the 944 all year also means
that spending all of the automobile budget on the Porsche doesn't mean
having to drive a winter-junker for half the year.  Having only one car also
saves on the cost of storage fees and the repairs to any damage that may
occur during storage.

Disadvantages
=============
To be absolutely honest, there are a couple of disadvantages to winter
driving a Porsche.  No matter how well the car is protected and maintained
during the winter, it definitely does lower the resale value of the car.
But I believe that this extra bit of depreciation is more than offset by
the financial savings mentioned above.  The second disadvantage, and the
one that hits closer to home, is the fact that the car can't really have
its performance enhanced too much.  Lowering the suspension and installing
specialized computer chips are out of the question.

Experiences
===========
This is my second winter of driving the 944 and I have no regrets. Although
almost all of my winter experiences with the car have been great, there
have been a couple very minor mechanical problems.  I have found that both
the door locks and the rear hatch latches are very susceptible to freezing.
It probably has something to do with my weekly car washes in sub-freezing
weather.  The freezing in the door locks is easily prevented by regular
applications of WD40 inside the mechanisms.  The rear hatch latches not
only needed WD40, but I also had to loosen the fastening nuts and to lock
the nuts in place with some LocTite.

The second mechanical problem I've had is a stuck throttle.  A couple of
times last winter I found my self having to deal with a Prosche engine
bouncing between redline and the rev limiter while trying to control a
fish-tailing car on a slippery road.  The solution to this one is cleaning
the throttle body.  I found that a black substance builds up on the edges
of the butterfly valve and on the walls of the throttle body where the
valve makes contact.  Once again, a little WD40 helps to keep things moving
freely.

In summary, I would not say that winter driving has added to the cost of
ownership of my 944 but it has definitely added to my enjoyment of the
car. And finally, I would not recommend this for all Porsches, especially
those with the potential for significant depreciation (or the tendency to
swap ends!)

Now, what I am really waiting for is the day when I have a great
four-wheel-drive sports car for the winter and a highly modified 911 for
the summer.

Subject: Re:911SC Weird Idle






Is your engine a K-jet injection? (might also apply to l-Jet as well).

If so I have the same problem. It appears that the problem is that 
the injectors bleed and then partially vapour lock when  you turn
the engine off. That is the heat from the engine "cooks" the gas
in the injector lines, and then 

1. forces the fuel out of the injectors (causing flooding when warm).

2. Causes a partial vapour lock in the line thus preventing full fuel
  flow. The reason that only a few cylinders work is basically due 
to different injector line lengths.

Solns (not my own)

1.  Change injectors (the springs evidently go weak allowing the bleed.)
   Also the spray pattern is poor.

2.  Fit a cooling fan to blow cool air across the injector heads for 
10 mins after the engine has been turned off.... So Audi's already

I'm having a problem with my '81 911SC.  The engine idles fine when cold
or at operating temperatures.  But after the engine is off and sits for a 
few minutes to a couple of hours after a trip,  it seems as if it is 
idling on 3 cylinders and sputters when I try to drive off.  The problem 
seems to goes away once I get the car rolling around 2000 rpm or 
back to operating temperatures.  Does anyone have any idea what 
the problem may be?   

Thanks in advance.

Thanks for the response ken. The issue of why the spigot height on 4-5 and

can conclude is that the machinist did a bad job. I should take it completely
down and start at square one but I am in the fortunate position of having
a spare case so I think i'm going to reassemble the top ends using multiple
gaskets (i already bought) and start a fresh on the second case. Ken
what should i expect to pay to have a case prepared as you discribed? Does
anyone know what the clearance between the inlet valve and piston should be?

Why do the 74-77 2.7s stock run so hot? How does the 87+ cooler compare with
after maket cooler solutions? I have tried fabricating my own cooler from two
after market VW coolers in parallel in place of the front loop (only partially

The motor mount I removed from my 1985/2 944 was a non-turbo unit. The

Subject: First WINTER with P-car

I have been directed by the forces of nature to hibernate my 911 (86').
As you know we had the "coldest" weather in Philadelphia for the last
100 years (I think).

I prepared for a short storage (unheated garage) doing the following:

1. inflated the tires to 50 psi 
2. trickle charge (auto-off) the battery 
3. cycle battery (electrical) drain
4. plan to change the oil and fill the tank with gas to displace any moisture.
5. roll the car once a week (you know why)
6. run the engine at "high" RPM's

On my last inspection I noticed few OIL spots. My first impression is that it 
was from the "Oil-Return" tubes.  Confirmed when I was changing the oil.

Cut to the chase... OK!
 
Is it normal for the seal O-rings (I assume these are made from silicone) to
"shrink" from the severe temperature DROP and thereby leak??
 Note: NO leaks were observed prior to the VERY low temperature (- 7 oF).

Are there kits to replace the oil-return tubes without disturbing the exhaust
headers (i.e. expandable type) ? 

Many thanks in advance.

Randy,

Don't they salt thr roads in Canada? Here in central New York we get so 
much snow that the roads are always being "paved" with a mixture of salt 
and rather large dia. gravel. 

Guess what happens when you follow someone in your Porsche? Every car 
I've ever driven here in winter has become chipped badly on the front and 
underside of the car by the gravel. Cracked windows are common when 
forced to follow large trucks kicking up the stones.

When the salt lays in these chipped areas rust is on the way.

I've noticed that the amt. of salt used in other states/provinces is much 
less and the grade of gravel more like sand. Is this what they use up 
north?

For years I've bitched that a good set of snow tires on packed powder 
gives as good traction as a slippery slushy snow/salt mixture w/o the 
drawbacks.

The bottom line is that driving a nice car here in the winter is 
guaranteed suicide for it. 

Just my 2 cents.

I've had two similar problems which might help you, Pakam.

Kevin Gross' excellent suggestions basically tell the story; with the 
right combination of air, fuel, and spark, you'll have a running motor. 
 Keep this fundamental rule in mind when diagnosing your motor's problem.

I had a problem with a *very* difficult-to-start motor, which turned 
out to be bad spark plug wires.  Very hard to diagnose, and expensive 
to replace, but they're often the cause of sporadic misfiring when all 
seems well.  High humidity / wet locations worsens this, as does high 
rpm (higher average voltage trying to leak from the wires).  I've even 
seen "good" end caps (at sparkplug) let a blue arc go right through 
themselves and ground (earth) to the head.

Second, I had a K-Jetronic car that virtually wouldn't start without 
excessive cranking, and wouldn't idle.  Higher RPM's were OK.  Problem 
turned out to be a vacuum leak.  Finding a vacuum leak isn't always 
easy, what with all the tubes running around.  Look for fractured 
lines, rubbing areas, cracked vacuum hoses, a defective one-way valve 
to your brake booster (little black/blue thing in the wiring harness at 
the top edge of the firewall) and so on.

I hope this helps!  Good luck finding the problem,

The old muffler, and the connections between it and the J tubes, on my

  Hello Bob,
  Welcome to the net.
  er, uh..i'm about to belch wisdom.
  -New at 914's eh?  Welcome to the fray.
  Ok, 914's have heating systems only marginally better than VW super beetles.
  Reason for this is the length of the heat exchanger AND a blower assist.
  All 914's have a central engine cooling fan, it is mounted to the crank.
  The faster you drive, the more air is forced thru the motor and heating
ducts.  The blower assist is on the cold inlet side of the exchangers.
  To keep you from roasting in the summer, there are cable-controlled valves
(a pair) that control the amount and direction of the hot flow.  In summer
the flow is directed to outside the car.  Air flows thru this system %100 
of the time (well, its supposed to anyway).  Problems with this system is
mostly related to rust outs, shot connecting hoses, or missing parts.
  You can expect a low airflow from this system, nothing like american 
hardware with a 3 or 4 speed fan to blow on your feet.

  The spec for the cooling system on a 914 is something like 2000 liters of
air per minute to cool the cylinders, which resemble motorcycle heads and
are hidden from easy view by sheet metal shrouding/ducting.  The bellows
and cable assembly are a very simple 'fast warm-up' device.  The bellows
do not move very much, and the cable it controls is in turn connected to
a flap within the fan housing.  The purpose of this arrangement is to cause
less air flow to cylinders on that bank (#1&2) and force a quicker warmup
because that is the side that has the head temp sensor used by the ECU, if
your car still has the injection.  There is another flap on the other side
of the motor (on a common shaft) that controls the airflow across the oil
cooler (all 914's have this) in a similar manner.  The trip point of the 
bellows is (if memory serves) 37C, and moves nary a 0.125 inch.

  From your words, sounds like you got good airflow.
  Having heat is another issue.  These can defog better than a beetle,
maybe defrost some, if you give it lots of time.  They just wont thaw
out too well on a day when its below 10F.  Nature of the beast.

  Hope i didnt get too much on you...and it was of use.

  If you need more specifics, ask.

>- Stan

You just have to turn the car on its side!

Seriously, leakdown and compression tests are very reliable on
boxer engines. If there's a major difference from cylinder to
cylinder, the first thing I would check is the most obvious:
Were the conditions *exactly* the same for each one -- same
number of cranks, and butterflies open. If you put your foot all
the way down on the gas pedal for one cylinder and forget to do
it for the next, the difference in compression may "appear" to be
30-50 pounds. With a leakdown tester, if you forget to zero the
gauge before hooking it up from cylinder to cylinder, it can 
"appear" to be very high.

If you double check the numbers and there's still a big difference, 
even on a newly rebuilt engine, there's a problem - like someone didn't
stagger the rings correctly. Mahle pistons and cylinders don't take
much breaking-in, as evidenced by the fact that Porsche sticks new
engines right on a dyno and runs them up to redline!

I personally wouldn't trust anybody else's numbers - and I always
double check my own.

Just so there is no confusion, I believe that the inherent difficulty
in bleeding the 944 clutch stems from the angle of the master cylinder,
not the slave cylinder. The angle of the master cylinder is such that
there is an air pocket at the front corner. The real design flaw in my
opinion is that the line to the slave cylinder is connected at the
center of the front of the master cylinder, not to the top of the front 
of the cylinder, where any trapped air would be carried down to
the slave cylinder and out of the bleeder. The "get the rear as high
as you can" technique works, by making the air bubble move to the
top back corner, where the feed from the reservoir is connected. Thus
some "reverse bleeding" can help once the back is high. I would not
squirt fluid in through the bleeder, as someone suggested, due to
dirt. However, it is possible to manually extend and contract the
slave cylinder without touching the clutch pedal (it needs to be in
the up position, however, to uncover the port to the reservoir). This
pushes fluid in the master cylinder back up to the reservoir, and
takes the air with it, if the back of the car is high enough to move
the bubble to the back of the master cylinder. You clearly need enough
"stroke" on the slave cylinder to get the bubble all the way to the
reservoir, or you will just pull the bubble back into the master
cylinder with  the reverse stroke. Now that I think about it, I don't
remember exactly how I created the opposite direction of motion,
since the actuating rod for the clutch is not anchored to the piston
in the slave cylinder. I may have used the clutch pedal to pump the
slave cylinder full (with the actuating rod positioned so it doesn't
act on the throwout lever entering the bellhousing), and then used
the actuating rod to push on the piston, forcing fluid back to the
reservoir, along with the bubble.

The key issue is "bubble management". Draw yourself a picture, mental
or otherwise, of where there is likely to be a bubble, based on the
geometry and location of tube fittings, etc, and then think through a 
technique which will get the bubble to free air (top of the reservior
or the bleed nipple).

BTW, I know of no place in brake systems, Porsche or otherwise, where
you need to go through this kind of bubble management exercise.

I recall many ago when a number of 240 and

heated up causing the fuel to "cook", which resulted
in starting problems when the engine was hot.

Datsun's fix was to wrap the lines with a foil like

It worked on my 240.

Glad to see you stuck with it and got the thing running.

On the subject of heater airflow:
1.check to make sure the flapper valves located on each heat 
exchanger are opening up completely when you pull the red heater
knob all the way up. If not, adjust the cables, but be carefull that you
don't get them too tight or they won't close.
2. Airflow is not that great anyway until you reach about 3000rpm.
3. the flow seems less restricted if you direct all the heat down
    (heat air control knob all the way to the left)
4. the thermostat bellow and flaps were removed on my car so this 
is probably why the airflow is low on my car.
5. Make sure the thermostat flaps are stuck open, or you will burn up
your engine. you should get this checked.

Subject: 928 water pump outcome: it aint pretty but works!

howdy folks;

	some of you will remember that i was replacing a water pump on my
'79 928 and broke a bolt off, then i broke an extractor off in it. i 
did a bunch of
research, made 40 bazillion phone calls, got laughed at a bit, and then plunged
ahead.

	it turns out that the only surefire way of solving this problem is to have
the hole cleaned out using an EDM machine. i found a place here in seattle who
could do it for me, but only if i could bring him the block, so he 
could mount it
on the table of the machine. no in-car work. ouch. depending on the 
condition of
the hole when he gets done (i.e. how badly i've mangled it up so far 
:-0 ), it will
then probably have to be timesert'ed, but i expected that.

	anyway, since this engine is going come out of the car in the next 2 years
anyway (for general cleanup, oil leak fixing, and probably a valve 
job), i just put the
water pump back on with one 12 bolts, instead of 13. i made sure the 
surface was
clean and dry, and used some gasket sealer to ensure that it didn't slip during
assembly, and it seems to be working fine. i've driven the thing about 
150 miles
(about 10 heat cycles), and its dry.

	i'm not real pleased with the solution, and it probably offends some
of the purists out there, but, what the hey.  many thanks to everyone for
the suggested solutions.

The open/closed specs should make sense if they are referred to
1mm from the completely closed position.

The numbers should work out if you adjust the rockers for 0.004" clearance
at TDC, then as the cam is rotated, the valve is defined as open when the 
valve is moved off the valve seat by 1mm = .04", the valve is defined as
closed when it returns to the same 1mm spec on the closing cycle.

    Just purchased a 1990 Honda CRX si.  Both hood struts need replacement.  So
much for Japan.
    Maybe the long-lasting Japanese struts were environmentally hazardous, or
didn't crumple with the crumple-zones, or stupid people were taking them off
and hurting themselves with them.  Or maybe they just didn't weigh enough.

>Stan

Stan, I believe the problem is with the particular strut application,
not the strut (gas spring) being of German or Japanese origin.  

So your conclusion that Japanese gas springs are superior to German gas 
springs could be wrong.

Caution: long winded explanation follows.

Taken from my previous post

>My guess is the Porsche factory tried higher pressure struts and
>the hood fit was unacceptable.  So they kept dropping the pressure 
>until the hood fit was acceptable.  So there isn't a lot of margin for 
>normal strut leakdown and cold temperatures.

The factory could install higher initial pressure gas springs, but there
would be more stress on the hood in the closed position, lifting the
rear of the hood somewhat when closed.

As mentioned before by another poster, if you don't have AC, the rear 911 lid
gas spring will last a long time.  Like the front hood springs, it is also
gradually losing pressure, but it probably initially exceeds the minimum
holding force by a wider margin.

The rear gas spring is the same technology as the front spring, same 
manufacturer, but a different application on the same car.

If anyone is interested, here is a rough description of the operation
of a gas spring.

The spring design is conceptually simple, a cylinder pumped to a high pressure
and then plugged with a sliding plug.   

For those that might not be familiar with the gas law.

  P = nRT/V

  P = absolute pressure 
  n = Number of Moles of gas in the cylinder (k* number of gas molecules)
  R = gas constant
  T = absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin, 0 degrees C = 273 degrees K
  V = internal volume in cylinder after subtracting piston displacement

  Output force (with gas spring located in a vacuum) = 
       (Piston cross-section area) * nRT/V

  The actual force is decreased by atmospheric pressure when on the car,
  ~14.7 lbs*cross-sectional area.

  The Piston is the polished rod that slides into the gas spring.

  The output force is then dependent on 

  1. n decreasing as the gas leaks past the seal
  2. Temperature
  3. Volume changes as the piston is depressed.

One can verify the design by drilling a small bleed hole in a junk
gas spring and then cutting it open with a hacksaw.  

I did this several years ago.

As an EE, it's a stretch to comment on pneumatic design, but as I see it, 
the critical design problem of the gas spring is the high pressure seal.

The gas spring manufacturer has to make a seal that will withstand ~600 psi
internal pressure, for years, with a polished metal rod sliding on it.
The seal also has to work over a wide temperature range.

In my estimation, no mean trick.

The Japanese may have a better seal technology, but I don't see
how that can be inferred from applications in other cars.  

A fairer test would be to measure a sample of new Japanese gas springs
and new German gas springs designed for the same application.  Then
re-measure them after a few years of use.

The Japanese applications may simply have more tolerance for normal leakdown 
than the 911 hood application does.

Assuming seal leakage is a given, there are a number of ways to compensate
for it.  Among them are larger cylinder displacement, higher initial pressure, 
or possibly even heating the gas springs.

As with many design decisions, there are tradeoffs with each of these
options.

For example, a larger cylinder would make the gas spring have a lower 
fully closed force, since the % volume change in the cylinder would be 
lower as the rod is fully depressed.

I'm sure you could build another type of motor mount - the stock one's
mounting points are pretty simple.  I would guess that a rubber/neoprene
block might be to stiff since the stock unit is designed to work like a
hydraulic shock absorber.  I'm sure that you could get a dead one from
your local dealer if you want to experiment.

The turbo mount has gone through 3 revisions I know of.  The latest 
ones look pretty substantial compared to the earlier ones, and have 
more metal on the outside, and are much more expensive than the earlier revs.

The non-turbo mount has been revised too, but I don't know the history 
with them.  Generally, when one fails, the advice is to upgrade to the 
latest turbo unit.

Maybe another P-netter has the actual part #; a Porsche dealer can also 
give you the correct number to double-check with.

I've never heard this - it's very interesting!  I hope they added that 
you *MUST* reconnect the alternator before trying to start the car, or 
you'll likely blow the guts out of anything electronic that's turned on 
(alarm, radio, DME, etc.).  The battery is a filter for the 
alternator's wild output.  (This would be for the case where you use an 
external power source or roll-start, with the car's battery 
disconnected from the charging circuit).

I have a trickle charger (50-100 mA) that's plugged in all winter.  
Works like a charm - the battery stays at 12.5-13 VDC but doesn't boil 
dry, etc.  No timer involved.

Every part of Canada has a different policy on salt.  Some areas are too
warm to need it and other are too cold for it to work!  In Ottawa they use
a mixture of coarse salt and fine sand.

I'm shocked to hear that they use gravel in New York.  That seems like it

I use touch-up paint on any stone chips that appear on my car.  So far,
none of them have started to rust.

In climates like Ottawa's, the salt forms a layer of brine on the road
that prevents ice from forming.  During the first snowfall this winter the
city tried to save money by not salting the road - hoping that it would
just melt.  Since there was no salt on the road, an inch-thick layer of
ice formed on the road that lasted for weeks.

I wouldn't say its suicide, but it does mean having to get the car
repainted every five years or so if you want the car to keep looking good.

Subject: Re: Alternator/Charge?

The recommendation that you disconnect the battery is probably made
because you will immediately smoke the alternator's diodes if you connect
the charger with reversed polarity.  You may also smoke the voltage
regulator.  And, in a DME car, you will destroy the DME.  This happens
more often than you might think, from what I see.

Even if you do get the polarity right, it is a good thing to protect the
DME, etc., from voltage spikes which you may get from a charger,
particularly a cheaper one with poor regulation.

Porsche always recommends a low-current charge.  If you have, for example,
a Sears charger with a two and a ten amp settings, use the lower one if
at all possible.

Not sure if this is what you mean, but I recall compressing the slave's

No, you don't really need that thing. It's a magnetic wrench used to stick
to the top through-bolts that hold the engine and trans together. The right
side through bolt goes through the engine, trans bell housing, and through
the starter flange. That's the one you may be having difficulty with. The
lower bolt through the starter flange is readily visible and obvious. The
upper one is the trick. I never felt a need for the funny magnetic wrench.

The current talk about hood shocks reminded me of the replacement of ours

Sounds like you have lots of options.  Depends on what you want to do with the
car.  I would tend to favor the 87-88 models since they have the G-50 tranny
and shift a lot more reliably than the earlier ones.  I have a friend who has
an 86, and I can never seem to find 3rd gear.  I would be very wary of anything
that has been repaired, even repainted.  You never know how extensive the
damage is.  I would recommend trying to minimize miles, even if you have to
shell out more green.  It is a good idea to check service records to see
whether there has been regular maintenance, and whether certain things -- like
air conditioning - - have required frequent maintenance.  A well maintained
higher mileage car may have fewer problems that a neglected one with fewer
miles.  Good luck!

  when starting. Once I get it started it runs fine and I will not have
  any starting problems unless it sits for more than 3 hours. It seems that
  any variations in the weather and temp will effect starting conditions.
  
  Here is a few examples on how I start the car.
    FIRST TIME START - crank engine for a second,then stop pull throttle about
     (In Morning)       half way and it will probably start.

    AFTERNOON START -  crank engine- dont use throttle or gas pedal. 
    (TEMP > 85 deg)    (2- Ourfathers   3 - Hailmarys)  8>)

    AFTERNOON START -  crank engine - starts but dies. hit gas pedal ONCE
    (TEMP 45 - 55 deg) and will start most of the time.
  
  IF I dont use the above techniques the car won't START. I know this sounds a
  little crazy but I've taken the car in for tires,bodywork and people could
  *NOT* start it.

  I have owned the car for a year and have taken it in to my local shop about
  3 times for this problem. 

  1st time - replaced injector seals.
  2nd time - tested and adjusted injection system.
  3rd time - adjusted micro-switch for cold start.

  They claim the injection system is ok and the problem is that it's one of the
  first CIS injected cars and they all have this problem. (mfg date 02/73)

  Is there *ANYTHING* I can do to fix this problem? 
  Is there any way to install a later version of CIS on this car?
  Anybody have any Ideas?
   
  Thanks,
  Doug Duncan

Subject:      All Season Pcars

In support of Randy Evans' _horrifying_ abuse of a defenseless 944 ;-)
I too keep my Pcar on the road all winter -an '81 931. It handles just
great in the slop actually. I abused it like this when I lived in upstate
NY, and continue to torture it up here in Kingston :^)
THE CAR DESERVES IT!!!   ;-)   What's the point of a galvanized body if
you don't even get it wet? ;^)  I have not found it necessary to install
snow tires on the thing yet either and I still surprise all the locals
up here in their assortment of 4 wheel drive trucks and so on when I pull
up alonside them :^)   Not to say it wouldn't be easier to get around with
snow tires but it isn't too bad without them.
Face it. NO CAR is designed to flawlessly face up to the severe winter we
are coping with now. The $931  hasn't really had any winter related
failures that I wouldn't have had on any other car so I can't complain. And
I can't believe I'm saying this, inviting the wrath of the Pcar gods, but
it hasn't let me down wrt starting on a cold morning yet. I think I'm the
only one on our street that hasn't had to call for the hook this winter ;-)

If it is at all possible, ie. the garden hose doesn't freeze up before the
water gets to the end, I wash the car weekly to keep the salt off of it.
It has very few stone chips in it. The ones that are there mostly appeared
in the summer. It has zero rust. (Except for the battery tray which isn't
connected to winter driving) Yes, the hatch is frustrating to keep ice free.
I use a combination of WD40 and applications of a hair dryer, to live
with that annoyance :^)  I will try to get some of the special goop Kevin
recommended when I have the opportunity. It sounds like good sense.

The power difference found when the air temp drops to the arctic range,
is *very* noticeable. Course it doesn't mean much when the roads are
slick with ice and slop ;-)
Bottom line is that winter driving sucks. It is hard on _any_ vehicle.
But I can't justify having a special car for winter while I am going to
school, and besides, I'd rather drive the $931, inspite of many of it's
infuriating weaknesses, than any other *winter worthy* car. ;-)
Furthermore, when I was at the local repair shop,  on one of the worst days,
the place was completely backed up with Volvo's and Saabs -commonly
ooohed and aaawed for their designed in Sweden with real winter driving in
mind status, that wouldn't start. period. Now if only the clutch hydraulics
could tolerate this cold ;-)
        Cheers gang. I HATE winter. ken.

     Hot start problems on the CIS may be;

     1. Your accumulator is bad; its whole job is to keep pressure on
        the fuel lines after you shut off the motor to avoid vapor-lock.
        
     2. Your fuel pump is bad. Esp. on my '75 911 with the fuel pump at
        the rear, heat was causing bad/no hot starts and cutting out
        when hot, replacement fixed the problem.

      You shouldn't have to do any inventing (i.e. wrapping lines, etc).
      When was the fuel pump replaced last ? Is it noisy ?

Subject: G50 heat problems



Since the car was new, the G50 tranny, or at least the shift linkage,
in my RS America binds up while trying to place it in gear from neutral
with the car at a standstill and engine temperature slightly higher 

than normal.  I asked the service department at the dealership about it
and was told that others have experienced this as well and that 

synthetic gear lube is NOT the way to go.  Has anybody else had a similar
problem with their G50's?  If I double-clutch before the car comes to 

a stop, it goes in fine, as is the case when the engine is running in the
lower end of the temperature range.  The oil temperature indicator is 

in the exact middle of the gauge.

Hard to do for a street car. For a track car, part of the trick is
that you're going to go through the gearbox after every race anyway, 
so that you get to replace all the poor tired bearings and synchros
as they're dying, not after. But then, with a pump and external
oil cooler, and a spray bar setup (sprying cooled gear goo right in
the critical parts), you might be OK. Lessee... pumps are like $2k each
from Vasek Pollack, coolers are hard to find, but you can use anything
that's the right size and pressure rating, so let's say $200 there,
and the case mods for a spray bar setup are probably in the $1k range,
plus you'll want to rebuild the whole thing "while you're in there".
Call it $5k, I'd say.  Oh, you'll also want a new higher pressure
clutch, so add another $500-750 for that, depending on what you use.
More if the flywheel is significantly different...

Plus the 3.6 and whatever it takes to install it.

>2. Get a G50 tranny and put the 3.6L and G50 in the car.

Bad move, thanks for playing. You have to install the G50 torsion
bar housings and bars. This is *DEFINITELY* not a home installation
job -- I don't know of anyone who has successfully done it. When I was
helping Haas Fogle build his car (which, alas, was utlimately turned
into Scott Jessen's blowout parts garage sale...) even Bruce Anderson
allowed as how you *should* be able to do it, but couldn't assist us
in finding anyone who had actually done the deed. Instead, we decided to
cut the tube to clear the G50 and use rear coil-overs instead.

So, if you do that you get to strip the interior of the car so that you can 
cut and weld under it without setting the interior on fire, do the fab
work, buy a good rebuilt G50 and set of coil-overs, put everything back
like it used to be, and then spend roughly forever tuning your suspension
to where it works right  -- you could probably get away with only spending
about $4k. Oh damn, I forgot -- you'll need a new clutch here too...

>So, besides buying the 3.6L and possibly a tranny, what must I
>do and how much would it cost?

And there's plan #3: build a hotter 3.0 (or similar, on a 3.0 case..)

Oh, there's another problem: the 3.6 weighs a lot more than the 3.0
you have now. So you'll get to re-tune your suspension *anyway* since
you'll have to either re-index your torsion bars or get heavier bars
or maybe both, over time....

Oh, and plan #4: get a late model car. At least you can finance that...

Smog.
(I was going to leave it there, but . . .)

    It seems that the way (or one of the ways) that the factory and/or the US
EPA came up with to reduce emissions on the 2.7 (especially the later ones) was
to make the engine run hotter, and thus more completely burn the gasoline. 
Upgrading to the better (11-blade?) fan, and *YANKING OFF THE DAMN THERMAL
REACTORS* if you have them helps, and (if I remember correctly) is now
smog-legal in a number of places.
    Also, the 2.7's make a bit more power than the case can handle (IMHO).  The
case was designed for the 2.0L engines, and may not have been set up to deal
with the extra heat from the extra HP.  More power means more heat.

Subject: 924S Coolent in Oil!!


Fellow waterpumpers-

Background:
A few months back I asked for the wisdom of this list in aiding the
installation/removal of the worn engine in exchange for a used (i.e. new
to me engine).  The good news is- after about a month of persistence the
"new" engine is installed and starts and runs!  The bad news is- prior to
intial start up I checked the oil level and noticed it was WAY to high.  

I reasoned maybe the engine had its oil topped off when it was in storage at
a unatural angle!  I decided it made good sense to change it.  When I
unscrewed the drain plug I was shocked to see about a half gallon of
COOLENT come out followed by the second "layer" of engine oil.

I should probably note that this engine was from a rolled '87 944.  Since
it was in a wreck the engine SHOULD be ok.  Also note that the engine
oil/coolent mixture that was drained didn't appear to be that nasty
greenish-brownish milky gunk that is usually associated with a blown head
gasket.  If anything it drained first pure coolent then pure engine oil 

The following morning I called the wrecking yard and explained what I had
observed.  He came back with a borderline excuse that sometime the way the
engines are stored or the way the wreck happened allow coolent to get in
the crankcase.  I played along a said I would change the oil before
starting the engine.

After changing the oil I took out the spark plugs and cranked the engine for
a good 30sec - hoping to get some partial oil pressure in an engine that
has not been run in who knows how long!

After reinstalling the plugs I started the engine and it sounded awful
(lots of clanking, most of it from the lifters-hopefully).  Anyway the
engine steadily began sounding betterand seemed to rev real strong, after
about 2 min. I shut it off and checked the oil - It was turning into the
nasty milky stuff!!

So what gives!  My main questions are:
1.  How did the cooent get in the crankcase? Why wasn't it the nasty milky
stuff?  
2.  Where is it leaking from?  Head gasket? (didn't really notice any
white sweet smelling exhaust and the plugs looked ok)  Oil/Coolent heat
exchanger?  This seems more likely seeing how the oil was trashed into the
milky gunk so quickly.  Plus it is my understanding that there are some
updates to the seals. 

My next plan was to change the oil one more time, run the engine again and
if it produced the milky gunk I would buy a pressure tester for the
cooling system.

Any comments/suggestions much needed and appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

as a commute car and track car. Anyone have any words of wisdom

Subject: Early CIS Problems


Doug, I have a 73 1/2 CIS targa so I can be of some assistance here. I
have gotten the injection system working perfectly and I would not
trade it for anything else! What you need to do is a systematic
approach to diagnosing the fuel system otherwise it's hit or miss. We
have the advantage of having the simplest and most relaible of the CIS
systems ever installed in a car, believe me you don't want to
change it. Any problems you have with the 73 1/2 basic CIS will only
be compounded in later models with more vacuum hoses and circuits.

For starters, have you checked the system pressure after the car sits
for a few hours? Perhaps if the pressure is bleeding down you need a
new check valve or a fuel pump. Get yourself a CIS gauge and go to
work!

Other things to look at:

Warmup (control pressure) when cold.
Start injector spray pattern.
Integrity of intake duct (boot) and throttle rubber seals

There are no inherent flaws in this system, it can function perfectly.

The torsion bar tube must be replaced/removed and '87 torsion bars/coil 
over springs used.

The hydralic clutch is also required (desireable?).

You're probably okay with the 915.  A transmission cooler would not be 
a bad idea.  Anderson discusses (briefly) mods to the 915 for increased
horsepower in "The 911 Performance Handbook."

If you have a 911, want to have a 911, just like 911's then you should
own this book.  [$20 from automotion.  can save you thousands of dollars]

If I remember, an external oil pump and cooler would be good for track 
use (sustained 250+ hp), and oil squirters (onto the gears) would also 
extend the gear life.

I think any 911 engine will bolt to any transmission.  Flywheel and 
clutch may need to be changed.  I think the flywheel has to match the
engine and the clutch match the transmission.

SCOTT,

my old room mate worked at a shop that did repair and modifications  on
porsches. one of the cars they built was a 3.6l in a earlier car. it will work
but the results were not what they had hoped. in there conversion a 915 tranny
was used and it held together while they had the car. the problem in the swap
is that a lot of work has to be done to get everything to fit. They used weber
carbs in there conversion and headers(no heat)
problems.
1 the 3.6 L is heavy and makes the car even more tail heavy hurting handling.
2 the 3.6l does not put out a lot of power in stock form and there are not many
perf. parts avalible.
3 the 3.6l engine is expensive to buy

a much better solution is to build a 3.5 L from a 3.2 using 100mm p/c. This
combo is a bolt in solution,perf. parts are avalible and the cost for the
engine is less. The shop my room mate worked at had also bulit a car in this
configuration and it was much faster and better handling.

2)the G50 is the stronger trans to use but a pain to put in a early car. to fit
it in you must change or modify the torsion  bar tube.
or
another way to put a G50 into a early car is to modifiy the trans. Another car
in the shop was a SC with a RUF modified turbo engine. The owner wanted a 5
speed but the RUF 5 speed is very expensive. solution. another shop  (i dont
know who but if you are really interested i could try and find out) modified
the G50 to go into earlier cars by machining the mounting face to shorten the
length of the trans and made   a new input shaft,also shorter,this combined
with a special clutch allowed the G50 to be used in earlier cars. The
modification to the G50 was not cheap but less than a RUF 5speed. You could
always use a turbo 4sp it should take as much power as you would ever get out
of a non-turbo engine.

No specs.  You should tear down, clean, and inspect the joints.  Look for
galling or notching of the race and inner and outer sections, and for
discoloration or other damage to the balls.

You should be able to tell whether the transmission case is leaking vs.
the CV's just by looking at the location of the stuff and its color.
Leaking stub axle seals at the case are common and are easy to fix.

Paul,

I don't have a direct answer to any of your questions.  I would really
recommend that you give the engine back to whomever you bought it from.
You are looking at a major mess, whatever it is, and addressing it 
yourself will not be worth the trouble.  (If we were talking about an
exotic, one-of-a-kind engine, that would be a different kettle of fish.)

The coolant system is closed, and there is no good way for coolant to
get into the crankcase.  There are lots of bad ways, and you would have
to, in all liklihood, tear down the engine to find out which has visited
itself upon you.  You would also have to tear it apart to find out just
how badly damaged the internals have become from the coolant.

The 944-series workshop manuals describe a protocol for flushing and
checking an engine after coolant has entered the case, say, from an oil-
water heat exchanger leak.  However, in those circumstances you're
dealing with a smaller amount of coolant over, generally, a short amount
of time, during which the engine has been run rather than been left
sitting.

Sorry to bear bad news...

  On the subject of cold weather start, my 85/2-944 also exhibits some 
strange behavior. On cold day when temperature is below 0 Degree F
the car start on the first try but dies after idling for 2-3 seconds.  
After this, the only way I have been able to restart the car is to crank the
engine for over two or three min. continuously without depressing the gas
pedal. This long crank will get the engine to catch and then let go type 
behavior. It misses so badly that if don't keep the starter engaged while 
the engine is in a semi-running stage that it will die again and the whole
procedure will have to repeated, i.e. 4-5 min of constant cranking. I don't
like to abuse the starter but frustration, anger and humiliation of a P-Car
letting you down overrides the prior. 

  Last Tuesday temperature in Chicago reached a low of -25F and a high of -15F. 
I drove the car to work and it was parked there for the 12 hours. In the 
evening when I tried starting, it engine showed symptom of catching, then 
let go. I paid a guy with the generator, hoping to get the boost I needed
to get the Beast going. We abandoned the process when I started to smell 
the starter getting hot.  The short end of the story is that the car refused 
to start for the next two days as the temperature ranged between -25F to -5F.
Yesterday, the temperature got above 20F (A real heat wave :-) ) and I was
able to get the car started with the long cranking technique. 

Battery is 3-month old DieHart and seems good because I was able to start the
car after it sat in the cold for 3 days.  It seems to me that it is a gas
or mixture related problem and have the following hunch.
        
        1)  Could the fuel Injectors nozzles be freezing up. I did have
            a full tank gas, treated with a bottle of Heet. I wish that
            it was a Carb. instead of an EFI because I don't know
            where to spray the Starting fluid on an EFI?  

        2)  Does the Below Zero temperature makes the DME go brain dead and
            it does not provide the right mixture. What is a good test for 
          this? 

        3)  Could it be the O2 sensor?

Any thing else I should be aware off. This is my first winter with the
944 and wanted to know some techniques to start the car in cold weather.
Like my RX-7 needs 4 pump, half choke and a kick on the gas pedal once 
the engine start catching. I have learned this after owning the the RX-7
for the last 8 years.

Affie.

My goal was to force the piston in the slave cylinder to move in and out
by expernal mechanical means, thereby pulling fluid all the way down from
the reservoir as the piston is extended, and pushing the fluid back to
the reservoir (hopefully along with any air bubbles) as the piston is
pushed back. Pushing the piston back is easy. You can use anything sort
of pointy on the end, and the actuating rod which ordinarily connects
the piston of the slave ctlinder to the lever which enters the bellhousing
is as good as anything. Note that this actuating rod needs to be out of 
the way for this operation, or the strong clutch springs won't let the
slave cylinder piston get very far out (i.e. not much total fluid moves).
The problem which I was trying to remember how I solved was making the
piston extend, since you can push on it easily, but not pull it very
easily. I believe what I did was to pump the clutch pedal a few times
(with the actuating rod removed, so the piston keeps coming out further,
rather than being pushed back in by the clutch springs). I then left the
clutch pedal in the up position so the port to the reservoir in the
master cylinder is uncovered, and pushed the slave cylinder piston back 
in, so a significant volume of fluid (a full slave cylinder worth) was
pushed back up to the reservoir, along with the bubble from the master
cylinder (assuming the car is tilted enough that the bubble is near
the port going to the reservoir).

As I mentioned, it is easier to see with a picture, keeping in mind that
a bubble will move to the top of any enclosed volume.

    Greetings Porshce fans-

    A couple of years ago I rebuilt a 1971 911 2.2 motor.  After the
    required break-in procedure, I stopped by a friend's house.  My
    friend, who has a considerable amount of experience with
    rebuilding 911s, commented that he heard a noise from what he
    thought was the lower end of my motor.  After a  few minutes of
    listening, he guessed that it was my intermediate shaft and that I
    should have replaced the gears on it prior to closing the case up.
    I told him that I not only replaced the gears, but I replaced the
    whole shaft.  My replacement part, however, was not brand new.
    Whereas the alloy gear on the old shaft was in not terrific shape,
    the replacement shaft had very clean gears (as well as the same
    number "0" or "1", I am not sure which it was).  My question is
    whether I should have replaced the gear with a brand new one or
    whether I was allright to go with the "clean" one I used.

    Any input/comments are appreciated

Subject: 3.6 engine/trans into SC

Just a note to let people know you CAN put a G50 into a 911 w/o changing the
torsion tube.  Several have been done into 930's that I know of (No, I
haven't done one, but I can put you in touch w/ someone who has done
several.) 

Basic question is why go to all the trouble because you aren't putting 600 hp
into the chassis.  I don't think anyone would have a problem fitting a stock
3.6 to a stock 915 for street use.  Just be kind to the thing!

Further, unless you picked up the 3.6 very cheap (I haven't had the chance
to, yet...at least not one that didn't have questionable origin!), I'd
recommend building the 3.0 into a 3.2 using a Carrera/Turbo crank and rods
(74.4 stroke) and Carrera P/C set.  This is my most popular upgrade right
now. A good used set of these parts is much less than the 3.2 "big bore" kit
from Mahle.

Modifying these cars doesn't have to put you in the poor house!

A nice alternative to this would be to rebuilt the 3.0 with
98 mm PCs with 9.8 CR. This brings the displacement out to
3.2 while retaining the simpler ignition and fuel systems.
RUF did a similar conversion for the 911SC along with sport

Subject: Hood Struts

    John Wright's insight that "the critical design problem of the gas
    spring is the high pressure seal" is supported by some commentary
    I once heard on why the gas hood shocks fail (the commentary might
    even have been on this forum, so if I am repeating old news, my
    apoligies).

    As I recall, and as John so well described, the rod
    that slides up and down in the pressurized cylinder is sealed in
    place by some type of O ring.  This O ring is the weak link in the
    system which becomes weaker when cold.  I think part of the
    problem with the struts is that the pressure in the cylinder is
    reduced when the tempature is reduced (I am not an engineer, but I
    think that is one of the laws of physics if I rember my high
    school physics), thus not as much force to hold the hood up.
    Another problem, and this is the bigger problem, is that the O
    ring often times twists because the strut is forced down into the
    cylinder too quickly, allowing the pressurized gas to leak out at
    that instant or later if it does not reseal.  A couple of
    solutions are: 1) only raise and lower your hood during warm
    weather; 2) or more practicaly, raise and lower your hood slowly,
    allowing the seal to do its job.  Often times the second solution
    means keeping muscle bound goons from touching your hood and
    attempting to slam the poor thing into the pavement, afterall,
    don't 911 hoods at least require a certain finesse to close
    properly (two hands, one on either side of the badge, moderate
    pressure downward after the first catch to cynch it closed).  I
    hope this helps.

Porschephiles, 

Thanks for both the tips and encouragement in ways to remove my starter.  I got
it out last night by removing the rear shroud, just as Pete suggested.  Great
procedure, Pete.  Thanks.  Of course, after wrestling with everything I only
got about 5% of the grunge on me, so probably should take Jim Young's suggestion
and remove the engine to get the remaining 95%.  I still may.

An item of interest I found is that the top bolt head had been drilled in one of
the flats and a roll pin inserted, undoubtedly to keep the bolt from turning
while removing the nut.  Since the car has been a race car since about 1962,
who know what other modifications or surprises I might uncover.  I'm only a
recent owner and am just learning the intracies of 356's.

I also found the starter to be a 6 volt unit with a 12 volt sellenoid (sp?),
but Pellow's ABC's actually recommends this when converting to 12 volts, and
suggests the alternatives are too much trouble and money.  Does anyone have any
contrary advice?  Automotion's sale is coming up in a couple of weeks; just in

Dear Ross,

I recently bought a '78 924. I made a list of things that one should note
in order to make a reasonable offer. Most of the parts of this list are
the things that were wrong with the car I bought. Good luck.

1. Rust in many places, especially in the part between the front wheels
   and the door.
2. 2 new tires needed.
4. Alignment.
5. Air filter
6. Cam belt
7. Distributor cap and rotor (~$16) and spark plag wires (>$50)
8. Radiator hoses (~$130 to replace all of them)
9. Car was overheating in traffic, hopefully new thermostat and fan
   switch (~$28)
10. Upgrade of fuel accumulator to cure starting problems (~110)
11. Sunroof seal
12. Rear brakes ($38 ferrodo brake shoes (set) & $35 each wheel cylinder)
13. Muffler (the cheapest muffler you can find will cost you around $200,
    if you go to a porsche repair shop the cost will be around $500)
14. Oil leaks
15. Engine vibrations (maybe from motor mounts) - Lubro Molly helped a
    lot.
16. Gas cap was completely rusted ($20).
17. Heating was not working properly, heater valve has to be changed
    (~$20)
18. Also check the a/c (if any) the shocks and ask when the clutch was
    replaced.

Most of the prices I mention are from automotion - I do not have the
catalog with me so most of them are good approximations. If you go to a
repair shop, the cost in most cases will be at least double, but 924 is
very simple so you can do many of the above things yourself. Anyway 924
is a fan car to drive.

Subject: 914: Help - It's running too good!

Hi all!

Well I'm about 600 miles into my maiden voyage, and I've got a bit of a
problem.  In Socorro, NM I set the idle to about 800 RPM.  Here in Phoenix it's
wants to idle at 1900 RPM.  With the idle adjustment screw all of the way in I
can get it down to about 1500.  Socorro is at 4300', Phoenix is about 1000'
elevation.  Is this the problem (thick air)? How can I fix it? I've got the
throttle valve out and it looks OK (I thought that maybe it was leaking air
around the "acceleration" switch on the bottom or something.  If the idle
adjustment screw protruded into the throttle opening more it might be OK...do I
want to try and "fix" it so that happens?

Help! The weather is way too nice to have car parts laying in the
driveway. :-)

in what I want. I am looking for either a 1990 944 S2 or
a 1989 944 Turbo S both are somewhat rare cars according to

Subject: '77 911S orig. 2.7l engine woes


I took my '77 911S which has been leaking pretty bad (few tablespoons from
different spots under the engine area at every stop) since last Oct. when
I purchased it, in to Heyer Performance in Mtn. View, CA.  Tony Heyer was
recommended to me by Bruce Anderson over the phone.

This morning Tony listened to the engine, and put the car up, and we saw
several areas where leaks needed to be fixed.  After I got to work in my
Honda, Tony called and said that after doing a compression check, where
cyl. 1 was 100, 2-5 were bet. 125 and 150, and he couldn't get the spark
plug out of cyl. 6, he started looking at the engine closer, and took it
for an extended drive where he felt it was lacking power.  

He then put it up again and feels that the engine head is loose, and is
probably has broken head studs.  He feels that just fixing the leaks would
not be right, since the whole engine needs rebuilding or replacing in his
opinion.  I asked if I could just drive it with low compression for 20K or
so miles, but have the leaks fixed, and he said this might be possible,
but not recommended.

I'm wondering if Tony has the expectations of all 911s to be in race or
top notch condition, while my budget now may require me to drive it until
it dies (or close), before rebuilding or getting a used '78 or '79 3.0 SC
engine replacement.

Tony did not recommend a top end only rebuild, since it looks like the
bottom end of the 2.7l is original with 127k miles, and would go shortly
thereafter.  He feels that engine rebuilders often only rebuild 911
engines to go about 40K before another rebuild is required, unless they
are very skilled, and avoid Automotion parts, etc.
 
I'd be welcome to any opinions on whether it is worth fixing the oil leaks
only on my 911 with possibly loose head, or if I should not bother.  Tony
said he would feel like he was ripping me off by fixing the oil leaks,
knowing the head was possibly leaking and possibly had broken head studs.

Also, Tony was very concerned that I try to get all the EGR parts which
are gone (the pump is there but not hooked up), as even though it will pass
the pipe test, it may not pass visual inspection without that stuff, which
is very expensive.

Thanks for any opinions.

Subject: Radar detectors

	I have been reading the messages about radar detectors on and off since I
first joined the list.  I have in the last 10 or years had many different radar
detectors but I keep going back to products made by ESCORT.  I just received a
VALENTINE ONE W/laser and I have been running it side by side with my PASSPORT
4500 which does receive all of the same types of radar  and seems to work just
as well on everything but X band.  The X band does seem to be a little more
sensitive on the  VALENTINE ONE but that will only make more annoying.  As for
the logic and advance logic modes they are not quick to set or do they remember
how they are set.  The bogie counter and the display might impress my friends
when they ride with me and let you know when a cop is hidden in a false, but I
have never had a ticket stick from a cop sitting in a know false zone.  I once
had a WHILSTER with a digital signal meter but that grew old after a couple
days.  The price and the wait for the   VALENTINE ONE W/laser and or  VALENTINE
ONE are just not worth it.



P.S. I will be sending this back in a couple of days for my full refund and If
anybody out there must have one they can buy this one from me for the $425 I
paid and skip the waiting list.

What a great way to start a religious war! I have a Valentine One and
feel that there is nothing better. Every test I've ever seen agrees.

The current model is X/K/superwide Ka/Laser at $399 (I think)
You can call them for reprints of all of the magazines tests and
their product literature. (800) 331-3030 You can also check Car and
Driver for their ad.

It is a truly remarkable piece of equipment. They also provide upgrades
for older Valentine Ones at a reasonable price. I have to send mine in
for the laser upgrade soon. They upgrade for the difference in price
between what you paid and the current price.

What kind of gas are you guys using?

No kidding, try swapping brands.  I know this is like a religion
thing, but I'm going to recomend Amoco premium.  

Gasoline formulas have changed a lot in the last few years
because of new EPA regulations.  The EPA has set new rules
regarding evaporation rates.  A gasoline's evaporation rate 
will effect your car's cold starting.  A lower evaporation rate 
means the fuel will not atomize as will when the engine is cold and
requiring a richer mixture causing flooding and such.

Amoco claims to have overcome the problems caused by lower evaporation 
rates.

I welcome anyone's comments on this subject.

There was a whole discussion on radar detectors a couple of months ago on this

I agree.  These days it seems like you have to take them up on the offer of
replacement more frequently, but the offer still holds.  I have had reasonably
good luck with the Craftsman.  I have had better luck since I started taking
seriously recommendations that the torque setting be backed off to about 5 lbs.
before storing for any length of time.  I was having trouble with the handle
jamming, and "releasing" it solved the problem.  Only DON'T back it off all the

Except that the torque wrenches only have a 1 year warrenty, same as
electrial tools.  Yes, the craftsman stuff, not the sears stuff.

For the most part I agree.  Unless you are using it daily you'll
be happy.  Sears has clearly targeted this market and has reduced
quality as a result.

I had a problem with my craftsman torque wrench.  The nut that holds
the handle on came loose.  Not a problem except that I also lost the
calibration.

Wound up recalibrating from another wrench.

I have a lot of craftsman tools.  I don't plan on buying any more.

The end wrenchs flex too much.  The screwdrivers are too soft.  Most
power tools are crud.  The ratchet actions are rough.  The extensions
break before *cheap* sockets and ratchets.  I could go on.

Yes, you can walk in and return most of them and walk out with a 
replacement.

No, it's not something I want to do in the middle of a car.

Now I just take a deeeep breath and buy snap-on.

By the way, the 4" long 3/8 drive ratchet snap-on sells (about $40) 
is *wonderful* in a 911 engine compartment.  Imparts has a similar
one for $25 (probably from wright).

Also, the snap-on wrenchs will grip fasteners that will turn in a 
craftsman wrench.  This alone almost makes the (large) increase in
cost worth it.

Sorry, I have to give you a "Phlapppttttt! =8^P" on that one.  I got one of
those a while ago for xmas.  The following spring, I used it to tighten down a
new oil pan (first time I used the thing).  Set on the lowest part of the spec
range, it still overtightened the bolts enough to let the oil pan crack before
"clicking" (yes, I used the correct bolt sequence and gradually snugged up the
bolts in order).
Bringing it back to Sears, you'll get pointed to the fine print, which states
torque wrenches (among other tools; I'd bet the guidelines equates to "tools
with cost over $xx") are specifically not covered.  So you get to bring it to
the repair center and have them re-calibrate it for you (I think the wstimate
was around $40).  Mind you, this was for a brand new tool I had never used,
but made the mistake of letting sit unused in my garage since acquisition.
I borrowed a Snap-on wrench from a friendly mechanic at my shop, and had no
problems with it and the replacement pan.....  YMMV

	I had a similar problem with my 914 when I redid all the gaskets

    below 3000 RPM, and the Never-Seez (good to 1800 deg F) was dripping
    off of the red-hot heat exchangers.  The problem turned out to be related
    to the moron who last worked on the engine (me) forgot to tighten the

I believe that the oil could be a culprit but during the course of long

the normal reading on my car). I am using 20W50 and was planning on changing 
it with synthetic Castor-Oil 5w50 oil. 

Beside the oil, I think that the it could be:

	1)	The DME that is enriching the mixture. 

	2)	The Oxygen sensor could be malfunctioning. Just a hunch.

	3).	Could it be that the fuel injectors nozzle were frozen shut?

I understand and appreciate the honesty here, it makes logical sense, and
agrees with my reading here, and the 911 Performance Handbook.  However,
I'd be interested in hearing from owners who don't race their cars, on how
long the engine will last, say not reving it over 3400 or so rpm, driving
30 miles a day?

Bruce Anderson seems to imply in his book that no 2.7 ever goes over
30,000 miles with thermal reactors, without a top end rebuild, and only to
60,000 if it has copper-alloy valve guides.  How can these engines go out
at such precise mileage?  How can anyone recommend these engines, are they
ever worth rebuilding?  Bruce later in his performance chapter recommends
going to a 2.7.  Is it responsible to say that if a 2.7 has over 1xx,xxx
miles that it needs a bottom end job too?

911?  I have a '76 and would like to try this.  I 
know the popular recommendation is 15X7s with
205/60s, but it seems the 16s would have alot of
advantages, both in handling(lower sidewall height)
and aesthetics?  Any ideas?

Are you a PCA member?  Porsche Panorama is an excellent place to start.  If hou
have not yet joined PCA -- which is entirely possible, as you sound like you
are buying your first Porsche -- I would recommend seeking out a colleague or

The nice thing about race engines is that they get taken apart *VERY*
frequently. It's an operating feature since there's nothing worse than
losing a race your could have won if you'd just done your maintenence.
And in the pro racing series, there's serious money on the line too.

For the street, you just don't rebuild engines until you need to. And as
a result, you get all kinds of answers. And, as usual, you milage may
vary.... My Euro 911SC has like 229,000 KM on the clock. I autox it,
I time trial it, I take it to drivers ed, and I put about 18,000 miles
a year on it (yes, I'm mixing units -- sue me). Still with the original
long block, too. And it's showing no signs of fading.

On the other hand, I have friends who have had to rebuild at 50,000
miles on late Carreras...

It's only responsible to say that something *REALLY* needs a bottom end
job when you're standing there with the bearings in your hand. But in
all probability, *ALL* cars with over 10k miles would show enough
bearing wear to "need" a bottom end job. The problem is, how to you know
that you're OK to operate vs. about to explode... The real answer is to
listen to the "experts" who are mainly experts because they have more
experience than the rest of us. And from the experience, they can draw
generalizations like "2.7s get top end at 30K miles, bottom end at 100k".

Well, maybe nothing. On the other hand, when I asked Elmer (my crew chief,

Subject: Torque Wrenches

    Mike Kehr's comments concerning quaility of torgue wrenches raises
    an important issue.

    Yesterday I mentioned rebuilding my 911 2.2 motor.  As part of
    that rebuild I did some work on my transmission.  When I was
    closing up the differential I was using a no-name 1/2" torque
    wrench (very similar to Sears' digital wrench) to reinstall the
    stretch bolts for the stubby axels (I think that is what they are
    called).  After about five minutes of torquing down the bolts,
    with no "click," my friend and I started to wonder just how much
    these bolts stretch.  Instead of torquing any more, we tested the
    wrench out by backing of the ft/lbs and trying to get it to click
    at a lower setting- no go.  I can only imagine the heart ache of
    having to bring my transmission to a machine shop to have them
    remove the snaped-off stretch bolt from the inside of the
    differential because of a piece of junk torque wrench.

    Glenn Ingram is a strong advocate of not being cheap or cutting
    corners when it comes to the safety of you or your car (i.e.,
    wheels, roll cage, seats, belts, helmet, etc. must be of the best
    quality- saving a few dollars just isn't the issue with your
    life).  I think Glenn's rationale in some way applies to
    tools, at least tools such as torque wrenches that make sure your
    car is within specification/tolerance.  Remeber also that tools
    are free (a strange concept, but every time you buy a tool,
    presumably you are doing so to avoid having to pay someone else to
    use their own tool at ten times the price).  Invest in the best
    tool now, Snap-On, Mac, Hazet, etc. will all be with you long
    after you have thrown out the garbage torque wrench when you
    realize it is not even good enough to use as a breaker bar (I am
    using my no-name wrench occasionaly to break wheel lugs free).  As
    for the cost, look around for used Snap-On, etc. in the want ads,
    swap meets, etc. and have them recallibrated/tested.  We have and
    enjoy quality cars, I also suggest you can have and enjoy a
    quality tool with the same respect we have for the engineering and
    manufacturing Porsche dedicates to its products.

    Just my 2 cents worth.

    Hmmm. . .  If this were a 1.7 or 2.0, I'd say definitely a vaccuum
leak.  However, yours is a 1.8L, and they tend to run lean when they
have leaks.
    It sounds like metered air is getting from one side of the throttle
valve to the other somehow.  I'd check the Auxiliary Air Valve.  It's
just to the front (of the car) side of the intake air distributor.  If
it's leaking internally or not there, tons of air would be bypassing 
the throttle, giving you a *high* idle.
    Of course, that wouldn't explain why it ran fine at altitude.  Per-
haps you have the optional barometer on there, and it's broken?  Dunno.
    Good luck!

re: torque wrenches.

I have used craftsman torque wrenches for a while with no problem,
BUT, realize that there are craftsman wrenches, etc available
throuht the tool catalog not commonly sold in the stores.  The
craftsman wrench I used is called "digitork" and according to their
catalog as a greater accuracy than the "microtork?" sold in the
stores, it also cost about $80 or so and has a different adjustment
mechanism.

some of the tools in the catalog are designated craftsman
"professional" or something like that, cost a little more and are
IMHO a better quality tool than the ones carried in the stores. But
they are still way cheaper than the jobbers (mac, snap-on, etc) and
very easy to return if broken.

My 2.7 has 153K miles with the reactors on it and still runs fine (it puffs

deserves to leak a little.  It was very late in the production run and came
with the divlar studs from the factory.  

I am currently replacing it with a 3.2 (it is under the knife as I write
this) but my mechanic is helping sell the 2.7 to another of his customers
who needs a running engine.  

I am the third owner and as far as I can tell it has alwys been a daily

    As I have discussed in some recent threads, I am planning on

Well, my computer almost melted down from all the email yesterday
afternoon....

1.  upgrading from 3.0

Anyone can do just about anything once you have an aluminum case (and no I
don't mean a pre-69 aluminum one, ANYTHING vague in a posting and you guys
just HAVE to pounce on it to show everyone how sharp you are.)  Again, a used
3.2/3.3 (74.4 mm) crank and rods coupled w/ stock 3.2 Carrera pistons
assembled w/ stock large port CIS makes a fantastic engine for a whole lot
less than buying a new Mahle 98mm or 100mm P/C set.  Plus you don't have to
use twin ignition.  Best second alternative is a set of Euro 3.0 pistons.

2. G50 in pre '86

Another posting basically said what you have to do. You shorten the
bellhousing and input shaft 1 1/2 inches and use a 930 3.0 clutch disc. A
little bit of torsion tube clearancing is still required.  No one ever said
it was cheap, but if you want an extra gear in a 930 w/ a wild Motronic
upgrade engine, it's worth it.

3.  parts sources

A few people have talked about where to buy parts, named aftermarket
suppliers, etc.  Realize there really aren't many (if any) generic
replacements for Porsches.  Someone named Automotion specifically.  Sorry,
buddy, everyone buys from the several direct importers around the country. 
The importers go to Bosch, Sachs, etc. and purchase directly.  Then the
shops, catalog houses, and even dealers, buy from them.  A few people direct
import, but that's the minority. So believe what you want...I have accounts
with most all of them.

4. parts for sale

Meltdown on the requests...I just have 911 engine and transaxle parts. So if
you didn't get an email back, I didn't ignore you. Just don't have what
you're looking for.  Sorry.

A new/used 3.0 SC for 2-3K??? I think any engine
you could get for that would be in the same shape
as the 2.71

There are a couple of places (Stoddard is one) that
offer rebuilt "short blocks" with no core required
for about $3,500. The only thing they ever have in
stock though, are lower displacement T's.

Rather than try to drive the car at <3,500rpm which is
not going to be kind on either the engine or the driver,
it would be better to sell the car to someone who can 
fix it themselves. An alternative would be to buy a 
"beater" and turn the 911 into a long-term project 
(medium-term education + medium-term rebuild + sweat 
equity + approx. $5,000)

There just isn't any free lunch. If you try to save money
now, the engine is likely to totally self destruct,
requiring a new (or new used) engine. I haven't seen 
anything for less than it would cost to do a correct 
rebuild, so as the man said "pay me now or pay me later".

That's why it's so critical to check these cars out 
thoroughly before you buy. Dean Bachelder in his book on 
buying a used Porsche says something to the effect that
buying a Porsche with problems can be the worst financial
nightmare of your life. 

I was also glad to see a really honest mechanic!

I had this same problem on my '81 911 SC.  The seatbelt light would
go on at random times.  My mechanic said it was a voltage problem.
The light goes on when the voltage goes out of range.  Everything
else ran fine so I left it.  Finally the voltage problem got so bad
that I could still start the engine and it would idle but pushing
on the gas peddle just made the engine bog down.  I hooked up a
voltmeter and the voltage was going anywhere from 5 volts to 17 volts.
The problem was intermittent.  It values would be fine then out of range
and then fine again.  The problem was tracked down to the voltage
regulator, which is mounted on the wall to the left of the engine
(in my car).  My shop put in a Mercedes :-) voltage regulator ($100) and
everything works great again.

This is definitely an improper generalization here Stan.  I may get flamed

Have you ever looked at an Infinit q45?  I know they're no fun to drive,

I too have a lot of Craftsman tools, but will not buy any more.  The stuff I
bought 20 years ago, like the Walker floor jack is great.  The stuff I more
recently purchased, like their shop vacuum is a p.o.s.

Griot's Garage catalog has some nice looking tools.  I've bought some other
things from them and they seem to be of high quality, if a little pricey.  
Anyone bought tools from them?

Robert,
A friend and I just finished restoring some SC rims.  This is from our
experience.  The best way to polish the rims is to have a commercial company
do it for you (shouldn't cost more than $20/wheel).  Polishing them by hand
is tedious and time-consuming.  Besides, you can't do as good a job as a
commercial polisher using the proper equipment can.

To restore the inner part of the wheel, you should first sand off all the old
finish using 320 wet or dry.  Mask the polished surface and apply two coats
of Dupont Vari-Prime.  Allow this to dry for 24 hours.  Then apply three
coats of satin black catalyzed acrylic enamel.

To restore the back of the wheel:  sand smooth, prime with urethane two-part
primer, and allow to dry for 24 hours.  Then apply three coats of gloss black
catalyzed acrylic enamel.  Good luck!

Subject: 911 3.0l upgrade

    Two recent threads lead me to a couple of questions:

    Ken mentioned "buildig the 3.0 into a 3.2 using a Carrera/Turbo
    crank and rods (74.4 stroke) and Carrera P/C set."  What about
    using the 3.0l P/C set and changing over to a 3.2/3.3 crank and
    rods?  I think this might be a one step improvement
    over a straight upgrade to the complete 3.2 set up
    because of the higher resulting compression ratio (9.8:1 or
    higher, depending on the original CR of the 3.0l PCs).  I heard
    that this was the hot setup, higher compression than a straight
    3.2, and more HP, am I wrong?

    Also, Sugi mentions 98 mm PCs with 9.8 CR (sounds close to what I
    mention above).  Are these aftermarket PCs?  Which ones?  On what
    crank/rods?  But, shouldn't the HP of a 3.2 displacement, with a
    CR of nearly 10:1, with sport camshafts and exhaust, be more than
    225 HP?  Sounds a little low to me.

    Also, a couple of months or so ago I checked into some aftermarket
    pistons for my rebuild.  Does anyone know about any aftermarket
    pistions (high CR) that don't have the problems Bruce Anderson
    talks about (sloppy tolerance because the pistons are not made to
    expand at the same rate, etc.).  I would think that a set of
    aftermarket pistons (advertised around $1,000) would be a less
    expensive alternative to upgrading a 3.0 set up by finding a 3.2
    PC set, crank, rods, etc.

    Fire away.

BFG has now begun manufacturing 205/50-17 and 255/40-17 tires as fittment
for the Porsche 964 series cars (C2/4 w/sport suspension and RS America).
At current, they are producing primarily the 230 (road race) compound, but
plan on also manufacturing the autocross compound as well.  I ordered a 

set and was told to expect delivery by mid-February at the latest. Finally!!!

Until now, the only options available have been to either buy a set
of 16" wheels (like I did) or buy what was left of the Toyo F1-S
sets left over from the aborted U.S. Carrera Cup series (did this too).

Since BFG is in the process of moving their ordering department for
Team T/A, you can either order the tires through your local BFG Team T/A
outlet, or by phone at 1-800-RACE-BFG.  


Disclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with BFG other than the fact that
they listened to my constant requests to build these things (along with
many other RS America drivers) and acted.  


BTW: Yokohama basically told me to piss off, so I guess I won't be 

buying THEIR tires....

Guess I don't need these now...
Anybody in the market for some C2/4 factory wheels in 6" and 8"
fitted with Yokohama A008 RSII's in 225/50-16 and 245/45-16?

Maybe we'd best qualify "need" here. I've *NEVER* seen a bearing come
out of the bottom end of *ANYTHING* with *ANY* miles on it that could
be reused. In over fifteen years of building engines, on everything
from Cummins diesel generators through Ferraris, including most of 
the PacRim cars.

And at 10k miles, the intersection of probablility and physics have
almost certainly kicked your don't need a rebuild ass to the point that
*IF YOU LOOKED*, you'd rebuild it. Trick is, **DOES THE CAR MAKE YOU LOOK**??
(BTW, that's the thrust of my original comments,if you re-read them)

For *most* of the Japanese cars, and *most* of the German cars, and in fact,
for JUST ABOUT ANYTHING BUILT SINCE 1950 that isn't a race car, the answer
is "no". 

And there lies the rub: if a bearing wears beyond the limit and you don't 
see it, does it count? If you're a perfectionist, then the answer is
"yes" and "the car needs a rebuild". If you're a drive-it-'til-it-drops
type, then the answer is "no" and "the car does not need a bottom end job".

In real life, where I drive cars to and from work, the store, or real
fast on the freeway because it's there, who cares if the bearing shows
wear -- until you start knocking or losing oil pressure. On the race track,
though, that sucker comes apart every fifth race. Even though that's only 
probably 500 miles. And if I were doing *REAL* endurance racing, or
pro racing, it would be a hell of a lot more frequent than that...

So, I still stand by my *original* comment: in  all probability, *ALL* cars
with over 10k miles would show enough bearing wear to "need" a bottom end 
job. That's just the way things work. And if you don't believe me, bring 
your car by Ghost Racing World Headquarters -- we'll pop your crank out
and have a look. If you're right, the rebuild's on me; if I'm right,
well, get out your check book, 'cause we *don't* take Porschephiles

Stan,
  I still think there's an acceptable point of wear, at which point a
rebuild is not necessary for a non race driver, but is for a race driver
or perfectionist.

If you take apart bicycle wheel axles, and the bearings come out crushed,
you need to replace the bearings, and probably the axle if it's pitted. 
If the wheel spins fine, no grinding noises, no resistance, why not leave
the wheel alone, even though knowing that having 30, or 60 miles on your
bicycle, probably mean that the bearings are not perfectly as round as
when the bike had 0 miles on it?

Hi All
After changing the clutch in my 73 2.0l 914 (10 hours of christmass
vacation fun) and getting it all back together the car doesn't run right.
The car has a crazy idle occasionally were the motor will almost stall then
spin up to 2000RPM's and almost stall. It does this until the gas pedal is
floored or the car stalls and on restart is fine. Another symtom of FI woes
is the car misses and backfires when cold when and only when the gas pedal
is less then half way to the floor and rpm's between 2500-4000. Last
symptom is at high way speeds with the car warmed up as much as it gets in
5 degree weather it miss ounce about every 15 minutes. Just feels like one
of the cylinders didn't fire then everything back to normal. 
This is what I have tried to fix the car.Check fuel pump pressure and found
it to be good. Cleaned plugs, no change. Replaced plugs no change. New plug
wires had no effect. Distributer and coil are new from the summer.  Replace
all FI related vac. tubes. This was a pain in the tail! After taking all
these steps I went to the local p-car specialist. He had the car for a week
and a half and could not figure it out even after he found someone with
working diagnostic equipment for the cars FI. Any suggestions at what it
could be? The mechanic suggested I replace the cheapest parts of FI and
work my way up to most expesive hoping a cheap part would fix it. All this
is making me think about downgrading to webers.

Subject: Re: '77 911S orig. 2.7l engine woes

Ted,

Go back and read my last two notes: that's exactly my point! Summed up:

1) it's already worn out to the point that you'd need to replace it if
   you opened it up

2) how do you know when it's time to open it up? when it is obviously
   broken, *OR* when the accumulated experience of many years of many
   practicioners says "it's time".

Now, given that you *KNOW* that (1) is right, you're just gambling
if you don't pop it open when (2) hits. Even if it's not broken into
little pieces when you open it, you *KNOW* that since you're in there, 
you need to replace certain parts, and that having done so, the experience
referenced in (2) says it will be a reasonably long time before you have to
worry about it at all again.

Further, my experience has been (and I thing I'm pretty safe in saying 
that this is consistent with just about everyone else's experience)
that on Porsche engines, or any other exotic piece of gear from
cars to cameras, if you fix a problem sooner rather than later, it
will be cheaper to have done so that to have waited. That tired engine
that right now needs valve guides and main bearings will likely need
major head work and a new crank if you wait. Or if you're the lucky
type, you'll snap off a valve and drop it through a piston and maybe
push a rod out the side of the case.

Entropy *ALWAYS* wins, eventually.  Or, as the Fram guy used to say
"you can pay me now or you can pay me later".

I have just replaced the struts on my 86' 951, along with the upper strut

adjustable,and Porsche hardware.This service was performed because I had and
still have a shimmy in my steering wheel(severe at times).I took my time with

little play in the upper strut area when I push in at the top of the wheel and
pull out at the bottom and vice versa. My friends 951 has no play in the upper
strut area. What is correct? I have been told not to over torque that M-14 nut,
and that a small amount of play is normal. The weight of the car compresses the
rubber bushing and it's surrounding parts, and in turn tightens everything
up.The shimmy comes and goes and is not dependent on a certain speed, but does
increase in severety as the speed reaches the 50+ mark.The shimmy sometimes will
sometimes disappear completely for several miles, but then come back when I
change lanes or up.Tom Heiser At PCNA suggested that I apply the brakes very
lightly while not changing speed. No change, still a shimmy.I guess this test
checks to see if the brake components are the culprit.The shake only appears to
be in the steering wheel, not the body or seats.The front tires have both been
electronically speed balanced twice(on different machines).Two different sets of
wheels, same tires though. My car has 87K miles on it. The work I performed was
a result of Porschephile suggestions along with a couple mechanics deductions. I
inspected the upper strut bearings after removal and they appeared to have play
in the bearing area.I thought that replacing these parts would solve my problem?
$400.00 later and I have the same problem! What next? I did not have the wheel
alignment performed yet, but was able to get real close by marking the lower
strut area. The shimmy is exactly the same.The wheel alignment will be performed
when I have my Fuch's installed.(about a week) Should I stop driving myself nuts
till then?

Dear Mike 
 
If your rear suspension system is anything like my '69 912 (and I don't think 
there were any major changes) it is essential to remove the bushing when 
replacing the torsion bar.  When I put turbo bars in my auto-Xer, I found that 
Porsche had vulcanized the bushing right into the housing on the spring plate. 
Removing them required a lot of knife work and an overnight soaking in 
degreasing solvent to remove them.  So while replacing the bars, I put in 
adjustable spring plates and competition bushings.  Both were purchased from 
automotion [(800) 777-8881] They also have stock bushings for your model.  If 
you go with the competition bushings, I suggest you add a grease nipple to the 
bushing housing because they have been known to develop a squeak.  Either way, 
replace the bushing.  After holding the car up for the past 15 years, I almost 
guarantee that they are worn. 
 
After replacing the rear suspension, make sure the rake, level and alignment 
are ok.  This is a BIG job and may best be done by your local performance
Porsche shop.

                   V
         The rest of the engine

The cold start valve is only in the drawing for completeness.

I don't know what a deceleration valve does exactly, but my theory is that it
keeps the engine from slowing down too fast when you take your foot off of the
gas pedal so the engine has a chance to burn all of the fuel in the engine so
it doesn't go out the exhaust pipe (pollution control stuff).  It does this by
basically acting like a second throttle valve in parallel with the throttle
valve controlled by your foot. 

When you are running down the road the pressure at points A and B are a bit
less than atmospheric.  The pressure at point C will be whatever the vacuum
reading is at the intake valves. 

When you take your foot off the gas the throttle shuts, the pressure at point C
goes down (vacuum goes up).  The airflow sensor flap has a spring that trys to
shut it.  When the throttle shuts that spring will try to shut the airflow
sensor flap (since the engine has stopped sucking so much air) and the pressure
at point B will drop (because of the space in the throttle flap that allows the
engine to still get air while idling).  The pressure at point A will go up to
about atmospheric.  In the case of my engine, if the pressure at point B does
not drop enough the deceleration valve continues to feed air to the engine
(bypassing the closed throttle valve).  Since the source of this air is
downstream of the airflow sensor the EFI system just thinks that the regular
throttle valve is open and the engine should be running at 1900 RPM and it is
more than happy to keep up the fuel supply. 

All I had to do when the engine was idling at 1900 RPM was to put my hand over
the air intake to the filter box.  The pressure at point B dropped, the
deceleration valve closed, and the idle went back down to 800 RPM.  To avoid
requiring 914 owners to pull up to stoplights with their arms dangling into the
engine compartment the pressure at point B is normally driven down by having
the airflow sensor flap close enough. 

This is the part where I have to admit to shooting myself in the foot. 
Remember when I adjusted the spring tension on the airflow sensor flap to
eliminate the non-turbo lag? Well I over did it a little.  There wasn't enough
pressure in the spring to close the flap enough to get the pressure at point B
low enough to close the deceleration valve to get the idle back down to the
amount allowed by the regular throttle valve.  Get it? So I just up'ed the
spring tension on the airflow sensor flap a bit and I'm on the road again.

Pulling the cover off the airflow sensor has been enormously educational.  You
really begin to understand how the whole EFI system works...unfortunately you
only get to learn a little piece at a time.  :-)

As far as my heater problem I've noticed that the heater puts out a lot more
heat when driving with the roof off (sorry to keep doing this to you guys
where it's really winter, but I can't help myself. ;-)

That's all/enough for now.

Michael, I haven't followed your story too closely, but have you 
checked the following:

 - Ball joints (on A-arm)
 - Wheel roundness / trueness
 -Tire roundness / possible defect
 - Front toe (should be toe-in about 1/16 inch total)
 - Shock tower damage (!)
 - Odd power steering rack problem

Try a friend's front wheels & tires (or whatever) on your car; this 
might tell you if the they are to blame.

The ball joint (which is permanently mounted within the expensive 
A-arm) may be getting loose.  This would cause all sorts of grief: 
variable / random alignment, possible resonance at some speeds, but no 
effect from pressing brake pedal beyond trying to toe-out (unstable attitude).

Good luck,

Finally after prodding with the harnesses and wiring all over the

PCA has a valuation committee that will provide you with representative
values of similarly configured cars around the country. This is
mainly so that you can prove what your car is worth if you ever have
trouble with your insurance company, but can be handy for buying a
car that you don't know the value of beforehand. They don't cover
"rare" models, Speedsters, or race cars though, so don't call about that
962C you found on a lot in Hoboken... (BTW, that should be about $220K
with spares but no trailer.. 8{P ) Contact info can be found in Pano,
on the back page.

On the soft-window Targa, that's always been one of my favorites. Yes,
it leaks like a sieve, but they're great fun in the dry. I'd guess
that "average condition" should be around $5-6K, and that "needing lots
of metal replaced" (watch the battery boxes, floor pan, around all the 
lights, and inside the bumpers!) would be more like $3.5K or so. Needing
rust repair and engine work is one of those deals where someone should

Have you considered swapping the spring plates left for right?

Usually the rubber bushing is fairly good on the bottom.

Subject: Block Heaters

You could probably drop a dipstick heater into the oil tank over night.  No
help in the first few seconds of cranking, but faster warm-up after that.  One
old VW I once had came with a coil like you'd boil a cup of tea with, except
about 3-inch diameter loop of quarter-inch diameter stock.  I never had the
nerve to plug it in for more than a few minutes, 'cause it made any oil on the
bottom of the crankcase smoke.  Setting fire to Bug and garage maybe not the
best way to keep car warm enough to start.  It bolted up with the oil screen
cover on the bottom of the bug engine.

Where is a 911's oil in the morning?  Is it still in the tank, or is it able
to find its level through the oil pump, thus roughly half and half oil tank
and crankcase?  If the latter, cold cranking would probably be easier if you
could shut a valve when you put it away on a cold night, trapping the oil in
the tank.

I don't envy those for whom this is an issue.  Now that the Ice Age has come to
NJ I know that our 77 911S still starts willingly at 3 oF.  I don't want to
know about its behavior -- or mine -- in colder temps.

This may be obvious, but also check your tire pressures -- I was
recently experiencing some shimmy in my 951, and was beginning to talk
myself into getting the front wheels balanced, when I checked the tire
pressures -- they were about 8 psi low all around -- pumping 'em back up
to 36psi cured the shimmy.

I'm a new owner of a '86 951 and have a few questions:

1.  Like most 951 owners, my car also suffers from moisture
    build-up in the front turn lights.  Living in a rain belt
    (Vancouver, B.C.) makes it worst.  Do the gaskets on the
    later 951's help reduce the problem, and what other
    modifications or sealants have owners used.  I've also
    converted the driving lights (additional high beams) to work
    as per the european 951s.  These lights use H3 bulbs which
    work great, but have no seals or gaskets and also suffer from
    moisture build-up.  Has anyone found a suitable gasket/seal
    for H3 lights?   

2.  I've managed to pick-up a used set of 951 (turbo S) speakers
    (Separate Woofer, Midrange, and Tweeter) for my '86.  The
    tweeter fits just above the window buttons and the
    Woofer/Midrange/Crossover unit fits under the door armrest in
    the old door pocket.  The problem I have is figuring out how
    the Woofer/Midrange/Crossover unit is mounted onto the '86-
    style door panel.  The unit appears to have 4 mounting holes,
    but what I'm unsure about whether there should be mounting
    plate behind the door panel or just four screw retainers.  If
    anyone has taken a door panel off with the upgraded speaker
    system, I'd appreciate any information.  I do have the lower
    door pocket section that has the speaker grill.

treated FAIRLY.  Bruce's book is not the Holy Bible.  When was the data for
the thing compiled, 1985 at the latest?  When I think what I've learned in
the past YEAR, let alone 9 years...

I've done quite nicely over the years assembling low cost "reconditioned" 2.7
engines.  For every 3 cores I buy I usually get parts to make 1 really nice
engine, 1 so-so, and 1 gets tossed. The "tossed" parts are usually from the
improper machining that was done the first time the engine was rebuilt.  For
a guy with a $5-6000 car this has been a good option.  Most of these
customers don't drive the cars more than 4-5K miles a year, anyway.  So
believe what you want; I know I have many satisfied customers.

2. 3.0/3.2 piston interchangability

The 74.4mm rod uses a 23mm wrist pin. I've never tried try to rebush them for
22mm.  I can buy very low mileage 3.2 piston sets all day long for $200-400.

3.  Aftermarket pistons

Best thing to do is to find someone who's used them.  Ditto comment above w/
Anderson, data is from the early '80s, at the latest.  The pistons available
in the '70's when everyone thought that was going to be the slick way to get
around things found out the hard way.  One of my machinists does resleeve
cylinders in cast iron and uses an aftermarket piston.  Ends up costing about
$2000 for a set, you provide the donor barrels.

Yes.  Avoid the cheap junk, go for the Porsche OEM ones.  They cost more

To anyone who can help, 
 
I just got a set of velocity stacks for my '69 912 Auto-Xer from Black Forest 
Eng.  These things are 6" high and 9" wide at the bell.  What I'm looking for 
is some kind of filter to fit over these things that will prevent crap from 
getting sucked into the manifolds.  However, I don't want anything that will 
hinder air-flow too greatly (thus defeating the purpose of this exercise).  
Does anyone know of a product that could possibly fit my needs?

A friend of mine drives a 70 911 all winter long in Edmonton, Alberta.
Temperatures will often get down to -40 (F = C). We installed a block
heater for the oil that runs down into the block, and a dipstick for
the oil tank. Makes a world of difference. In addition, I had one on
my 914, which also was driven all winter there. Both cars always
started well, and are *great* winter cars (as long as you keep the

Well its funny how our Porsche hunting has had many turns. We
first started out looking at a 911 C4 but that was slightly
out of our range and I was also informed by several Porsche
driver instructors that a 911 C4 was not that great of a
car for track events. We then had a lead on a 1989 951 in
the Cincinnati, OH area, but that car was sold the day we were 
going to make a bid on it. We are now very close to cementing
a deal on a 1992 968, I was really suprised by this car. The
wife really likes this car and we were suprised at the good power
delivery of the car. The dealership was asking 35k for the car
and we are now at 31250.00. The car has 8k mi. on it and still
has 8mo. to go on the warranty. I would like to get them down
to 30k even but I don't think they will budge anymore, although
they are hot to trot to sell this before the end of the month.
This car is in perfect condition, guards red and fully loaded.
I haven't had alot of time to do reasearch on the pricing of this
car so I was going to see if club members have any opinions on this
car or its price. Decisions, decisions!!

The problem is when things heat up. Eventually, the force of combustion
will be higher than the forces holding the head sealed against the 
cylinder, at which point you'll develop a nasty exhaust leak (OK, it's
really a combustion leak, but it sounds like an exhaust leak). At
that point, it's best to stop driving it. Until then, just take it
easy and be careful...

Since you've decided to toss this engine and put in a 3.0, it really
doesn't matter how badly you hose up the heads doing this, does it?

Answer still holds:

1) I don't understand what you're saying about those stacks -- if the

   centers to have them not hit each other *OR* some bizzare setup where
   they angled off from each other...

   And from everything I know about stack sizing, that sounds just all wrong.
   
2) GT Products (who mainly makes fiberglass stuff) has the ITG foam filters

I've never put this upgrade on any cars, but I *DO* have a lot of experience
designing and modifying EFI systems for racing applications. My 
understanding is that this is a simpel swap of the hot-wire sensor for
the stock flapper box, and a new chip that understands the new outputs.
Should not hurt your engine any more than just adding a chip would,
unless you drop screws down the intake or something...

As to the value, the last time I developed a 911 EFI setup, the total
nonrecurring engineering costs were over $90k, for *two* units, and
these suckers didn't have to deal with gas variabilities, idling
correctly in different weather, or any of that street stuff. I figure
the Autothority kit has a cost-to-manufacture around $400. The rest
is chose one (depending on how well you did in business 101) :
a) them being profiteering scumbags or (b) a reasonable return on 
probably a $100K investment in getting it developed and probably 
another $7k a month in advertising expenses...

>Is there a realatively easy way to get more out of the 3.2 w/o major

Define major here... Just swapping chips adds a reasonable amount.
For more than that, you're playing the "I can do it better than the
factory" game, which *ALWAYS* costs in the mid-four to high-five

   The 3.2L crank has 4mm more stroke and .8 mm shorter rods, and the same
cylinder height as the 3.0L. The 3.2L piston has the wrist pin in a different

   Also, Sugi mentions 98 mm PCs with 9.8 CR
   Are these aftermarket PCs?  Which ones?  On what crank/rods?

The 98mm and 100mm p/c are aftermarket made by mahle. These are made for the
3.0L and 3.2L as well as 3.3turbo. On the 3.0L crank(70.4mm) you get a 3.2
(actualy more cc's than factory 3.2L) with the 98mm and 3.3L with 100mm. With
the 3.2/3.3 crank(74.4mm) you get a 3.4 and 3.5 respectively.

I think that there are some interesting things that can be done with
aftermarket pistons. There are several avalible as well as companies that can
make what ever you want. You might try talking to weisco they make all sorts of
racing pistons. One of the reasons i mention them is that they make a lot of
motercycle racing pistons and some of the new bikes use nikasil cylinders. A
posibility i was looking at was using 97mm turbo cylinders and cosworth pistons
designed for them. They were going to make some 8.5 to 1 pistons for turbos. If
you machined the heads you should be able to get 9 to 9.5 to 1 compresion and
have a little larger engine for a lot less than the 98mm or 100mm p/c.

problem). I reset everything before I left Apache Junction. The problem came
back, but went away as soon as I gained altitude...er, elevation. I wonder
if that deceleration switch is bad? Oh well.

What a trip! Socorro->Albuquerque->Flagstaff->Phoenix->Socorro. Long stretches
of gently rolling hills. Some flat high desert driving. Freezing cold (it gets
down right nippy in Flagstaff). Pouring rain. Top off weather. Slush and icy
mountain roads. What a trip. I think I set some sort of speed record for
traversing through the Salt River Canyon on US60 between Globe and Show Low,
AZ. It's fun in a Honda; it's real fun in a 914!

I filled up twice. 899mi / 26.29g = 34.2 mi/gal!! That's much higher than I
thought it would be. I averaged about 60mph -- the idea wasn't to get there
fast, just to get there. And the 32.4mi/gal includes a lot of futzin' around
in the garage and about 50 miles of stop and go city driving. I'm impressed.

Subject: 944 Suspension Upgrades


The shocks on my 1988 944  are starting to get soft and could use 
replacement before this year's track season. I would like to get this done 
prior to the advent of warm weather.  I have always thought the car was a 
little too soft (it's not a turbo or S) and would like to improve that 
aspect at the same time. Therefore, I am appealing for help from the 
collective net wisdom in answering the following questions:

1. Which brands of shocks have folks had good success with?
My personal favorites for Audis and VWs has been Bilstein, but they will 
raise the suspension a little because they are gas pressurized.

2. Do strut bearings on 944s wear out as they do on Audis and VWs? If so, it 
makes sense to replace them when the struts are taken out.

3. Is it fairly easy to lower the car with new springs? Does it make sense? 
If so, how does one lower the rear of the car?

4. What experience have people had with thicker sway bars to reduce 
cornering sway?  What brands are recommended?

5. Anyone have experience with the strut braces which tie the strut towers 
together? Any brand recommendations?

I plan to install anything I get myself (I have done similar work on other 
vehicles) so I would shy away from anything requiring specialized equipment 
other than alignment.

Thanks ahead of time for the help

From: race911@aol.com
Subject: 911 engine/trans.

I wanted to post something thorough, so I can consolidate the 4-5 individual
conversations I've been having re:  what's the best way to modify my 3.0/3.2
car.  I hope the rest of the group finds it informative, also.

1.  Modifications and increased driving enjoyment

I've found that even though we all "speak" horsepower, it's actually the
improved torque characteristics that increase our driving enjoyment.  On the
street, or in light competition, we get the thrill from the low speed
accelerative force.  (I'm not a physicist, so I'm not going to get
technical.)

One way to accomplish this is to increase the compression ratio.  That's what
the factory has done in the last 15 years; and with increased compression
comes better throttle response and "grunt" out of that corner so you can
rocket down the straight.  The 80-on 3.0 engine was 9.3:1 here, and 9.8:1 in
Europe; the 3.2 engine was 9.5:1 here and 10.3:1 in Europe. (Measured
compression is slightly less.) The 3.6 engine is over 11:1!  The 3.2/3.6
Motronic engines allow this super high compression because the knock sensor
can tell the DME to retard the timing if the gasoline octane is insufficient.
 A drive in a Euro-3.2 with real race gas was a real eye opener!

Another way to increase torque is to increase displacement.  Drive a 2.4S,
then a 2.7RS.  Same everything, except for about 350cc displacement.  A whole
different driving experience.

A combination of the above is what I explained a few days ago with the 3.2
upgrade to a '78-79 3.0SC engine.  It works great, and it's affordable given
most of these cars are worth $8-11K.  I know this engine will outaccelerate a
stock C2 3.6, and if you get the jump, can keep a stock 930 behind you up to
150 mph.  Best of all, however, is the more linear torque band than a
Motronic 3.2 with its super large intake tract.

2.  Modifications and track competition

An engine combination that may be wonderful to drive may, however, run at
odds with the rules of a giving racing body.  So it may be best to
compromise; a little less of something may mean you don't run against that
car that has been trailered, or runs on slicks, etc.  Basically, you don't
want to outclass yourself.  And you'd be surprised how quick very
close-to-stock cars run.

The best example that comes to mind is a certain 3.0SC.  A guy named Jim Vial
used to run it.  (He now runs the BRD RS America) It has been in VW & PORSCHE
magazine.  In POC, they let you play around in production class with an SC so
all can run the 80-83 US piston (9.3:1 compression) and '78-9 large runner
intake.  On the face of it, this engine isn't going to blow your mind.  But
on the track, with the legal suspension mods, a car like this will put most
anything but a really good race car to shame.

I know that car could run 1:36 at Willow Springs; they now run 1:32 with the
RS America (that's just a tick behind the GT-2 914-6's of Chuck McKinney and
John Williamson).  By comparison, they ran 1:12 or a little under at Phoenix
last February.  Hans Stuck in the Supercar 930 ran 1:08.5 in October.  I ran
1:14.8 with my near stock car, and we had a 70 degree track in late October. 
Monte Smith ran 1:12.6 in his RS America, and David Raines (914-6 w/ real RS
engine) ran 1:13.5 that weekend.

The most important thing to remember is that most people (me included) like
to think we're going to race often; few of us actually do!

(I've answered every private email request, but some of you are still
emailing me back that you haven't received a reply.  Sorry, maybe America
Online is too screwed up!  Let me know.)

Will, 

Check to see if you have any lights at the switch for the rear-defog
_or_  the emergency flasher switch.  There is an amber light at the
de-fog, red at the emergency flasher.  

IF there is not, the source of your problem should be at one of those
switches.

The power from the rheostat goes through the hot side of those two switches.

Subject: 356 questions and more

Hello folks.

I am back with a status report from my 356 rebuilld,and have a few
questions too.

My '59 has had a new longitudinal installed,it is a danish quality
part and it does really look good.After a lot of cutting away rusty
parts,it is nice to start replacing them with perfect ones.

Before the classic car boom I guess this car wouldn't be worth
saving.But with todays prices most cars are.(at least when you can do
most work yourself)The floor perimeter was almost gone,and a lot of
repair had to be done in the front around the torsion bar towers,inner
wings etc.The nice about this car is the outer shell,it is almost rust
free and some soldering will be the cure.
Original color is ruby red,brown interior,(I'll use black interior) 60
hp with a 716 tranny.
The only reason I am using black vinyl interior,is that I have planned using
this later in my '60 coupe when I can afford a brown leather interior for
the '59!(...?..)

What I very much would want to know is; 
I want to replace the floor tunnel in my car.The A model floor tunnel
is all 'square' and seems to be pretty much straight forward job for a
skilled panel worker(...I'm letting a pro do this one!)
Is there anyone that have the possibility to send me the measures for
such one??This piece has been replaced and the I am not sure whether
the piece I've removed have thwe correct measures!

If anyone knows,I'd also appreciate any feedback concerning the
thickness of the materials used for different parts in these cars.
It seems some panels are made in 0.8mm and some are 1.0mm.
Can anyone verfiy that this is correct???


At last I'd like any feedback whether this sound crazy,ok,or like a
good buy.
I have looked at a 356B '63.It's for sale at about $10000.There are no
signs of rust,the car recently has had $2000 repairs concerning
rust.It has a 912 engine,good mechanics.The interior is rather good
but the seats are cracked.The tachometer is 'dead',could be anything
really.Steering is good,very stiff front suspension(??????).
The car pulls strong,but there are some gas/ignition problems it puffs
and sparks when 'engine-braking'.It also needs 2 new heater boxes and
maybe also heater valves.
Good,bad or ugly..?????

cheers

Subject: Re: Autothority chip/MFS

I am somewhat biased being an AutoThority dealer but:

What the MFS does is allow air to flow more freely to the engine.
That's prettymuch it.  The chips control spark timmins and fuel
delivery.  Obviously the combination makes power.

Since power is a function of total combustables, displacement, crank
geometry, compression ratio, ignition timing, and exhaust efficiency,
you will get more power from more air/fuel at the proper mixture
ignited at the proper time.  All the other variables are more or less
fixed, unless you want to spend serious dollars.

Will this nuke your engine?  Not any more than making power any other way will.
Autothority kits are known to be safe and not cause denotation.

As for power, I happen to think the mass flow makes a  real difference.  I've seen it at the track and the carerras with it are significantly faster than
stock or chipped models.

As for chips alone - the do soemthing, but I've not seen evidence they
make a substantial imnprovement.  Having a well designed car with a
decent exhaust you don't have alot of options.  From what I've seen,
headers don't do much on a carerra  Short of going to carbs, which will
make your fuel milage go to hell, and make the care emissions
uninspectable, you can't make too many changes to the fuel system.

Subject: synthetic oil


i've been following a lot of the discussions here and elsewhere on synthetic 
vs dinosaur oils and made the switch this past weekend.  pcna rep advised 
that porsche ag has "approved" two synthetics:  Mobile 1 (5-30 and Formula 
15-50) and Valvoline HP 5-30.  they use shell tmo 5-40 in the factory for 
new cars but shell doesn't sell that over here.  a number of people i know 
use amsoil which the pcna rep also liked but couldn't recommend because 
porsche hadn't apporved it yet.  anyway, i went with mobile 1 formula 15-50. 
 i had been using castrol 20-50 - - it is warmer out here in phoenix., you 
know.

after the oil change i noticed that the oil pressure is about 0.5 bar higher 
with revs and a little lower at idle.  pressure now hits 5 when the revs are 
up and 2 - 2.5 at idle.  my question is if this is normal with synthetics or 
is there a problem now?  i also replaced the filter (it's porsche brand).

the car is an 83 911sc with 67k miles and a very solid engine.

thanks.

Prescription:

The fact is that there are not many people out there 
willing to dish out real money for a Porsche these days, 
especially a 968. 

It's a buyer's market! Take full advantage of this fact.
Time is against them. The warranty is wearing out. Their 
capital is sitting/depreciating in the showroom. 
The least you could do is get them down to 30,000.

So, once you have firmly decided to buy, go there
with your checkbook. Say to them that you are 
prepared to buy it on the spot.
Your offer: 30,000 $ Take it or leave it.
Be prepared psychologically to walk out without a deal.

Since Harry Pellow's books are the only books around on the 356/912

Porsches I thought they were pretty darn educational, and the "ABCs"

in the engines from year to year.

I find your remarks about the books kind of distressing, mostly
because I havn't been able to find any other source of information

HELP!!

I'm in the process of replacing the rear torsion bars
on a 1976 911.  Unfortunately, I can't get the spring
plate(radius arm, trailing arm, whatever you want to
call it) separated from the torsion bar.  The inner
splines of the torsion bar came out easily, but I
suspect 18 years of corrosion is preventing me
from getting the thing completely apart.  Of course
now I can't remove the spring plate or the torsion
bar from the car until I get this apart.  Some-
one please offer some advice before I tear into
this thing with a hacksaw!!!  It's not going to be 
pretty.

Thanks for any suggestions!

       Information Systems / Atlanta Center
Subject: lots of questions

I've been on the list for a few weeks. I'm amazed at the knowledge
out there! In order to conserve bandwidth, I've compiled an
assortment of questions. Next time I promise not to be as long-winded.
Thanks in advance for everyone's help.

(1) I'm having trouble setting the CIS adjustment on my '85 911. When I
purchased the car, I noticed that the O2 sensor was disconnected.
According to my local shop, some of the cars "run best" that way.
While the car is smooth and strong, it of course does not pass
emissions (2 % CO, 220 PPM HC) and has less than great fuel economy
(20 mpg). When I connect the sensor, emissions drop to 0 on both
CO and HC, mileage improves to about 24 mpg, but the car "surges"
at constant throttle. Thinking that the mixture was too lean I
turned the adjustment screw clockwise, eventually hitting the stop.
Still, no improvement. Any suggestions? BTW, the stats are from the
local state emmisions shop. No, I don't have my own analyzer.
Would be nice though....

(2) I need to replace my Boge shocks - they're leaking. I use the car
as my daily driver. I may run the car in some drivers ed events this
summer, but I doubt that I'll go much further right away. Should I get
Boge again? Bilsteins? Konis?

(3) The cruise control is "rough", i.e., it oscillates around the set
speed. I'd guess it varies +- 3 mph every 5-10 seconds. I've checked
for slop in the actuator linkage, and it looks OK. I called a California
shop that advertises cruise control repairs in Excellence. They say
the "op-amps" are probably bad, and can recondition the control unit
for $160. Does that sound plausible?

(4) Factory Workshop manuals. Yikes they are expensive. But, my Haynes
manual is pretty bad. (I have a new Bentley manual for my wife's Saab -
it's quite comprehensive.) It looks like I would have to get the volumes
covering my Carrera, and then ALL the previous manuals. I don't have my
catalogs with me, but I think we're talking 11 volumes at $300-500.
Any alternatives?

(5) I'm still learning about maintenance and repairs. My current reading  list
includes Panorama + Upfixin, Excellence, and European Sports Car.
I also may be getting the racing bug, and have started to read
Grassroots Motorsports (I think that's the title, left the copy at home).
Are there any other mags of interest out there?

(6) Anyone going to the Dixie-Tech session in Huntsville Alabama next
month? It's fairly near to me (Atlanta) so I think I'll check it out.

Thanks for everyone's help!!

If anyone is interested in another perspective...I just bought a 1988 Carrera
coupe, and am interested in having it go a little faster, so I called Clay
Dopke of Bavarian Coarch Werkes in Ohio.  People in my PCA region (Motorstadt,
Michigan) have been pleased with his work, so I thought he'd be a good place to
start.  He highly recommends MFS for all the reasons you state, plus, no part
of the car needs to be cannibalized to install the MFS.  Therefore, if you want
to return the car to stock, you can without major hassles.  He noted he has
great success with the MFS on 3.2 L engines, but has not had great success with
using it on the 3.6.  Since I have a 3.2, I did not go into detail with him on
why that was the case.  Others could probably query him or someone else on that
topic if they wished.  Come spring, If I remember, I'll let folks know how I
like it.

    Still sounds like a vaccuum leak.  Have you checked all the *non* FI
related hoses?  The ones that control advance and retard, and any other vaccuum
line, can affect FI in various ways, even if they are not involved in
controlling the FI equipment.  Are you *sure* you hooked them all up correctly?
 How about the large, short manifold hoses?
    Other things to try are mostly electrical.  For your missing, check your
electrical connections.  My 1.8L had an intermittently bad connector on an
injector.  Probably still has problems (don't ask), but it caused hard starting
and missing.  Sometimes.  Also, some of the sensors can go bad or have bad
connections and cause weird problems.
    Perhaps a leaking injector?

Anyone have any ideas on what might keep an otherwise fine 944 from turning

I ran the car on Saturday, put it up on ramps to check the CV joints,drove it 
down and shut it off. Sunday evening I get in to drive off, and the car refuses
to turn over. After 10 minutes, still nothing. I have spark (haven't pulled
plugs yet, but did get spark from a plug hooked up outside the cylinder), and
have fuel can smell it in the muffler), but no turning over. Oh, and I pulled
the distributor and checked to see that the timing belt was not broken (was ok)
.

Any ideas? I let it sit all day today, and it still refuses to kick over. It
feels like vapor lock, but it hasn't gotten over 35 here in MD.
