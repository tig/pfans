Dave -

I'm no 911 expert, but I can look stuff up as well as the next guy.  The
P-in-a-triangle is Porsche's parts trademark.  In '68, the 911's wore 5.5x15
inch rims in both alloy and steel versions.  Originally, the series wore the
same 4.5x15 rims as the 356C.  Whether the 5.5" rims will fit your 356 without
rubbing, I don't know.  If the fit is tight, watch your camber.

And in '68, it is a little known fact that Porsche actually owned GM's Chevrolet
division, through an elaborate arrangement involving off-shore holding
companies.  This was a short-term "position" which Porsche AG and GM undertook
for various mutually beneficial financial (mostly tax) reasons.

FYI:
Sorry no, Annis Porsche/Audi did it for me for free! (nice deal, eh!)  The
shifter was being somewhat balky so I had it checked just before the
5/50 warantee expired on my '86 951.  I was told a "rod" had worn
prematurely and that it may have contributed to the clutch wear, they
checked the clutch anded needed replacing, so they charged PNA for it.

Mailer: Elm [revision: 64.9]


        I replaced the front shocks on my '67 912 with Koni inserts on
        Boge struts. Everything is fine except for a slight banging noise
        when going over bumps. It sounds like metal against metal, even though
        they are as tight as I can get them (if I tighten any more the internal
        shaft spins) and the new bushings were used.

        My guess is that the metal insert inside the two upper rubber bushings 
        hits the top metal washer when it goes over a bump.

        Does anyone have any ideas?

        Thanks,

        Mick.

Thanks, Kevin - I should have known that, but the only other places
I can recall seeing it is cast into the crankcase and on some connecting
rods.  As far as 356's are concerned, that is a pretty rare mark, since 
Porsche farmed out so much of the manufacturing.

I guess that sometime between '64 and '68 Porsche must have started making 
their own wheels.  The wheels on my '64 356C have a mfr. stamp (starts with 
a script L: Leistritz?), but appear identical to the Porsche wheels in every
way except width.

Subject: strange sounds part II

Well, my cool down practice is to come off of the main road to my house
and then cruise the residential streets in a somewhat high gear to
keep the RPM's low and the airflow high.  Once I reach the house, I
then idle the care for (probably) too short a time.  Like 15 seconds
to 30 seconds  The speeds on the residential streets are 30 tops
and typically low 20's.  Just the coast down the driveway and
waiting for the garage door, etc, etc is probably 15 to 30 seconds.
Is that enough?

On the second question, the brrrr sound comes at about the time I
decide to put the car into reverse and back out.  Sometimes its not
until I put the car into 1st and take off.  I'd say
roughly 15 seconds after the engine has started.  I haven't played with
it to see if it is time based or activity based or temperature based.
I also don't know if it always does it.  I notice it in the mornings.

First a question:  Do you have anti-lock brakes?  if so, then I'd be willing
to wager a new 968 that what you are hearing is the anti-lock brake sphere 
being filled.  Look in the engin compartment for a plastic sphere about the
size fo a grapefruit, it should be near the location of the noise.  That's
the ABS reservior, it whirrs when it gets filled.

The fan(s) on my 944 do run after shutting the car off (if it was warm

David -

The Porsche parts logo appears, in my experience, even on parts manufactured for
PAG by other companies.  I'm not sure when they started using it - perhaps
someone else knows.

Dunno about the script "L" - I haven't any 356 books!

Well, since we are on the subject of strange sounds...
I noticed three strange sounds that I don't recall hearing when the car
was much newer.  I have a '89 951, about 24500 miles.

(1) Squeaky sound (fairly low volume) from the rear wheels at low speed. 
This noise has actually been there for quite some time, and I've noticed 
it's getting a bit worse.  This seemed to be the subject of discussion before,
but I didn't pay attention.  It seemed to have something to do with the
polyurathane bushings of some parts? Can someone give me some hint how to 
examine and fix this again?

(2) High pitch hiss from the right side under the hood (facing the car looking
under the hood, it's on your right near the very front end of the car).  I 
can't pin point where exactly.  It sounds like air rushing out of a leaking
hole.

(3) During idle, a fairly noticible vibrating noise from the back of the car. 
It goes away if I push the clutch pedal to the floor.

I've given up on the squealing brakes :-(.  The dealer says it's fine. 
The car is braking fine, I guess it is then.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Violet -

(1) No idea.  Could be a CV joint, could be a bearing.  I would not expect a
rhythmic, periodic squeak from, for example, a sway bar bushing.

(2) Maybe a leak in the air induction system?  Make sure hoses are clamped
tight.  You could diagnose such a problem with either soapy water or a
stethoscope.  Make sure the air filter box is properly closed.

I can't imagine that a leak in the AC would hiss for very long.  Any change in
the feel of your brake pedal?  By "right" I understand you to mean driver side.

(3) This is apparently pretty normal.  I will hear this sort of noise once in a
while when the ambient temp is high and the car is warm, esp. when cruising at
low RPM and low speed after a bit of driving.  A sort of grating, rattling
noise.

Make sure that your manual transmission fluid is topped off properly.  This
involves opening the upper of two 17 mm allen-head plugs on the transmission at
the rear.  The top is the filler, the bottom the drain.  The fluid level should
be 6 to 8 mm. below the bottom edge of the filler hole.  The pinky method is
preferred by respected Porsche mechanics the world over.

You might make the noise go away my switching to a different brand of fluid.  I
have heard mine much less since switching to Mobil synthetic trans. fluid.  (I
tried Swepco before, and found it made shifting much too hard in my car, quite
the opposite of what I had been led to expect.  It might be just thing for 911
and 914 owners, though.)

   The fan(s) on my 944 do run after shutting the car off (if it was warm
   enough), but how does that cool the engine if there is no coolant
   circulating? 

Well, I assume either there is an additional electric pump that runs
when the engine driven one doesn't, or the air blown by the fan cools
the engine (for some cars, that's ALL you need).

It would serve to cool down the "engine room" as it were, and it definitely
cools down the coolant in the radiator.  after all, you might be starting
up the car in five minutes, and every bit of cooling helps.

Wish my 912 could do that...  :-/

Yes, I meant the driver side.  It's not AC for sure; no change in the pedal
feel.   The hiss is actually quite loud compared to the engine sound.  If I
use a stethoscope, I'll be deaf in minutes :-)  I'll check the other things

Subject: strange sounds part III

My '86 951 had generated a hissing sound when the original manifold
cracked a weld from thermal stress.  The hissing was strong when the
engine was warm, but more noticible when the engine was at idle and
hot.  Perhaps the hiss is from the exhaust system or turbine air (if
so equiped).  :-<

There is a 928S with 120k miles and at high rpm (>4k) blue smoke
and loss of power exits.  Checked timing and was off by 6 degress,
too advanced (also noticed a significant help with octane booster).

The mechanic who tuned up the car didn't realised it was European
model and timed it for a US.

With the official correct timing, i slight improvment, but still
not what it should be.  About 2-3 degrees more retard. Even better
improvment, with very little blue smoke at exhaust.

Question: is the ignition ditributor bad?
	  could a weak peul pump cause such a prob?
	  bad injectors?
	  or simply a worn engine?

p.s. 1981 928S M21/11 engine 4.7l with 10.0 to 1 compression.

Thanks for any help or hints.

Finally, a question I can answer!  All you need to do it 'shorten' one
or both of the hatch catches (sorry, can't think of a suitably technical
name off hand -- they're just bolts with a lock nut). A half turn or
so should do the trick.

Steve, Chris -

Right, the two cone-headed bolts can be adjusted with a 13 mm. wrench.  Before
loosening them, find which side (if not both) is loose.  Do this by pushing down
on the air dam above each bolt & catch, and see which side rattles and by how
much.  Then adjust, probably a quarter turn at a time.  Put a reference mark on
the bolt before you start turning.

I find that this is a seasonal adjustment.  I drive my car all year, and what's
right for winter often isn't for summer.  Some folks spray a little WD-40 into
the jaws and find this helps ensure a better release.

Porsche gave up on this "automatic" release.  They issued a tech bulletin a
couple years ago which stated that it was never their intention that the hatch
pop up in response to a flick of the switch in the driver's footwell.  Moreover,
the owner's manual documentation to the contrary was in error and would be
corrected forthwith!

There are probably a couple other things which can rattle in the rear.  A friend
with a Turbo S has always had problems with the hatch's glass rattling in the
frame, particularly at the top.  He got Porsche to replace the whole hatch once,
and still wasn't satisfied.  He then tried shimming between the glass and its
frame with thin bits of cardboard - the strips in which single-edge industrial
razors come wrapped.  This worked temporarily until the shim caused the frame to
widen further, putting him back at square one.  He's now leaving well enough
alone.  I would guess that with a lot of labour someone could disassemble the
mess and get busy with caulk, and really stop the rattle.

Another source of rattles can be the connectors behind the carpeting.  There are
two for the lamp assemblies (I think) left and right, just inside the cubbies. 
I wrapped them around with some foam rubber, then tie-wrapped them to available
metal.  You might also check the moon roof electrics, if you have one, behind
the carpet on the driver-side wall.

Check the fold-down rear seats for proper locking into the studs coming out of
the C pillar.  Check that the jack and donut are tight.  The jack gets locked in
by "raising" it enough to lock it into its bracket.  Check that all the snaps on
the removable carpet are engaged.

Anything else back there...?

Kevin, Steve, Chris -

In addition to the mentioned:
   cone-headed bolts 
   hatch's glass rattling 
   connectors behind the carpet
   the moon roof electrics behind the carpet on the driver-side wall.
   rear seats for proper locking into the studs coming out of the C pillar.  
   jack and donut are tight
   all the snaps on the removable carpet are engaged.

I'd like to add the D ring that is for luggage tie-down. While it can 
create only a slight rattle, it can be annoying.

Bob "my $.02 worth" Pentecost

P.S. I've been plagued with a rattle for a long time and have tightened
the bolts probably to the point of making them too tight. I'll check Kevin's
other suggestions. I hope it's not the glass rattling in the frame.

The seatbelt light in my 81 911SC has begun coming on once in a while
all be itself as I'm driving.  It stays on for anywhere between about
5 seconds and 30 seconds then goes off.  Do I just have loose wire
contacts someplace or is the seatbelt light tied to something not obvious

other things than what it is labeled for.

Subject: Blue smoke



	There is a 928S with 120k miles and at high rpm (>4k) blue smoke
	and loss of power exits.  Checked timing and was off by 6 degress,
	too advanced (also noticed a significant help with octane booster).

	The mechanic who tuned up the car didn't realised it was European
	model and timed it for a US.

	With the official correct timing, i slight improvment, but still
	not what it should be.  About 2-3 degrees more retard. Even better
	improvment, with very little blue smoke at exhaust.

	Question: is the ignition ditributor bad?
		  could a weak peul pump cause such a prob?
		  bad injectors?
		  or simply a worn engine?

	p.s. 1981 928S M21/11 engine 4.7l with 10.0 to 1 compression.


I'm probably going to regret asking this!,  but what difference does the timing make to the amount of oil being burnt??

While i'm here, has anybody seen these Porsche Spyder copies that are available. I've seen one available in America, one in Britain and a couple in Germany. 

I sent for details of the one in England and it looks quite good. its a copy of the 718RSK and the quality of the mouldings etc, and the interior trim looks quite good. It's based of course on the Beetle, retaining it's (shortened) chassis. There is a mid-engined version available with a special chassis for which they recommend a Porsche engine. It could look quite realistic with this chassis and a 356 motor sitting in the middle! The VW based version is fairly cheap too, costing around 2000 GBP plus the donor vehicle.

Yes, I've seen the 718RSK replicas in magazines.  There is a repl.
of the 550A spyder made by a character called Beck.  There are ads
for this car in all of the favorite kit car mag's.  Hot Rod, Car and 
Driver, and one other mag all did reviews in the mid to late eighties.
Check out some of these.  Of course the car is based on the shortened
bug pan and engine, but with a larger type I, the test car could light
up at will.  Guess the 550 repl. beat the Corvette at the Lat Accel tests,
and almost matched the best slalom and braking times.

Yes, I saw several fine examples at the VW show in Lawrence MA last month.
All were 550 Spyder replicas (the James Dean car...) and looked varying degrees
of "stunning". The one that was parked behind the Ghia we were showing was
as perfect a replica of the actual J.D. car (before the crash, of course) as
I would think possible, right down to the lugnuts. I had seen photos before,
and the matchup was spectacular.

My friend tells me that the "air box" on his 911 "blew", and the dealer

if he does, I'll be helping him. This is a FI 911. I'll get the year and

Subject: Webers or FI

In looking for a more powerful intake system for my 914 2.0, everyone tells
me that the best way to make power is to go with dual weber 40IDF's.
However, everyone also says that the engine is undrivable with the Webers.
The off-throttle to on-throttle transition is apparently awful.  Anyone have
any opinions on that?

I have a strong dislike for the Bosch D-Jetronic that's on the car (stock).
I might consider going to another Bosch system.  Not CIS (K, K-Jet or
KE-Jet), 'cause I don't like that either.  I know nothing about L.  Or maybe
a mechanical system, like that on the 2002tii?

Actually, I think the best bet is to go with aftermarket fuel injection,
like Haltech.  Has anyone tried Haltech on a VW or Porsche motor?

What's the difference between Weber IDA's and IDF's?  People recommend the
IDF's for the 914 2.0, but I already have a pair of IDA's.

Thanks for any input you can provide...

I recently traded a 914 2.0 with FI (and chassis rot) for another 2.0 with
Weber 40IDF's (and no chassis rot).  I found no such problem with
off/on-throttle transition.  The two negatives that I noted were increased
noise (Webers are LOUD under full throttle) and less crisp off-idle
acceleration.  On the other hand, my carbureted engine is noticeably
stronger in the midrange than my FI engine was (both engines had > 100K
miles on them.)  Maybe my car is the exception, but it idles well, starts
well and runs smoothly.  Now if it would just quit leaking oil! :-)

>From what I gather (from talking to engine builders), the reason to go to
carbs is that the FI can't flow enough air to satisfy an engine running a
hotter cam or big bore pistons.

Why do you dislike D-Jetronic?  It isn't very adjustable, so you're stuck
with the stock cam, but it is incredibly reliable, it's quiet, and it's
pretty simple.  If you do decide to go with carbs, PLEASE call me!  I'll
buy your FI setup if it's in good shape.  I'd like to convert back to FI
when I rebuild my engine, but I don't know where to buy a good FI setup
for a reasonable price.

I, too, would like to hear about Haltech.

Subject: Roll bars

I've been avoiding adding a roll bar to my '87 944 turbo because I
really don't want to cut holes in my car. I'm starting to get more and
more serious about track driving (4 or 5 events a year) and my better
judgement says that I really ought to have one. I also 'need' a harness
as I'm getting tired of the lower back pain that results from trying to
hold myself in the seat w/out one.  This weekend, I saw what might be an
answer.

A local company custom fabricates a roll bar that bolts into the car in
preexisting bolts (the outer two rear seat belt bolts, and the upper and
lower shoulder harness bolts. It's fairly expensive (>$500), but it would
not require modifying my car at all. I saw it mounted in both an '87 911
cabriolet and an '87 951.

I'm concerned that this roll bar, while satisfying my desire to not have
to cut holes in my car, is probably not strong enough to justify putting
it in the car... I have no plans on racing - just drivers schools - so
there's no rule based reason not to add it (though they claim that it is
SCCA approved). I just don't want to get a false sense of security from
this bar...

Can anyone comment on such roll bars? I've called around to most of the
shops that advertise in Pano, Excellence, and Grass Roots Motorsports. A
couple claimed to make such bars for other cars (not the 951), a few
tried to talk me out of it, most just sounded intrigued by the concept.

My experience is with DCOEs, not IDFs.	From talking with people and seeing
different types of setups, drivability problems seem to be mostly a matter
of the throttle transition you mention, and seem to be generally not the
fault of the carb, but rather of the linkage.  All other problems are
allegedly a matter of tuning.

Linkage design/geometry seems to be a matter of great importance, but
often of little attention.

I do have sources available.

Subject: Webers or FI


Webers idle fine, if they are adjusted and balanced correctly.  The
problem is that not everyone knows how to adjust them correctly.\, and
thus the carbs get blamed.  If you buy webers, they have an 800 number
you can call which is excellent, if you get the right guys, they will
even talk you through some of the adjustment process.

Clearly carbs have worse cold start and cold idle performance than FI,
FI is usually better when conditions vary a lot.  the main problem
with carbs is that they can only be tuned to give optimal performance
for a specific load/temperature/rpm range, whereas FI can be
confugured to give opitmal performace through a broader range of
conditions.  The better the FI, the braoder that range.

Carbs are simpler to adjust than FI, but require adjustment more
often.  The power gain is easier with carbs, you have do do a bit more
to make an FI system boost performance, and there are not a lot of
tried and true FI upgrade kits like there are for carbs.  To do any
fuel delivery system upgrade you should have access to a dyno, its the
ONLY way to tune a setup, unless you are installing a kit that has
already been configured (like the Weber conversion kits from PMO),
which have already been dyno tested.

If you convert from FI to carbs, or to another Fi system, you should
have the heads ported.  If you're kit doesn't include intake
manifolds, its not a very good kit, and you'll have to get new ones or
have your existing ones ported as well.  The FI on the 914 has some
pretty restrictive air passages.

Advanced FI systems blow carbs away, there is no question about that.
But they're more expensive, and again, I don't know of any proven FI
upgrades for the VW type engines.  The weber conversion is common,
proven, and fairly easy to do, and there is a NOTICABLE improvement in
performance, especially in the high RPM range.  It's louder,
especially at high throttle, since you have a more direct channel to
the cylinders, but some people prefer the sound (like me).

THe CIS, motronic, and the Bosch MFI systems are all good FI systems.
Any of these can be modified to take any cam setup, including
overlapping, and the heads and manifolds can be ported (or changed)
for better airflow.

Subject: Engine rebuild



   >About how much would it cost to get a 1982 Porsche 911SC Targa engine
   >rebuilt?

I helped a friend rebuilt a 3L SC engine over the summer, and he spent
about $4K on it, and I didn't charge him for labor.  He had the heads
ported, and drilled for twin plug, and kept the P/Cs.  I would say the
price is going to vary depending on how much you want/have to do, anywhere
from about $2K to infinity.  So the real question is why do you need
it rebuilt.  Don't forget, $2k is parts/machining only, not labor.
Typical shop costs for a full but minimal rebuild run around $5K.

   And on the same note. Would it be a better idea to buy one with less miles
   for more $$ or more miles, less $$, and rebuild it in a couple years?

That would depend on you.  I prefer the latter, but I do my own work.

Subject: "blown air box"


   My friend tells me that the "air box" on his 911 "blew", and the dealer
   wants $4000 to fix it. This seems rather a lot, and I would like to
   know what's  involved. Not only am I curious, but he is tempted to try
   the job himself, and if he does, I'll be helping him. This is a FI
   911. I'll get the year and options if they are important. I also was
   wondering if this might be a good  time to change to Webers...


$4K????????  Are you sure it's just the airbox?  Also, you need to
find out why the airbox blew.  Usually this is a sign of a leak
somewhere.  Changing the airbox is trivial, but it never blows unless
something is wrong.

Subject: Webers or FI


Hi there. I just got to this part of my mailbox :-). I had a 1.7 with FI that
I had removed to install a twin Weber kit. I was so happy with the setup that
when I sold the car to get another one, I kept the carbs and installed them
on the new one. I think Christopher pretty much said what I wanted to say
(albeit in a much more coherent way (-:) wrt the Webers. I haven't had any
problems with the idle, and the performance is noticeably improved. As for
the loudness, well, 914s are not known for their quiet purring engines, and,
as a matter of fact, the sound (not noise) increase is a feature, not a bug
(for you computer science types).

If you decide on FI, please let me know. We're working on injecting a Ninja
engine for a FSAE open wheeler, and I'll probably have more info in a couple
of weeks. I'm looking at the Haltech stuff right now, but I'm still looking
around for others. Haltech makes at least two types. The F7 takes throttle
position, air intake temp., engine temp, RPM and battery V. The F3 has the
same inputs as the F7, but gives you the option of taking manifold vac/press
instead of throttle position. They're $$$$. The F7 will run you ~$1,400
retail, whereas the F3 goes for ~$2,000 retail. Another cheaper option is to
look at FI from 4-cyl cars from the big three. We have modified the FI from
an Escort, and it looks like it can work. Just food for thought. In any case,
good luck, and let us know. Take care.

Steve -

Autopower makes both a bolt-in and a non-bolt-in cage for 944 series cars. 
Tweaks carries them, and you can probably find a cheaper source.  The one you
described which uses the rear seat-belt points sounds humourous but not much
else!  The points were designed to keep you in a seat, not the pavement out of
your car.

I too am growing interested in getting a cage.  I would like to do it without
destroying the car.  The hope would be that, where carpet needs to be excised,
it can be done in such a way that the squares can be glued back in, in the
future, inconspicuously.  And where interior trim needs removal/cutting, it can
be replaced.  Let me know what you learn.

If putting a five- or six-point harness in your car is your goal, I highly
recommend (and probably have done so before) the bar made by European
Performance Engineering in Natick, MA.  Two telescoping tubes with flanges at
the end.  The flanges are holed to piggyback on the bolts which hold the factory
harness into the B pillar.  Your shoulder straps loop over the bar and clip to
eyes substituted for the rear lap belt.  Call 'em at 508 651 1316.  Inexpensive.

Subject: Info about 911s

The 911 has been near the top of my list of cars-that-I-have-to-own-someday,
and now I'm finally in the position where I can afford one (at least, an
older one).

Based on some very sketchy info about different engines in the cars, I think
I want a 911 S/Carrera/SC of some vintage.  What I think I know is that:
	'72-'73 had a 2.4
	'74 had a 2.7 with FI (and new bumpers)
	'75-'77 had poor power due to emissions requirements
	'78+ had the 3.0 with FI

Now, I hate carbs, so I'm tempted to say that the car I want is a '74 911S
(or is it a Carrera in '74?), or a '78+ but that would probably cost too
much money.  Also, I know I want a coupe (hopefully with a sunroof) because
although I love top-down/off motoring, I like the way the coupe looks a lot
more.

Anyway, this would be primarily for use as a fun street car, but knowing me
it would get some autocross time as well (in a stock class).  Given all of
that, would someone care to fill me in on some of the year-to-year
differences, and make some recommendations about just what kind of 911 I
*really* want?

I think it's safe to say that I want a car from sometime during the '70s ...
later ones are too expensive and earlier ones are too wimpy.

Thanks for all of the wonderful info that I'm sure I'm about to get!

Josh,

About 3 years ago, I went through exactly what you are going through now.

I wanted a 911 and thought an early '70s car would best suit me.

After 15 months of research and shopping, I bought a 1980 911sc (coupe
with sunroof!).

Your first step, after reading all your mail, is to buy a copy of Bruce
Anderson's book "911 Performance Handbook."  Read it cover to cover.

Anderson is the 911 National Tech Committee Chairman for the PCA.  He 
knows A LOT about the car.

Here's what I know about the years you mention:

'72-'73     2.4 liter.  Fairly dependable.  '73(1/2?) 911T is the first
911 to use the CIS FI instead of the mechanical FI.

'74         2.7 liter.  The first year of the engine from hell.  This is
the best of the 2.7 liter cars.  CIS injection and no smog pump.  The 2.7
liter engine has this nasty habit of pulling the cylinders away from the 
case.  This problem may be corrected by installation of Divlar (sp?) 
inserts in the case where the cylinder rods (not connecting rods) attach.
When the engine is working correctly, this should be a really fun car.  It
is lighter than the later 2.7 and 3.0 cars, and has good power.  The problem
is the relatively short engine life.

'75-'77     2.7 liter.  The true 911's from hell.  To reduce emmissions, 
these cars have smog pumps, thermal reactors in the exhaust, and God knows
what else.  They fans were also down sized to RUN THE ENGINE HOTTER to 
reduce emmissions.  Can you say "stupid?"  I would only buy one if the 
engine had been replaced with a 3.0.

'78-'79     3.0 liter.  Great engine.  Bad clutch, the rubber centered
"exploding" clutch.  The fix is to replace the clutch with a later model
clutch (spring centered).  The '78 also had poor inner valve springs.  They
break.  I'm told the symptom of a broken spring is that the car will not rev.
above 5500.  The springs may be replaced with the engine in the car.  The '79
may or may not have the bad springs.

'80-'83     3.0 liter.  New FI, the K-Jetronic with Lambda (oxygen) sensor.
This car has a 3 way catalist and an oxy sensor.  The exhaust oxygen content
is fed back into the FI and the mixture adjusted from this information.  On 
my last smog check, the highest emmission was about 11% of allowable, with 
most about 3% of allowable.  No smog pump.  I think this is the first non-
bandaid emmission control on a 911.

The 3.0 liter engines should last about 200,000 miles without any major work.
The earlier engines don't last as long, with the 2.7 having the shortest life.
Anderson says one can expect to put a new top end in a 2.7 at around 70,000
miles, and a new bottom end every other top end.  This sound pesimistic to me, 
but I've never owned that car (and don't plan to either...).

I bought my 1980 with 103,000 miles on it.  The compression was between 158 and
162 psi across all 6 cylinders.  I have since come to question that the mileage
is correct as the speedo may have been replaced (does anyone know if the 1980 
911s came ever came with a 150 mph speedo?).

All 911's before the '84 Carrera should update to the '84 chain tensioners.
I think Imparts has the best price on the kit ($359 including shipping).

Another shopping tip, learn where the engine type number is and be sure that
the car has the correct engine.  Again, Anderson's book discusses this in 
detail.  I recently looked at an alledged '68 911S.  It was a '68 US version
with a 2.2 liter '70 or '71 911T engine.

If you can afford it, I would go with a 1980 or later car.  You probably want 
to spend about $13k - $15k minimum.  If you buy for less, you will probably
end up spending more later.

Anyway, best of luck.

I'm thinking of putting an electronic (optical trigger) ignition on my
stock '74 914 2.0 and am interested to hear others' experiences with
points vs. optical ignitions.

In order of importance to me: 

	Easy, Reliable Starting
	Smooth Running
	Ease of Maintenance
	Power

It looks like the Allison kit will cost me about $130-150.  Is it a
good kit?  Are there better?

Thank you so much,

This month's _Excellence_ magazine had an article written by Bruce Anderson
on performance chips for the 911 Carrera.  The different chips gave anywhere 
between a 5 and 9 horsepower increase over stock.  I was disappointed in
reading this because I had been thinking about doing this and was expecting
big increases.

I guy I run with at the track with has a 944 Turbo with a chip and it makes
a big difference.

Lets here from people who have them.

 I happen to have the autothority chip.
 
 Gas milage: Performance driving (track) 6mpg
             Performance driving (street) 18mpg
             Highway driving (long dist@65) 27 mpg
 
 Highway got better by about 1.5 mpg, normal street down by 1.5 mpg,
 track down by 3mpg.
 
 Performance specs: major difference in bottom end torque, usable boost
 at about 3200 vs 4000 RPM for stock.  MUCH improved accelleration.  0-60
 from 6.0 to about 5.0, but the real story is what happens in 3rd gear
 from 50----> 110mph.  Car is VERY fast, like just look in th rear veiw
 for the stock 951 or corvette that was just next to you.
 
 217 hp --> 278 (real) hp makes a major improvement.  This is running
 about .8 bar boost peak.
 
 Can't say enough good about the performance.  I would say, however, that
 MObil 1 is a must.
 
 As far as I can say, Autothority chips are it, at least that has been my
 experience and that of the track junkies I run with.
 
 If you decide to go for them, it may be wise to contact me (yes I am an
 authorized dealer) though I really could care less since I pass most of
 my discount along to the buyer.  Anyway, I recommend them and have run
 them for about 2 years.  I may be a bit biased but those are my honest
 impressions.
 
 Call autothority for a spec sheet.  Ask for larry bernstein and tell him
 I referred you.  He know me and my car well.
 
 Good luck.  If you have any specifics feel free to email me directly.

The reason the 944 gets such a big boost is due to the KLR (i.e. Turbo
Wastegate) reprogramming.

Carl et al,

My two cents worth.  The chips are indeed very worthwhile in turbocharged cars,
but not worth their cost in the aspiros.  Almost all the gain is from upping the
turbo boost.  Porsche and Bosch have done their homework, and aside from running
a higher boost, there is not a lot more to be found in the engine by itself.  A
little is gained by assuming a higher fuel quality, apparently.

In the 951, the current generation (2.5) Autothority chip seems, from all
reports, to be a safe and rewarding enhancement.  Earlier versions, notably the
version 2.2, were problematic.  A friend lost his head gasket with the 2.2 chip,
and if memory serves he was far from the only victim.  You should also avoid any
upgrades which involve drilling out the cycling valve or shimming the waste
gate.  Modifying either inhibits the engine management system's ability to
protect the engine from overboost.

I have heard a number of reports of driveability problems with the Autothority
chips in Carreras.  One friend went through three or four versions from them
(last time I asked) trying to get something which worked.  I don't know anyone
who thinks the chip makes much difference in a Carrera.

I put a chip in my 944S only because I got it second-hand and very cheaply from
someone else (who was selling his car w/out the chip).  Imho, there is a small
improvement in low-end response, and none at all at the torque curve peak.  I
could be imagining things.  Between Porsche's reputation for understating their
cars' power, and Autothority's optimism, I can well imagine there is zero gain
in the upper parts of the torque curve.  I don't think it has helped my
autocrossing an iota.  (Then again, not much would.)  I have heard that dyno
tests are quite variable from one dyno to another.

One thing their chips do is increase the redline (actually, the rev limiter RPM
point).  I am not sure that it is a good thing to make use of this.  It is a
pretty safe bet that Porsche has chosen the redline carefully, and going beyond
it is likely to significantly increase wear and tear, especially at the track. 
(My Bosch CSE mechanic got pretty upset with me when I told him I was using the
extra headroom.  The above is a paraphrase of what he told me.)

Regarding Larry Bershtein (sp?, but definitely not "Bernstein"), Steve.  I have
twice talked to him, and twice he has fed me what was to me obvious
misinformation.  I don't know whether it is because he is not very technical and
didn't know, or it is because he was intentionally dissembling.  Doesn't really
matter.  There are smart, technical people at Autothority, but Larry isn't one
of them.

Larry did make one good point to me when we spoke at this year's Parade.  It was
that people don't appreciate that when you modify your car, you are indeed going
to affect its life expectancy.  He thinks that their chips were perhaps
underpriced in that, given their cost and ease of installation, buyers don't
look at them as a "serious" upgrade to their cars.

Anyone who has driven a Carrera knows that the RPM limiter is set
artificially low, (something like 6200, if I remember right).  The
chip on these cars makes them far more driveable at the track, since
at 6200 you are always hitting the limiter, and the Motronic limiter
is nasty.  If you're not paying close attention and you hit in in a
corner...well, say no more.

Does anyone have any knowledge of or experience with this part?  The new
Performance Products catalog advertises them as a cure for hot running, without
making any more specific claims.  I have no problem with cooling except at the
track in mid-summer, where I have had to cut short my runs due to overheating.

I have a 944 Turbo S.  I installed the Autothority Chip and found that
it made a HUGE difference in the performance.  The throttle response was
greatly improved at all rpm's, the low-end torque was much better, and
the boost gets increased to 2.0 to give you more at the top.  

If you are going to the track a lot, you will probably need to replace
your number two bearing a little sooner than if you left your car stock. 
IMHO, I think that the improvement in the driveability of the car and
the increase at the top end makes this a no-brainer.

Incidently, I have 20,000 miles after installation of the chip.  I have
had no problems with the engine, turbo, etc...just normal maintenance.

Subject: 951 #2 rod bearings

Lately, I've been hearing lots of advice at the track to keep my oil
('87 Porsche 951) 1/4 to 1/2 quart overfull in order to prevent the #2
rod bearing from getting oil starved in high G situations. Is this
generally considered good advice? Do the bottom parts of the rods
actually dip in the oil reserve in the pan? Also, is there any way to
know that the #2 bearing is 'about to go' without pulling the oil pan
and looking at it? That is, are there noises or other external
indications of imminent failure?

No, I don't have any experience with the radiator, but what I know
about it is that it is all copper and repairable, unlike the aluminum
and plastic radiators that are all the rage today.

I first noticed the "hotlaps at Lime Rock" overheating problem running
one-hour rungroups at our track event there in August on a 95 degree
day.  My first guess was changing the thermostat, thinking that the
original ('83) was sticking.  To my surprise, the gauge sat even
higher.  With the original thermostat in hand, I then went to my
local foreign autoparts store looking for a cooler one.  I managed to
find a 170 degree stat (versus the original 190 degree) made by the
same OEM for one third of the PCNA price.  I installed it and have had
no trouble since then.

I am also running the lower temperature thermoswitch I found at
Performance Products ("activates the radiator fan 25 degrees sooner")
with no problem other than the noise of the fan running most of the
time.

Overall, the car runs cooler, and when I do track it, the gauge moves
a bit higher, but does not get anywhere near where it did before.

P.S. There was no lasting damage caused from the "overheating".
The car still runs fine.

Subject: hello, and misc



Hello.  I am new to the porschephiles mailing group, so I thought I would
share  some  of my experiences.  I now have a 1989 944S2.  Before that  I
had a 1985 944.  I love both cars deeply.

I  belong to PCA (NNJR region) and go to the track a few times each  year
-- usually Lime Rock.

The  944  was somewhat low on power so I got an Autothority chip for  it,
which  helped  dramatically.   (15 HP, I think.) The car was  crisper  in
regular  traffic and pulled better on the track as well.  I have only the
best  things to say about this product.  It had no ill effects at all.  I
also  got a semi-racing brake pad since there was much brake fade at  the
track,  although there were no other problems with the stock pads.  I got
a  Stable  Energies  bar  for  the front end.   This  made  a  noticeable
difference  on  the track in reducing understeer and steering effort.   I
really  liked it.  I replaced the stock Pirelli P6 tires with Bridgestone
RE71.   I found these really good at the track, particularly in the rain.
On  the  Pirellis  the car was extremely skittery in the wet,  while  the
Bridgestones  really had grip.  However, I found the car had been  easier
to  pitch  and throttle regulate with the Pirellis than with  the  RE71s.
Overall, though, there was no contest:  The RE71s are much better.

When I got the 944S2, I was amazed at the increase in power.  This car is
really  fast.  I may put in a chip sometime, but even stock it has plenty
of  zip.   It came with Pirelli P700 tires.  These seem good in  dry  and
wet, but I feel somewhat uncomfortable on the track with them.  They just
seem  dodgy, as in the lefthander after Big Bend.  Can anyone comment  on
these tires?  What do people use as tire pressures?  I never know what to
do.

Here  are  2 cautions:  I got another Stable Energies bar for the  944S2.
(It  isn't compatible with the 944 bar.) Its mounting plate was  slightly
too  tall for my car.  (Evidently there are production differences  among
cars.)  This had the effect of leaving an insufficient amount of  threads
to  grip, and I ruined the tops of the vertical bolts.  This means that I
can now never install one of these bars because the threads are stripped.
So  beware!   An  even more serious problem occurred at the  track:   The
stock  brake  pads  partially melted and bonded onto  the  rotors.   This
created bumps on the rotors which made the car feel like a bucking bronco
whenever the brakes were applied after a few laps at the track, and for a
few  weeks thereafter.  (Then the material must have melted away, because
the  problem disappeared until I next went to the track.) I then replaced
the  pads with Ferodo semi-racing pads and have had no problems since.  I
have  been told by knowledgeable people that I came quite close to needed
a  rotor grinding, which would have spoiled my day.  The ABS is great, by
the  way.   I  can  dive into Big Bend full speed in the  rain  with  the
assurance  that  the  car will slow in a straight line.  This  is  a  big
comfort.

I  read  in  a  message yesterday in this mail  group  that  someone  was
overheating  at Lime Rock.  I, too, was there in August in the  95-degree
weather.  (It may have been the same day --- the 2-day mid-week session.)
I  paid attention to the temperature on a number of the 944 family.   The
944s  were  all  very hot.  The 944S/S2 were cool.  They  have  obviously
improved the cooling system.  It was VERY HOT!

Here's  another interesting thing:  My old 944 got wet in the back of the
hatch.  Water leaked into the tail-lights and shorted them out.  Also the
back area got mildewed.  I couldn't figure it out for a long time, then I
realized  that water was entering around the shaft of the rear wiper.   I
removed the motor -- a screwdriver job -- packed the bushing in Vaseline,
and re-installed.  The problem went away completely.

An  offer:  If anyone wants the Autothority linear throttle device for an
older  944, contact me with mailing info.  I used this thing for a while,
but  ultimately  removed it.  The stock throttle is non-linear:   At  the
early  part of gas pedal travel you do not get a corresponding amount  of
true  throttle  action.  Porsche does this, I guess, for 2 reasons.   The
car  is easy to start from rest smoothly, and it probably gets better mpg
in  the traffic cycle.  With the linear device, the action is  completely
linear.   I did stop using it, though, because I found it harder to drive
the  car in traffic.  However, there was a decided improvement in low-end
power -- all psychological, but noticeable nonetheless.

Fred -

There's hope for your shock bearing bolts, the ones which were a little too
short and got stripped.  Have your mechanic knock them out of the shock bearings
and replace them with longer, conventional M8 bolts.  He'll have to tack weld
their heads to the bearing.  I did this to get enough grip (plus some to spare)
for the bar. Piece of cake.

Regarding your rotors, you suffer from what I have heard called "material
transfer," that is, bonding of pad material to the rotor surface.  This used to
happen to me too.  Feels just like a warped rotor, but with a few hundred miles
of street use, the vibration disappears as you wear the transferred material off
the rotors.  Changing pads will help, but proper ducting of air onto the rotors
will really help.  Do the S2's not come with such ducting?

Date: Thu, 17 Oct 91 7:39:52 PDT
Message-Id:  <9110170739.aa00796@wvus.wvus.org>

I've noticed more and more "clunking" over bumps in my '69 912 (stock 
suspension except for a small anti-sway bar in the front - none in the 
rear, 95k miles).  Yesterday I took the car to my Porsche mechanic (whom 
I trust) - he inspected the car and says my torsion bar bushings are worn - 
both ends of the car.  He claims about 5-1/2 hours labor to replace all 
of them (4 hrs rear, 1-1/2 hrs front).

Then I'll need a complete suspension alignment of course, as the entire
front and rear ends will be disassembled.

Questions:

* does this sound reasonable?
* should I have him replace front shocks (the right one feels weak)?  Seems
  as though I'd save some labor hours, both in the suspension disassembly
  and with alignment costs.
* is it worth a few extra $$ to put in heavier torsion bars?  no, i don't
  want stiff-mondo handling, but one notch stiffer would be nice.  No, I
  don't race/autox or plan to in the near future - my 912 is just a daily 
  driver  :-) .

...advice, anecdotes, all greatly appreciated.

   * does this sound reasonable?

Well, it's reasonable for what he's doing.  The problem is that when
the bushings wear, they are frequently "repaired" by replacing the
bushing only (in the rear), but you should really replace the entire
spring plate.  The reason is that the bushing is made part of the
spring plate through a special process (is it vulcanized, I don't
remember), and you can never get the replacement bushing to adhere the
same way.  As a result, this is a quick fix that wont last five years.

   * should I have him replace front shocks (the right one feels weak)?  Seems
     as though I'd save some labor hours, both in the suspension disassembly
     and with alignment costs.

Make sure the problem *is* the bushing.  These clunking noises can
also be the CV, the shock, your differential, your bearing, or your
sway bar.  Replacing the shock in the front doesn't require a
re-alignment, so change it when you think it needs to be changed.

   * is it worth a few extra $$ to put in heavier torsion bars?  no, i don't
     want stiff-mondo handling, but one notch stiffer would be nice.  No, I
     don't race/autox or plan to in the near future - my 912 is just a daily 
     driver  :-) .

I wouldn't change it to heavier bars if you're not going to race it.
The heavier bar is a serious comfort loss, as well as putting more
stress on the body.

Subject: Shocking news....

Porschephiles,

In late September, when I was mainly out of town, I recieved a mail 
offer from Doug Quara (quara@encore.com)  that I think may interest 
many of you. (Many of you may already know about it, since I've been
soooo slow in getting this posted...)

Bottom  line: Bruce McVay at The Shock Warehouse has offered tohelp
support Team.Net in autox and general car stuff by offering a big
serious discount to anyone who calls up, mentions the Team.Net offer,
and basicly asks for the discount. I think the deal was that we get
shop prices on the parts, but I can't find that bit of mail. 

Anyway, the nubmer is 800 245-SHOX. They have Bilstein, Koni, KYB, 
and Boge shocks, Heckethorn off-road shocks, Eibach suspensions, and 
other related items.

Some examples follow. Caveat emptor, y'all.

After discussing some prices/sources with stan, it became apparent that
these may not be the best prices going.  Imparts sells the Koni package
for $350 (versus $450 above) including shipping.  Sebring Automotive
seems to have the best prices (about $310 last time I checked).

Koni "List" is usually WAY off.  For example, for the 944 turbo, front
shocks list at $360 each, rears at $115,  the package can be had for
about $390 (or so, at least that's what I paid mail order), which means
thay are selling about 60% off list.  Perhaps list on the fronts have
dropped but even so...to give an example, Automotio gets $731 for the
turbo set up, which is absurd, and $523 for 944, which is 24% and 14%
off list, respectively.  On any of their "sale saturdays" you can knock
20% off of the above, which is still $60 over Imparts, PLUS shipping.

Anyway, I think the KYB setup is right around $100, at least that's what
a non-connected freind paid.

Sebring is listed is just about ever Autoweek at 1-900-248-1133 and also
has great priced on Repco Metalmaster pads ($32/28 for 951S, 28 for
951/930 if you mention PCA)

Subject: Porsche going down?

FYI, I was reading through Oct. Ward's Automotive Report and ran across a couple
news items that might be of interest to this list:


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEZ OUT AS PORSCHE'S R&D DIRECTOR

Porsche AG returns to turmoil as Ulrich Bez, recently named research and 
development director, is ousted.  Mr. Bez, who joined Porsche with great
fanfare a year ago after running BMW Technik, apparently became the fall
guy for the failure of Porsche's Formula One engine program.  (He is the 
third member of Porsche's management board to leave in the last few months.)
The Japanese based Footwork team, which used and then discarded Porsche's
engine earlier this year, has decided not to run the powerplant in 1992,
effectively killing the program a year into a three-year contract.  Sources
say the engine has been permanently withdrawn from competition, a MAJOR
EMBARRASSMENT to Porsche.


CAN PORSCHE GO IT ALONE AS PROFITS AND SALES SINK?

Porsche vows to remain independent despite its prediction that profits will
fall to between $29.9 million and $35.8 million (DM50 million to DM60 million)
in the fiscal year that ended July 31.  Porsche registered a $40.96 million
profit in 1990.  However, there are persistent rumors that Mercedes-Benz AG
or Volkswagen AG may buy the company.  Executives at VW and Mercedes say they
would be interested in buying Porsche if the controlling family decided to sell.
Porsche sales fell 18%, to 26,300 units in the fiscal year that ended July 31.

Porsche, nothing even comes close (sarcasm?)

There was a report on PAG in either the Times or the Journal in the last few
weeks.  While sales are down in the US, they are very much up in Europe.  If
memory serves, there was a net 3% decline in annual revenues worldwide.

The company is still quite profitable, and whether it remains in Porsche/Piech
hands or others' is quite up to the families, as ever.

Subject: Help with 944 wiring
Message-Id: <13911020234831/0004056890NA2EM@mcimail.com>

Hiya,

I'm putting an oil temp sender and gauge into my 944S, and am in fact all done
except for a bit of wiring.  I want to give the gauge the same switched, fused
+12 used for the other console gauges (ever the compulsive engineer!).  This
comes from fuse 18 in the CES via a large black/red wire (1.5 mm).  According to
the wiring diagrams, this wire goes to a "welding point" number 10 (at schematic
location J19 in the '87 diagrams), from which come five wires which power
different existing gauges.  (This same welding point appears in all cars from
85/2 forward, by the way.)

I'll be danged if I can find this welding point.  It is rather hard to trace
wires because they're all bundled and wrapped.  I have found the wire coming
from the CES, but it disappears into the harness.

Does anyone know exactly what is meant by these non-ground "welding points"? 
Any clue as to how to find them?  I notice that, for example the brake pad wear
sensors come into the harness by a bunch of numbered welding points.  Thanks for
any help.

It's tire time in the big city. I've been extremely happy with the Yoko
AVS Intermediates  I've had on the 911 for the last year and a half, but
they're about shot. If not now, by the time I'm done with a driving school
at Texas World Speedway this weekend. (In case you're wondering, it's the
first Houston PCA event on a real track in many, many years. Rumor is that
the surface is really, really nice and the track is really fast. Event is
limited to some modest number of attendees, you have to be a PCA member
and proof may be required, and you have to pass tech. If you qualify
and want more info, let me know)

Anyway, the reasonable local Yoko place went under, and the Bridgestone
guy has taken over as being reasonable, so I'm lookin at RE71's. Can 
someone out there educate me as to the differences in the various compounds,
the expected wear, and all that jazz.  And, on the off chance that my tires
don't pass tech and I have to do something NOW, should I have the new tires
shaved before crawling up on a track, or am I going to be safe with regular
tires?

Subject: Need some advise - BFG


This is the first of three articles that I put in our region's
newsletter earlier this year.  

1991 Tire Update              Mike Rufkahr (Metro Region)

Reprinted from the Porsche Post.

Several manufacturers of high performance tires have announced recent
changes to their product lines for 1991, and some of those changes
should be of particular interest to Porsche owners, especially those
who drive their cars at the track or in autocross events.  This
article discusses changes in the BF Goodrich Comp T/A R1 series.
Future articles will address announcements by other manufacturers (next
month: Yokohama).  

BF Goodrich has replaced its 1990 road race series and autocross
series R1s with two new series of tires known as the 204 series (road)
and the 206 series (autocross) R1s.  The new series of tires retain
the asymmetric tread pattern of the old series, but feature
redesigned, asymmetric sidewall construction.  The inboard sidewalls
are stiffer than the outboard sidewalls, a setup which BFG claims
makes the tire more responsive to steer inputs without degrading the
ability of the tire to conform to the road surface during transition.

Several points about the new R1s merit special mention.  First, BFG
claims that the asymmetric sidewalls make the tires incompatible with
old R1s and, as a result, going to new series R1s is a four tire
transaction.  Second, the asymmetry also means that the stiffer
sidewall must always be mounted inboard (as indicated on the tire).
And third, although the new series road race R1 continues to be
Z-rated, the autocross R1 no longer carries a speed rating and should
not be used for racing or other sustained high speed driving.

Incompatibility raises an issue for those already shod with old R1s.
If tires on one axle wear out before those on the other, should you
trash the good pair and buy four new tires, or should you find some
old R1s to replace just the worn out pair?  Several factors will bear
on that decision.  First, you have to determine whether the new series
represents an improvement that justifies sacrificing any remaining
life in your old tires.  Second and third are the intertwined issues
of availability and price.  New series R1s seem to be readily
available at prices comparable to 1990 prices (16 inch prices range
from $135 to $145).  BFG is offering liquidation sale prices on old
series R1s, but not all sizes are available under that offer.  For
instance, in 16 inch sizes, BFG liquidation prices are available on
205s ($92) and 255s($98), but no 225s or 245s are available from BFG.

Many dealers, however, have 1990 versions of both 225s and 245s in
inventory.  A dealer can either order tires for you from BFG at the
liquidation prices, or sell you tires from their own inventory.  A
dealer can also have tires ordered from BFG drop shipped to another
address if you want someone else to mount them.

The tire brands discussed in this series of articles have been
selected on the basis of which brands seem to be most popular among
Metro NY Region PCA members for high performance applications, and the
availability of information from manufacturer representatives.
Neither the author, the Air Cooled Advertiser, nor the Metro or HCP
regions endorse any particular brand of tire.

Is this for PCA club racing?  I've done bolt-ins, but never full
frames.  A bunch of us have been thinking about entering the PCA club
curcuit, but I didn't think tube frames were a category.

This is the second.

1991 Tire Update              Mike Rufkahr (Metro Region)

Reprinted from the Porsche Post.

This article, the second in a series about 1991 performance tires,
discusses recent changes in the Yokohama 008 series.  The BF Goodrich
Comp T/A R1 series was profiled in the last issue, and future
installments will address announcements by other manufacturers.

Yokohama has recentely introduced the A008RS, its newest street legal
competition tire.  The 8RS replaces two Yokohama models, the A008R
and the A008RTU.  There is a good chance that you are familiar with
the 8R, basically a softer compound version of the well known A008.
The 8RTU was intended to replace the 8R, and did in many sizes last
year, but the replacement program was never completed.  Yokohama
explains that other manufacturers introduced so many new competition
products over the last year that Yokohama decided to introduce another
improved 008 version for 1991.

The new tire features stuffer sidewalls than its predecessors, while
offering a more compliant belt package for increased contact and a
more progressive (and a more forgiving) breakaway characteristic.
Toss in some compound improvement, and Yokohama claims the result is
an increase in both responsiveness and ability to handle lateral
acceleration forces (that is, more stick in corners).

The 8RS, like the tires it replaces (and like the BFG R1), comes out
of the mold with a tread block depth of 6/32 inch.  Yokohama claims
that for club use, 5/32 inch (which is achieved almost as soon as the
tire is scrubbed) offers the best balance of performance and tread
life.  Shaving to 3/32 inch is said to provide only a very small
increase in performance and thus is not justifiable at the club level.

The 8RS retains the asymmetric tread pattern and asymmetric square
sidewall design that distinctly set the appearance of the 008 series
apart from other brands.  The asymmetric tread and the sidewall require
that the 8RS always be mounted with the designated sidewall toward the
outside of the rim (as indicated on the tire).  Like its predecessors,
the 8RS will be available in both A and B construction for each size,
and will be marked with corresponding arrows on the sidewalls.  For
Porsches and all other rear-drive cars, the arrows on the front tires
should point OPPOSITE the direction of rotation, and the arrows on the
rear should point in the direction of rotation.  [Note: this is due to
the construction not to the tread - Ed.]  To understand why
requires a brief lesson in tire construction.

The final layer in bullding a tire is the tread rubber, which is
wrapped around a drum and spliced together with a buttjoint.  The
direction of this bevel determines whether the tire is A or B
construction.  The bevel causes the tire to pull itself together at
the seam when torque is applied in one direction, and to pull itself
apart at the seam when torque is applied in the other direction.  The
sidewall arrows indicate the direction of torque application which
will pull the tire together, and the objective is to have the tire
pull itself together when subjected to the most torque.  Applied
torque is opposite to the direction of rotation under braking, and for
driven wheels is with the direction of rotation under acceleration.
Since the front tires do most of the braking and the rear do all the
acceleration (in rear wheel drive cars), front tire arrows should
point opposite the direction of rotation, and rear tire arrows with
the direction of rotation.

The proper mounting convention seems to be breached nearly as often as
it is observed, but Yokohama is not overly concerned.  The company
says it has yet to see a separation problem casued by improper
mounting direction.  Nevertheless, they recommend that the
prescribed mounting procedure be followed for track events,
especially for the front tires.  Autocrossers apparently need not
lose any sleep over the issue.

Yokohama recommends that, for best results, someone already shod with
8Rs or 8RTUs who change to the 8RS make the switch at all four
corners, but a one step transition is not absolutely necessary.
Because the 8RS is similar to its predecessors, it is not incompatible
with them.  But if new models are mixed with old, the newer, stickier
tires should always be mounted on the rear for saftey, and tire
styles should never be mixed on a single axle.  

Perhaps the most dramatic change for the new 008RS is the reduction in
price.  Yokohama tires have carried premium price tags in the past
that have kept some potential buyers at a distance, but prices for the
8RS are very competative.  For 16" tires, one local retailer in New
Jersey and Connecticut expects prices will range from $130 for 205s
to $138 for 245s.  The future tense crept in there because, as this
article goes to press, 8RS tires are not yet generally available in
all sizes.  Yokohama says it is committed to Porsche owner needs, and
the most common Porsche sizes are slated for second quarter
availabillity.  Other sizes will become available over the summer.
In the meantime, liquidation prices are generally available on both
the 8Rs and the 8RTUs, with 16 inch prices advertised by some
retailers in the $110 to $125 range.

Keep in mind that both the Yokohama 8RS and the BFG R1 have been
developed with the objective of maximum performance in a street legal
competition tire, and compromises have been made to ride quality and
tread life in pursuit of that objective.  These compromises may be
worthwhile to someone who drives regularly at the track or in
autocross events.  They probably do not make sense for someone who
drives all (or substantially all) of the time on the street, where
there is little or no opportunity to realize the peformance advantages
of these tires but where all the compromises are acutely felt.

A tire to keep an eye out for is the A008P (P IS for Porsche),
specially designed by Yokohama to meet Porsche factory requirements
for ride quality, tread life, and wet weather capabilities.  The 8P
has not received a lot of attention since its introduction, but now
Porsche has selected the tire to be original equipment on the 1991
Turbos headed to the US and parts of Europe, and that is sure to give
the tire a higher profile.  In terms of performance, Yokohama slots
the 8P in between the street oriented intermediate line and the 8RS,
and calls the 8P the best choice for an aggressive street tire with
occasional track or autocross use.  If anyone out there has a 91 Turbo
they would be willing to loan me for a week or two of ``evaluation,''
I would be pleased to give them a full performance report on their
tires [ I could do it for you, too -Ed. ]

The tire brands discussed in this series of articles have been
selected on the basis of which brands seem to be most popular among
Metro NY Region PCA members for high performance applications, and the
availability of information from manufacturer representatives.
Neither the author, the Air Cooled Advertiser, nor the Metro or HCP
regions endorse any particular brand of tire.

Subject: Need some advise - Bridgestone


This is the third.

1991 Tire Update                       Mike Rufkahr (Metro Region)

Reprinted from the Porsche Post

This article, the third in a series focusing on 1991 changes to high
performance tire offerings, discusses recent revisions to Bridgestones
RE71R series.  Previous installments have convered the BF Goodrich Comp
T/A R1 and Yokohama A008RS series.

Bridgestone has replaced last year's RE71R with two new tires for 1991,
the RE71RZ and the RE71RAZ.  The RZ and RAZ share a new compound
formulation that Bridgestone claims represents an improvement in grip
significant enough to cause the company to recommend that neither model
be mixed with an old R series tire, neither across an axle nor front to
rear, to avoid substantially upsetting suspension balance.

The official explanation of the difference between the RZ and the RAZ is
that, although both series benefit from the compound change from the old
R model, the RZ retains the tread pattern of the R model, while the RAZ
incorporates a new tread design.  That explanation requires a little
elaboration, however, because you cannot see the difference between an
RZ and an RAZ fresh from the mold.  Indeed, the RZ and the RAZ carry
identical footprints - until the tires are worn or shaved to a depth of
4/32 of an inch.

The RE71 in all of its series has both circumferential and lateral (or
cross) grooves that give the footprint its distinctive shape.  On both
the old R and the new RZ, the depth of the circumferential and lateral
grooves is about the same, with the result that the tread pattern
remains unchanged until the tread blocks are completely worn away and
the tire becomes bald.  On the new RAZ, however, the lateral grooves
are not cut as deeply as the circumferential grooves.  In fact the
bottom of the lateral grooves is 4/32 inch higher than the bottom of the
circumferential grooves.  As a result, when an RAZ is worn (or shaved)
to a 4/32 inch tread block depth, the lateral grooves disappear, and
only four circumferential grooves remain, making the RAZ the street
legal tire which comes closest to the appearance of a racing slick.

Now that you understand the difference between the RZ and the 
raz, you might think that you have to decide which is right for you. 
Well, you don't.  All you need to know is your tire size, because in any
given tire size Bridgestone offers either the RA or the RAZ, but not
both.  RAZs dominate the RE71 line, but OEM specifications from auto
manufacturuers for certain sizes prevented Bridgestone from adopting the
RAZ's differing groove depth approach accross the board.  Presumably to
reduce both confusion and manufacturing costs, it was decided not to
offer the RAZ in those sizes for which the RZ format tires have to be
produced.  In 16" sizes, RZ is the flavor of 205/55 and 245/50 sizes,
while the RAZ covers 225/50, 245/45 and 255/50.

Note that the "Z" in RZ and RAZ is merely part of the model designation,
not a speed rating.  In fact, with the exception of the 16" 255/50, the
entire RE71R lineup is V-rated.  Bridgestone says that the series is
made from milds for which V rating certification was done secveral years
afgo, before the cerrent trend to Z ratings for high performance tires. 
The company claims that it has not fgelt any pressure to test to Z
rating standartds since a V rating certifies a ture to 149 mph.  A
Bridgestone representative adds that they just haven't seen a
significant need for tires certified at over 149 mph.  

Resisting teh coure towards asymmetry being charted by BFG and YOKO,
both the RZ and RAZ sport symmetrical tread and sidewall constructions. 
ANother difference is that, unlike the R1s and 008s, the RE71RZ and RAZ
emerge from the mold with a full 10/32 inch tread block dp.  Before you
can buy them, however, the tires are shaved to a maximum 7/32 inch
depth.  Bridgestone claims that while 7/32 inch is ideal for the wet,
maximum dry track performance begins around 4/32.  The difference
between and 6/32 inch lies principally in the ability of the tire to
dissipate heat, not tread block squirm, and so autocrossers, who
generally are not affected by a tires ability to handle heat, will
attain peak performance as early as 6/32 inch.

Last month's installment described Yoko's approach to the sidewall
arrows on their tires.  Recall that on 008s the arrows should point in
the direction of greatest applied torque, which is with the direction of
rotation in the rear and against it in the front.  For RE71s, however,
the arrow should always point in the direction of rotation because
optimal water dispersion is the sole factor in determining which way an
RE71 should roll.  Once an RAZ has been worn to 4/32 inch and the
lateral grooves disappeared, the direction of rotation is no longer
dictated by the tread design, but assuming it has already been run
aggressively in one direction, reversing the direction will necessitate
breaking the tire in again before maximum performance can be realized in
the opposite direction.

Prices for RE71R tires have always been very competative, and that
continues in 1991.  Prices for the 16-inch sizes range from $125 to
$135, and they are currently available.

Nope. It's to position ourselves for a GT2 effort. One of the guys
just passed his SCCA Pro license over the weekend. I'm really too
big to be seriously competitive at that level (too many ponies just
to drag my carcass around the track, you know...) but do most of the
tech stuff, and after participating in a short-lived GT1 effort this 
year, want more.

It also should be seriously kick-ass in some of the prepared/modified
Solo and PCA autoX classes, with the right engine, etc.

Hi - this morning I test-drove a '73-1/2 911T (2.4L, CIS, totally rust-
free, factory sunroof, cam tensioner fix, very clean) that the owner
wants to sell for $9000.  It drives and looks nice.

My Porsche mechanic is selling it for the owner, and he (the mechanic)
says it's in great shape.  I'm inclined to believe him.

Does this sounds like a good buy?  What should I look for?

If I'm interested, I'll be selling my '69 912 (95k miles, 20k on 1650cc 
kit, new suspension/torsion bushings, very clean, minimal rust, fuchs
wheels, well cared for).  Inquiries welcome (contingent on my buying the
911T).

Still doing my 911 research ...

This is the 2nd example I've seen of a '73-1/2 911T.  But the stuff that
I've read so far makes no mention of a mid-year change for the 911 ...
what's special about a '73-1/2?

Subject: seeking 914 2.0  --> 914-6 advice


Hello world -

I have recently become the owner of a 1974 2.0 liter 914.  The engine
is curently in bits in the basement.  ( I bought the car as *un drivable*
but drove it home anyway :-)  The battery shelf has the traditional
problems... Things that I would like to do are as follows.

Rebuild the 2.0 as reliable as possible, and then in a few years
when I become rich I want to start building a 6 cylinder and put
it in..

Replace the front suspensiuon with the 911 front end.  I will
probably be getting my brothers old 911 front suspension.  I also
would like to change to the factory forged alloys that were used on
the 911/914-6 (i think)

I am intersted in saftey upgrades... My brother put in a roll bar 
plus kidney bars (not scca aproved) into his 911.  The ease of
getting in and out seems to suffer a little but you get used to
it pretty fast and I wont be letting very many people drive my
car anyway.

Questions.  where can I find a reasonable souce of parts/information?
what is the net wisdom about the *upgrades*?  I hope to be using the
car for daily driving (when not driving my motorcycle).  I would like
to become more proficient at high performance driving i.e  joining pca
(how does one do this?) and looking into the local auto cross scene
not really to be competative, but to learn to drive better.

Any information would be great.


thanks

Stuart -

Congrats on your new car!  To join the PCA, get in touch with our national
membership chair: Nann Weissenberger at 617 631 4157 (home number, EST).  If I
knew where you lived, I could put you in touch with someone closer to home. 
Nann will do this.

By all means join the club; it is the best first step to more advice on how to
set up your car than you will ever use!  There are a ton of companies which
advertise in our national monthly, Panorama, who have what you need to improve
the 914.  You should also check our European Car (until recently titled
VW/Porsche Magazine), which has historically given the 914's plenty of
attention.  They recently had a special issue devoted to the model - ask them
for the back issue.

The 914 -> 914/6 conversion has been a popular one.  PCA reprints all technical
articles as a series called "Up-Fixin der Porsche."  You can by these dandy
little volumes from our national office.  I know I have seen articles in them
which call out the exact parts list for a conversion, complete or incremental. 
Beyond the original stock 914/6, there are any number of other, newer 911
components which can be retrofitted for even more fun.

I believe there were two important changes:

  - replacement of the mechanical fuel injection system with a continuous
    fuel injection system (CIS), and
  - bumped displacement from 2.4 to 2.7 litres.

But I drive a water-cooler.  What do I know...

Kevin


nowing what you're getting.  Better for both you and the seller, imho.

You might also try to enlist a local PCA'er who is expert in cars of that
vintage.  Such a person is probably the best to ask, not what's wrong with the
car, but what sort of things you can look forward to fixing up and enhancing.

Hope this helps.  Good luck!

Kevin

  Did the 73.5 911T have a 2.7 yet?  I think it might be a 2.4 with CIS...

Anyhow, probable gotcha's for that era that I ran into with my car is, of
course, the front suspension pan - make sure it is not rusted.  If it has
been repaired, make sure it isn't a Tweeks garbage-can-scrap replacement
panel.  Mine was repaired shortly before I bought the car, and within a year
the front A-arm bracket literally ripped itself out of the panel.  Oh well...
Other things I ran into were worn out suspension bushings all around, worn
out shocks all around, and a really crappy valve adjustment.  My suggestion
it to take it in and get the valves adjusted first thing - who knows how long
it has been.

I got my '73 911S (no sunroof...sigh) for 9k, 20K on well rebuilt engine,
but the interior is hosed.  Got to have something to keep me occupied on
weekends.

The best source of info is probably here on this list. The next best
is "out there" where people are really driving. Join the PCA, the SCCA, 
and the 914 Owners Association. NOW. Read a lot. Go to events, even if
you're not  driving. Ask questions. Learn.

And most importantly, enjoy.

Look, if you want Instant Gratification, call the national office *directly*
at 703.922.9300 (yup, did that from memory I did...), tell them you want
to join, and have your VIN number and VISA number ready (hmmmm. wonder if
I could just charge that to my VIN number next time...Naaaa....)

I just walked three people through this in the last few days getting
ready for a driving school. It works. Really.

Subject: PAP, the never-ending story...


As you may recall, I have an on-going problem with P.A.P.  Just in case
you are considering doing business with them, DO NOT!  Here's an update:

March, 1991: I ordered a set of valve springs.  I was sent used, dirty
rusty springs that no reputable dealer would even consider selling, and
no sane Porsche owner would consider installing.  I returned the springs
and asked for a VISA credit.  I spoke to the salesman, Dave, who told me 
I had ordered used valve springs.  I replied that I had been working on
Porsche engines since 1970, and that I had never reused valve springs -
let alone rusty springs.  I asked him if he knew what surface rust would
do to a valve spring.  He didn't reply.  He did say that I would receive
a credit.

June, 1991.  No VISA credit appeared in April or May.  I spoke to the
office mgr., and asked for an explanation.  She said that the salesman
was not authorized to make credits - only she was.  Said she would do
it.

September and October, 1991.  Still no credit on VISA.  I called VISA, and 
asked how to make a claim.  I was told that no claim can be accepted after 60 
days from the date of purchase.  I called PAP, and asked to speak to the 
office mgr.  Three calls on three different days, netted the same reponsed: I 
was told that the mgr. is at lunch, but that she will return my call.  When 
I asked to speak to the boss, I was told that he was on the phone (probably 
talking to another ripped-off customer).  When I volunteered to wait (on 
hold), I was told that they cannot allow me to do that - he will return the 
call.

I am still waiting.

I know that some of you have spoken favorably about PAP in the past.  If
you have anything to add, please post it.  If you still have contacts
inside, please find out what is going on.

BTW, did you notice PAP's ad in a recent Pano that implied that they
had been in poor financial health, but that their business had improved?  I
wonder if the "improvement" is the result of scams like this one?

Subject: Re: '73-1/2 911T K

Regarding the difference between the '73 and '73.5 T, the late '73 had 
CIS injection instead of mechanical injection, but they still had the
same displacement. Only the Carrera RSs had 2.7 liters, which was a precursor
to that same displacement on all '74 models.

Personally, I think the late '73 T's are great cars. They are the last 
year for the earlies before the '74 crash bumpers appeared, and IMHO are
much more pleasing and pure aesthetically. I bought a '71 E for this reason
a couple of years ago because I liked the purity of the pre-'74 design.
My car had mechanical fuel injection and it always ran rich. As a matter
of fact, it was a filthy running car. I know there are a couple of schools
of thought regarding mechanical injection. A lot of people swear by them, 
and I know others who swear at them. Apparently, they're great when they're
working properly and closest to what Porsche was doing with their racing
cars of the time, but they can also be rotten when they aren't working 
so well.

I think late '73 T's are a great investment item. They appeal to people like
me who are looking for the original body design, but want the updated
injection system. CIS, by the way, was used across the line in '74.

I recently had a chance to drive a late '73 T. A friend at work was looking
to buy his first 911 and asked me to come along to check it out. After driving
it, I was very frustrated that I couldn't buy it. (I had purchased a '76
912E as an interim car a few months prior.) The T was a yellow, rust-free
coupe with 65,000 original miles and very well maintained. The owner wanted
$9900 and I felt it was worth every penny of that. On the road, the car
felt every bit as strong as my '71 E. As a matter of fact, it felt stronger
and more tractable in the lower rev ranges.

As for me, I'll probably keep the 912 for an undetermined period of time,
then either look for a late '73 T or a '78 or newer SC.

'74 914 2.0

The scenario last night:

I'm accelerating from a stoplight and I hear a loud BANG and then
clunking and scraping periodic with the wheel rotation.  I pull over
and push the car into an empty parking lot.  I search for the problem
and eventually discover that grabbing the outer end of the rightmost
drive shaft and wiggling it around yields a lot more wiggling than it
should.  I have the car towed home, rear wheels off the ground.

So what happened?

I assume the CV joint bolts fell out or sheared off (or some of each)
and the shaft is now free at the outer end.  If so, what will likely
need to be replaced?  More than just the joint and bolts?  Any other
probable explanations?

During the next week I was about to order a bunch of parts and tools
from Automobile Atlanta, including the 12-point CV joint tool.  Any
hints where I might be able to get one by Saturday?  Any hints about
easy ways to get at the outer CV joint?  Do I need to remove the
control arm?

Thanks!

  You can get the CV joint tool at any VW/bug type place - that's where I got
mine.  Welcome to the world of sheared CV joint bolts - I did it 3 or 4 times
on my 914.  My suggestion is to use some heavy duty loktite on the bolts...
but be careful not to overtighten them.  You can put too much stress on them
and instead of backing out, they will just shear off leaving you with a fun-
filled afternoon of bolt extraction.

  The same thing happened to my 911 a couple of times - turned out to be a bent
driveshaft.  I went ahead and replaced it rather then be stranded again with
sheared bolts.  Besides, 911 CV joints are a bit more expensive than 914 CV
joints...

Stan -

Good point!  You can of course pony up and join right away.  My mindset is that
people generally would like to se a bit of what their $36.00 is going to get
them before parting with it.  Calling Nann will get you sample issues of both
Pano and your region's newsletter.

Thanks for the correction.

a reasonable asking price is?  
	The car is an 1986 with 88K miles on it.  Clutch, timing belt,

It is a gold color with grey/tan leather, Alpine CD w/ADS sound sytem, and

Date: Fri, 25 Oct 91 17:19:29 PDT
From: desousa@cisco.com

Glad to hear you got some answers on that router stuff.

Suspension:
	If the factory went to a smaller bar in the rear it is probably
for the same reason that you experienced with the bigger anti-sway bar.
The general rule is that a bigger bar in the rear causes more oversteer.
This is especially popular to do with autocross cars but for Solo I racing
it gets scary.(as you have witnessed)  
	The best way to go is with adjustable sway bars.  I have been out
of the business for a while but a place called Suspension Techniques used
to sell some very high quality adjustable bars.  They weren't much more
expensive than standard bars.  The only negative was that they provided less
ground clearance but on 951's that is probably not an issue.  
For the first couple of years of trying to make my car handle correctly I 
waisted a lot of money on different shocks, bars, and tires.  I finally
woke up to the fact that ajustability was not only the answer but it was
a better economic decision.  
	Also be aware that front shocks usually weaken before rear shocks
and therefore are probably contributing to the oversteer condition.  They 
may not necessarily be failing already its just that they are subject to 
the weight and heat of the engine, and the overall weight transfer when 
braking.  Different shock wear rate is normal and can usually be compensated
for through suspension tuning.(ie..weight balancing, bar adjusting etc..)
	As for the question of being good and not running the chip...
I would probably wait until warranty is over.  Driving fast is hard and
even though it may be frustrating to run up against the "chip'd" cars, at
least yours will probably be racing longer so you get more practice.
	I totally agree about the gatorbacks, what little experience
 I had with them, I prefer the tire that gives the most warning when
it is going to slip.  I favor the feedback from more forgiving tires
because I learn how to be a better driver faster instead of spiinning
and then trying to recall how you lost it in the first place.

Gotta go, happy motoring.  It is finally raining here in Silicon Valley,
got to be carefull when the boost kicks in...

yes there was some good discussion between your guys and mine.  thanks
for forwarding the message.

now if only my routers would show.. or at least my portland rep would return
a phone call once in a while..

good luck re the 951 upgrade.  sorry i haven't kept track of pricing -
i find it too depressing, actually.  i recall california cars being
labelled so and possibly fetching a higher price back east than a regular
east coast mobile.

there's a used porsche newsletter that i wish i could recall a name for.
my old dealer subscribed - schneider-nelson p-a (908) 389-1000.  it had
tons of porsches of all kinds complete with prices and pretty long-winded
descriptions.

btw i just bought an 18mm rear bar.  i may have mentioned that was original
equipment on 951S except they switched to 16mm in mid-year.  well, the 20mm
bar i got last year might be a *tad* too stiff - i spun twice at pir two
weeks ago, quite suddenly and irrevokably, not a good feeling.  could be
the suspension, could be the non-sticky and unforgiving gatorbacks, could
be i'm out of practice, could be i'm just trying too hard what with no chips,
ordinary tires, etc.

all i know is i'm doing a serious re-think of my priorities.  sure i want
a level playing field where nobody hops up their car, and i don't want to
abuse my warranty.  but jeez mon sheetmetal is damned expensive and maybe
i went too far with this principles thing..  if everyone else is going to
run with chips and sticky tires i probably shouldn't fight it.

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL10]


Hi all

Just a brief note regarding turbo tie-rod upgrade.  I have been bothered
by steering jitter in my '80 911SC ever since I have owned it.  I finally
decided something needed to be done.  This problem has been very road
surface dependent, O.K. on smooth blacktop, but sometimes quite bad on the
concrete highways with regular expansion joints which we have hereabouts.
(And horrendous on the completely broken up concrete highways like CA 99).

I eliminated wheel balance (which I would usually suspect) because of the
strong surface dependency.  On Saturday, crusing down to AJR for an oil
filter, I decided to try a fix I had been toying with in my mind for quite
a while, hence the subject.  The short story is:  dramatic improvement.

If anyone is having similar problems I would sure recommend this fix for
not too much bucks ($128.00), or time (2-3 hours).  The overall steering is
quite improved as well and I can now see why this is such a popular upgrade.
It is also easy to see why the old tie-rods that have a sort of rubber
universal joint could allow quite alot of vibration to develop, especially 
as aging allows greater flex.

The only gotchas are that you need a toe-in after you're done (I did mine
temporarily by measurement and it seems fine but I'll probably spring for
the real thing), and that the new tie rod is supposed to be attached to the
rack with 150 n/m of torque and there is no way to get any wrench I could 
find onto the square head of the thing (it is about 30 something mm across
the flats and buried up in a canyon of the body where the steering rack 
goes).  How one would actually torque this in any case I have no idea
(actually a huge crow-foot might do it I guess).  I ended up carefully 
applying exactly 150 n/m of twist with a medium size pair of water pump 
pliers :-).  This got it good and tight and I think it will be just fine.  
Not really a critical torque in any sense I could see and I'm pretty paranoid
about such things.  

Didn't end up very brief, I guess...

Subject: 944 windshield

Hello.  I had a great day at Lime Rock on October 25, except for 1 thing.  The
windshield on my 944 cracked.  I am SURE that nothing hit the car -- It must
have been due to stress caused by cornering.

Has anyone seen this sort of thing before? My car is on warranty still, so
I'd certainly like to get this fixed without cost. Any comments?

PS: George, I got your message. Yep, you were bouncing all around in the
diving turn. You better look into shock mods. (On the other hand, if you
leave it as is, I may be able to keep ahead of you.)


PPS:  This is interesting.  A guy with Weltmeister bars on the rear of his 911
had a mounting bracket break off.  The front wheels lifted into the air at
least 6 inches in each turn.  It was quite a sight.

Regarding torquing a tie rod into the steering rack, I did this a few years ago
by buying the necessary 32 mm. wrench and a fish weigher.  I  measured the
wrench to figure the needed force at its length, and applied that much force via
the weigher.  I needed the new tie rod, and figured putting it in myself this
way would save the cost of a flat-bed to my car's ultimate destination.  The
torque spec for a 944-series car is 85 Nm/61 ftlb., which worked out to 50 lb.
at the 13" length, if memory serves.

I have never seen a 32 mm crow-foot, and did ask my local Snap-On guy about it
at the time.  Porsche does have such a tool for sale, but it does not fit a
standard ratchet drive.  It goes with a Stahlwille or Hazet (so I read) torque
wrench.

One thing I left to the shop was peening the tie rod into the rack.  This is
pretty important, since it locks it in!  The chap who did this for me ended up
grinding a chisel down to the right shape for the job.

The 32 mm. wrench is now featured in the novelty section of my toolbox.

Sounds like John Kiger from Jersey Shore Region (black, 1984 Carrera).
He jury-rigged it later in the weekend. Actually, it is relatively common
to see 911's with an inside front wheel well in the air (a few inches),
but 6 inches is rare. He still had his stiff front anti-sway bar, which
lifts the wheel when the car leans due to the relatively lower rear roll
stiffness.

Actually, this brings up an interesting question. Classic car setup theory
(Fred Puhn, as well as others, I believe) claim that if the car lifts a
wheel, that end of the car is simply too stiff in roll, but virtually all of
the fast 911s do it, so I'm sure there isn't a better setup which doesn't
lift the wheel. Can anybody correlate the theory with reality?

i've seen that picture/caption in fred puhn's book too.  he was rather
specifically pointing out the 911.  certainly it's true that once a
wheel has been lifted, you have 100% weight transfer and you aren't
going to get any more.

however, loosening the front is clearly not what these 911 people want -
they may have families, after all.

the answer probably breaks the rules for a given series, namely putting
*even* bigger tires on the back or moving *even* more of the car's mass
up front.

after all i don't recall any pictures of 935s lifting an inside front wheel..

	It is interesting to observe that there are other cars that follow
the same pattern of wheel lift.  The fastest VW Rabbits and Scirroco's had 
rear wheel lift, so observe the common denominator.  The type of vehicle that
has engine/transaxle positioned other than in the mid section seems to follow
the pattern.  Theories about that end of the car being to stiff might not
apply for front or rear weight biased cars.  Imagine picking up a rectangular
sheet of semi-rigid paper with a weight on one end by lifting on one of the 
corners... the light end has to be lifted higher to compensate for the weight
at the opposite end.   
	Porsche 935's compensated for this by several mods 
beyond the street legal 911's.  One way was the rear being raised higher than
the front.  Correct me if I am wrong but this was done for aerodynamics as
well as weight transfer?(911's shaped like an airfoil tended to lift past
150 MPH)

Subject: 944 windshield + 911 handling


In the Ruf video, "Yellowbird inthe Green Hell" which features (I
forget his name) driving the yellowbird at the Nurburg Ring, this guy
drives that car about as hard as you can possbily drive a 911, and he
doesn't lift wheels, so the Ruf setup must be exactly what people
would want.  I knwo I am lifting the inside front in the second apex
at Bigbend and the left hander, so when I finally get my real car back
on the track I'll be playing with roll stiffness.

Incidently, that is a simply awesome video.  The driver is putting the
RUF sideways in just about every turn, yet keeping under complete
control.  I wouldn't exactly call it SMOOTH, but what control, it's
incredible.  Also, someone, and I forget who, told me once that this
same driver wasn't actually that fst because he was scrubbing off so
much speed by putting the car sideways - well, I just found out he
holds the track record at the Nurburg Ring for street-legal cars, so
scratch that theory (and that includes people in F40s).  Maybe he
doesn't use the brakes that much.

Folks -

PCNA is once again selling off a whole bunch of new wheels for cheap.  The list
is too long for me to type in, but covers cookie cutters, telephone dials,
five-spokes, and flat disc styles for 944, 911, and 928 series cars.

If you're interested, you can either:

  - send mail to me asking about your application, or
  - call Mack Mackenzie at Clair Parts Express 1-800-354-5100.

Or you could patronize your local dealer, of course.  The last day they're
accepting orders is Oct 31st - act fast!

While I am cleaning out the garage for the winter, I figure its time
to get rid of some old 911 stuff. I have the complete parts book
and workshop manual for the 911s up to the SC models (to 1983)...
excellent condition. I think I paid $250 for the set, way back when...
yours for only $100!

If someone is on the Porsche List, could you please post this there 
too?

Chris,

The driver's name is, if memory serves, Stefan Roser.  He drove another Ruf car
at Brainard a few years back, and destroyed its tires in four laps.  You can't
be fast if you're in the pits all the time!  I think it's a very showy video and
Stefan is obviously a heck of a driver, but I don't think pitching the car the
way he did is the fast line.  I'm sure that if he set a touring record at the
'Ring his approach was a bit more conventional.

The really amazing thing about that video came towards the end.  Remember he was
flat out on the fastest portion of the track (north->south leg), only slowly
pulling in - yikes - some organ donor on a motorcycle!  That anyone would dare
drive a motorcycle that fast is quite bizarre.

Someone asked a few weeks ago what was meant by the circled 'E' followed by a
number.  I have the answer.  Apparently there is something called the European
Economic Commission which, like the US' ANSI and SAE, issues guidelines
regulating various equipment used in cars.  This includes things like lights,
signals, and tires.

The "mark of approval" is an E followed by a digit, in a circle.  The digit
indicates the "approving authority," with 1 denoting Germany.  This is followed
by a release number, eg,

   (E4) 020 427

Did you think at all before you wrote this?  Isn't it more than a bit
hypocritical?  Here we are, talking about Porsches and racing, yet you think
that someone else, racing a high-performance vehicle, is an "organ donor"
and displaying "bizare" behavior?  Have you any idea how many people think
that racing cars is dangerous and improper behavior?

I thought that we were all fairly rational adults here, capable of not only
deciding what risks we choose to accept, but also allowing others to make
that same choice.  I was wrong.

I can see why a serious motorcyclist might be upset about such a statement,
but I think that in this case it may be a mis-interpretation. While I am
relatively unfazed by the notion of going 140mph in my Rx7, doing the same
on a bike leaves my knees weak, my heart pounding, and brain in sensory
overload: on a bike, you are OUT THERE, and it takes a whole different level
of courage and skill to go that fast and do it well. Calling it "bizarre" is,
perhaps, inappropriate, in that it might have negative connotations, but
from where I sit that rider gets complete respect. Bikes have considerably
more performance potential than cages until the curvies really start to curve,
at least up to 160 or more (unless you're driving an F40 or something, where
it gets more even on the straights) so it's not such a surprise that a skilled
and confident bike racer can do very well compared to a Ruf. The surprise is
in discovering that such confidence and skill is not as uncommon as one might
have thought...

 I've got to agree with Ken here.. I'm one of those "organ donors"
 Kevin and I don't appreciate the sentiment or the label. Motorsports
 are underrepresented and underappreciated in this country and in
 dire straits. I, as a motorcycle racer, don't appreciate being stabbed
 in the back by a car racer/enthusiast.

 I hope you take the time to re-think your position.

 Stefan
