Subject: the lowly wheel bearing

Need some net wisdom:
I am prepping my 89 951 track car for next years season. 
I have heard from some "experts" that wheel bearings, specifically on the
front, should be replaced as routine maintenance. I am not sure I agree since
I have never had a bearing fail. I do routinely inspect the outers and they
get re packed on a regular basis. The rollers and the races look fine with no
scoring or galling, and of course they are carefully adjusted before each
event.
Do these items just fail? I have no problem replacing them since the expense
is not great. It just seems like an inspection and re packing with new seals
is sufficient.
Any input?

Jerry

I'm always in favor of using the C/M filter, but there are mounting issues
and you MUST have the high-volume pump. If you have a Pegasus catalog,
they have these guys. It's a billet aluminium canister with a top,
that takes a 4" cartridge. It filters to about 6 microns, and flows
something like 200 gal/hour with almost no restriction. Some current
car mag has a filter review and I can't find it off hand -- European
Car, Grass Roots Motorsport, Stock Car Racing are the likely suspects,
in that order.

I had a cam that wasn't hardened last summer. It wore the lobes from
0.420" to flat in about 3 hours of operation, taking the lifters with
it while it went. Total metal loose in the system was about 210 grams.
Almost all of it (except the sub-6 micron stuff) was trapped by the
filter. The BEARINGS looked like new! I tossed the bearings, spent
a hell of a long time cleaning oil lines and coolers and stuff, but did
not have to replace anything else. And the only reason the bearings
got replaced was that's just how I do things. Joe salvaged them and 
used them in another engine that's still running....

Plus, you can get them with an extra fitting for adding an Accusump
later if you need it. Greatly simplifies the plumbing.

To add it to your car, use a spin-on adapter, and use lines to relocate
the filter to someplace else. This is also a good time to add an oil
cooler, since you'll have the lines and oil already "out there".
Cost is about $90 for the filter and whatever the plumbing costs. 
Replacement cartridges are about $8 each.

There's not much on the hydraulic lifters story. Back in '90 I was
pretty  much in favor of it. Experience since has indicated that
it's not the best option. I'd recommend using FAT Performance for
*EVERYTHING* since they really know Type IVs. You'll also need a 
VW factory manual (i.e. a Robert Bently book) for the late Type IIs
that really used Type IV engines with hydraulic lifters to get the
right info on setting up the valve train. Of course, I've got my
engineering notes from the various times I've done this, but those
aren't on-line (or in print - yet).

So far, the 96mm kits are OK. They're NOT going to go much beyond 100K 
miles, but that's consistent with what the 356 guys have seen for 20
years with the late, lamented, NLA NPR big bore kits. Of course, better
oiling and oil cooling is necessary to make that life. And you can do
other things ("chose one from each column: "Bad Idea", "Stuipd Idea", 
"Hey, Don't Do This"....) that make the engine fail too. Bigger than that
takes case and head surgery, and if you add stroker cranks, you also get
to re-engineer the whole engine geometry...

Well, at least you're interested in learning! It's really easy to get into
trouble out there just listening to the buzz... After all, everyone's an
expert -- why, they took a test in Car and Driver that said so!

Subject: Porsche/Audi/VW part number equivalency ?



	Has anyone had any experience with the same part with a Porsche 
package being more expensive than, say, the same part with a VW package? 
I am not saying I have but I do suspect this.  I now own a 924 and
understand that many many parts came out of the VW factory parts bin, 
i.e. S-beatle front struts and brakes, Thing swing axel, and many misc
elec-items etc.  Has anyone tried to build an equivalency table? Do any such
tables exist (VW and Porsche dealerships here definitely don't have them)?  
Are there any good references to what parts will work as good or better? 

	Here, in Sweden, Porsche parts are incredibly expensive (probably
as elsewhere).  I would like to find some way to "beat the system" at
least once in a while.

	[Email to the list is probably better than to me directly...  ;> ]

cheers,
Kristian

PS Does anyone know of a mailorder company (possibly in the US) that has
a good detailed catalogue for the 924 with part numbers, etc, i.e. factory 
manual reprints with prices?  thanks :-)

Do not buy this car. The 3.2 Carrera should last engine 200,000+ miles with normal 
maintenance. This car has probably been abused and the previous owner does 
not deserve to have had a Porsche in that case. If you are willing to spend
$23,000 on a 911, just wait around a little longer and you will get something
much, much better, that will last many years given proper care. You *could*
take the risk, but it is not worth it IMHO.

Perhaps we should have a thread "I bought a Porsche Lemon", where people
confess to having made an unwise Porsche purchase. OK `fess up guys,
who has done this, and how many would do it again?

wow you have good luck with your wheel bearings. I've had to replace both

season) and the fronts routinely get repacked every season. Not much fun
when they fail-> *HORRIBLE* growling noises, usually start only in right corner
s. Then they get REAL loud and start slowing you down.

I will just be replacing them every spring when we put fresh rotors on.

This begs the question,  if you down-rate the speed rating on new tires 
aren't you asking for trouble from the INS co. if you do happen to have an

Subject:       buying a 911

Hi all.  I am planning to buy a Porsche or possibly a BMW.
On Sunday, as I was driving along I noticed a fellow with
2 Porsche 911's in his driveway.  Both are 1975 Silver
Anniversary models.  One for his wife and one for him.
His car has been rebodied with an '88 body with the fender
flairs and tail, as well as the engine has been replaced with
a 3.0 litre. (has about 10,000 miles since rebuild).  The
body looks really good.  
In the course of our conversation, he sounded like he would
sell the car, as he is looking for another project car.
What sort of things should I look out for?
He indicated that he would let the car go for about $25,000.
He is planning on replacing the shocks next week but I'm
not sure if that would include new rear tires or not.
Any comments appreciated.  I know very little about these
cars.
Thanks in advance.  Ed

Hi, Bob.
 
Trond means a grease gun. The best I've found is made by Lincoln. The
regular Plews brand carried by the trashy auto parts warehouse club things
are borderline useless and frustrating.
 
I had no trouble getting my pistons out, but to my knowledge they weren't
stuck either. I split the calipers, used bleeder screws to seal unwanted
openings (like the ones for the balance pipe between caliper halves) and
just stuck the air nozzle in one hole. I held the caliper half
open-side-down on a wooden board, I think with a piece of 2x4 or something
to help in the alignment. Pistons popped right out with shop air, hit the
wood, stopped.

Subject: Coolant Survey for waterpumpers

OK. Net wisdom says.

Factory approved coolants:
VW/Audi "Autobahn"
Mercedes Benz "Mercedes Benz"
Zerex "Extreme 450"
SAAB "Something"

Probably usable:
Prestone "LongLife"
Prestone "Something"

Who knows:
Sierra "Won't kill the neighborhood pets if you dispose of it illegally"

Caveats: If you use something other than the brands listed above, you still 
definitely must use phosphate-free coolants. If the label says OK for 
aluminum engines, it may possibly be usable. Focus on the ingredient label 
and scan for the word "phosphate." If it is not there, you may have a 
winner. Using something with phosphate will increase your potential for 
internal corrosion and blockage leading to $$$ water pump replacement. 
Least you feel that $150 for a rebuilt water pump is small change compare 
to say 951 spark plug wires, find out how much labor is involved in the 
water pump swap, versus simply putting in the right coolant.

I have been wondering why there is no such thing as a coolant filter on a 
car.

Porsche had a recall on 951's for leaking fuel lines in the engine
compartment in about 3Q91.  You might want to verify that your car had
this recall done.  Any Porsche dealer should be able to look up your VIN
number and verify this.

If you bought your car used and never sent in the card in your owner's
manual (or service manual, I don't remember which) it makes it difficult
for Porsche to contact you and let you know of any recall campaigns.  I
bought my 87 951 in August of 91 and sent in the card.  Within 2 weeks I
received a letter from PCNA and a phone call from the dealer about
performing the recall.

I think when these show up, you will find a set of Sach's or Boge shocks

911's came with either Boge (black), Koni (red), or Bilstein (green) struts.

All,

     Thanks  for  the  suggestions  on  removal  of  the  caliper
pistons.   Last  night I re-attached the caliper to the car,  and
pumped  out a piston using the brake pedal.  It took very  little
pressure, and about 3 strokes.  The piston cleaned up nicely, and
is  re-  installed.  I could easily have completed both  pistons,
but  for  the trick-or-treaters.  I guess it's a good idea to  do
one  wheel  at a time, rather than removing everything  from  all
four, just in case you need to use this technique.

     Now, if I can just find a wheel bearing puller, which I will
only need once in my life, for less than $150.

	Does anybody have a Phone number for Koni ? I have a front strut
which is beginning to develop some lateral slop at the top. Result is
a sort of variable camber front suspension. It also is making an unnerving

Yermo,
$23.9k for a fairly high mileage 87 is just an okay price, not great.
Hack a couple of thousand off it and you're looking at a decent deal.

However, I would be very careful to fully explore this engine work
and odometer thing.  A 3.2 Carrera should not need engine work at
89k unless it was abused.  (This is defintely *not* the case with
the late 70's 2.7's.)  Conventional wisdom says Carreras, like SC's,
should last a couple hundred thousand miles if they're taken care of.
My 88 had 120k on it when I sold it and never showed any signs of
weakness.  And I know of others with similar experiences on much
higher mileage Carreras.

Major service is typically 15k, but this can be stretched a little
without harm as long as oil and filter were changed regularly and
obvious "tips" were not ignored (the need for valve adjustment is
often evident, for instance).  Lots of expensive parts were replaced;
parts that shouldn't need replacing.  I'm suspicious.  Something
probably happened to this engine.  The owner wasn't just anal.

A good rebuild isn't a scary thing, though.  Do you know who did the
work?  Can you talk to the shop about the job?  If it was fixed right
there should be nothing to worry about.  It's an issue to be dealt
with again when you later sell the car.  Maybe you can use that as
leverage with the dealer when you negotiate price.

Autothority is famous for their performance chips.  I don't know
anything about their shop but they're probably very familiar with
Porsches so I'd guess they can do a decent inspection.  Have them
do a leakdown test (not just a compression test).  If there are
problems this can sometimes tell you *where* by the sound and
location of the escaping air.

Good luck!

Subject: Re: 356 brake pistons

It seems that everyone has been telling stories about how to pop out pistons
from brake calipers.  Well, have I got a story!

I had a BMW 2000CS with a sticking front caliper so I decided (I was 17) that it
needed a fixin' up'd.  So, I took off the caliper and tried to get the pistons
unstuck from the caliper.  No luck.  I banged on them.  I twisted them but they
wouldn't come out.  I then saw my dad's air compressor and I figured that 150
psi into the brake line input with both of the bleeder screws closed ought to
do the trick.  LOUD hissing sounds followed.  But it was moving!!!!!  Slowly.
I realized that, yes, one was moving but the other was not and if I didn't do
something quick it was going to pop out and I wasn't EVER going to get the stuck
one out.  So I grabbed the piston with the tips of my fingers.......

		BOOM!!!!!!

The piston popped out against the tips of my fingers.  I screamed.  It
hurt.  It hurt alot.  I can't think of anything that hurt more.  Within two days
I had black fingernails on three of my fingers.
The piston wasn't damaged, though; my fingers softened the impact.

My dad did the same thing but instead of the piston bouncing off his fingers 
and onto the floor, it popped out against his fingers and STAYED there!!!!!
I would've payed BIG money to see dear ol' dad running around with a brake
caliper/snapping turtle on the end of his fingers!

In the last couple of 3.2-into-early-car conversions I've been involved
with, we ran through a BUNCH of moderately low mile 3.2s that all checked
with low compression on #2 and #4, and that had leakdown problems on the
same cylinders. These are like 40-50k mile engines, and should have been
OK even if abused based on what I've seen with 3.0s. No clue as to why,
couldn't get anyone to spend the $$ to have them split and checked...

Ed: Sounds like you're looking for dependable German iron to drive regularly.  
Opinion is structured on this assumption.  So IMHO here you go: 
 
 Firstly, buy a Porsche 911.  Better value, higher resale, higher "inch" 
factor (inches perceived added to one's major organ), and more fun than all 
but the most exotic, rare, and expensive Big Mean Wagon . 
 
Secondly, generally accepted rule is buy a 78  or newer. 78-83's are "SC"'s, 
84 thru 89's are called "Carrera".  These cars are very dependable, very 
durable. Generally, buy the newest, lowest mileage car you can afford. 
 
Thirdly, buy one that's box stock.  That means not modified, not messed with, 
just as God and Dr. Porsche intended.  Some "good" mods though are Carrerra 
tensioners and later style clutch replacement for the SC's.  Your "Porsche" 
mechanic can explain these to you.  The 1975 you described sounds likes it's 
worth 1/3 what he may "part with it for" even though he could have invested 
thousands to make it like that.  Generally, altered cars aren't worth as much 
as stockers.  Generally, they're not as driveable.  Like most cars, newer is 
indeed better.  Porsche worked hard to make the cars better every year.  Most 
mods don't make the car more driveable, only less driveable for street use. 
  
Fourthly, find a good independent Porsche mechanic and pay him to thoroughly 
check out the car.  Your local Exxon station can't do this.  They have their 
idiosyncrisies and only an expert who's seen a lot of them will know what to 
look for, what it'll cost to fix. 
 
Fifthly, $25,000 is sufficient dinero to find a really nice, low mileage car. 
I've seen some nice Cabriolets(convertibles) in that range, lot's of nice 
Targas and coupes.  The market is a bit depressed right now so there are good 
values out there. 
 
Sixtly, but it, drive it, love it.

Hi all.  I am planning to buy a Porsche or possibly a BMW.
On Sunday, as I was driving along I noticed a fellow with
2 Porsche 911's in his driveway.  Both are 1975 Silver
Anniversary models.  One for his wife and one for him.
His car has been rebodied with an '88 body with the fender
flairs and tail, as well as the engine has been replaced with
a 3.0 litre. (has about 10,000 miles since rebuild).  The
body looks really good.  
In the course of our conversation, he sounded like he would
sell the car, as he is looking for another project car.
What sort of things should I look out for?
He indicated that he would let the car go for about $25,000.
He is planning on replacing the shocks next week but I'm
not sure if that would include new rear tires or not.
Any comments appreciated.  I know very little about these
cars.
Thanks in advance.  Ed

Hi, 
I'm new to this list and own an 84 944.

Ever since I bought the car (used, 4 yrs ago)
it has had a bad wheel shimmy at right around 70mph.
It seemed like an out of balance wheel, or maybe
a bearing.  Tire pressure changes the exact speed
where this happens. Other than that it's smooth
as glass.

Much inspection, balancing, visit to dealer, alignment
etc. did nothing to solve the problem.  I recently
put on new Goodrich comp TA's which helped some.

It doesn't do it on a REALLY smooth road.

Has anyone else had this experience?  I've heard that
it is not uncommon.  If so, what is the cure (short

Subject: 914  Restoration of pedal box mount.


914 Restoration of pedal box floorpan area.

  Another item from my archives...
  In performing a holistic crossover from Weber carbs to oem fuel injection, 
I have
snagged on a couple items;  bad fuel lines and a broken throttle control.

  Abstract:
  The throttle pedal on a 914 is a rubber covered steel structure with an 
embedded
hinge.  The hinge is enclosed in rubber and tends to rust out, making an 
imprecise
throttle control.   A new  throttle pedal is about $35.
  My luck ran out long ago, and so not only was the pedal hinge gone, but 
the bolts
securing it to the floorpan were frozen, twisting the rusty metal and 
ripping a hole in the
pan when attempting removal.

  Repair procedure:
  Remove pedal box assembly.
  With an angle die grinder, and a 1mm cutting wheel,  cut a 3 inch by 12 
inch segment
from the pan under where the pedal box assembly mounts.  Orient the cut to 
encompass the rigidity structure under the floor pan, stopping the cut just 
below the master cylinder mounting studs. (no need to totally remove the 
stiffener underneath)

  Inspection of this structure shows massive rust and thinning to the point 
of ruin.  This segment must be reconstructed.  The technique is variable, 
ranging from the purchase of a torched part, or fabrication of a new 
structure.  I choose fabrication, from flat stock.  Measure the rectangular 
hole you just cut, and begin by laying out a flat piece for the floorpan, 
sized to fit as appropriate for MIGing in place (1/16 gaps).

  Fabricate the stiffener from drawings made from original.  Cut and size a 
single piece for bending on a brake, or construct from flat stock.  I choose 
flat stock because
bending this channel would require a Di-Acro, I reserve use of that for only 
the worst
situations. (I would have to ask someone to do this for me).
  Using flat stock of needed shape and size, brake bend the 'halves' of the 
channel, then weld the channel into one structure.  Not as pretty as a 
single, bent piece, but just as strong for this application.

  It is now time to replicate the mountings for the pedal and pedal box.
  The throttle pedal is fastened with two M6 X 16 bolts, and the pedal box 
is held with two M8 X 16 bolts at the floor, and two bolts at the front 
bulkhead, shared by the brake master cylinder.  Carefully index these 
fasteners using the original part as pattern.
  With two M6 nuts, spot mig weld these after drilling pilot holes.  Check 
the fit constantly as you work because welding can warp dimensions.  Weld in 
all nuts and fasteners into the structure, and combine the two segments into 
one solid piece.
 With all holes, studs, and nuts in place it is now time to prepare the 
floorpan site for fitment and welding.

  Thoroughly clean the site of rust and bituminous/pvc coatings, then offer 
up the patch to see how the edges line up and how much gap exists around the 
periphery.
  Adjust the patch (or hole) to fit, then begin tack welding, first at 
corners then at sides alternating similar to torque sequencing head bolts. 
 Tack weld all around until the tacks are one inch apart, then weld fill in 
the entire periphery.  Check penetration of welds to insure fusion, then 
grind weld beads smooth, but not flush to panel.  Inspect again for voids, 
fill in.
  Coat the bare metal with 'cold galv' spray inside and out, then apply 
bituminous sheet to affected area.  On underside of body, restore coating 
integrity with spray undercoat of rubberized variety.
  Let dry and reattach hardware.

  Procedure complete.

I am curious, however, why it has to be an "independent Porsche mechanic."

Subject: Re:  914 Brakes

George,

I've done the front calipers on the rear conversion that you mention.
I actually used early calipers on the rear and changed to a late
frontend (my early one broke - another interesting story...).  The
tricks are that 1) you have to reshape the hard brake lines to line
up with the new locations on the calipers, and 2) you have to shim 
(I used washers) the calipers to get the alignment correct.  
The great thing about this is that you don't have to do the venting
clearance on the rears anymore.  I also just change front pads and
move the older ones to the rear.

Next, you want to adjust the proportioning valve to balance all this
out.  I've done that too.  I used a tilton with the indented settings.
I did this because I saw what a friend went through with one that had
a knob, but not detents to tell where you were setting it.  This way,
I know how many clicks to get it to setup the way I like it on short 
or long tracks.  Again, the hard lines needed some rework and the location
isn't ideal (I'd use extra line if I did it again) as I put it in the
location of the stock valve.  Once again, if you change the rear calipers,
this is really handy.  I got my valve from Automotion about 5 years ago.

As for the ultimate in getting it to stop, the best thing is a good
bleed.

Not much in my eyes.  Kids fit in back seat of 911.  4 cylinders is less than
6 cylinders.  Body not galvanized.  Newest one nearly 20 years old.  Need two
elbows on one arm to service engine through mail slot.  But that's about it.

I miss the feeling of driving the world's most comfortable go-cart.  In a non-
rustbelt climate, I'd call a 914 a great choice.  Mine needed to be a year-
round car (I once drove home in 8 inches of unplowed snow) and that shortens
the life of a 914 body too much.

I don't get the feeling that Porschephiles have an attitude about 914s at all,
unless the 914 has a 454 V8 with stock brakes, or a stock engine with full
ground effects fiberglas badly done.

Subject: Targa Noises, 944 Rear Suspension

Deat Porsche Friends:
	First a tip for all Targa owners. I just recently replace the two
plastic covers that go on the rear Targa top positioning pins. It has reduced
top noises tremmendously! I guess after 10 years of body flex they tend to take 
a setting.

I was able to use an utility knife (BE CAREFUL!!) and some pliers to strip the
covers off the metal pins. I then used a heat gun to soften the plastic
covers and facilitate insertion. The metal pins have ridges that match the
covers. It took about 15 min.

Now an 85.1 944 question:
	After reading Jim Pasha's excellent suspension article in Excellence
(thanks Jim!), I was looking at my car's rear suspension in order to set it
level. I noticed that it was missing what it appears to be the camber adjusting
nut.

Looking at the diagram from Jim's article, I have (going from back to front)
2 mounting bolts, hole in front plate with elongated hole in back plate (no 
bolt through it), toe adjustment bolt/rear sway bar attachment, two height
adjustment bolts.

It looks like an excentric nut/bolt is missing from the camber adjustment hole

Is this normal? I know the spec book calls for both camber & toe for the rear
wheels. Is my camber not adjustable? I would assume that both should be...

Am I missing something?

Thanks in advance!

Hello 'philes,

The first snowfall and hailstorm we had today is a good indication it's time 
to start on my winter project.

I've got an '80 3.0 SC engine sitting in my father's garage on some blocks of 
wood.  It hasn't been in a car for a couple of years.  Is there anything 
special I should do to it before firing it up when it is bolted into my car?

I'm thinking about buying Carrera tensioners since now seems like a good time 
to install them.  Is the installation relatively straightforward?

This engine will have 40mm Webers....I have some stock 2.0 manifolds for the 
carbs.  What would be a good style of "basic" porting for these?  Just 
matching the ports to the heads and carbs so the holes are the same size and 
line up?  This will be for street use so throttle response is key.  I'm not 
interested in "flowing" the manifolds and heads on a bench, just making sure 
that the stock tiny manifold ports aren't going to be too small for the 3.0 
engine.  Maybe they are fine the way they are....

Thanks,

cubic inches." (Or overhead cams, big ports, big valves, etc.) Let's face 
it, most new "Sports cars" are more than a match for the 914 when it 
comes to acceleration. Why not get the best of both worlds, a 914/6!

Subject: Nearly Free to Targa Owners!

I was cleaning up yesterday and found a couple of Porsche parts I'm
not likely to need in the near future -- the highly hard-to-find
but not-real-expensive 911.542.066.41 and .40 -- those litle rubber
tip gizmos that are on the top rear part of the front "vent window"
sealing the window channel where it contacts the top side seal.

Tips will be sent COD for shipping costs to the the Targa owner
(be fair -- no posers allowed!) that provides me with the best
essay on why I should give them the set in under 100 words. All entries
must be recieved by midnight Sunday Nov. 6, 1994.

Subject: Misc. Qs

G.E. Szeto asked whether Zymol was worth the price and what other good 
waxes are available.
- ---
I have applied Zymol products and, more recently, a two-part (polish 
and sealant) acrylic product called "Klasse" on my 1992 968 (polar silver 
metallic).  Following are impressions from a non-concours user.

Ease of manual application:  The Klasse polish and sealant went on with half 
the effort and twice the speed of the Zymol cleanser and wax, which iself is 
relatively easy to apply.

Appearance:  Equally good.  (Actually, the Zymol coating appeared blotchy in 
certain lighting situations, but in fairness this may have been due to an 
uneven application in my inexpert hands.)  I believe each were rated equally 
good by Consumer Reports in the "superpremium" category--but consider the 
source.

Cost:  I did not keep records, but my impression is that each are equally 
expensive.

Durability:  The jury is out.  The Zymol lasted 12 months on my garaged car 
which is not driven in snow.

Feel:  The Zymol coating feels like the usual slick wax.  The Klasse, on the 
other hand, feels like, in the words of its brochure, "like polished marble."

Bottom line:  I would recommend the Klasse acrylic for a daily driver, but 
I'm sure concours experts have their own wax favorites over the mop 'n glo 
approach.

Subject: Distributor End Float

Those of you who have been reading my distributor
questions won't be surprised at this one.  Does
anyone know the end float spec, i.e., how much
the shaft is allowed to move up and down vertically,
for my '72 911E Bosch distributor?  It's not in
the spec book.

Barring the spec for my particular distributor, there
must be a general rule of thumb.  Anyone know it? 

There are shims on the shaft that obviously are there
to adjust end float, but sevceral of mine have given
up the ghost.  

I think it's important to get it pretty close to
right, because otherwise timing will jump around a
bit as the shaft rises and falls with engine speed,
going up as speed increases, down as it decreases.

Subject: Monthly Update

November 1994

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

Well, it's been another crazy month... 

No, I did not wash away in the floods that buried the Houston area last week.
I was DAMNED glad that I'm doing most of my work from home these days
though -- at 4:30 AM on Tuesday, Oct 18th, I would have had to have driven
through over 2 feet of water to off the reservation.

Speaking of driving through high water, life without U-boat 911 has been 
interesting. Driving a 32 year old car every day is, well, different. Plus, 
there was the brake job from hell that I'll write about in the next week or two.
Still, it's a kick and I think I'll keep it up, but may have to go looking
for a BN-4 over next summer...

List membership is at 875, with the split between digest and message-at-a-time
right at 50-50. Growth continues, as we're up about 30 from last month,
but we're not seeing the meteoric increases of last year. LOTS of people
sign up for about three days then drop off due to message load.

I finally bit the bullet and wrote still smarter software to break 
up the mailings in to smaller byte-sized packages, with a max of 40
distinct domains per envelope. The result was staggering -- mean queue
time for Porschephiles mail went down from about 9 hours to a grand
total of about 20 minutes. Please forgive me for having not done this
years ago.

The digest is again improved -- the same new software will auto-send
the digest before it 43k bytes to avoid some of the limits that many of 
the on-line services have, and uses the domain matching software that
the main list uses. Once a few bugs were ironed out, this month saw
digest issues number 911, 914, 917, 924, and 928. 944 is still a ways
off, but we hit the high spots otherwise!

More new software is in the works -- one of my staff is playing with
an FTPmail package that would let you send mail to a server and get
specific files returned to you. This will let those of you on services
which do not yet support FTP to access the archives and images library.
Should see deployment before the end of the year.

COPYRIGHT AND FAIR USAGE STATEMENT

The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence by and between
members of a closed community. As such, the copyright for EVERYTHING that 
ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 18 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

FINAL NOTE: As I noted in a prior mailing, the FTP restriction above applies 
to major downloading of stuff from the archives, not WWW access. Suggestions 
for improving the WWW pages would be welcomed, as well as experienced help
in doing so.

CLUB-INFO

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, PLEASE join!!

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 if you have to.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Scott,
When I had the same problem with my '80 SC I discovered it wasn't
the drain plug that stripped, but rather it was the sump plate itself.
The plate with threaded drain plug hole was no longer available and
had been superseded by a later style sump plate. It sure makes 
changing your oil messy! If you really did strip the plug only, try
CarQuip at 1-303-443-1343 for a used one. Also, if you're not already
a member PCA, join and when you receive you first issue of Pano
you won't have to wonder where to find 'little bits' anymore!
Good luck!

Subject: Stereo stuff for a 944

	I am slowly upgrading the sound system on my 944.  I just dropped
in a deck and CD Changer, and am looking at getting an amp and some new
speakers.  My question is:  does anyone have good Ideas for where I can put 
things like an amp and subwoofer (probably a 6 1/2" sub) without them being 
obvious and/or cutting into the cabin space too much.  I.E. is there any hidden
space in this vehicle?  I am already using the space behind the driver's seat
and would like to pretend that I can stuff a 3rd person in the car if necessary.

Oh wow, and here I am spending all this money on the Autobahn stuff
($13/gallon) which is harder than ____ to find unless you go to the dealer
!!! Actually, I was using Prestone for a while, but in speaking with my
Porsche mechanic, he said to get it out of there. I finally asked, "Ok,
everyone says not to use Prestone (ie - any coolant with phos.), but
knowbody can tell me WHY !!!!".

        *** Why can't we use regular, plain old antifreeze ***

Well, he said that it will eat the head gasket away over a period of time.
So the stuff is okay for aluminum, but apparently eats head gaskets for
lunch !!! He told me about instances where the gasket was eaten out to the
outside of the engine and it looked like rice krispies on the side of the
engine where the head joined the block.

Any comments on this from anyone else ???

Pat:

        I recently had the same problem with my '84 944. I had plain old
cookie cutters and I found the reason the car shimmied was because the
cookies weren't very true. The shimmy completely went away when I obtained
a nice set of 15" Fuchs alloys (from a 944 friend who owed me money, but
who couldn't pay and hey - his wheels looked mighty good ...).

I suppose this isn't really a good solution though.

I have been told that any combination of balance/tire roundness/wheel
trueness can greatly affect 944s (particularly the earlier cars). You may
want to have your wheels trued.

Subject: 1967 Porsche 912 wiring question


A friend just bought the above car, but the windshield wiper motor was shot.
She neglected to note the wiring of the motor before she pulled the wires 
off to remove it, and now we're somewhat stuck.
Anybody got a schematic?  Or the same car?

6 wires:
   2 Brown, still hooked to the wiper motor frame (ground)
   1 Red
   1 Blue
   1 Black w/ yellow stripe
   1 Black w/ magenta stripe

and the motor terminals that the wires hook up to look like:

                       /--------\
                      /          \

where the '===' represents a spade connection, mounted on a brown
insulating support, I think (from memory).

She's already looked locally for manuals.  If anyone has a good source
for a manual for this car (you know, loads of trivial details), that would
be great too.  Flame-baiting no doubt, but can I get away with using a
911 manual for some of this stuff?

	  those magnesium anti-corrosion plugs that are placed in the 
	  water jacket. The occasion was the first replacement of such a 
	  plug that I had put into service on my GTV in late 1990.  At 
	  the time I replaced it, I had coincidentally just been asked 
	  about these plugs from a couple of members so my interest was 
	  running high. What I found when pulling the plug, so to speak, 
	  wasn't anything like what I was expecting. Just the opposite, 
	  in fact. Finding out just what was going on in my cooling system 
	  reads like a detective story and even put my college chemistry 
	  to the test!

          So, do these plugs work? Let's find out...

          BEYOND PRESTONE,
          THE CHEMISTRY OF COOLING
          By Jack Hagerty

          Sigh. It used to be so simple. Once a year in the Fall, you'd
          drain the radiator, pour in a gallon of "antifreeze" and fill it
          the rest of the way with the garden hose. If you were really
          meticulous, you'd run a can of "fast flush" around first and
          maybe even risk second degree burns opening the block drain. That
          was "cooling system maintenance" in the good old days. When did
          it get so complicated?

          Antifreeze has become "coolant" and is used year 'round.
          Manufacturers, especially those whose engines contain major
          pieces made of aluminum, admonish us to use nothing but distilled
          or de-ionized water with it in the system. Now we're supposed to
          be putting little plugs of magnesium into the water jacket to
          prevent corrosion. Is all this really necessary? In a word,
          yes...and no.

          The Setup

          Back in the summer of 1990 I began to lose coolant from my GTV at
          a slow but continuous rate. I did the usual things like checking
          all the hose clamps, looking for green stains on the block or
          green puddles on the floor, all to no avail. My detective work
          ended that October when the consumption rate suddenly jumped and
          I began to hear a sizzling sound in the exhaust manifold after
          shutting down. It turns out I had breached the cooling jacket
          around the #1 exhaust valve and was sucking coolant directly into
          the exhaust system! This is not an uncommon problem on Alfas
          whose owners have neglected the cooling system. The castings
          around the valve seats are some of the thinnest in the engine and
          are one of the first places to corrode through. But I am the
          original owner of the car and have flushed and changed the
          cooling system at the factory recommended intervals using nothing
          but coolant and de-ionized water the whole time.

          Even though there was no sign of corrosion anywhere on the head,
          it was theorized that an inclusion (bubble) in the head casting
          may have made the jacket wall even thinner than normal, and after
          15 years and 240,000 miles it finally corroded through despite
          the excellent care the cooling system had received. With this in
          mind, I decided to add a magnesium anti-corrosion plug as extra
          protection for the new head. [Just for the record, an autopsy on
          the old head revealed that it was not a bubble in the casting,
          but a crack that had propagated back from the left A/C mount that
          did the damage]

          The technical name for these plugs is "sacrificial anode" since
          the magnesium sacrifices itself to the corrosion gods to protect
          the aluminum in your engine. Just how it does that we'll get to
          in a moment, but with a name like that you'd expect that the
          magnesium cylinder would be slowly dissolved away until nothing
          was left, right? So would I. That's why it was such a big
          surprise last May when I decided to replace the plug with a new
          one. Rather than a little withered stump of magnesium, I found a
          swollen mass of crusty white and tan deposits! They looked just
          like the stuff you find forming on the edges of faucets in hard
          water areas. What was going on here? To find out, I asked a
          couple of experts in the field of ion chemistry. To understand
          their answers, though, we've got to do a little refresher course
          in just what ions are.

          Ion Drive

          The world is made up of molecules and molecules are made of
          atoms. Normally, atoms and molecules are electrically neutral
          with the same number of positive and negative charges. But
          through some chemical reactions, they can be split apart and wind
          up with an unbalanced number of electrons. These electrically
          unbalanced atoms are called ions. If there is a surplus of
          electrons, the ion is negative; if a deficit, the ion is positive
          (and probably the only time you'll hear a deficit referred to as
          "positive"). Generally speaking, atoms don't like to be
          unbalanced and go about looking for ways to balance their
          charges. They do this by finding other ions of the opposite
          charge to bond with, or by finding molecules that have their
          electrons bound less tightly and grabbing one. Electricity, which
          can be considered nothing more that a stream of negative ions
          (electrons), will help these reactions right along. Mixing the
          right ions in a water solution and adding some electrical
          stimulus can do all sorts of wonderful things like plate gold out
          onto common metals. It can also eat holes in your cylinder head.

          There is a definite pecking order in the chemical world which
          chemist call the electrochemical scale. The higher up the scale,
          the more aggressive the ion is. Those elements towards the bottom
          of the scale are always getting beat up by elements further up.
          These lower elements are said to be more "reactive" since they
          are always being forced to bond with the higher elements. Metals
          are among the most reactive elements and one of the most reactive
          metals is, you guessed it, aluminum.

          The Source

          So, where do these ions come from? Is there any way to protect
          against them? Well, I wouldn't be writing this if there weren't!

          It turns out that water is a great solvent for a lot of
          materials. Common table salt, sodium chloride, will immediately
          disassociate into sodium+ and chlorine- ions when placed in
          water. Chlorine is a very aggressive ion and will form aluminum
          chloride when it comes in contact with aluminum metal. This is
          closely related to aluminum chlorhydrate, the underarm deodorant.
          Try to imagine the material in your Ban extra wide stick holding
          back the fires of combustion and I think you'll begin to
          appreciate the problem! There are plenty of minerals in ionic
          suspension in tap water as well. These are what give water its
          characteristic "flavor" and are partially responsible for making
          it taste different from city to city. You can bet that none of
          these minerals are doing your engine any good. Worse yet, there
          are plenty of chlorine ions in the water left over from the
          treatment process to kill bacteria. It's beginning to become
          clear why Alfa recommends only distilled or de-ionized water in
          the cooling system!

          [This is a good point for an aside on purified water. Distilled
          water is purified by boiling it to steam, which leaves all of the
          ions behind to recombine into the crusty mineral deposits found
          at the bottom of your teakettle. De-ionized water, on the other
          hand, is purified by pulling the ions out by an electrical
          process. This leaves the water very neutral electrically, but
          non-charged components in the water, such as dissolved gasses
          (which we'll get to later) remain behind. This is a cheaper
          process than distilling and makes the water pure enough for
          anything short of laboratory use]

          It would seem, then, that the best thing to put in our cooling
          systems would be pure, distilled or de-ionized water, right?
          Well, as the Wizard says, "not so fast!"

          More Problems

          Even ignoring the boiling and freezing problems associated with
          using only water, there still would be problems using just plain
          distilled or de-ionized water for cooling. When researching this
          article, I talked with Dick Hagen of Shrader Scientific who has
          made a career of making ions do all sorts of useful things. When
          I mentioned using de-ionized water in the cooling system, he
          blanched and related the following story:

          Years ago, while working for another company, he was in charge of
          the high power radio frequency tubes used by the company in their
          processing equipment. These tubes were water cooled and to make
          sure the water was extra pure, it was supplied by an industrial
          de-ionizer (the same type that makes the d-i water you buy in the
          store). Most of the plumbing in the system was plastic except for
          one galvanized iron elbow and the silver cooling jackets around
          the tubes themselves. It seems that the iron elbow was always
          corroding away so finally they replaced it with a plastic one
          only to find that in one week the silver jackets became swiss
          cheese and the $10,000 tubes were ruined!

          What had happened? Well, in the absence of other types of ions,
          water, known to some chemists as HOH (that H2O stuff is really an
          outdated 19th century term), will spontaneously decompose into
          hydrogen (H+) and hydroxyl (OH-) ions. The hydroxyl ion is almost
          as aggressive as chlorine and it was attacking the zinc and iron
          elbow. It left the silver jacket alone since silver is much
          further up the electrochemical scale, but once they replaced the
          iron elbow with plastic, the hydroxyl had nothing to go for but
          the silver.

          Yikes! Does this mean that all the times I'd been putting
          de-ionized water into my cooling system (and recommending to
          others that they do the same) I'd really been eating my engine
          away? Fortunately, no. The problem above was that the system had
          an active de-ionizer in it. As fast as the water produced the
          hydroxyl ions which attacked the plumbing, the de-ionizer pulled
          them out (along with the metal they had attacked). If they had
          just left it alone, the water would have eventually saturated and
          the corrosion would have stopped.

          The Solutions

          Did everyone catch the moral of that story? It contains the
          explanation of how the magnesium plug works. As I said earlier,
          aluminum is one of the most reactive metals, so for this
          anti-corrosion scheme to work we have to find a metal even more
          reactive. We don't have much choice. Sodium is so reactive that
          it will grab oxygen out of the air and start to burn as soon as
          you open the lid. Potassium is even worse; it will burn under
          water! That leaves only magnesium which is reasonably stable in
          air and water, but still lower on the scale than aluminum.

          So, finally, we get to the crusty brown deposits. To find out
          what was going on, I talked with Dr. Carl Nelson, a chemist with
          a computer disk manufacturer who holds several patents on the ion
          plating of disks and other materials.

          "Yes, the magnesium metal is being sacrificed" Dr. Nelson said,
          "but it's not going anywhere. Here, let me show you."

          With that he whipped out a pencil and scribbled down the
          equation:

          2Mg + 2H2O + O2 = 2Mg(OH)2

          [Actually, there were three equations ahead of this one showing
          how water splits into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, and magnesium
          metal into magnesium ions and free electrons, but this one summed
          them all up.]

          "You see how two atoms of magnesium will combine with two
          molecules of water to form two molecules of magnesium hydroxide?"

          "Uh, yeah," I answered, "but what is that oxygen molecule (O2)
          doing in there?"

          "Oh, that's just the dissolved oxygen in the water. If that
          weren't there, this reaction would give off hydrogen gas."

          "Oh, great." I said, "It's not bad enough that the battery gives
          off hydrogen while charging, now we have to worry about the
          cooling system too?"

          "No, not at all," he replied. "All water contains some dissolved
          gasses. Even distilled water, which starts out with very little,
          will pick it up on exposure to air [such as in a coolant recovery
          tank - JH]."

          "But, back to the equation," I returned, "magnesium hydroxide
          is..."

          "...this crumbly tannish white material on the plug" he
          completed, turning the lumpy remains of my $20 anti-corrosion
          plug over in his hands. "It's doing its job!"

          The Bottom Line

          So now we have professional confirmation that these plugs really
          work. But are they necessary?

          You may have noticed something in our little chemistry lesson
          above: It was all done assuming that the reaction was taking
          place in just water. What we all have (or at least should have)
          in our cooling systems is a 50/50 mix of water and "coolant". How
          does that affect things?

          Pretty marginal, as it turns out. The ethylene glycol in the
          coolant is pretty stable and doesn't really join into the
          reactions, not when you have reactants like magnesium and
          hydroxyl running around! Just to make sure, though, the
          manufacturers of automotive coolants add "anti-corrosion
          packages" to the mix. These are simply controlled amounts of
          different minerals already in ionic suspension, very likely some
          form of magnesium compound (although I didn't confirm this with
          any of the manufacturers). You can even buy them separately as a
          can of "corrosion inhibitor." They should provide enough source
          material to keep your system safe from the nasty hydroxyls for at
          least a year.

          Recommendations

          So, what should we do? The consensus boils down to this. You
          should change your coolant mix regularly. This means once a year
          if you live in a place that has winter, or you can go a bit
          longer in places like the Bay Area (I personally do mine ever
          24,000 miles which works out to every 18 months). Between
          draining and refilling you should use something to clean out the
          system. If the old coolant is still clear then you could get away
          with just some "fast flush", but if the coolant is murky or
          rusty, then one of the "heavy duty" cooling system cleaners would
          be better. Just make sure it says "Safe for Aluminum" on it.

          After flushing, fill with one gallon of coolant and top off with
          a gallon of distilled or de-ionized water. The latter is probably
          preferable since it already contains some dissolved oxygen. The
          four cylinder Alfa cooling system holds almost exactly two
          gallons, but you might have to run the car a couple of times to
          work out all the trapped air before you can fit the whole gallon
          of water. Never use water from the garden hose to do the final
          fill since you have no idea what's in it besides water, and
          believe me, there's plenty (remember the chlorine?). It's ok to
          use it for the intermediate flushes, though.

          If you're loosing coolant, don't just top off with water since
          you'd be diluting the coolant thus reducing both the thermal and
          chemical protection properties. Try to keep the 50/50 mix up.

          Finally, do you need the magnesium plug? Well, that's strictly
          personal choice. I ran my engine for more than 15 years and
          240,000 miles without one and there wasn't a trace of corrosion
          on the head when I took it off. On the other hand, looking at the
          amount of magnesium reduced to lumpy white powder in just a year
          or so, convinces me that something powerful is going on in there.
          Personally, I wouldn't be without one.

Subject: Wintertime 912 stuff

     Well, there's snow in the forcast tonight...I thought I'd have more
time. The 911's going into the garage under the car cover and I need to take
care of the little cold weather things on the 912...and I have a few
questions.
     Where does the hot air for the rear window defroster come from? Mine
barely blows anything at all. The rest of the heater system blasts hot air.
     Is there anything I can do about the exhaust smell that come out of my

     Is there any way to lube a noisy tach cable?
     Thanks in advance!

David J. Christiano said: "As an owner of both a 911 and 914, I can say
there's nothing wrong with the handling of the 914. If anything, it's better
(certainly more tame) than the 911. But as they say in Detroit, "There ain't
no substitute for cubic inches." (Or overhead cams, big ports, big valves,
etc.) Let's face it, most new "Sports cars" are more than a match for the
914 when it comes to acceleration. Why not get the best of both worlds, a
914/6!"

David, when I had my 2.0 liter 914-4 with a Dwight Mitchell engine
(Production class), Garretson Phase 9 header system, and the usual
suspension and alignment tricks, I just loved to meet up with a 911 or 914-6
driver on the road. And I didn't care if the road went straight, turned
every so often, or had an occasional stop sign.

Of course, driving it to Colorado Springs and back from Sacramento on
CompTAs damned near killed me.

Subject: Re: Coolant Questions


On the subject of the immense treatise on the
chemistry (and perils) of water-pumping as a means
of cooling motor-car engines, well all I can say is
don't try this at home kids. All my motor cars and 
motor cycles have always been air-pumpers, and to be
honest the idea of putting *WATER* in a motor car
engine seems, well, unnatural. I know that I am going
to get flamed by people who will say, `ah, well you
can be as enthusiastic as you like about air-pumping,
but the science of cooling motor car engines says it is
dead-in-the-water because you can't cool multi-valve
heads with air' Well it's a real shame if in the future
the 911 goes multi-valved and water-pumping, but I guess
the moral of this story is that you can take a Porsche
to water, but you can't make it drink.

     Hello files,

     I have just installed my 930's engine after removing it to have the turbo
     rebuilt.  I have also replaced the spark plugs (damn are these expensive).

     After everything was together, I turned the key, only to have the engine
     turn over extremely weakly, as if the battery was lacking oomph.  So I
     jumped the battery to an operational 911, and got the same effect.  I
     assumed I had a bad ground, so I polished the ground contact from the
     transmission to the frame.  I also polished the starter contact.  It did
     not change the situation.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i just had my motor out last week on my dp935 turbo, and had a simmilar problem
would turn over but not start,problem endout being the red wire that comes
from the alternator and goes to a lug on the starter was bad,symptom was it would turn over but not start,also there was no power to the cd unit,you should
hear it whisling with the key on but also you should have 12 volts on the red/white wire going to it, anyways fixing the crimp on lug on the red wire on the starter fixed the problem

take care, joe povilaitis

Bart:

        The story about the blown up whale is TRUE !!

        After a little research and digging around, I found an avi file of the 
news broadcast.

        ftp cathouse.org /pub/cathouse/urban.legends/gif/whale.avi

        11 megs total.

        You'll need Video for windows 1.1's media player to view it, if you 
can't get ahold of it, maybe I can mail it to you.

        quailty of the avi file is poor, but content is UNBELIEVABLE !!

The only place that really comes to mind are the two little cubbyholes in
the rear, together with the space where the spare tire sits.  The "brain"
of my cell phone is shared with the spare tire, though I may have this
removed to make room for a larger amp and use the side spaces for speakers.
I have yet to commit to a custom stereo installation, so I will be reading

Hi, Triet.
 
Does that mean Sierra WILL kill neighborhood pets if disposed of legally?
Just a thought, and a possibility...
 
There is such a thing as a coolant filter, sort of. Problem engines that
have had scale build up in their water passages can benefit from this (iron
blocks, not our Porsches). A radiator specialist whom I know and trust (he
has done lots of small jobs for me on other cars and NEVER asked to be paid!
These jobs were too small for him to consider them anything other than
favors) says that the coolant system flush preparations don't get all the
scale out, and may cause more problems than they solve, by breaking loose
scale that keeps coming off after you've drained the flush chemicals and are
driving again. To keep those scale particles from clogging the radiator,
radiator shops have a screen that can be installed in the radiator hose. Not
a filter, a screen. Which he says may help a little, but nothing short of
hot-tanking the stripped block will take care of it permanently.

Subject: Stereo stuff for 944

Amp: My amp is in the front passenger kickwell, mounted upside down to a 
board, underneath the glove compartment.
Pros: Accessible, close to head unit, hard to see from outside the car 
(depends on size of amp though), doesn't get wet when car leaks (had a big 
problem for a while with door window seals, after a hard rain, I could see 
the water over the carpets of the car-thank god for those $.75 car vacs)
Cons: Heats up the footwell, passenger kicks it when they fall asleep, very 
easy for the thief to remove, can't fit megabuck 1000w/channel competition 
amps- of course all of these cons could be taken as pros in certain 
situations.

Subs: I have a 6.5" SAS powered Bazooka in my rear passenger footwell. It 
cannot be seen when the rear seats are folded down (100% of time). It is 
however unpluggable should I need the space, or desire to drop the weight 
or eliminate possible flying inanimate objects;ie. auto-x.) Pretend all you 
want, I have yet to find someone who wanted to sit back there. Was thinking 
of plugging in a 10" Bazooka instead and strapping it to my harness 
bar/velcroing it to the carpet. My girlfriend justs looks at me funny when 
I talk about that though........

IMHO - 944 as platform for rolling boombox sucks. Almost as bad as a 
pickup. Very little space for peripherals, front speakers are odd size and 
too low for good staging. Rear speakers are same odd size and need rear 
quarter windows removed for proper replacement. Popular addition of 6x9's 
includes installing then into the carpet in the back and pointing them at 
the sky. Don't expect miracles.

Rich,
My answers pertain to '67, but should be the same.  The rear window 
defogers come off the ducts that feed the front heaters.  If you close 
off the foot level heat ducts, you force more air to the defogers.  The 
rear defoger hoses are in the engine compartment and pretty easy to 
replace, as I recall.  They may be deteriated.  As to the exhaust smell, 
watch out!  When I had that problem, it turned out to be a cracked 
cylinder.  It was really tough on the ego when the ladies I took out 
always fell asleep in the car!  Turned out I was gasing them.  Exhaust 
smell indicates some sort of leak, header, head or cylinder.  My tach is 
electric, so no experience there.

Ted,

This is the second message today that you've mis-sent to the admin
address. The previous one I just re-sent to the list, because I thought
I still had my "ted trap" running (took all messages in which the word
"ted" appeared and pulled them off the list and sent the to me for approval
to filter out anything with or about Ted Matusmara). This time, though
I looked at the headers, and son of a gun if you didn't *send* it to
"porschephiles-request@tta.com". Since this was in reply to  someone
else, that means you are probably on a system v mailer, and need to be
reeeeeeal careful about just using "reply" to send notes to the list.

Notes to the list go to "porschephiles@tta.com", just a reminder. Since
this is such a good piece that everyone DOES need to see, I'm returning
it so you can re-post.

Thanks,

Stan

Wow, I couldn't have said it better myself!

as supporting evidence to this comment:

I had to take my wife's Mazda in for something I couldn't
diagnose (in retrospect, I could have, if I'd been more 
motivated... never could get into Japanese engineering)
When I picked the car up, the dealer had automatically
replaced the air filter which I had just replaced the previous 
Saturday. The service dweeb said "geez, the thing was totally
gray, and it's supposed to be white" After 5 minutes of inane
arguing, I made him take a new one from Parts out of the box.
I was very glad that it was gray paper like the last one, and
they crossed it off my bill. I can excuse the service writer
who probably is in training to sell used cars anyway, but what
about the mechanic? Either he's stupid or dishonest, period!
Either way, he's not touching one of my cars again.

As far as Porsches, I work on them because I love to - an
amateur in the truest and best sense of the word. I use a
couple of independant mechanics who have the same mania.
As for dealer mechanics, they may feel the same, or they may 
just be doing a job. I've seen too many vice-grip and big 
screwdriver jobs on good cars to trust my car with someone I
don't know.

Subject: 928: No hot start


O Wise Men- 

My 86' 928S will not start when hot.
More specifically, when fully warmed up (~half hour of normal highway driving)
and shut down, it will not restart, unless allowed to first cool off for 15 to
30 minutes.  It turns over vigorously, but does not start up.  After cool-off,
pumping the gas seems to improve rather than impede starting (but this is not
well-established).

Car was bought this July.  Previous owner denies related problems.

Idling car for  two minutes before shutdown does not help.

Car was recently tuned, new plugs, ignition wires, new oxygen sensor.

Local shop does mostly German cars, suggests possible sources of problem as
1) Heat sensor(s).
2) Fuel pump
3) "Ignition system"

As diagnosis should come before therapy, what is a rational way to approach
this?

Inspired guess, cheap and easy to rule in/out?
Plausible guess, ditto?
Systematic exam, no stone unturned?

Is there some symptom, not described because of my ignorance, or not observed
because not purposefully elicited that would be revealing?

The usual advance expressions of profuse appreciation for help fully apply.

Subject: Ratings for Tires


Hi all,

In my post about tires, I mentioned speed rating. This was for a factor
most auto owners never consider, the car was designed to have a specific
tire to assure minimum advertised performance can be met. Then there are 
the TUV (German) standards that enforce replacement with specified speed
rated tires so the owner doesn't go cheap and spread himself over the 
countryside when the rag fails. Rag is an expression in the tire industry 
for a tire that isn't safe unless parked in the driveway (questionable
even there).

Look, I don't care what people put on their cars for tires, it's their 
wallet and car. But when you buy something that is capable of almost Warp
3 on the interstate (three times 65 MPH) consider this: You want control
at all times, the higher speed ratings give you a tire with better 
construction and more steps in the assembly/quality process. In most cases 
there is a definate improvement in low-speed handling as well.

Another consideration, it's now getting cold out. Tire failures will 
increase for a month. WHy? low tire pressure. Check the pressure weekly, 
especially after a freeze. Cold weather causes fluctuations with the 
temperature cycles. The air contracts, lowering the pressure, the opposite
of running on the track. Sidewall failure is the problem with low pressure.
The sidewall isn't supported correctly from the low internal pressure, it
flexes more, generating heat. The heat causes the radial sidewall to 
delaminate, finally rupturing. It takes some time to occur, but will fail
if the pressure isn't corrected.

Size. Well, on a Porsche the OEM delivered size for your wheel size will
work well. Be very careful when using aftermarket wheels. The offsets are,
in a few cases, just different enough to cause rubbing or interference 
on some models. An example: a 914/6 can run 205/60 15 tires on six-inch 
wheels with the standard 911 back-spacing (1965-1989). The same is true of 
a 914/4 if front wheel offset is corrected to clear the front strut. The 
914/4 has a narrower front track because it uses a different front strut/
hub than a 914/6 (this is the best reason I can think of for the five-bolt
conversion). If not corrected, the 205 will rub on the front shock cover
when cornering. (note, the rear fender lips should be rolled because
the bodies are not true from the factory).

So much more can be talked about when it comes to tires. *sigh*

One of the difficulties I have in evaluating an exhaust system is 
seperating noise from actual performance (sure does *sound* faster). I am 
absolutly sure it did nothing to hurt drivability. My impressions are 
that the rush to red line still begun around 4,000 rpm, but had a little 
more urgency to it. Also, prior to the exhaust change, I never hit the 
rev limiter because I could feel I was getting close. For what its worth, 
after the change, I bumped into it a few times before getting used to it. 

I had the same apprehensions as you prior to the change. It has now been 
about two years and I could not be happier with it. I did the exhaust 
change, DME chip change, and advanced the cam timing. Driveability is 
much better than stock as I now have power begining around 2500 rpm as 
opposed to the 3500 in stock configuration. 

Good Luck

If this can be done for the 914, can it also be changed for the 911?  My wipers
are "normal" (park on left), but I'd rather have them park on the right.  That
way, the last pass won't throw water back in front of me on the driver's side.

Subject: Stereo stuff for the 944

In response to: Why don't you guys use your "luggage" compartments (the 
space behind the rear seats)?

On my car,'86 951, this area is the hatch. Which is partially blocked by a 
harness bar mounted to the D pillars. Two weeks ago, the hatch had 3 big 
game fishing outfits, a 54 quart cooler, 4 yellowfin tuna, a sleeping bag, 
bags of chips and microwave dinners, an IBM Model 80, and a full set for 
commercial rain gear and boots in it. Admittedly wasn't auto-xing that day. 
Right now it has the cooler, 3 boat rods, a suit, a Halloween costume, a 
sickle (large implement that the Grim Reaper carries), a case of Mobil 1 
and various Price club purchases in it. I use it. Don't really know what I 
would do if I had a 914. Lack of focus I guess.

Reminds me of my friend with the Corolla who ripped out the rear seat backs 
and mounted BIG woofers there. Cool look. Of course, it is now a 2-seater 
without any usable trunk space.

Lou,

For probably a cost savings, Porsche elected to delete the camber adjustment
bolts from the trailing arms. They serve no other purpose than a means
to adjust the camber. I buy the bolts and put them on my cars, though, as
they will aid in holding the camber setting on the track. For a normal car, 
there's no problem. Make sure the alignment shop you use has the adjuster
bolts, this should tell you whether they know what's going on.

Well, my wife and I have travelled cross country, camping along the
way, in both our 914 and our 944.  As nice as the 944 is to travel in,
the 914 was easier to fit all of our stuff in.  This included, for
each trip, 2 sleeping bags, camp stove, lantern, propane, cooler,
food, 4-man (yeah, right) tent, shovel, hatchet, small broom, chairs,
5 days of clothes for two, eating utensiles, and parts and tools for
doing a tune-up, throttle cable change, clutch cable change (914
only), valve adjustment (914 only), etc. on the side of the road.

Oh, yeah, there was also stuff for attending the Parade each time (2
helmets, gloves, cleaning supplies, etc.)

Still between the two, the 914 seems to hold more.  It's great fun
pulling up next to those 30ft+ motorhomes and pulling out all our
gear.  We've often been asked, in each car, "How did you get all that
stuff in that little car?"

'75 911 with 3.0 engine for $25K - Hah! The basic rule is that anything 
non-original makes value go down, unless it improves something over 
original. '74-'77 911's had engines that were inferior to the ones before 
and after in terms of longevity. A used 3.0 is a good, common swap. If the 
car is like new, and the 3.0 has been rebuilt, it should still be worth 
less than a '78-83 911SC that has never had it's engine swapped. A 
documented '78 SC with say 100K miles and a rebuilt engine would probably 
go for $10K and be a superior car. Run away. Invest the money into 30 year 
T-bills, while you read some books and learn more about Porsches. $25K can 
buy you a lot of used car these days.

'87 911 for $23K - Good price. Suspicious car. Make that a 20K mile car 
owned since new by your brother-in-law who drives a school bus for a living 
and you got something. This independant service shop that I go to had a ad 
that said "Owning a Porsche can be a dream or a nightmare." Never rush to 
buy into someone's nightmare. Unless you get real anal about certain colors 
and certain factory options, you will find many 911's for sale. 
Particularly 80's vintage cars. The 80's were very, very good to Porsche 
and to many people who went out and bought new Porsches. Many '87-89 
Carreras have dealer service only, full records, no engine work, and didn't 
get driven so much. You just want to find one that was babied. Modern cars 
that are street driven for pleasure use by normal people and are serviced 
properly don't blow up engines in less than 100K miles. With some 
owners/cars the cars will look brand new after 100K miles inside and out, 
especially with Porsches. Any major service, like an engine job is an 
issue, because if it wasn't done right, you will pay to do it again. I 
would not touch that car unless the price was dropped by a third or  I 
somehow was willing to bet another $10K that the story was true. Because 
that is exactly what you would be doing by buying this car.

I recently bought a 1987 944 S with 28,000 miles on it.  As I was reviewing
its servicing records, I noticed that at the last oil change (about 2000
miles ago), the mechanic noted that coolant was mixed in with the oil.  After
reading this, I pulled the dipstick to look for anything unusual.  The oil
looked clean to me, however I am concerned about how coolant got mixed with
the oil previously.  

Any suggestions on how the coolant could have become mixed?  How serious of a

oil into the airbox?

Well, having more than a little trouble with this item, I suggest that you
also check your reservoir. Take the cap off and wipe your finger around the
inside to see of there is a brownish foamy residue. If there is, get thee to 
your mechanic soonest, because your o-rings have disintegrated and allowed
oil into the water. I believe the chances of the oil being in the water are
better than the water being in the oil because the oil is under considerabley
more pressure than the water when the engine is operating. Without draining 
the oil, I don't see how you could be sure what the mechanic said is true or 
not. It may be difficult to see water mixed with oil on the dipstick alone.

I just had the following work done to my '78 911 SC:
 -remove Catalytic converter, replace w/ pipe
 -Advance the cam timing (good time to do it since the tensioners were 
being changed).
 -Full service/tuneup
 -Carerra tensioners

There is a very noticeable difference in performance.  It's hard to 
tell which of the above made the biggest difference since the problem 
could just have been a bad tuneup.  I wish I'd done this last spring at 
the beginning of the track season instead of at the beginning of winter 
(though this is my daily driver).

I get power earlier and it revs freely up to redline, something it 
*never* did before.  I have power up to 6300, and this summer it felt 
like I peaked at around 5000 and didn't really go much beyond there.  
I'll know better when I can get on the track and compare with the 
summer's experience.    Next will be replacing the heat exchangers and 
exhaust, but that will have to wait for spring.

This work was precipitated by having the car completely lose power 
while on the freeway doing 70.  I went to pass someone, couldn't 
accelerate.  Then I started losing speed rapidly.  Shortly after that I 
was parked by the side of the road waiting for a tow truck.  My 
mechanic diagnosed the problem in about 30 seconds--the catalytic 
converter had destructed and plugged the exhaust.  The backpressure 
blew one of the exhaust head gaskets as well.  Once he got started on 
the major service (it was due), he discovered the tensioners were 
rattling.  I looked over my receipts for the car, and realized that 
it's the exception when I drive away from the shop without dropping 
close to $1K.

or option 3.  Leave in the 2 shaft and buy a cd changer that plugs in-line with
your antenna.  It has a little remote panel to stick on your dash.  Just tune
to a certain station (it varies w/manufacturer) and play.

     Anyway, I found out from the Maestro that in '69 they changed from the
air pump to Teflon coated intake manifolds to control HC & CO outputs. He
suggested that I upgrade from the '68 pump to the '69 manifolds. So I called
the Dept. of Ecology and they said "sure, no problem"...just thought that
might be of interest to anyone with a '68 912 who might want to lose the air
pump. This is in Washington state, it might be different where you are.

Subject: Re: Porsche/Audi/VW part number equivalency ?

Kristian,

In the US, 914 owners learned years ago that VW parts are frequently
cheaper from Porsche.  Same is true for the 944 series.  My parts guy
and I, for fun, checked a few numbers last year, and all the parts
were cheaper when bought from Porsche.

Of course, pricing frequently follows no rational scheme.  For example,
I recently bought a few M12 x 35 mm bolts (list price $2.65) and
M12 x 40 mm bolts (list price $0.95).  Weird.

Jerry,

After seven years of ownership, I have yet to replace a front wheel
bearing on my car.  They have been repacked only once.  The rears
have been replaced twice, I think.  My friend the professional
mechanic opined recently that 944 front wheel bearings last pretty
much indefinitely if you keep them properly adjusted.

I carry spares in the track paraphernalia.  Per the "umbrella theory,"
this probably explains why I have yet to have one go south.

I don't think it's still in production but you may be able to find a good

Subject: Set valves on 930?

Hi all,

I'm thinking about trying to set the valves on my 84 930. I've got a couple
of questions first.
How difficult will it be to access them? Will I need to lift the car to 
do it ?
What's the easiest way to rotate the engine when moving from one valve to 
the next ?
Is this something I can do without a manual, I know they should be set 
stone cold @ 10mm.
If anyone could give me some pointers I would appreciate it greatly.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: early 944 motor mounts

Pat,

1) Is this common?

Yes.

2) Will replacing the mounts fix it?

Vibration depends on the source.  It *sounds* like you have a bad
mount, but the way to be sure is to measure it.  If it is bad, yes,
replacing it will cure the cold engine, at idle roughness.

3) Can I replace my mounts w/ later 'turbo' style mounts?

Yes.  In fact, there is only a single part available these days,
to my knowledge.  (The .04 part, which oddly enough supersedes the
.05 part.)

4) How bad is the replacement job?

It is beyond good and evil.  It simply is.  Seriously, it isn't
bad, probably something that can be done in under an hour if you
have a lift and have already done a couple.

5) How long can I expect new ones to last?

The newer versions seem to last longer, but I don't really know
expected lifetimes.

Tip: if you do the job yourself, you can save some grief by trimming
about 5 mm off the stud.  It is over long, and shortening a little
make installation much easier.

Subject: Re: 944 S oil mixed with coolant

If ever there were a 944S FAQ, the oil/water mix question would be
first on the list.  The MY87 cars, 944S in particular, had a run of
failures.  What fails is sealing in the oil/water heat exhanger,
allowing fluid to mix both ways.

Any mechanic who has worked with 944 series cars has fixed a bunch
of these over the last seven years, and should be able to take care
of you.  Resealing the exhanger isn't a lot of work.  However,
Porsche decided that in the event of such a failure, you really
ought to check the connecting rod bearings.  Which is a bunch of
work.  (I could give you the book time, if I could remember how
long a Porsche "TU" is.)

Subject: wheel bearings, friend or foe?

Need some net wisdom:
I am prepping my 89 951 track car for next years season. 
I have heard from some "experts" that wheel bearings, specifically on the
front, should be replaced as routine maintenance. I am not sure I agree since
I have never had a bearing fail. I do routinely inspect the outers and they
get re packed on a regular basis. The rollers and the races look fine with no
scoring or galling, and of course they are carefully adjusted before each
event.
Do these items just fail? I have no problem replacing them since the expense
is not great. It just seems like an inspection and re packing with new seals
is sufficient.
Any input?

Carrera is in no way a "Porsche oriented" name in this case -- these
guys make some of the best stock car and dirt track suspension parts
you can buy. Since that often involves a fair degree of configurability,
they do have pieces that work great for 911s. In fact, I've used their
coil-overs for building racing 911s where I needed spring that I
could get using torsion bars.

They're a first class outfit, but you have to do your own "fitness for
use" engineering.

Sorry, but in my experience, oil and water don't mix.... 8{)

Seriously, we used to use Castrol then switched to Valvoline when we
got a sponsorship deal. Even *stayed* with Valvoline when it became
clear that we could negotiate by-the-case prices at Pep Boys that
were better than the by-the-drum prices we had direct... But ever
so rarely will break out a case of the old Castrol bean oil for 
special occassions and very special cars...

Still, Syntec is an OK synthetic (even if they do use the Jack Turner
Test in their commercials). I have used Amsoil SAE-40 and Red Line
Racing SAE 40 and SAE 50 in race motors, am currently using the new
Valvoline 20W50 synthetic in my BMW, Beetle, and my wife's car. 
Modern synthectics are good stuff as long as you change them about like
you change regular oil.

Harry Pellow had good things to say about Syntec in the last 356 Registry.
As long as that doesn't mean that it'll make all your water run out and
half your cylinders fall off, you might take that as an endorsement.

Subject: 944S oil/coolant problem

My 87 944S "used" a tiny bitsy bit of coolant from day 1, with a slight
disappearance for about 3 years until one day I had mucho oil and not so
mucho coolant.  Chris Musante and I fixed it by replacing the oil pressure
relief valve as per the detailed instructions in Tech Bulletin 8904 "Oil
Cooler/Oil Pressure Relief Valve Repair Guide."  As I recall it also took a
special alignment tool in order to get the valve body lined up with the hole
in the side of the block.  I would call this a fairly "tricky" repair which
had I not had Chris' help might have taken me a pretty long time.  Also, it
helps if your forearms are only about 1" in diameter (tight quarters).  
Incidentally, those 1" forearms also come in handy when trying to change a
944S thermostat, since there is almost zip clearance between the thermostat
housing and the side of the motor compartment.  Took me 3 different snap ring
pliers to get the ring out and back in again.  Ahh, the pleasures of R&R with
the motor in the car!

BRAKES: Sure, You Can Do It Yourself
 -or-
Why My Wife Thinks I'm Leaving Her for My Snap-On Salesman

Stan Hanks
NNJR

A few years back, I had the opportunity to acquire a two-owner '64 356SC.
It was a very early car, but it was a "native Texan", had no structural rust 
and was fully documented, so despite it having a ton of miles and the engine 
being in a box, it came to live with me. After building a new engine and 
fixing some annoying electrical problems, it turned out to be a pretty decent 
car.  In fact, since selling my 911SC it became my daily driver.

All this daily driving showed up a few minor deficiencies that I'd overlooked
while it was only driven occassionally. In particular, the brakes just
didn't seem up to snuff. Sure enough, a quick inspection showed that I was
way down on pad material so I decided to pull it off the road for a day
or so to change the pads and deal with a few other service items. Yeah.
Right.

I should have seen this all coming when I discovered that someone had
wandered off with a full rack of my 1/2" drive Snap-On sockets. In particular,
that ever-so-vital 19mm socket. It was Sunday, and I really wanted to
get going, so off to Sears for a Craftsman replacement. OK, as long as I
was there, maybe a whole set of sockets. And a few other things. I had to
leave before I started sounding like Tim Allen...

Socket in hand, I took the wheels off. Well, almost. I had to make another
store run to get a 36" breaker bar. One of the lug nuts had become one
with the wheel. Another omen, but I didn't know that at the time.

Car on four jack stands, wheels off: time to rock and roll. Triage:
brake pads, yup, need them; front rotors, ok; rear rotors, gotta replace
them so I'll do fronts too; calipers, look leaky, I'll rebuild; master
cylinder, leaky; brake hoses, hmmmm I thought those were supposed to be
flexible rubber, not solid rubber.  Worse than I'd hoped, but hey, I had 
a shopping list! Time to call around some on Monday, order by noon, and 
I'll be back on the road well before the weekend!!!

Looking around in the last Registry issue, I find United German Imports 
of Pittstown NJ with a "all the parts you need" brake rebuild package for
around $500. Great, I'll call them. Sure enough, they have the package
but don't have any rear rotors right then. Since I *NEED* them, I elect 
to keep calling. Stoddard, yup, they've got everything -- for about the 
original purchase price of the car.  Zims Autotechnik in Dallas, hey they'll 
have it. Well, almost, but it's close enough -- I can re-use my old pad pins. 
Order away, it's in the mail and sure enough I have it the next day.

Back to the shop. Let's start with taking calipers off. Hmmm, what's this --
the pads don't retract in rear? That's not a good sign. After a large effort,
the calipers all come off and get tossed in a box to be rebuilt. Rotors
come off and go outside for the scrap metal guy to salvage. But my, that's
nasty black stuff on the right side... Oh no! A rear seal leak!! Better
have a look at the front seals -- sure enough, they're bad too. Bearings?
I can't tell but let's order them anyway... Back on the phone, and some
parts are coming from Zims, and some from Stoddard. Ouch.

What to do until they arrive? A-hah! The master cylinder and the hoses.
Take out the trunk liner and access plate, and hmmmm -- that steering
coupler is *supposed* to be one piece isn't it?? Back to the phone. Despite
a flyer from NLA Limited in Reno saying that they're available, Brad Ripley 
says he sold the last he had and now they're not available from him,
only from Porsche. Call Stoddard again. Sure, it's $150 we have
one in stock. I ask them "in stock on the computer, or in stock in stock?"
They check. It seems that its one of those not-quite-in-stock items. Back
order to Germany, 7 to 15 weeks. I'll keep calling. Finally order the last 
one actually in North America from Foreign Intrigue. Back to the brakes.

Master cylinder isn't too hard to do, but I can't even slightly move the
fittings on the brake hoses. I call around, find that my wimpy flare nut
wrenches aren't the hot setup, I need the *SPECIAL* 20" flare nut wrenches
that let you get enough leverage on the fitting. I beg, plead, and eventually
borrow a set. My Snap-On salesman frowns. And I break a banjo fitting in the 
process. Fortunately, before Stoddard shipped the other order.

OK, there's a light in the end of the tunnel and it's not a train... On
to the rear seals. About this time (well over 10 days from the start of
this project) I hear from Robert Albrecht who is changing the rear wheel
bearings his car, and notes that the spec for the 36mm nut is 400 ft-lbs
and that can't be right. I assure him that it is, wish him luck and 
congratulate myself for not having that problem. Until about a hour later
when it hits me that I *DO* have that exact problem. OK, I'll just borrow
the Ingersall-Rand heavy-duty double-hammer impact.... except I'm doing
this in my race-car storage warehouse, not the real racing shop, so I
don't have air.

What to do... I try the 5 foot cheater bar approach. I try heat. Nope,
this is definitely going to take air. So I do the only reasonable thing:
I pack the new front  bearings, install the seals, mount the rotors,
put the wheels back on, load the other parts into the front seat and
con a friend into helping me push the car the mile or so to the other
shop.

Great, I'm a lot sweatier than I'd expected, but getting really close
to finishing... I move cars around to get the space I need, From porschephiles-request@tta.com  Thu Nov  3 11:37:08 1994

to the rear seals. About this time (well over 10 days from the start of
this project) I hear from Robert Albrecht who is changing the rear wheel
bearings his car, and notes that the spec for the 36mm nut is 400 ft-lbs
and that can't be right. I assure him that it is, wish him luck and 
congratulate myself for not having that problem. Until about a hour later
when it hits me that I *DO* have that exact problem. OK, I'll just borrow
the Ingersall-Rand heavy-duty double-hammer impact.... except I'm doing
this in my race-car storage warehouse, not the real racing shop, so I
don't have air.

What to do... I try the 5 foot cheater bar approach. I try heat. Nope,
this is definitely going to take air. So I do the only reasonable thing:
I pack the new front  bearings, install the seals, mount the rotors,
put the wheels back on, load the other parts into the front seat and
con a friend into helping me push the car the mile or so to the other
shop.

Great, I'm a lot sweatier than I'd expected, but getting really close
to finishing... I move cars around to get the space I need, then away
we go. Literally. I had to take care of some "real" business and let
Elmer Fohey handle the rest of the brakes. Since he is the only professional
to work on this car since about 1970, that's a reasonable approach.

Off I go, and I figure Elmer will have this beat in no time at all.
Well, remember that light at the end of the tunnel? It really wasn't a
train, it was a UPS truck. I'd broken one of the metal brake lines. And
I'd forgotten about needing new emergency brake shoes. Hello, Zims?
And then the rear seal kit wasn't quite right... Ummm, Zims? Hope you
haven't shipped that yet...

Oh, the calipers I tossed in that box to be rebuilt? Well, the
fronts were no problem -- split them, pop the pistons, clean everything
up, re-paint, re-seal, and they're done. The rears, though... Remember
how I said the pistons didn't retract? Well, they didn't come out, either.
At least most of them didn't. One just popped out, another eventually came out
with a little coaxing and some ZEP-45. The other two, well, they came out
in pieces... Had to grab them with Vise-Grips, and pull and pull to get
enough exposed to grab in the bench vise, which let me brace with my 
feet while I *REALLY* pulled. So I needed a couple of pistons, which 
meant back to Stoddard and the UPS truck...

Anyway, Elmer gets all this stuff back together, and it's time to bleed the 
brakes!!! Yeah!!! I go scare up a couple of quarts of Castrol LMA,
get the Eezibleed, and prepare to be driving in half an hour or so. 

I'd never used the Eezibleed before, but the nice folks that sell it
sent me one to evaluate late last year. The instructions were very
detailed, and with a very superior air, I started explaining to Elmer
how much better this was to the vaccuum bleeders we'd previously used
and discarded. He was skeptical. I bled the spare down to 25 psi,
filled the bottle with brake fluid, and told him to get ready to
start bleeding while I hooked everything up. About that time, the
interior of the trunk is filled with a fine mist of brake fluid. Seems
that the lid isn't sealed too well. Must be age or deformity in the
30 year old reservoir -- no problem, I'll just clean up and hit it with
some Teflon tape and it will seal. Sure enough -- it sealed. And the
Eezibleed worked *GREAT* -- for about 3 minutes, until the reservoir
exploded. Seems that despite their expertise in making cars, beer,
and war, the Germans can't make plastic for shit. That, plus thirty 
years of aging in the finest possible environment, meant the reservoir
was NOT up to getting hit with 25 psi. That slow suction from the master 
cylinder was more like it.

Holy smokes, new reservoirs are hard to find. Eventually got a good
used one locally, and decided this time to do it the hard way. Since
my idea didn't pan out, I got to pump. Any idea how long it takes to
pump a quart and a half of brake fluid given a 17mm bore and about a
two inch stroke?? Yeah. Neither did I...

After about three hours, including replacing a couple of the soft 
copper sealing washers that weren't and a bleeder screw or two that didn't,
it was done. So, my simple going-to-be-done-tomorrow brake job took 15 days, 
about $1100 dollars in parts and labor, and wound up with me replacing
the entire brake system except for two metal lines and the little rubber
pad on the pedal. Not to mention various other sterring parts, and some
of the throttle linkage.

The Eezibleed experiment *WAS* a success, though. It's now part of the
reuglar race gear. But if you use one on your older car -- watch out
for problems with the reservoir or line to the master cylinder as
it may not be up to the added pressure, and mind the seal at the 
reservoir cap.

I'd like to acknowledge the help I got from the various other people
I talked to or bought stuff from -- Brad at United German, the whole crew 
at Zims and Stoddard, Brad Ripley at NLA,  Elmer Fohey, Peter and Robert
Albrecht (no relation), Foreign Intrigue, and the nice folks at Eezibleed.
Plus, the engineers at Porsche who made such a fine car that you really
can do the service work on yourself, even if they did plan on you doing
it a little more frequently than once every thirty years. And finally, my 
Snap-On salesman and his son, who I must be putting through college all

Chris,
The timing and balance belts should be changed every 60,000 miles or less
(never more or you may end up with an expensive replacement of bent valves).
 I also replace the tensioners and pulleys at the same time.
Also, have the front oil seals checked while you're replacing the belts.  I
had the belts replaced on schedule and had them replaced  again 22,000 miles
later when I had a new water pump installed.  Less than 10,000 miles later I
started having balance belt problems (vibrations at 2,800 rpms and up, more
noise).
When we took off the cover, the balance belt was nearly jelly with no teeth
left due to leaking oil, a tensioner was whining like a siren, and the timing
belt was also getting covered with oil.  (Thank God, we caught it before the
timing belt malfunctioned -- that's when it gets real expensive!).
What happened was the dealer didn't replace the tensioners or the oil seals
for the shafts when the water pump and the belts were replaced because the
job was already prohibitively expensive.  Unfortunately, it ended up costing
me more to have the full job done again (although the dealer did pick up a
lot of the labor costs).
So, if you need to replace a water pump, replace the belts, since you'll be
down there, anyway.
Better to replace the belts more, rather than less, frequently, but never
more than 60,000 -- and then have them readjusted at 2,000 miles (the engine
must be stone cold to adjust them properly).
I will admit I'm not religious about the 12,000 mile adjustment checks, but,
quite frankly, if you know your car, you can usually tell when they are
getting noisy or cranky.

It is quite simple;
1: you go into a sharp turn with plenty speed
2: let accelerator fully out(up? No throtthle!) Weight transfers forwards.
3: depress clutch and grab handbrake lever
4: as your behind suddenly become your front, release handbrake and clutch 
and give full throtthle forward

Basically you make a 180 degree turn with very little effort.

We use it all th time when driving in snow and on icy roads. In deep snow it 
is essential to get the Beetle steering *your* way. Everyone that has driven 
a Beetle (or similar concept) wintertime should have tried this. The 
pressure on the front wheels are so low that they merely slide through the 
snow. If you're driving Beetle wintertime, a good rule is to keep full tank 
and 50 kilo's worth of sand in the luggage compartment.

This method is *very* competitive if you drive a F(ront)WD car unless, you 
drive a SAAB, then you're in for a few surprises....

Hi, Tom...

Well, if you are talking about the Catalytic Converter, it is one piece that
goes from the exhaust headers to the muffler, and yes, that is one piece.

If you are fairly handy, and have a couple of 13 mm wrenches, you should be
able to remove the catalyst yourself and take it to a (non-automotive)
welding shop and ask them to weld the crack.  That is, no doubt, the
cheapest alternative.

(BTW, the reason the mechanic won't touch it is that it is against Federal
(!!) law for him to modify it in any way.)

As far as HP increases, there used to be "test pipes" that were available,
but they mostly turned out to be "cashflow devices" and did not improve
performance.  At least, that's what I recall from the thread here...

If you decide that you want to buy a used catalyst, give me a call and we
can discuss...

Hi, George, 

I'm afraid that I have to disagree with your statement.

60000 miles is WAY too long an interval.

My belt destructed at 45K.

I now do it every 15K, but I'm a fanatic (and extremely cheap)...
30K is the more common replacement interval, with 10K tension checks, after
the initial 1500 mile check after replacement.

Belts are cheap compared to valves.

It's a maintenance item.  Think of it as once every 5 oil changes.

If you lean out the mixture enough, you'll probably get an inspection sticker
without the catalytic converter, but it *is* illegal, as far as I know,
to remove it (at least in Massachusetts); if the inspector looks under 
there and sees the pipe he may give you a hard time.

It is possible that the better viscosity index of the synthetic is helping
here. The synthetic is probably thicker at operating temperature than the
dinosaur stuff, hence less likely to slop around into (and away from)

less foam.

'75 911 with 3.0 engine for $25K - Hah! The basic rule is that anything

car is like new, and the 3.0 has been rebuilt, it should still be worth 
less than a '78-83 911SC that has never had it's engine swapped. A

_____> Not necessarily.  The car COULD be a Carrera3.0 ;)

Actually motor upgrades to replace a 2.7 increase value.  I was abl;e

You are correct.  75s are worth significanly less for the following
reasons:

Rustproofing was either non-existant or highly suspicious.  I beleive
galvanization started in '76 but many '76 cars are feirce rusters.  It
seems '77s are OK but I wouldn't settle for less than an SC, if only
for the power wiondows and factory flares.

Prices vary ALOT.  I have a freind who just bought a reasonable Euro SC
for 9K, $79.  I would rather have that (as a trackee) than a US model
because of lack of AC, higher compression and bigger ports.

I am prepping my 89 951 track car for next years season. 
I have heard from some "experts" that wheel bearings, specifically on the
front, should be replaced as routine maintenance. I am not sure I agree since
I have never had a bearing fail. I do routinely inspect the outers and they
get re packed on a regular basis. The rollers and the races look fine with no
scoring or galling, and of course they are carefully adjusted before each
event.
Do these items just fail? I have no problem replacing them since the expense
is not great. It just seems like an inspection and re packing with new seals
is sufficient.
Any input?

I think that many show it in the tail first (my theory is that when you 
head into your garage, sun comes in thru garage door window and fades rear.

This, being only oxydation in the surface layer paint, usually can be
polished out with a mild abrassive polish if it's not too far gone.  Even
then, mild rubbing compound will often do the trick.  Talk to a *Paint*
shop before you commit yourself.

These manifolds are too small for your 3.0L to breath thru (makes sense,
doesn't it? being designed for a 2.0L?).  Although the machine work *can* be
done to make these manifolds work, it is not  a straight-forward job.  I'd

Just a comment on this having done a 3.2L upgrade and talking to some other
competitors that have had the same experience.  We compression and leak-down
checked my motor ('88 w/ 24K miles) and found 2 cyls that had in the 15%
leakage range.  Before tearing the motor down we went ahead and did the dyno
work and then re-checked  the leakdown.  Low and behold, everybody was
talking 4% ]]  After talking to others that had installed 3.2l motors *that
had been sitting for a time* it seems that what we experienced was pretty
common.  Our theory was that carbon had flaked off of a valve and lodged
between it and the seat and was just barely holding the valve open --
running the motor cleared it up...

we go. Literally. I had to take care of some "real" business and let
Elmer Fohey handle the rest of the brakes. Since he is the only professional
to work on this car since about 1970, that's a reasonable approach.

Off I go, and I figure Elmer will have this beat in no time at all.
Well, remember that light at the end of the tunnel? It really wasn't a
train, it was a UPS truck. I'd broken one of the metal brake lines. And
I'd forgotten about needing new emergency brake shoes. Hello, Zims?
And then the rear seal kit wasn't quite right... Ummm, Zims? Hope you
haven't shipped that yet...

Oh, the calipers I tossed in that box to be rebuilt? Well, the
fronts were no problem -- split them, pop the pistons, clean everything
up, re-paint, re-seal, and they're done. The rears, though... Remember
how I said the pistons didn't retract? Well, they didn't come out, either.
At least most of them didn't. One just popped out, another eventually came out
with a little coaxing and some ZEP-45. The other two, well, they came out
in pieces... Had to grab them with Vise-Grips, and pull and pull to get
enough exposed to grab in the bench vise, which let me brace with my 
feet while I *REALLY* pulled. So I needed a couple of pistons, which 
meant back to Stoddard and the UPS truck...

Anyway, Elmer gets all this stuff back together, and it's time to bleed the 
brakes!!! Yeah!!! I go scare up a couple of quarts of Castrol LMA,
get the Eezibleed, and prepare to be driving in half an hour or so. 

I'd never used the Eezibleed before, but the nice folks that sell it
sent me one to evaluate late last year. The instructions were very
detailed, and with a very superior air, I started explaining to Elmer
how much better this was to the vaccuum bleeders we'd previously used
and discarded. He was skeptical. I bled the spare down to 25 psi,
filled the bottle with brake fluid, and told him to get ready to
start bleeding while I hooked everything up. About that time, the
interior of the trunk is filled with a fine mist of brake fluid. Seems
that the lid isn't sealed too well. Must be age or deformity in the
30 year old reservoir -- no problem, I'll just clean up and hit it with
some Teflon tape and it will seal. Sure enough -- it sealed. And the
Eezibleed worked *GREAT* -- for about 3 minutes, until the reservoir
exploded. Seems that despite their expertise in making cars, beer,
and war, the Germans can't make plastic for shit. That, plus thirty 
years of aging in the finest possible environment, meant the reservoir
was NOT up to getting hit with 25 psi. That slow suction from the master 
cylinder was more like it.

Holy smokes, new reservoirs are hard to find. Eventually got a good
used one locally, and decided this time to do it the hard way. Since
my idea didn't pan out, I got to pump. Any idea how long it takes to
pump a quart and a half of brake fluid given a 17mm bore and about a
two inch stroke?? Yeah. Neither did I...

After about three hours, including replacing a couple of the soft 
copper sealing washers that weren't and a bleeder screw or two that didn't,
it was done. So, my simple going-to-be-done-tomorrow brake job took 15 days, 
about $1100 dollars in parts and labor, and wound up with me replacing
the entire brake system except for two metal lines and the little rubber
pad on the pedal. Not to mention various other sterring parts, and some
of the throttle linkage.

The Eezibleed experiment *WAS* a success, though. It's now part of the
reuglar race gear. But if you use one on your older car -- watch out
for problems with the reservoir or line to the master cylinder as
it may not be up to the added pressure, and mind the seal at the 
reservoir cap.

I'd like to acknowledge the help I got from the various other people
I talked to or bought stuff from -- Brad at United German, the whole crew 
at Zims and Stoddard, Brad Ripley at NLA,  Elmer Fohey, Peter and Robert
Albrecht (no relation), Foreign Intrigue, and the nice folks at Eezibleed.
Plus, the engineers at Porsche who made such a fine car that you really
can do the service work on yourself, even if they did plan on you doing
it a little more frequently than once every thirty years. And finally, my 
Snap-On salesman and his son, who I must be putting through college all 
by myself, from the look of things.

Chris,
The timing and balance belts should be changed every 60,000 miles or less
(never more or you may end up with an expensive replacement of bent valves).
 I also replace the tensioners and pulleys at the same time.
Also, have the front oil seals checked while you're replacing the belts.  I
had the belts replaced on schedule and had them replaced  again 22,000 miles
later when I had a new water pump installed.  Less than 10,000 miles later I
started having balance belt problems (vibrations at 2,800 rpms and up, more
noise).
When we took off the cover, the balance belt was nearly jelly with no teeth
left due to leaking oil, a tensioner was whining like a siren, and the timing
belt was also getting covered with oil.  (Thank God, we caught it before the
timing belt malfunctioned -- that's when it gets real expensive!).
What happened was the dealer didn't replace the tensioners or the oil seals
for the shafts when the water pump and the belts were replaced because the
job was already prohibitively expensive.  Unfortunately, it ended up costing
me more to have the full job done again (although the dealer did pick up a
lot of the labor costs).
So, if you need to replace a water pump, replace the belts, since you'll be
down there, anyway.
Better to replace the belts more, rather than less, frequently, but never
more than 60,000 -- and then have them readjusted at 2,000 miles (the engine
must be stone cold to adjust them properly).
I will admit I'm not religious about the 12,000 mile adjustment checks, but,
quite frankly, if you know your car, you can usually tell when they are
getting noisy or cranky.

It is quite simple;
1: you go into a sharp turn with plenty speed
2: let accelerator fully out(up? No throtthle!) Weight transfers forwards.
3: depress clutch and grab handbrake lever
4: as your behind suddenly become your front, release handbrake and clutch 
and give full throtthle forward

Basically you make a 180 degree turn with very little effort.

We use it all th time when driving in snow and on icy roads. In deep snow it 
is essential to get the Beetle steering *your* way. Everyone that has driven 
a Beetle (or similar concept) wintertime should have tried this. The 
pressure on the front wheels are so low that they merely slide through the 
snow. If you're driving Beetle wintertime, a good rule is to keep full tank 
and 50 kilo's worth of sand in the luggage compartment.

This method is *very* competitive if you drive a F(ront)WD car unless, you 
drive a SAAB, then you're in for a few surprises....

Trond

Hi, Tom...

Well, if you are talking about the Catalytic Converter, it is one piece that
goes from the exhaust headers to the muffler, and yes, that is one piece.

If you are fairly handy, and have a couple of 13 mm wrenches, you should be
able to remove the catalyst yourself and take it to a (non-automotive)
welding shop and ask them to weld the crack.  That is, no doubt, the
cheapest alternative.

(BTW, the reason the mechanic won't touch it is that it is against Federal
(!!) law for him to modify it in any way.)

As far as HP increases, there used to be "test pipes" that were available,
but they mostly turned out to be "cashflow devices" and did not improve
performance.  At least, that's what I recall from the thread here...

If you decide that you want to buy a used catalyst, give me a call and we
can discuss...

Hi, George, 

I'm afraid that I have to disagree with your statement.

60000 miles is WAY too long an interval.

My belt destructed at 45K.

I now do it every 15K, but I'm a fanatic (and extremely cheap)...
30K is the more common replacement interval, with 10K tension checks, after
the initial 1500 mile check after replacement.

Belts are cheap compared to valves.

It's a maintenance item.  Think of it as once every 5 oil changes.

If you lean out the mixture enough, you'll probably get an inspection sticker
without the catalytic converter, but it *is* illegal, as far as I know,
to remove it (at least in Massachusetts); if the inspector looks under 
there and sees the pipe he may give you a hard time.

It is possible that the better viscosity index of the synthetic is helping
here. The synthetic is probably thicker at operating temperature than the
dinosaur stuff, hence less likely to slop around into (and away from)
various places under violent maneuvering. Also, less surf should mean
less foam.

'75 911 with 3.0 engine for $25K - Hah! The basic rule is that anything 
non-original makes value go down, unless it improves something over 
original. '74-'77 911's had engines that were inferior to the ones before 
and after in terms of longevity. A used 3.0 is a good, common swap. If the 
car is like new, and the 3.0 has been rebuilt, it should still be worth 
less than a '78-83 911SC that has never had it's engine swapped. A 
documented '78 SC with say 100K miles and a rebuilt engine would probably 
go for $10K and be a superior car. Run away. Invest the money into 30 year

_____> Not necessarily.  The car COULD be a Carrera3.0 ;)

Actually motor upgrades to replace a 2.7 increase value.  I was abl;e
to get almost $10K for my 76 -w- SC flares.

You are correct.  75s are worth significanly less for the following
reasons:

Rustproofing was either non-existant or highly suspicious.  I beleive
galvanization started in '76 but many '76 cars are feirce rusters.  It
seems '77s are OK but I wouldn't settle for less than an SC, if only
for the power wiondows and factory flares.

Prices vary ALOT.  I have a freind who just bought a reasonable Euro SC
for 9K, $79.  I would rather have that (as a trackee) than a US model
because of lack of AC, higher compression and bigger ports.

Need some net wisdom:
I am prepping my 89 951 track car for next years season. 
I have heard from some "experts" that wheel bearings, specifically on the
front, should be replaced as routine maintenance. I am not sure I agree since
I have never had a bearing fail. I do routinely inspect the outers and they
get re packed on a regular basis. The rollers and the races look fine with no
scoring or galling, and of course they are carefully adjusted before each
event.
Do these items just fail? I have no problem replacing them since the expense
is not great. It just seems like an inspection and re packing with new seals
is sufficient.
Any input?

---dbrake turn instructions

1) Find vehicle with 4 wheels, and low center of gravity. Monster trucks 
are no good. Stability is important.
2) Check registration of vehicle. Ensure that it does not belong to you.
3) Wait for a day with precipitation. Makes everything go smoother. 
Traction is NOT your friend.
4) Find a nice open area. Parking lots are good, but ensure that it does 
not have those concrete logs that denote parking spaces laying around. The 
site of your last auto-x probably is best. Do not do this when people or 
other cars are around. Do not do what I did and practice this in the mall 
parking lot while waiting for the oil change guy to come for the car. 
Security will arrive quickly.
5) Move forward at about 20 mph. This manuver can be done much faster with 
more experience/guts.
6) This is the fun part. Jack the steering wheel hard in either direction 
for rotational momentum. Instantly, hit the clutch to isolate your 
drivetrain and with your thumb on the handbrake release, yank it back hard 
and hold it, locking the rears which will then break loose, creating an 
oversteer situation.
7) Your car will quickly rotate 180 degrees using much less space than you 
were permitted in the broken U-turn portion of your driving test.
8) You are now traveling backwards at 20mph. Time to rectify the situation. 
Drop the handbrake and release (thumb was still there, wasn't it), pop the 
clutch and hit the gas.
9) Do this two more times and drive to your mechanic for the $25 parking 
brake adjustment.

In my younger days, I got good enough at this maneuver, that as I passed a 
parked patrol car at an excessive rate of speed, I was able to get to one 
of those "This is not a U-turn" median cutouts, handbrake turn on the 
shoulder, zip through the median, and proceed to the next exit, thus 
avoiding possible fines/loss of driving privileges. When you get better, 
you can actually be turning in the median cutout, with the turn completing 
on the other side of the median. Saves those precious seconds. Note that I 
have never attempted this in a German car.

For real laughs, try this with a spacesaver spare as one of the rear tires.

The above was of course purely hypothetical and was performed by trained, 
experienced drivers in a controlled situation.

guess  we've given you a ration about killing mosquitos with your
oil injection.  Well, I was kind of nursing one more event out of
my  008s.   I  had   about a thumbnail sized bit  of  steel  belt
showing on one rear tire when I started.  By the end of the first
practice  session,  it  was significantly worse.   I  could  FEEL
pulsating  grip in right turns due steel not sticking to  asphalt
very  well.   The  second practice runs, I took it  easy  in  the
corners, worked on line, and only took 3 laps.  For timed runs, I
skipped the warmup. I figured one decent run would win the class.
the  starter noticed the tires starting the second run (the  left
one  now has steel all the way around, the RR in splotches).   He
let me run.  I got out and checked at the end, and parked it.

     Sounds  unsafe,  doesn't  it?   Well, It's  a  wide,  smooth
parking  lot  with  nothing  to hit but  cones  (given  a  LITTLE
discretion).  I felt I was not risking blowout because it was the
belt  edge that was showing, and I did take it a little easy.   I
wouldn't  have done this on a road course, or with hard barriers,
and  seeing how fast the rubber came off once it started, I won't
do  it  again.  Anyway, I won (since the main competition  wasn't

There's been some excellent posts about upgrading exhausts on 3.0l and up
motors recently.  One article I remember on the chips/exhaust subject was
the one that Bruce Anderson wrote for the Oct. '91 Excellence.  After much
dyno testing of chips and exhaust combos on a stock 3.2, Bruce said
something like: the best chip you can buy for your 3.2 is a free flow
exhaust] (not his exact words...).  I think Scott Winders mentioned opening
up the exhaust in the thread on mass flow sensors versus  the stock Motronic
flapper setup as well.

I did some playing around on our '84 Carrera and found that SSI dual exhaust
with a free-flow muffler and a disconnected O2 sensor was about as good as
it would get (Motronic fails to rich setting when it loses the O2 sensor =
quicker throttle response).  I wouldn't believe *ANY* of the claims the
chip-makers have about huge HP gains by just changing the cpu out.  You may
get a front loaded advance curve and a higher rev limiter -- the advance
giving quicker throttle response which "feels" like more HP, but there ain't
no magic, you still have to get more fuel&air in and out to make more power.
 BTW: I know of at least two AutoAuthority chipped 3.2s that burned up --
too much advance was the suspected cause...

A shameless plug for a freeflow muffler I am using is the one built by Kurt
Pressler on the left coast.  Kurt re-baffles a stock 911 muffler and it
really flows well without being much louder than stock -- Our dyno testing
showed it to produce a very smooth torque curve that came on strong at low
rpm, we had good peak power as well.  I understand Kurt has back-to-back
tested against factory megaphones and sport mufflers with identical peak HP
numbers as the sport muffler but a much stronger and smoother torque curve.
 I'm happy with mine (and the car wins).  Anyway if you call Kurt, tell him
I sent you.  His number is 510-684-9437.

Oh one last thing, to the folks that are busy advancing their cam timing --
be careful on your shifts, the motor will be less forgiving of a mechanical
over-rev if you miss an upshift and it becomes a downshift (valves hitting
pistons = not good), I know of a *bunch* of motors that have died this
way...

The best oil I've ever used (15 yrs) is Spectro Golden Motor Guard.

It's a mineral based synthetic blend.  Available in 5W40 for cold weather,
10W50 and 20W50.  The stuff has great detergent capability and low
friction.

It's available at most motorcycle stores.

I've been shopping around (locally) for an '87-'89 911 Cab for the past
couple of months. I really wanted a Guards Red 911, but after looking at
several, I've changed my mind about the color. It seems that they had
all (to varying degrees) faded to a burnt orange color, especially the
rear deck lid (no tail).

Is this fading normal for Guards Red 911s?

OBTW, did I mention that I live in south FL?  Oh...now you tell us! :-)

But, only a couple of the cars were local 

	One from Iowa, believe it or not! It WAS dusty as hell!
    One from SC.
	One from NJ.
	...

Well... you get the point. It this common for CA cars?

Currently, I'm looking for white. No color to fade to.

I think that many show it in the tail first (my theory is that when you 
head into your garage, sun comes in thru garage door window and fades rear.

This, being only oxydation in the surface layer paint, usually can be
polished out with a mild abrassive polish if it's not too far gone.  Even
then, mild rubbing compound will often do the trick.  Talk to a *Paint*
shop before you commit yourself.

> Well... you get the point. It this common for CA cars?

Common to cars exposed to intense sun.

These manifolds are too small for your 3.0L to breath thru (makes sense,
doesn't it? being designed for a 2.0L?).  Although the machine work *can* be
done to make these manifolds work, it is not  a straight-forward job.  I'd
recommend you just buy the right manifolds from PMO -- unless, of course,
you are an expert in compound-angle boring....

The 40s will give you fine throttle response and also good top-end........

Just a comment on this having done a 3.2L upgrade and talking to some other
competitors that have had the same experience.  We compression and leak-down
checked my motor ('88 w/ 24K miles) and found 2 cyls that had in the 15%
leakage range.  Before tearing the motor down we went ahead and did the dyno
work and then re-checked  the leakdown.  Low and behold, everybody was
talking 4% ]]  After talking to others that had installed 3.2l motors *that
had been sitting for a time* it seems that what we experienced was pretty
common.  Our theory was that carbon had flaked off of a valve and lodged
between it and the seat and was just barely holding the valve open --
running the motor cleared it up...

Subject: Replacing Brake Bleed Nipple on 911.

I partially stripped a brake bleed nipple on my 911 recently.  Next time
I bleed the brakes I intend to replace the partially stripped nipple.

Is there anything special I have to do.  Is it just a case of unscrewing the 
old nipple and screwing in a new one prior to bleeding the brakes.

1)  Do I need sealing compound/washers before screwing in the new nipple ?

2)  Will this have to be a Porsche part ?  Can anyone tell me the specs.
so that I can check if it is a standard part ?


Also, while I am on the subject, at my last Drivers Ed event, during the
inspection the inspector complained that my brake fluid was dirty.  Since
I had bled the system only a few months prior to the event I knew the
fluid was good.  The problem seems to be that the plastic reservoir is
quite cloudy and without removing the top and looking at the fluid it makes
it look like the fluid is dirty.  Should I think about replacing the
reservoir, or does anyone else (like me) think that this inspector was
being overly picky.  It's not like it's that tough to remove the cap and
look at the fluid in the reservoir to see if it looks OK.

Opinions ?

************************
dbrake turn instructions

1) Find vehicle with 4 wheels, and low center of gravity. Monster trucks 
are no good. Stability is important.
2) Check registration of vehicle. Ensure that it does not belong to you.
3) Wait for a day with precipitation. Makes everything go smoother. 
Traction is NOT your friend.
4) Find a nice open area. Parking lots are good, but ensure that it does 
not have those concrete logs that denote parking spaces laying around. The 
site of your last auto-x probably is best. Do not do this when people or 
other cars are around. Do not do what I did and practice this in the mall 
parking lot while waiting for the oil change guy to come for the car. 
Security will arrive quickly.
5) Move forward at about 20 mph. This manuver can be done much faster with 
more experience/guts.
6) This is the fun part. Jack the steering wheel hard in either direction 
for rotational momentum. Instantly, hit the clutch to isolate your 
drivetrain and with your thumb on the handbrake release, yank it back hard 
and hold it, locking the rears which will then break loose, creating an 
oversteer situation.
7) Your car will quickly rotate 180 degrees using much less space than you 
were permitted in the broken U-turn portion of your driving test.
8) You are now traveling backwards at 20mph. Time to rectify the situation. 
Drop the handbrake and release (thumb was still there, wasn't it), pop the 
clutch and hit the gas.
9) Do this two more times and drive to your mechanic for the $25 parking 
brake adjustment.

In my younger days, I got good enough at this maneuver, that as I passed a 
parked patrol car at an excessive rate of speed, I was able to get to one 
of those "This is not a U-turn" median cutouts, handbrake turn on the 
shoulder, zip through the median, and proceed to the next exit, thus 
avoiding possible fines/loss of driving privileges. When you get better, 
you can actually be turning in the median cutout, with the turn completing 
on the other side of the median. Saves those precious seconds. Note that I 
have never attempted this in a German car.

For real laughs, try this with a spacesaver spare as one of the rear tires.

The above was of course purely hypothetical and was performed by trained, 
experienced drivers in a controlled situation.

Bill,

     You  have to ask embarassing questions, don't you.  Well,  I
guess  we've given you a ration about killing mosquitos with your
oil injection.  Well, I was kind of nursing one more event out of
my  008s.   I  had   about a thumbnail sized bit  of  steel  belt
showing on one rear tire when I started.  By the end of the first
practice  session,  it  was significantly worse.   I  could  FEEL
pulsating  grip in right turns due steel not sticking to  asphalt
very  well.   The  second practice runs, I took it  easy  in  the
corners, worked on line, and only took 3 laps.  For timed runs, I
skipped the warmup. I figured one decent run would win the class.
the  starter noticed the tires starting the second run (the  left
one  now has steel all the way around, the RR in splotches).   He
let me run.  I got out and checked at the end, and parked it.

     Sounds  unsafe,  doesn't  it?   Well, It's  a  wide,  smooth
parking  lot  with  nothing  to hit but  cones  (given  a  LITTLE
discretion).  I felt I was not risking blowout because it was the
belt  edge that was showing, and I did take it a little easy.   I
wouldn't  have done this on a road course, or with hard barriers,
and  seeing how fast the rubber came off once it started, I won't
do  it  again.  Anyway, I won (since the main competition  wasn't
there), and now have fresh rubber.

     On  the  size vs. points thing, ask the autoX  chairman,  or
Paul  Young,  of Bob Lemke, who both have 928s.  They  don't  run
them at autoXs anymore, but probably know how the rules apply.

There's been some excellent posts about upgrading exhausts on 3.0l and up
motors recently.  One article I remember on the chips/exhaust subject was
the one that Bruce Anderson wrote for the Oct. '91 Excellence.  After much
dyno testing of chips and exhaust combos on a stock 3.2, Bruce said
something like: the best chip you can buy for your 3.2 is a free flow
exhaust] (not his exact words...).  I think Scott Winders mentioned opening
up the exhaust in the thread on mass flow sensors versus  the stock Motronic
flapper setup as well.

I did some playing around on our '84 Carrera and found that SSI dual exhaust
with a free-flow muffler and a disconnected O2 sensor was about as good as
it would get (Motronic fails to rich setting when it loses the O2 sensor =
quicker throttle response).  I wouldn't believe *ANY* of the claims the
chip-makers have about huge HP gains by just changing the cpu out.  You may
get a front loaded advance curve and a higher rev limiter -- the advance
giving quicker throttle response which "feels" like more HP, but there ain't
no magic, you still have to get more fuel&air in and out to make more power.
 BTW: I know of at least two AutoAuthority chipped 3.2s that burned up --
too much advance was the suspected cause...

A shameless plug for a freeflow muffler I am using is the one built by Kurt
Pressler on the left coast.  Kurt re-baffles a stock 911 muffler and it
really flows well without being much louder than stock -- Our dyno testing
showed it to produce a very smooth torque curve that came on strong at low
rpm, we had good peak power as well.  I understand Kurt has back-to-back
tested against factory megaphones and sport mufflers with identical peak HP
numbers as the sport muffler but a much stronger and smoother torque curve.
 I'm happy with mine (and the car wins).  Anyway if you call Kurt, tell him
I sent you.  His number is 510-684-9437.

Oh one last thing, to the folks that are busy advancing their cam timing --
be careful on your shifts, the motor will be less forgiving of a mechanical
over-rev if you miss an upshift and it becomes a downshift (valves hitting
pistons = not good), I know of a *bunch* of motors that have died this
way...

Hi,
 A couple of days ago somebody asked how to repair a bouncing tach. My tach
also bounces after shifting gears. Since I haven't heard anything about it,
can someone please tell me how to fix it. 
Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Does anybody have the lense for the fasten seat belt sign for a '73 911? The
early signs don't have the break warning lights, just fasten seatbelt.  The
assembly is in the dash, but the lense is missing in my car. If anybody has
the lense or the assembly and is willing to part with it inexpensively,
please E-mail. 
Thanks,

Subject: RE:  928: No hot start


I am currently having a similar problem which a Porsche dealer is 
"attempting" to fix.  The car runs really strong and normal for about 10-15 
miles then stalls like it ran out of gas.  Attempts to re-start it result in 
a sputter like it's trying to start, but it doesn't have the gas to do it.

When it first died, after about 15 miles on the interstate I had it towed 
in.  The dealer replaced the fuel pump, fuel filter and pump relay for 
nearly $700!  I picked up the car, drove 10 miles and it died again, exactly 
as before.  I called them right up gave them some hell, demanded they come 
tow it in and put my old pump back in and find the real problem.

Yesterday he calls me and advised he thinks the fuel pressure regulators are 
bad, claims there's rust in them.  He also theorizes this "rust" made the 
fuel pump die.  As I thought about this, it became obvious that he has not 
replaced my pump as I requested and is trying to justify it.

The fuel tank and cap are plastic, the fuel filter is changed every 10,000 
miles (every spring), I buy the same gas at the same station for my three 
cars for the past 5 years (250,000 miles) and none of them have had any rust 
problem.  I checked the clear fuel filters in my other two cars last night 
and there is no hint of rust in them, so I believe my gas supply is OK.  I 
must wonder how "rust" got in and damaged the fuel pump.

If the car was not so far from my regular dealer, I would have it towed 
there.  But it would cost approx.. $270 to do that.  I am very undecided on 
what to do next if these regulators are not the problem.  I have too much 
work to do on my house in preparation for son's birth to mess with the car 
myself.  Hopefully between the dealers management, Porsche, MasterCard, 
State & County Consumer Affairs office,  and a very welcome offer from Ron 
Zeigler to contact the dealer liaison at NNJR-PCA (thanks Ron!) I have some 
options should this get out of hand.

I received one good suggestion, open the gas cap next time is stalls and 
listen for a whoosh of air.  If the tank vent is plugged, a vacuum will 
develop and fight the fuel pump.  This should be an easy fix.  Dealer ruled 
this out on my car.

If this doesn't do it, my advice is to take it to a mechanic you trust and 
have him test everything (when the car refuses to start) before he starts 
replacing expensive parts one at a time.  Anyone can fix a car by replacing 
all it's parts, but this is not something I'm going to pay a Porsche trained 
mechanic $68+ / hour to do or expect from him.  Besides my Mom will do it 
less than half that!

Have the ignition system tested to make sure you have  a strong spark at the 
right time.  A friends ignition module went on his Bronco and he had similar 
problems.

Test the fuel pressure, but beware, low fuel pressure could be a defective 
pressure regulator or the fuel pump.  Both regulators go for $70, the pump 
is nearly $700 (dealer price).

When I get my car back I'll post a note on the net with my results.  Good 
luck, and post a note when you get her going again.

Hey Jim,

 Daaaa.... guess that would be the most "official" place too look.
My book shows them parked over that pass window. Even further research
in other books shows the same. From what I can tell it's untill 1968 that
they are parked that way. Or should I say, 1965, 1966, and (possibly)
1967. I see the 68's are on the drivers side. Unless were talking about
the British vehicles...;-)

I've also hear this called a "bootleg U-turn".  A girl I went out with

scirocco.

BTW - has anybody convert the Whale AVI to and MPG?  I downloaded it and
tried, but I'm missing a vital piece of software for the conversion
process - something called MS movie for windows or something.  The converter
I have takes a 24-bit avi stream from this program, rips it apart, and
re-assembles it as an MPG.  I have an MPG viewer, but not an AVI.  Hmmm.

Richard,

1)  I have heard of people using Locktite on these but I replaced all of 
mine two years ago (just screwed them in, no Locktite) and haven't had any 
problems.  Definitely no washers on a '74 911 bleed nipple...
2)  I did get mine through the dealer (had them in stock!) but I'm sure they 
are not the only source...

About the brake fluid...as long as you *know* that it has been changed 
within the time frame indicated by your region's tech form or, in my case, 
after each track event, then you shouldn't worry about it.  Good brakes are 
*everything*, keep it all fresh!  Good luck!

Nope, the emergency brake only locks up the rear wheels.  Stepping

If your dash trim is not currently hacked, I'd point out that the wood trim
is impossible to find.  My 911S had its dash chopped up to accept a pull out
stereo in the 23 years previous to when I bought it (also a 1966) and I've
been looking for a good set of wood trim for five years.

You can't hear the stereo most of the time anyway so why bother?

    jim rockford was right, but he was driving a light brown Firebird, not a 
Camaro. Just a small point. I always enjoyed those turns that he did. I think he 
actually did those stunts himself because he is a halfway decent driver as he 
was being trained for that other famous car racing movie with Steve McQuin (sp).

Yeah, I really do know they should be set @.10 mm. I just wasn't thinking

   you know, this is fun. i know of someone who used to race mini's in
   auto-x and a kind of obstacle course thing . the obstacles included
   such things as entering a two door house garage and exiting as quickly
   as you could. to be successful at this you had to enter quite fast to
   get enough speed to do a 180' hand-brake turn.
      this i have not tried(almost but my '77 civic was too big)but i
   have been daring enough to do a cop turn. this is much more af a thrill
   than the old hand-brake turn.it involves going fast backwards then
   suddenly cranking the wheel,press clutch jamm first and nail the gas.
    if you go fast enough in reverse,you can choose second!!
   this is fun and really tricky especially on narrow asphalt.

Subject: Coolant on the garage floor


Hello Phellow Philes;

Well, I think it has finally started.  I let my SO drive my '89 951 to work 
today while I took her '92 325I.  She left before me as usual.  When I went to 
get in her car I noticed a small puddle of coolant on the garage floor where my 
car used to be.  This is the first time ANY fluid has been observed coming from 
the car when it shouldn't be.  The Porsche Gods must have been mad at me for 
letting someone else drive the car.

Talk about bad timing!  I have two days of Driver's Ed scheduled for Nov. 12 and 
13 at Summit Point.  The question:  Is there a cause for coolant leakage other 
than a failing water pump or should I just have the water pump replaced now, 
before going to driver's ed?  Luckily the car is covered by the Porsche Used Car 
warranty which should cover this replacement.

On an unrelated subject, what is meant by HYPOID and NON-HYPOID differential 
oil.  I was looking to replace the differential oil but I could not find NON-
HYPOID gear oil called out in the owner's manual at PEP BOYS or TRACK AUTO.  I 
called two Porsche dealers and the service advisers could not tell me what the 
difference was.  What brands of diff oil can be used in the limited slip diff on 
my 951?

Thanks in advance for any responses.  I am getting a little nervous about the 
water pump situation.

And this exercise serves as a fine example of why the steering wheels
are at the front of a car.  When going in reverse, it only takes a
sharp steering input to spin the car (the "rear"-end steered wheels
throw the back end out) whereas when traveling forward it helps to
jerk on the parking brake (or lift off the throttle for you older 911
drivers :-).

All,

The next HSR (a historic racing body) event in the south is at Savannah, GA
(Roebling Road) on Nov 11, 12 and 13. One of the features of this race
weekend will be a 25th anniversary celebration of the 914 and 914/6, with a
special race just for 914's, a 914 concour and other features. Judging by the
number of 914's at the recent Road Atlanta event, this should be really good.
The Brumos 914/6 GT that Peter Gregg and Hurley Haywood used to win the first
IMSA championship will be entered.

Hope to see you there.

I find I cannot look at my 951 (also guards red) for five minutes straight
without it suddenly turning "orange" to my eyes, though there is no fading
in the paint.  Also at night the car looks "orange" under certain lighting
conditions.

My '86 Cab is also Guards Red aka Burnt Orange,
with one exception: the passenger door, which
was repainted around 1990. If you look carefully
(well, not THAT carefully) you notice it is a shade
or two redder than the rest of the car. You can
really see it under those orange flourescent
parking lot lights at night. I chalked it up
to a bad paint match (still do!), but the fact
that others note the color fade (if that's what
it is) is pretty interesting.

Stock tires were 185/70 x 15 on the front, 215/60 x 15 on the rear. This

They have been adjusted a small number of times, on an as-needed
basis.  No periodic adjustment per se.  I do a lot of track events
and we check them prior to each event.  The adjustment is a matter
of feel.  The manual describes being able to move a thrust washer

Well, winter seems to be coming to Las Vegas. Damn, I hate it when
it gets below 60 degrees. (Okay, okaay. 60's not too bad, but anything belo
below 50 is starting to get uncivilized)

This brings to mind the question I have. Lately, the '83 SC engine
in my '73 911T is rough on initial start after not being run for a
few hours (i.e. overnight, when I go home from work, etc.) It runs
quite roughly for 5 to 10 mins, with backfires if the throttle is 
breathed on (thank God for pop-off valves), after which it runs like
a champ. This seemed to come on worse with a drop in ambient temps,
but could also coincide with the mandated fall increase in gasoline
oxygenate for the Las Vegas area. My question is, what might cause
the rough warmup. Is the FI too lean and the cooler, denser air
exacerbating the problem? Is the oxygenated fuel contributing to the
problem? Might something else be causing this? If too lean, is this 
an adjustment I could easily do, or should I defer to the shop?
I

Tracy,

"Hypoid" describes the geometry of the ring and pinion gears.  As far
as lubricant of choice, I have used Mobil 1 synth for the last few
years, and am very happy with it.  It's a 75W90.  The folks in
California really like the Swepco product.  I tried it, and I found
(as did a number of friends) that it slows down the transmission
too much for us New Englanders.  By "slows down," I mean the shifting.

WRT coolant, I'd figure out what the problem is before throwing money
at the water pump.  At the risk of stating the obvious.

Subject: It works! It works!!

I finally got rid of that high pitched whining noise on the 1987 944S....As
a couple of you guessed it was the starter (thank goodness I didnd't run it
for very long).  What was causing it was a broken wire between the solenoid
and the main body of the starter .. that caused the solenoid to stick in an
engaged position once the ignition key had started it.  Fixed the wire, and
just started it and it works without any noise...it's still up in the
air....figure I'll tidy it up and bring it down tomorrow...Thanks for all
your help.

P.S.  A couple of observations on the clutch job.  Its the job from hell in
terms of time and getting to a couple of the bolts.  I truly think you can
do it in 2 days the first time and probably a full hard day the second if
you're well organized and have all the tools.  Get the FAQ of TTA.COM make
sure you have all the tools on hand (the 12 mm hex wasn't needed on my car
but it is on a friend's 88 to remove guess what, the starter).  Also, it
greatly helped that I raised the car and sprayed down stuff with liquid
wrench.  

Hmm...lemme see what else.  Couple of the bolts on the clutch bellhousing
that hold sensor's are more easily accessible from the top...I was kinda
lying across the engine compartment trying not to break anything expensive
while a friend guided the socket into place underneath...

Some tools that saved our lives several times were a flexible extension (I
think we bought the one from Wright tools...), the "wobbly"
extensions (Imparts)...also lucked out and found a good impact wrench at a pawn shop
for $65 (a snap-on)...that really helped on a couple of exhaust bolts.

Anyway, I'll quit rambling but a few people did ask for whatever
observations we had so...

If you stripped the threads on the bleed valve, you can get a new one
from Porsche.  If you stripped those in the calliper, you're looking
at a new calliper.  You could Time Sert it, but no mechanic in his/her
right mind would touch the job because of the liability.

No washer, no sealing or locking compound.  The bleeder seals at its
tip, not in the threads.  Any locking compound will not help, and will
only run the risk of polluting the fluid and blocking a line or

The really nice hotel in Stuttgart is the Graf Zeppelin, which to memory
is very close to the train station.  In '86, I stayed at a somewhat more
affordable hotel, the Ketterer, telephone number 711-294-151 (don't have

clean and friendly.  I think the room rate included a nice breakfast.
When you book, make sure you ask for a private bath if that's what you
want -- the rate will vary depending.

Stan,

I uploaded the movie "whale-movie" to the /pub/porschephiles/Images/Moving
directory on tta.com. This is a Macintosh Quicktime movie. I uploaded it
using Fetch 2.1.2 in MacBinary II format.

I converted it from the .avi format to Quicktime using the Microsoft Video
for Windows 1.1 AVI to QT Utility.

The upload averaged 300069 bytes per second.

This is a very funny movie!!

I haven't had this experience with Porsche engines, but I've checked 
compression in various American Iron engines, a Volvo some Alfa 4 & 6 
cylinder, all engines that had been stored around 6-10 years. 
I found this to be rather similar to most engines, the worst pieces are 
likely to be the Valve's (and seats) that has been in open position, often 
corroded. 
Another theori is that the piston rings 'freeze' in oil that 
('what_you_call_it'?) 'dries out'. 

I've even tried a few methods to 'help' engines that has been sitting around 
back to a normal life. 

The best method I found to be 'the Diesel' wash;

1) Empty old oil...(black sludge...)
2) Fill Diesel in place of engine oil.
3) Add a litre or two.
4) Thre possibilities; 1) crank the engine by hand for some minutes (pheew!) 
                            2) crank the engine with start motor for about a 
minute.
                            3) Fire up engine and run at 1500 rpm for about 
30-40 sec.

NB: both method 2 & 3 require that the engine is cranked by hand for at 
least 2 full revolutions first.(4-cycles), and method 1 & 2 gets much easier 
to do if you remove the plugs first.

NBII: I do *not* recommend this method for low mileage engines!

Hi,

I would like to know if anybody out there who has experience of
early '75-77 911 Turbos/930's.

Especially I would like to know if there are significant differences
in driveability,brutality and beauty between these older 3.0 930's
and the newer 3.2 930's? Do the early cars have any weaknesses that 
the newer ones don't have?

I know off course that the 3.0's have 'only' 260 hp and therefore should 
be a bit slower, but has anybody a subjective opinion about how big
the difference between 260 hp and 300 hp actually feels?

Finally how much should a 3.0 turbo cost in the US,do you think it would be 
possible to find a crash damaged example in the US or in Germany?

There is an interesting article on the roadgoing
Dauer 962 in the latest 911 and Porsche World.

The car featured is a nice subtle yellow, which goes
quite well with the `detuned' engine offering a mere
730 hp and 517 foot pounds of torque, giving adequate
performance of 0-62 in 2.6 seconds and 0-120 in something 
over 7.2 seconds. Top end is 251 mph, and even with some
of the downforce engineered out, it feels just right
at 180 mph on autobahn sweepers apparently. They also
point out that an acid yellow 962 has a magical effect
in clearing traffic from the outside lane.

Apparently, parking around town is a little difficult
without an assistant because it is over six feet wide, 
and there is no rear visibility. Oh yes, and it costs
1.5 million DM and there are 50 available.

Subject: oil pressure 911 sc w/ carrera tens

Hey all,

Since topping the 3L motor in my 82 SC, which included the Carerra
tensioner mods, I've noticed increased oil pressure.  At idle the
pressure is where it was before, down around 1 bar or so.  However
at moderate rpm's the pressure seems to be about 1 bar more than
it was previously.  In fact accellerating (not even very aggressivly)
the pressure will peg out at above 5 bar.  Is this something normal
with the tensioner mod, or should I be looking for something else
(like maybe another 911 ;-)) ?

It hasn't been run in a couple of years ?  It's sitting in a (damp?) garage ?
Was it "pickled" after it ran last time ?  StanScottBruce can tell you
what to look for specifically, but I'd be dubious of it being a good motor
now.  I'd at lest consider a borescope inspection (or just pull off the heads)
to check things out.

  >I'm thinking about buying Carrera tensioners since now seems like a good time

Piece of cake.  Install new ramps too, only a couple of bucks.  Make
sure you get a kit that has braces for the two new oil lines so
they don't flex and crack/fret.  You'll also need to snip a little bit
out of the sheet metal to clear the new RHS oil line.

Some are dead easy to do, some a a pain to reach.  I'd suggest picking
an exhaust valve, probably RHS, that you can see what you're doing the
first time because you'll have to do some (like at least three of the
intake valves) by Braille.  You'll have to jack the car up and remove
the rear wheel.  I'd suggest doing it  a side at a time, which means
turning the engine over more times but I think it's easier.

  >What's the easiest way to rotate the engine when moving from one valve to 
  >the next ?
Breaker bar between wheel lugs and rotate it.  If you jack up whole rear
and remove both wheels you'll need a breaker in the other side jammed
against the ground.  Remember to remove the plugs first !

  >Is this something I can do without a manual, I know they should be set 
  >stone cold @ 10mm.
err - I don't think you'll be happy with the way it runs if you set it
up with 10mm valve clearance ;->

  rIf anyone could give me some pointers I would appreciate it greatly.
Plan on oil escaping from the exhaust covers, esp RHS.

Buy (if you don't already have one) a stubby screw driver, inspection
light, ring spanner (13mm ?).  Do you have one of the valve adjuster
tools - you havn't much of a hope doing it with a regular feeler gauge
and staying sane.  I've had good luck buying "shim stock" from a local
factory supply house.  It's feeler gauge material in a "hacksaw blade"
format 12"x.5".  I use .003, .004 and .005 - just fold over about 1/2"
90 degrees at one end.  When it breaks off just fold over another 1/2"

Subject: Re: Synthetic Transmission Fluid


I put synthetic transmission fluid in the '71 911E (whose old, tired
901 transmission is due to be rebuilt this winter) and noticed a major
improvement. Fifth gear had a significant whine before, but after the
synthetic the whine was either greatly reduced or gone entirely. It's
odd, but the 5th gear whine is never the same twice after the
synthetic, but was uniformly ugly and loud before. I also think overall
transmission operation is improved but this effect is subtle in my
case.

Because synthetic oil reduces friction more effectively than organic
oil, I would think the transmission operating temperature would have to
be reduced as well... which can only help with the mechanical longevity
of the unit. Perhaps some of the p-file racers who have tramsmission
oil temperature gauges can comment on this.

Subject: speedometer readings



How accurate is the tachometer reading relative to the speedometer?
Is there the same potential error in the readings?  I want to be
able to watch the tach to figure out actual speed using gear ratio
calculations.  A friend of mine ran his '86 944 Turbo up to an
indicated 160mph last weekend, and were trying to figure what the
actual speed was.

The speedometer gets a square wave signal from the front passenger
side wheel, four pulses per wheel rotation.  For cars with ABS, the
ABS sensor is what sends the signal.  This square wave signal is
then changed by a transducer to output on an analog gage(mechanical). 
The speedometer can be calibrated by adjusting a potentiometer on the
back of the gage itself.  Where does the tachometer receive its signal
from, and is it less likely to have inherent error.

Subject: Re: Where do you purchase 914 parts?

Chris, actually there are lots of different places to get 914 parts 
depending on a number of different things.  

First, if you are looking for a local supply (i.e. drive to) try
any local VW place for engine, switch, and bearing parts.  
For engine parts (wires, plugs, coil, dist., gaskets, 
and some other) ask for parts for a 411/412 and you should get the right 
thing. Unfortunately this does not work for FI parts. 

Bearings and switches can also be tracked down using the part numbers in the 
AutoAtlanta catalog.  There are many, many, many ...... mail order places 
for 914 parts.  Some specialize (suspension, engine, sheet metal) but most 
carry a good selection, often with better prices that Mr. Hussey (esp. 
used).  I started a list, but it grew so quickly, I gave up.  I believe 
the 914 faq on tta.com has a good representation of available resources, 
but I have not seen any list that is exhaustive, (my list has about 45 
places on it.)  Some mail order outfits offer overnight service, which 
can be worth it even at $10-$15 a pop.

This should take care of most parts needed.  Oh, I almost forgot, sometimes 
it is a good idea to check with the local Porsche dealer.  They ocasionaly 
have reasonable prices on the item, and it is much easier than mail order. 
Good luck.

Subject: Renting a car in Europe - Non Porsche:( post

Going to Europe for the first time in January on a ski trip and would like 
to find out if it is realistic for me to rent a car, as in will I need it? 
do I want to do this? can I afford it? The various juncture points are JFK 
(New York), Milan (Italy), Courmayeur (Italy), and Chamonix (France). The 
motivation is daytripping to Switzerland from Courmayeur. A Porsche would 
be nice (isn't it always), but maybe something along the lines of a Lancia 
Delta Integrale or Alfa GTV would probably be much more affordable, and a 
bit more pleasant for the passenger(s). No 50hp Fiat 124's, but I guess the 
world car equivalent of a Chevy Corsica is plenty doable.

1) Is it faster to go from Courmayeur to Zermatt, ski a day and go back the 
same day by car or by train? Realistic? Fun?
2) Do I need an International driver's license? Get via AAA?
3) Is it cheaper to rent through an American company and would I get US 
rates? This trip is sadly out-of-pocket and non-deductible unless I 
schedule some LAN administrator interviews in Courmayeur.
4) What sort of insurance should I get or does AMEX or travel insurance 
provide? 

Unfortunately, European delivery of the 993 Carrera 4 is not an option at 
this time. Maybe when the 986 with the flat 6 comes out;)

Why do I think that Peter "frequent world traveler" A. is the perfect 
person to respond to this? Probably should E-mail replies. Thanks all.

With all the interest recently in mixing oil with coolant, does anyone have

Antifreeze mixed with Mobil-1 causes it to lose its lubricating properties.

Mine just went up 20% this past week, and tucked in at the bottom of the
statement was a $5 "service charge" that wasn't there previously.

I think I am also in search of a new company.

Doesn't it seem pathetic that a group as large as the people who pay 
insurance can't quite get up the same political muster as the insurance 
companies?  We just let them screw us up the butt year after year...
And made the exam-without-vaseline MANDATORY, which creates unfavorable

Hi, Jim,

First of all, the speedometer on a 1986 951 gets its input from a sender
mounted on the transmission. That signal is translated by the speedo gauge
to an analog indication.

As far as I know, the 1986 951 did not have ABS available as an option.

The tach gets its signal from the DME, which controls ignition and pulsed
fuel injection, but then translates it to another analog indication.

Which is more accurate?  Well, there is some inefficiency (slippage) in the
tire to road interface, so none of the instruments in the car are going to
be totally accurate in measuring linear speed (not to mention the theory of
relativity which states that your car is getting shorter as the speed
increases).

Perhaps the most accurate indicator of speed is one of those used by the
revenue gatherers around here, stationary K-band radar or stationary laser
speed guns.

YMMV...

I've also had problems repositioning the oil pres. sender on the RHS oil
line so that it doesn't interfere with the belt for my AC.  Do you

Unless you have a digital tach, the same potential for error
exists. Even if you have a cable-driven tach like the 356s or
"serious" race cars of yesteryear.

Exactly what a tach does.  Except the signal comes from the igition.

No-stop since 1981. Intermittent before that since '74. The beard is
reconfigurable regarding how full, how it's shaped and even whether

Hair length also varies from full buzzcut to pretty long, where it

The tach gets its signal from the "gear tooth sensor" (on the flywheel ?)
I believe. At least, if this sensor goes bad it effects the tach.

There is a two part video by Ruf. Part one is a factory type tour and 
part two is a crazy German driving the "Yellow Bird" for all it's worth. 
It's quite a video. Also highly recommended is "Rendezvous" a short but 
awesome video of a Ferrari driving through Paris at daylight. This guy 
goes blindly through red light after red light and even goes up on the 
curb to avoid a garbage truck. The later is available through several

It worked on my 914 the top used to rattle like crazy.  The rubber over the
pins had taken set and allowed the hold-down clamps to vibrate.  I cleaned
off the old coating and worked a stray piece of vacuum line (about 1/8 i.d.)
and worked it over the pins.  A quick snip to cut the tubing to length and,
viola!, no more rattling, squeaking top.

Now if I could just get those dang rear bushings to stay quiet.  They appear
to be hard after-market devices (nylon?).  Maybe I should convert them back
to stock.  It is a daily driver after all (when it's running, that is).

Subject: car lift

Just got the latest copy of the Imparts catalog. They advertise a pretty cool
car lift. It shows a 911 on top of a 300 Series Benz. It is a electrically
operated hydrolic lift. It allows two cars to be parked in the space of one.

You lower the ramp, drive up, lift the car and drive the other car underneath.
The whole thing is no higher that 9'. They say it fits in a regular garage...

Since the car is on a ramp, it would be easy to do engine work too!

Now for the bad news. It sells for $3.3K . But then again, it is cheaper than
building a second garage and there would not be any additional real state taxes
added to your bill due to the additional garage.

Does any one know who makes the unit or know of similar products?

I applied a light coat of grease over the said rubber and that took care 
of it.  

Now I have a question.  One of the front pins on the top is missing.  $15 at 
the dealership.  Will three pins on the top do or is it a crucial part
that has to be there?

hoses advertised in Pano in the $100-150 range (maybe cheaper).  Might be a 
bit messy but not to techinally challenging (although routing some of the 
hoses might be a pain...)

I'm interested more info on this too...  I've seen the gasket kits for ~ $100
but I'm not sure I want to tackle the timing/balance shaft belt related

I've done this!! Fairly simple.  You might want to get some kind of vacuum

How did they diagnose the head gasket problem??? You didn't mention any

Hose should be easy (except I think they recommend a new fluid reservoir too! 
$$)  Is the leak really coming from the pump or is it dribbling down the hose 
because of the clamp on the reservoir that is (mis)-used?  $115 sounds cheap 
for some kind of repair to the pump unless there are some easy o-ring issues 
...

Done this!!  The hard part is getting the caliper bolts off.  Mine were on 
TIGHT, and I had to do some gymnastics with a large wrench and a jack to get 
them off (probably not recommended...)  Also tricky to get the inner seal out 
of the hub ... (I should have pounded on it like Haynes said instead of prying 
it ...)  Getting  the wheel bearing "play" set right also requires some 
"feel".  (Haynes method left too much play,  maybe the workshop procedure is 
better???)

I would have made you flush the fluid.  Never, never, never go to a drivers

absorbs water extremely quickly, lowering the boiling point by a hundred
degrees or more.  Pro racers change fluid every DAY!

With all due respect, Jon, this is a little extreme.  Pro racers are 
operating
by a very different set of rules.  They also replace the pads, rotors, and
perhaps plumbing on a per-event basis, or more.

DOT 3 and DOT 4 fluid isn't all that hygroscopic.  As long as the fluid has
been changed in the last year, and the pedal is firm, you are OK.  If you
start playing with fancy stuff like AP 600, yes, it is a lot more 
hygroscopic and
ought to be changed much more frequently.

I like to keep PCA track events in perspective, and lower the perceived
barriers to entry so that more owners (and their SO's) c'mon out and join 
the
fun.  As long as your car is in fine mechanical shape, a day at the track 
for
a novice driver need not require anything more than regular maintenance
and a helmet.

This brings up some more questions I have. 

My 914 has a horrible squeak in the front suspension - has had it for 
some time.  I think it's in the A-arm bushings, which are the original
rubber ones.  

It is my understanding these are *not* replaceable, one has to buy the
entire A-arm.  Is that right?

Furthermore, my perusal of catalogs hasn't turned up any new ones for
years, so I think they're no longer available.  Anybody know?

One can upgrade to 911, 5-bolt front suspension, for mucho $$, or one
can replace the stock bushings with ones made of Delrin, or some other
hard plastic stuff I can't remember the names of right now.

I've always seen these aftermarket bushings advertised as 'curing' some
imprecision in the suspension - less give & all that.  Question is, if
one is relatively satisfied with the way it was originally, i.e,. I'm
not seeking a bone-jarring ride, is it advisable to consider changing
to these bushings.  Does it make a real difference in road feel?  Is 
the ride harsher with these things in there?

Also, is the top mount for the front strut available anyplace?  I know
other cars (notably VWs) recommend replacing those things to avoid 
front-end squeaks and rattles; is it necessary on a 914?  Is it doable?

Enough questions for now - I'm brimming over with them.

Thanks for any & all help,

Everyone,
	I drive a '74 Targa and can empathize with the squeakies
	and have solved the problem by lubricating the seals myself
	But I STRONGLY recommend that you use something other than 
	grease on these seals... The petroleum distilates in your average
	grease can spell disaster for certain types of rubber. If you 
	are unaware the rear targa seal is rediculously expensive..
	What I would use is a rubber or vynl protectant.. I have had
	bad luck with armor all in the past and have useed NuVynl with
	good results.. Just wipe on a reasonably generous coat with a
	clean rag and your done.. The worst of it is that you have
	to re-aply this every few weeks but to me this is better than
	trashing the seals.... My hardest problem is keeping the windows
	aligned enough to keep them from rattling without having too
	much pressure on the side portion of the rear seal...

So has anyone else received a copy of that nice 10-minute
video about the 993 from PCNA? Very high concept; the word
"Porsche" is only mentioned once (by a race-car driver),
and the only technical specs appear as a scroll at the end.

The whole idea is that people should follow their hearts
by buying 993s. That idea has some merit, I suppose. :-)
I must admit that the video even made me want to test-drive
a 993, and I'm a 944 kinda person. Too bad that national
TV time is so expensive; showing this during the right 
programs a few times would probably really boost the number
of people visiting Porsche showrooms.

I presume it was Patrick Stewart narrating; sounded like
him. Anyone know for sure? I don't expect we'll see a 993
in "Generations," though. :-)

I asked this same question a few months ago - namely "How well does
a pcar like Castrol GTX?".  I got a lot of responses, but as expected the
net result was that *alot* of people didn't like the Castrol, a few felt that
the brand of oil in a car is irrelevant, and the remainder thought Castrol
was the greatest stuff in the world.  Go figure.  I did change to
Valvoline racing oil, though, and noticed a slight increase in oil pressure
as a result.

As usual, YMMV...

YMMV, but I replaced my gear lube in my 915 with Mobil1.  Not a tremendous
improvement, but I would have to say that first to second shifts (up and
down) improved a bit.  I think most of the improvement
came at "parking lot" speeds.  First, reverse, etc. are easier to engage

The Aquatread "dual tire" kinda thing?  I read that these tires were good in
wet weather, but not *that* much better than other all-season tires.  OTOH,
the suck on dry pavement.  The tire test I read basically said don't waste

FWIW, I put a set of Falkens on my wife's car and am pretty impressed with

On any road with mile markers, divide the time (seconds) it takes to go one 
mile into 3600 and you will have the average speed. If you can hold your speed 
for several miles as consistantly as possible and divide into 7200 
for 2 miles (etc) you're apt to get a better reading.

DOT 3 fluid IS extremely hydroscopic. In fact is will absorb water thru
rubber brake lines. DOT 4 is better, but the dry boiling point of DOT4 is
lower than the dry boiling point of a Heavy Duty, high temp DOT3. 

I'm all for encouraging people to come to the track.  I've been instructing
at these things since 1980, 6 to 12 events per year.  I've see NUMEROUS cars
messed up because of old brake fluid.  Lets face it, a street car at a first
drivers school typically has stock type brake pads, fluid, that if you're
lucky, has been changed in the past month, and NEVER before that. And from
personnel experience, the first flushing of old fluid does not get all of the
old stuff out.  Too many nooks and crannies in a brake system. These street
cars are also heavy which puts an even greater strain on the braking system.
A significant portion of the newer students are in cars that have had
horsepower mods, with NOATHING done to the brakes or suspension. And what do
these students count on more than anything else in a school but their brakes.
I'm trying to give students every edge I can.  I'm also trying to give the
instructors every edge of getting out alive that I can. I enjoy instructing,
but only if I KNOW that the car is in good shape. Nothing worse than being
with a student at the end of a straight and him yelling "No brakes"!  

Would you get in a car that has tires showing cord; no.  Would you get into a
car that has pads down to the backing plates; no. Would you let a car on the
track that is dribbling fluids; no. Flushing brake fluid is CHEAP insurance,
like changing your oil every 3000 miles.  Only this time, your LIFE may
depend on it.

Stan, Care to comment?

Hi, 
I figured out how to get the Whale Movie if you are using a Mac. It really
takes along time to download if you are using 2400 baud.(9600 hasn't been
made available to me yet)
 So here goes:

Keyword FTP
click on "enter ftp area"
click on "go to ftp"
click on "other site"
type in "tta.com"  (do *not* check the box that says to ask for userid and

select the "pub" folder
 ... then the "porschephiles"
.... then "Images"
... then "Moving"
The file "whale-movie"  *should* be there somewhere.

Hope that helps

Subject: prepping for track events

As a PCA , BMW club, Corvette club and Car Guys instructor for the past 6 or
7 years I have a need to get into the discussion concerning car prep for
track events. I also served as Tech Chair for my region for two years and
although I haven't seen it all I've seen enough to scare me.
I'm all in favor of encouraging newcomers to track events. We always need new
blood as long as it's not freshly spilled. In my opinion the biggest obstacle
to newcomers seems to be drilling a couple of holes for the fire
extinguisher. It's interesting that these same good folks are not the least
bit reticent to bugger up their beauties with cellular phones.
It is unbelievable to me how some members actually get mad when you point out
safety problems with their cars. I've rejected cars for oil leaks, loose
cameras in the cars, old brake fluid, bad and mal adjusted wheel bearings,
rust, the list goes on and on. Universally none of these good folks ever
thanked me for potentially saving their lives! Acted like I was the enemy as
a matter of fact.
I feel that brake fluid needs to be fresh if for no other reason than I might
be in the car. It also serves as notice that although it should be a fun
time, we as instructors and inspectors take the safety aspect VERY seriously.
I've seen novices go fast enough and brake hard enough to boil the fluid and
then bitch the rest of their weekend that their brakes "feel funny". Tell
them to bleed their brakes and they look at you like you came from Mars.
Fresh fluid obviously has a higher boiling point and a larger starting safety
margin.
The scariest incident that I was involved in happened with fresh fluid. It
was at Summit Point and I was instructing a rather large fellow in a T-Bird
SC. I'm no lightweight and between the two of us the whole package weighed
about 4500lbs. Hurtling down the straight at about 115MPH this fellow jumped
all over his brakes. I mean he scared himself sufficiently to hoist his whole
self out of the seat and stomp on the brakes with both feet at which time one
of the front piston seals took the opportunity to completely let go. Luckily
Summit has an escape road and we took a rather length tour of the scenery and
the agriculture. Quite lovely this time of the year, I might add.
I'm also in favor of safety regs becoming stricter as the student advances in
ability but that's another whole discussion. 
Nuff said.

Subject: Re: prepping for track events

Someone asked my opinion on the subject of pros and cons and timing on
changing brake fluid. And then I see this note:

> We always need new
> blood as long as it's not freshly spilled. 

which pretty much says it all.

I've done racing under most of the major US sanctioning bodies (and if
there was some way to push a MBZ "pushrod" engine through the Winson
Cup rules, I even have a sponsor for that...). I've also done "track days" 
or "driver ed" events under PCA, Jag, and Ferrari club sanction.

Most of the really bad stuff I've seen comes from underpreparation; some 
comes from overpreparation (some of the biggest jerks at club events are
the SCCA guys that are typically well behaved and responsible at SCCA
road races); a smaller percentage still comes from just
plain old Bad Luck.

I do my dead level best to get new Porsche owners to take their cars
to autocrosses *FIRST* then track days. I'm much more concerned with
that inner-ear gizmo that says "hey, buddy --- you're going WAY too fast"
tripping at about 0.75Gs at 100 MPH without the driver having had the
experience of dealing with that a priori at parking lot speeds. Preventing
panic is about as important as preventing mechanical accidents.

Once someone has some seat time at a lower speed, it's MUCH easier to 
convince them that they really, really, really do need to pay some attention
to the mechanicals. I personally think that for street cars, you need to
change the brake fluid every year, and that if you're going to the track
a lot, you need to change it every 3-4 months. More often if you notice 
brake problems, or if it starts to change color. For the race cars, I
use the thermopaint that lets me know how hot at least some of the moving
parts got. Based on that, I set a schedule for changing brake fluid. I
*BLEED* the brakes every day it's at the track though -- even if it's
only a practice day on Friday.

And I agree whole-heartedly that many, many of the club guys in particular
act as though they've got some God-given right to put their car on the
track any way that they want to, any time that they want to and no one
is going to make them follow any rules. Personally, I like to see guys like
that tossed out summarily. Keep their money, and send them packing. I
certainly don't need them creating problems on the track. The rules are
there for three reasons: 1) to make sure that things are done in a reasonable
manner because it's just a good idea to have some control in these 
situations, (2) to make sure that no one is endangered by anyone else, 
and MOST IMPORTANTLY (3) to make sure that the damned INSURANCE is in 
force. If you can't get or sustain insurance, you CAN NOT GET THE TRACK.

Then, of course, this all becomes moot.

There are a couple of well known things in the tire world:

1) Pirellis go out of round prematurely. 

2) Michelins de-laminate at 5 years regardless of milage.

Never looked into the Pirelli problem very hard, but a couple of
passes with a band saw is pretty illuminating on the Michelin problem.
Whatever they clad the belts with DOESN'T WORK. Corrosion seems to develop
between the belts, and after a certain *TIME* (not milage -- I've seen
this happen on 5-year old tire with 15k miles), the belts don't want to 
be together any more...

You can argue that until then, they make an OK tire. I, however, 
have my doubts.

Yes, and no. You can not get the original rubber bushings other than

You don't find all kinds of things in catalogs. You can get the parts
from Porsche. Last time I checked, like about a year ago, they were
$450 each.

If you like the "stock feel" and this is NOT primarily a competition vehicle
and you have a kilobuck laying around (replace the ball joint too), then
I'd say you should replace the whole A-arm and get the rubber bushings
back. Remember, they lasted 20 years last time... if you take the long
view, it's only $25 a year...

Howver, if this is a competition vehicle, words cannot describe adequately
how big a difference a non-compliant bushing makes. In fact, I like to use
aluminum in some cases, or convert completely to spherical bearings if
the rules allow me to. You would *NOT* want to drive your date home
in a car with solid bushings. You probably wouldn't even want to drive
on the track for more than a couple of hours at a time, or every chance
you get 8{)

I've never seen one break on a street car, but it's not clear that they
don't. You can get them through Porsche. Again, for competition, you can
get a spherical bearing version with camber/caster adjusters from Automechanika
in Denver (OK, *NEAR* Denver -- Golden or some such place off southwest of
downtown). Again, not necessary on street cars.

Hi, George -

Ah, I think maybe we best keep this fact of Uncle Albert wild and crazy
ideas to ourselves.  If some of the more lucid from the .goldchains.vapid
list catch wind of this there is going to be terrible consternation that
somehow if they go fast their prize will get shorter and that may be too
much for these macho gentlemen to handle!  Think of the depression that
would set in: dealerships fold, factories close, famine, food riots, etc..
The only way these good 'ole boys could cope would be to swill their Prozac
down with lots of Bud Lite.

All his from "...the faster you go, the shorter it gets!"

So considering the dire possibilities, maybe "mum's the word" is best.

When I asked my insurance agent this question, he said that since the
coverage is active when people other than myself are driving the vehicles,
that is why the "double" charge. 

Now that I re-read your message though, you state "are only getting coverage

Subject: 944 Aluminum Control Arm Breakage

There has been an increase in the number of broken Aluminum Control Arms
(Front A-arms) on Porsche 944 models (starting with the 1985/2 models) which 
have been lowered.

The failure mode is a shearing of the pin on the ball joint when the wheel is
unloaded going into a corner.  At the Zone 1 President's meeting discussion
of track event safety on Saturday, it was determined that there have been
five such incidents in Zone 1 during 1994.

Evidently, the change in angle due to the lowering of the car takes the ball
joint to the limit of angular travel, and when further subjected to stress,
breaks completely.

According to several observers and tech inspectors, there is no warning
prior to the breakage.  All of the cars involved were given complete
technical inspections prior to the events, and nothing unusual was observed.

Several members of Zone 1 are investigating the causes and possible
solutions to this safety problem.

Please note that this problem only has occurred on cars which have been
lowered.  Additional problems with the control arms include breakage of the
arm itself near the mounting position of the anti-roll bar, and release of
the ball from the socket of the joint.

Subject: Interesting F1 race inspired me......

Hi folks,

As the title say, todays F1 race at Suzuka (?) inspired me to work on my '60 
race project today. And boy did I!

During the better part of this sunday I welded in the front half floor pan 
properly(was only tac welded a few places), installed the left longitudinal 
member, installed the suspension member (k-piece), and also formed and 
installed angled patches for the lower 2" of the toeboard. Oh, don't forget 
I formed and installed logitudinal supports (2 that is). 

One effective flow of cutting, forming, welding, sealing, etc.

It's starting to look good...

I guess I actually have to work on the car if I want it ready....??!!!  ;-)

cheers,
trond

Hi Folks:
Care to give me a few pointers on touching up the stone chips on the front of
my blue Porsche (with white primer, ugh!)?  I think this winter will be the
time I finally tackle this much needed project.  If you're up for it please
give me a step by step description of prep, applic, sanding or rubbing, top
coat, etc., etc.  I will down load them and try them in the garage this fall.
 
The factory touch-up paint I recently got is now a 2 part system, ocean blue
and clear top coat.  (Original touch up paint was only the blue, and it is
all used up).  Many thanks.

Why does he want to replace the air cleaner?  Aesthetics?  That may not
be a good enough reason.  There's probably a reason the air cleaner is

Anthony,

The more likely cause of your problem is that the oil pressure
relief valve is hung up, after the reassembly.  Which may be
because whoever did the work did not use the line-up tool when
locating and tightening the oil/water heat exchanger manifold.

The o-ring at the end of the relief valve should also be checked,
and normally replaced while things are apart.

Jim,

The RaceTec cage is a nice one.  The shop has installed them in a
number of 944 and 911 series cars, and they like the part.  Whatever
you get, make sure it is terminated in the frame rails rather than
the floor pan.  The RaceTec fits this bill.

Actually, a more slippery film will be detrimental to a 901/915 box as a
certain amount of friction is required for the syncros to work properly.  A
very winning GPT team tried every synth oil on the market and couldn't
finish an endurance race due to gearbox failures.  They ended up using a
conventional dino oil that was compounded with better anti-sling properties
and recorded significant trans temperature reduction *AND* they started
finishing and winning endurance races.  Makes sense doesn't it?  Keep the
oil on the gears and it can do it's job....

Subject: Re: 944 Aluminum Control Arm Breakage

944 Front A-arm Failures: We have experienced catastrophic front suspension
ball joint failures on a few track driven 944 Turbos. These cars have tended
to be the Turbo S models. We are interested in what is know about the failure
of the 944 Turbo S ball joints. 

As you know the ball joints of the 944 Turbo are epoxyed to the control arm,
such that the replacement entail the purchase of a new control arm, which is
more than $1,000. The latest one that we saw fail had less than 15,000 miles
of use. Like most track cars these cars are lowered and were running with
relatively large negative camber angles. It appears that the pin (or spud) of
the ball joint is what actually breaks. We believe that the failure mode is
that first the ball joint becomes loose, possibly cracking the epoxy an then
it is the movement of the ball joint that allows the ball joint to rock
sufficiently to fail. 

The factory and many customers have raced the 944 Turbo and derivatives
(Turbo Cup) and continue to do so (968 and 968 Turbo RS). Is there an updated
part of a racing replacement for the stock ball joint. Is there anything else
relating to this problem that has been learned from racing these cars. 

Thank you for your fax concerning the 944 ball joint problem. Yes, the 944
ball joints have been a problem, actually I think that the problem applies
pretty much equally to all of the cars with the cast aluminum A-arm, and that
was everything from the 1985 1/2 944 model on. Because of the problem that
you describe with the ball joint IMSA requires any 944 or 968 that run in
their races to use FABCAR front A-arms and ball joints as replacements for
the originals. 

FABCAR fabricates their A-arms out of heat treated 4130 with a replaceable
monoball (spherical bearing) and then they make their own pin out of
stainless. The FABCAR A-arms are $800 each complete, or $1,600 per pair. If
you want nylon bushings they are $35 each extra with two per arm. I would
think that it would make a lot more sense to by a pair of the FABCAR A-arms
when one breaks, you are already more than half way there if one factory arm
cost more than $1,000.

Tech Tips for Drum Brakes

Stan Hanks
NNJR

I know that drum brakes have about as much relevance for most of you as
Fremat's Last Theorem, but for some people it really does matter... In
discussing the Brake Job From Hell with an old friend that used to 
race stock cars with me, he reminded me of all the really crazy things
we did to make those enormous cars stop once thyey were moving at the 
fairly high speeds we would attain on the one mile tracks. The little 
old drum brakes had to really, really work for a living!

After we rang off, I got to thinking about it -- surely those ideas we had
used came from SOMEWHERE.  So I called Elmer Fohey, who used to turn bolts 
for Norman Scott's 550s and Carrera Speedsters back when racing them seemed 
like a good idea and the idea of warehousing them and polishing them with 
diapers had not yet been conceived.  He confirmed my suspicions that we 
hadn't invented these techniques, and suggested that there were a lot of 
people out there that had never heard of them, so I decided it might be 
time to write this up.

The secret is simple and should be obvious, but that seems not to be
the case: you take some pains to turn the drums to get them true and
concentric with the hub, but the shoes are not "round" out of the box!
Our trick was simple. We took a red marking pencil, and marked down the 
center of each shoe. Then we'd bolt the brakes back together, stop hard
once, and take it apart. Inevitably, part of the line would be gone, but 
never all of it. So we'd get the belt sander, and take a little off the
portion of the shoe which had contacted the drum. Then we'd re-draw the
line and repeat. 

We'd keep this up until all eight of the shoes were making 100% contact
with the drums. The difference between brakes treated like this and
a "vanilla" out-of-the-box brake job was like night and day. Elmer also
allowed as how he'd been very successful with this in Formula Vee and 
autocrossing Beetles, which led to some additional discussion, and
the realization that this would probably even work BETTER for autocross
than for racing, since the heat problem would be less.

Now, for the real ultimate brakes, I hear that the folks at Cool Carbon
and Performance Metallic will put their carbon/kevlar compounds on your
core shoes for a fee... Just imagine the look on the face of the 930
drivers when your 356A stops in half the distance!

	I saw this beastie up close in the paddock at Le Mans. Even
managed to get quite a good photograph of it (just crouched down with the
camera to my eye for 15 mins or so until there was nobody in the way!). An
awsome machine.

	Apparently it was driving around the track on the day before the
race, though I missed it. When I was driving my 944 round the track, there
were Gendarmarie every 10 metres or so, and hence *no* temptation to
exceed the speed limit, but I'm told that the 962 was going, em, "rather
fast" when it was out, and nobody stopped it.

	My '89 911 (G50 box) had slight difficulty going from 1st to 2nd
when it was cold. (Not *very* cold you understand, this is England we're
talking about). 29,000 miles and probably original clutch (before I bought
the car the salesman told me it had had a new clutch, but I can find no
evidence anywhere in the service records).

	The dealers replaced the fluid with 75W/90 a couple of weeks ago
and it has made quite a difference - the shift is noticeably smoother.

	However, occasionally I get a loud "crack" when I take the car out
of 1st, especially when the car is cold. Feels as if the car is jumping out
of gear. Any thoughts as to what might be causing this? The car is still
under warranty, so I'd like to get it fixed.

Hi,

I relation to the above mentioned car lifts, I was at the New England Auto
Show (see below for a major problem with this show) this weekend and in the 
accessories room, there was a company there that was selling a device to 
rotate a car onto its side to perform work on the underside of the car.  
Yes, I said rotate.  

Basically, how it works is that you remove the wheels from one side of the
car, and bolt these semi-circle steel bow like structures onto the studs that 
the wheels were on.  Then, on the other side of the car, you remove the wheels
and bolt on a lift mechanism which you power from the top via an electric
drill.  When the drill power winch lifter mechanism begins to lift one side
of the car, the other side with the 90 degree steel circular bows rolls on
the bows (which are on the ground) and the whole car pivots to about 80 
degrees to on side.  (As if it would look if traveling on two wheels like
they do to some cars in the movies).  It was an interesting concept, but one
that I feel would put undue strain on the suspension conponets of some cars.
I certainly would not subnject my 911 to that.  I have no info on manufacture.

The other issue I wanted to raise, which probably should have come first is 
that the were NO PORSCHES at this auto show!  I was dissapointed.  Every
other car maker I culd think of had at least one or more cars there.  
Mercedes, Lotus, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Jaguar, Range Rover, Audi, Sabb, and
all the big ones - Ford, Chevy, Nissan, Toyota, etc. all had cars on display.
BUT NO PORSCHE!  Why is this?  As this is one of the largest and the first
big new car show in the country, I wuld have expected to see my favorite cars
there, but none to0 be found.  They even had Hummers on display, and a bunch
of new concept cars.  Not a single AWD 993 to be found.  This is one thing
that Porsche has done that I feel to be a big mistake.

Hello all.

Thank you for all your help.  I have finally started my 930 this weekend.

It turns out there were two bad relays, one to the fuel pump, and one for the 
ignition cutoff.  This was obvious since the fuel pump was always on when the 
ignition was on, and the CDS unit did not whistled (It had no power).

Replacing these and removing the jumper cable allowed the engine to start.  I 
was using a jumper cable since I can't get my new battery into the car (It seems
too big).  I put a smaller battery in, and she started without any hassle.

The turbo smoked like a banshee for about 20 minutes.  But driving around for 
1/2 hour cleared that up.

Thanks again for everyone's help.

   My next major expense will be rustoration of the passenger side
   inner rocker area.  Both the jack post and the convex piece of sheet metal
   used for floor jacks at the rear of the car (what is this thing called?)
   are useless due to rust.  I have heard that this is a common 914 malady and
   the result of acid dripping from the battery.

   Although there is no discernable body sag or panel misalignment I have
   virtually no rear pass side jack point.  Further, I have been told by my
   normal mechanic that until this project is completed upgrading my

I too saw the show this weekend. I was also very dissappointed there were no
Porsches to be found. Is this typical of PCNA's marketing dept. ? Bad call. 
Perhaps they only hit shows which THEY deem important.  It was good to see really
new products though, instead of changes in grille work we have seen in the past!

Len,

I put synthetic in my '88 911 (G-50 trans) and noticed no
difference at all other than maybe a little easier shifts
just after starting up when its cold out.

John, it sounds like your selenoid is not energizing. Just went through that
last Friday...

A few weeks ago, I get on the car to go to work, turn the key and NOTHING...
Got in my other car and went to work. Came home in the afternoon, and car
started with no problem.

It did the same thing Friday morning. This time I wanted to find the problem andcure it. I looked at the archives and deducted that perhaphs my ignition switch
was malfunctioning. So I decided to take it apart and run some contact
cleaner. I had lubed the key part of the switch and thought that some lube
got into the switch.  It was a real pain to get to it, spcially the upper screw.Ended up using a phillips bit, on a 1/4" socket and a small rachet. No screw
driver can fit there.

After removing the switch, I was getting the same problem. I then proceded to
clean the terminals at the starter. Turned the key and nothing. I could hear thepump going, the gauges and dash lights were on but no starter engaging.

My next step was to do an electrical test. There are two terminals at the
starter (actually 3, but one of them is not usually used...) There is a real
big stud that connects to 2 wires. One of the is red and connects to the
alternator. The other is connected by a thick wire to the battery.
Be careful, since this one is always HOT! Finally, there is a small yellow
wire that connects to the selenoid that gets power when you turn the key.

The sequence of events is as follows: turn key, pump goes on along with all
electrical systems (pos 2 in key switch).
Turn key all the way and power goes to yellow cable that
energizes selenoid. Selenoid acts like a giant magnet and retracts lever that
pushes gear that engages flywheel. At the same time, selenoid closes big mama
contact the powers starter via the big mama cable connected to the battery.

Electrical tests are as follows, using a voltmeter or light, test for voltage
at the big selenoid connector. You should always have juice there.
With the key at the starting position, there should be power at the yellow wire.Your problem could be a bad selenoid or perhaps the mechanical lever that
pushes the gear out could be broken. It sounds like you are getting power to thebig connector since the starter is turning.

Now the fun part begins. Have you ever gotten a starter out on a 911 with the
engine in place?! You got to be part octopus. Its really tight in there. You
will need a 10mm hex bit. The lower nut comes out easy. The one you can't see
is a challenge. My fear was stripping the nut and having to drop the engine
to remove the bolt :( It can be done as the scrapes in my forearm prove it...
Just make sure you have the bit in correctly and that you are not turning
the wrench crooked. A cheater bar helped me.

Now, a relay can be bought for about $80 to $90 at the P shops. I called my
local aternator guy and he tested the starter. It did not kick in the first two
times, then it worked. He suggested adding a load reducing selenoid instead of
using the factory's yellow wire. I told him that I would try the selenoid first.He ordered a selenoid for me. It is going to be ~$38, or so he says. I should
have it tomorrow and then I can play octopus again :)
 
Also, there is a ground strap between the trans and the body. I would suggest
cleanning it to make sure you get a good ground ( got to keep those electrons
happy, you know..). I am going to check and clean mine as a maintenence item
before I install the starter.

Looking, back, I guess I should have done the electrical test firsts but then
again, I could not have passed this info to you folks. Live and learn...

Hope this helps you all! Will let you know how selenoid works out

Subject: 944/928 bal/cam belts tensioning

Hi all,
My 'multi-manufacturer' car mechanic contacts
say there is nothing that special about the
cam and bal. belt tension on 944/928. 

When faced w/ a water pump job, I was advised to 
use the normal 'common sense' approach to belt tension
which my buddies say they use all the time on 944/928 belts.

i.e.
1) shoot for about 1/4 turn of belt motion in 
the longest span.
2) if is screams, it's too tight.

I did the water pump, tensioned the belts and 
all seems OK.

Have other "backyard" mechanics tried this?  Am I
overlooking something about this situation?

=======================================================================

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

=======================================================================

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

=======================================================================

Who is the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          President, NetSmiths, Ltd.
          2025 Lincoln Highway
          Edison, NJ 08817

     He lives in Houston TX and works in Edison NJ (Don't bitch about 
*YOUR* commute): 
          Houston: e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
                   voice:  (713) 661-2084 
                   FAX:    (713) 661-0633
          Edison:  e-mail: stan@netsmiths.com 
                   voice:  (908) 287-8070 
                   FAX:    (908) 287-3883

     His cars currently include:  
          '81 Euro 911SC Targa (daily driver when he's where it is)
          '74 914 2.0 (SCCA ITA/PCA Club Racing)
          '64 356 SC (OK, so he fell in love again).

=======================================================================

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

=======================================================================

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  

=======================================================================

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available via FTP at tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/
Archives in five subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94) each of which has 
the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan
may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to mail you
archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY
mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program,
or equivalent, to restore to textual format.

=======================================================================

What else is available in the tta.com archives?

     FAQs: This FAQ; also specific FAQs about specific Porsche models
are being added (so far there's only one, for the 914--feel free to
contribute one on YOUR favorite Porsche).
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

=======================================================================
 
Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/Porschephiles/home.html.
The FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

=======================================================================

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions?  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts..."

     In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split.

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

Which clubs are there for Porsche owners?

=======================================================================

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

=======================================================================

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
            1970.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914, 1976.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
            of the four-cylinder engine.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 as the 924S with the 944 drivetrain.
            Has the best aerodynamic shape of any Porsche.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the
            front, water-cooled, has grown from an original 4.5 litres 
            to 5.4 today.

            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, introduced in 4/94.

=======================================================================

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

=======================================================================

What are the meanings of terms and acronyms I've seen in the list?

     IMHO - In my humble opinion
     IMO  - In my opinion
     PCA  - Porsche Club of America, the major US/Canada Porsche

            PCA, which has many interest groups participating
     PCGB - Porsche Club of Great Britain
     PCNA - Porsche Cars of North America (Reno, NV), the US importer
     PANO - Not an acronym; this stands for Porsche Panorama, the PCA

            company has publicly traded stock
     WWW  - World Wide Web
     YMMV - Your mileage may vary
     :-)  - Smiley face (turn your head 90 degrees to the left to "read"
            it); various iterations exist using different ASCII 
            characters
    
=======================================================================

What are the major Porsche periodicals besides Porsche Panorama?

What are some of the major Porsche aftermarket suppliers?

     Be aware when buying a part in the aftermarket that it may or may
not be the same part you would get from Porsche.  This holds true even
when the part carries the "correct" Porsche part number, and when it
carries Porsche's parts trademark.  The following suppliers, listed
alphabetically, have been praised by various Porschephiles:

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:

procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

=======================================================================

Should I use an oil additive in my Porsche engine?

     This is Stan's response:  Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil.  Or as Bruce 
Anderson commented about something else, "a cash flow device."  Slick-50
is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case.  Guess what we 
all have, eh?  There is a bit of info on it via anonymous FTP in tta.com
in /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo.  Additionally, many of these additives 
use teflon.  DuPont (the inventors of Teflon) have stated categorically 
that teflon is useless in such applications.
 
=======================================================================

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other renowned Porsche people) here?
 
     Bruce was invited to join and did so back in '91. The load then
was too much for him.  All of what, 2k a day or so.  Now, at 15x to 20x
that load, he probably doesn't want back on.  He's not stupid -- he 
knows where we are.

     No specifics are available regarding other renowned Porsche people.
If they want to be known, they will announce their presence.  (Besides,
your definition of "renowned" may differ from mine.)

=======================================================================

Where can I get a copy of the latest version of this FAQ?

     The FAQ is stored on tta.com in the /pub/porschephiles/FAQs

the same one sent out monthly.  (There's also a FAQ that's specific to
the 914; other specific FAQs are welcomed, if anyone wants to contribute
to the archives.)

=======================================================================

Who maintains this FAQ?

     The FAQ is maintained by Walt Thode (thode@nprdc.navy.mil).  I have
a 1972 911T as my daily driver.  Anyone who wants to contribute to the
FAQ can do so.  Contributions, revisions, and suggestions for new items
are always welcomed.  I peruse the list for potential additions, but

Subject: oil gallery plug failures on 914/4 engine cases.


	A friend's 914/4 just spit out one of the aluminum plugs which
are used to fill the holes at the end of the oil galleries. This
resulted in a loss of *all* of the oil and MAJOR damage to the engine.
 
	2 years ago, my street car did the same thing. Fortunately(?!),
it happened first thing in the morning as I was backing down the driveway
so I was able to stop before it pumped out all of the oil and destroyed the
motor. I repaired it by driving the plug back in and then sealing it off
with the brown permatex sealant.
	
	QUESTIONS:

	Is there a good way to test the integrity of the plugs without
removing them from the engine ? (I'll have my transmission out tonight
to investigate a noise coming from my clutch and a minor oil leak)

	If one of these plugs come out, what is the correct way to 
replace it / seal up the hole.

	If a loose or suspect plug is found in the motor, is there a
way to fix it with the motor still together and in the car ?

Subject: 951 Voltmeter - Warning of big problem?

On my '86 951, when I turn on the car, the voltmeter in the right side of 
the gauges, reads a hair over the middle of the range at about 13.1, which 
I believe is optimal. After drive it for a while, the voltmeter reads about 
12.3. If I have various accessories like lights and radio on, it can reads 
between 11.9 and 12.2, even when I am driving. The alternator warning light 
never kicks on. If I start the car with the lights and radio on (don't 
ask), it rarely but sometimes hesitates, has a wavering idle and dies. The 
car seems marginally down on power. If I stop/start the car, the voltmeter 
still reads about 12.2. If I stop/wait hours/start the car, then the whole 
cycle starts again.

Any guesses? My guess is that the battery can no longer handle the load.

Fixes? - Any experience with gel cell batteries? Costs?

From: michael@helix.nih.gov (Michael A. Freed)

Alan, Common causes of leaks into passenger compartment of 914 are:
1) Seal on top of windshield frame. If seal seems intact, the fit between
top and frame can be adjusted (look at hardware on targa top).
2) Rust through near where engine cover release comes through fire wall,
and other places near fire wall. Is the release knob woobly? If it is, then
firewall has rusted here. Patch these holes.
3) Drains in 2 wells in back of/ outboard of firewall are clogged. This
probably causes rust-through in firewall (see above). At the bottom of
these wells, there is a little rubber drain, which has to be unclogged or
simply removed. Michael
4) Poor fit between rubber gasket at top of side window and the seal on top
of windshield frame. Purchase new top gasket and cut to fit. Or use some
black silicone cauking for now.
I found all these leaks be sitting in my car on several rainy days. Michael

Subject: Re:Garage Lifts

Phello Philers, Bart Chambers and I have been trading notes on the above
subject. He referred me to the ad in AutoWeek.  Below is an edited synopsis
of my reply to Bart, which I guess I should have posted to P-philes.

The Good News:
Okay, I retrieved my latest copy of AUTOWEEK (Oct. 31, 1994) and, sure
enough, right there on page 44 is an ad for both an "M4 Service Lift" and a
"T6 Service Lift".

The Bad News is that I called these guys and found out the following:
The M4 is a "Drive On" type lift. Great for changing oil and messing around
under the car, but absolutely no good for suspension work, dropping out an
engine, corner balancing, or anything else requiring a free-floating suspension.

The T6 is a 3-legged gizmo, hooked together with 3 permanently affixed
steel beams in the shape of a "T". these have sliding pads on them that go
under the chassis pick up points, one on each side, and one on either the
front or rear depending on how the car is driven onto the lift.  While this
does allow for free floating suspension, trying to find a solid spot for
the third pick up point will likely be a problem. Too, this layout will not
allow you to work on both ends of the car at the same time as the third
(longitudinal) beam will always be in the way.

There is a lift advertised in the latest Imparts "Holiday" catalog, but it
has the same drawbacks as "M4" above, and cost almost twice as much.

- ---I don't own a 944, but I was thinking of buying one.  When the long,
long, tread about belt adjusting, replacing, readjusting, began to get me
nervous I asked a local mechanic about his philosophy.  Don't flame me, this
is his opinion.  

1)You don't need a special expensive Porsche tool to adjust the belt.  He
basically suggested the above method.

2)Once it's adjusted, don't mess with it again until you replace it.  The
constant readjusting is one reason the belts may break.

3)He also does BMW and Mercedes and uses this same tecnique for them.

The plugs are a friction fit in the case. The correct proceedure involves
re-sizing the hole to the next size up (and engine-apart operation)
then pressing in  a new plug. If I'm building a "serious" engine either
for street or racing, I *ALWAYS* pull those plugs to make sure the
gallies are completely clean. For racing applications, I tend to have
the hole tapped and use a threaded plug. That way, I can take it out
easier next time, and I have NO worries about it blowing out.

Only if you don't mind a half-ass fix. You can use a slide hammer puller
and pop the plug out, then get a next-size plug, beat the hell out of
it as you drive it into the case, and ignore the metal shavings you just
put in the oil. You could use JB Weld as a sealer on the old plug and
hope that holds and that you didn't get a blob of it floating around
the oil. Etc.

Hello All;

At tech inspection this past weekend, I learned that the right side motor mount 
on my 951 has collapsed.  This is most likely the cause of my vibration at idle.  
The left mount seems to be OK for now.

I know we have been over this before, but please bear with me.  Do I need to 
have both mounts replaced at the same time?  The dealer wants $240 parts and 
three hours labor @ $62/hour to replace one side.  Local independent wants $200 
parts and 2 hours labor at $62/hour for one.  I want to pay $130 parts and do it 
myself put I am afraid of getting in over my head.  This will be more work than 
I have ever done on my own, but this is why I bought a USED Porsche in the first 
place.

So, I have a garage, 2 jack stands, a floor jack and a day off on Friday before 
this weekends driver's ed.  Is this a job that a beginner can accomplish in a 
day?  I know that Jim Pasha recently wrote an article for Excellence Magazine 
concerning MM replacement.  Where can I get a copy or reprint of this article?  
I am willing to attempt this, but need some moral support (which will NOT come 
from my SO!).  Haynes manual does not seem to cover this replacement too well.  
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

The car was reportedly (prior owner info here) hit in a parking lot and I need
to take the car in for repainting of the rear bumper covers due to the

is yellowing. (Peter A. has already given me assistance on paint materials)
While it is in the shop I would like to consider putting on the new streamlined
'92 mirrors. I understand that they have a different footprint than the
standard mirrors and would require some painting of the door. Does anyone have
any idea if this can be accomplished without complete repainting of the doors?
I'd really hate to create a match problem and would forgo the mirrors if this
is the case.

The car came with the '92 17' Fuchs wheels. What air pressures (street) are

Subject: 911 TACH STICKING

I have had an anoying problem on the tach of my 77 911S for a couple of years.

When the air temperature was reasonable below 80 deg.f the tach worked fine but
above this temperature the tach needle would stick at anything above 2000 RPM.

Last weekend I decided to take the unit apart and clean it. A small screw
driver can be used to ease the lip of the retaining ring. Work a round the lip
moving the screw driver a quarter of an inch at a time and rotating the screw
driver 30 degrees or so. When you have gone around the whole lip use a slightly
larger screw driver and repeat the operation. At this point the retaining lip
should be opened up enough to ease the ring off the tach. Don't drop the glass!

Three screws hold the mechanism to the case from the back. Remove them and you
have it apart. One is self taping and used to provide a case earth.

My investigation of the mechanism showed not dirt or contamination so I
investigated the face of the instrument and found that the center of the
needle, above the spindle showed abraisions.I surmised that the needle was
touching the perspects of the cover. This cover seems slightly concave so I
simply reversed it and refitted the face. Problem solved.

Using a large screwdriver the lip can be persuaded back to its original
position. Place the tach face down on a folded towel while doing this.

The back lip of the face holder is pretty much scratched up at this point but
if you are careful with the whole process nothing will be visible from the
front or sides and the back is against the rubber gromet holder so all is well.

Hope this explanation helps someone.

There's no way to do it. Hence, it's something that I just about always 
do to cases when I have occassion to have one apart. Type I and IV,
not 356, not 911 (except for real race car engines, and I don't do
too many of them these days).

It's a VW thing. In general, the practice in the '50s and '60s was to
routinely replace the case in an engine rebuild. None of the aircooled
engines was expected to make it beyond 100k miles, and in fact, there
was more or less a bias that strongly suggested that you rebuild motors
every 4-5 years regardless of milage. In fact, up through the mid-70s,
new VW cases were cheap -- like under $200 for Type I and IV. 

> 	Why just JB weld and not Arc weld ?

Not sure arcwelding or mig welding or anything else is a great idea
for an engine still together. That's a lot of heat that has to go
somewhere, and I like to doubly re-check all the dimensions after
doing any welding work on an engine part.

I chased an annoying low-speed-only 'clunk' in the front of my '83 911SC
through a goodly number of $$ (ball joints, a-arm bushings, shocks,
wheel bearings), finally to find that *stiction* in the Bilstein shock
shaft seals was the culprit.  For a quick check, smear a trace of MoS2
grease around the shaft and see if the noise goes away.  Your steering
may also become less "notchy" and more lively, always a plus :-).

On my car the upper strut bearing tries to put a moment into the top of
the shock, and this seems to have something to do with the stiction and
binding.  I don't have a permanent fix yet, though I've been thinking
about those Automechanika spherical upper strut bearings that Stan
recently mentioned.  How about trashing the Bilsteins and switching to
adjustable Konis?

I did.  AND IT WORKS!!!  The stuff is called Wurth HKS-2000; it comes to
us from Germany (distilled by elves in the Black Forest, judging by the

*both ends* of each of your bushings (yes this means behind that pesky
felt seal at the rear of the rear bushing), and... well, for me, 4
months and 3,000 miles so far, and not a peep.  That's about 4 times as

>I care!  :-)   My car easily produces prodigious velocities -

>Inquiring minds want to know - what's the formula ?

OK, hang on, here we go...

This is really simple, but I'll give you the background so it will
make sense in addition to being useful.  This discussion also assumes
things like no slip occurs between the tire and the road, that a tire's
diameter remains constant as velocity increases, payments do not include
tax, title, and destination charges, you get the picture...   

First off, I measure the *circumference* of my rear tires for these
calculations - don't calculate the circumference using the numbers
on the side of the tire.  What I do is make a mark on the tire and a
corresponding mark on the ground.  Move the car forward or reverse 
until the mark on the tire moves a complete revolution.  Measure this linear
distance and note it.  Do what you have to do to put this linear measurement
into the units of feet.

The way I look at it, the tachometer's measurement is probably pretty
accurate, so let's start there.  OK, the engine is turning some particular
rpm  - the engine is connected to the gearbox so we have to divide the
revolutions of the engine by the gear ratio.  This gives us the revolution of
the output of the gearbox (or the driveshaft on a conventional RWD car).
 This output is then further reduced by the gear reduction of the ring and
pinion gear.  So next divide by the differential ratio.  At this point we
have the rotational speed of the axle/wheel and tire.  Now multiply by the
circumference of the tire (which is essentially feet travelled per
revolution).  The result of all of this is the speed of the car in feet/min.
 Convert this number to miles/hour by dividing by 88.

So anyway, here's the equation:

(RPM x C)/(T x G x 88) = V

Where,

RPM = revolutions per minute of engine
C = circumference of tire in feet
T = transmission ratio  (e.g. .82 for fifth gear in some 911s)
G = ring and pinion ratio (e.g. 3.875 for an "8/31" ring and pinion)
V = speed of vehicle in mph

This formula will let you determine speeds in different gears, etc.

For example, plugging the following info into this equation should yield of
speed of 68.81 mph :

C = 6.414, RPM = 3000, T = .82, G = 3.875.

Sorry if this got kinda long, but I believe things like this mean more if you
know why the formula is the way it is, rather than just knowing the
formula...

Have fun!

re: friend's $250 as-is non-running '80 924 Turbo 

Well, I got the new fuel pump installed, the rodent-chewed line 
from fuel distributor to frequency valve replaced and cranked the
car up Saturday.

There was a strong smell of gas under the hood which took me a while
to find. It turned out to be from the hard gas line up by the wiper
motor. The wiper linkage had rubbed through the steel line just enough
that it was spraying atomized gas up under the cowling. I removed the
bracket holding the lines, cut the gas line at the wear point, slipped
a piece of fuel-injection rubber hose and some clamps on the line and
secured it out of the way.

This was a potentially serious leak that could have caused a fire or
explosion the way it atomized the gas. I don't remember seeing a
recall for this, but it may not have surfaced because of the long time
required to wear through the metal line. I strongly encourage anyone
with a similar age 924 to take a look. All you have to do is remove
the plastic cover over the wiper motor area and make sure that the
wiper linkage isn't rubbing on the fuel line.

engine failure.....one of the connecting rods broke in half and the remaining 
piece still bolted to the crankshaft was turned into a violent "weed-eater" 
and destroyed the case.  It almost cut the case in half!

Since the poor soul doesn't have much cash, I'm looking for a good case for a 
reasonable price.  2.4 and 2.7 preferred.

Thanks,

Allan

I forgot one of the biggest items:  a complete, intact, no cuts/tears/
missing connectors wiring harness for a '70 914. This does NOT include the EFI
wiring harness or breadboard, just the vast loom of wires through the main
body of the car. It *SHOULD* be OK for any early 914, or possiby even for
a 914-6, but I really haven't checked the 'fiche to verify that... $150.

  Thanks for the Leica line info.  Didn't know it existed.  Pricing has not
been addressed yet, still in the very early planning stages.  I do know
there will not be a premimum attached, my guess right now would be MAP.
Another plan has it included in the price of the car for those buying one.
In talking with a local dealer of Porsche, Audi & MB, he is interested in
including it as a bonus from his store, thus your added reason to deal with
him as opposed to another dealer.

	I read (and re-read) this book before I bought my 944 and found it
to be a mine of useful information. If I could only have one 944 book (and
I have > 50 Porsche books in my collection), this would be it. It includes
useful bits of Haynes manual type information with lots of other useful
info on buying and maintaining 924s and 944s.

	Peter is the publications person for Porsche Club Great Britain,
and the magazine which he produces, _Porsche Post_, won the award for the
best club magazine last year. He also co-wrote the 911 Guide to
Restoration with Lindsey Porter.

	There are a couple of minor typos in the book, the one which I
most enjoyed spotting is the dash showing a "turbo boost" gauge which is
acually an "MPG" gauge on an early 85/2 944! I have told Peter about this.

	If only there was a similar book on the 911 (Bruce Anderson's
comes closest).

Having the same color (and problem) I, too, would welcome any words of
wisdom. The basic strategy is: clean, apply color, apply clear, wet sand,
polish.

FWIW, I have gotten a _very_ fine sable brush from a hobby shop (the 4-5 buck
apiece kind) and find that to be pretty effective in letting me apply the
metallic without getting too much in to allow for the clear layer.

A glass fiber brush (try Eastwood) allows you to get all the old wax out, but
will cause a zillion fine scratches in the surface around the chip. Be
gentle, the scratches will polish out when you wet-sand the clear coat flush
with the surrounding finish. Use a sanding block for the wet-sanding so you
don't cause dips in the surface.

All the above notwithstanding, I am seriously considering a repaint of the
front fenders, hood, and nose if I can get convinced anyone has a prayer of
matching a seven year old metallic blue (sigh...).

Up-Fixen Volume III, talked about The Delta Mark 10 unit in two articles
dated 2/68 and 11/69. Does the 1972/73 cars had this same unit?  The fact
that the articles are 3 or 4 years older than the cars makes me skeptical
about the advice.
 
The 2/68 article recommends adding a 47K ohm 2 watt 10% tolerance resistor
in series to the center terminal at the back of the tach.
 
The 11/69 article recommends replacing the factory capacitor from the 2.2
mf. 160 CDV with one of .22 mf 600 CDV.
 
Don't know what the values mean, probably any electronic supply store

Hi, Barry.
 
I agree that the hoops bolted to the suspension are sort of dorky (and I
mistrust the whole lashup) but a car's suspension is well able to take the
weight of the car this way. It's the same sideways load as cornering at 1 g.
 
Also they hopefully tell the prospective home mechanic to drain all fluids

Subject: 911 Door Mirror Wobbles


Hello,

The drivers side door mirror on my 1981 911SC is loose.  It is
the electric/heated mirror style, rectangular, not the newer cone
shaped style.  It wobble very badly when I drive, and I do not want
this to break or worse, fall off.

It is loose where the mirror section attaches to the mirror mounting
base section, and is REALLY loose where the base attaches to the
drivers door itself.  I have tried to tighten the alan/hex head
screw which appears to go from the mirror mounting base into the
door itself, but this does not secure the mirror in place, and is
very tight to turn to begin with.  How do these mirrors attach to
the door?  Do I have to open the door and remove the leather 
interior door panel to get at the attachment mechanism?  Are there
any special tool I need to secure this properly?  I would like to
remove it and clean the threads to the attaching screws, whereever
they may be, since that hex head screw which is right next to the
window, and goes into the door is so tight.  I have a feeling there
may be some corrosion within the parts in the mirror.  The electric
positioing motor still works ok though.  What do I need to watch
out for, besides scratching my new paint job?

Bob,
        I don't know if this is right or not, but this is how I got mine off,
(and back on).  Using the gear puller, as you are, and then applying heat
to the gears only enough that the puller starts doing its job.
        To reassemble I heated the gears and chilled the shaft and the gears
slid right on.
        Again, I am not sure if this is the prefered method.  I don't have
the engine completely back together and running yet, so time will tell.
I waiting for my heads to be finished.
        Hope this helps,
                Tom

Subject: Synthetic Transmission Fluid

I tried Mobil synthetic 75W90 in my 915 a while back and it shifted worse!
It felt like the synchros weren't working as efficiently, as it
would grind more often before going into gear.

I've since gone back to Swepco 201 which makes it shift almost
like a normal transmission.

BTW, remove the fill plug before the drain plug, just in case the
fill plug won't come out... (Tip thanks to Ron Appleton)

Subject: stone chips


Here is some info on repairing rock chips I dug up. I believe it was 
written by John Tilden.  Hope it helps.

My procedure for touching up rock chips etc. is as follows:  

Get a good artists brush approx 1/8" dia, or smaller, better yet get a
selection to suit various chip sizes.  Acquire some lacquer thinner, and a
metal or glass cup to hold a small quantity of same, use to keep the paint
thinned and easy to flow.  I put thinner about 1/8 inch deep in a cofee
mug, and dip brush in thinner prior to dipping into the touch up paint.
Also use edge of cup as you would an artist palette to insure paint
viscosity is correct.  Clean the rock chip with a wax remover or solvent. 
Apply paint to the chipped area in several coats, building up to the level
of the surrounding paint. Let cure thouroghly.  Purchase some 1000 or 1500
grit wet or dry sandpaper, and make a small sanding block out of hard
rubber or wood, approx. size 1"X 1.5".  Wet Sand the projecting surface,
which you have built up, down to the surrounding level. This may require
several itterations to get it flat. Use caution to minimize the orignal
paint material that you sand away. Do not break through the Clear Coat. 
When it is flat, then rub it out with rubbing compound, and polish with
the various grades of Meguiar's polish. Protect the job with a good coat
of wax.  If your hood has a large quantiy of chips, you can fill the voids
as described above, and Wet Sand/Color Sand the entire hood, and polish it
out, in it's entirety, or in smaller areas. I did this to good effect on
my 911. Amazing how much clear coat there is on the contemporary Porsche.

Subject: oil gallery plugs on 914/4 engine cases


	I pulled the transmission on my 914/2.0 last night to investigate
my clutch noises and oil leak. No problems and it only took about an hour.

	The throwout bearing, disk, and pressure plate look like they are
in great shape (they are less than 2 years old). The pressure plate did
have a slight groove in the fingers where the throwout bearing was riding
on it. It wasn't very deep, but it was definitely there... could be the
source of my clutch "grinding" noise which only occured when everything
was cold ?? The throwout was *very* smooth turning, even under load so
I don't understand why there would be a groove on the pressure plate fingers.
If the bearing was old, or if it didn't cost $100, I would replace it 
anyway. But since it is new and expensive to replace I'll use it again.
(Last time I was in here I replaced everything just because I was in the
neighborhood. Don't feel like spending $400 everytime I take something apart.) 
I'm gonna look very carefully at the release fork and allignment to
see if there may have been something strange there.

	When I started to pull the flywheel, I noticed that there was oil
behind the flywheel bolts when I loosened them. There shouldn't be oil
there, should there ???  I pulled off the flywheel and inspected it,
the motor side was covered with oil but the clutch side was still clean.
The tracks from the oil seal were very clean and smooth. I then wiped down
the back of the motor and began looking for the leak. The oil gallery plugs
all look fine with no indication on any leaks there. Sealing them with JB
weld must be a good idea, 'cause it looks like that's what I did 2 years
ago when I was in here last (because of a gallery plug failure). I don't
even remember doing it !  So it looks like the rear flywheel seal must have
been the cause for the leak.... can't find anything else that looks like it
was leaking.

	I had 2 problems, noise from the clutch (only when cold) and an oil
leak. Didn't really find anything wrong. I'll look closer tonight, but for
now it looks like I only need to replace:

	5 flywheel bolts
	1 flywheel lock plate
	1 flywheel dowel pin
	1 rear main seal
	1 pilot bearing
	1 pilot bearing seal
	1 o-ring inside flywheel

	The total should be $30 - $40 

	Am I missing anything ???

							thanks

first off, a disclaimer: i own and maintain a '79 928, and because of

as much as you are here. if my belt fails, i just have a non-runner, if yours
fails, you've got an imported, Porsche-brand wallet sucker (i.e. you're looking
at a head rebuild).

that said: i've used this method on my 928 every time i've had the belt
off (1 replace, 2 cam seal fiasco, 1 water pump fiasco, maybe one other
just for fun). i try to keep a pretty close eye on it, but i've never had any
problems. btw, not that i think this book is worth the paper its

this is the method described in the chilton's 928/924 manual (928/924? what

That's the likely source. It changes the engagement of the throwout bearing.
And it could break due to fatigue. I'd *HIGHLY* recommend replacing the
pressure plate.

There is also a plastic cup that the release fork pivot rides in that tend to
fail due to age and soaking in oil. I'd recommend replacing it. Not hard, and
it makes a HUGE difference in the operation of the clutch.

Nope. That's due to a failed main seal. Need to replace it. Make sure to
use the German seal, not the Brazilian one... And lube the inner surface
very slightly with clean oil before pressing it on.

Other than the pressure plate, no. You're *VERY* lucky that the clutch disk
isn't now oil impregnated. I personally would replace it too, but then,
that's just the way I am...

I need some net wisdom on who builds the most cost effective competition 3
piece wheel (as in strongest, lightest, for least cost).  I am looking at
custom offsets in 16 and 17 inch diameters.  I've called Taylor Corp.
(advertises in SportsCar) on DuraLights, and MRT on their Carbon Fiber
wheels -- although I've heard mixed reviews on the Carbon Fiber wheels
(stress fracturing?).  Any experiences to share?

Subject: Michelin MXV4 tires

Someone recently asked about these tires.  I do not remember the 
application he wanted them for but here are my 2 pennies.  They are 
good.  I have them on my 1985 Mazda 626 with the adjustable suspension, 
15" mag wheels, 195/60HR15 size and the anti-roll bars.  
With the suspension on "Sport" mode, the car does not quite match my 
944S on dry pavement, but the road grip is still ferocious.  With the 
"Normal" suspension setting, the tires still do a great job and are very 
predictable on when they will let go of the road and start sliding.  
On wet pavement they also do great.  I can actually drive the 626 through 
rain, ice or snow with total control of the car until the snow piles up 
so high that the undercarriage of the car is gliding on top of the snow  
(and then I lose control completely).  Most of the cars I know of simply 
do not have this kind of all-weather drivability.  And yes, BMWs, Mercs, 
Acuras have been wearing these tires for a long time.  The older models 
probably have the MXV3s which are almost as good as the MXV4s but are not 
4-season tires.

BBS. There's NO contest. They get it right, every time. Lots of people
I know have tried to cut corners and buy cheaper stuff, and have wound
up with wheels they can't use. Paid for, mind you, but can't use.

BTW, have you seen the adpater kits that let you use centerlock wheels on
your 911 without having to convert all the hubs to centerlock? That might
be worth looking at, since you can then look at some of the used BBS
competition wheels available from retired Camel Lights cars...

Anyway, I still have a 911-size space saver spare tire, unused, NOT on a rim
(that's why I have it to begin with -- I needed the rim). It's a Vredestein

my information of from inspection of the combustion chambers, and from
*carefully* rotating the camshaft with a piston at TDC. i suppose its possible
that there could be large enough tolerances in the rod bearings that, at speed,
the effective length of the rod could be enough longer to let them 
touch. i really
don't know.

 hey guys! how big are rod bearing clearances anyway? enough
that the dynamic case is significantly different from the static case?

Subject: 40 Webers on a 356 - HELP !

I've got a problem and could really use some help. I've been restoring this
59 Convertible D for 5 years now and it's almost ready to go. But I *CANT*
get the motor to run well - or to run at all.

I pulled off the Zeniths and replaced them with 40IDF Webers. Plugs foul
almost immediately and it runs like sh_t!! The top gasket on the carbs turns
up soaked with gas each time I look. It's obviously way too rich but I can't
figure out why!

Here's all the things I've done.


     1. I've checked and rechecked, set and reset, the float levels
     2. I've checked the jet size stampings against the Haynes manual - all
            OK (I haven't actually measured the jets)
     3. I've checked the fuel pump pressure - OK at about 1.75 psi
     4. I've gone to a Permatune ignition, checked cap, rotor, timing etc.
         and, of course, changed trhe plugs several times - staying with
         the standard plug
     5. I've checked valve adjustment and compression - all OK.

I would bet I've missed something stupid. Can you help put this pretty
silver tub back on the road?? Do you have any experience with Webers on a
356??

United Speedo 800-877-4798

FYI, VDO engineers gave me formulas to calculate input frequencies 
to the speedo guage and were very helpful.  They referred to the 
P# and K# on the front of the guage for calculating freq.
I never followed-up due changing jobs and loosing access to test

Someone else on the list asked me this question recently.  I think he was

HRE wheels successfully for the last two years.

As Stan mentioned, you cannot go wrong with BBS.  If the availability and

we're happy with the HRE's.  But I'm no expert on these matters.

This is in fact true: on the early 928's, you can apparently lose the timing
belt without acquiring a set of sixteen lawn darts.

BTW, a friend lost the belt on his '86 944 Turbo a few years ago.  Didn't
bend any valves.  Someone from PCNA told him there was a 3% chance
of that happening.

Subject: 951 idle problems


I've avoided asking anything about this for awhile now because I
kept thinking I would be able to find the problem.  As it turns
out, I'm at a loss.

I have a fluctuating idle problem on my '89 944 Turbo.  It has been
doing this for a couple months now and seems to be getting worse.

The idle is supposed to be 840 +/- 40 rpm.  When I start the car 
cold it idles really rough around 800-900 rpm.  As it warms up, it
likes to increase to about 1000-1200 rpm.  Sometimes I'll catch
it around 1600 rpm.  It will maintain the high idle even when I blip
the gas.  

When I let off and declutch to shift (neutral) the engine rpm drops
very slowly as opposed to how fast the tach needle should normally
drop.  Often, the engine speed is higher than the transmission when
upshifting causing the car to jump when the clutch is engaged (you
normally dont have to feather the clutch when shifting from 3rd to
4th).

Recently, when letting off with the car still in gear, it will lug
while idling down.  Other than these problems, it runs great.  It
has power, and except when idling @ 1600rpm at a stop light, does
not run hot.


I've checked the obvious.  I've done enough work on the car to feel
pretty knowledgable with routine maintenance.  I cannot find any
vacuum leaks, no holes in the induction systems, no loose hose clamps.
I've also readjusted the idle per factory manual specifications.

Is it possible that the electronic idle controller/sensor is failing?
Any other possibilities?

Thank you for your time.

Hi,

Last Saturday at 2am my '83 911 suddently wouldn't start; it has cold started
just fine since I bought it 6 months ago.

I rolled it down a hill trying to jump start it. It rolled about 150 feet
in 2nd gear at 1500-2000 rpm but *wouldn't start*!
It was about 45 degrees out and a bit damp.

The next morning at 9am it was still a bit damp, but maybe 55 degrees.
The car started immediately the first time I turned the key.

This morning it started fine too, though it was again maybe 55 degrees out.

All of this suggests to me that the cold-start injector works OK. The CD
ignition unit was whistling, the fuel pump worked because I could smell gas
after cranking it over for a while.

What happened?

Thanks in advance!
Stefan

> 912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
>           in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
>           1970.
Actually 1966-69, right?  At least those were the model years, no?

> 914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
>            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
>            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
>            of the four-cylinder engine.
The 914/6 had Porsche brakes too, and was assembled by Porsche.
Is that noteworthy?

Hmmmm. They're not DOT approved, so if you have an accident and wheel
failure could possibly be a problem, you may have your insurance company
crawl up your butt and die, but other than that, they could be used...
The other problem is that you typically see centerlocks in like 10"

My 914 was originaly a 1.8L model but was replaced with a 2.0L engine by one of

Subject: RE: 951 idle problems


Jim,

There are a number of things to check for this sort of behaviour.

1. Vacuum leaks.  You've already done so.  I assume that you
have checked the intake manifold gasket and lower injector
o-rings, which very often develop leaks.

2. Idle stabilizer.  Despite the ostensible factory test procedure,
there is no really good test of how well the thing is working.
Porsche even says this in their literature.

3. Oxygen sensor.  An old sensor gets "lazy," by which I mean
that it responds slowly to exhaust changes.  I suppose that
you could test the sensor with a VOM or oscilloscope on its
output plus a Sun analyzer on your car's CO test pipe.  But
I've never done this.

4. Basic mixture.  Running too rich a mixture will also cause
the symptoms you describe.  With that Sun anaylzer hooked up,
you want to see 0.6% CO at the test pipe, with lambda unplugged.
Should drop to about half that value with the lambda sensor
reconnected.  I have found that my own car, a 944S, is rather
suprisingly sensitive to this setting.  Idled like pooh when it was
a little high a few months back, like 0.8%.

5. You should also check the air flow meter.  I have found that
you cannot do it with an ohm meter.  You need to do as the
workshop manual suggests: look for the right signal voltage
at its output plug, at the limits of travel.  Also look for nasty
discontinuities in the signal as you sweep the barn door.

Hope this helps.

Hi, Art.
 
(ADVISORY -- I'm afraid this is not going to be very helpful if you insist
on using Webers.)
 
Webers can be made to work on the 356, but I don't see the point. I'm sure
Pellow will chime in with his recommendations, if so you might as well try
those as he seems to like Webers, but IMHO you would be infinitely better off
using Solexes like God and Prof. Porsche intended. 1) they're easy enough to
work on; 2) they will make more power. ("What? Did he really say that? Humble
Solexes make more power than the trick aftermarket Webers?") Yup. If I
remember right, the Webers have 40 mm butterflies and 27 mm venturis. The
Solexes have 40 and 32, respectively. Guess which flows more air. Webers are
good for engines that make torque at low rpm but no top end power; they
choke at high flow rates. People THINK the engine has more power because its
torque curve has shifted to low rpm, but that's entirely subjective.
 
Solex drawbacks -- if you did any major power increases/cam or head or
intake system work, you might have to search a bit to find appropriate jets,
or get creative with Mikuni parts or the jet drill/ream tools. So far, I've
had to do neither. And they have gotten an undeserved bad reputation for
throttle shaft leaks but Eurometrix in California does a SUPER job on
reconditioning them.
 
Does the Haynes manual give jet sizes for WEBERS? (I don't use Haynes, so I
don't know) or does it give jet sizes for Solexes? They don't translate...
If you are setting up your Webers using a table of Solex jet sizes, that
may be your problem right there.

                 SP2 Nodes Arrive at the Theory Center


NOTE: The following is a news release from Cornell Theory Center.

                                  ----

  Ithaca, N.Y. -- On October 25 the Cornell Theory Center received delivery
of the world's fastest, most powerful general purpose computer -- a
massively parallel IBM Scalable POWERparallel Systems SP2. Capable of
performing 136 billion calculations per second, the supercomputer consists
of 512 high performance processors that can all work in tandem on a
problem, making possible a new era in computational science.

  Cornell's IBM SP2 performs work in one second that is equivalent to the
output of 3,500 mathematicians, each making one complex calculation per
minute for 73 years.

  "We know that national and global leadership in high technology is the best
way to ensure a vibrant economy for New Yorkers," said Governor Mario Cuomo.
"This delivery enhances Cornell as a premier facility for supercomputing and
provides researchers with still more tools as we push the horizons of our
knowledge and expertise."

  The UNIX-based, 512-node IBM POWERparallel SP2 enables scientific
numerically-intensive, high performance computing as well as the intensive
data analysis processing of very large databases usually associated with
commercial computing. The SP2 goes beyond number crunching -- it enables
applications that take on the characteristics of commercial computing,
primarily the mining of large databases -- which are now increasingly
important for the scientific community. This is made possible by the system's
flexibility, raw horsepower and global scalability -- or ability for the
system's power, input/output devices, internal memory, and storage to all
grow, or scale, together.

  Even the performance of smaller POWERparallel systems has been impressive.
In the most recent NAS benchmarks, IBM's 64-node POWERparallel system
outperformed all similarly configured competitive systems.

  The SP2's parallel processing design links together from two to hundreds of
IBM's POWER RISC processors to perform computations. The processors work on
different parts of a problem at the same time, enabling the supercomputer to
analyze massive amounts of data too bulky for a mainframe, and at blazing
speeds. The SP2 is not an experimental machine, but rather a production-class
system that can be used for work ranging from cutting-edge science to
everyday UNIX applications.

  "IBM has provided us with the technology that will help us assume a world
leadership position in computational science," said Malvin Kalos, Director,
Cornell Theory Center. "The SP2 will allow us to create applications never
before dreamed both in terms of classical science, such as weather
forecasting and material design, and emerging applications that combine
numerical and data processing. Applications that were imagined, but not
feasible due to the time it would take to run them, are now real."

  The Cornell Theory Center, which is the first customer to receive an IBM
POWERparallel system after its introduction in February 1993, has been a
long-term partner with IBM in the development and testing of high-performance
computers. Besides IBM, businesses large and small have joined a Corporate
Research Institute to access the Theory Center's computing, training and
consulting resources. Partners also benefit from research collaborations with
the Theory Center's staff and with Cornell University's world-class faculty.
One such partner is Corning, Inc., which is conducting research on the
properties of glass and other materials.

  The power of the SP2 combined with algorithms developed jointly at Corning,
Inc. and the Cornell Theory Center have allowed the modeling of materials
with thousands of atoms in an industrial setting -- something that was
previously impossible. This ability is also exciting for the modeling of
biological materials.

  "This is the only approach currently known that will handle thousands of
atoms for millions of time steps," said Michael Teter, Cornell Adjunct
Professor of Physics and Corning Engineering Fellow. "Researchers are coming
close to observing many of the mysteries involved in glass chemistry which
have not been well understood for over 2,000 years."

  Other applications that will take advantage of the POWERparallel system
include such classic computational science research as simulating low-
density, nonequilibrium gas flows for aerospace engineers, exploring the
properties of matter that existed at the beginning of the universe, or
understanding the molecular mechanisms of cellular processes -- especially
proteins and neurotransmitters -- in order to design more effective drugs.

  "Our partnership with the Cornell Theory Center is helping us to determine
just how much this powerful system will accomplish," said Irving Wladawsky-
Berger, general manager, IBM POWER Parallel Systems. "I am sure that
unanticipated technological innovations will result through the cross-over of
the technical world into the business arena as these communities increasingly
interact and learn from each other as practiced at the Cornell Theory
Center."

  The SP2 system will have 48 wide nodes and 464 thin nodes. Wide nodes will
have between 128 megabytes (MB) and two gigabytes (GB) of memory. The thin
nodes will have 128 MB of memory. All nodes that will be used for computation
will have at least two GB of disk space. Some of the wide nodes will have
eight GB of disk space. The peak performance expected is 136 gigaflops
calculated as 266 megaflops per node.

  The SP2 has two types of thin nodes which offer an attractive price/
performance ratio. One uses the IBM POWER Architecture and the other the
more powerful POWER2-based microprocessors. Both thin node types are
identical in internal memory, from 64 to 512 MB, have one to nine gigabytes
(GB) of internal disk storage and have four connectivity slots.

  Wide nodes offer exceptional performance, extensive storage and
communications and are based on POWER2 microprocessors. These nodes have
seven slots for I/O and network attachments for a broader choice in
connectivity options, up to 18 GB of internal disk storage and up to two GB
of memory per node, providing very high compute capacity, greater memory
and wider bandwidth.

It has centerlock wheels and is apparently DOT approved; it's licensed
for street driving. Note that his centerlocks have a safety retaining snap
ring to prevent the nut from loosening.

Since BBS wheels are 3 piece, couldn't one replace the center sections
with standard 5 lug ones? If you bought the wheels cheaply enough, I
suppose this could be cost effective. You could also mix and match
the rim parts to get the widths and offsets you want.

I assume that assembling 3 piece wheels is a job only for qualified
individuals/shops. I imagine that truing and dynamic balancing are
part of the assembly process.

BTW, I see adds for Hartmann International wheels. Is this the OEM

I agree, let common sense should be your guide.  I've heard stories of two 
people getting different results on the same car using the same meter.  How 
far apart they were I don't know.  I've never used a meter myself, so I 
can't vouch from first hand experience.  Technique could be a variable as 
could the calibration of the meter.

I replaced the belt in my 928 myself using a Chilton book as a guide. 
  Chilton advises to tighten the belt on a 928 until you can "just" twist it 
a quarter turn.  Of course the strength of the person could be a big 
variable here.  Use common sense.  I checked it after 5,000 and 25,000 miles 
and it was still close to that, so I let it be.  Put over 40,000 on it the 
past two years with no problems.

I had the belt changed last month while having some leaking cam oil seals 
replaced, but this time had a dealer do it due to a lack of free time. 
 Mechanic told me the belt still looked in good shape when he pulled it out. 
 Guess I must have been very close to the ideal tension.

A meter is probably the most accurate way of checking tension.  If I had to 
worry about my valves slapping pistons (not a problem on my 2 valve USA 
928), I would probably want the re-assurance of a meter.  Especially on my 
first belt change.  I also would give the belt a quarter turn to see if 
"feels" right as a double check.

That's not QUITE the point, rather that when you trash one racing,
you don't necessarily have to buy a whole wheel, just th epart that got

          SUBJECT:   911 Ignition Miss
 
 
What would cause a 1972 911T to start to have a bad miss overnight?  Two
weeks ago, I drove the car all day while working a road rally as the tail
car, and the car drove fine.  This pass week, the only parts that I put on
the car, was a new rev limiting rotor from Stoddard, and a new air hose
from the warm start valve to the air cleaner.  The only other replacement
was several weeks ago, to have the distributor removed and the vacuum
advance fixed.  The car did not show any problems after the distributor
was put back it.  The only other items of interest.
 
        The distributor shaft will rotate about 20 degrees how much
            movement should there be?
 
        I checked the timing, and the gap and dwell of the points, they
            check out OK, still, could the points have gone bad.
 
        Maybe one of the spark plugs have gone bad.  It has the expensive
            Bosch plugs in it.  I could throw some cheap plugs in it to
            see if the miss disappears, then I would know how many
            expensive plugs to buy.
 
        I adjusted the valves several months ago, since then I changed the
            oil from 20w50, to 10w40, I know that the valves need to be
            adjusted about every 3,000 miles, if they were out of
            adjustment would it clause such a bad miss?
 
        Rotor Cap, plug wires, plug boots?,   I did eyeball everything and
            it looks correct.
 
 
Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Subject: Re: 40 Webers on a 356

Dear Peter:

      Yes, that's right- I DO like Webers!  (And the 40IDF Webers have 28mm
Venturis, not the 27mm you mentioned). I also like good-running Solexes too,
although that's almost an oxymoron these days, though after we rebuild the
 Solexes, replacing the throttle shafts, adding bronze bushings and
(sometimes) reboring the throttle body and putting in oversize butterflies,
and machining all the mating surfaces after thoroughly cleaning out all the
passageways, THEN  Solexes seem to work pretty well.

     Webers have Ball Bearings supporting their throttle shafts which is why
you never have to worry much about Weber throttle shaft problems. 

    And changing Main Jets/Air Correction Jets and Emulsion Tubes are a Joy
with Webers. With Solexes,. changing a main jet means that the entire
contents of the float bowl pours out all over your nice sheet metal (it is
nice,isn't it?). Changing the Air Correction Jet in a Solex involves taking
the top off. And we won't even mention what you must do to change the
emulsion tube on a Solex.
   With a Weber,  all the above is on a jet stack that comes out in 5 seconds
with a screwdriver (or a dime), withOUT leaking gas all over everything and
possibly burning your baby (and/or your house) down.
    Yes the 40IDF Webers have smaller venturis that the Solex 40PII's, but
you can put 32mm venturis into the Webers or you can go to 44IDF Webers that
come with 36mm venturis if you REALLY want high end power. (And having built
many 356/912 engines with 44IDF Webers- they REALLY go- and at High RPM the
44IDF's give you the Sound of a Ferrari at < 1% of the cost!

    Oh, and  lest we forget, God and Dr Porsche DID use Webers on Porsches-
Webers on 356 Carrera 4-Cams and, of course, on 911's.

 Just my $.02.

  KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!

Alright, This year I've already replaced my motormounts, water pump,
belt tensioner, and put new belts on my 84 944 with 60K miles on it.
(this fine car has sucked at least $2k out of my wallet this year).
  I just went in for my 2K mile belt re-tension, and guess what, now
I'm told the front engine seals are leaking oil, as is the cam tower.
(and the oil is getting on the belts).

Is this a common failure for 944's?  They have this work as taking 16 hours
(so for a total cost over $1k, it is nearly all labor, virtually no new 
parts).

Subject:  Help indentify 914 wheels?

This may be a long shot, but I'll ask anyway.
I am wondering who is the manufacturer of the Riviera style wheels on my '75 914.
I examined one of the wheels and all I could find was "PD2242" stamped on the
back of one of the spokes.  These wheels were on the car when I bought
it back in '86 and they didn't look new then, so they were probably manufactured
sometime from the mid '70s to early '80s.  Any ideas?  Could they have been added
by the dealer when the car was originally sold?  The car also has a hood badge which
I understand a lot of dealers added.

Pete, these wheels were very popular in the late '70s and '80s as 
aftermarket VW wheels.  Every magazine I have from that era has pages and 
pages of ads for them.  Somewhere I have the actual manufacturer from 
when I was trying to get a set of 14" ones for my van. (I was a silly 
person back then!!!) I will try to dig up the info.  That's all I can 
remember.
Later,
Don

Subject: 40 Webers on a 356

 
First of all, an apology to the list -- I seem to have activated the Pellow
Smokescreen Machine again. Oh well, things have been getting boring since
the departure of The T*D. No, I promise, no more flame wars. This is it.
 
The point to remember here is that Art Lustgarten asked for help in getting his
Webers working on his Convertible D. I am unable to help with Weber jets,
but pointed out that Pellow would probably be able to help as he likes the
things. That was a hint; Pellow, why don't you tell the man what jets to put
in his Webers as a baseline? The Solex baseline is covered in the manual; here
are the jets as given in the B/C Supplement, page NK9, for the Solex 40
PII-4, 1600 Super 90:
 
venturi 32
main jet 115
air correction jet 180
idle jet 57.5
idle air bleed 1.8
accelerator pump number 72
pump jet 50
power jet nozzle: tall, with 0.4 restrictor
needle valve (with spring) 175
float weight 7.4 g
emulsion tube number 25
main jet carrier 6
bypass bores 1.7/1.4/1.0
warm weather accelerator pump volume 0.45 cc per nozzle, 2 squirts
cold weather 0.65 cc per nozzle, 2 squirts
 
Again, if Mr. Lustgarten is getting his jet information out of a Haynes
manual, is it really Weber jetting or is he reading Solex jets and trying to
make a Weber work with those sizes? That's not legit. (I knew somebody
who tried to navigate through Phoenix with a map of Albuquerque. When this was
pointed out to him, he replied that "all these Western towns are built alike.")
 
>The 40 IDF Webers have 28 mm venturis, not the 27 mm you mentioned)
In my original reply I said I THINK the Webers have 27 mm venturis;
Pellow's pointing out that they have indeed 28s doesn't change the fact that
they're still smaller than stock Solexes at 32 and therefore are more
restrictive. We are talking about the man's Weber 40 IDFs, the same carbs
Pellow recommends for 356s, not 44s. While 32 mm venturis may be available, I
suspect that these are seldom installed in the 356 Weber conversions. One
would lose all that low end torque which equals imaginary horsepower to the
customer.
 
>After we rebuild the Solexes...
Pellow sends his Solexes to Eurometrix, just like everybody else.
 
>Webers have ball bearings
So? Just about all the carbs ever built have solid bearings and do
just fine; tired 30-year-old Solexes after you rebush and rebuild them do
fine too.
 
>With Solexes, changing a main jet means that the entire contents of the
>float bowl pours out all over your nice sheet metal
OK, Einstein, if the contents pour out, how can you prevent this? TIME'S UP!
Use a syringe to empty the float bowl through the vent opening BEFORE
you take out the main jet carrier.
 
It's easier to change jets on Webers because you HAVE to change jets on
Webers. Otherwise the world would have no need for old Ferrari mechanics.
Fiddling with the damn things for days on end to get them to work (when you
don't have baseline jet information) is part of the fun, you see. Just like
owning a British car but without the stigma (or oil stains, which may be the
same thing).
 
>Changing the air correction jet in a Solex involves taking the top off.
Wrong. You have to take air cleaners off, no big deal. The air correction
jets are accessible from the top of the Solex, without further disassembly.
They poke through holes in the top cover. With velocity stacks, you may
have to take those off if clearances are tight, and you can't fish your
screwdriver in there, but you can clearly see the air jets, even read their
size, with stacks in place if you have those.
 
>God and Dr. Porsche did use Webers...
The subject was pushrod 356s, not Carreras, not 911s. We didn't mention
mechanical fuel injection for 356s either (yes, it did exist -- factory
prototype.)
 
Back to the point, Pellow, give us facts, don't waste our time with the
flames -- TELL THE MAN WHAT JETS TO PUT IN HIS WEBERS SO HE CAN DRIVE
AGAIN !!! You're the self-appointed Weber on 356 expert, so demonstrate your
expertise not by nitpicking 27 vs. 28 mm venturi size in my post but by
helping Art Lustgarten instead.

Subject: 911 front end hiss

I did some work on my 87 911 carerra the other day and after completing 
the work test drove the car and then crawled around for  while to
check everthing seemed OK.  While doing so I noticed a kind of hissing
sound from the fron end of the car.

I never noticed this before.  Can anyone lay my mind to rest as to
whether this is normal ?

The sound seems to be coming slightly more from the left than the right
and seems to be right around where the front axle is.  Note, the tires
are not losing pressure as far as my tire guage can tell.  Plus the
sound is only there when the engine is running, so I think I can
safely discount the tires as a source for the hissing.

Thanks for any help,
Richard Hocking.

If valves were going to meet pistons on a US model 2 valve 928 I would know! 
 My belt went and I cranked the engine a good amount trying in vain to 
restart it.

The Porsche mechanic that did my belt told me that the valves will clear the 
pistons on the 2 valve "US" model 928.  This is due to the lower compression 
on the US models.  The Euro spec model & all the 4 cylinder water cooled 
models WILL bend valves due to higher compression.  My guess is the pistons 
on the Euro 928 models are domed to increase the compression.

This collaborates what another Porsche mechanic told me previously.  I may 
not have all the HP of the Euro or 4 valve models, but for this peace of 
mind I can bear it.  Since you also have an '84, you too can relax!

I've seen pictures in the shop manual, but that's it.  It's high cost is no 
doubt related to the high cost of the marque.  Perhaps also to discourage 
shade tree mechanics?

The liability would no doubt scare any small outfit away.  I'd bet a good 
many Porsches are owned by lawyers!  But with all the belt driven cars 
around these days (from all manufactures), I wonder if there is some 
universal tension tool made with other cars in mind.  Is Porsche the only 
car manufacturer that specifies a tension tool?  What procedure do other 
manufacturers like Audi or Toyota specify?

Yep, common problem. 16 hours sounds a bit high. I did a friends in 5 hours,
including a trip to the dealer to pick up a missing seal.

Parts cost should be around $120 for all of the seals, including the front
crankshaft to oilpump seal.

  OFFICE MEMO         912 Body & paint?s                    Date:  11/9/94

Hello all
I want to paint our 68 912 and having various minor dents removed.  A friend
of mine suggested that I remove all of the trim, bumpers etc... by myself to
save money. rather than pay somebody $50/hour to do it.  Questions; what is
the relative difficulty of doing this? any special tools required?  Do all of
the windows need to come out? I plan on replacing rubber seals, especially
around the little winglette windows.
I live in the Los Angeles area, specifically Torrance.  Does anybody
recommend a particular paint and body shop to help me with this?  Also, what
should I expect to pay?  What kind of paint should I use? avoid?
TIA
Keith

For my '69 912 with split-shafted Solexes that need rebushing, rebuilding
and many parts replaced (specifically, the split-shaft adjustment parts are
worn and frozen), it will cost me about $700 to get my Solexes back in
shape ($380 to Eurometrix for rebushing, another $300-400 to replace those
worn parts).  My solid-shaft Solexes on the shelf aren't much better.

I'm leaning towards 40IDF Webers and 32mm venturis, seeing that there are
many good sources (I'm heavily considering PMO).  But, does anyone do a
44IDF kit for 356/912 that works for comparable money?

This is not _strictly_ a dollars and cents issue for me, but a dollars and 
_sense_ issue.  My 912 is a daily driver, and I'm looking for a carburetor
solution that will last for a long time.

Thoughts?

Doug:  Yes, It's for real, sorta.  I called the owner, Steve  Long, nice guy.  
Palo Alto is on the way home (sorta) so went buy to check it out.  Here's the 
details:  Car is yellow, was probably originally silver, didn't chk codes.  
Steve has had it for 10 years and uses it as a daily driver back and forth to 
work.  Looks like it's been ridden hard but not put away wet.  It's very 
presentable from the outside, floor pans and battery box look ariginal and are 
solid except for some very small holes in battery box.  Some rust bubbles in 
door bottoms but not very bad.  Some bubbles in front fender behind wheels but 
again very minor.  Body is very solid and with "normal" minor rust.  Bumpers, 
bumper guards and overiders in excellent shape,no dents,  most chrome is good. 
 Chrome rims with moons look pretty good.  Some minor dings but overall 
straight body. 
 
Inside is stock including orig. radio (works), yucky under dash cassette 
player but no damage to dash on installation.  Needs an interior redo though 
orig. headliner is usable. Dash pad good, needs seat covers and carpets and 
door panels. 
 
mechanicals:  He's put 90K on a rebuild done before he got it.  It appears to 
be totally stock, carbs etc.  Looks like it's got 90K on it but nothing goofy 
ever done to it.  Engine compartment looked good and with a little spit and 
polish the motor could look great.  Sheet metal was excellent and I'm not a 
concours judge but it looked tres stock. We went for a little drive....tranny 
is tight and quiet, shifts easily and no howls, moans or clunks from the drive 
line.  Motor smokes a little and is tired but no knocks or skips.  Brakes need 
a little work.  Could be an adjustment, don't pull, don't pump up but are low. 
 Do stop the car with no grinding noises.  Wouldn't be too worried about 
driving this baby across the country. Rumbles right along at 60 mph.  Owner 
changes the oil and adjusts the valves every 3K. 
 
This would be a solid car to restore or drive daily and redo bit at a time.  
Heater boxes worked fine, front end felt good, even the schocks were liveable. 
Tempted myself but have too full a garage now..... 
 
Oh, by the way, Steve is selling it because he upgraded to a much more modern 
Pcar.  He got a good deal on a 67 912 coupe!  Give him a call if you're 
interested.  I told him I'd pass info on to "friends". Didn't have time to 
explain pfiles.

sealing surface. I plan to measure out everything before I  press the new 
seal to assure that the seal only contacts on the flat hub and not on the
radius or on the flywheel face. The seal is supposed to be pressed flush
to the back of the case or is it recessed by some amount ?

	Also, the crank end play should be set at .004" ? Adding shim thickness
increases end play, decreasing shim thickness decreases end play ? As I think
about this it seems as though the seal has to contact the radius and that
the end play adjustment determines the force which is exerted on the radius...
Is this correct, or am I confused ? 

Old seal also said "SABO" on it. This is portuguese for Lucus, right ?  :-)

Craig, you actually have the best of both worlds. The 1.8 injection system
is, IMHO, far superior to the system found on both the 1.7 and 2.0 cars.
The 1.8 uses a process called AFC or Air Flow Controlled. This is much more
"real world" than the 1.7-2.0, in that it bases its metering on the volume
of air flowing through the throttle body, rather than the amount of vacuum
inside the throttle body. It is a very close relative to the system in
present use on 911 cars.

On my old race car, I swapped out a 1.8 engine and put in a 2.0. I really
wanted to keep the old FI system, but the PCA Parade and Racing rules said
that would be a no no in stock classes.

I think, (oh God, here come the flames) that the '76 912E used a setup
exactly like the one you have now.

Unless you're planning on racing or autocrossing in a stock class, keep
what you have and enjoy.

I would think that centerlock wheels can be used legally for street 
applications.  It's just the question of whether one is willing to spend 
all that cash just to convert from the five bolt to centerlock.  I read 
in the Excellence magazine from a few months ago of the price of 
conversion for a 3.8 RSR from the regular five bolt to the centerlock 
wheel and the price, if I remember correctly, was astronomical.  Of 
course that car also had the air jack system built-in and also the 
gentleman bought the pneumatic air guns needed for quick change for the 
centerlock wheels.

	Here's what I learned about the belts and tensioning.  A local

Subject: RE: Radio Transmitters in Porsches?


     I have an amateur radio license and have operated on 2m and 440MHz in 
both my '89 944 and '81 Rabbit.  I may not be much of a help on the 944 
since I haven't installed an antenna on that car and only use a handheld 
Yaesu.  My Rabbit has a 2m-1/2wave/70cm-collinear Larsen glass mount antenna 
(about 39" tall if my memory and math is right--looks like a long cell-phone 
ant.).  Its mounted on the back-hatch but is offset due to the rear wiper. 
 However, it still transmits/receives just fine.  Its been through one 
winter and summer here in Indiana and hasn't fallen off yet.
     I've thought about putting one on the 944, however I don't want to mess 
up the lines with an antenna (my FM antenna is in the windshield).  I have 
also considered a rather expensive mount made by diamond that might fit on 
the upper lip of the hatch.  It may interfere when you open the hatch, 
though.  I have also considered using the hole where the rear windshield 
wiper installs in the glass.  I think some connector/mounts may fit that 
hole, but I'm not sure whether the glass would crack.  I've seen one 944 
employ this tactic.  I wouldn't consider a magnetic mount for obvious 
reasons, and I certainly wouldn't drill any holes in the sheetmetal.

Just some thoughts,

   I had recently acquired a 1980 930 with a slant-nose conversion

except for the right retractable headlight which is stuck in a half-open

Subject: Re: Radio Transmitters in Porsches?


I'm posting my reply to the entire list because I want 944
owners to know that there's a wonderful solution to the "Where
do I put the antenna?" problem.

A friend of mine noticed some years ago that 944s--or at least
some model years?--have ski-rack bolts under the hatches up
near the roof. He made up an aluminum mount that bends in ways
I can't quite describe, but the net result is a small horizontal
platform (about 3 inches square) in which one can cut a hole for
an antenna mount. Mine holds a 1/4-wave 2-meter whip just fine;
the aluminum wobbles a bit when I put the 5/8-wave antenna on,
but I've driven hundreds and hundreds of miles that way and
the aluminum hasn't broken yet.

Just stare at the bolts for a while and think about how to
get from the angle of the hatch to horizontal, and you can
probably figure out how to cut and bend the aluminum.

The coax from the underside of the horizontal mount then just
drops through the hatch and into the car. Yes, it's put a bit
of a dent in the rubber around the hatch, but no leaks so far,
and it's been five years.

BTW, I either run a handy-talky (2 watts) or a Kenwood 7650
mobile rig (10 watts) on 2 meters. Haven't tried HF (where
would I put a big antenna??) or UHF.

The American Radio Relay League (the biggest ham organization
in the U.S.) did a survey of vehicle manufacturers on radio
installation and published the results a few months ago in
their magazine _QST_, which is available in many libraries.
I have a copy of the letter from Porsche somewhere; I'll try
to find it and post it. Basically, they said "Don't do it,"
but many manufacturers say that to head off complaints. I"ve
never had any problems.

>>      7) Method of mounting for both radio and antenna
            Well, the radio was the easy part.  When I use the CB, I
            remove the pocket that's under the radio, and use some
            aluminum "L" brackets to mount the unit to the screws that
            help hold in the center console.  I haven't run the power
            or antenna leads into it yet, but I will soon have these
            waiting under the bucket for a quick and easy install

            As mentioned above, I've gone for the antenna through the
            whole in the rear hatch glass.  I use a connector for
            mounting to sheet metal, along with a spacer (the hole is
            bigger than the shaft) a pair of stainless washers (one
            on each side of the glass) that sandwich a pair of
            plumbing washers to seal out the elements.  Oh yeah,
            there's a lockwasher inside the hatch to keep the rattles
            from undoing everything, too.  Normally, I have a black 
            weather cap and weather donut that look like a slightly 
            "pumped up" version of the stock plug.  When I install 
            the antenna, I attach a good length of antenna cable to
            the inside and using an angle adapter mount a firestik on
            the outside.  Not exactly "stock" lines, but it sure works
            nice.  As for the glass cracking, I haven't had any
            problems.  I've only run this around town a few times 
            (stays put upto 90mph in fairly calm winds) and survived
            a trip from San Diego to Las Vegas (300+ miles) without
            any problems.  I plan on using just this setup for the
            Monte Carlo rally my wife and I are entered in in Dec.

You install it until the special seal seating tool has bottomed out. Part
is T-34D, about $50 at most VW supply places. Get one. Or borrow one. But
use one.

You're exactly backwards. There are *THREE* shims. There *MUST* be
three shims. The simple way to do this is install two (use your old
bolts), measure the endplay, and then calculate the thickness the
third is required to be to get 0.004". (i.e.it must be <gapsize> - 0.004)
If you can't get the right endplay that way, you may need to swap one of
the other shims.

through-the-glass type, which I located to the right of the third brake
light (but not so close that I cannot replace the brake light bulb).

I ran the antenna wire through the headliner and down the A pillar,
under the trim.  This required a little creativity at the top of the A
pillar trim, but worked out OK.

The CB transmitter, a Cobra, is mounted vertically under the dash
in the passenger footwell.  Out of sight, and out of the way of
passengers' feet.  I fashioned a bracket from a length of aluminum
flat stock.  One end of the bracket is attached to one of the ABS
control unit mounting studs (I don't have ABS in the car), the other
to a spare stud which is under the right side fresh air vent.

Locating the CB there let me daisy-chain a +12 line from the radio.
It is otherwise pretty hard to pick up the radio power circuit, which
is different from the 30, 15, and X circuits in that it is switched on at
all times except when the key is at the "off" position.  For example,
most accessory circuits are not powered during engine cranking.

I hate drilling holes in my car.  So I located the handset cradle on
another short piece of flat stock.  The top of the strip has a hole
drilled in it, and slips between the right edge of the centre console
and the carpet, and is "piggybacked" on the trim screw which
is already there.  (Is this explanation understandable?)

Net result is that all you see is the antenna and the cradled
handset.  No cables, no transmitter box. The handset comes out
in about ten seconds for those all-important track events.

Borrowed a VSWR meter (sp?) from a friend at a local TV station to
adjust the trim in the antenna.  It makes a difference.

Hope this helps.

Kevin

Subject: 911 Torsion bar tube

I'm new to this group and was wondering if anyone might be able to help me
out.....

I have a 1968 911L that I purchased roughly a year ago. The car is in really
good shape ie. no rust, however I had to put it away early this fall as a
result of a broken torsion bar tube. The tube which houses the torsion bars
has a crack between the dimple for the transmission and the closest banana
arm mount. The crack runs about 3/4 of the way around the circumference of
the tube. The crack itself is clean and rust free which leads me to assume
that it is a result of stress and/or fatigue. The tube has not been broken
all of the way, as soon as I noticed it I stopped driving the car. I
understand that replacing the tube is a great undertaking....an undertaking
that is quite impossible here in my neck of the woods due to a lack of
qualified and experienced companies that due work to Porsches. I would like
to repair what I have since it has not broken all the way, does anyone have
any suggestions on how to go about that? Can I have it welded? If I do have
it welded will it be strong enough? 

Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated

Thanks

	Roger that, Thanks.

producability or manufacturing tolerances ? BTW the Cypress 914 book
also very clearly stated there should be 3 shims with the last one being

Subject: Re: 944/928 bal/cam belts tensioning

To continue the discussion --
I have had the belt tensioning tool for about 6 years now, and use it once or
twice a year to check the cam belt tension on my 944S.  I believe it has two
fixed posts and  a 3rd movable post with a spring/dial guage hooked up to it
that registers higher on the dial guage the harder the belt pushes against
the 3rd, spring-loaded post. I think it is a very ingeniously designed way of
determining how much tension is on the belt by actually measuring the amount
of force it takes to displace the belt perpendicular to its run. It is
undoubtedly overpriced, but I *LOVE* the way my car feels at 6500 rpm knowing
that the belt is "dead nuts" perfectly tensioned.  But, I tend to be a
worry-wart type who hears strange noises at idle.  
If one were to tension the belt without the guage, my guess is you would
leave it too loose, not wanting to put too much strain on it.  A loose belt
will probably wear the idlers a little more, and maybe wear out faster --
that's my guess.  I used to loan mine out to others in the CVR, but everyone
who was borrowing it has their own now. HTH.

Who knows how the German mind works? (Probably Albrecht, and if we're
lucky, he won't tell us.... 8{) ) The 356 uses *ONE* shim -- which
means that if you need to diddle the endplay, you'd best have a bag of
shims and a micrometer handy. All VW-derived engines use 3 shims, with
the possible exception of the 25 HP units. I've never seen one apart,
so can't say for sure. 

My bet has to do with stability of the end play setting under thermal and
vibration loading. But that's just a guess.

Ouch. Yes, please do use new shims. Not a bad idea under the best of
situations.

There was a question recently about the 944 registery, 
and what ever happened to it.  I used to belong, but never got
a renewal notice.  Anyway, they bought a tool and "rented" it

I'm beginning to believe that my valves really are safe from intimate contact

me. Could someone explain how it works? Why it is so expensive? Why some
clever person hasn't figured out how to build a device that would work in
conjunction with, say, a torque wrench and a feeler gauge, do the same job,
and sell for less than $100? Since that belt is a concern of just about
everyone on the water-cooled side of this list, it might be possible to
sell enough of such a device to make it worth thinking about, anyway.

Subject: 914 fuel injection, ignition timing.


  Hello again.
  I have somehow dumped the last two days of incoming pfile postings, and it 
has been nearly two days since any messages have come in (non-digest mode). 
 Matthew is the only msg that survived,
so if there is someone out there waiting for a response, I apologize and ask 
a re-send.

  Meanwhile, I have a situation I need some verification on.
  In re-converting my '73 914 2.0 to oem fuel injection, I have hit on a 
snag with the drive gear timing of the distributor.  I am attempting to put 
things back to the way they are supposed to be.
  Among those is swapping the .009 distributor with the oem unit that has 
the F.I. trigger contacts.

  The factory manuals dont have an actual photo of a 2.0's ignition 
distributor showing the relative positioning of the spark rotor in relation 
to the hash mark and the crank timing mark for cyl. #1.
  There is a hash mark on the distributor body that should point roughly 
toward the timing access cover and if memory serves, that mark is the cyl. 
#1 spark wire location.  When things are properly lined up and timed, the 
rotor should also point at this hash mark and the timing access cover.  Am I 
OK so far?  Perhaps if someone could elucidate on the hardware timing ...

  My dillema is the distributor drive gear has been offset.  I have diddled 
with the drive in efforts to correct, but i cant seem to get the gross 
timing set.
 I know, keep trying.

  A second issue;
  Anyone know a good place to purchase a PERLUX points eliminator?  What is 
a good price?

   Thanks in advance.  -kyle

   Glad you admit that you will be "unable to help with Webers". But,

Peter, for your interest, edification and knowledge, I DID TELL Mr.
Lustgarten

how to diagnosis his problem- by private E-Mail! (Thank God for Private

E-mail! That way people can have a nice discussion without evesdroppers 

criticizing every word.). 



And incidentally, odds are that Art's problem lies NOT in the

Webers (or the Stars, dear Brutus), but somewhere else in the engine! 

(Or ourselves.) So I told him how to narrow it down to ONLY the carbs 

BEFORE proceeding to do something he might regret. (As my old Mercedes 

manual said: "No matter how poorly the  engine ran BEFORE the carburetor 

overhaul was attempted, it will most assuredly run WORSE afterwards.")

You ought to look before you leap off the deep end. 



You said:

> Again, if Mr. Lustgarten is getting his jet information out of a

  Mr Lustgarten is just trying to get his engine running. I'm trying to help

him do so. And first we gotta find out what the Problem really is!



 

> The 40 IDF Webers have 28 mm venturis, not the 27 mm you mentioned)

> In my original reply I said I THINK the Webers have 27 mm venturis;



 I'm glad you now have the correct information.



>... We are talking about the man's Weber 40 IDFs, the same carbs

> Pellow recommends for 356s, not 44s. 



   I recommend both the 40 and 44IDF- depending on the application.

The 40's are good for a street engine, they're more tractable around

town and give better gas mileage. The 44's produce more high-end power-

and give you the sound of the Ferrari at less than 1% of the cost!

The 40's, have a 40mm bore are best used with the Solex manifold and

the Adapto-plate. (This also minimizes interference with the sheet metal

and spring plate bolts on late-model fan shrouds.) The 44's, having a 44mm

bore, should be used with the Weber manifold as it too has a 44mm bore.

That way things match. The Weber manifold requires some trimming of the

Side Vertical shrouds to provide clearance. Also, if you use the Weber

manifold on late-model Fan Shrouds, you gotta watch out for interference

between bolts holding the Spring Plate on the Fan Shroud and the

screws holding the block-off plate on the Weber. (Put one on someday,

you'll see.)





>Pellow sends his Solexes to Eurometrix, just like everybody else.

 

  WRONG!  WRONG!! WRONG!!! I don't use Eurometrix! Never have. In fact,

we've re-rebuilt carbs that Eurometrix rebuilt as they weren't working

right!   



      Peter, in the future please refrain from asserting as fact

things that you HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF! Otherwise it'll be obvious to 

the most casual observer on this list that you're suffering from a 

Major Rectal-Cranial Inversion.





I said: Webers have ball bearings



You said:

> So? Just about all the carbs ever built have solid bearings and do

> just fine; tired 30-year-old Solexes after you rebush and rebuild them do

> fine too.



    The point is: Webers don't NEED the throttle shaft bore rebored,
rebushed

and rebuilt as with ball bearings they don't suffer from throttle shaft

wear like the Solexes do. THAT'S the point!



I said: With Solexes, changing a main jet means that the entire 

contents of the float bowl pours out all over your nice sheet metal



You said:



> OK, Einstein, if the contents pour out, how can you prevent this? TIME'S
UP!

> Use a syringe to empty the float bowl through the vent opening BEFORE

> you take out the main jet carrier.



Not all of us have syringes at our disposal. What do you do with the

syringe when you're not sucking out Solex sumps?



 BTW, I thought I answered before the buzzer sounded, but the way I'd 

drain the float bowl of a Solex without use of illegal drug paraphernalia, 

is to just turn the FUEL COCK to "OFF" and run the carbs out of gas! 



     My point was- Webers are designed to have easily changed jets, since

many cars with Webers went racing and fast jet changes tend to be helpful

when racing. Having the Main Jet, Air Correction Jet and Emulsion Tube

on a single, easily-removed Jet Stack is a MUCH better idea than having

to syringe out the gas before changing the Main, or having to remove the 

air cleaner/velocity stacks to change the Air Correction Jet. And I notice

that you didn't even attempt to explain how to remove the Solex Emulsion

Tube!



You said:

> It's easier to change jets on Webers because you HAVE to change jets on

> Webers. Otherwise the world would have no need for old Ferrari mechanics.



Nope, wrong again! 90% (OK, 80%) of the 40IDF's run just fine out of the

box with the stock jets! But ifin you have to change the jets on a Weber,

it's about 30 seconds a hole. (See above for details.) I doubt that

you're that good with a syringe unless you've had a lot of practice.



Perhaps we need to have a Jet Changing Contest on Mrs Olsen's driveway

just to see who's right!

 

And lastly: you said:



>  TELL THE MAN WHAT JETS TO PUT IN HIS WEBERS SO HE CAN DRIVE AGAIN !!! 



To which I reply:



I did better than that: I TOLD HIM HOW TO DIAGNOSIS THE PROBLEM! 

IT MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CARBURETORS!



Oh, and one more thing:

 

KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!

Subject: Screen wash fluid in a 911


	Every other car I have owned (including a 944) has had a
transparent screen-wash reservoir. Thus it was comparatively easy to top
it up - I could easily guesstimate how much water and how much neat screen
wash fluid to add to make up a 25% or 33% or whatever solution.

	The 911 (89MY Carrera 3.2), on the other hand, seems to have a
completely hidden reservoir, with only a small filler hole (beside the
petrol ("gas") filler) visible. How on earth do I know what the level is?
It's illegal to have an empty screen-washer bottle in the UK, and even
lowly Fords have a warning light (as well as a transparent reservoir!)

	Do I have to make up a 25%/33%/whatever% solution in advance and
then top up the reservoir on a weekly/monthly basis? Does anyone have a
better solution (pardon the pun!)?

When I was shopping for conversion stuff for my 911, I found various
vendors:

Try contacting Golden Coachworks, in Golden, Illinios at 217-696-2752.  
They make and sell many conversion kits, and I have dealt with them
for various things in the past.  They will work with you to find
out how your lights work, and can suggest or provide the fixes
you need, or where to get the parts.  I needed a rear deck lid from
a 911 Carerra for the grille on my RUF spoiler for the front of
my conversion, and they hooked me up.  They just happened to have
one laying around, they cut and sized it for me, and shipped it
to me, for practically nothing, like 20 bucks or so.  Do you know how
much a rear deck lid costs new????.  They do lots of slant nose stuff,
and have many other parts cheaper than many places.  Good guys they are.
They have a nice little catalog too, with lots of pictures and descriptions
of what they do, and how it is done.

Another place is A.I.R., American International Racing in Burbank, CA.
Try them at 818-845-8880.  They do, and sell all the parts for all types of
Porsche conversions, even a nice 911 -> 959.  RSR Spoilers, and yes, slant
noses.  They would have the headlight parts and info.

Then there is Better Bodies in San Ysidro, CA at 619-428-2775.  This place
went as far as sending about 20 actual photographs of cars they had done.
This was amazing.  They do slant nose, and some super wide body conversions.
This is where I bought my RUF Late Style spoiler.  They have some really
funky conversions, some a little tacky for my taste.  

All these places should be able to help you with a stuck headlight.
Good luck, try Golden first though, they helped me alot with instructions
and stuff on the phone.

Lastly, for anyone interested in conversions (slant nose, 911->930 body),
Alan Johnson racing has the BEST prices on flare kits.  Around $900 for
the entire kit, flares, rocker extensions, etc.  And this is what most of
the racing shops use for their kits.  They sell more kits than any other
place, so they say.  I bought a kit from them, but the shop that did my
911 Targa -> 930 Targa conversion would not use anything but a factory
Porsche kit, so I had to send the AJR kit back.  I went with the factory
conversion, and am now happy with it.  I have seen other conversions, some
good, some bad.  it depends on the shop/person that does it.  But many
flares conversions can be distinguished from a true 930, side by side.  I
took mine to Chambers Porsche in Boston, and the fellow there thought mine 
was an original Wide-Body Targa, as the one in this months Excellence.  He
lost it for a second when I told him it was a conversion.

73 911T sounds like a truck. Upon inspection missing stud #2 cylinder.
Ok. Probably dropped out. Removed heat exchanger. Broke both studs #1 in
doing so. #2 dropped out -- looks like a dime-sized hole where stud screws
into jug.

Question: What's wisdom on broken studs. Not enough stud extension to do much
with broken end. Looks like a drill out retap from an on the creeper yuk in
the face job. Suggestions? What about #2? Any thoughts on how far into the
metal studs can go? Could replace with longer stud? Total metal gone from
stud area about 3/8" hemisphere.

By the way, this is one of those "project cars" recent discussions have
addressed. My list to date includes repair rust both door posts, horn inop,

must have had giant mass in them for centurys (lard ass?), left door pocket
missing, right pocket warped and trim missing (price these suckers!), left

Subject: Perlux "Ignitor" points eliminator

Greeting all from a newcomer to the list!

Kyle Ehler asked where to purchase the Perlux (sp?) "Ignitor" points eliminator 
setup.  Best bet would be to leaf through an issue of "Hot VWs" at the newsstand
and look at the ads in the front and back.  I believe a standard price is btw 
$50-$60.  I got mine at a local shop for $75 (ooops!).

BTW, I have no idea about others' experiences, but I don't recommend getting it.
I experienced no increase in performance (which makes sense because it doesn't 
really do anything the points don't) but I did have trouble installing it, 
particularly with respect to the clearance between the lower radius of the rotor
and the top of the pick-up mechanism.  This eventually caused the unit to fail, 
but perhaps this can be attributed to a crummy installer (me).  I went back to 
points and as long as I replace them occasionally -- no problems.

Suggestions:
(1) Rethink choosing the Perlux to replace points.
(2) Make sure there is enough clearance btw the rotor and pickup. You may 
actually have to machine down the rotor
(3) Make sure that distributor is in good shape... no excessive free play on 
distributor shaft.

     I'm not sure where I got this, but if you mean the motor supposedly
   the popular part was off a Mazda RX-7. If you mean any other linkage or
   sheetmetal itself, your best bet is to find a fabricator.

     If identification of the old motor is impossible, you could take it
   to an Electrical shop and they could probably fix it for you. As cheap
   as Mazda parts are, if it is a Mazda part, buying a new one would be 
   the good bargain.

Subject: 914 Engine Rebuild Advice

Hello all,

My 1974 1.8litre 914 just decided that 170,000 miles on an engine without a 
rebuild is too long.  I think the clearances got to large and oil pressure 
dropped causing bearing failure.  Yuck!

I am new to the list, so I probably have missed several threads on this issue (I
will go through the archives soon) but I need advice on the rebuild.

Here is the plan:

 -Use 2.0 crank, counterweighted
 -Find 2.0 rods
 -Put in the NPR "big bore" kit (96mm?)
 -have "Rimco" or "Fat Performance" (SoCal shops) go through case and heads
 -mild port job on heads?
 -Increase CR by 0.5 over stock
 -Hydraulic Valves with mild (usable with FI) hydraulic cam grind
 -Add remote mount oil filter and cooler (replace current filter with larger)
 -run a second filter as a bypass (to get the really small stuff!)
 -run synthetic oil (after break-in, of course)

That's the general plan.  A good one?  In particular, will the Air Flow 
Controlled L-Jectronic FI setup be able to keep up with the mods?  Should I get 
a set of 2.0 litre injectors?  Why or why not?  (what is the difference anyway?)
I live in CA so FI is the preferred fuel metering device.

One final set of questions.  Tranny needs rebuilding.  Is this something I could
do myself?  Also, the clutch tube has broken loose, not an uncommon problem, and
I don't want to go cutting into the tunnel to weld it in place, onlt to have it 
break again.  Anyone know how to put in a hydraulic clutch?  Does the 911 pedal 
cluster have a hydraulic clutch and if so can I bolt it in and mod in a master 
cylinder.

Experience: I have rebuilt three VW engines and a Triumph tranny

All advice is greatly appreciated -- I want to get my baby back on the road!

Yup, as were the Jag wire wheels, and the much-lusted after Rudge
knock-offs for the racing Porsches of yesteryear... Again, that's
*DIFFERENT* - the factory shipped street cars that way, so you're
safe from a liability aspect.

Basic safety was never the issue -- just how your insurance company was
likely to react to that particular modification.

If you've got the right tools, they pop right off. For the Brit wire wheels,
that means you need a hammer. For modern centerlocks, you gotta have the
right impact gizmo. And you're 100% right about the original reason to
use centerlocks -- one nut off, one nut on, and you're out of the pits
with four new tires and a tank of gas in 18 seconds. However, we got into
this when I suggested that Scott think about using centerlocks to make 
available a wider selection of used competition wheels (knowing Scott,
I'd bet this is autox rather than say endurance racing....)

I partially disassembled the headlight last night and found that 
the retractable light assembly is a custom job and not a Mazda 
unit. I am not sure whether the motor itself is a Mazda motor or not
since it didn't have a Mazda label on it. There may be a label on the 
underbelly of the motor. I'll find out after I totally disassemble
the unit. It did have a "Made In Japan" label though so I know at least 
it was from the same country. :)

Beran,

Sorry, I don't know of any change to the induction system recommended
by Porsche.  As long as you don't go driving through really deep
water, you should not have a problem.

As far as PCA legality of changes, it depends on where you plan
to drive or compete.  For track events, you can do anything you
want provided you do not create a safety problem.  For PCA Club

Not *quite* in that catagory, but close... The carbs on 356s were *SO* much
better than those on many other period cars that you had to take a big
step up to see any improvement. This was not like the VW where you had 
one wimpy carb for four cylinders, you at least had two moderately
respectible carbs, one for each cylinder bank, from Day One.  And with 
factory Solexes readily available, why use Holleys where you'd also have 
to fabricate the new intakes?

I have been running a Perlux in a time trial application for about two years.  
Clearance is absolutely a problem.  I sent mine back to the mfg and they ground 
the outside of the unit down.  The clearance problem exists because the 
distributor cap, when installed, touches the Perlux unit and pushes it into 
rotor.  After grinding down the outside of the unit, no problems.

Please replace your points.  They are an anachronistic and unreliable way of 
signalling the ignition.  If you don't want to hassle grinding down the outside 
of the Perlux, use the Crane (ex Allison) which uses a photo circuit (as opposed
to the magnetic sensor of the Perlux).


Good luck,
Jon

Could be a number of things, but check the warm-up regulator first.  Sorry,

IMHO:
They're just like that. The design of the warm-up regulator etc. just doesn't
quite handle cold engine conditions as well as an electronic FI setup does.
Nothing you can do.

Subject: 914 fuel injection, ignition timing

Dear Kyle:

Congratulations on reinstalling the fuel injection. You will certainly
increase the value of your 914 over a thousand dollars and make it much more
acceptable to 914 nuts!

Of course it is important for the distributor drive gear to be properly
installed as well as the oiling washer at the bottom of the drive. The gear
is installed as follows:  Remove the number one sparkplug and put your finger
in the hole while turning the engine over by hand until you feel compression
at your finger and see the "0" or white mark (red mark only for 1.8 models)
appear at the notch under the timing hole plug. When all of this occurs, drop
the drive gear 12 degrees to the left of center with the smaller part of the
cut circle to the right passenger side of the car. You may have to reinstall
it several times to get it just right. When this gear is installed properly,
the distributor will line up perfectly with the number one cylinder notch in
place and the number one spark plug lead at the distributor cap in about the
10:30 position with wires clockwise connected 1,4,3,2. Installing the gear
and the distributor in this manner will insure positive results without being
"180 degrees out" or worrying about the firing order when starting a newly
installed engine.

Subject: 914 owners assoc.

Dear Kevin:

Thank you for your comments and concern. As 914 ownership is actually a great
hobby it is important that all owners be united through one organization.
Since it is so difficult to find anyone to volunteer their time to take the
helm, we are very happy when anyone exerts their time and effort. Dennis
Deeds for years, has taken it upon himself to keep some semblence of a club
together for all of us. He would love someone to help him - the association
could be much, much better. Call him and suggest - (619) 325-6583.

As far as your letter, it was answered quite a while ago, but I will respond
again.

You are correct. The factory 914-6 heat exchangers are too restrictive for
any "six" engine over 2.4 litre. Thankfully as wildly popular as are the six
conversions, many aftermarket heat exchangers and headers are available. B&B
fabrication (602) 842-1234 recently has produced a beautiful header/heat
exchanger available for different sized 914-6 engines - even with motronic
fuel injection! Hot heat and great performance are the result. Martin
Schneider Design Systems (818) 448-8726 has made a header set for years and
they are available in all different sizes. Electric heaters that install
behind the speaker grilles and in the heater tubes are available through Hot
VW's magazine and they allow the dash controls to function normally while
providing the hottest instant heat available. These are the alternatives to
the expensive factory units. 

The 915 gearbox installed in the 914-6 must use an electric speedometer. It
attaches via a pickup installed into the ringgear and pinion cover.(our 916
has a cable arrangement but it's a gizmo!) George Vellios (310) 542-0806 has
a pickup available to make the electric speedometer work perfectly!

I assume your 205/50x15 tires are mounted on the front and 225/50x15 on the
rear. This combinatin will keep the speedo accurate.

Finally, your 915 transmission is a 1977 model. (The third digit tells) As a
point of advice for all of you who want to install a 915 gearbox into your
six, buy at least a 1977. It has the electric pickup on the ring gear as well
as a bolt-in throwout bearing guide tube (the earlier variety would wear out,
slip forward, and spill transmission oil all over!)

Subject:  Re: rough starts

Even though I own a modern car, (i.e. one with Motronic), I am quite
familiar with CIS problems, due to having owned 4 mid-80s Audi cars.

Your problem (rough idle when cold) can be caused by a lot of things.

Vacuum leaks are always likely culprits. Don't forget the seals around the
injectors (I always forget those until I've spent several hours in the
diagnosis), and the intake boots.

The warmup regulator can be the problem. One of the Upfixin' der Porsche
books (available from the PCA national office) has a procedure for making
the warmup regulator adjustable.  To properly diagnose the warmup regulator,
you will need the fuel pressure gauge set to watch the system and control
pressures as the engine warms up.

When you check the warmup regulator, you sould also look for the system
pressure to be maintained by the check valve and the injectors after shutoff.

Cold  start valve is probably not the reason. With that failure, you will
not get started at all when it's cold.

Oh, yeah, don't forget to look at the injector spray pattern.  When it's
cold, that becomes a little bit more of a factor than when hot.

As Bruce Anderson said once (and I smiled when I heard it for the first
time), CIS Systems are like an onion, you just have to peel away one layer
at a time until you figure it out.

Hi Richard,

What I believe you're hearing is the oil flowing through the cooler lines to
the oil cooler.  I too noticed this on my '82 SC and surmised this to be
the case given that the noise was localized to the side of the car where the
oil lines run.  I thought the oil cooler lines on all factory equipped 911's
ran down the passenger side so this may not be the case...?
The only other idea I could come up with would be A/C tubing.

One of the niftiest centerlock arrangements I'm familiar with was on a
Lotus Elan I used to race.  It came with steel wheels which were knock on,
but were located by pegs in the hub which then stuck through the wheel,
instead of splines. 

When we replaced the steel wheels with alloys we didn't think to replace 
the pegs with longer ones.  As the original pegs, which now didn't stick all 
the way through the wheel now weren't providing the necessary location 
you can guess what happened.  Going down the hill into turn 3 at Seattle 
International Raceways I was passed by my own wheel!  

That was more than a few years ago, however.

Brother, i hear you. I've been trying to nail down noises in my hatch for 
a year.. no luck.. i've tightened the rear wiper, taken out the carpet to 
see if something below was causing it... I even resorted to putting putty 
on the surfaces i thought were rattling. No dice.  I fear this happens to 
many 944's after they loosen up a bit, but most people don't seem to get 
as crazed over rattles as i do :(
good luck.

Actually, what Peter or anyone else would more likely use is a rubber

OK, it's that season again...

Who's got a novel solution to the genuine Porsche Leaking Battery Box?  

I was able to patch mine last year with some underbody coat spray, but
this year I have puddles again on my passenger compartment floor.  (The
fiberglass I put in three years ago didn't hold up, either)

Hmmm?

Hi, Mike
 
>Maybe Peter is diabetic?
 
Thanks. Good explanation. But no, I'm not, and syringes are easy to get,
legally. You just can't get needles for them. Better hardware stores and
machinist supply stores carry them. Pharmacies carry these things too, with
a long integral hook-shaped plastic tip. They may also have larger models.
Also, a turkey baster (how appropriate!) from the grocery store will work,
but the gas will tend to soften the plastic.
 
Also, somebody whom I won't give the satisfaction of a reply suggests that
emulsion tubes are difficult to get out of an installed Solex. It's
actually pretty easy. Take one tapered jaw of a round-nose pliers and gently
push it in so that it slightly jams into the inside of the emulsion tube.
Take out pliers with emulsion tube hanging from end.

in the rear.  You could easily place a 6.5" sub in a free-air arrangement back

Oh, Kevin or I either can handle this..... It basicly is a very well
designed system that has one teeny tiny little problem: you *MUST* have
a common plenum or it doesn't work right. You CAN NOT get it to work
right if you're using high-butterfly or slide-valve throttle bodies.

BTW, to put on a good aftermarket EFI winds up costing between $8k
and $10.5k, depending. You have $2k of electronics, then another
kilobuck of injectors (you want blueprinted, and probably need special
flow rates, or may want a dual injector setup...), and a kilobuck of
fuel plumbing hardware (billet fuel rails, injector mounts, etc)
then probably $3-5K worth of throttle bodies, depending on if you 
want them that's cheap or them that works... Then a pile of dyno hours
and someone like me doing the setup...

Not that I'm trying to scare you off, just want you to be aware of what
it looks like! It would probably be cheaper to adapt a DME setup, but
then you'd *STILL* have the custom chip problem to deal with...

BTW, for 914s, it's not *QUITE* as grim, but it's still bad. The cheapest
raw parts setup you can get is about $2.5k using Berg throttle bodies.
There's still a ton of missing parts, fabrication, and setup to do...

There's a ton of stuff in the '91 and newer archives. One of these days,
I need to pull all that out in a single 914-engine-FAQ... Or book. Or 
something...

> Here is the plan:
> 
> -Use 2.0 crank, counterweighted

Counterweighting *ONLY* buys you anything in racing engines where you 
routinely exceed 7000 RPM. For "civilian" use, it adds problems, due to
potential loss of hardening from welding on the counterweights. You *CAN*
buy billet counterweighted cranks, but they're close to a kilobuck. Plus,
you'll never even *SEE* 7000 RPM unless you do a lot more...

> -Find 2.0 rods

Let me get this straight -- counterweighted crank, but STOCK rods? If you
*MUST* do the counterweighted crank, then at least to the rest right --
you need Carillo rods which are over 200 grams lighter EACH and a ton
stronger than stock. You can get them in stock 2.0 sizes, about $900 a
set of four.

> -Put in the NPR "big bore" kit (96mm?)

Best bet is really the Euro 2.0 pistons. Or equivalent from Arias or
Venolia, if you're still running after that high-rev goal. Be sure and
use lightened tool steel wrist pins in that case too....

> -have "Rimco" or "Fat Performance" (SoCal shops) go through case and heads

RIMCO, nope. FAT, yup. H.G. Bieker, yup. "Go through" means check EVERYTHING
and "deck" the case. For the heads, have any cracks around the plugs
fixed (send to Bieker ONLY if you need that), new valve guides, new valves,
FAT high pressure *SINGLE* springs. Titanium retainers optional 8{)
You need to be prepared to microclean everything when it comes back. No
one out there does a great job of cleaning up when they're done. One of
these days I'm gonna make a case-sized ultrasonic cleaner...

Oh -- for racing applications, adding piston oil squirters is a worthwhile
mod. While you're in there.

> -mild port job on heads?

Not needed if 2.0. IF 1.8, not needed for street use. For full racing,
well that's another story. Full race is NOT street, and you wouldn't
want to use them and you DAMN sure wouldn't want to pay for it ($1500 each).

Double-ditto on "big valves" -- no good for street. Period.

> -Increase CR by 0.5 over stock

I'd build the engine with a zero deck height and set combustion chamber
volume for a nice 9:1 or 9.5:1. Those numbers can be easily calculated, 
don't have them handy. Get all the combustion chambers cc'd to make sure
they're the same. Note that I'm talking 1.5-2 points over stock...

> -Hydraulic Valves with mild (usable with FI) hydraulic cam grind

Don't do it. Get a FAT FC440 mild performance cam for fuel injection, 
new lifters, new cam gear, special "short" FAT bolts for attaching same.
Stay with mechanical. Read the last couple of months archives for my
commends on the lunacy of hydraulic lifters...

> -Add remote mount oil filter and cooler (replace current filter with larger)

Absolutely. Use Melling high volume pump, and Canton/MECA filter.
AND BE SURE to use the right oil  hose -- the black "oil line" crap you
get at Pep Boys doesn't hack it!!! You need 300 degree, 200 PSI hose.
You'll make over 85 PSI routinely with that Melling pump. Aeroquip makes
a nice blue-nylon braided hose that works with barbed fittings. You
can also get the AN fittings for barbed hose (HIGHLY recommended) 
to let you make up the hose *ONCE* and make-break connections with the
AN connectors. Pegasus is the *ONLY* place that has 1/2" barbed hose to
AN-12 90 degree fittings, BTW..

> -run a second filter as a bypass (to get the really small stuff!)

C/M filter goes to 6 microns at enough flow rate for NASCAR. I don't think 
you can do better than that.

> -run synthetic oil (after break-in, of course)

Optional. The Flat Fours (*ALL* of them) do much better on straight
weight oils. I use Valvoline SAE-40 Racing, going up to SAE-50 in summer,
and SAE-60 for races in the high summer. Red Line makes an nice single
grade synthetic as does Amsoil. I *hear* from my Valvoline rep that 
they do to, but have yet to have any show up at the shop...

> That's the general plan.  A good one?  In particular, will the Air Flow 
> Controlled L-Jectronic FI setup be able to keep up with the mods?  

Yes, but there may be a problem maintaining reasonable idle at low RPM
due to "lumpy air" through the flapper box.

> Should I get 
> a set of 2.0 litre injectors?  Why or why not?  (what is the difference anyway?)

Absolutely. If you're now at 2.0 displacement, or bigger, it's very
important to have 2.0 sized injectors. For competition motors where
you run over 6000 RPM, it's important to go to even BIGGER injectors
which either means getting Kinsler or Marren to make "stock" injectors
flow the right rates, or finding a Bosch alternative (there is one
good one, I'd be happy to sell you some but I'm not talking about what
it is......)

> I live in CA so FI is the preferred fuel metering device.

Doesn't matter if you live in Outer Snowshoe, Ontario, and the EPA 
never existed; FI is *THE* preferred way to go.

Sure, with about a kilobuck of special tools and the factory shop manuals.

Nope. To do that fix right, you MUST cut and weld. If that's done right,
you'll never have to do it again. It lasted *HOW LONG* before it needed
to be done this time?

Hydraulic setups are not advised. If you *MUST* do that, there is a
ton of fabricating that needs to be done.

> Experience: I have rebuilt three VW engines and a Triumph tranny

Well, that's a start. At least you SHOULD understand air cooled...

Because then you'd have to find the rest of the 2.0 EFI setup, including

Oh yeah -- I forget to get on my Accusump soapbox. For competition cars,
it's a must. For street cars, it's optional. If you get the right C/M
oil filter setup, you can later add a new top plate with a 1/2" NPT fitting
and plumb the Accusump to it, making it very easy to add later on.

Dear Doug, 
A while back you answered a post about 10" x 17" wheels for a 951. You said
you were running HRE's and 275/40 BFG's on the back. Since I'm planning to
use the exact same setup I need to know how you made out.
Specifically:
1. How do you feel about the quality of the wheels ? The price?
2. Did you get very minor rubbing or did you have to make more extensive
mods.?
3. Do you feel the expense was worth the result?
4. And, oh yes, did you realize a gain?
5. Was your car lowered and do you think that exacerbated the rubbing?
Thanks for your help. I'm trying to look a bit before I leap.
BTW The only suspension mods I have made to my 951 S is a turbo cup front
swaybar and Weltmeister rear sway bar.

Subject: re: Car Cover Recommendation Needed

Dietrich,

I just purchased an Ultralon Supreme cover made by Covercraft.  Covercraft 
seems to be the preferred company among the various folks that I have spoken 
with.  I am pretty happy with my cover.  It is largely water resistent but the 
car still gets wet during down pours.  The key part is that the cover breathes 
well so the moisture does not get locked in -- I have checked after a few 
storms.  I paid approximately $150 for my cover and encourage you to shop 
around.  Aside from this ultralon material, the "supreme" part of the name 
denotes that the cover has sealed seems which is suppose to keep the rain 
out--I am not sure that it is worth it right now.  

WRT to fit, I think the big difference is where the mirror pockets are located 
on the cover and it will depend largely on modifications that you have done to 
the car.  A friend brought a cover by Covercraft, I believe, made out of 
Evolution 4 material for his 911.  He seems happy with it but finds it a 
little bulky (my cover is not exactly super compact either).

Cheers,
Bill	88 951

Subject: RE: User-programmable engine computers

[snip]

I started looking into these systems this past summer and started collecting 
information about who is making them. The file is at home, but I will try to 
summarize what I came across. I looked into the Haltech/Emtech, 
Electromotive TEC series, J&S system, EFI, DFI, the Simple Digital System 
and maybe a few others. One trait that rises to the surface is almost all 
the systems were designed for 4/6/8/12 cylinder vehicles. When you mention a 
5cyl, you get a big huh? The only one who supported it out of the box  was J 
& S, they included a DIP switch setting for the 5 cyl. The SDS system out of 
Canada was the cheapest, around $700 for a 4 cyl setup. They said that they 
could make a custom 5 cyl version and their software would have to be 
recompiled to deal with it. The usual prices were in the $2000-$3000 range. 
I believe not one system had an integrated knock sensor built into the 
computer.

As for uses, a few years ago a friend installed a Haltech system onto a 
Porsche 914. It was a pretty clean installation on that car, as he was 
transitioning from carbs. The car was dialed in using a laptop running the 
Haltech software and the Haltech Air/Fuel LED meter. I got to play with the 
software, it wasn't anything outstanding, you changed the fuel and timing 
curves by adjusting points on a curve which is displayed on a graph on the 
screen. Nothing too fancy, but it got the job done. It took a while to get 
the system dialed in, but at that point, the car ran great. He dialed in the 
car without a dyno, spending much time driving the car around and tweeking 
the settings.

I know another mechanic who has used the Electromotive TEC-II or TEC-III (I 
can't remember which) on I think a V6 Maseratti. He mentioned something 
about trying to use it, but it wouldn't work because the V6 had some 
different firing sequence? I've got brain fade real bad on this 
conversation, sorry. I also have seen a Solo II CSP Mazda Miata setup with 
the Electromotive system. It ran great, but the owner said it took a while 
to get there. My TQC runs in CSP and he trounced me good.

Right now John Bekius, owner of Sportwheels in Glenwood Springs, CO and TQC 
mechanic,  is using the Emtech setup on Scott Davis's 85 TQC with a 20V 
turbo engine installed in it. The first version of this setup was running 
the 85 TQC CIS K-jetronic system with the 20V engine. Last year they 
installed the Emtech system which controls timing and fuel. At Brainerd, 
they were finally getting the system mapped out, and the car ran great. They 
program this system with a laptop, and every now and then you would see them 
take the car out  and change some settings. I think this system didn't have 
a knock sensor.

On thing I learned is that some of these systems don't even run closed loop 
with the O2 sensor. They run strictly on a lookup table basis. Also at the 
time, I don't think any of these systems had CARB certification, so none are 
street legal. With the EPA stuff only getting worse, this would affect the 
legality of the car. I wonder if any system with such programmability woudl 
be certified by CARB? As some of the places mentioned, most of these systems 
are designed for  race/drag cars and boats etc.

As to building a system from scratch, it would take some time, but there are 
some great parts out there. National Semi has some neat injector 
controler/driver chips and they also make the frequency to voltage 
converters for the crank sensors. There is also new knock sensing DSP 
technology which sounds interesting.  The parts seem to be out there and 
others have done it.

You could also go the HKS route and build a seperate box which interfaces 
with almost every input/output of the computer seperately and charge $600 
per box.:-). The Crane interceptor idea is also interesting although this is 
mostly being used on the Ford stuff.

Anyone else looked into these systems?

Porsche needs to correct its policy towards radio transmitters in their cars.
Reference: QST, September 1994, page 56. ("QST" is the "Panorama" of the
American Radio Relay League, ARRL).

Quote (from QST, quoting PCNA)
        Porsche "prohibits the installation of radio transceivers and any
    after-market electrical equipment in new Porsche vehicles." They
    "discourage the addition or use of non-Porsche supplied telephone
    equipment in the vehicle." If transmitters are operated within their
    cars, control or warning lamps may light up with no apparent reason,
    or malfunctions may occur in other electrical equipment.

In this day and age with technology at its present state there is no excuse
for an automobile manufacturer to have such a policy. Such a policy questions
the quality of a manufacturer's product and engineering.

The policies of Chrysler, Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo, were
excellent IMHO. Particularly Chrylser who had a booth at the 1994 Dayton
HamVention handing out literature and answering customer questions.

ok folks, heres the status.
I'm now running Porsche "red" calipers (as used on the 3.6 turbo and RSR)
and floating Coleman slotted rotors from VCI. These puppies are BIG. The
rotors ride on Aluminum hats that fit over the (modified) stock hub,
changing the wheel offset, requing custom built wheels, so I got HREs
(they're cheaper and not much heavier than BBs and DOT legal), 8.5 and
10x17 with 255 and 275/40 street TAs. The work was done by Mike at
Powertech here in joisey.  He claimed he could fit the wheels, although the
fronts were the largest he'd ever attempted. I figured it was worth it to
avoid the hassles of guessing about wheel offstes. My first run at the glen
(I run in the advanced group at the BMWCCA events) produced so much smoke,
the guy behind me thought I'd blown a turbo. I spent the weekend putting
washers on the REAR (!) wheel studs to space them away from the inside
front of the wheel well. I finally had the wheel hitting both the inside
AND outside if the wheel well.

The car is an 86, so the fender lip isn't rolled, but that wouldn't make
enough room anyway. the suspension is the stock factory sport setup, except
for Andial sway bars, 30 mm front, 24 (I think) rear. Note also that the
later cars have a slighlty larger rear torsion bar. Yesterday I had the car
back at powertech, and Mike is going to make a new rear spacer based on my
"experience". He's also going to price a new suspension set-up. the options
range from new rear shocks with helper springs to the whole porsche
motorsport suspension. Any suggestions? I figure to get a track suspension,
although I drive to the track (no Trailer for me) and the thought of 5
hours with 600 lb springs is a little scary.

(there was also an S at the glen running 11.5 and 9.5x17 with 275/40 and
235/45 tires. his rears rubbed too, but those wheels were TOO wide for the
tires. He'd apparently gotten the absolutely widest wheels for the tires,
as opposed to the correct ones.)

my car was good to begin with, and with all the tire hassles I didn't
really drive hard (I usually don't). Certainly, I didn't ratchet the level
up the first time out. The car always just seems to go where I point it. I
often try a little extra turn input on the exits, and there's always stick
to spare. I feel more secure. (good) My brake problems are gone (also
good), and one of my instructors figured I could have come to a complete
stop anywhere on the track. warping the stock rotors was why I started
this. The pad temperatures stayed below 450-460 F. The old cool brake
backing plate doesn't really cover the air inlet on the new rotor though. 

The wheels look great, although there's a flat spot (no damage, or evidence
of contact) on the outside of one front rim. Mike says the forged rims are
VERY strong and is going to check with gene at HRE, but I'm not hopeful
about a replacement. Maybe they weren't heat treated correctly. it doesn't
affect the roundness, so I imagine I'll just have to live with it.

On the street, the tires don't rub. I'm guessing that with my optimized
spacer, I was only rubbing coming out of two or three turns at the glen. I
figure to keep the car long term. (This conversion was NOT cheap, nor
apparently finished) As I suspected, once you start traveling up the spiral
its hard to stop. As I keep pointing out to my wife, its cheaper than a
mistress.
lets see, big exhaust, extrude hone the intake, modfied turbo...
More details as they become available (MDASTBA?)

You are right Pete,
I currently have a 74 914 with 2.0L engine and 1.8 injection system.  I did not 
do the mod (purchased the car that way) but the car runs great.  George Hussey 
of AA says "The 2.0 engine you have will certainly run smoother with the 1.8 
injection system, but will not be as peppy as with the 2.0 injection system. The 
true value in switching to the 2.0 system besides increased power is for value. 
a true 2.0 injected engine makes your 914 worth ?1500 more than a like 1.8!"

Now if I have a "true 2.0", you can bet I'll try to locate the 2.0 injection 
system for the extra pep & and increased value (that assumes that I have enough 
pocket change to do so).  But keep in mind that I have not done any other mods 
to the engine, it is essentialy stock.

	My 911 (3.2 Carrera, '89MY) occasionally cuts out on me. This
happens when the car is cold (e.g. driving home from work after standing
all day) and I stop (say for a roundabout or traffic lights). It's not
normally the first or second time I stop since starting the car, so the
engine will have warmed up a bit.

	Any thoughts as to the culprit? The car is still under warranty,
but I'd rather have some idea what's wrong before bringing it near the
dealers!

	Also, is the warm-up routine documented anywhere? The car seems to
"hunt" a bit when first started, but I'm told this is normal. I'd like to
know what revs it should go to and for how long to check that its working
OK.

my personal preference is to drive as soon as it starts but, I avoid hi
revs until the car is warm.  How do I know the car is warm?  I drive by
the oil gauge.  I keep the pressure below 120 psi when the car is
cold.  When the pressure stays below that due to warmer oil, then I

Subject: '81 sc  warmup behavior

Hi Gang,

I am about to buy an '81 sc.  I have had a 77 911S for about 11 years
and I find the warmup behavior of the SC engine very different and
would like some info as to whether it is normal or bodes of a problem
to come.

The cars starts well.  The cold idle goes to about 1800 rpm and stays
there for about 10 minutes.  After that it slowly drops to about 1000
rpm.  The only difference between this behavior and what I am used to
is the length of time it takes the engine to idle down to 1000 rpm.  In
my '77 this took about 3 minutes.

Anybody have a comment??

 -Steve

I went through a couple of Technalon fabric covers for my 911, then got a
silver (aluminized?) official Porsche cover from the local dealer.

I've been very happy with the Porsche cover.  It's light and easy to put on,
but very water repellant.

I think it cost just over $100 with the 15% discount which the dealer (Rusnak)

Subject: Re: 914 Engine Rebuild Advice

Dear John

I'm happy to see you have driven your 914 170,000 miles and hope you drive it
170,000 more! Although we are stock perfectionists, we have built hundreds of
914 engines and recommend the following:

1. Since 914's are becoming rarer and more valuable by day and restorers are
investing thousands in them, it is best to do as the factory would have done
but take extra time. With that considered, we recommend the following:
   A. It costs almost as much to rebuild a 1.7, 1.8 as it does a 2.0 engine,
and a 914 with an injected 2.0 engine is much more powerful than a 1.7, 1.8
as well as $1500 more valuable. One would have to spend many extra dollars to
make a 1.7, 1.8 as powerful as a stock 2.0 engine. Hence, starting with an
injected 2.0 engine puts one miles ahead. These engines are cheaper than you
may think as we have seen them sell at swap meets and the Porsche Panorama
magazine for as little as $400.00. Local junkyards who don't know what they
have usually "give away" these engines. Unfortunately used 1.7, 1.8 engines
are virtually worthless so don't anticipate being able to sell or trade
yours.
   B. When rebuilding the 2.0 engine, we are careful to follow the factory
manual to the letter. It is self explanatory so we need not cover general
rebuilding. However we will cover the specific things the factory does not.
     1. The engine case:  Has a tendency to warp especially in the middle.
Have a competent shop check it and possibly align bore it. This will require
special bearings.
       a. 75-76 cases are especially prone to warpage beyond saving -
especially in the cam shaft bore. These engine cases, if not carefully
checked, cause a very hot running rebuilt engine!
       b. We take the time to eliminate all casting slag from inside the case
and make it as smooth as a baby's butt. We do not know how well this works,
but it has to reduce oil turbulence somewhat and let the crankshaft spin
easier!
       c. Oil Galley plugs:  By now many are loose. We repair/replace them
with a plumbing tap for a permanent repair. Why rebuild your engine, increase
the oil pressure only to blowout old galley plugs and all of the new oil!
    2. The crankshaft. Always inspect for cracks and polish and/or cut, but
not beyond .25mm! 2.0 crank counter balancing is difficult to do for
clearance reasons and is unnecessary below racing RPMs! We do, however,
carefully balance the front fan, crank, pistons, rods, flywheel and pressure
plate, all as one working unit.
    3. The connecting rods:  check for straightness and rebush.
    4. Camshaft: Always the factory one with a matched timing gear. This is
also the only one that works the best with the fuel injection.
    5. Lifters:  Always the solid factory type as hydraulic ones, although
quieter, sacrifice top end power and turn a 914 sports car into an economy
car.
    6. Pistons and cylinders: Always Mahle or Kolbenschmidt with 8.0 to
compression. The NPR kit is no longer manufactured and the last 2.0 variety
were actually dished on the top!
    7. Cylinder heads:  Eight new values and guides, combustion chambers
carefully "cc'd" and cut only enough for cleanup (2.0 heads cut too far are
garbage-can varieties and new ones are outrageously priced!)
    8. Fuel injection:  new vacuum line kit, head temp sensor, trigger
points, throttle switch. All of the other components, if still operational,
we reuse. Additionally use a 0 280 100 037 pressure sensor and an inline 270
ohm resistor between the control unit harness and head temp sensor lead (this
combination provides more top end power while still passing an emmissions
check.
   B.  Hopefully, by carefully following the factory manual and observing
these points, you will drive another successful 170,000 miles in your 914!

2. 914 transmissions although easily rebuilt with fairly inexpensive parts,
are difficult to "set-up" without very expensive factory tools. Hence a
transmission rebuild is best left to a professional who, besides having the
factory tools and presses, is well used to looking at worn gears so he can
decide what to reuse or replace. There is nothing worse than failing to
replace a marginal component, reinstalling the transmission and have it not
work properly!

3.  The 914 clutch tube is a common failure. Dr. 914 has written the
procedure in the past and offers it to you now:  it can only be fixed by
cutting a "door" in the center tunnel. (the factory should have reinforced it
knowing there would be more strain caused by the gismo roller assembly!
Hydraulic clutches on a 914 are impossible (Not for plenty of money and
fabrication they're not!!)

John, good luck with your 914 and keep the faith!

George Hussey


Clutch Tube Repair Procedure (a diagram accompanies this but we can't put it
on the computer!)

The 914 cable is conducted upon a certain route through the body via a
conduit or tube. The tube is bracketed in three places and spot welded so it
will not move.

Because of the rigged nature of the clutch cable repair roller assembly,
excessive strain is put on the cable and tube when the assembly gets dirty or
the clutch cable sheath melts. This strains the brackets and the tube finally
pulls loose.

This condition becomes evident when:  1. You have to constantly adjust your
cable, 2. Stack washers under the adjusting nut, 3. Experience a standstill
grind into first or reverse gear, but the clutch releases o.k. when the
throwout bearing arm is fully depressed at the bell housing, 4. Find the
clutch pedal to push extemely hard, 5. Have a problem shifting into fourth
and fifth gear, 6. Hear a "pop" and the pedal goes to the floor but the
clutch cable doesn't break, 7. "Clanging" in center tunnel when clutch pedal
is depressed and released, 8. Ripping of sheet metal at the firewall.

The remedy is simple. Reposition the tube and reweld it. The actual repair is
more difficult because the center tunnel must be cut open to access the tube.
The repair procedure is as follows:

We first start by removing the clutch and accelerator cables, shift lever
assembly, center cushion, floor carpeting and driver's seat. At the left side
of the shifter hole, in the tunnel, you can see the accelerator tube stacked
on the larger clutch tube. You may at this time notice a shiny spot on the
tube near the bottom of the shifter where it has been hitting. Grab the
clutch tube and shake it to see if it is loose. Using a flashlight, put your
cheek on the center tunnel and look forward to the U bracket holding the two
tubes. Measure forward to this point and cut a 3"x4" door above the bracket
and bend up. In an extreme case you will notice the tube has actually slipped
forward and you will see, by lack of paint, where the bracket used to cover
the tube. Grab the tube and push it back and into place. In an extreme case
you may wish to fabricate and replace the front bracket. Use a wire feed
welder to securely weld the tube to the bracket and the bracket to the body
and prime and paint before closing the door and welding the cuts. Exercise
extreme caution when welding because of the close proximity of the plastic
fuel lines. You may want to fill the right side of the tunnel with wet rags
prior to welding. We now move to the back firewall area.

If the tube was completely loose you may have noticed just a hole at the
firewall, but now since repositioned and rewelded in the front you will
notice a piece of the tube protruding from the firewall. This is the way it
is supposed to look! If the firewall has actually imploded, remove the access
plate inside the car under the center cushion and with a long screwdriver
push out the firewall. Reweld the tears and the tube solidly. Note:  The
factory originally brazed this area, so rewelding may be frustrating. Please
prime and paint this area thoroughly!

Finally in an extreme case the center bracket is also broken loose. Cut an
additonal door here just behind the center brace. (Refer to the diagram) Cut
to the very beginning of the wiring harness trough and then back 7" lifting
this newly cut door to the left. Usually the center bracket/brace - is well
ruined so you will have to make a U-bracket with sheet metal. Bend the newly
made bracket around the tube and weld this formed bracket to both the tube
and the floor. Prime and paint thouroughly. This is also an ideal time to
clean and treat this center tunnel area to further prevent rust. Reweld and
touch-up the cut door and reinstall all parts, cleaning the clutch roller
assembly and lightly greasing the cable. Pay particular attention to the
front clevis bushing to make sure the hole in it is not egg-shaped and the
clevis pin is not worn!

Upon completion and with proper maintenance you will never again experience
the clutch tube problem.

Subject: Re: RE: 914 injection systems

Dear Craig

Glad you are enjoying your 914. You truly have a 2.0 engine in your car, but
with 1.8 fuel injection system! I truly don't know if maybe this combination
is actually the best of both worlds for overall performance as AFC injection
is years ahead of MPC injection, and the 912E 2.0 engine used AFC to gain
more power! 2.0 engines can easily be verified by checking, first the i.d.
number (starts with GA,GB,or GC and is located in front of the oil filler and
behind the impellor housing) and then the cylinder heads (the intake runner
bolts to the head on three studs, the 1.7, 1.8 bolt on with four).

Your particular 914 needs little restoration, only freshening - exterior
paint and interior work. It has great potential and I hope you get years of
enjoyment from your car!

How much would you pay for an:

Black on Tan
70K miles 
Strong engine, have not checked compression but believe it is good.
Good condition, very clean inside out.
everything works, first gear grinds a little sometimes. Needs new clutch in 
about 5000 miles.
accident damaged but well repaired
most of the car panels have been repainted for one reason or another

My opinion is it's worth about $23K-$25K. Am I about right?

Align boring  a 914 is a SERIOUS mistake. Having had to tend to the care
and feeding of some very expensive specially modified E-Prod cases that
had been align bored, I can assure you that you never, ever want to try
to find bearings for that, particulary with a standard crank. And double
particularly on short notice.

Also, be alert for case fretting on the main bearing webs -- if you see
that, toss the case. You can't save it without extreme measures. Since
you ONLY need to worry about case serial numbers if you're doing some
sort of concours thing or if you're making a "real" 2.0 and need a GA or GC
case, it's not worth losing sleep over. I routinely find good used
GA cases for about $150-200 on the left coast, and W cases for just about
free. They're all the same, dimensionally, so you can use any for your
engine. Like I said, numbers matter for "real" 2.0s....

You can get the case inside coated with PolyDyne "Oil Shed" for about 
$100, and it works much better... Smoothing up the inside of a case
is an OK thing to do if you don't have anything else to do, or can run
an air line to the living room so you can run the die grinder while
watching TV or something... 8{)

AMEN!!! Particularly for competition engines!!

Send *ALL* cranks out to be tested for straightness, cracks and journal 
diameters.  Most of the 914 cranks I've seen out of never-rebuilt engines 
are bent but can be straightened by a good shop. Many need to be turned. 
0.25mm (0.010" or "one under") is OK for the rod journals, but no more. 
You *CAN* go to 0.75mm on the mains because the case design gives very 
good support. If you have A/C, expect the 4th main and nosepiece of the 
crank to be hosed up, and DO NOT use an undersize crank...

For race engines, I only use STD/STD cranks. I *HIGHLY*  recommend PolyDyne
DL coating the bearings.

As noted, balancing is critical. Contrary to note, counterbalancing is
*NOT* hard but as previously noted is completely unnecessary for non-race
engines. You can also make 2.0 cranks (which are expensive) from 1.7/1.8
cranks (which are cheap) by offset grinding and re-hardening. IF you need
to do this, shoot me a note-- I have a crank guy down here that's 
unparalleled. Ditto on counterweighting.

>     3. The connecting rods:  check for straightness and rebush.

Yup. And you may need to re-size the big end. This is OK for street
engines, but is a BIG no-no for racing. Good used rods are plentiful,
so don't feel bad about tossing your bad rods.  As noted, the hot setup
is the Carillo rods, but at a kilobuck for a set, that's best reserved
for racing.

>     4. Camshaft: Always the factory one with a matched timing gear. This is
> also the only one that works the best with the fuel injection.

Again, your milage may vary. We used to use a SCAT cam until having 
a couple grenade and SCAT decided not to stand behind their product
(one lousy $149.57 my cost crank has cost them over $15,000 in business
and if it were possible for same to put them under, I'd do it in a heartbeat.
So ask me how I really feel about those low-life transmission licking scum...)
FAT has a couple of nice grinds in addition to stock. One is race-only,
one is OK for street with EFI as long as you don't need to idle with
the A/C running (BTW, in case I haven't said this enough, A/C is EVIL
on any Type IV...) And there are a few custom grind I've been working on
for EFI street use that aren't available yet.

Note that the timing gear is riveted on by the factory. If you get a
new cam and timing gear, they're not attached. While you *CAN* rivet
them, it's common to use bolts to attach the two. When you do this,
BE CAREFUL!!! The DIN-spec 10mm bolts that you'd normally use have heads
that are TOO TALL -- they abrade the rear of the oil pump, sending a ton
of loose metal into the oil stream, just what you want.... You can either
machine normal Grade 8 bolts to have heads half as tall, you can bolt it
together then grind the heads down, or you can get the "short" bolt kit
from FAT. Guess which is easier to do...

Pay careful attention to this!!! And add new injectors to your shopping list,
along with a pile of Wurth 7mm  and 9mm fuel injection hose. And all of
the rubber parts. All!

There's more in the "some retweaking" than meets the eye, but you *ARE*
essentially right. However, if you had a *real* 2.0, with the G-series
case and three stud heads, it would hurt the value of the car to not
have the D-jet injection. Not to mention bumping you out of stock classes
for *ANY* driving event, SCCA or PCA.

Peter,

I do not believe that the average person with average tools can do a
decent job of aligning and corner balancing a Porsche at home. To do
it right, you need the correct tools and some experience.

I know Ray personally. He is an honest guy and if he says you can do it
at home, there has to be truth to it. I just don't see how to do it right.

Steve,

	My '83 SC idles at about 1400 for a couple minutes, then drops to
about 1000.  Once, a year or two ago, it idled at close to 2000 for
a short time.  It startled me, I cut the ignition and restarted, and 
it was back to normal.  It sounds like your prospective purchase isn't
quite right on cold start.  Just one opinion, for what it's worth (free).

Subject: Dilavar studs best?

Pfilers, what's your view on the best cylinder head studs?

I'm currently rebuilding a 73 911RS 2.7 (none of the original studs had 
pulled!), and I was originally going with 24 Dilavar studs.  However, a recent 
report in Excellence has me concerned.  Bruce Anderson, I believe, wrote 
recently that the Dilavar studs do not have an extremely high tensile strength, 
and occasionally break upon initial torque.  I assume this means they can also 
break sometime after initial torquing, which is even worse.

The recommended solution was the Raceware studs (coincidentally, advertisers in 
Excellence). Tthey supposedly have very high tensile strength, thermal expansion 
that matches the engine, and a "space-age" coating to prevent corrosion.  The 
space-age part has me a bit skeptical.

What's your experience/recommendation?

disaster struck me & my 944 today.

i was 450 miles into my 500 mile trip to NY.
80mph on I-90.  Needed to stop quick.  Pressed down -- the pedal sunk to 
the floor!! franticly, i got off of it, pumped it & the pressure came 
back.  from there on in, i'd have to pump the brakes to stop.

so, i'm 500 miles from home, at a friends house, armed only with a

do to make the brake situation better? it's the weekend, and the local  
porsche dealer is closed... I have a feeling the master cylinder is shot 
but i hope i'm wrong.. i've never looked @ the brakes on the 944.  ANY 
help would be appreciated. i can't afford to die this weekend! :(

Subject: Re: Aftermarket F.I. for 911 engines

I agree with what Stan wrote.  His prices look right, although it
is also true that, depending on your taste and budget, you can
follow somewhat cheaper routes with some of the additional plumbing
and hardware.

Electromotive apparently now has a TEC-II (or whatever) system
which will work without a stable manifold pressure signal, ie,
with just a throttle position plus RPM signal.  The old system
definitely did not -- I have the CO blood poisoning to prove it!

There are a few things to be aware of, if you are thinking about
a project like this.  One is the quality of tech support which
the vender will/can provide.  You *are* going to need it, unless
you are much smarter than me.  Electromotive totally flunked this
one, totally useless.  At one point, and for no obvious reason,
they suggested we set up the car by putting the nose against a
tree, then running up the rev's.

We have worked more recently with Haltech and with Dave Dahlgren,
whose name I have almost certainly have misspelt.  He's been very
available and helpful.  I forget Dave's title, but he is a
distributor for Haltech and is based in Connecticut.

In their defense, Electromotive has apparently improved their
tech support recently.

The programmability of the system varies a bit, having worked with
three brands.  For example, Electromotive offers very fine and
multi-stage control of accel and decel enrichments.  They offer
fewer grid points than Haltech in setting up the volumetric
efficiency and ignition timing tables, but on the other hand the
axis locations are adjustable.

Another thing to keep in mind is that, in my experience, you are
very often shipped the wrong hardware for your application, esp.
when it comes to the harness.  This happened to me most recently
with an Accel system on a Buick Grand National.  The engine just
would not run no matter what.  It also happened on a 911 where
they managed to hook up the ignition all wrong.  911's make really
unhappy noises when you spark them 120 and 240 degrees off.

Hi guys and gals,

Just a reminder for everyone that is interested in 'the Grand finale' of the 
F1 races this season. Tomorrow it brakes loose, Damon Hill is one point 
below Michael Schumacher and I guess we will see a splendid race tomorrow. 
(I'm up at 04:30 GMT to see the race) 

Yesterday Shumacher smacked his Benetton in the tire wall at 200kph during 
practice, trying to get pole, Nigel old boy put in a tremendous lap and had 
pole from yesterdays practice. 

This might be the first time in years the F1 championships are decided in 
the last race, 10pt to winner and 6pt to second, I can hardly wait to see 
what tactics Damon or 'Schuma' will use.....

BE THERE!!

(One happy Eurosport viewer...)

(The race should be around 8-9 in the evening Californian time, 11-12 at 
night on the East Coast.)

Peter, etal,

I have done the home alignment thing using Ray's book.  The principles in the
pamphlet are sound, however the quality of the alignment becomes a factor of
how accurately your measurements can be taken.
My car doesn't pull or exhibit any other symptoms of alignment problems and
two PCA driver's ed events didn't uncover anything strange.  I have to agree
with Scott Winders on the corner balancing issue - don't even think of using
this booklet to corner balance your car.

If your patience holds out (home alignment takes awhile), it can be done.
 The booklet is probable worth the money just from the standpoint of gaining
the knowledge of *how* to align a 911 (knowing what all of those eccentric
bolts do).

YMMV,

They're called Oetiker clamps.  There is a tool which both removes
them and crimps new ones on.  Removal is destructive: you cut the
loop.  The tool is available from Snap On and other sources, and
looks like a funny sort of wire cutter.

The clamps are available from Porsche and from OE hardware sources
such as Wurth.  If you need just a few, your best bet is to buy
them from your dealer.  Alternatively, a small hose clamp will
work fine.

Subject: 914 Flooding... Help.

Hey all,


	I need some help here on my '74 2.0L. I just recently replaced the
fuel lines and injectors on my 914. In addition to retuning the engine
after replacing the fan and reseting the timing. My problem is this:

	The engine seems to be flooding. I don't know why, and it's not
entirely predictable. My symptoms are a pronounced bucking while at freeway
speeds, and stalling at stops. I can tell it's flooding because of the
smell of gas in the exhaust and that it won't start unless I pull the fuel
pump relay. Once it starts and burns off the gas, I can put the realy back
in and it starts right away. 

	Problem two. This is for stan and any other people who might have
lots of experience with 914 flywheel and clutch geometry changes. I put in
a new/rebuilt tranny and the clutch is riding very low on the pedal with
the cable tightened as much as it can go without riding the throwout
bearing. There is a new flywheel, a new clutch disk, and a new preasure
plate. The throwout fork pivot has the stock one washer spacing. I don't
know if this is a result of a bad geometry or something else. HELP! The
rebuilt I got is trash, it's whines more and the gears are even harder to
engage than my old one which I feel was pretty wasted too. At least the
tranny is under warrantee. 

	So, if any one can help me here, it'd be really appreciated. And
the sooner the better.

Thanks,

The ignition miss that was occurring with my '72T was from the spark
plugs, I replaced the platinum plugs that were installed in May, only
about 3000 miles ago, and the car runs like it should.  Instead of the
expensive platinum plugs, I used Silver Bosch plugs, since they were the
only ones the local stores had.  I wonder how long they will last.  Since
the platinum plugs were installed about a month before I bought the car, I
am not sure if they were new or used, but 3000 miles seems like a very
short spark plug life.

Hello fellow P-philes,
I've tried to post this message twice before, but there is no indication
from my end that it got through.  If it did, and there were no responses,
then I'm sorry to have posted this problem again.
The problem I am having with my '86 928S digital clock is one that I seem
to recall seeing discussed by members of this group several months ago.
However, since I then had a 931 with an analog clock, I did not take much
notice of the discussion.  The problem is that the LCD of the clock
sometimes goes blank.  Othertimes, the clock loses time.  This seems to
be a random event, not associated with ignition on/off, etc.  In addition,\
the clock has no backlight when the opther instrument lights are on at
night, hence the clock cannot be read in the dark.  My owner's manual 
says nothing much about the clock at all, so I really don't know what
to expect.  Does anyone have any idea of what the problem may be with
my clock?  Any help will be appreciated.
Many thanks.

Subject: How to Join the PCA

[this is also on-line in tta.com:/pub/porschephiles/PCA/How-to-join]

The Mother Ship of Porsche Owners in the US (and if you ask them, the
rest of the world as well...)

The Club ha you affiliate with a local region based on where your
ZIP code falls on their territory map. You *CAN* request to join a
specific region, and you can specify an affilate region or dual membership
in another region. The local regions put on many different events, some
social, some educational, some driving or compeition oriented. The annual
gathering of the whole membership, Parade, features competition for the 
national championships in many events, seminars, a GREAT goodie store,
and one of the most fun weeks you'll experience.

To join, you need to have a Porsche VIN number and be able to claim 
you're an owner, a co-owner, or hold a lease on a Porsche. That may
seem restrictive, particularly if you want to join the club to get access
to Panoramo, the club magazine, for purposes of FINDING a car...
In such case, it's suggested that you purchase a modest fraction of a
friend's car for say $5 or so, hence becoming a co-owner. Just don't tell
them you did that or where you got the idea...

Once you have a VIN number, there are four ways to join:

1) send a letter to the national office saying that you want to join,
   with your name, address, car info and a check for $36 to:

	Porsche Club of Americia.
	P.O. Box 10402
	Alexandria VA 22310

2) call them up at +1 703 922-9300, roughly between 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).
   If you have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy, you can do
   it over the phone. Otherwise, they'll send you an application which you 
   can mail in with your check. This is the FASTEST way, and if you need
   to be a member *RIGHT NOW* to go to an event that is members only, this is
   your best bet. Don't count on using this method the week of or before 
   Parade.....

3) find someone active in your local region. *MANY* of the regions are 
   represented on the Porschephiles list, so that's a good place to start.
   Once you have found someone, get them to put you in touch with the
   local region membership chair, they can give you the form, and off you go.

4) National membership chairman Nann Weissenberger is also on the list, and
   is reachable via e-mail at "nannw@aol.com". She'd be more than happy
   to help you out.

But please join! It's a very worthwhile endeavor.

Adam,

It may, as you and George say, be the MC.  It may also be that you
damaged a hose or line.  Look all the circuits over as carefully
as you can.  And in particular look for wetness.  A failed MC
will often leak out the back and down the face of the vacuum
booster (power booster).  It can also leak into the booster.

Jeff,

One thing perhaps to note is that, I think, Bruce's article said the
studs were aftermarket, not from Porsche.  Which is not to say that,
aha, there's the problem.  But it certainly is possible that a batch
of bad "dilivar" studs made it into the normally reputable wholesale
aftermarket.  It's happened before.

The Raceware stuff has had a fairly brief history, but to date it
seems to be very good stuff.  Other than Bruce, I haven't heard of
anyone, personally, who has used their head studs.

I don't think you need to use dilivar studs all-round, just on the
exhaust side.

Kevin,

Bruce's article is about Porsche Dilavar studs, not after markets studs.
Bruce even says that Porsche was queried about the problem and had no
explanation. Porsche also said the manufacturing process had not changed.

One of three problems: (1) you're running MUCH too high fuel pressure,
and that's causing more gas to flow per unit time than the brain is
expecting, (2) you have one or more injectors stuck open (this could
be from a bad new injector, a piece of crap holding the pintle open, or
a bad wiring harness that's got a short or something, (3) something is
confusing the brain and it thinks you're at much higher RPM than you
really are (so it could be a failed brain *OR* a failed sensor).

Problem is, this takes a high-pressure gauge and a 'scope to diagnose.
Better start looking for someone that has this stuff...

Hmmm. It's a geometry problem, but the question is *WHICH* one .... New
flywheel? Are you sure, or is it a "resurfaced" or "rebuilt" or one
of those other re- words?? A common problem is taking too much off the
flywheel in resurfacing it -- you shave 0.25mm off the face, you also have to
take that much off the pressure plate mounting face, and add that much
to shim the throwout bearing to maintain geometry. For the first 0.25mm
it's not too bad. At about 0.75mm, it's REAL bad... Let me go play
with a tranny tomorrow and see if anything else pops to mind.

I'm very sorry to hear that. It's important to deal with a reputable
shop that will stand by their work. Hopefully, you are dealing with
such an outfit.

Subject: Erratic Tach

Lately, or it seems that since the weather has cooled, my tach has
been acting funky.  At idle, it will sometimes just die and twitch, but if I
rev the motor, it'll jump back up.  Sometimes if I hold a particular
rev for a while, it'll drop and bounce back up and kinda act goofy.

Any ideas what would be causing this?  I really don't have any idea
where to start looking except for maybe connections on the back of
the tach.  I'm not really sure where to look in the engine compartment.

At First Saturday Sale in downtown Dallas, there was a vendor handing
out floppy disks to demo his services.  Unknown to the vendor these
disks were infected with the Natas Virus (in the INSTALL.EXE file.) This
is a fairly nasty poly-morphic virus that *can* trash your hard drive.
It does varying degrees of damage, with a complete crash in roughly
1 out of 500 hard drives.  The demo program was only completed 4 days
ago, but SO FAR, there have been 3 crashed systems and one infected
network.  With several hundred additional demo disks now in
circulation....  the potential is pretty scary.

The free demo disks were 3.5" black floppies with the word "WIN" in
large letters from Winner's International Network.

Please pass this message around, this could be a nasty problem.
The vendor has handed out over TWO THOUSAND disks total, and the virus
is probably wide spread in the DFW community by now.

The virus is polymorphic, uses complex stealth routines, has some tricky
code in it, plus remains memory resident.  It kicks almost *EVERY* flag
in TBSCAN's heuristic mode.

NATAS is very new, and is not recognizable by SCAN, MICROSOFT ANTI-
VIRUS, and CENTRAL POINT. Only F-PROT, TBAV, and AVPRO can find it.

If you have the virus already, it goes memory resident, and uses heavy
polymorphic code to avoid detection.  Chances are, if you're already
infected, virus scanner *might* not find it.  Boot from a clean floppy
containinq a anti-virus scanner, and scan all your drives.

The disk containing the virus has a INSTALL.EXE, which is the infected
file.

This has been verified and is NOT a joke! Scan EVERYTHING you upload or
download from any bbs, or get from any disk!

Subject: removing power temporarily? (944)


Briefly, my poor car has to sit on the street.  I'll be out of town for a 
few days in the next couple of weeks, and I'm leary of leaving it sit in one 
place with a car cover on.  Normally I wouldn't be too worried, as my car 
alarm has an ignition cut off, which would deter the casual car thief.  

However, my 6 year old clifford alarm had it's brains fried out last week 
when my battery went dead because of Ye Olde Fan Cut-Off Switch not 
turning off my fan.  Apparently recharging the battery was too much for 
the old girl.

In any case, I would have replaced it immediately except for clifford's 
wonderful warranty (lifetime), so, off to the factory it goes.  Most 
likely it won't be back in time for my trip.

Which bodes the question:  Can I unhook my battery while I'm gone?  Which 
post should I disconnect?  Are any little diodes in my car going to 
explode and cause me very unhappy master card syndrome?

Thanks much.

Hi, Dennis,

Sure, remove the negative post (the braided non-insulated cable) first and
lay it down in the battery area.

No damage will occur, other than your having to reset the clock and
re-program your radio buttons.

Yes and no.  To quote the man, "recently landed stock purchased from a
reputable Porsche source."  Maybe he meant "purchased from Porsche,"
but there's a difference and that's where you can get bit.

For example, the shop I hand around purchases many, many parts for
Porsches through the wholesale aftermarket, and from one source in
particular.  The deal is that these parts are supposed to be top of
the line, and in particular of exactly the same standard PAG and
PCNA uses for their dealer network parts.  They are bought by the
wholesaler from the OE sources -- ATE, Zimmermann, and so on down
the line.

This is the way every independent mechanic does business.  They do
buy parts from PCNA when a) they're not available anywhere else,
or b) PCNA prices things competitively (it does happen!).  They do
it because Porsche charges too much for their parts, and because
they need to make a buck on the transaction.

You can unhook the negative cable to the battery and tuck it to the

Subject:      928 handling...

I was reading in the AUTOMOTION catalog about a project 928 of theirs that they
, among other things, replaced the springs on.  They claim that their 928 was g
etting .96g's on the skidpad because of the aftermarket springs.  If there was
only one thing I could change on my 928 it would be the cornering performance.
 I was used to my Mom's BMW 318's handling and assumed that my recently acquire

hould I do first, money being an object?  Thanks for any input!  Sean

Another explanation for the flooding in the 914 is that the fuel injection

the distributor. In my 914 when this set failed I had 2 cylinders getting
double doses of gas, and the car ran (and smelled) really bad.

New injector points, and voila! Tout va bien.

This might be a stupid question but I'll ask it anyway......would the 911
"L" model qualify for the "S" registry? The only year that the "L" was
available was 1968 and it was ment to replace "S" since the "S" did not meet
the U.S. emission requirements for that year. The "L" is the same car except
the "S" engine......

Thanks

Hi, Sean, 

I recall reading that the 4 in S4 indicates that it is the 4th generation of
the 928 car.

Subject: Dilavar studs best?

The article (12/94 Excellence, page 32-48) says that the breaking studs
are from Porsche. The article starts with a reader question about a broken
stud in his '86 Carrera (presumably not yet rebuilt with 74,500 miles) and
proceeds to describe failures of "recently landed stock purchased from a
reputable Porsche source. Porsche says that nothing has been changed in
the manufacturing process and they are at a loss as top the cause of the
failures."

Subject: Re: 914 Flooding... Help.

       As you can gather from the responses you've been getting, it
could be a number of things.
       You don't mention if you get any sort of problem under hard
acceleration.  If not, it very probably is the pressure sensor/brain 
thinking you are at full throttle all the time.  The sensor has a 
baffle in it that, if breaks will flood the engine.  Test by undoing
the air hose leading into it from the airbox while at idle.  If it
doesn't flood more at the point, you might have found your problem.
       Second, did the problem start right after the new injectors?
If so, you probably do have too  much fuel pressure in the line.  If
someone ran 1.7 injectors before you they may have dailed up the
pressure to compensate for the smaller opening in the 1.7's. Going
to 2.0 injectors would flood the engine.  If you really suspect this
buy a $12 tire pressure dail gauge with a hose, cut the hose and
hook it to the manifold in place of the hose going to the cold
start valve.   Should be 28.4-29.6. Another posiblity is that 
one or more of the injectors are plugged in backwards.  The plugs 
are unidirectional but a lot of the new injectors are bidirectional.  
Make sure that the angled cuts on the injector plugs are down 
when plugged into the engine.   This wouldn't cause it to run rich
per se, but would cause it to run poorly.  Probaly not the case if
you say it starts better after diconnecting the fuel pump.
       As per an individual injector sticking you could determine 
that by either pulling the injectors with the ignition on (engine off
but fuel system pressurized) and seeing if any are leaking- or by
pulling the spark plug leads one at a time off the plugs (or better
yet, pull the injection wires at the injectors).  The engine 
would run better or the same when you pulled the bad cylinder.
      I know my tests are primative, but I just got back from Spain
where I kept a 914 2.0 going for three years with nothing more
than a small toolbox.

Trond's recent query about tools reminded me of a couple of questions I've 
been meaning to ask:

1) Who, what, and where is "Baum's"? A couple of folks, including the
ListMeister, have mentioned them. Are they the original supplier of most
of the "special tools" sometimes needed for our toys?

2) Does anyone offer discounts on Snap-On? Or, do you generally just pay the
"retail" price through your local dealer?

Thanks in advance!

I looked at an 87 911 Cabrio that had 114K miles, with a new clutch
and valve job.  They are asking $23K - body is in mint condition.  car
drives nice.  I am considering a $20k offer as it is unusual to have valve
work with this kind of mileage.  Any opinions?

Baum Tool is indeed the originator of most of the special tools for
most of the European cars, including all of the VW, Porsche, Audi
family. I have a catalog at the shop, usually just call them up and
the tool arrives COD soon thereafter. If I don't get the number posted
in a few days, remind me.

Rumors of same abound, but I've never seen any worth writing home about.
Paying "retail" through my dealer gets me some serious support -- like
emergency night/weekend tool drops, when I just gotta have something
right then. Of course, some volume helps too...

Hi Philip,

I think the hunting on cold start is normal. Usually it hunts four or
five times and then stabilises around 800-900 RPM. In the manual
it says don't leave it on cold idle, drive as soon as you start, without 
exceeding 4000 RPM in the first five minutes of driving.

I find that when the DME is still running the engine in cold mode,
it is not to brilliant at managing the transition back to idle. Thus, 
`deceleration, throttle-closed, clutch-in, roll to stop'
can beat the DME, which seems unable to react fast enough to go from
it's cold-and-throttle-closed state to it's cold-idle state.

I find the best way to manage this is to use heel and toe to
just blip the throttle whenever you are transitioning
from moving to stopped untill you have some deflection on the 
oil-temp.

Regards

Ben

Subject: 914 handbrake light

Hi, I have a 914 question:

 When the handbrake is on, the light in the dash does not come on. I've 
 never even seen this light on, although at a track day, early in the AM,
 the car's co-owner did see the light blinking for a few seconds once.

I took out the little switch (button) under the handbrake. It is getting 
12V, and when the button is pushed it is not. Isn't this correct behavior?

What should I look for next? Should I take out the gauge in the dash and 
check the connector/light for the handbrake? (Yes, I know, it may not be 
worth much trouble, and I hardly use the handbrake...)

Mark

PS There was a posting asking about rain coming in to someone's 914. We 
had water coming in to the passenger side -- obviously from the window 
top. Simple fix: adjust the window height. I moved it up about 1/4" and it 
is now very snug to the rubber. Whoever posted about water coming in: If 
there is a space between rubber and window top, try this, it might help.

Subject: DIY suspension alignment

There have been some replies lately suggesting that home alignment is not
worth trying. I beg to differ. I have been aligning my '72 911 S since I
bought it over 10 years ago. My 2 SCCA Solo-II National championships and
2-for-2 Porsche Parade fastest stock times prove that it was close enough. I
don't have any special tools : Strings, bubble level, wood, and scientific
calculator are all that are needed.
I don't know what method is used in the booklet which has been discussed, but
if anyone has any questions about different methods I will be glad to give my
opinions. There are several valid methods. I tried the toe measuring method
from Pete Albrecht (?) using string, thumbtacks, and weights on a friend's 66
'stang and it worked great.

This year I had sponsorship from the local Porsche dealer for alignments.
After checking their alignment with my tools, I confirmed that my own
alignments are just as good. Next year I will do all my own alignments, even
though I don't have to pay for them, because it is more convenient to do it
myself, and I can try various settings. It is also important to be able to
check your alignment often. I did not check my alignment at the Porsche
Parade this year, and later found that there was no negative camber in the
right rear, which caused the car to be nearly undriveable. BTW : The culprit
was the 3 old bolts/nuts which hold the spring plate to the trailing arm.
These should be replaced on an older car, as they can lose their
effectiveness after being tighened/loosened many times.

As for corner balancing, this is extremely critical for a good handling
Porsche, and you should use accurate scales or some other method which can be
proven repeatable within a few pounds or so. But there is no reason that this
should not be done at home if you can find an extremely level place to do it.
Just make sure you use the correct formulas : you do NOT want the left side
to weigh the same as the right side, you want the front/rear percentages to
be the same left and right without changing the total left/right balance.
Sorry Scott Winders, who says he and Jim Pasha don't agree with me and Bruce
Anderson and Fred Puhn about corner balancing. Puhn's book "How to make your
car handle" has these formulas along with a nice example of using them.

Here's an interesting example of the importance of corner balancing :
Early this year when I first installed my new suspension, my car would pull
to the left HARD at any speed above 0 MPH. It was as if a ghost was turning
the steering wheel. I finally figured out that is was because of extremely
poor corner balancing : almost all of the car's weight was being held up by
the right front and left rear. The other 2 corners were merely keeping the
car from tilting over! When I jacked up the front of the car from the middle
(near the tow hook) the left front tire rose off the ground quickly, while
the right front remained on the ground until the car was quite high. To
balance the car, the heavy right front and left rear were loosened (lowered)
and the light corners were tightened (raised).

So go ahead and D.I.Y, but be careful out there!

Mail*Link(r) SMTP               944-Coolant Fan Switch Problem

Greetings,
This past weekend I had the misfortune of having my 87 944 not willing to
start.  The battery was completely drained; no dome lights, clock, nothing. 
I connected a battery charger to it and lo and behold, the coolant fan comes
on.  My diagnosis is that the coolant fan switch has failed since the car was
completely cold when I connected the charger.  

I'd appreciate any feedback from those that have had a similar problem and
did the repair themselves.  My questions are as follows.

1.  Could there be another explanation for the failure?
2.  I have a Haynes manual for the car.  I've never done anything but change
the oil and filter but the process of replacing the switch seems fairly
straight forward.  Are there any suggestions to supplement Haynes?#005#  I
don't think I need any special tools.  Is that correct?  Any thoughts/advice
on draining the radiator and refilling it?
3.  Any suggestions on where to order the replacement switch?
4.  Any other thoughts?  If this thread has been addressed by P-philes, then
can someone direct me to the appropriate archive?

Direct e-mail is fine with me, I'll post a summary of the responses if this
thread has not already been addressed.  My address is biesiada1@llnl.gov.

Amen!  For Porsche to ignore the reality of RF devices in today's cars
is to keep their heads firmly embedded in the Weissach sand,

I always ask the question: How did the car get to the used car lot? I think
usually a dealer takes it as a trade-in or something, and can't sell it
because he can't afford to guarantee it because there's something wrong with
it. So he sells it to the used-car guy, who's not going to guarantee it.

If there's nothing wrong with it, the dealer would have sold it instead of
losing the profit by selling at less than retail to the used-car guy.

Just my (perhaps worthless) opinion.

All,
	Having cleaned the mechanism and replaced the mast on my OEM antenna
from my 911SC four months ago the motor has now burnt out. I am convinced that
this was not a good design to begin with as it was never very reliable. My
alternatives now are a replacement OEM unit at $260 from Performance, a cheaper
clone from them at $140 (probably the same as the Automotion one at $190), or
find a generic one at the local generic parts store.

Any words of wisdom ?

Subject: Porsche Owners Club (POC) Info


    Greetings to all,
    
    This is from Stan's request for information regarding the Porsche 
    Owners Club ("POC").
    
    The POC was established in the early 50's and is based in Southern 
    California.  Membership is approximately 800 and the POC publishes a 
    newsletter (35 pages, color cover, event coverage, classifieds) 6 times 
    yearly.  The focus of the Club is time trialing and racing.  Besides 
    the yearly awards banquet, there are no social activities or rallies, 
    and no parking lot slalom events.
    
    The time trial series is approximately 12-14 events, with 6-8 held at 
    our home track, Willow Springs, and the others held at Las Vegas, 
    Phoenix, and Laguna Seca.  The time trial series is ultra-competitive, 
    with considerable emphasis on winning and fast track times.  However, 
    instructors are available at all tracks except Laguna Seca, and 
    showroom stock classes (no sticky tires, stock everything except 
    shocks) are available for all makes of Porsches.  The POC is a great 
    place to learn how to drive fast and feel confident when stepping up to 
    wheel to wheel racing.
    
    In conjunction with the POC time trials, the club sanctions POC Cup 
    races, with rules similar to PCA Club Racing.  There are, however, 
    limited classes available, similar to the A through D structure of the 
    PCA Club Racing modified classes.  Other Cup racing events include 
    night races and 2-3 hour enduros.
    
    Non-members are welcome at all events except Laguna Seca (due to the 
    number of entries).  Also, depending on entrants, non-Porsches are 
    welcome at the time trials.  
    
    To become a member or find out about events, contact the POC hotline at 
    (310) 784-5653.
    
    The mailing address is:

Mail*Link(r) SMTP               944-Coolant Fan Switch Problem

Greetings,
This past weekend I had the misfortune of having my 87 944 not willing to
start.  The battery was completely drained; no dome lights, clock, nothing. 
I connected a battery charger to it and lo and behold, the coolant fan comes
on.  My diagnosis is that the coolant fan switch has failed since the car was
completely cold when I connected the charger.  

I'd appreciate any feedback from those that have had a similar problem and
did the repair themselves.  My questions are as follows.

1.  Could there be another explanation for the failure?
2.  I have a Haynes manual for the car.  I've never done anything but change
the oil and filter but the process of replacing the switch seems fairly
straight forward.  Are there any suggestions to supplement Haynes?#005#  I
don't think I need any special tools.  Is that correct?  Any thoughts/advice
on draining the radiator and refilling it?
3.  Any suggestions on where to order the replacement switch?
4.  Any other thoughts?  If this thread has been addressed by P-philes, then
can someone direct me to the appropriate archive?

Direct e-mail is fine with me, I'll post a summary of the responses if this
thread has not already been addressed.  My address is biesiada1@llnl.gov. 
Thanks in advance,

Amen!  For Porsche to ignore the reality of RF devices in today's cars
is to keep their heads firmly embedded in the Weissach sand,
especially when the major aoutpmakers from Japan and the US are
already a leg up on Porsche in this respect (GAK!).

I always ask the question: How did the car get to the used car lot? I think
usually a dealer takes it as a trade-in or something, and can't sell it
because he can't afford to guarantee it because there's something wrong with
it. So he sells it to the used-car guy, who's not going to guarantee it.

If there's nothing wrong with it, the dealer would have sold it instead of
losing the profit by selling at less than retail to the used-car guy.

Just my (perhaps worthless) opinion.

All,
	Having cleaned the mechanism and replaced the mast on my OEM antenna
from my 911SC four months ago the motor has now burnt out. I am convinced that
this was not a good design to begin with as it was never very reliable. My
alternatives now are a replacement OEM unit at $260 from Performance, a cheaper
clone from them at $140 (probably the same as the Automotion one at $190), or
find a generic one at the local generic parts store.

Any words of wisdom ?

Subject: Porsche Owners Club (POC) Info


    Greetings to all,
    
    This is from Stan's request for information regarding the Porsche 
    Owners Club ("POC").
    
    The POC was established in the early 50's and is based in Southern 
    California.  Membership is approximately 800 and the POC publishes a 
    newsletter (35 pages, color cover, event coverage, classifieds) 6 times 
    yearly.  The focus of the Club is time trialing and racing.  Besides 
    the yearly awards banquet, there are no social activities or rallies, 
    and no parking lot slalom events.
    
    The time trial series is approximately 12-14 events, with 6-8 held at 
    our home track, Willow Springs, and the others held at Las Vegas, 
    Phoenix, and Laguna Seca.  The time trial series is ultra-competitive, 
    with considerable emphasis on winning and fast track times.  However, 
    instructors are available at all tracks except Laguna Seca, and 
    showroom stock classes (no sticky tires, stock everything except 
    shocks) are available for all makes of Porsches.  The POC is a great 
    place to learn how to drive fast and feel confident when stepping up to 
    wheel to wheel racing.
    
    In conjunction with the POC time trials, the club sanctions POC Cup 
    races, with rules similar to PCA Club Racing.  There are, however, 
    limited classes available, similar to the A through D structure of the 
    PCA Club Racing modified classes.  Other Cup racing events include 
    night races and 2-3 hour enduros.
    
    Non-members are welcome at all events except Laguna Seca (due to the 
    number of entries).  Also, depending on entrants, non-Porsches are 
    welcome at the time trials.  
    
    To become a member or find out about events, contact the POC hotline at 
    (310) 784-5653.

Not quite sure this is correct.  Think about it this way.  New car dealer
sells a new $50,000 car.  He is not warrantying anything - manufacturer
does that - dealer get paid for any work.  Ok, now say he takes a car in
on trade.  The books usu. show at least 3 numbers (in order of increasing
magnitude) avg. trade in, avg. wholesale, avg. retail.  Lets say the
dealer takes a car that avg retail is 29,000 and gives 24,000 for it
as trade.  He has now sold a 50,000 for 26,000 and increased his inventory
costs.  He wants to move it quickly, not necessarily because he knows
something is wrong with it, but because he wants the cash.  So, he
sells it to a USED car dealer or broker for 26,000.  Now he's sold a 
50,000 car for 52,000 with a little extra work and he's done.  He doesn't
need to detail, test drive it, inventory it, nothing.  Plus, new car dealers
are new car dealers, they don't want to truck with the used stuff.  There's
damn little profit in the used car anyway (short term cash, insurance,
overhead of the lot, detailing, gas, paying sales folks - all out of the
3,000 in this example - I don't think my numbers are that far off), without
exposing yourself to the risk in warrantying anything.

Subject: [914 Engine] - P & C Contradictions


Recent discussions about 914 engine rebuild have once again given me cause 
to be concerned.  I've heard some contradictory statements about P & C kits,
and would like to clear the air.

At one point, Stan mentioned that the NPR 96mm kit was a decent upgrade for
a 1.7/1.8 type IV engine.  He also mention that he used them himself, along 
with the FAT FI cam, etc.  Recently, he commented that they were "Ok."

Dr 914 stated that the pistons of the last run of NPR kits were "dished"
on top.  What does this mean?  How does is affect the engine?  If my kit is
found to contain "dished" pistons is this something to run away from?  
Something requiring machine work?

As soon as my the crank, rods, flywheel and impeller return from Detroit 
Balancing, I'm going to begin the long and *well-thought-out* process of 
rebuilding the engine for springtime.  

I'm in no hurry, just overly concerned with getting things done right, and
having an engine that runs as best it can.

Check out imparts (800-325-9043). They have an OEM clone from the 
supplier for $49.00 w/silver mast and $69.00 w/black. Genuine Hirshman 
for 86.00 w/silver and 89.00 w/black.

It was <$20K before tax & tags (dealership needed to move inventory, too).

Subject: Re: 914 Flooding... Help.

Dear Josh,
Sorry you have experienced 914 problems, but please don't let them get to you
because they are very minor:
      First the fuel injection problem: it's the head temperature sensor! You
described the problem exactly! Sometimes when the sensor fails, its
resistance varies wildly causing instant enrichment of the mixture and flood
out. You were smart enough to figure out clearing the flooding by removing
the fuel pump relay. After doing this and knowing the engine is clear, simply
ground the control unit lead (where it connects to the  head temperature
sensor) to the negative lead of the battery. This grounding bipasses the
sensor, signaling the control unit that the engine is fully lean and warm.
You can operate your 914 this way until you purchase and install another
sensor. (The sensor is bolted into the right passenger cylinder head under
the right rear intake tube and its wire exits through the engine cylinder
cover.) With the harness grounded here, you may notice the car to be "cranky"
when cold - of course that is because you no longer have cold running
enrichment (resistance from the sensor to signal the control unit) Always
remember that all 914 fuel injection problems are minor ones usually solved
by a good working knowledge of the system and common sense!

Your second problem is not a problem at all! You had been so used to a worn
out high releasing clutch disc, that when a new one was installed releasing
close to the floor as it should, you thought something was wrong! Don't worry
about it and make sure you have some free play (slack) in the cable.
Eventually, as you put miles on your 914, the clutch will release higher and
higher and you will feel comfortable with it. Be happy it releases close to
the floor!

The third problem is a problem. Rebuilt transmission whine, when in gear,
(out of gear whine is a caused by a bad rear wheel bearing) is caused by
improper depth setting of the ring gear and pinion or mismatched gears. Very
special and expensive factory tools are necessary to "set up" the transaxle
and most shops have not made the investment. They guess at the setting when
rebuilding the box, hoping that by using the same color intermediate plate
gasket they will keep the same relation and this sometimes works (we win the
lottery sometimes also, don't we?(Joke)) Next, if the ring gear and pinion is
in good shape and set properly, a gear could be whining. Often when the gear
teeth wear, a shop will substitute one gear with another used one from the
shelf mixing a gear set. This results in a set mismatch, different tolerences
and whine. The solution here, besides expensdrove a 87 911 coupe.

press off with a new teeth set. (recently available within the last 10 years
in the aftermarket) This freshens the gear set to new while retaining the
old, matched set. 

The third transmission complaint is problably not one. When new syncro bands
are installed in a rebuild, the gears are harder to engage as the slider has
to now fit over a fatter ring. The syncros will eventually wear themselves in
and the gears will engage more easily. This condition at least indicates that

Replacing the switch is fairly easy. Helps if you drain the coolant. Also
helps if you remove the fans and shroud. Having a big wrench helps.
I think that it's a 7/8 inch wrench, but when you get the new switch, just
make sure that you have a wrench that fits.

Probably has not been covered before since it is such a trivial task and the
fix is binary (works or doesn't work, no in-between).

I would welcome such an event! But, looking at the BMW MOA, where the
officers have e-mail via GEnie, it doesn't seem to help much unless
they are willing to *EMBRACE* e-mail as a way of doing things. I don't
know about the rest of you, but I've used e-mail daily since 1978, and
over 40% of my total work in any given day is handled via e-mail. That
promotes a VERY different mindset than the old "hmmm. do I plug the modem
or the toaster in here?" that so many neophites have. Plus, there can be
a huge resistance to technological watersheds like this because it 
changes the club dynamics. Sure, you an call Burt Misevik at home any
time you want to --  but how many of the roughly 30K PCA members *HAVE*??
(I'd be the number of Registry members that call officers if MUCH higher,
but a very different ethic is at work in the Registry than the PCA)
On the other hand, if you could drop a note on "burt@pca.org", how many
might do that? My experience says "a lot more". Just look at what has
happened at the Whitehouse now that you can send mail to 
"president@whitehouse.gov" instead of having to write a paper letter...

> 	Has any of the various club mags ever mentioned this list? 

No. On the PCA front, I had discussions with Burt and Judy Boles at
Parade about the list (they'd heard of it via the Excellence article), 
and about what could be done to make access to the 'net more possible/practical
for PCA members. Dennis Thovsen was supposed to work with me on this, but 
since I moved back to TX, nothing has happened. I *DO* know that Betty Jo 
Turner views the 'net as a threat to Pano -- it's real-time versus the 2 
month leadtime that Pano has, an on-line "Mart" could wipe out a significant 
fraction of  member and classified advertising, etc. Given that she's worried,
the other board members are too.  In short, it's a hope that if they don't
deal with a changing world, they won't have to.

On the other hand, Larry Wilson, the newsletter chair, and Nann Wiessenberger,
the membership chair, and other PCA luminaries are not only on the list, but 
think it's a Good Thing -- Larry so much so that he's started a PCA Editors 
list, also hosted at tta.com, with the intent of making it possible for editors 
to get real-time access to otherwise hard-to-come-by articles, pre-typed, so 
as to improve the content of the regional newsletters. (So, if you'd like to 
write a article for wide circulation or if you'd like to help your region
editor, send a note to "larry_wilson@macnexus.org"!!!! It will be appreciated)

On the Registry front, I haven't talked to those guys about this at all.
I've been too busy trying to keep my 356 working to talk 356s!!!!
I *think* that Pete Albrecht has mentioned it to at least Gordon Maltby,

We're over 950 and closing rapidly on 1000. A couple of key technology
changes make it possible to continue to support the mail load (we're
over a gigabit a day of traffic most days), but there needs to be some
effort put into development of "forums" or content scanning mail agents
or SOMETHING so the individual subscribers don't overload. Right now, over
half the new subscribers drop in the first three days, most with a sort
of dazed "wow, that's a lot of information" note.

Subject: Aftermarket Chips


Hi all,

I'm going to reprint a message from PCNA for you all. This concerns 
replacement chips and the new IM 240 testing proceedure that will be used
for specific urban area vehicle emission testing. This procedure uses 
measurement equipment with a much finer resolution than previously
available for field sites. the equipment will now measure NOX and do 
more exacting measurements of HC and CO while using a Dynamometer 
which will load either the front or rear drive wheels, but not both (4WD). 
(959 and Carrera 4s would be exempt from this testing). The test will be 
closer to the original EPA certification test for each model/engine family.

The message:

	"Aftermarket microchips are not recommended by Porsche. They have
	not been tested or approved by Porsche. Their installation may
	result in driveability problems (poor cold starting, hesitation, 
	surge, etc.), excessive emissions and possible engine damage.

	"While Porsche treats each occurance on an individual basis,
	should these or similar problems be found in vehicles using
	aftermarket microchips, warranty assistance will be denied."

	- Bob Carleson, General Manager, Public Relations


Before a bunch of you get excited and deluge Mr. Carlson with calls,
consider this: Even if the device manufacturer claims to meet all
emission criteria, Porsche, the OEM manufacturer of the vehicle, did not 
certify the vehicle with that aftermarket device. They also have, in the 
warranty, a few words about tampering with the emission equipment and the 
voiding of the warranty if this is done. As stated, these are handled on a 
case-by-case basis. 

Remember, the manufacturer has to guarantee that all of the devices will 
operate correctly for 50,000 miles. If any component fails, then they must
replace it. This includes all compnents of the emission system, computer,
engine, catalyst, O2 sensor and exhausive gear set replacement, is to
press off with a new teeth set. (recently available within the last 10 years
in the aftermarket) This freshens the gear set to new while retaining the
old, matched set. 

The third transmission complaint is problably not one. When new syncro bands
are installed in a rebuild, the gears are harder to engage as the slider has
to now fit over a fatter ring. The syncros will eventually wear themselves in
and the gears will engage more easily. This condition at least indicates that
the shop replaced the syncros!

Good luck with your 914, Josh! I hope the transaxle problems work out! Keep
the faith!

There is a clause that permits aftermarket vendors to offer pieces that

devices are certified by the vehicle manufacturer. This is what Mr. Carlson
is pointing out. He is politely bringing our attention to the finer

In this day of tightening emission standards, the buyer should be aware
of these issues when looking at ads or hearing others brag.

Doug and Jerry:

Let me chime in here with my own research/experiences with the issue "What are
the possible wheel/tire combos which will fit on my '87 951?"

I converted last July to 17X8 and 17X9 forged 3-pc Gottis.  I'm running 245/40
and 255/40 D40M2s but since the rears are down to the wear-indicators, (can 
you say 'slicks'?), I will be getting BFG 235/45 and 275/40 ($100 rebate for 
Team T/A members if purchased by 11/30).  I don't anticipate any rubbing 
problems *IF* the fenders are adequately rolled.

Doug: I'm not sure why you're having these rubbing problems (wheel too wide?) 
but I've spoken to several folks in NNJR who've done the same thing.  Eugene 
Hahn runs 9s and 10s Antera wheels (I believe these are cast not forged)
with 235/45 and 275/40 Goodyear GSCS- he didn't need spacers, just rolled the 
rear fenders.   Jerry: E-mail me if you want Eugene's # to discuss further.
This is on an '87; since wheel offset is 52.3mm vs. 23.3mm on an '86, this may
be a factor in rubbing problems, as I have 20mm more to play with.   Oops! 
just re-read your post, Doug - so what is your custom offset ? - in order to 
make a valid comparison. 
On Jerry's '89 951S, I believe with 65mm? offset rear, even more.
Another guy from Metro NY region at Bridgehampton claimed no rolling needed on
his car.  Not sure what year that was but it had air bags so 87+ (they both 
deployed when he didn't turn at turn 5 but climbed the guard-rail instead :( 
).  Doug, didn't you say Tony Henderson was trying 315/35?  It might be worth 
a call for Jerry since he owns a P-shop here in Jersey.

The dished top pistons reduce the compression ratio relative to the flat
top pistons. A dished top is sort of like increasing the volume of the 
combustion chamber.

This should NOT require machine work, directly. It *DOES* mean that, as
always when you change from a factory configuration, you MUST measure
and recalculate the compression ratios. A dished top piston may require
that you shave the head a bit to get the compression up where you want
it.

Jeff,
I have no experience of the studs from Raceware, however I have built me a 2.7
RS spec engine of my 2.4 S -73 engine. I was then very concerned about the
discussion about studs pulling. I had read someware that Porsche from sometime
during -73 or -74 had another material in the lower row of studs. They had
changed due the heat from the heatexchangers. One can read about this in the
Porsches parts catalogue. In time writing I'm not able to check it. It has
worked for me, the climate in Sweden is somewhat cooler though........

Baum's is a specialty tool manufacturer located in Florida. They make tools

full of all those special tools we see in the workshop manuals, but as you 
can imagine, the prices are pretty steep. Another OEM tool manufacturer is 
Zenda Tool in Queens, NY. If you need numbers for either of the above, just

Snap-On    (Are you listening Trond)

Fall Carlisle, I scored a complete set of metric line wrenches, various 
flex-joint 1/4" sockets and an OTC 1/2" drive torque wrench for 1/2 the

   One lesson I've learned is that you get what you pay for with tools. 
The Far Eastern torque wrench I was using to tighten the lug nuts on my

   Any other good professional tool sources out there?

Subject: 914 engine building


	While we are discussing trick 914 motors, what about the high silicon
aluminum pistons which European Racing is (was ?) marketing. As I remember they 
were availiable in 104mm dia and retained stock length skirts to prevent the
scuffing which occurs with other "big bore" pistons. It was my understanding
that these are the same construction as the Keith Black Hypereutectic pistons
which are used in Aluminum small block V8s racing applications of 450-600HP
where they have proven to be reliable. Is anyone familiar with these ? are
they any good ?

BTW I got my '74 2.0 back on the road, Drove it to work today.
Ended up replacing the rear main seal, dowel pin, o-ring, lock plate,
flywheel bolts, pilot bearing, pilot bearing seal, and pressure plate,
and all of the shims which set crank end play. The failure of the
rear main seal was caused by me not pressing the seal far enough when I
put the motor together 2 years ago. The seal was pressed flush with
the back of the case using a hammer and a block of wood and as a result 
rubbed slightly on the radius between the sealing flange and the flywheel 
face; eventually burning the seal. The new seal was pressed using the
correct tool until it bottomed and the result is about .1" more clearance 
at the radius. This leaves the seal contacting only the sealing flange
on the flywheel. Thanks to stan for the guidance.

Yeah, they make *GREAT* paperweights....

Seriously, they're too heavy for high-RPM applications, and still have a 
"slapping" problem common in the other large diameter pistons. Piston
and connecting rod geometry is really, really important in these engines,
and I would not want to use these aftermarket 4" plus pistons on any
engine that I wanted more than a few thousand miles out of...

This is another *CLEAR* case where a vendor is trying to imply that
because something is good for RACING that it's also good for the
STREET. Wise up people -- it IS NOT TRUE!!!

   egads...
     I have a broken stud on the exaust manifold of my 88 951S. It is the very rear
 stud. I made a drill guide and carefully drilled a hole in it for an ez-out. It 
 was far to frozen up to remove(...broken ez-out :( oops...) Well I guess I'm gonna 
 have to pull the head. My questions on this procedure are about the exaust manifold.
 I have the manifold with the expansion accordian in it. How is the best way to get it 
 out once loosened? What are the odds of breaking many of the other studs? and while I
 am doing this I was considering going with the copper headgasket and the Raceware
 head studs. Any opinions on these things? Might do other mods while it is apart also
 who knows.....thanx in advance

Subject: smokin' pig

Yo Pfiles-type people!!

I'm looking for parts; I"m looking for cheaper parts than what Porsche charges
and I'm looking for them now!  I've got a '79 928-pig and I'd like some....

	Oh, that reminds me of a problem I was trying to solve with different 
oil types and weights.  Ok, I've got said 928.  When I'm driving along, picking
my nose and minding my own business, the beast would start smoking bad.  I mean
BAD.  So I figured that oil was being ingested through the air box 'cause the
air box was filled w/oil.  How did it get there?  It got there through the
breather line that attaches to both the airbox and the oil-filler cap.  Can
you explain a little more?  Sure.  But first some history of the car.  This is
a car that was sold through a FBI Seizure auction (wouldn't that be neat; the 
FBI seizing?  "Should'a used some Bel-Ray!") so its history was "suspect", in
more ways than one.  Anyhow, there are two possible ways for the air to be
recirculated from the crankcase and into the oil-filler tube, through a
breather tube and finally into the airbox.  One way was from the the sump.  On
these cars the oil-filler tube has a metal line that connects to a hard rubber
line which feeds into the tob part of the oil pan.  The other way is through
the top of the case, through an aluminum collector connected to a rubber hose
and then back to the oil-filler tube.  Well, it turns out the oil was coming 
from the sump, through the line, into the oil-filler, through the breather hose,
into the airbox and out to Mother Nature (Naturally, whenever it started smoking
I always slowed down and got behind a slow moving Datsun or VW bus; didn't want
the cars following me to think a porsche was killing the air).
But why did it do that?  So I changed from Castrol/GTX 20-50 to Syntec 5/50 but
the same thing happened.  That's why I asked the question re: the oil foaming.
I took apart the FI and emission stuff and found alot of problems; many minor
vacuum leaks, a temperature valve for the EGR system and a vacuum control
valve (decel valve) and ALL vacuum lines were broken, leaking or just not there.
But nothing that would cause a problem w/ the smoke screen; until I cut open the
breather hose that ran from the crankcase breather to the oil-filler cap.  The
hose material inside (heater-hose, by the way) had broken down and blistered
inside so badly that it was difficult to blow air through it.  It looked just
like a clogged artery in need of a Angioplast procedure (you know, the little
ballon that pushes the chloesterol back into the artery walls), but it looked
almost perfect from the outside.  
So, I replaced that hose and about 2 dozen other lines and will see if that
solves the oil-injection problem.  

The moral of the story is:  Just because it looks like it can't possible be the
cause doesn't mean it isn't.

The other moral of the story is:  Just because drug dealers have lots of money
doesn't mean that give a dry fart about taking care of their car.


But I still need two peices that I refuse to pay Porsche prices for.  They are:

1. Thermo (temperature) control valve  $129.00
2. vacuum control (deceleration) valve	$91.00

If anyne out there knows of places that are dismantling a CIS-equipped 928 (79)
please let me know.

Dear Stephen,
Thank you very much for your very complete reply. Having talked to several
people and HRE wheel company I have come to the conclusion that 275/40/17 are
the largest combo that will fit under a STOCK 944 turbo. I emphasize stock
because I know for a fact that some people are running 315's which in my
opinion is a bit much on a stock Turbo S. Since I am limited to stock
bodywork that is the combo that I will try. Thanks for the info and I'll let
you know

Subject: '84 944 Water beneath passenger seat.

Hello,

It's rain time in Vancouver again, and again I've found water behind and
beneath the passenger seat in my '84 944. Last winter, the car sat in the
rain for a few weeks before I got it into a garage and the floor became
totally soaked. I thought I'd fixed the problem by cleaning the seal around
the passenger door, but shortly after cleaning, the rains stopped and I
couldn't tell for sure. Now that the rains are back, it looks as if the
problem is still there. I takes quite a bit of rain to make the carpet wet,
so the leak must be quite small.

Has anyone experienced this problem before (or have any bright ideas) ? If
so, I'd appreciate hearing from you.

There are no obvious water tracks on the interior and the sunroof seal and
drains appear to be ok (I haven't tested the drain yet, it just looks ok).
Sometimes there are a few drops of water on the black plastic vent cover
between the door and fram, but I'm not sure whether they got there before
or after I opened the door (as this is usually done in the rain).

In the meantime, I've cleaned the seal around the door again and treated it
with silicon.

Thanks,
cv

Subject: Re: What to pay for a 76 930 turbo?


Text item: Text_1

Paul,

The lowest I've seen one offered at is $23,000.  This was a very nice '79 with 
about 35K miles, but the seller was VERY anxious to sell (it had been on the 
market for 1/2 year).  I'd say somewhere between this an $30,000 is a fair 
price, depending on the condition.  A '76 should sell for less than a '79.

Check out the condition of the leather, especially the seats and front/rear 
dash.  This is where wear and sun damage show first.  Look for shrinkage, 
cracks, loss of color, and thinning.  If the leather is not in good condition, I
guarantee there is a 930 for sale somewhere out there with better leather.  Look
for a better one if you care.

Paint is another area to look at, but you don't need advice on this.  Just look 
at it.

The '76 did not have an intercooler, and not as powerful as a '78-79.  I would 
suggest the later model.  There are some who think the models without 
intercoolers are less reliable, since the air/fuel mixture is hotter when it 
enters the chamber and is more likely to detonate early.  I don't have any 
advice on this point.

Things to watch out for are oil leaks.  An oil leak by the turbo means the turbo
will have to be rebuilt.  Leaks around engine gaskets are worse, since major 
engine work is needed to replace the gaskets.

If (and only if) the oil has not been changed recently, change it.  Look at the 
condition of the oil in the engine and transmission.  Look out for sludge and 
metal shavings.   This could be signs of problems in the future.

Other than these areas, most other problems are minor by comparison.

Good luck.  Let us know what you decide on!

Thanks to everyone for the quick replies! the solution..
as i checked the brake fluid reservoir, everything looked OK, but when i 
opened it up, i  was greeted by a hell-raising vaccuum decompression 
noise.. very similar to opening a hot radiator.. i'd never heard this 
before from my brake reservoir...
And much to my surprise, the brakes were back to their wonderfully stiff, 
old selves.  Any idea how this happened?  I didn't note any leaks on my 
initial inspection, but i'll probably check her out more thoroughly tomorrow.

On  a totally unrelated subject (which i'll include here to cut down on 
bandwidth..) .. my power steering rack has had a hole in it for about two 
years.. I disconnected the PS belt, and have been steering manually ever 
since.  While unassisted steering IS a porsche tradition, and my biceps 
have never been larger, i'm getting awfully tired of trying to parallel 
park this beast.  Anyone know how much a used power steering rack goes 
for, and how much it would be to install... the dealer quoted me a price 
of almost $2k two years ago.. when i regained consciousness, i told him 
i'd think about it. :)

Subject: Broken Stud Repair I of 2

 Friends,

	I see lots of messages like the one below, and am inclined to believe
	it is time to put together a list of do's and don'ts when removing
 	broken studs and bolts, as this is the nature of the Porsche Beast, 
	and perhaps one of the least understood operations in their maintenance
	and repair.

    "egads...
     	I have a broken stud on the exaust manifold of my 88 951S. It is the 
	very rearstud. I made a drill guide and carefully drilled a hole in 
	it for an ez-out. It was far to frozen up to remove(...broken ez-out 
	:( oops...) Well I guess I'm gonna have to pull the head. My questions 
	on this procedure are about the exaust manifold...."
	
	The following sugestions are my best recollection as to the cause 
	and proper procedures to remedy said conditions. 
	All sugestions that contribute to the understanding are welcome!

The Problem:
	Stud, or bolt seized in cast material, in most Porsche instances
	the cast material is an aluminum alloy.
Environment:
	Disimilar materials, ie. steel and alluminum in a hostile environmet
	ie, extremely hot conditions, as in 911 exhaust manifold bolts & nuts, 
	hot coolant with corosion by-products, as in water cooled head bolts,
	water pump securing bolts, (928), and not to be excluded steel bolts
	in cast iron as in Turbo exhaust flanges, probaly both hot and 
	corrosive.
Cause:
	Corrosive growth which causes interferance between threaded 
	dissimilar metals. Both Oxides of Alluminum and Iron are formed
	and the crystals of both get extremely intermingled in a matrix,
	binding the two parts together. In the Iron/Steel problem it is
	Oxides of Iron involved.
Avoidance:
	When dissasembling suspect items treat first with your favorite
	lubricant, many of you already have a product made for penetrating
	the oxide and providing some lubrication. 

	Learn to recognize when you are about to break off the offending 
	bolt/stud.
		1) High tourque, and 
		2) Soggy feel as wrench BEGINS to yeild the fastener in
		   torsion.
	I tend to retighten the bolt after I get some initial yeild as a
	test to see if I've removed some of the bolts preload, or am merely
	failing the bolt in torsion, ie work the bolt back and forth.
	If not, ie. tightening tourque = loosening tourque then, I'm breaking
	the bolt. DON'T GIVE UP!

	APPLY MORE OIL OR A MORE AGRESSIVE PENETRATING OIL, AND AID IT IN IT'S
	ATTEMPT TO PENETRATE.
	What will help the Oil to penetrate?
		In order of preference:

		1) Time, basically this is a diffusion problem.
		
		2) Heat, With different metals ie, Al and Fe, temperature
		   causes the Aluminum to grow "bigger" that the steel
		   allowing spaces for the oil to move into.

		3) Shock, To break up oxides, impact (hammer) axialy on end
		   of bolt, use a punch.

		4) Motion, wiggle the bolt back and forth.

	The key is no.1, Time is your best bet, plan ahead and use lots
	of penetrating oil.

Avoidance Tip No.2
	If it's a nut on a stud, and it's not moving, get a Nut Breaker.
	Nuts are cheap and easy to replace, so it it looks like a possible
	Stud Breaker, Break or cut the nut off! Use a Cold Chisel parralell
	to the Stud to split the nut, or back up the nut with a mass and
	chisel it radially.( I've even use a cutting tourch to neatly burn 
	one side of the offending nut off! use caution)
	Simple Solution to the difficult problem of Possible broken Stud. 
	You should replace the old nut on reassembly anyway! If you break 
	off the stud then you have to buy a stud and a nut!

When It Breaks, to be continued:

Broken Stud Removal

WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS:
	We all have broken them damn bolts off, even when we've used
	all the best practices, and if you claim not, then you're a liar!

	So you've broken off the exhaust manifold stud! DAMN!
	Let's presume it is easily accessable and it can be drilled out.
	You may have to remove some ancillary parts to give you access
	but what else have you got to do?
	
	How to best drill it out?
		1) What size drill? This is important! Your drill size needs
		to be smaller than the TAP DRILL size! How much smaller?
		Figure at least 1mm smaller in dia. for a 10mm stud, this
		leaves .5 mm on each side of stud for easy-out to grab into,
	 	bigger stud, allow more meat, say 2mm for 13mm to 3mm for
		15mm dia. stud, you should leave .5 to 1.5 mm of wall for
		the extracter to work on.
		
		2) Use a drill guide of some sort, you may have to fabriciate
		something, but if you don't then you are at risk of ruining
		the Casting. If the stud has broken off below flush, then
		center punch it to help the drill get a start, and provide
		a guide!
		Use an insert in the old bolt hole of the flange as a guide.
		Easily made in a lathe, turn Outside Dia to fit into the
		old bolt hole, and drill out the center with the same size
		drill you intend to drill out the bolt.
		This will insure you are on center, and provide some guidance
		to keep your drill parrallel (I know it's got lots of l's) 
		to the bolts axis.

		USE A NEW SHARP DRILL BIT!

		If the stud is broken off above the surface, use you ingenuity
		to construct a guide, or grind it flush, realy! then procede
		as above!

		3) Drill all the way through the stud/bolt. This is 
		important for two reasons:
			1. Allows extracter to get it's designed 
			   engagement without bottoming out.

			2. Allows application of penetrating oil
			   to opposite end of frozen threads. (Hah!)

		Don't worry, there is always "empty room" at the bottom of the 
		tapped hole! Think about how the tapped hole was made.

		4) Apply more Penetrating Oil! Let it work, you're not going
		 anywhere soon any way, so take a break! Also it can use heat
		at this time too. MORE OIL!

		5) Insert the extraction tool and TORQUE carefully into
		the drilled hole. Use a tool which allows you to apply 
		torque only, like a Tap Handle, Don't use a Cresent Wrench.
		Be carefull not to apply any bending loads to the extractor,
		this guy is made of hardened tool steel, similar to a Tap,
		treat it similarly. It WILL break off if it gets bent!
		Go Slowly, Again, I try to Wiggle it out, Torque it back 
		and forth to gradually break up the oxides, and introduce
		lubricant into the threads. DON'T BREAK OFF THE EXTRACTOR!

		6) IF the above didn't work, and the extractor is not
		broken off and stuck, the you can try to increase the drill
		size in increments up to the Tap Drill size. Again drill
		all the way through the bolt! And use a new drill guide
		for each drill size!
		If Succesfull you now have a helical coil of metal which
		is the remnant of the Old Bolt/Stud thread in the alluminum
		casting and you can carefully pick it out with a sharp,
		hard dental tool or pick. 
		I've been lucky enough to pick up one end, and have the 
		rest of it come out like a spring, then there's the rest of 
		the times!
		Chase the threads with a tap of same size, use lots of cutting
		oil.

		7) Last resort is to drill out oversize and repair with
		a threaded insert.

	OK you experts, tell me of your experiences of what works!

So, what is there to be confused about??? As I've said a zillion times,
vendors are in business to SELL STUFF, not to make your life easier.
There are things that are in fashion (like stainless steel valves, and
multimedia applications, and ISDN) and there is the Right Way. Some
of the fashionable stuff actually works for some application or another.
*NONE* of them provide adequate replacement for original equipment.

Are you really so naive as to think that stainless steel valves didn't
exist when the 2.0 was designed??? Ever have a look at the exhaust valves
on a 1.7 or 1.8?? They're hardened high-carbon steel. Some people would
call them "stainless steel" and *ALMOST* be right. The 2.0 heads have
sodium valves for a very, very good reason: it improves heat flow from
the valves to the head. If you don't use sodium valves, and PARTICULARLY
if you don't use sodium valves and do other things to boost the heat
of combustion (aka "power" to the unwashed masses), you *WILL* burn the
valves. Period. 

FAT doesn't care if you know this or not -- odds are you'll sell the
car or break the engine some other way before this becomes a problem.
And odds are you'll send the heads back to them because they did such
a great job last time. FAT has some of the best products and machine
shop services around, but only if you know how to use them.

Stay with stock valve sizes and stock valve TYPES on all Porsches!

Jesus Christ on a pogo stick! Next thing you know someone will be wanting
to know why he can't put 44mm Manley titanium valves in because they
do such a good job on the NASCAR circuit...

Subject: Which synthetic oil?

Hi fellow Porschephiles,

I probably should be asking this question in alt.rec.autos but I would like
to receive some informed responses. I need to change my oil soon and thought
that I would switch to synthetic just to give it a try. Now my question:

Which synthetic motor oil should I use? 
I'm leaning towards Mobil 1 because it is easy to find and I haven't heard
anything bad about it. I have heard some good things about Amsoil, but have
also heard that some of it is just exaggerated marketings. When we lived in
California, we used Swepco but that isn't available here. Does anybody have
any suggestions or comments?  Is there one that  I am overlooking?

Last question- what  grade should I use. Winter is approaching so the
temperature will be plummeting into the 50s and 60s ;-).  (in Miami, FL.
Actually we are are currently dealing with tropical storm or is it depression
Gordon which is exposing the leaks in my targa top). Any way can I stay with
20W/50 or would going to10W/30 better (especially since it's available at
Costco for  $20 for 6 quarts)?

Thanks for all your answers.

bPeter-

For what it's worth, I thing Ray's booklet is well worth the 
money.  Like someone has said, it's worth it if only because 
it will teach you what all the adjustments are about.  It's 
one thing to read about them in academic terms, like in 
Puhn's book, and another to read about them when they 
are specific to a 911.  

It's also worth it because it will enable you to do a very 
decent alignment.  Like almost anything else, if you do it 
yourself you can fuss and worry about small details, and get 
it right.  If you take it to a shop they may fuss like you will, 
and their gear may be recently calibrated and accurate, but 
they may not, and it might not.  How do you know?

There really isn't a whole lot of magic to the whole thing.  
It's pretty straightforward.  If you want to know more about 
aligning your Porsche,
get his booklet.

Subject: Public Transportation in Stuttgart 


Some time back someone about to vacation in Germany inquired about public 
transportation in and around Stuttgart. 
 
Like most of western Europe, public transportation in Stuttgart is 
outstanding.   
The factory is located in Zuffenhausen, an easy 30 minute train ride from the 
center of Stuttgart and there is a stop literally at the factory door. 
 
In fact, the last time we went to Europe we used public transportation 
exclusively throughtout Germany, Austria and Hungary and enjoyed every moment 
of it.  
 
By the way, while many people with whom we spoke couldn't say enough about the 
thrill of driving a car at high spped on the autobaun, the unbelievable cost 
of renting a high performance vehicle in Germany just didn't seem worth it to 
us and we had no intention of getting out on that road in a VW Polo!

Chris,

One source you mention is in fact Zelenda Machine & Tools, in Forest
Hills NY.  718 896 2288 or 800 221 0126.  They sell VW and Audi tools,
although as you know a lot of those tools are appropriate for Porsches.

Another source is Assenmacher Specialty Tools, in Boulder, Colorado.
303 530 2424 or 800 525 2943.  In Massachusetts, Bel-Metric is now
distributing Assenmacher tools, 800 544 1624.

Any time you absoutely have to have one of these special tools, you

Cornelius,

I think you ought to check the drain hoses.  There are four, and they
run from the sunroof frame.  Two go down the front A pillars, two
down the rear C pillars.  The right-side rear hose is interrupted
with a Y fitting which joins up the drain from under the gas filler.

Getting to the hoses is sort of a pain.

	Here in the UK, I've read a few articles that suggest that Porsche
dealers make much more of their profit from *used* cars than they do from
*new* ones. The profit margins on new Porsches has been pretty tight over
the last couple of years, but all the dealers tend to advertise quite a
selection of used cars, and their prices are much higher than private
deals, so despite the overheads there must be a profit to be made.

Subject: Re: [914 Engine] - P & C Contradictions

Dear Jerry

NPR (Nippon Piston Ring) built a decent piston and cylinder kit for 356, 912
and 914 engines in the larger bore size 96mm for 914s. They discontinued
building these sets about one year ago. The "dished" pistons I was speaking
of were the 2.0 litre 96mm. Both the 1.8 and 1.7 are flat top. The more
concave, the lower the compression. NPR 2.0 pistons were in the later run
specifically concaved on top to reduce the compression ratio (I suppose to
pass U.S. emmission standards). The higher the compression and displacement,
the more power the engine produces. NPR kits are still available from
suppliers who purchased the last kits and, in the 1.8 variety, perfectly
acceptable, providing good power and durability. We do not like the 1.7 NPR
kit because the cylinder walls are so thin they cause the engine to run
hotter and the cylinders are difficult to seal to the engine cylinder head.
We would rather cut the 1.7 head larger and use the 1.8 NPR kit on a 1.7
engine than to chance using the 1.7 thin walled kit. (the 1.8 kit will bolt
directly to the 1.7 rods and case)

No machining has ever been required to install the NPR "bigbore, 96mm kit" on
a 914 engine. Jerry, tell me your engine size and particulars requirements
and I will tell you the best combination!

After spending several hours last night trying to straighten out my

the transmission and not in the linkage between it and the shifter.  

So this AM I had AAA pick up the car and take to my mechanic.  He diagnosed
it as the car being in both first and reverse.  He said he has seen several
times and that he should be able to correct it through the inspection plate
without pulling the tranny/engine.  

Has anyone else ever had this happen to them?

I have a 44 also and every year when the humidity and temparture drop (don't 
flame me if this has no bearing) my hatch sweaks also. Adjusting the latches 
is definitely the first task. After this I recommend greasing the latches 
and  siliconing the seals next to them.

There is bulb on the back of the clock that probably burned out.  You can

Subject: Kempton Brothers

Anyone ordered parts from these guys before?

I just had a very strange experience, thought I'd share to see if I'm 
being totally irrational.

The December Excellence, p. 121 and the most recent ad in Pano contain 
the following tidbits:

Top of the full page ad:  "Order 2 or more parts from this ad and 
receive a 20% discount".

I order:

Wiper motor:  $40
Gas pedal:  $5
Light switch:  $20 (not in ad, just needed one--I didn't even get a 
price quote when I placed the order).

My invoice shows up, with the following prices:

Wiper motor:  $50
Gas pedal:  $5
Light Switch:  $20
Discount:  $15
Handling: $2

(which works out just fine if you do the math, except for the fact that 
the wiper motor was more than the ad price).

So, I'm curious.  There is an inconsistency in the billing relative to 
the ad.  Being a software tester for a living, this looks like a 'bug' 
to me.  The money isn't a big deal, I just want to understand their 
process.  So I call customer service.  The guy is *immediately* hostile 
when I say the invoice price and the ad price don't match.  He gets 
puts me on hold, then comes back and explains that the discount only 
applies to two or more of the *same* parts ordered from the ad (this to 
avoid the 'buy a motor and a gas pedal, get 20% off the motor' 
phenomenon).  I say fine, but I'm still curious why the part price is 
higher.  He explains that he took the total w/o the discount, which 
would have been $65 and then took off $5.  I explain that my invoice 
doesn't read like that.  More hostility, as though it's my problem, not 
his.  Eventually, he hangs up accusing me of being cheap and he doesn't 
want any more of my money anyway.

This being the first time I've purchased use parts, did I violate some 
unwritten law when dealing with parts guys that says you shouldn't 
dicker over the details, just be glad you got the parts at all?

Steve,

I think the problem is the smaller torsion bars on the 86s. in major big
turns, the sway bars are not enough to keep the body roll from hitting the
tire. Unless the suspension has a lot of slop (could the bushings have been
stiffened in later cars?) I've space the tires ALL the way out so that they
hit the fender lip-and they still hit the inside. the rolled fender lip on
the later cars would not buy enough space, its maybe 3/16 or 1/4" for the
lip. Anybody know the spring and shock rates for the various years?

There is another way to go that we have used. If you have a competant 
welding shop nearby, the expert can heliarc a nut to the broken end of 
the stud. First, get a clean surface to weld to by cutting off the broken 
end. We have done this successfully with as little as 3/4" of the stud 
showing. Make sure you heat the case  around the stud to melt the 
Locktite (and also expand the aluminum or magnesium). Keeping the 
nut/stud cool while doing this will releave some of the tension 
holding in the stud. After you get the case "mushy" (the welder's 
term, not mine -- I must confess I was nervous at this point) 
you can hopefully back out the stud.
p.s. According to my welder Dilivar seems to weld much like stainless.

The turbo-look package was a $13,400 option on my 88 targa.  It had
pretty much everything from the stock 930 except the turbo and the
930 tie rods.  This included whale tail and front air dam, drilled/slotted
4-piston caliper brakes, the heavier suspension components, flared
wheel wells front and rear to accommodate the 7" and 9" wheels
(16" dia.; fronts are the usual 205/55 and rears are 245/45).

From a driver's perspective I always felt the turbo look outhandled the
stock pkg, but seemed somewhat slower accelerating, perhaps due to the
extra weight.  It was also somewhat more stable at speeds over 100mph
than my 89 coupe (w/ Carrera tail pkg).

Used factory turbo look 911's, like cabriolets, usually go for about
20-25% more.

My crusie control has been acting up. I think the symptoms are pretty

300E (I know this is the plist, but you guys are the biggest list of 
mechanically savvy that I know of).

The cruise control is going in and out.

I'm going along with cc set and I can feel the car speeding up and 
slowing down slightly about every 1-2 seconds. It pretty much stays at 
the set 
speed, but it don't feel good. And actually, a couple of times, the cc 
has completely disengaged.

Has anyone had this before ? Is there something I can do with simple 
tools under the hood ? Or what kind of bite will a repair shop take ?

Also, can anyone reccomend a good german car mechanic in the 
portland/beaverton/hillsboro area.

Also, can anyone recommend a good book on do-it-yourself stuff for a 
300E ?

Thanks. I'll go away now...

My opinion is it's worth about $23K-$25K. Am I about right?

Minh Le

========

Minh,

I recently sold my 88 w/ 117k miles, in *terrific* shape, for $26.5k.
It had the advantages of an 87-on (G50 tranny, hydraulic clutch,
improved ventilation) and 86-on (heavier sways and torsion bars).
The early factory turbo looks had welded-on flares, not one piece
units.  I'm not sure what year this changed but I know the 84's were
welded.

This car has lower mileage, but it is offset by the accident damage
(no matter how well it was repaired the gen'l rule is that damaged/
altered 911's suffer about a 20% reduction in value).  Lots of painted
panels makes me suspicious about the extent of the damage.

Needs a clutch?  Figure $1500 to do it right.  First gear grinds?
It shouldn't.  Rebuild the tranny at clutch-time.

I'd estimate a fair price would be $21k.  But lots to check out first.

Well, *IF* the numbers are right and *IF* VW and Porsche Pimp didn't drool
over their advertiser so much that the ink ran and they couldn't read
their notes, then it might be worth checking out. Some info still remains
missing, like ring types/weight/land construction, ditto for the wrist
pin, is it an offset piston, how much cold clearance does it need being
a forged piston (cause of MOST of the piston slap you here in modified engines)
and about a zillion other things.

And doing the math, I get that with a stock 66cc head, it should give you 
a compression ratio of under 7.5:1. If you take another 1mm out of the deck 
height, you get to nearly 8:1 which is a little more exciting. For high-rev
applications, you'd want the lighter short skirt version, for sure. But
then, it won't be legal in any normally sanctioned venue I know of, except
PCA club racing in the "run what you brung" classes.

Now, what does this do for power... Let's see, using an *OLD* rule-of-thumb
calculation and assuming same internal drag (*NOT* true, given larger pumping
effect from larger pistons moving more air in the case), it should give about
another 5-7% power at the same compression.

I'd say it might be worth building as a street engine, and then tearing down 
in say 10k and 20k miles to see how it's doing. Someone wants to pay for it,
I'd be happy to do same...

Ed,

If it's in good shape I wouldn't worry about much.  The 86 was the last year
of the 915 tranny so it doesn't have the supposedly bullet-proof G50 or the
hydraulic clutch.  Frankly I didn't notice too much difference, comparing my
84 cab to the 88 turbo-look or the 89 coupe.  But the 84 was always a low
mileage car and the 88 was sold at 117k with the original clutch and tranny,
so maybe durability is an issue, though I haven't heard much about this.

Cab tops should be considered "replacement items".  The plastic window
scratches and clouds (and is difficult to replace), the headliner wears
badly (especially if the boot wasn't used regularly), the boot snaps break,
etc.  Mine was a manual top, which I prefer over the electric with its heavy
motor and only semi-automatic operation anyway.

Two things I didn't like about the cab: it had mushy handling (lack of
rigidity partly due to the smaller sways and torsion bars of pre-86 911's
but obviously due to the lack of a structural top too), and I felt the car
was
too exposed to vandalism (though I was lucky/careful).

Carreras are wonderfully solid, reliable 911's.  Full records should help
give you confidence about this.  61k miles is adolescence.

Subject: Leaky 944 seals and '76 930 prices

Leaky 944 seals (embarrassing story follows): My '86 951 also had pools of 
water in it after a hard rain. My initial response was to leave it parked 
under a tree. This actually worked most of the time. One day I inspected 
the seals and found that the outside ones along the beltline of the car had 
visible wrinkles in them. I stuck my car key in the wrinkle and it opened, 
exposing a crack. As an experiment, I ran my key along the legth of the the 
window, really opening the crack. The next time it rained, the car REALLY 
leaked. I waited for a dry day, went to the auto parts stores and bought a 
tube of clear weather stripping repair material. I put a bead of the 
material on the crack, using my car key the hold it open, while dragging it 
along the length of the crack. I then wrapped the car key in a napkin, 
jammed the napkin-key between the window seal and the window, ran it along 
the window while smoothing the repair with the excess napkin, and soaking 
up the excess material. This repair has held up to this day. I hope to get 
in there this winter to replace all the seals though.

'76 930 prices - This is first year that the 930 was imported to the US. 
That combined with 35K miles prduces a legitimate potential collector's 
item. Unfortunately, missing intercoolers, less displacement, seal cooking 
thermal reactors, less refined handling, turbo lag, etc. make later cars 
better drivers. I have seen used-up runners go for $12K, non-runners go for 
$7K, and actual nice cars go for mid $20K's. An original, unmodified, 
perfect investment quality vehicle would go for much more. My advice - 
Since it is your uncle and since the car is a potential black hole of 
expense, offer him $15K. Maybe you can both walk away happy.

This is absolute nonsense.  My factory manual (Carrera) states to begin

I have two covers, one made from Kimberly Clark evolution 3 and another

are washable as follows:

1.  Use large tub automatic washer (avoid those with center agitators).
2.  Use 2 cups (actually 1/2 cup works better) liquid Fantastic all purpose
cleaner ONLY.
3.  Wash using normal or permanent press cycles in warm water DO NOT USE
HOT WATER.
4.  Use two rinse cycles to remove all the cleaner (that's why I use 1/2 cup).
5.  Air dry or tumble dry in LOW heat

I've also washed it on the vehicles scrubbing it like I'm washing the car
then removing it to finish the car.  That's too messy for me though.

For some reason, Porsche recommends using the vent line only on 85.5
cars and later.  Not sure why they're against it on earlier cars.  Perhaps 
it
is because of some treatment/sealing of the fender metal.

long clutch and transmission life as well as saving your leg from fatigue!
Many a clutch tube has ripped loose from the strain of an improperly
installed cable. Proper clutch cable installation is as follows:
1. Jack the 914 on the engine mounting bar high enough so you can roll under
it and work. Support it with two jack stands under the jacking donuts.
2. Remove the driver's floor carpet, pedal pads, center carpeting, front
black access plate and wooden floor board.
3. Remove the rear 11mm clutch adjusting nut at the fork, the clutch cable
wedge in the fork and the nut on the roller assembly.
4. Free the banjo clip from the roller assembly and remove the cable and
roller from the housing. Slide the old clutch cable boot off (if it is still
there!) and save.
5. Unclip the clevis pin from the front clutch cable fork and remove. Pull
the cable forward and unscrew the clutch cable fork and locking nut from the
clutch cable end. Push out the clevis bushing from the pedal cluster.
6. Remove the cable from the back firewall. Carefully inspect the back
firewall at this time. Make sure the tube is protruding and there is no
 evidence of firewall cracking evident. If there is, or the tube is not
protruding (you just see a hole), proceed to review the "Clutch Tube Repair
Procedure".
7. Using WD-40 with a spray wand attachment, spray down the tube. This
lubricates the inside of the tube, helps eliminate rust and coats the inside
of the tube for easier cable installation.
8. Select the proper clutch cable:  There are three to choose from. (1) The
original 914-4 which has the exposed cable, surrounded with a white catheter
and protruding from the black sheath. (2) The 914-6 cable which is heavier
than the "four" cable and does not have the white catheter. (3) The
aftermarket "Terry" cable which uses aircraft quality cabling. We always
select the 914-6 cable. It is heavier duty than its four brother and is of
the proper length (we always find the Terry cables to have too much cable and
to be very expensive!)
9. Lubricate the chosen cable with grease (lightly but thoroughly; you don't
want it attracting too much dirt) and install into the rear firewall tube
pushing it all the way forward until the gold collar engages with the
protruding  tube.
10. Reach through the front access cover and center tunnel and feel for the
front end of the cable. Install the locking nut and clutch cable fork (make
sure the fork is not cracked!) Screw the fork on until the cable threads
protrude 10mm into the fork base. Lock the nut against the fork.
11. Replace and grease the clevis bushing in the pedal cluster (The old one
was probably egg-shaped). Carefully inspect the clevis pin, then connect the
cable fork to the cluster and pin it. Be very careful not to wrap the cable
around the accelerator cable! If you do, everytime you disengage the clutch,
the engine will rev! (It now may be a good time to vacuum this area!)
12. Reinstall the wooden floor board, access plate center tunnel carpeting
and pedal pads. Leave out the driver's carpeting for clutch pedal stop
adjustment.
13. At the back of the cable, install the banjo clip and clutch cable boot.
14. Thoroughly clean the roller and roller assembly. Lightly grease the
roller pivot.
15. Install the clutch cable into the roller housing notch and bend the banjo
clip around the assembly until the point of the banjo clip fits into the hole
in the back of the roller assembly. Snug up the clutch cable boot.
16. Wrap the cable around the roller and install onto the roller pivot.
Tighten the nut and then guide the cable into the fork, securing it with the
clutch cable wedge and 11mm nyloc. Make sure the wedge is the new factory
steel style. 914s were originally fitted with a plastic wedge that often
broke, stranding the motorist!
17. Tight the 11mm nyloc nut until the clutch pedal is at the very top of its
travel. One should not be able to pull the pedal up any farther. The pedal
will have tension on it but for the first 1/2" - 3/4" have much less tension.
This lesser tension is called free play as the pedal is taking up cable
assembly slack before actually causing the clutch arm to engage the throwout
bearing. This free play keeps the throwout bearing from wearing against the
pressure plate fingers.
NOTE:  If for some reason you run out of adjustment and have to stack washers
under the threaded end to achieve adjustment, the clutch tube is broken in
the tunnel. Again, refer to the "Clutch Tube Repair Procedure".
18. Adjust the clutch cable stop:  Thoroughly warm the car and idle at 950
RPM. Push the clutch pedal forward until first and reverse gear will engage
smoothly without grinding against the pedal. Tighten the stop to the point
where it rests against the depressed pedal. Reinstall the driver's carpeting.
19. By now you should have a very easy pushing clutch pedal and good
disengagement of gears. Shortly you may need to readjust the cable after it
stretches out its newness. From then on periodically recheck free play and
adjust. This should not be a common occurance unless the cable begins to
strand (break) or the clutch tube is ripping loose.

These mirrors are available from Tweeks 1-800-421-3776

Tweeks part # 826B Exterior mirror 1972-76, chrome, rectangular, $130.99

            # 826E Seal for above mirror, $5.76

I don't believe that these are OEM, but from the picture they look very
similar.  Good luck in your quest.  Remember that they switched to these
rectangular mirrors in 1972 so if you have an earlier 911/12 it won't look
original

From: Dr914@aol.com
Subject: Re: 914 handbrake light

Dear Mark

I do not remember the year of your 914, but the handbrake warning light works
in two ways:
  1. To signal that the handbrake is engaged:  The handbrake button is under
the lever and screwed into the frame rail. It is grounded when the lever is
up. The button grounds the brown with yellow striped wire engaging the
flasher unit to flash the red light above the fuel gauge. Sometimes the
button sticks or the wire grounds and the light flashes intermittantly.
  2. To signal a loss of brake pressure. Ever notice that after brake pad
replacement that the emergency brake warning light flashes? Ever notice a
strange clicking under the dash? The master cylinder brake warning switch has
flipped due to a momentary loss of brake fluid pressure! Resetting is
accomplished by bleeding the brakes (usually on 74-76 model 914's, or
removing the steering rack cover and pushing the reset button on 70-73
models).

I suggest that under track conditions, the fluid heated and caused a
temporary brake fluid pressure drop. When the fluid cooled things were back
to normal. You may also notice this condition when the pedal travels much
further than normal when engaging the brakes (again low pressure!)

If thats true, why not run a hose all the way down the hole and out the
other end? that way you won't dissolve any sealant...The general idea seems
to be to get the overflow away from the battery tray. otherwise it sounds
like the problems the 914 people have.

Just a note on a performance enhancement to this process:
I have done a few cable R&R's, and have found that if I tie
a strong (kevlar, as it was) thread to the cable before pulling it through,
I can then tie the thread to a new cable (false economy to use the old one)
or if using the old one, just use the thread to help pull the cable
back into place. It makes those odd angles much easier to negotiate, and
reduces the use of vile language by a significant margin.

Subject: Re: Kempton Brothers

Marc,

I have had some problems with Kempton also.......

...I bought a set of rebuilt heads from them for my 928.
I received them and proceeded to install them.  After installing them the
engine had a coolant leak into one of the cylinders, suspecting poor
installation by me of the head gasket, I removed the head and replaced the
gasket.
Hmmmm still leaking.....
Remove the head, check the block surface...looks OK.

Check the mating surface on the head with a dial indicator and.....WOW....it
looks like the surface of the moon. (about 10x spec on flatness)

I call them up ( a little annoyed that I went through all this to find the
head bad )  the guy on the other end of the phone was very hostile.  He tells
me I have had the head too long to return it(I can't remember how long I had
it now but it was a couple days past their return policy time)...I go a
little crazy on the phone with him and he grudgingly tells me to return the
head and  agrees to replace it....a couple of weeks later I get the new head.

I guess I don't quite understand the hostile attitude, life is too short to
deal with that kind of attitude, especially since they obviously screwed up.
 I don't suspect I will do business with them again.

I guess I also learned, when buying used or rebuilt equipment thoroughly
check it out prior to installation.  This could save you quite a bit of pain
and anguish.

I have had pretty good luck with AAA Small Car World in Texas.  I don't hear
it mentioned much here.

Hi, Jim.
 
>egads ... I have a broken stud on the exhaust manifold of my 88 951 S.
 
What are your plans for removing the stud, and now the stud remover, once
you have the heads off?
 
This thread surfaces every couple of months, so beg pardon if you've already
seen this, but I've found that the best, most painless, and in the long run
cheapest way to fix the problem is to take the offending piece to a place
that does electrical discharge milling (EDM) tap and stud removal. It's
fairly cheap and leaves the threads in your head undamaged. And there is no
risk of causing further damage with various drills, taps, etc. You can find
them in the phone book under "TAPS - EXTRACTING." Or ask a machine shop,
they should know. My Los Angeles phone book shows 5 companies doing this. I
use another shop in Orange County (4 shops in OC).

Subject: Oil Pressure on a 87 944S

Hello.  Recently there has been talk about warming up our Pcars when 
cold.  One individual mentioned that he waited till pressure was 120psi.  
Among my VW friends, the consensus is not rev more than 3K rpm when the oil 
temperature is less than 80C.  Well, my '87 944S does not have a oil temp 
gauge, neither does the oil pressure give meaningful numbers,  it is just 
a gauge that goes from 1 to 5.  
Is there a way to translate the meaningless oil pressure numbers to 
something like psi?  And/or is it possible to add an oil temp gauge to 
the 944?  I have seen the gauges on the Automotion catalague but it does 
not seems like the sender unit on the 944 was meant to do temp gauges.  
Comments?
Thank you very much for your time.

If I'm not mistaken, your oil pressure guage reads in bar.  Just multiply by

Subject: "lowered" 86 Carrera questions...

Hello everyone,
 I am looking at purchasing a 82-86 model year Carrera, and talked with an
owner that has one ('86) with 116k miles. Compared to other seller/owners I 
have talked with on the phone, it seems like he has taken care of it. He is the
second owner, and the original owner had it lowered shortly after getting it. 
That raises some questions that I could use a little help on:
1. Does this present a suspension problem that I should consider before
   purchasing it, i.e. are front end suspension components going to wear out
   sooner?
2. What parts are affected/swapped out, if any, when a 911 is lowered for
   cosmetic purposes? (FYI he told me its lowered about 4 inches)
3. Would it be worthwhile to have it raised to normal specs? 
4. As usual, what is your opinion on a fair price (he's asking $21k). 
6. Is 116k miles considered a "middle aged" Porsche (someone noted yesterday
   that 61k miles was considered "adolescence" :) ) Is this too old for a first
   time Porsche owner to get into even if the engine was well taken care of?

The clutch was replaced 10k miles ago, and he has all the maintenance records 
(he knew the original owner). I feel that this is a fair price, based on the 
number of miles it has on it. I have already read about the recommended engine
checks to have done if I get serious about this one (compression, leak down,
etc.), but am not knowledgable about suspension mods. If you want to save net 
bandwidth, my address is included below...

                                        thanks in advance,

I'm no expert, but I have something relative to this discussion:

What about the practice of using a left-hand drill bit (I think Snap-On sells
them).  I have heard that in some cases, the left hand rotation of the bit
will actually spin the offending stud
out.  

Any positive experiences?  If there is such a thing...

Subject: RE: Oil Pressure on a 87 944S


Menelaos,

As others have mentioned, the pressure gauge measures in bar (or
atmospheres), and all you do is put your lips together and multiply.
In a 944, you will have full oil pressure as soon as the car starts, like
five bar, so that is not an issue.

As far as temperature goes, I can tell you my experience.  I have
installed an oil temp gauge in my '87 944S.  I have found that it takes
roughly twice as long for oil temp to reach operating point (180F) as
it does for the coolant temp to do the same.  So, if it takes five minutes
of driving to get the coolant to the lower mark on the gauge, count on
ten minutes for oil temp to come up.  This is approximate, and was
what I observed during a year of four-seasons driving when my car
still had the aspiro's oil/water heat exchanger.

Adding an oil temp sender is not very difficult.  Jim Selders pointed
out to me a great location for it.  On the normally aspirated cars, there
is a blind plug in the oil filter base (actually, the oil/water heat
exhanger) manifold, around the corner from the oil pressure sender.
It is an M18 x 1.5 thread.  You can get an oil temp sender in this size
from VDO or their distributors.  I got mine from North Hollywood
Spedometer, along with a gauge and wiring kit.  (VDO in fact makes
the senders in M10 through M26 sizes, all are 1.5 mm pitch except
for the M10 which is 1.0 mm pitch.

On the turbocharged cars, the manifold doesn't have this bore.  Well,
it does, but it has been ground down, is not tapped, and had a freeze
plug in it.  The shop installed a temp sender on a friend's 951S by
locating it in the head of the hollow union bolt which connects the
turbo oil return line to the pan.  Apparently there is enough material
there that it works OK.

Sounds like a good idea.  Probably have to pull the wheel well liner to

This is a MB question, but I think it also applies to Porsches and other
German iron. I think all CC units are made by VDO. It sounds as if one of the
components in the control unit is going. Unfortunately, they are not
user serviceable. Your best bet would be to check Panorama or MB's The Star
for names of fixerupper places. I seen ads for used and reconditoned CC units.

On the 911 series, the CC unit is behind the cardboard panel in the trunk, by 
the heater blower. In the 300 Series MB they are under the steering column.

MB offers their factory manuals to the public at a much lower price than 
Porsche. You can contact MB of NA here in NJ. They are located in Montvale.
They'll be happy to send you their catalog. I think I paid like $60 for a 
chassis ,electrical and body manuals. 3 volumes, I'll say about 400 pages
all together.

Subject: 911 Starter (Continued), P Dealer bitch session

Dear Porsche Friends:
	Here's an update on my problems with the 911 starter. After replacing
the selenoind with a new unit, I still had no power going to the starter. All
electrical systems and fuel pump were go, but nothing was turning.

I was seeing voltage with the yellow wire (from ignition switch) disconnected, 
but could not see any voltage when connected to the starter. I figured it was 
the switch. Put 12V to terminal 50 directly from the battery and the selenoid
clicked. I then went to the schematic.

As it turns out, there are a couple of more wires comming from the POS post at
the battery. The real big one, goes directly to the starter. In addition, there
is a wire that powers the fuse box and another that goes to the switch. As it
turn out, the terminal at the battery that held these auxiliary power cables
was loose. 

I believe, they got loose when I removed the battery to clean the tray. After
making sure that the aux term at the battery post was tight, the car has startedfine for the past few days. I'm actually using the old selenoid.

An additional note on starting. Now that the temps in Jersey are about 50F
daily, I noticed that the car starts and goes into fast idle mode without
hunting as it did when it was warmer. It seems that the DME CPU feels better
about starting when it is a little colder. Perhaps some voltage threshold??
Any one ou there noticed this?

And now a word about my local P dealer who never seems to have anything in stoc
I've been doing some major work on my 944. Running gear related stuff to get it
ready for the track. FE bearings, RE bearings, repacking CV joints, oil leaks,
you get the idea.

While doing a CV joint, I noticed that there was a slight tear on it. Since I 
had everything apart, I decided to replace it (false economy not to do it).
So I went to my local P dealer. Well, they did not have the part! Bummer.
You figure that by one of those chances, they might have to replace one of
these when they service car. I would hate to be a customer of theirs and have towait a few days to get it. I do not expect them to have everything in there,
but a CV boot should be a normal item.

I ordered the part from Zim's. Meanwhile, since I can't use the car, I moved
up my calipers/MC rebuild. 

What are your experiences with your local P dealers?

Thanks for your ears. I needed to bitch about it...

Subject: New 914 Engine Plan and Questions

P-philes,

Many thanks to the numerous and thorough replies to my question about rebuilding
the 914 engine.  I am practically in shock over all the info I got.  Of course I
was also suitably humbled -- I guess I don't know as much as I thought....

Well, enough self degradation and kissing up... on to the matter at hand!
All posts pretty much suggested getting a 2.0 litre core and working from that 
so that is what I did.  I was very lucky (I hope?) and found a 1975 915 2.0 
project car for sale.  I say project car because it was it in the left rear door
and quarter panel pretty hard and the Previous Owner began dismanteling and 
replacing stuff.  Anywho, I got it cheap and the engine was (supposedly) just 
rebuilt within 10K miles and it has the entire D-Jet FI setup.  It was even 
driven home to it's current garaged location.

The new plan is to drop my 1.8 tranny and engine and replace it with the 2.0 
tranny and engine (the tranny was also rebuilt).  I'm not sure if I will rebuild
or wait until I know I should.
My big question is: Should I transfer all my L-Jet stuff over to it or can I 
just leave the D-Jet stuff on and use that system?  It seems that everyone is 
leaning toward the D-Jet, but it seems to me that L-Jet is a better system as 
long as your air flow box is OK.  Any suggestions?

Also:  Since the car is a 1975, it's got a smog pump.  I plan on removing it 
because my '74 doesn't need one.  Anyone done this before?  Is there an approved
method?  The catalogs list alot of different part numbers for 1975 -- did I 
screw up by getting one?  In particular, someone mentioned the case was more 
prone to warpage -- why?  Why are the 1975 injectors, brain, sensors, etc 
different from the earlier ones?

pentultimate Question:  2.0l injectors differ from 1.8 ones because for a fixed 
length electrical pulse the 2.0 squirts out more gas?  If so, why is it 
suggested to swap to 2.0l injectors if L-jet is used on a 2.0.  Wouldn't that 
just make the car run richer?

And finally:  The books and catalogs list the fuel pressure regulator (metal can
with 2 fuel and 1 air line) but I can't figure out what the metal can on my car 
is that has 3 air lines.  One goes to fuel pressure regulator and the others go 
to the air distribution box.  I assume it also helps regulate fuel pressure by 
regulating the air that goes to the fuel pressure sensor, but can someone tell 
me what it is called and how it works?

Tank you all very much!
Tim
Now proud owner of 4 914's, none of which run!

I've heard of this working sometimes, fortunately I've never broken a stud
before (knock on wood...)

Just thought I'd mention one thing about drill bits - they are *NOT* created
equal!  Most of you are probably aware of this, but just in case:

If you shop at Sears and if you ever find yourself needing to drill holes in 

metal, use Sears EXCALIBUR drill bits - not their regular "high-speed
steel" bits.  The EXCALIBUR bits don't "wander".  They grab and "bite"
into the metal (even on curves) and allow you to drill a hole where you
want without the usual requirement of a centerpunch.  Of course, if the
application requires absolute perfection, use a centerpunch just to be
sure.

I'll never buy a regular "high-speed-steel" drill bit again!!!

Leave the 2.0 D-Jet stuff on the engine.

The answer to the last question and the first are related -- it's all due to
emissions crap. If you're in a smog controlled area, you need to keep all
that stuff intact or you'll have hard time passing smog (latest of the engine
or the body is the metric, and all the stuff has to be intact and working).
This means the cat and the exhaust too. If you're *NOT* in a smog controlled
area, and don't think you'll ever want to take the car to live in a smog
controlled area, you can do a lot. You *COULD* plumb the engine to a '74 2.0
spec and just refuse to acknowledge that it's a '75 engine, but that GC
serial number should be a giveaway to anyone saavy about such things...

There are two conditions that you also have to deal with: one, the terminal
flow rate -- at full cycle, how much gas does the injector flow and two, at
what cycling rate does the EFI approximate CIS. In general, that's a fairly
low RPM -- 4k or so, so anything above that is running "open loop" and hence
needs the bigger injector.

The D-Jet has a static fuel pressure and uses a different sensor to detect
changes in the manifold pressure. The L-Jet uses a rising rate regulator
that sends more pressure under load than in a steady state. The three air line
gizmo is a "flashback valve" -- more or less like a PCV valve on a US
engine. It connects to the heads and the air intake to reduce pressure
inside the valve cover area and thereby reduce blow-by and improve valve
operation efficiency.

I just ordered from them for the first time last week. Bought a used
heater blower motor from them for $100. Not an exceptional price, but better
than the $170-$200 new price. And, no one else (Aase,PartsHeaven,EASY,etc)
had the unit.

The fellow that I dealt with on the phone was fairly abrupt and could
probably benefit from a "phone manners" class. But, the part did arrive
via UPS in just a few days, it was the correct part and in good shape. 
I DO think their pricing/shipping is somewhat arbitrary- they quoted me $100.
When I asked how much with shipping they said $102. When was the last time
UPS shipped 5 lbs cross country for $2?

  Stan, Tommy, and DR914;  Thanks for the response.
  -will probably do the 'ignitor' thing (already have on my Weber/009

.
  DR914 had much to say about static timing, who was that masked man?
 ::
  It came across yesterday (11/10/94) that Hyundai has purchased our 
division.  Hmm, I had a honda moped once that sounded like that when I put 
the strait pipe on it...huunndai, huunndai!
  So there may be an email address change in our future.

  I overheard from our LAN folk that AT&T wants to keep our 'Class B subnet 
address' and issue us in its place a Class C address.  Something about 
limiting us to 255 addresses might cramp our style.  I think i understand 
this to be a potential impact for net traffic at this site.  I hope they 
figure something out...I dunno if I can survive without pphiles to consume 
my spare moments...!

  I just cant help myself;
   My educated feelings toward AT&T are that they intended from the start to 
purchase NCR and slice them up like a Christmas turkey and sell off the bits 
at profit.  Perhaps the CEO should have established a higher price to force 
ATT to hang onto the investment.

   I find it very curious that our associates at other NCR divisions had ID 
badges with the AT&T logo, (we call it the DEATHSTAR)  and we here are still 
using ID's with the NCR logo, three years later.  This is a major clue as to 
AT&T's true intentions.  They must have from the start intended to dump us 
as soon as it would not adversely affect their PR, (and revenues?)

  That's just business, but geez, we met our financial goals for the *year* 
 last JUNE.  Our profitability is rising at an extraordinary rate; We are in 
the black as we nearly always have been.
  So why ditch a successful business?

  Some of the NCR divisions AT&T is keeping have a long track record of 
being in the RED as often as WE have been in the BLACK over the last decade 
or so.  We wont miss them or their influence.

  This puzzles me;  Why would AT&T balk at re-investing in the wafer fab 
facility, but embrace portions of the old NCR that are revenue flat?  I'm 
wondering if the kids running the store know what they are doing.

  I'll shut up now.

I have a high mileage 1977 911S. As it is a daily car in the Pacific

engine job. Having talked to as many people as I can, it seems that I 
have 4 options: (1) rebuild my engine, (2) buy another rebuilt 2.7 
engine, (3) buy and drop in a 3.0L SC engine, (4) buy and drop in a 3.2L

special concerns about the 3.2 swap, inlcuding keeping the tach from the 
3.2 and not my original. One final point, I drive the car every day, 
rain, shine or snow and so it is a street car and it must pass our Air Care 
system so I would keep the CIS etc and not put on carbs. I would 
appreciate advice, comments, expereinces etc. Thanks in advance. And if 
you have a good quality 3.0 or 3.2 (complete with DME etc) then let me know.

Subject: Re: Which synthetic oil?

Dear Neil:

          I like and have been using Castrol Syntec (5W-50 wt) in all my cars
and The Truck for the past 18 months. So far, all the changes have been good.
 Trusty Rusty, my '63 356B starts much easier in the winter, runs cooler and
always has 60PSI Oil Pressure.  I change it every 3,000 miles in the 356. My
1980 528i BMW with 190,000 miles has been using Castrol for 20,000 miles with
5-6000 mile changes (oil and filter). It also starts easier and seems to run
better than withPennzoil 20w-50. The '69 Chevy 1/2 ton Pick up truck
likewise. I switched over to Castrol Syntex after noting the beginnings of
dingleberries on the valve springs on the BMW and The Truck after a mere
160,000 miles with Pennzoil 20W-50 and 3,000 miles oil & filter changes.
      I have also tried 15W-50 Mobil 1 which seemed to work about as well as
Castrol Syntec, though my personal preference is the Syntec as  the 5 wt
makes for easy starting at Tahoe.

Just my $.02
The Maestro

P.S. If you decide to switch, I'd drop the screen, replace the filter, add
the Synthetic, and change it  at 1000 miles. Repeat the process at 2000
miles. On a 356 with a non-full flow filter, I think about 4,000 miles is a
reasonable oil change interval. I have a customer who has run Mobil 1 for
80,000+ miles (after breaking the engine on "regular" oil for 3-4000 miles),
and his Rocker area is SPOTLESS!
P.P.S. See the current "356 Registry" for a much more detailed discussion of
Synthetic Oil vs. regular oil.

Anyone noticed how much faster SP has become this year?

I wonder how many seconds are due to:

	1) Track surface 
	2) Sticky Tires 
	3) More rad cars @ PCA events

I remember being AMAZED when Brunholder put his 911 track car into the
1:25s for FTD at a time trials (88?).  It was a VERY light early car on
slicks.

Now we have stock-engined SCs (Greg Wilson) turning :27s flat and 944 turbos
(Modified - granted) turning :21s!  

I won't divulge my times -. but I do know they are 4 sec faster than
anything I ever ran in my 951 -w- chips and TS suspension three years
ago.  And that in a nearly stock SC ;)

Anyone care to comment?

Mike and Peter,
   The instructions for cleaning and washing that came with my Wolf technalon
cover say to wash in large automatic washer found in many laundrettes.  Use
Ivory soap (not detergent) only and use only half as much as you would use in
a regular wash. Run it through two rinse cycles as it is most important that
all the 
soap be removed so as to preserve the cover's water repellency. Air dry the 
cover - Do Not put it in automatic dryer.
   The other way is to put it on your car inside out and hose it off and let
it dry on the car before storage.  I think this would be your best bet.

Lou,
        My experience with dealers, other than Porsche, has been that they
DO have the parts, to use on their customers cars.  For the reason you
mention they would rather not keep a customer waiting who has brought their
car in for service, but someone walks in off the street and they order
the part.  The exception to this has been my Mitsubishi dealer.  So
far I have never had to wait for any parts.  Nothing big yet, luckily.
        But other dealers, have not been that great to deal with.  Nissan,
Pontiac, Chevy, Toyota, nearly always have to order the part.  One
reason the dealer is usually the last place I will go for generic parts.
        I feel for ya,
Tom

p.s.  These dealers are all located in what I would consider a small
town, Santa Rosa, 70 miles north of San Francisco.  This may have
something to do with my experiences.

    The "flashback valve" isn't really a "can", though.  (Do I have the wrong

It lives (on my 74 2.0) on the LHS of the engine, up on top.  The Decel

It's called Thunder Hill Motorsports Park near Willows (west on Highway

year ago as the inaugural event. I'm not sure of the length, but I'd say
about 1 1/2 miles in its current stage of development. The original plan has
a second loop joining the current track which would more than double its
total length. I don't know what schedule SFR has for the second loop.

You need to talk with Golden Gate Region time trialers for impressions of
the track. Mike Lommatzsch (mpl@netcom.com) might be able to fill you in on
the track and maybe the rent possibilities. I've driven around at touring

Most likely culprit is the slave cylinder.  Slave cylinder not too difficult
to replace.  Pull the starter, disconnect the hose for the slave, cap it
with the rubber valve cover, remove the slave.

Rebuild kits are available for around $30.

Clutch master cylinder is a bitch, you need several u-joint sockets and
double jointed parents.

I didn't mean investment as in T-Bill or even Bugatti Royale. But I do 
believe that the value of a 930 will increase in price as the years go by. 
It is currently accessible because it is recent vintage, (still!) produced 
in reasonable quantities, (still!) supported by the factory, and most of 
them are still on the road. One can use it as a daily driver. These things 
will hold down its value. However, it is still the ultimate 911 (yes, yes 
Carrera RS, 959, 3.8 RSR-but these are not routinely purchased by the 
public) Most of the 930's out there have been hacked, crashed or modified, 
detracting from their value. If you should find one from the 1st year that 
it was imported, with no modifications, then I think that you will have a 
car that will become harder to find as the years go by. Of course, no one 
but me has seen that yet:) One day, when to good times come back to Wall 
Street and MBA's first year salaries exceed their parent's net worth, when 
Porsche no longer produces anything other than a built only from recycled 
90's junkmobiles hydrogen-powered liquid-cooled mini-van and the autobahn 
has a speed limit and HOV lanes, and yes, when I have Vaslek Polak's garage 
and want to show my high-school age grandchild what car I wanted, but had 
no hope of driving when I was his/her age, then the 930 will be a 
collector's item. Anyway, I think that I just talked myself into violating 
my "no car can cost more than 1 paycheck" rule. 

Definitely just my $.02

Often time the cause of this used to be (in 924's) the air conditioning

I must say, the simple economics of supply and demand would indicate it
will be decades before 930s become collectable and increase in price
greater than inflation... or the increase in road taxes, property
taxes, parts and shop labor. Many less early (pre-1974) 911Ses were
built (and lots of these rusted away, crashed or hacked upon) and these
cars command about half of what an XKE roadster goes for on the open
market.

 If only 5000 examples had been built, than you would be four times
 more likely to realize significant appreciation of your asset.
 Alternately, collecting Porsches could become four times more popular
 and then the increased demand for 930s would increase the market
 price.

 930s are great cars and can bring much pleasure to their owners.
 However, your children or grandchildren may find your 930 to
 significantly increase in value... I don't think you will beat
 inflation.
 

Another humble $0.02 worth!

Subject: Oil leak, 85 early 944

Help,

	What used to be a slow trickle of oil appears to be turning into a 
geyser.  After much scraping, wiping, and searching, the oil appears to be 
coming from the front right side of the engine; somewhere around the lower 
balance shaft housing.  There is a piece of metal, apparently some kind of a
bracket, that appears to be screwed into (or through) the right side of the
balance shaft housing with 4 (13mm) bolts.  I looked in Haynes to find out what 
this was but found no mention of it.  There was nothing in EUROSELECT either.
This piece is directly below the oil cooler relief plug and directly above the
oil pan gasket.  The oil either runs down the inside back side of this bracket
thing or is seeping from around the inside surface where it is bolted into 
(through) the balance shaft housing.  Also, I looked on top of this piece but
found no pools of oil around the oil cooler, relief plug, etc.

What is this thing?  Where is the most likely source of oil near it?

Of course you can use my articles! Please make sure, however, you give me the
byline!

Larry, the clutchtube replacement procedure is another article I wrote.  It's
complete with a diagram and allows this unique 914 problem to be easily
solved.

To complete the procedure, you may want to add:
Tools required:
Allen socket (5mm)
Screwdriver (regular, medium blade)
Punch (small blunthead)
deep well socket (11mm)
rachet wrench (3/8 drive)
vise grips (small)
combination wrench (10mm)
jack
2 jackstands
socket (17mm)
plastic hammer
vacuum cleaner!

Supplies and parts required:
grease
silicone spray
WD-40 lubricant
brake clean
rags
clutch cable
clevis bushing
clevis fork
clevis bushing
banjo clip
clutch cable boot
nyloc
steel clutch cable wedge

We at Automobile Atlanta have decided to lend some of our knowledge to all
of you because we live and breathe 914s and want to encourage the world to
fix them up and enjoy them! Here's the answer to a question we received
recently on how to install a clutch cable on a 914 Porsche:

Proper clutch cable installation is as follows:
1. Jack the 914 on the engine mounting bar high enough so you can roll under
it and work. Support it with two jack stands under the jacking donuts.
2. Remove the driver's floor carpet, pedal pads, center carpeting, front
black access plate and wooden floor board.
3. Remove the rear 11mm clutch adjusting nut at the fork, the clutch cable
wedge in the fork and the nut on the roller assembly.
4. Free the banjo clip from the roller assembly and remove the cable and
roller from the housing. Slide the old clutch cable boot off (if it is still
there!) and save.
5. Unclip the clevis pin from the front clutch cable fork and remove. Pull
the cable forward and unscrew the clutch cable fork and locking nut from the
clutch cable end. Push out the clevis bushing from the pedal cluster.
6. Remove the cable from the back firewall. Carefully inspect the back
firewall at this time. Make sure the tube is protruding and there is no
 evidence of firewall cracking evident. If there is, or the tube is not
protruding (you just see a hole), proceed to review the "Clutch Tube Repair
Procedure".c 1991 by George Hussy
7. Using WD-40 with a spray wand attachment, spray down the tube. This
lubricates the inside of the tube, helps eliminate rust and coats the inside
of the tube for easier cable installation.
8. Select the proper clutch cable:  There are three to choose from. (1) The
original 914-4 which has the exposed cable, surrounded with a white catheter
and protruding from the black sheath. (2) The 914-6 cable which is heavier
than the "four" cable and does not have the white catheter. (3) The
aftermarket "Terry" cable which uses aircraft quality cabling. We always
select the 914-6 cable. It is heavier duty than its four brother and is of
the proper length (we always find the Terry cables to have too much cable and
to be very expensive!)
9. Lubricate the chosen cable with grease (lightly but thoroughly; you don't
want it attracting too much dirt) and install into the rear firewall tube
pushing it all the way forward until the gold collar engages with the
protruding  tube.
10. Reach through the front access cover and center tunnel and feel for the
front end of the cable. Install the locking nut and clutch cable fork (make
sure the fork is not cracked!) Screw the fork on until the cable threads
protrude 10mm into the fork base. Lock the nut against the fork.
11. Replace and grease the clevis bushing in the pedal cluster (The old one
was probably egg-shaped). Carefully inspect the clevis pin, then connect the
cable fork to the cluster and pin it. Be very careful not to wrap the cable
around the accelerator cable! If you do, everytime you disengage the clutch,
the engine will rev! (It now may be a good time to vacuum this area!)
12. Reinstall the wooden floor board, access plate center tunnel carpeting
and pedal pads. Leave out the driver's carpeting for clutch pedal stop
adjustment.
13. At the back of the cable, install the banjo clip and stretch the clutch
cable boot over the threaded cable end.
14. Thoroughly clean the roller and roller assembly. Lightly grease the
roller pivot.
15. Install the clutch cable into the roller housing notch and bend the banjo
clip around the assembly until the point of the banjo clip fits into the hole
in the back of the roller assembly. Snug up the clutch cable boot.
16. Wrap the cable around the roller and install onto the roller pivot.
Tighten the nut and then guide the cable into the fork, securing it with the
clutch cable wedge and 11mm nyloc. Make sure the wedge is the new factory
steel style. 914s were originally fitted with a plastic wedge that often
broke, stranding the motorist!
17. Tight the 11mm nyloc nut until the clutch pedal is at the very top of its
travel. One should not be able to pull the pedal up any farther. The pedal
will have tension on it but for the first 1/2" - 3/4" have much less tension.
This lesser tension is called free play as the pedal is taking up cable
assembly slack before actually causing the clutch arm to engage the throwout
bearing. This free play keeps the throwout bearing from wearing against the
pressure plate fingers.
NOTE:  If for some reason you run out of adjustment and have to stack washers
under the threaded end to achieve adjustment, the clutch tube is broken in
the tunnel. Again, refer to the "Clutch Tube Repair Procedure".c 1991 by
George Hussy
18. Adjust the clutch cable stop:  Thoroughly warm the car and idle at 950
RPM. Push the clutch pedal forward until first and reverse gear will engage
smoothly without grinding against the pedal. Tighten the stop to the point
where it rests against the depressed pedal. Reinstall the driver's carpeting.
19. By now you should have a very easy pushing clutch pedal and good
disengagement of gears. Shortly you may need to readjust the cable after it
stretches out its newness. From then on periodically recheck free play and
adjust. This should not be a common occurance unless the cable begins to
strand (break) or the clutch tube is ripping loose.

Subject: Re: 914/6 - 915 Shift Linkage


Dear Al:

You are going to have quite a 914 when you are through. However, before
purchasing an expensive 915 gearbox and proceeding with an even more
expensive 916 conversion, consider installing a 73-76 914 gearbox. In
addition to the great money savings and ease of installation, this transaxle
will easily handle up to 250 ft. pounds of torque, shift much better than any
915 setup and bolts to the 3.0 engine via the Beck Engineering flywheel
(909-981-3840).

Al, having done many of these conversions in the past and knowing how costly
they are, we know you must be a big spender, so what's another $2,500
(especially if it's spent on a 914)!

It is our choice to use only the George Vellious 915 to 916 conversion kit,
with the 914 World Headquarters shift linkage kit. These two kits have been
carefully engineered to provide the easiest installation and most precise
shifting available. We all know, however, that the bulky shifting 915 gearbox
only gets bulkier when the linkage is extended. With no fabrication required,
the complete 916 transaxle and shift linkage conversion kit retains the
factory look while allowing one to install a factory interior and even center
console, if desired.

The cable shifter is for budget-minded racers. Although it works, fabrication
for mounting and clearance as well as interior modification becomes
necessary. An interesting tech letter from several years ago is added here:

Dear George:

I plan to install a 915 series gearbox on my '72 914-6 (not original). The
prime problem I have is the price of the shifter conversion kit. At $1,500
for 5 pieces - parts only - in addition to the $1,000 for a used gearbox.
Does anyone offer a kit at a more reasonable price? Any hints for
installation?
 - Mark Heron, California

Dear Mark,

What's $1,500 among friends? If you are thinking about such an extesive
update, the $1,500 is just a start - let me explain.

The 916 gearbox was originally installed in the 2.2 - 2.7 eleven or some 916
prototypes as a way to cope with the ever increaing horsepower of the 911
engine. It was made from a 915 type 911 gear box with modified shift rods,
tail cover, reversed ring gear and special 916 shift linkage. The benefits of
this special gear box have always been obscure to me except to guess the
following:

1. Porsche only had to produce one gear box for the 911 and 914-6, thus
saving money.
2. The gear box could handle any amount of power (who knows what the factory
had in mind for eventual 914-6 power?)
3. The gear box restored the original hot rod "H" shift pattern.

The detriments were as follows:

1. The gear box had a slow bulky shift.
2. It added 50 pounds of weight to the back end of the used-to-be fairly
well-balanced 914.

As you can see, installing a 916 gearbox isn't the brightest thing to do (of
course we installed one in my 3.0 914-6). Since so few opt for the 916 gear
box, the conversion parts are not mass produced and hence expensive. My
friend George Vellios makes the pieces on a limited basis and they truly are
nice parts; however, consider the following:

1. To attach the 5 conversion parts you must dismantle the 915 gear box,
reverse the ring gear & pinion resetting its depth and enlarge and tap the
console studs to fit and work.
2. The opposite side of the case (the side cover) needs to be tapped for
electronic speedo pick-up as there is no provision for mechanical drive, and
if using a 73-75 915 gear box the ring gear needs to be machined for
speedometer pickup.
3. The gear box when installed has to be spaced 1/2 inch in the rear to clear
the rear trunk floor.
4. The clutch cable roller assembly has to have three reinforcements welded
to it and mounted horizontally on the bottom of the gear box.
5. With this 916 set-up, the 911 clutch pushes too hard so installation of
the later 911 style pedal cluster with helper spring is a necessity.
6. Shift linkage, which used to be a nightmare to fabricate, is now easy with
the 914 World Headquarters shift linkage kit. We fabricate as follows:
  A. 915 shifter with factory short shift installed - the after market short
shifter is poorly machined and has too much slop.
  B. '70-'72 914 front shift bar
  C. Adjusting coupler make from front 70-72 coupler and a piece of the rear
'73-'76 front shift bar
  D. Rear '79 924 shift bar and coupling welded to the rear portion of
'73-'76 rear shift bar.

Even with this arrangement, the shifter is still 915-like, bulky and it is
harder than its 901 counterpart to downshift quickly. Here is the actual cost
of the gear box.

Good used 915 box        1,000 *This is a bargain

Vellios kit              1,500

Ringgear & pinion swap  
install speedo pickup
assembly kit & fit       800

914 World Headquarters
shift linkage kit        750

Clutch roller assembly   125

Pedal cluster w/helper   125

Used electric speedometer
and hook ups             150

Case machining           75

                         4,325 and that's cheap!

O.K., Mark. Do you still want to install a 916 gear box?

Subject: Re: need advice on 914 engine


Dear Will:

Congratulations on your purchase! $1,000 was a steal as any whole 914 these
days is worth $1,500 for junk!

Polyurethane is the best paint these days for your 914 and it is available in
factory colors (I believe you must have L-80E, light ivory).

Your engine should not need rebuilding at 130,000 miles unless it has been
abused. I suggest you do a leak down check and oil pressure check. This will
tell you the relative condition of your engine. Since engine rebuilding is so
expensive these days, we spend our money on making the body and interior
perfect first and then use leftover funds to freshen the powerplant. (Of
course if either the engine or transmission are "shot", you will have to
spend the money there first!) A quote from Dr. 914 "Powerplants are a dime a
dozen, but if you don't have a good body, you don't have a 914". 

Will, several days ago, I gave my recommendations on 914 engines and what is
best to do. I will repeat them here:

1. Since 914's are becoming rarer and more valuable by day and restorers are
investing thousands in them, it is best to do as the factory would have done
but take extra time. With that considered, we recommend the following:
   A. It costs almost as much to rebuild a 1.7, 1.8 as it does a 2.0 engine,
and a 914 with an injected 2.0 engine is much more powerful than a 1.7, 1.8
as well as $1500 more valuable. One would have to spend many extra dollars to
make a 1.7, 1.8 as powerful as a stock 2.0 engine. Hence, starting with an
injected 2.0 engine puts one miles ahead. These engines are cheaper than you
may think as we have seen them sell at swap meets and the Porsche Panorama
magazine for as little as $400.00. Local junkyards who don't know what they
have usually "give away" these engines. Unfortunately used 1.7, 1.8 engines
are virtually worthless so don't anticipate being able to sell or trade
yours.
   B. When rebuilding the 2.0 engine, we are careful to follow the factory
manual to the letter. It is self explanatory so we need not cover general
rebuilding. However we will cover the specific things the factory does not.
     1. The engine case:  Has a tendency to warp especially in the middle.
Have a competent shop check it and possibly align bore it. This will require
special bearings.
       a. 75-76 cases are especially prone to warpage beyond saving -
especially in the cam shaft bore. These engine cases, if not carefully
checked, cause a very hot running rebuilt engine!
       b. We take the time to eliminate all casting slag from inside the case
and make it as smooth as a baby's butt. We do not know how well this works,
but it has to reduce oil turbulence somewhat and let the crankshaft spin
easier!
       c. Oil Galley plugs:  By now many are loose. We repair/replace them
with a plumbing tap for a permanent repair. Why rebuild your engine, increase
the oil pressure only to blowout old galley plugs and all of the new oil!
    2. The crankshaft. Always inspect for cracks and polish and/or cut, but
not beyond .25mm! 2.0 crank counter balancing is difficult to do for
clearance reasons and is unnecessary below racing RPMs! We do, however,
carefully balance the front fan, crank, pistons, rods, flywheel and pressure
plate, all as one working unit.
    3. The connecting rods:  check for straightness and rebush.
    4. Camshaft: Always the factory one with a matched timing gear. This is
also the only one that works the best with the fuel injection.
    5. Lifters:  Always the solid factory type as hydraulic ones, although
quieter, sacrifice top end power and turn a 914 sports car into an economy
car.
    6. Pistons and cylinders: Always Mahle or Kolbenschmidt with 8.0 to
compression. The NPR kit is no longer manufactured and the last 2.0 variety
were actually dished on the top!
    7. Cylinder heads:  Eight new values and guides, combustion chambers
carefully "cc'd" and cut only enough for cleanup (2.0 heads cut too far are
garbage-can varieties and new ones are outrageously priced!)
    8. Fuel injection:  new vacuum line kit, head temp sensor, trigger
points, throttle switch. All of the other components, if still operational,
we reuse. Additionally use a 0 280 100 037 pressure sensor and an inline 270
ohm resistor between the control unit harness and head temp sensor lead (this
combination provides more top end power while still passing an emmissions
check.

Dear Pat:

140 mm is the MAX backspacing. You may want to go 135 or even 130. As we all
know, no 914 is exactly like any other, so 140 mm may not fit under your car
without scrubbing (especially under cornering leads). Stock is 120 mm
backspacing, so if you install your stock wheel, you may find you have more
room than you thought.

hard to diagnose. Perhaps give me a call:  (404) 427-2844 and we can discuss

line to a failing fuel pump relay or loose fuse! It cannot, however, be the

ones. All one needs is working knowledge of the system, a few common hand

only promote only stock fuel injected or six cylinder conversions all in a

I had written about engine reassembly several days ago - the engine oil
galley plug replacement is as follows:

Parts and tools needed:

small drill bit and sheet metal screw

1 - 37/64 drill bit

grease

2 -  (1) 3/8 pipe tap

3 -  (1) 3/8 pipe tap with 1st 1/2 inch removed and the cutting edges tapered

case sealant

1    3/8 brass pipe threaded plug


Drill a small hole in the suspect oil galley relief plug. Screw a sheetmeal
screw into the plug and pull it out. Stuff tissue into the hole to catch the
filings. Drill the galley plughole with the 37/64 drill and then pull out the
tissue with the filings (in the front, remove the oil filler base to help
clean the debris from the case. Lubricate both taps (the one you cut is to
ensure you can thread the complete length of the hole (it is called a
bottoming tap).

Restuff the hole with tissue and tap the case hole. Using the bottom tap,
complete the threading of the hole. Finally, install the 3/8 inch brass
plumbing plugs with case sealer.

With this repair method completed, we have never again had the galley plugs
loosen. 

You can usually reuse all of the case bolts, but always replace the rod nuts!

Subject: Re: New 914 Engine Plan and Questions


Dear Tim:

Congratulations on finding a 2.0 powerplant for your 1.8! However, I hope the
914 you are dismantling is too far gone to be saved! We never want to
sacrifice a savable 914 as each one is "a piece of Porsche history never to
be repeated" (a quote from Dr. 914).

Without incurring great expense, frustration and labor hours, install the
powerplant "as is" and drive off. The ignition harness will plug into your
relay board (after removing the 1.8 air cleaner stand and installing the two
center relays, you can use the same fuel pump. Simply connect the fuel lines
and mount the pressure sensor, decel valve and control unit.

About the air pump, please all 914 enthusiasts note here: the Federal
Government and the states are cracking down on emmissions - both on exhaust
output and proper equipment. In the future, older cars will need to have the
original emmissions equipment intact, plus pass an exhaust output check. We
have had hundreds of calls from 914 owners looking for the '75-'76 air pump
equipment and fuel injection systems to reinstall so their state will allow
them to register and drive their 914s. If you have emmissions equipment on
your 914, even if it may not be working, keep it! These parts are now
unavailable new, and if you lose or need them in the future you will be out
of luck.

Tim, although your model year 914 was not manufactured with the air pump and
tubing, I would certainly keep it mounted, only disconnecting the belt from
the drive pulley. With one less pulley to drive, the engine will have more
power and if you are ever questioned in the future, simple reinstallation of
the belt is all you will need to pass the test.

'75-'76 2.0 engines had their fuel injection systems tuned to run leaner.
Simple substitution of the injectors, pressure sensor, and control unit from
the '73-'74 2.0 models with the addition of the factory in-line 270 ohm head
temperature sensor resistor will provide increased top end power.

Finally, your fuel pressure regulator question applies only to your 1.8
engine. Since the 1.8 fuel injection has less provision for fuel injector
shutoff upon throttle closing, extra provision is made via the fuel pressure
regulator. With the throttle suddenly closed, a high vacuum situation occurs.
This vacuum pulls on the fuel pressure regulator diaphram and instantly
reduces the fuel pressure to about 15-17 lbs. This drop prevents injection
which prohibits unburned gas from exiting the tailpipe and cuts down on the
tailpipe "pop, pop, pop" during deceleration as well as impolite emmissions!

Finally, we are happy you own four 914s! The more the merrier!

This is the bracket which mounts your power steering pump, and also contains
the lower balance shaft seal.  Sound like your lower balance shaft seal is
the culprit.  Don't forget to change the mylar washer behind the seal when
you do the fix.  While you're in there, you may want to change the upper
balance shaft seal and the oil pump / crankshaft seal at the same time. 
Easier to get them all at once than one at a time.

Of course, while you're in there, you may as well spend another $40 or so
and replace the belts.  Cheap insurance.

'they did not want to make the pistons, not even calculate how many at what

Phew!  Been thinking about your post and considering the situation where 
someone tries to car jack the baby at gun point. Is this a common experience? 
My personal alarm is a snub nosed S&W .38 airweight, hollow points,  in an 
ankle holster but i realize this is not always a viable alternative. Need to 
shoot before the thief gets in the car.  Hollow points do make a splatter.   
 
 I've used "passive " alarms, the one that goes off with car motion or door 
openings. Also put in a manual  battery shutoff switch(that doesn't shut off 
the alarm) haven't lost a car yet but I am very particular about where I leave 
them.  Realize that these systems don't work in a car jacking situation but 
have some thoughts and questions about what does. 
 
Tracking devices:  How do these interface with the fuzz?  If someone hijacks 
your car at gunpoint or knifepoint or whatever and you can track the car, do 
the police give chase or do they wait until the car stops and then go get it?  
Don't need the pcar involved in a high speed chase. 
 
Probably the best scenario is one where the car disables itself in 60 seconds 
or so.  That way, you can make some tracks, get help and hopefully collect the 
car.  Do these alarms do this also?  How are they triggered?  Do they track 
with gps and do they have their own power supply?  Any alarm experts out there? 
 
A friend with a 59 Corvette that had been stolen installed a passive alarm, 
battery shutoff, fuel shutoff and  tear gas cannister under the dash that had

Would appreciate input on anti-theft and alarm devices for a 911,  especially
tracking devices such as Lo jack and Auto trac.  (I live in L.A. and last
Porsche I owned was taken at gunpoint in 1987.  I decided that best
protection was to not own one, but the new 911 (933) has bewitched me and
eroded the left side of my brain).

Try "Troy Lee Designs". I think he has a shop in Ca. I don't have the 
number. He does helmets for a lot of SuperCross riders and some Indy car 
drivers (Michael Andretti, Paul Tracy).  I have seen the number in 
"Motorcyclist" magazine.  Also there is Chris Wood of Air Trix Designs in 
Santa Barbara Ca. (805) 962-8672. He did a helmet for one the riders in 
Motorcyclist magazine.

Subject: RE: Reformulated Gas


If you are referring to the gas being forced on us in the NJ/PA area, well 
it sucks.  My two '88 4 cylinder Chevy Corsica's which were running well on 
Mobil regular gas went from 25 MPG down to 21 MPG.  Does this gas put out 
25% less pollution?  I'm burning nearly 20% more gas, thus more pollution 
per mile.

Both cars also began pinging and rattling the valves on moderate hills with 
the regular grade, which worked just fine before the oxygenated gas hit the 
pumps.  Now I'm forced to pay for a mid-grade in both cars.  And off course 
all grades went up in price 5-10 cents.

Isn't 87 octane the same regardless of formula?  I think Mobil needs to 
re-calibrate their octane gauge.  Next tank I'm going to try Shell or Hess 
regular and see if their 87 octane works any better.

I have always run Premium in the 928 and notice very little change.  It's 
just a bit down on power.  The idle also seems to be affected, it's not 
smooth like it was.  Seems to surge ever so slightly when parked.  I have 
not checked the MPG in a while, but it's not too far off.

Subject: RE: Help!  Car needs to rest 45 minutes after every 10 miles


Just a note of thanks to all those who offered suggestions to my last 
problem.  The problem turned out to be what no one expected, the computer 
brain, a $1,600 part.  This was determined after the Fuel pump, pump relay, 
fuel filter and three fuel pressure regulators (which they insist were near 
death) were all replaced without resolving the problem.

The range of diagnoses, both mechanical and electrical made my head spin 
when it became apparent just how much can go wrong, and how hard it is to 
diagnose these complex computerized toys we drive!

Brian at Ray Catena Porsche in Edison, NJ (where the car was serviced) did 
make up for most of the incorrect diagnosis.  They sold me the computer 
brain at cost (there's ALLOT of profit in there!) and cutting out much of 
the labor to make up for the bad diagnosis earlier.  Total cost for all the 
new parts above was just under $2,100.  They also repaired a problem I had 
with my shifter linkage which involved a $40 part, but charged me no labor. 


Since the brain lists for $1,600+ and there would be some hours spent to 
diagnose and repair this problem no matter what, I must say I'm satisfied 
with the outcome.  From what I hear, fuel pumps typically go at about 
100,000 miles, which is where I'm at now.  Since replacement time was 
probably coming up shortly, I consider this a mixed blessing.

Can anyone tell me if there is there anything else that typically lets loose 
at the 100,000 mile mark on a 928?  Please no (even if you must lie).

I also enjoyed these articles on the 914, as I am one of many who started out
in a 914 ('73 1.7, $1200 in '80). But the picture of the 25th anniversary

In the fall of 1990 I took Bruce Anderson's tune-up, 911 engine

to be very  usefull and very interesting.  Being able to spend several 
days in a small group, talking Porsches with Bruce Anderson and Jerry Woods
was worth the price.  And if Jerry Woods did not say a word, just watching
him assemble a P-motor is an experience I am happy to have had.

Subject: 951 clutch


  The clutch pedal not returning by itself could just mean the
hydraulic system needs to be bled again.  This is tricky due to
the position of the slave.  I was able to 'reverse-bleed' mine
by pushing the slave in manually by way of the clutch housing
inspection hole.
  I would try to re-bleed the system before buying a new slave,
and see what happens.

You can get very nice 356 pistons from Shasta Design, or you can get
Arias and Venolia to build you *ANYTHING*. I think we're paying like $125 
each for some pretty high custom 93.5mm EP 914 pistons I came up with...
Turn time is about 4 weeks from the time you agree on the drawings.

Getting cylinders is another matter. You *SHOULD* be able to get
used cast iron cylinders and overbore them some. That's harder with
the SC/912s of course. I don't know who makes cylinders for air-cooled
motors, but I know who to ask... I guess I have a task for the weekend.

are stolen than any other country that western Europe. However,

Jay,

As George says, sounds like a bad slave or master cylinder.  The fact
that the pedal won't return suggests that air has invaded the system,
probably getting past a bad seal in the cylinder.

Look for leaking fluid as a sign of which cylinder has failed.  A
failed master will typically leak into the driver's footwell and is
identified by wet toes on the driver's foot.  A failed slave will
show leakage from underneath the car, perhaps onto the ground or
the clutch bell housing.

You can get very nice 356 pistons from Shasta Design, or you can get
Arias and Venolia to build you *ANYTHING*. I think we're paying like $125 
each for some pretty high custom 93.5mm EP 914 pistons I came up with...
Turn time is about 4 weeks from the time you agree on the drawings.

Getting cylinders is another matter. You *SHOULD* be able to get
used cast iron cylinders and overbore them some. That's harder with
the SC/912s of course. I don't know who makes cylinders for air-cooled
motors, but I know who to ask... I guess I have a task for the weekend.

Ted, I would say that outside of the USA this is a very uncommon
experience! The UK is a world leader in car crime (amongst other
benchmarks in European attainment we also lead the divorce stakes and the
lowest educational attainment stakes!) and far more cars
are stolen than any other country that western Europe. However,
the frequency of cars being stolen with the use of violence, particularly
the use of a deadly weapon, is about as high as that of people
being kicked to death by donkeys on the way to work. I find it
sad to hear things like this from the US, especially since my
Porsche mad SO will probably be spending a year or so over on
your side of the pond shortly.

Subject: Hot video




I just happened to be sitting at home this morning,
when the was a thump on the door. No it was not my
boss coming to establish whether I was really sick rather 
skiving from work, no It was Mr Postman delivering the
the video I ordered recently, called Porsche: The Racing
Legend. This is an 80 minute video newly produced by
Woodcote films. Instantly I thrust the vid in to the
vid machine and settled down not really expecting much.

Verdict: Ben Evans says get this vid, it is the business.
I won't issue spoilers, except that this is the hottest
porsche motorcar porn video that I have ever seen. Derek
Bell thrashes just about every sinlge racing Porsche of
note round the track, and narrates the history of Porsche
racing with loads of brilliant archive film and interviews
with drivers of note. The highlights for me are Bell driving
a wonderful 1500 cc 4 cam 356 speedster, the engine sounded
marvelous, it looked brilliant, and also Bell driving the
917 and overcome with emotion and enthusiasm at the reunion with
the beast, and finally Bell thrashing the 962, and finally
spinning it!

This vid is a must for any porschephile. I ordered mine from
the ad in the latest 911 and Porsche World. I can't remember how
much it was, about 20 quid I think, worth twice as much IMHO.
I will probably never get to drive a 917, 956, 962, 935, 936,
etc, etc, but this gives you a great impression of these
wonderous, ass-kicking, brutal and legendary beasts.

Subject: Re: 951 clutch

Jay,

As George says, sounds like a bad slave or master cylinder.  The fact
that the pedal won't return suggests that air has invaded the system,
probably getting past a bad seal in the cylinder.

Look for leaking fluid as a sign of which cylinder has failed.  A
failed master will typically leak into the driver's footwell and is
identified by wet toes on the driver's foot.  A failed slave will
show leakage from underneath the car, perhaps onto the ground or
the clutch bell housing.

Subject: Reformulated gas

 
Hi, Bill.
 
What you have experienced may be due not to a problem with octane rating but
rather with the energy content of the fuel. Adding loads of ethanol to the
fuel decreases the energy content; ethanol (or methanol) has less BTU per
gallon than gasoline. So you need to burn more gallons of it to do the same
job. This is great for the gas retailers too, as you have to buy more of the
stuff and it's already higher priced. You lose both ways. And you are a
one-man farm subsidy, supporting Archer-Daniels-Midland (the distiller, and
maker of Jack Daniels) and all the corn growers. Maybe we need to boycott
Jack Daniels? (I prefer the imported stuff anyway). Picket the still, get
big media coverage of irate motorists? Look at all the coverage the people
protesting outside the Federal Reserve got the other day.
 
Octane rating is not related to energy content. Alcohol has lower energy
content but actually has a very high octane rating, in fact it's an octane
booster. Indy cars can run surprisingly high compression ratios on methanol
because it is so insensitive to knock.
 
Also, ethanol carries some oxygen with it. Unless you have something to
compensate (such as modern fuel injection system with an exhaust gas oxygen
sensor) the car will run lean. This is the bureaucratic engineering method
of "automatically" trying to make every car out there run leaner, which the
bureaucratic mind equates with less pollution (more air oxidizes the HC and
CO better, but never mind that it makes more NOx).
 
If I remember correctly the Beretta/Corsica have port fuel injection and an
oxygen sensor, though. Maybe the sensor is shot? It should be tweaking the
fuel injection quantity to get enough fuel in there to avoid running lean.
(But that would in part explain your higher consumption -- more fuel
required to do the same job, more fuel required to run correct mixture).
 
You may wind up going to 89 octane.
 
Pete

Hi, Mike.
 
Yeah, celebration in Rust. My former next door neighbor in Weissach was
involved in organizing that, called up here to get name of contact at U.S.
914 club. Rust has a big amusement park (I can just see it now -- Six Flags
over Greater Unified Germany -- you gotcher U.S. flag, British flag, French
flag, Russian flag, German flag, und ze Cherman flag ve only bring out for
ze spezial occasions) and they did this gathering as a sort of
promotion to get people to come out to the park.
 
BTW, do you know what rust is? It was invented by Karmann (the people who
built the 914, the 912, and many 356s). Karmann thought it was such a
wonderful idea that they patented it and sold it to the Italians.

Hi, Trond.
 
Two things re pistons.
 
1) There is always somebody at swap meets selling new old stock NPR piston
and cylinder sets. If you REALLY want this stuff, I can buy a set. I've seen
prices of $100, 2 months ago. Several people had them, and as near as I
could tell, nobody was buying. They're not all that desirable, but they're
cheap. If so, tell me how much I'm allowed to spend.
 
2) If you want something better, I can get forged aluminum pistons for you,
cheap. Not as cheap as the NPRs, but not as expensive as the ones you see
advertised (and it's the same piston). It would probably be best if you have
somebody local bore out used iron barrels to take the pistons, but I can
have that done here too. You need to decide on a compression ratio.
 
Mahle and KS prices are fine if you are doing a cutaway engine for concours
<g>.
 
And does the Italian piston maker have a secretary that speaks Norwegian?

Dear Jerry:

Our man Sean is the high performance 914 engine specialist. He will be happy
to talk to you about your engine. Just call (404) 427-2844. I, Dr. 914, can
only promote only stock fuel injected or six cylinder conversions all in a
tasteful factory manner (I'm also very old and slow!).

I had written about engine reassembly several days ago - the engine oil
galley plug replacement is as follows:

Parts and tools needed:

small drill bit and sheet metal screw

1 - 37/64 drill bit

grease

2 -  (1) 3/8 pipe tap

3 -  (1) 3/8 pipe tap with 1st 1/2 inch removed and the cutting edges tapered

case sealant

1    3/8 brass pipe threaded plug


Drill a small hole in the suspect oil galley relief plug. Screw a sheetmeal
screw into the plug and pull it out. Stuff tissue into the hole to catch the
filings. Drill the galley plughole with the 37/64 drill and then pull out the
tissue with the filings (in the front, remove the oil filler base to help
clean the debris from the case. Lubricate both taps (the one you cut is to
ensure you can thread the complete length of the hole (it is called a
bottoming tap).

Restuff the hole with tissue and tap the case hole. Using the bottom tap,
complete the threading of the hole. Finally, install the 3/8 inch brass
plumbing plugs with case sealer.

With this repair method completed, we have never again had the galley plugs
loosen. 

You can usually reuse all of the case bolts, but always replace the rod nuts!


There is a very good source for parts and if you send me your name and
address, I'll send you something.

This is the bracket which mounts your power steering pump, and also contains
the lower balance shaft seal.  Sound like your lower balance shaft seal is
the culprit.  Don't forget to change the mylar washer behind the seal when
you do the fix.  While you're in there, you may want to change the upper
balance shaft seal and the oil pump / crankshaft seal at the same time. 
Easier to get them all at once than one at a time.

Of course, while you're in there, you may as well spend another $40 or so
and replace the belts.  Cheap insurance.

Subject: Reformulated gas

 
Hi, Bill.
 
What you have experienced may be due not to a problem with octane rating but
rather with the energy content of the fuel. Adding loads of ethanol to the
fuel decreases the energy content; ethanol (or methanol) has less BTU per
gallon than gasoline. So you need to burn more gallons of it to do the same
job. This is great for the gas retailers too, as you have to buy more of the
stuff and it's already higher priced. You lose both ways. And you are a
one-man farm subsidy, supporting Archer-Daniels-Midland (the distiller, and
maker of Jack Daniels) and all the corn growers. Maybe we need to boycott
Jack Daniels? (I prefer the imported stuff anyway). Picket the still, get
big media coverage of irate motorists? Look at all the coverage the people
protesting outside the Federal Reserve got the other day.
 
Octane rating is not related to energy content. Alcohol has lower energy
content but actually has a very high octane rating, in fact it's an octane
booster. Indy cars can run surprisingly high compression ratios on methanol
because it is so insensitive to knock.
 
Also, ethanol carries some oxygen with it. Unless you have something to
compensate (such as modern fuel injection system with an exhaust gas oxygen
sensor) the car will run lean. This is the bureaucratic engineering method
of "automatically" trying to make every car out there run leaner, which the
bureaucratic mind equates with less pollution (more air oxidizes the HC and
CO better, but never mind that it makes more NOx).
 
If I remember correctly the Beretta/Corsica have port fuel injection and an
oxygen sensor, though. Maybe the sensor is shot? It should be tweaking the
fuel injection quantity to get enough fuel in there to avoid running lean.
(But that would in part explain your higher consumption -- more fuel
required to do the same job, more fuel required to run correct mixture).
 
You may wind up going to 89 octane.

Hi, Trond.
 
Two things re pistons.
 
1) There is always somebody at swap meets selling new old stock NPR piston
and cylinder sets. If you REALLY want this stuff, I can buy a set. I've seen
prices of $100, 2 months ago. Several people had them, and as near as I
could tell, nobody was buying. They're not all that desirable, but they're
cheap. If so, tell me how much I'm allowed to spend.
 
2) If you want something better, I can get forged aluminum pistons for you,
cheap. Not as cheap as the NPRs, but not as expensive as the ones you see
advertised (and it's the same piston). It would probably be best if you have
somebody local bore out used iron barrels to take the pistons, but I can
have that done here too. You need to decide on a compression ratio.
 
Mahle and KS prices are fine if you are doing a cutaway engine for concours

And does the Italian piston maker have a secretary that speaks Norwegian?

Dear Jerry:

Our man Sean is the high performance 914 engine specialist. He will be happy
to talk to you about your engine. Just call (404) 427-2844. I, Dr. 914, can
only promote only stock fuel injected or six cylinder conversions all in a
tasteful factory manner (I'm also very old and slow!).

I had written about engine reassembly several days ago - the engine oil
galley plug replacement is as follows:

Parts and tools needed:

small drill bit and sheet metal screw

1 - 37/64 drill bit

grease

2 -  (1) 3/8 pipe tap

3 -  (1) 3/8 pipe tap with 1st 1/2 inch removed and the cutting edges tapered

case sealant

1    3/8 brass pipe threaded plug


Drill a small hole in the suspect oil galley relief plug. Screw a sheetmeal
screw into the plug and pull it out. Stuff tissue into the hole to catch the
filings. Drill the galley plughole with the 37/64 drill and then pull out the
tissue with the filings (in the front, remove the oil filler base to help
clean the debris from the case. Lubricate both taps (the one you cut is to
ensure you can thread the complete length of the hole (it is called a
bottoming tap).

Restuff the hole with tissue and tap the case hole. Using the bottom tap,
complete the threading of the hole. Finally, install the 3/8 inch brass
plumbing plugs with case sealer.

With this repair method completed, we have never again had the galley plugs
loosen. 

You can usually reuse all of the case bolts, but always replace the rod nuts!


There is a very good source for parts and if you send me your name and
address, I'll send you something.

The Saga Continues...

Remember the parts I needed for my '79 928?  The thermo valve and vacuum limiter?

Well!  Thanks to fellow p-filer Sean Simmons (sp?)(who gave me the phone number)
I called up 928 International in Anaheim and got the parts, used, but working
for a third of what the local Porsche Dealer charges.  They were genuinely
friendly and wanted to help, or sell, as the case may be.  Oh, and knowledgeable
too!  So far I'd recommend:

928 International

This is the bracket which mounts your power steering pump, and also contains
the lower balance shaft seal.  Sound like your lower balance shaft seal is
the culprit.  Don't forget to change the mylar washer behind the seal when
you do the fix.  While you're in there, you may want to change the upper
balance shaft seal and the oil pump / crankshaft seal at the same time. 
Easier to get them all at once than one at a time.

Of course, while you're in there, you may as well spend another $40 or so
and replace the belts.  Cheap insurance.

        Do these tires work in the rain as well as they claim ?

        How are they in terms of dry performance and durability ?

        I think there's someone on this list from Goodyear research, parhaps he

Dear Jerry:

Our man Sean is the high performance 914 engine specialist. He will be happy
to talk to you about your engine. Just call (404) 427-2844. I, Dr. 914, can
only promote only stock fuel injected or six cylinder conversions all in a
tasteful factory manner (I'm also very old and slow!).

I had written about engine reassembly several days ago - the engine oil
galley plug replacement is as follows:

Parts and tools needed:

small drill bit and sheet metal screw

1 - 37/64 drill bit

grease

2 -  (1) 3/8 pipe tap

3 -  (1) 3/8 pipe tap with 1st 1/2 inch removed and the cutting edges tapered

case sealant

1    3/8 brass pipe threaded plug


Drill a small hole in the suspect oil galley relief plug. Screw a sheetmeal
screw into the plug and pull it out. Stuff tissue into the hole to catch the
filings. Drill the galley plughole with the 37/64 drill and then pull out the
tissue with the filings (in the front, remove the oil filler base to help
clean the debris from the case. Lubricate both taps (the one you cut is to
ensure you can thread the complete length of the hole (it is called a
bottoming tap).

Restuff the hole with tissue and tap the case hole. Using the bottom tap,
complete the threading of the hole. Finally, install the 3/8 inch brass
plumbing plugs with case sealer.

With this repair method completed, we have never again had the galley plugs
loosen. 

You can usually reuse all of the case bolts, but always replace the rod nuts!


There is a very good source for parts and if you send me your name and
address, I'll send you something.

The Saga Continues...

Remember the parts I needed for my '79 928?  The thermo valve and vacuum limiter?

Well!  Thanks to fellow p-filer Sean Simmons (sp?)(who gave me the phone number)
I called up 928 International in Anaheim and got the parts, used, but working
for a third of what the local Porsche Dealer charges.  They were genuinely
friendly and wanted to help, or sell, as the case may be.  Oh, and knowledgeable
too!  So far I'd recommend:

928 International
2900 East Miraloma Rd
Anaheim, CA  92806

This is the bracket which mounts your power steering pump, and also contains
the lower balance shaft seal.  Sound like your lower balance shaft seal is
the culprit.  Don't forget to change the mylar washer behind the seal when
you do the fix.  While you're in there, you may want to change the upper
balance shaft seal and the oil pump / crankshaft seal at the same time. 
Easier to get them all at once than one at a time.

Of course, while you're in there, you may as well spend another $40 or so
and replace the belts.  Cheap insurance.

Fellow P-philes:

        Has anyone ever used Goodyear Aquatreads ?, Relax, this is not for my 
P-car, but for an econobox...

        Do these tires work in the rain as well as they claim ?

        How are they in terms of dry performance and durability ?

        I think there's someone on this list from Goodyear research, parhaps he 
would like to comment ?

        Any help/comments/suggestions of other tire brands would be greatly 
appreciated.

Hiall,

What's up with the Italians? Since we all know the NPR P/C sets for the 
356's are out of production, and this in time will lead to shortage of the 
above, I decided to confront some Italian piston (Gemini SRL) makers with this. 

Made a call to the company(shop?), of course only the Italian speaking 
secretary was at place. This was *NOT* the moment to try my few Italian 
phrases, and I decided to say 'Ciao Bella' and call later. 
(My experience with Italian women is that you either don't want them at all, 
or much closer than at the other end of a telephone line 8^)

After hours at the drawing table, a few days with my nose buried in 
technichal Porsche books and about 2 gallons of *BLACK* coffe, I sent away a 
fax. 

This week( sent it 2, maybe 3 months ago) I got a fax from them reading; 
'they did not want to make the pistons, not even calculate how many at what 
price'.

Even worse is Mahle and Kolbenschmidt, they didn't even bother answer my 
request for oversized pistons. Ha,...that's how they'll lose customers.

What has happened to Service,....I mean; it's not like this is an old car, 
only 36 years! That's nothing these days.... :)

Phew!  Been thinking about your post and considering the situation where 
someone tries to car jack the baby at gun point. Is this a common experience? 
My personal alarm is a snub nosed S&W .38 airweight, hollow points,  in an 
ankle holster but i realize this is not always a viable alternative. Need to 
shoot before the thief gets in the car.  Hollow points do make a splatter.   
 
 I've used "passive " alarms, the one that goes off with car motion or door 
openings. Also put in a manual  battery shutoff switch(that doesn't shut off 
the alarm) haven't lost a car yet but I am very particular about where I leave 
them.  Realize that these systems don't work in a car jacking situation but 
have some thoughts and questions about what does. 
 
Tracking devices:  How do these interface with the fuzz?  If someone hijacks 
your car at gunpoint or knifepoint or whatever and you can track the car, do 
the police give chase or do they wait until the car stops and then go get it?  
Don't need the pcar involved in a high speed chase. 
 
Probably the best scenario is one where the car disables itself in 60 seconds 
or so.  That way, you can make some tracks, get help and hopefully collect the 
car.  Do these alarms do this also?  How are they triggered?  Do they track 
with gps and do they have their own power supply?  Any alarm experts out there? 
 
A friend with a 59 Corvette that had been stolen installed a passive alarm, 
battery shutoff, fuel shutoff and  tear gas cannister under the dash that had 
thin hose under the steering column.  It was activated by a solenoid, 15 
seconds after the door was opened if the driver didn't deactivate it.  People 
attempted to steal it twice with no success.

Would appreciate input on anti-theft and alarm devices for a 911,  especially
tracking devices such as Lo jack and Auto trac.  (I live in L.A. and last
Porsche I owned was taken at gunpoint in 1987.  I decided that best
protection was to not own one, but the new 911 (933) has bewitched me and
eroded the left side of my brain).

Try "Troy Lee Designs". I think he has a shop in Ca. I don't have the 
number. He does helmets for a lot of SuperCross riders and some Indy car 
drivers (Michael Andretti, Paul Tracy).  I have seen the number in 
"Motorcyclist" magazine.  Also there is Chris Wood of Air Trix Designs in

Subject: RE: Reformulated Gas


If you are referring to the gas being forced on us in the NJ/PA area, well 
it sucks.  My two '88 4 cylinder Chevy Corsica's which were running well on 
Mobil regular gas went from 25 MPG down to 21 MPG.  Does this gas put out 
25% less pollution?  I'm burning nearly 20% more gas, thus more pollution 
per mile.

Both cars also began pinging and rattling the valves on moderate hills with 
the regular grade, which worked just fine before the oxygenated gas hit the 
pumps.  Now I'm forced to pay for a mid-grade in both cars.  And off course 
all grades went up in price 5-10 cents.

Isn't 87 octane the same regardless of formula?  I think Mobil needs to 
re-calibrate their octane gauge.  Next tank I'm going to try Shell or Hess 
regular and see if their 87 octane works any better.

I have always run Premium in the 928 and notice very little change.  It's 
just a bit down on power.  The idle also seems to be affected, it's not 
smooth like it was.  Seems to surge ever so slightly when parked.  I have 
not checked the MPG in a while, but it's not too far off.

Subject: RE: Help!  Car needs to rest 45 minutes after every 10 miles


Just a note of thanks to all those who offered suggestions to my last 
problem.  The problem turned out to be what no one expected, the computer 
brain, a $1,600 part.  This was determined after the Fuel pump, pump relay, 
fuel filter and three fuel pressure regulators (which they insist were near 
death) were all replaced without resolving the problem.

The range of diagnoses, both mechanical and electrical made my head spin 
when it became apparent just how much can go wrong, and how hard it is to 
diagnose these complex computerized toys we drive!

Brian at Ray Catena Porsche in Edison, NJ (where the car was serviced) did 
make up for most of the incorrect diagnosis.  They sold me the computer 
brain at cost (there's ALLOT of profit in there!) and cutting out much of 
the labor to make up for the bad diagnosis earlier.  Total cost for all the 
new parts above was just under $2,100.  They also repaired a problem I had 
with my shifter linkage which involved a $40 part, but charged me no labor. 


Since the brain lists for $1,600+ and there would be some hours spent to 
diagnose and repair this problem no matter what, I must say I'm satisfied 
with the outcome.  From what I hear, fuel pumps typically go at about 
100,000 miles, which is where I'm at now.  Since replacement time was 
probably coming up shortly, I consider this a mixed blessing.

Can anyone tell me if there is there anything else that typically lets loose 
at the 100,000 mile mark on a 928?  Please no (even if you must lie).

Phew!  Been thinking about your post and considering the situation where 
someone tries to car jack the baby at gun point. Is this a common experience? 
My personal alarm is a snub nosed S&W .38 airweight, hollow points,  in an 
ankle holster but i realize this is not always a viable alternative. Need to 
shoot before the thief gets in the car.  Hollow points do make a splatter.   
 
 I've used "passive " alarms, the one that goes off with car motion or door 
openings. Also put in a manual  battery shutoff switch(that doesn't shut off 
the alarm) haven't lost a car yet but I am very particular about where I leave 
them.  Realize that these systems don't work in a car jacking situation but 
have some thoughts and questions about what does. 
 
Tracking devices:  How do these interface with the fuzz?  If someone hijacks 
your car at gunpoint or knifepoint or whatever and you can track the car, do 
the police give chase or do they wait until the car stops and then go get it?  
Don't need the pcar involved in a high speed chase. 
 
Probably the best scenario is one where the car disables itself in 60 seconds 
or so.  That way, you can make some tracks, get help and hopefully collect the 
car.  Do these alarms do this also?  How are they triggered?  Do they track 
with gps and do they have their own power supply?  Any alarm experts out there? 
 
A friend with a 59 Corvette that had been stolen installed a passive alarm, 
battery shutoff, fuel shutoff and  tear gas cannister under the dash that had 
thin hose under the steering column.  It was activated by a solenoid, 15 
seconds after the door was opened if the driver didn't deactivate it.  People 
attempted to steal it twice with no success.

Would appreciate input on anti-theft and alarm devices for a 911,  especially
tracking devices such as Lo jack and Auto trac.  (I live in L.A. and last
Porsche I owned was taken at gunpoint in 1987.  I decided that best
protection was to not own one, but the new 911 (933) has bewitched me and
eroded the left side of my brain).

Try "Troy Lee Designs". I think he has a shop in Ca. I don't have the

Subject: RE: Reformulated Gas


If you are referring to the gas being forced on us in the NJ/PA area, well 
it sucks.  My two '88 4 cylinder Chevy Corsica's which were running well on 
Mobil regular gas went from 25 MPG down to 21 MPG.  Does this gas put out 
25% less pollution?  I'm burning nearly 20% more gas, thus more pollution 
per mile.

Both cars also began pinging and rattling the valves on moderate hills with 
the regular grade, which worked just fine before the oxygenated gas hit the 
pumps.  Now I'm forced to pay for a mid-grade in both cars.  And off course 
all grades went up in price 5-10 cents.

Isn't 87 octane the same regardless of formula?  I think Mobil needs to 
re-calibrate their octane gauge.  Next tank I'm going to try Shell or Hess 
regular and see if their 87 octane works any better.

I have always run Premium in the 928 and notice very little change.  It's 
just a bit down on power.  The idle also seems to be affected, it's not 
smooth like it was.  Seems to surge ever so slightly when parked.  I have 
not checked the MPG in a while, but it's not too far off.

Subject: RE: Help!  Car needs to rest 45 minutes after every 10 miles


Just a note of thanks to all those who offered suggestions to my last 
problem.  The problem turned out to be what no one expected, the computer 
brain, a $1,600 part.  This was determined after the Fuel pump, pump relay, 
fuel filter and three fuel pressure regulators (which they insist were near 
death) were all replaced without resolving the problem.

The range of diagnoses, both mechanical and electrical made my head spin 
when it became apparent just how much can go wrong, and how hard it is to 
diagnose these complex computerized toys we drive!

Brian at Ray Catena Porsche in Edison, NJ (where the car was serviced) did 
make up for most of the incorrect diagnosis.  They sold me the computer 
brain at cost (there's ALLOT of profit in there!) and cutting out much of 
the labor to make up for the bad diagnosis earlier.  Total cost for all the 
new parts above was just under $2,100.  They also repaired a problem I had 
with my shifter linkage which involved a $40 part, but charged me no labor. 


Since the brain lists for $1,600+ and there would be some hours spent to 
diagnose and repair this problem no matter what, I must say I'm satisfied 
with the outcome.  From what I hear, fuel pumps typically go at about 
100,000 miles, which is where I'm at now.  Since replacement time was 
probably coming up shortly, I consider this a mixed blessing.

Can anyone tell me if there is there anything else that typically lets loose 
at the 100,000 mile mark on a 928?  Please no (even if you must lie).

is way too expensive around here for a car that doesn't need the extra point

Perhaps Amoco is better now with the clear gas, but I had problems with it 
in my highly modified Trans Am several years ago.  The high compression 400

I've always tried first for AMOCO, then SUN (Most places, SUN offers higher
octane ratings that anyone else I've found) and then SHELL.  I've never had
problems in any car with any of these three.  Plus SHELL contains TECHRON.
YMMV, natch

Subject: 914: What would you do?


First off, I would like to thank everyone for all the advice on rebuilding
914 engines.  I have been listening avidly to all the ideas going by.  My
'engine-rebuild' files is up to 300K.  Fantastic!

I am trying to get a stripped 914 back on the street.  I got it without
engine/tranny/etc.  I have a number of transmissions from 'working' 914s so
that isn't the problem.  The question is what to do for an engine.  I have a
1.8L engine that came from someone who told me that it 'ran well' when he
pulled it out of his car.  I would like to use this engine to put in the
914.  What would you do before putting it in the car?  This is going to be a
short term solution - I don't want to do a full rebuild on the engine right
away.  I would like to have the car mobile while working on a better engine
for it.  Also, if the engine blows up I will just call the wife and ask her
to come with the tow vehicle and trailer to pick me up!  So that isn't
a big problem.

What is possible to check on a 914 engine without tearing the whole thing
apart to verify its operations?  Or am I dreaming - and do it 'right' the
first time.  Am I risking more by using it this way then by taking it apart
to at least verify that everything is together correctly?  What are
the Pros and Cons?

BTW - this is for purely street use.  Building the engine for IT/PCA
will be a separate operation to make it as bulletproof as I can 
(so that we can get our licenses).  The core for the race engine
would be from a different engine.

I don't think so. Ethanol does not complex with oxygen gas. There is no
reason to associate ethanol in fuel with higher oxygen gas (02)
content. Of course ethanol contains an oxygen atom (CH3-CH2-O-H). Many
of the molecules in good old fashioned gas (no modern anti-polution
additives) contain atomic oxygen as well. It is unlikely the combustion
of ethanol produces significant amounts of oxygen (02) but of course it
will produce molecules containing oxygen (NOx, CO, CO2, H2O, etc).

Ethanol is very bad for some applications because it does complex with
water. Fuel containing ethanol will have a higher molecular water
content than otherwise. This can accelerate rust in fuel system
components (like the mechanical innards of MFI units). I'm sure ethanol
has other bad effects as well in engines designed to burn classical
gasoline. 

It turns out molecular oxygen (O2) is more soluble in pure hydrocarbons
than in aqueous solution. This would indicate the wetter the fuel is,
the less oxygen it contains. I have not checked in the literature
though to see if this has been empirically found in gasoline.

before the problem occurred. The head temperature sensor causes, when failed,
the exact problem you speak of and the problem only occurred after you
replaced the sensor! This means the head temperature sensor is defective or
not grounding. If you installed the part with antisieze or lubricant, it will
insulate the sensor from grounding and cause the problem. As we previously
discussed, grounding the control unit lead to the battery negative terminal
will allow the 914 to run. However, there is no real way to test the sensor
as a defective one could read the proper ohmage one minute and not the next.
(The value at 40 degrees should be 2800 ohms.)

I'm sure your engine case is fine. Many mistakenly install the fan without
the spacer (especially if they have just removed the air conditioning drive
pulley) and use lengthy fan bolts. This ruins the front seal, causes an oil
leak and slightly burns the engine case. 

If you find that your engine needs rebuilding, it is easy to do yourself. The
hardest part is finding a competent machine shop to do machining to the case,
crank, rods and heads.

Thirty-five hundred dollars (11/94) is a great buy for a rust-free '74 2.0
and I wish you good luck with it!

We have never heard a bad word about Parts Heaven. They have always been

Dear Mike,

Check the D jettronic fuel pressure and watch the gauge needle (28-30 lbs.)
while the car is running. (Connect it between the two driver's side
injectors) If the needle starts to drop and then the car stalls, you are
losing fuel pressure. If the car stalls and then the fuel pressure drops
something else is happening such as head temperature sensor failure and
sudden flooding. We responded to that particular fix previously.

Dear Dave,

The front access cover is on top of the center tunnel inside the 914 and just
to the right of the wooden floor board. You will have to remove the center
tunnel carpeting to see it!

What I meant by "reach through the front access cover and center tunnel" is
that you use both the center tunnel access plate hole and the hole in the
left side of the center tunnel when working on the front of the clutch cable
and pedal cluster.

Dear Allan,

When mating the 3.0 engine to the original 914 transmission, we do use the
earlier 911S alluminum pressure plate and clutch disc. We have no problem
handling the torque with this setup. The flywheel is actually a redrilled
early one and it really works perfectly. The alternative is to use, if you
can find one, a 1970-71 911 case with the provision of the push type clutch.
This allows use of the heavier pressure plate and clutch disc while
eliminating the gizmo 914 clutch roller assembly.

We always replace the CV axles with brand new assemblies. Used, worn ones,
although inspected and repacked, always seem to break under the new found
torque. 

Your 914-6 conversion sounds great. We would love to see it or at least get a
picture for our gallery.

Finally, Allen, we are personal friends with George Vellios and have sold his
916 transmission conversion kit for years. George was kind enough to invest
his money in tooling to provide all of us with the means to convert the 915
gearbox to the 916 type. What he did not provide was the shift linkage. That
is probably where the confusion started. He makes the transmission conversion
kit; we make the linkage kit. The slow southern mind, here, with whom you

I had my first experience the other day driving my '73S in the rain.  I dont
know if its the bump steer problem that I still haven't taken care of or 
what, but the steering wheel wanted to jerk out of my hands on the freeway
everytime I hit some deep water pockets.  The front end would hydroplane
while I was trying to keep control of the steering wheel. 

Is this normal for the early 911's?  Do I have to take care of the bump
steer to eliminate this rain driving problem?  Tires have 50% tread left.

Thanks for the tip, I did not know that Shell had Techron in it.  I usually

is way too expensive around here for a car that doesn't need the extra point 
over others 93 octane premium.

Perhaps Amoco is better now with the clear gas, but I had problems with it 
in my highly modified Trans Am several years ago.  The high compression 400 
engine I had in it would ping with Amoco Premium, but worked OK with Mobil 
and Hess Premium, which I have pretty much stayed with since.  It might be

I've always tried first for AMOCO, then SUN (Most places, SUN offers higher

Subject: 914: What would you do?


First off, I would like to thank everyone for all the advice on rebuilding
914 engines.  I have been listening avidly to all the ideas going by.  My
'engine-rebuild' files is up to 300K.  Fantastic!

I am trying to get a stripped 914 back on the street.  I got it without
engine/tranny/etc.  I have a number of transmissions from 'working' 914s so
that isn't the problem.  The question is what to do for an engine.  I have a
1.8L engine that came from someone who told me that it 'ran well' when he
pulled it out of his car.  I would like to use this engine to put in the
914.  What would you do before putting it in the car?  This is going to be a
short term solution - I don't want to do a full rebuild on the engine right
away.  I would like to have the car mobile while working on a better engine
for it.  Also, if the engine blows up I will just call the wife and ask her
to come with the tow vehicle and trailer to pick me up!  So that isn't
a big problem.

What is possible to check on a 914 engine without tearing the whole thing
apart to verify its operations?  Or am I dreaming - and do it 'right' the
first time.  Am I risking more by using it this way then by taking it apart
to at least verify that everything is together correctly?  What are
the Pros and Cons?

BTW - this is for purely street use.  Building the engine for IT/PCA
will be a separate operation to make it as bulletproof as I can 
(so that we can get our licenses).  The core for the race engine
would be from a different engine.

	"Also, ethanol carries some oxygen with it."

I don't think so. Ethanol does not complex with oxygen gas. There is no
reason to associate ethanol in fuel with higher oxygen gas (02)
content. Of course ethanol contains an oxygen atom (CH3-CH2-O-H). Many
of the molecules in good old fashioned gas (no modern anti-polution
additives) contain atomic oxygen as well. It is unlikely the combustion
of ethanol produces significant amounts of oxygen (02) but of course it
will produce molecules containing oxygen (NOx, CO, CO2, H2O, etc).

Ethanol is very bad for some applications because it does complex with
water. Fuel containing ethanol will have a higher molecular water
content than otherwise. This can accelerate rust in fuel system
components (like the mechanical innards of MFI units). I'm sure ethanol
has other bad effects as well in engines designed to burn classical
gasoline. 

It turns out molecular oxygen (O2) is more soluble in pure hydrocarbons
than in aqueous solution. This would indicate the wetter the fuel is,
the less oxygen it contains. I have not checked in the literature
though to see if this has been empirically found in gasoline.

You can get very nice 356 pistons from Shasta Design, or you can get
Arias and Venolia to build you *ANYTHING*. I think we're paying like $125 
each for some pretty high custom 93.5mm EP 914 pistons I came up with...
Turn time is about 4 weeks from the time you agree on the drawings.

Getting cylinders is another matter. You *SHOULD* be able to get
used cast iron cylinders and overbore them some. That's harder with
the SC/912s of course. I don't know who makes cylinders for air-cooled
motors, but I know who to ask... I guess I have a task for the weekend.

Verdict: Ben Evans says get this vid, it is the business.
I won't issue spoilers, except that this is the hottest
porsche motorcar porn video that I have ever seen. Derek
Bell thrashes just about every sinlge racing Porsche of
note round the track, and narrates the history of Porsche
racing with loads of brilliant archive film and interviews
with drivers of note. The highlights for me are Bell driving
a wonderful 1500 cc 4 cam 356 speedster, the engine sounded
marvelous, it looked brilliant, and also Bell driving the
917 and overcome with emotion and enthusiasm at the reunion with
the beast, and finally Bell thrashing the 962, and finally
spinning it!

This vid is a must for any porschephile. I ordered mine from

Jay,

As George says, sounds like a bad slave or master cylinder.  The fact
that the pedal won't return suggests that air has invaded the system,
probably getting past a bad seal in the cylinder.

Look for leaking fluid as a sign of which cylinder has failed.  A
failed master will typically leak into the driver's footwell and is
identified by wet toes on the driver's foot.  A failed slave will
show leakage from underneath the car, perhaps onto the ground or
the clutch bell housing.

Subject: '73S in Rain

I had my first experience the other day driving my '73S in the rain.  I dont
know if its the bump steer problem that I still haven't taken care of or 
what, but the steering wheel wanted to jerk out of my hands on the freeway
everytime I hit some deep water pockets.  The front end would hydroplane
while I was trying to keep control of the steering wheel. 

Is this normal for the early 911's?  Do I have to take care of the bump
steer to eliminate this rain driving problem?  Tires have 50% tread left.

Dear Josh:

Whenever diagnosing any problem, we always think about the last thing we did
before the problem occurred. The head temperature sensor causes, when failed,
the exact problem you speak of and the problem only occurred after you
replaced the sensor! This means the head temperature sensor is defective or
not grounding. If you installed the part with antisieze or lubricant, it will
insulate the sensor from grounding and cause the problem. As we previously
discussed, grounding the control unit lead to the battery negative terminal
will allow the 914 to run. However, there is no real way to test the sensor
as a defective one could read the proper ohmage one minute and not the next.
(The value at 40 degrees should be 2800 ohms.)

I'm sure your engine case is fine. Many mistakenly install the fan without
the spacer (especially if they have just removed the air conditioning drive
pulley) and use lengthy fan bolts. This ruins the front seal, causes an oil
leak and slightly burns the engine case. 

If you find that your engine needs rebuilding, it is easy to do yourself. The
hardest part is finding a competent machine shop to do machining to the case,
crank, rods and heads.

Thirty-five hundred dollars (11/94) is a great buy for a rust-free '74 2.0
and I wish you good luck with it!

We have never heard a bad word about Parts Heaven. They have always been
gentlemen and stood behind their work. Everyone is entitled to make a mistake
and reasonable toleration is the call word of the day.

Dear Mike,

Check the D jettronic fuel pressure and watch the gauge needle (28-30 lbs.)
while the car is running. (Connect it between the two driver's side
injectors) If the needle starts to drop and then the car stalls, you are
losing fuel pressure. If the car stalls and then the fuel pressure drops
something else is happening such as head temperature sensor failure and
sudden flooding. We responded to that particular fix previously.

The front access cover is on top of the center tunnel inside the 914 and just

What I meant by "reach through the front access cover and center tunnel" is

Subject: Re: 914/6 - 915 Shift Linkage


Dear Allan,

When mating the 3.0 engine to the original 914 transmission, we do use the
earlier 911S alluminum pressure plate and clutch disc. We have no problem
handling the torque with this setup. The flywheel is actually a redrilled
early one and it really works perfectly. The alternative is to use, if you
can find one, a 1970-71 911 case with the provision of the push type clutch.
This allows use of the heavier pressure plate and clutch disc while
eliminating the gizmo 914 clutch roller assembly.

We always replace the CV axles with brand new assemblies. Used, worn ones,
although inspected and repacked, always seem to break under the new found
torque. 

Your 914-6 conversion sounds great. We would love to see it or at least get a
picture for our gallery.

Finally, Allen, we are personal friends with George Vellios and have sold his
916 transmission conversion kit for years. George was kind enough to invest
his money in tooling to provide all of us with the means to convert the 915
gearbox to the 916 type. What he did not provide was the shift linkage. That
is probably where the confusion started. He makes the transmission conversion
kit; we make the linkage kit. The slow southern mind, here, with whom you
spoke, probably just didn't understand what you were asking!

Subject: Reformulated gas

 
Hi, Bill.
 
What you have experienced may be due not to a problem with octane rating but
rather with the energy content of the fuel. Adding loads of ethanol to the
fuel decreases the energy content; ethanol (or methanol) has less BTU per
gallon than gasoline. So you need to burn more gallons of it to do the same
job. This is great for the gas retailers too, as you have to buy more of the
stuff and it's already higher priced. You lose both ways. And you are a
one-man farm subsidy, supporting Archer-Daniels-Midland (the distiller, and
maker of Jack Daniels) and all the corn growers. Maybe we need to boycott
Jack Daniels? (I prefer the imported stuff anyway). Picket the still, get
big media coverage of irate motorists? Look at all the coverage the people
protesting outside the Federal Reserve got the other day.
 
Octane rating is not related to energy content. Alcohol has lower energy
content but actually has a very high octane rating, in fact it's an octane
booster. Indy cars can run surprisingly high compression ratios on methanol
because it is so insensitive to knock.
 
Also, ethanol carries some oxygen with it. Unless you have something to
compensate (such as modern fuel injection system with an exhaust gas oxygen
sensor) the car will run lean. This is the bureaucratic engineering method
of "automatically" trying to make every car out there run leaner, which the
bureaucratic mind equates with less pollution (more air oxidizes the HC and
CO better, but never mind that it makes more NOx).
 
If I remember correctly the Beretta/Corsica have port fuel injection and an
oxygen sensor, though. Maybe the sensor is shot? It should be tweaking the
fuel injection quantity to get enough fuel in there to avoid running lean.
(But that would in part explain your higher consumption -- more fuel
required to do the same job, more fuel required to run correct mixture).
 
You may wind up going to 89 octane.

Hi, Trond.
 
Two things re pistons.
 
1) There is always somebody at swap meets selling new old stock NPR piston
and cylinder sets. If you REALLY want this stuff, I can buy a set. I've seen
prices of $100, 2 months ago. Several people had them, and as near as I
could tell, nobody was buying. They're not all that desirable, but they're
cheap. If so, tell me how much I'm allowed to spend.
 
2) If you want something better, I can get forged aluminum pistons for you,
cheap. Not as cheap as the NPRs, but not as expensive as the ones you see
advertised (and it's the same piston). It would probably be best if you have
somebody local bore out used iron barrels to take the pistons, but I can
have that done here too. You need to decide on a compression ratio.
 
Mahle and KS prices are fine if you are doing a cutaway engine for concours

And does the Italian piston maker have a secretary that speaks Norwegian?

only promote only stock fuel injected or six cylinder conversions all in a
tasteful factory manner (I'm also very old and slow!).

I had written about engine reassembly several days ago - the engine oil
galley plug replacement is as follows:

Parts and tools needed:

small drill bit and sheet metal screw

1 - 37/64 drill bit

grease

2 -  (1) 3/8 pipe tap

3 -  (1) 3/8 pipe tap with 1st 1/2 inch removed and the cutting edges tapered

case sealant

1    3/8 brass pipe threaded plug


Drill a small hole in the suspect oil galley relief plug. Screw a sheetmeal
screw into the plug and pull it out. Stuff tissue into the hole to catch the
filings. Drill the galley plughole with the 37/64 drill and then pull out the
tissue with the filings (in the front, remove the oil filler base to help
clean the debris from the case. Lubricate both taps (the one you cut is to
ensure you can thread the complete length of the hole (it is called a
bottoming tap).

Restuff the hole with tissue and tap the case hole. Using the bottom tap,
complete the threading of the hole. Finally, install the 3/8 inch brass
plumbing plugs with case sealer.

With this repair method completed, we have never again had the galley plugs
loosen. 

You can usually reuse all of the case bolts, but always replace the rod nuts!


There is a very good source for parts and if you send me your name and

This is the bracket which mounts your power steering pump, and also contains
the lower balance shaft seal.  Sound like your lower balance shaft seal is
the culprit.  Don't forget to change the mylar washer behind the seal when
you do the fix.  While you're in there, you may want to change the upper
balance shaft seal and the oil pump / crankshaft seal at the same time. 
Easier to get them all at once than one at a time.

Of course, while you're in there, you may as well spend another $40 or so
and replace the belts.  Cheap insurance.

Hiall,

What's up with the Italians? Since we all know the NPR P/C sets for the 
356's are out of production, and this in time will lead to shortage of the 
above, I decided to confront some Italian piston (Gemini SRL) makers with this. 

Made a call to the company(shop?), of course only the Italian speaking 
secretary was at place. This was *NOT* the moment to try my few Italian 
phrases, and I decided to say 'Ciao Bella' and call later. 
(My experience with Italian women is that you either don't want them at all, 
or much closer than at the other end of a telephone line 8^)

After hours at the drawing table, a few days with my nose buried in 
technichal Porsche books and about 2 gallons of *BLACK* coffe, I sent away a 
fax. 

This week( sent it 2, maybe 3 months ago) I got a fax from them reading; 
'they did not want to make the pistons, not even calculate how many at what

Phew!  Been thinking about your post and considering the situation where 
someone tries to car jack the baby at gun point. Is this a common experience? 
My personal alarm is a snub nosed S&W .38 airweight, hollow points,  in an 
ankle holster but i realize this is not always a viable alternative. Need to 
shoot before the thief gets in the car.  Hollow points do make a splatter.   
 
 I've used "passive " alarms, the one that goes off with car motion or door 
openings. Also put in a manual  battery shutoff switch(that doesn't shut off 
the alarm) haven't lost a car yet but I am very particular about where I leave 
them.  Realize that these systems don't work in a car jacking situation but 
have some thoughts and questions about what does. 
 
Tracking devices:  How do these interface with the fuzz?  If someone hijacks 
your car at gunpoint or knifepoint or whatever and you can track the car, do 
the police give chase or do they wait until the car stops and then go get it?  
Don't need the pcar involved in a high speed chase. 
 
Probably the best scenario is one where the car disables itself in 60 seconds 
or so.  That way, you can make some tracks, get help and hopefully collect the 
car.  Do these alarms do this also?  How are they triggered?  Do they track 
with gps and do they have their own power supply?  Any alarm experts out there? 
 
A friend with a 59 Corvette that had been stolen installed a passive alarm, 
battery shutoff, fuel shutoff and  tear gas cannister under the dash that had 
thin hose under the steering column.  It was activated by a solenoid, 15 
seconds after the door was opened if the driver didn't deactivate it.  People 
attempted to steal it twice with no success.

Would appreciate input on anti-theft and alarm devices for a 911,  especially
tracking devices such as Lo jack and Auto trac.  (I live in L.A. and last
Porsche I owned was taken at gunpoint in 1987.  I decided that best
protection was to not own one, but the new 911 (933) has bewitched me and

Subject: RE: Reformulated Gas


If you are referring to the gas being forced on us in the NJ/PA area, well 
it sucks.  My two '88 4 cylinder Chevy Corsica's which were running well on 
Mobil regular gas went from 25 MPG down to 21 MPG.  Does this gas put out 
25% less pollution?  I'm burning nearly 20% more gas, thus more pollution 
per mile.

Both cars also began pinging and rattling the valves on moderate hills with 
the regular grade, which worked just fine before the oxygenated gas hit the 
pumps.  Now I'm forced to pay for a mid-grade in both cars.  And off course 
all grades went up in price 5-10 cents.

Isn't 87 octane the same regardless of formula?  I think Mobil needs to 
re-calibrate their octane gauge.  Next tank I'm going to try Shell or Hess 
regular and see if their 87 octane works any better.

I have always run Premium in the 928 and notice very little change.  It's 
just a bit down on power.  The idle also seems to be affected, it's not 
smooth like it was.  Seems to surge ever so slightly when parked.  I have 
not checked the MPG in a while, but it's not too far off.

Subject: RE: Help!  Car needs to rest 45 minutes after every 10 miles


Just a note of thanks to all those who offered suggestions to my last 
problem.  The problem turned out to be what no one expected, the computer 
brain, a $1,600 part.  This was determined after the Fuel pump, pump relay, 
fuel filter and three fuel pressure regulators (which they insist were near 
death) were all replaced without resolving the problem.

The range of diagnoses, both mechanical and electrical made my head spin 
when it became apparent just how much can go wrong, and how hard it is to 
diagnose these complex computerized toys we drive!

Brian at Ray Catena Porsche in Edison, NJ (where the car was serviced) did 
make up for most of the incorrect diagnosis.  They sold me the computer 
brain at cost (there's ALLOT of profit in there!) and cutting out much of 
the labor to make up for the bad diagnosis earlier.  Total cost for all the 
new parts above was just under $2,100.  They also repaired a problem I had 
with my shifter linkage which involved a $40 part, but charged me no labor. 


Since the brain lists for $1,600+ and there would be some hours spent to 
diagnose and repair this problem no matter what, I must say I'm satisfied 
with the outcome.  From what I hear, fuel pumps typically go at about 
100,000 miles, which is where I'm at now.  Since replacement time was 
probably coming up shortly, I consider this a mixed blessing.

Can anyone tell me if there is there anything else that typically lets loose 
at the 100,000 mile mark on a 928?  Please no (even if you must lie).

Thanks for the tip, I did not know that Shell had Techron in it.  I usually 
buy a bottle and add it every few tanks.  Sunoco's high octane (94 I think) 
is way too expensive around here for a car that doesn't need the extra point 
over others 93 octane premium.

Perhaps Amoco is better now with the clear gas, but I had problems with it 
in my highly modified Trans Am several years ago.  The high compression 400 
engine I had in it would ping with Amoco Premium, but worked OK with Mobil 
and Hess Premium, which I have pretty much stayed with since.  It might be

I've always tried first for AMOCO, then SUN (Most places, SUN offers higher

Subject: 914: What would you do?


First off, I would like to thank everyone for all the advice on rebuilding
914 engines.  I have been listening avidly to all the ideas going by.  My
'engine-rebuild' files is up to 300K.  Fantastic!

I am trying to get a stripped 914 back on the street.  I got it without
engine/tranny/etc.  I have a number of transmissions from 'working' 914s so
that isn't the problem.  The question is what to do for an engine.  I have a
1.8L engine that came from someone who told me that it 'ran well' when he
pulled it out of his car.  I would like to use this engine to put in the
914.  What would you do before putting it in the car?  This is going to be a
short term solution - I don't want to do a full rebuild on the engine right
away.  I would like to have the car mobile while working on a better engine
for it.  Also, if the engine blows up I will just call the wife and ask her
to come with the tow vehicle and trailer to pick me up!  So that isn't
a big problem.

What is possible to check on a 914 engine without tearing the whole thing
apart to verify its operations?  Or am I dreaming - and do it 'right' the
first time.  Am I risking more by using it this way then by taking it apart
to at least verify that everything is together correctly?  What are
the Pros and Cons?

BTW - this is for purely street use.  Building the engine for IT/PCA
will be a separate operation to make it as bulletproof as I can 
(so that we can get our licenses).  The core for the race engine
would be from a different engine.

I don't think so. Ethanol does not complex with oxygen gas. There is no
reason to associate ethanol in fuel with higher oxygen gas (02)
content. Of course ethanol contains an oxygen atom (CH3-CH2-O-H). Many
of the molecules in good old fashioned gas (no modern anti-polution
additives) contain atomic oxygen as well. It is unlikely the combustion
of ethanol produces significant amounts of oxygen (02) but of course it
will produce molecules containing oxygen (NOx, CO, CO2, H2O, etc).

Ethanol is very bad for some applications because it does complex with
water. Fuel containing ethanol will have a higher molecular water
content than otherwise. This can accelerate rust in fuel system
components (like the mechanical innards of MFI units). I'm sure ethanol
has other bad effects as well in engines designed to burn classical
gasoline. 

It turns out molecular oxygen (O2) is more soluble in pure hydrocarbons
than in aqueous solution. This would indicate the wetter the fuel is,
the less oxygen it contains. I have not checked in the literature
though to see if this has been empirically found in gasoline.

Subject: Re: 914 Tranny woes...


Dear Josh:

Whenever diagnosing any problem, we always think about the last thing we did
before the problem occurred. The head temperature sensor causes, when failed,
the exact problem you speak of and the problem only occurred after you
replaced the sensor! This means the head temperature sensor is defective or
not grounding. If you installed the part with antisieze or lubricant, it will
insulate the sensor from grounding and cause the problem. As we previously
discussed, grounding the control unit lead to the battery negative terminal
will allow the 914 to run. However, there is no real way to test the sensor
as a defective one could read the proper ohmage one minute and not the next.
(The value at 40 degrees should be 2800 ohms.)

I'm sure your engine case is fine. Many mistakenly install the fan without
the spacer (especially if they have just removed the air conditioning drive
pulley) and use lengthy fan bolts. This ruins the front seal, causes an oil
leak and slightly burns the engine case. 

If you find that your engine needs rebuilding, it is easy to do yourself. The
hardest part is finding a competent machine shop to do machining to the case,
crank, rods and heads.

Thirty-five hundred dollars (11/94) is a great buy for a rust-free '74 2.0
and I wish you good luck with it!

We have never heard a bad word about Parts Heaven. They have always been

Dear Mike,

Check the D jettronic fuel pressure and watch the gauge needle (28-30 lbs.)
while the car is running. (Connect it between the two driver's side
injectors) If the needle starts to drop and then the car stalls, you are
losing fuel pressure. If the car stalls and then the fuel pressure drops
something else is happening such as head temperature sensor failure and
sudden flooding. We responded to that particular fix previously.

Dear Allan,

When mating the 3.0 engine to the original 914 transmission, we do use the
earlier 911S alluminum pressure plate and clutch disc. We have no problem
handling the torque with this setup. The flywheel is actually a redrilled
early one and it really works perfectly. The alternative is to use, if you
can find one, a 1970-71 911 case with the provision of the push type clutch.
This allows use of the heavier pressure plate and clutch disc while
eliminating the gizmo 914 clutch roller assembly.

We always replace the CV axles with brand new assemblies. Used, worn ones,
although inspected and repacked, always seem to break under the new found
torque. 

Your 914-6 conversion sounds great. We would love to see it or at least get a
picture for our gallery.

Finally, Allen, we are personal friends with George Vellios and have sold his
916 transmission conversion kit for years. George was kind enough to invest
his money in tooling to provide all of us with the means to convert the 915
gearbox to the 916 type. What he did not provide was the shift linkage. That
is probably where the confusion started. He makes the transmission conversion
kit; we make the linkage kit. The slow southern mind, here, with whom you
spoke, probably just didn't understand what you were asking!

  I was also given the number for Jason Beam but it's his
  parents 'phone number (calls to be forwarded) so I wont list
  it here.
  
  Anyway, of all the email I received Troy Lee Designs had the
  most raves. I 'phoned them up & they were very helpful. Costs
  start at $350 & go up to over $1,100. Turn around time is
  about 10 weeks.
  
  Air Trix just had one of their (his? It might be a one-man
  band) helmets in Motorcyclist magazine & it looked great.
  Costs start at $220 & go up. Turn around time is about 3
  weeks. The helmet shown in the magazine cost about $350.
  
  After calling the above two I didn't call the others. I
  really need to come up with a design before I bother anyone
  else. The people I talked to suggested looking through
  magazines like Motorcross Action for ideas, but they'll paint
  anything like, well... Anything!
  
  Just include a detailed written description, photos from a
  magazine & color samples with your helmet to get them going.
  They'll call you when they receive the helmet & description &
  confirm what you want & give you the price.
  
  Anyway, that's what I've found out.
  
  It's probably not good for a couple of seconds at Summit
  Point though.

Hi,

according to the latest issue of Automobile magazine,
the 993 carrera 4 handles so well on dry pavement that 
it has no longer preserved the "911 excitement". The tiger
has been so much tamed that it has become a house cat. 

On slippery roads however, once the grip of the car has 
been lost, it is almost impossible to regain control.

Has anyone experienced the car out there? If so then:

1/ Does it still retain the 911 driving excitement?
2/ How is the handling on slippery roads?

I may be completely wrong, but I wonder if the test driver
was sufficiently skilled to get a 911 to the limit and keep it
there. It sounds as though perhaps he lacked enough guts
to get the back end out in the dry, and lacked sufficient
judgement to keep it in in the wet!

I think he mentioned taking stiff turns

Subject: What videos to buy?


Dear friends: I just got the job of my life. Next term, and for as many terms
as I wish to continue doing it in the future, I teach an INTRODUCTORY
level engineering class called INTRODUCTION TO THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE.
This is a different class from the junior/senior/graduate classes in 
thermodynamics, piston engines, turbomachinery, and design, I usually teach.
It is an INTRODUCTORY class to students who are just entering university, 
and the purpose is to attract them to engineering school (even though
it doesn't pay as it used to to be an engineer).

1st day of class (I don't even introduce myself or the course, I just 
                  show two videos: 
                  Randezvous (Ferrari blasting early-morning Paris streets)
                  Faszination (RUF yellowbird in Nurbring (SP?)
2nd day of class  Introduction to the course 
                  Difference of energy and availability
                  Sources of energy, sources of availability 
                  Internal and external combustion engines 

The course continues with lectures on two-stroke and four-stroke engines,
gas turbines, their ELEMENTARY principles of operation, 
and games with my engines in the lab.

At some point I would like to show more hot videos such as the fast car through Tokyo (F40?), Porsche: The racing legend, Porsche valve adjustments, 
and other fun stuff. 

Has anyone heard of the Tokyo video? Where do I get it?
Any suggestions on what other videos I should get?

Does anyone (Air Force) have a video of a fighter plane in manoeuvers? 
(Only if you knew what these engines have to go through, you would be 
angry with the pilots that make them do it).

How do I get a WORKING 911 or 930 engine DONATED to play with in the lab for
this course?

Please reply direct to me, after I am done with it I will post the 
course outline (approximately mid January).

Thanks in advance for all your help

Theo, I think you forgot to mention:

Third day of the course (and the whole of the rest of the term): loads
of hideously difficult mathematics that will give the newbies terrible
angst and cause them to go without sleep for days at a time (only kidding)

BTW I think the Tokyo video is in fact a Paris video, people don't
violate traffic laws in Tokyo, principally because the traffic is
moving at 3KMH on average, In paris people violate traffic laws 
*because* the traffic is moving at 3KMH on average.

OK I will shut up now, read my lips, no more follow-ups.

As a general rule, coverage would be provided. Contracts vary by state 
and by insurance company. Assuming the vehicle is listed on the 
declaration page, I would crack open the policy and go immediatley to the 
exclusions section. If you see anthing there that leads you to believe 
coverage would be denied, I would ask your agent/company. If they say 
there is coverage, note the date and time you spoke to them and your home 
free.

Some years ago, "Oak" Okelshein (I probably misspelled that and he'll hunt
me for the rest of my days) did a study on this for the BMW MOA. He used
VW, Porsche, and BMW air cooled heads in his sample. Bottom line: the
problem with "valve precession" that was so dreaded in the original 
cut over from leaded to unleaded was a load of hooey. For 'murkin Veeeee-8s
it was a different matter, as the valve seats were not hardened since
they didn't *have* to be. The air cooled engines consistenly have seats
hard than a Rockwell 54, which seems to be the magic number.

So use unleaded with confidence, but probably use the high-test stuff.
I do in all my air cooled cars (and almost all my cars are air cooled).

I saw the same results in an article reprinted in the Brooklands Books 
for the 944. It had a graph showing temp and time of oil and coolant with 
and without the oil cooler. At 10 mins, the oil temp reached 80 deg C 
and stayed at around 85. It took almost 20 min without the oil cooler.
 
Anyways, on my '86 944 the needle stays at 5 bar (even at idle) for 10 
minutes until the oil has warmed up after which it begins to flutter 
around 4-4.5 at idle. I don't know if this is normal. I replaced the 
pressure sender once already as it was leaking, but it seems to be 
leaking again now. Maybe it's not on tight enough? 
 
When it's well-warmed up, the needle can drop to 3 bar at idle. Anytime 
above idle, the needle will stay at max, 5 bar. Is this common?

OK I'll byte.

Well, let's see, 914 is a better car because:

a) 914 is 3 bigger than 911, or
b) because of the more desireable mid-engine weight distribution, it must be a  
   better car, or
c) it has two less cylinders so it is lighter and more nimble, or
d) it costs less money than a 911 so it must be a better car, or
e) sitting with your butt almost on the floor gives you the illusion of driving

Nate,

I've had a '74 1.8 liter since Aug 2, 1974 (1:45pm, to be precise).
Ran for at least the first 4 years on Amoco unleaded, until the 
other brands began having unleaded, too.  Actually, I think it 
runs better on unleaded - the plugs don't foul up as much.

Just one opinion, based on a tiny sample size...

Good luck, watch out for rust under the battery tray - that's the
worst thing about 914s, I think.

Hello, Germany trip part 2

Tuesday was a National Holiday so I was unable to visit the Mercedes 
museum or the factory in Stuttgart but on Wed. morning I visited the 
Porsche Factory. The tour had around 8 people in each group,one english 
and one german speaking. It lasted around 1 1/2 hours. One gentlemen from 
the U.S showed up without a reservation for the tour but was allowed to 
attend. The tour guide made a point of saying they normally don't allow 
people without a reservation. One couple in my group was picking up a new 
Porsche. I took some notes during the tour and here is what I wrote down.

Production quantity per day 
80 of the 911  model six cylinder  cars (The  new 993 model) 
8 of the 968 model four cylinder cars
2 of the 928 model eight cylinder  cars
12 of the Audi S4 Avant (station wagon) with modified five cylinder 315 HP 
engines and Porsche brake system.(There was a nice blue one parked nearby)
12 of the 500E modified Mercedes sedans

The tour guide in his heavy German accent mentioned that Porsche has built 
over 1 million cars since the first car built in 1948. He said "If someone 
tries to sell you a Porsche older than 1948, don't buy it". He commented 
there are approximately 850 thousand Porsches still around with 600 
thousand being  driven on a daily basis. 

Porsche has recently revamped their production facility with the help of a 
japanese consultant incorporating the japanese kanban (just in time) 
system which reduced the 911 assembly time from 120 hours to around 80 
hours. The entrance to the factory has a display with a engine block, 
crankshaft, rods and pistons for the 968 , 911, and 928 with graphs 
showing the HP and Torque outputs for each engine. The guide made a point 
of boasting about how large the 4 cylinder displacement is and how the new 
engines have more HP and are more fuel efficient etc.  The 911 engine 
assembly line is U shaped with a slow moving conveyor system that moves 
the engine past many assembly stations. The moving conveyor  holds the 
engine during assembly and has two moving racks next to each engine that 
hold all the larger pieces required to assemble the engine. Previously the 
engine assembly person worked from a fixed position and had to walk back 
and forth to a parts bin and select each part. The engine assembly workers 
are rotated around to each assembly station and every worker is capably of 
assembling the complete engine from start to finish. It takes 2 hours to 
build the 4 cylinder engine, 3 hours to build the six cylinder 911 engine, 
and 4 hours to build the 8 cylinder 928 engine. They mentioned that each 
crankshaft journal is color coded and has several different size bearings 
available to blueprint the engine clearances (similar to the Honda 
engines). Each engine is tested on a dyno for a total of 32 minutes. Our 
group was able to see one of the 911 engines being tested on the dyno. The 
engine is warmed up for 20 minutes and checked for leaks or abnormal 
noises and then run at 5000 RPM to check the torque output and then raised 
to 6100 RPM to check the horsepower output. The engine is inside a small 
room and the operator works behind a glass panel and he has a large lever 
that controls the throttle.  The horsepower output must be within 2% on 
the lower range (270 horsepower nominal) or the engine is  checked to find 
the reason for the low horsepower. They indicated that the average output 
is closer to 280 HP.  They have 15 engine test beds (dynos) to handle the 
different engines they produce. It was amazing seeing so many 911, 928 and 
968 engines in various stages of assembly. The amount of $$ in that one 
area was staggering. We then headed for the final assembly area. 

The final assembly area is located in a different building and is not very 
large with two rows of 911 vehicles passing by us at chest height on 
conveyor. He pointed out the subtle differences between the U.S. versions 
and cars for Germany and other countries (center mounted brake light U.S. 
and side marker lights for Europe etc). We walked past racks of various 
vehicle parts, painted brake calipers etc. The vehicle final assembly 
process is done by a 6 person team.  The completed engine and transmission 
assembly (engine, transmission and front differential on 911 C4 vehicles) 
is installed as one unit in under 5 minutes. Porsche makes available an 
option which has buttons mounted in the steering wheel to control shifting 
with  their optional Tip-tronic semi-automatic gear box. The guide 
mentioned that Porsche allows the customer to select custom colors for  
both the interior and exterior of the car, (for an extra fee of course). 
So if you want to purchase a car that matches your wife's finger nail 
polish you can bring in a sample and Porsche will take care of the rest.  
There are over 2000 colors available with this system. It takes 2-3 days 
to paint the car, with the color spraying of the car still being done by 
hand without the aid of a robot. Only the primer and undercoating is done 
by a robot. This allows the paint to sprayed in different proportions in 
certain areas of the car that need it.  After the car is built it is test 
driven by professional drivers on public roads for 60-80 Km to ensure 
every system is working correctly. This is done all year round even when 
there is snow and ice on the roads. The tour guide pointed out that the 
911 car does 0-200 Km (~125 MPH) in 20 seconds and 200 to 0 under braking 
in 5.7 seconds. The brakes have 5 times the power output of the engine! He 
said "You must be very careful when following a Porsche on the Autobahn 
because of the superior braking system. Most Porsche drivers are 
rear-ended by cars with inferior brakes". That's all for now. Next episode 
I will describe the Audi and BMW factories.

My '77 924 did a scary thing to me the other day.  I went to put in my

fixing it and what parts do I use? Do I have to replace the whole handle? 
A friend who has an '87 VW GTI 16V with similar handle said I needed a 
new "door check pin".  Would replacing this part fix my problem, and if 
so who would have it?  I must fix it soon, its embarrasing not being able

    Dear Dr944
    
    Actually it is a fairly easy swap.  You purchase a good used 928.  
    Using a crowbar, pry the "944" emblem off of your 944.  Using copious 
    amounts of silicon and duct tape, append the emblem over the existing 
    "928" emblem.
    
    As the original 944 is now worthless, please give me a call and I will 
    have it towed off your property.  Your new 944 V8 should be good for 
    years of service.
    
    After you are finished with this project, however, you may want to see 
    someone about your "anal/rectal inversion".

Subject: 944-Coolant fan switch replacement

Hi Tom-
You may have already replaced your 87 944 fan switch, but in case you have
not, I offer a few of my experiences since I replaced mine earlier this year
(87 944S).
1.  The first problem is that there are two different fan switches for the
car -- a two wire switch and a 3 wire switch.  Unfortunately, you can't
determine which you have until you pull off the fans and shroud and pop off
the plug.  What I did was order both the 2 wire and 3 wire switches and then
return the 2 wire which I did not use.
2.  The second (minor) problem is that when you take off the fans and shroud,
you have to cut wire ties.  While this is no biggie to the pro's, you may not
have wire ties laying around which you'll need when you put it back together.
3.  Another little quirk is that the fan switch needs a deep dish style
socket to fit over the guts of it.  A regular socket won't reach down to the
flat faces of the built-in bolt.  Clearances are such that you need the
socket, as there isn't enough room to get a big wrench over the bottom of the
switch.  I got a 1 and 1/8 inch deep dissher, which I also didn't happen to
have laying around.
4.  While draining out the coolant is no problem (plastic drain plug -- be
careful not to bugger it up -- (don't forget to have the heater controls on),
refilling the cooling system and then bleeding it with the motor up to
operating temperature is a little tricky, as it is hard to get to my bleed
screw under the fuel rack.  The proceedures for filling and draining are
pretty well laid out in the owner's manual (sorry for stating the obvious --
read this quick if I'm being too elementary).
5.  I got my switches from IMPARTS, I like them and they have always been
cheap and very helpful.
Have fun.  Let me know how you made out.

Hello All

I am putting together a collection of PCNA sales literature and other

These were used by dealerships as a quick reference guide, issued each

If anyone would like to part with this kind of stuff, I would be interested.
I am not a literature dealer, I just do this as a hobby when my 951 is

Well, since you're a good guy and since you aren't likely to try to 
run this engine for the rest of your life as-is, I'll tell you. IN
general, I *PREFER* to treat every engine that I haven't personally
see run as a core, and rebuild it. But, that's not strictly necessary.

OK, here's the drill: you can't check compression because it's not
hooked up. So first you pop out the spark plugs and make sure it
turns over, then you check leak-down. If it passes that, and the
starter motor works, you can be *REASONABLY* sure that it will run
if the wiring is OK and the EFI is OK.

At that point, I'd probably bolt it up and put it in.

Once it's in the car, you can either start checking the EFI
(if you have another car with the same EFI, it's MUCH easier to
check parts by swapping them around -- ONLY try the questionable
parts in  known good car, though). Or, you can just see if it will
fire up.

Of course, check the valves, the plugs, points, and timing before doing
any of that. But you know all that stuff...

Subject: 911 transmission

I'm considering buying an '85 911 Carrera Coupe with 57,000 miles
on it.  I took it in for a buyer's inspection, and was told that the
1st and 2nd gear synchros are very weak, a $1500 repair, but that
the car is otherwise is excellent condition.  The mechanic that
did the inspection is highly thought of by the local PCA.

The owner showed me an inspection report from about 2 months
ago, by another very well-respected mechanic, that showed the
transmission to be in good shape, and claimed that all '85 Porsches
(and most other years, too) are a bit imprecise shifting into 1st or
2nd.

I'm considering getting a 3rd opinion.  In the meantime, how can I
tell a normal slight slowness/sloppiness from weak synchros?

Also, assuming that the transmission really is in good shape,
what would be a typical price for an '85 Carrera with 57K miles?
Cosmetically, the car is nearly perfect;  not Concours quality,
but about as good as daily drivers get.

Thanks,
Jim (potential future PCA member)

The right answer is YES!
All you've got to do is to be a little violent...

Actually, I'm not a guru on HOW to do it, but I happen to have read a Swedish
car-magazine (called Bilsport) in which they had a article about a Swedish
guy who had performed the operation of putting a 928 V8 in a 944 and he was
then using it for track-racing. According to the article the car was FASTER
than a 928 due to its lower weight and quicker handling.

I could try to find out the address of the magazine for you so that they could
supply you with that number of the magazine where this specific article was,
if you want to read it.

Because I'm a  optimistic who believes that almost everything can be done and 
that ordinary solutions are boring, I wish you good luck with your project!

Sure, just be careful when you lay it in the rear package area. I
don't think you can get the back glass closed, though... Not real
sure how that will help the power either... 8{)

Subject: Can I put a V8 in my 944?

I need a little more power in my 86 944.  The car is just not fast enough for
me...

Can I put a 928 motor in there?

Has anybody done it?  How much would it cost?
Would it change the handling?

Thanks, Dr.944

  I was also given the number for Jason Beam but it's his
  parents 'phone number (calls to be forwarded) so I wont list
  it here.
  
  Anyway, of all the email I received Troy Lee Designs had the
  most raves. I 'phoned them up & they were very helpful. Costs
  start at $350 & go up to over $1,100. Turn around time is
  about 10 weeks.
  
  Air Trix just had one of their (his? It might be a one-man
  band) helmets in Motorcyclist magazine & it looked great.
  Costs start at $220 & go up. Turn around time is about 3
  weeks. The helmet shown in the magazine cost about $350.
  
  After calling the above two I didn't call the others. I
  really need to come up with a design before I bother anyone
  else. The people I talked to suggested looking through
  magazines like Motorcross Action for ideas, but they'll paint
  anything like, well... Anything!
  
  Just include a detailed written description, photos from a
  magazine & color samples with your helmet to get them going.
  They'll call you when they receive the helmet & description &
  confirm what you want & give you the price.
  
  Anyway, that's what I've found out.
  
  It's probably not good for a couple of seconds at Summit
  Point though.

Hi,

according to the latest issue of Automobile magazine,
the 993 carrera 4 handles so well on dry pavement that 
it has no longer preserved the "911 excitement". The tiger
has been so much tamed that it has become a house cat. 

On slippery roads however, once the grip of the car has 
been lost, it is almost impossible to regain control.

Has anyone experienced the car out there? If so then:

1/ Does it still retain the 911 driving excitement?
2/ How is the handling on slippery roads?

I may be completely wrong, but I wonder if the test driver
was sufficiently skilled to get a 911 to the limit and keep it
there. It sounds as though perhaps he lacked enough guts
to get the back end out in the dry, and lacked sufficient
judgement to keep it in in the wet!

I think he mentioned taking stiff turns 
at 120 mph. Is that gutsy enough for you?

However, I tend also to be as sceptic as 
you about the author's judgement.

Subject: What videos to buy?


Dear friends: I just got the job of my life. Next term, and for as many terms
as I wish to continue doing it in the future, I teach an INTRODUCTORY
level engineering class called INTRODUCTION TO THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE.
This is a different class from the junior/senior/graduate classes in 
thermodynamics, piston engines, turbomachinery, and design, I usually teach.
It is an INTRODUCTORY class to students who are just entering university, 
and the purpose is to attract them to engineering school (even though
it doesn't pay as it used to to be an engineer).

1st day of class (I don't even introduce myself or the course, I just 
                  show two videos: 
                  Randezvous (Ferrari blasting early-morning Paris streets)
                  Faszination (RUF yellowbird in Nurbring (SP?)
2nd day of class  Introduction to the course 
                  Difference of energy and availability
                  Sources of energy, sources of availability 
                  Internal and external combustion engines 

The course continues with lectures on two-stroke and four-stroke engines,
gas turbines, their ELEMENTARY principles of operation, 
and games with my engines in the lab.

At some point I would like to show more hot videos such as the fast car through Tokyo (F40?), Porsche: The racing legend, Porsche valve adjustments, 
and other fun stuff. 

Has anyone heard of the Tokyo video? Where do I get it?
Any suggestions on what other videos I should get?

Does anyone (Air Force) have a video of a fighter plane in manoeuvers? 
(Only if you knew what these engines have to go through, you would be 
angry with the pilots that make them do it).

How do I get a WORKING 911 or 930 engine DONATED to play with in the lab for
this course?

Please reply direct to me, after I am done with it I will post the 
course outline (approximately mid January).

Thanks in advance for all your help

Theo, I think you forgot to mention:

Third day of the course (and the whole of the rest of the term): loads
of hideously difficult mathematics that will give the newbies terrible
angst and cause them to go without sleep for days at a time (only kidding)

BTW I think the Tokyo video is in fact a Paris video, people don't
violate traffic laws in Tokyo, principally because the traffic is
moving at 3KMH on average, In paris people violate traffic laws 
*because* the traffic is moving at 3KMH on average.

OK I will shut up now, read my lips, no more follow-ups.

As a general rule, coverage would be provided. Contracts vary by state 
and by insurance company. Assuming the vehicle is listed on the 
declaration page, I would crack open the policy and go immediatley to the 
exclusions section. If you see anthing there that leads you to believe 
coverage would be denied, I would ask your agent/company. If they say 
there is coverage, note the date and time you spoke to them and your home 
free.

    I am still considering the purchase of a '71 914/4, I have one more
question.  I was told that this engine wil run on leaded gas.  Is it OK
to use unleaded or will this cause valve problems?  I'm assuming it
would be OK as I'd hate to think all that German engineering forgot
something like the impending switchover to unleaded, but I just wanted
to make sure.  I believe the motor has never been opened up.  Sorry if
this has been answered before, but I just subscribed and I didn't see
anything on it in the FAQ.

Thanks again,

Some years ago, "Oak" Okelshein (I probably misspelled that and he'll hunt
me for the rest of my days) did a study on this for the BMW MOA. He used
VW, Porsche, and BMW air cooled heads in his sample. Bottom line: the
problem with "valve precession" that was so dreaded in the original 
cut over from leaded to unleaded was a load of hooey. For 'murkin Veeeee-8s
it was a different matter, as the valve seats were not hardened since
they didn't *have* to be. The air cooled engines consistenly have seats
hard than a Rockwell 54, which seems to be the magic number.

So use unleaded with confidence, but probably use the high-test stuff.

I saw the same results in an article reprinted in the Brooklands Books 
for the 944. It had a graph showing temp and time of oil and coolant with 
and without the oil cooler. At 10 mins, the oil temp reached 80 deg C 
and stayed at around 85. It took almost 20 min without the oil cooler.
 
Anyways, on my '86 944 the needle stays at 5 bar (even at idle) for 10 
minutes until the oil has warmed up after which it begins to flutter 
around 4-4.5 at idle. I don't know if this is normal. I replaced the 
pressure sender once already as it was leaking, but it seems to be 
leaking again now. Maybe it's not on tight enough? 
 
When it's well-warmed up, the needle can drop to 3 bar at idle. Anytime 
above idle, the needle will stay at max, 5 bar. Is this common?

OK I'll byte.

Well, let's see, 914 is a better car because:

a) 914 is 3 bigger than 911, or
b) because of the more desireable mid-engine weight distribution, it must be a  
   better car, or
c) it has two less cylinders so it is lighter and more nimble, or
d) it costs less money than a 911 so it must be a better car, or
e) sitting with your butt almost on the floor gives you the illusion of driving
   a sports car, or
f) (fill in the blank)

Huh, I must be owning the wrong car. My 911 cabriolet does not fit the bill. But  
it feels so right when I am driving it.

Nate,

I've had a '74 1.8 liter since Aug 2, 1974 (1:45pm, to be precise).
Ran for at least the first 4 years on Amoco unleaded, until the 
other brands began having unleaded, too.  Actually, I think it 
runs better on unleaded - the plugs don't foul up as much.

Just one opinion, based on a tiny sample size...

Good luck, watch out for rust under the battery tray - that's the
worst thing about 914s, I think.

Hello, Germany trip part 2

Tuesday was a National Holiday so I was unable to visit the Mercedes 
museum or the factory in Stuttgart but on Wed. morning I visited the 
Porsche Factory. The tour had around 8 people in each group,one english 
and one german speaking. It lasted around 1 1/2 hours. One gentlemen from 
the U.S showed up without a reservation for the tour but was allowed to 
attend. The tour guide made a point of saying they normally don't allow 
people without a reservation. One couple in my group was picking up a new 
Porsche. I took some notes during the tour and here is what I wrote down.

Production quantity per day 
80 of the 911  model six cylinder  cars (The  new 993 model) 
8 of the 968 model four cylinder cars
2 of the 928 model eight cylinder  cars
12 of the Audi S4 Avant (station wagon) with modified five cylinder 315 HP 
engines and Porsche brake system.(There was a nice blue one parked nearby)
12 of the 500E modified Mercedes sedans

The tour guide in his heavy German accent mentioned that Porsche has built 
over 1 million cars since the first car built in 1948. He said "If someone 
tries to sell you a Porsche older than 1948, don't buy it". He commented 
there are approximately 850 thousand Porsches still around with 600 
thousand being  driven on a daily basis. 

Porsche has recently revamped their production facility with the help of a 
japanese consultant incorporating the japanese kanban (just in time) 
system which reduced the 911 assembly time from 120 hours to around 80 
hours. The entrance to the factory has a display with a engine block, 
crankshaft, rods and pistons for the 968 , 911, and 928 with graphs 
showing the HP and Torque outputs for each engine. The guide made a point 
of boasting about how large the 4 cylinder displacement is and how the new 
engines have more HP and are more fuel efficient etc.  The 911 engine 
assembly line is U shaped with a slow moving conveyor system that moves 
the engine past many assembly stations. The moving conveyor  holds the 
engine during assembly and has two moving racks next to each engine that 
hold all the larger pieces required to assemble the engine. Previously the 
engine assembly person worked from a fixed position and had to walk back 
and forth to a parts bin and select each part. The engine assembly workers 
are rotated around to each assembly station and every worker is capably of 
assembling the complete engine from start to finish. It takes 2 hours to 
build the 4 cylinder engine, 3 hours to build the six cylinder 911 engine, 
and 4 hours to build the 8 cylinder 928 engine. They mentioned that each 
crankshaft journal is color coded and has several different size bearings 
available to blueprint the engine clearances (similar to the Honda 
engines). Each engine is tested on a dyno for a total of 32 minutes. Our 
group was able to see one of the 911 engines being tested on the dyno. The 
engine is warmed up for 20 minutes and checked for leaks or abnormal 
noises and then run at 5000 RPM to check the torque output and then raised 
to 6100 RPM to check the horsepower output. The engine is inside a small 
room and the operator works behind a glass panel and he has a large lever 
that controls the throttle.  The horsepower output must be within 2% on 
the lower range (270 horsepower nominal) or the engine is  checked to find 
the reason for the low horsepower. They indicated that the average output 
is closer to 280 HP.  They have 15 engine test beds (dynos) to handle the 
different engines they produce. It was amazing seeing so many 911, 928 and 
968 engines in various stages of assembly. The amount of $$ in that one 
area was staggering. We then headed for the final assembly area. 

The final assembly area is located in a different building and is not very 
large with two rows of 911 vehicles passing by us at chest height on 
conveyor. He pointed out the subtle differences between the U.S. versions 
and cars for Germany and other countries (center mounted brake light U.S. 
and side marker lights for Europe etc). We walked past racks of various 
vehicle parts, painted brake calipers etc. The vehicle final assembly 
process is done by a 6 person team.  The completed engine and transmission 
assembly (engine, transmission and front differential on 911 C4 vehicles) 
is installed as one unit in under 5 minutes. Porsche makes available an 
option which has buttons mounted in the steering wheel to control shifting 
with  their optional Tip-tronic semi-automatic gear box. The guide 
mentioned that Porsche allows the customer to select custom colors for  
both the interior and exterior of the car, (for an extra fee of course). 
So if you want to purchase a car that matches your wife's finger nail 
polish you can bring in a sample and Porsche will take care of the rest.  
There are over 2000 colors available with this system. It takes 2-3 days 
to paint the car, with the color spraying of the car still being done by 
hand without the aid of a robot. Only the primer and undercoating is done 
by a robot. This allows the paint to sprayed in different proportions in 
certain areas of the car that need it.  After the car is built it is test 
driven by professional drivers on public roads for 60-80 Km to ensure 
every system is working correctly. This is done all year round even when 
there is snow and ice on the roads. The tour guide pointed out that the 
911 car does 0-200 Km (~125 MPH) in 20 seconds and 200 to 0 under braking 
in 5.7 seconds. The brakes have 5 times the power output of the engine! He 
said "You must be very careful when following a Porsche on the Autobahn 
because of the superior braking system. Most Porsche drivers are 
rear-ended by cars with inferior brakes". That's all for now. Next episode 
I will describe the Audi and BMW factories.

    Dear Dr944
    
    Actually it is a fairly easy swap.  You purchase a good used 928.  
    Using a crowbar, pry the "944" emblem off of your 944.  Using copious 
    amounts of silicon and duct tape, append the emblem over the existing 
    "928" emblem.
    
    As the original 944 is now worthless, please give me a call and I will 
    have it towed off your property.  Your new 944 V8 should be good for 
    years of service.
    
    After you are finished with this project, however, you may want to see 
    someone about your "anal/rectal inversion".

Subject: 944-Coolant fan switch replacement

Hi Tom-
You may have already replaced your 87 944 fan switch, but in case you have
not, I offer a few of my experiences since I replaced mine earlier this year
(87 944S).
1.  The first problem is that there are two different fan switches for the
car -- a two wire switch and a 3 wire switch.  Unfortunately, you can't
determine which you have until you pull off the fans and shroud and pop off
the plug.  What I did was order both the 2 wire and 3 wire switches and then
return the 2 wire which I did not use.
2.  The second (minor) problem is that when you take off the fans and shroud,
you have to cut wire ties.  While this is no biggie to the pro's, you may not
have wire ties laying around which you'll need when you put it back together.
3.  Another little quirk is that the fan switch needs a deep dish style
socket to fit over the guts of it.  A regular socket won't reach down to the
flat faces of the built-in bolt.  Clearances are such that you need the
socket, as there isn't enough room to get a big wrench over the bottom of the
switch.  I got a 1 and 1/8 inch deep dissher, which I also didn't happen to
have laying around.
4.  While draining out the coolant is no problem (plastic drain plug -- be
careful not to bugger it up -- (don't forget to have the heater controls on),
refilling the cooling system and then bleeding it with the motor up to
operating temperature is a little tricky, as it is hard to get to my bleed
screw under the fuel rack.  The proceedures for filling and draining are
pretty well laid out in the owner's manual (sorry for stating the obvious --
read this quick if I'm being too elementary).
5.  I got my switches from IMPARTS, I like them and they have always been
cheap and very helpful.
Have fun.  Let me know how you made out.

Well, since you're a good guy and since you aren't likely to try to 
run this engine for the rest of your life as-is, I'll tell you. IN
general, I *PREFER* to treat every engine that I haven't personally
see run as a core, and rebuild it. But, that's not strictly necessary.

OK, here's the drill: you can't check compression because it's not
hooked up. So first you pop out the spark plugs and make sure it
turns over, then you check leak-down. If it passes that, and the
starter motor works, you can be *REASONABLY* sure that it will run
if the wiring is OK and the EFI is OK.

At that point, I'd probably bolt it up and put it in.

Once it's in the car, you can either start checking the EFI
(if you have another car with the same EFI, it's MUCH easier to
check parts by swapping them around -- ONLY try the questionable
parts in  known good car, though). Or, you can just see if it will
fire up.

Of course, check the valves, the plugs, points, and timing before doing
any of that. But you know all that stuff...

Subject: 911 transmission

I'm considering buying an '85 911 Carrera Coupe with 57,000 miles
on it.  I took it in for a buyer's inspection, and was told that the
1st and 2nd gear synchros are very weak, a $1500 repair, but that
the car is otherwise is excellent condition.  The mechanic that
did the inspection is highly thought of by the local PCA.

The owner showed me an inspection report from about 2 months
ago, by another very well-respected mechanic, that showed the
transmission to be in good shape, and claimed that all '85 Porsches
(and most other years, too) are a bit imprecise shifting into 1st or
2nd.

I'm considering getting a 3rd opinion.  In the meantime, how can I
tell a normal slight slowness/sloppiness from weak synchros?

Also, assuming that the transmission really is in good shape,
what would be a typical price for an '85 Carrera with 57K miles?
Cosmetically, the car is nearly perfect;  not Concours quality,
but about as good as daily drivers get.

Thanks,
Jim (potential future PCA member)

The right answer is YES!
All you've got to do is to be a little violent...

Actually, I'm not a guru on HOW to do it, but I happen to have read a Swedish
car-magazine (called Bilsport) in which they had a article about a Swedish
guy who had performed the operation of putting a 928 V8 in a 944 and he was
then using it for track-racing. According to the article the car was FASTER
than a 928 due to its lower weight and quicker handling.

I could try to find out the address of the magazine for you so that they could
supply you with that number of the magazine where this specific article was,
if you want to read it.

Because I'm a  optimistic who believes that almost everything can be done and 
that ordinary solutions are boring, I wish you good luck with your project!

Subject: Wheel Fans yes or no?

In  my quest to route heat away from the front brakes of my 951, I have tried
several solutions. I have used Cool Brakes for a long time and they seem to
work. They almost have to work as air is being forced right where it is
needed. 
Still I could use more cooling (or less braking) as I regularly melt off
wheel weights. 
It has been suggested that I try BBS type wheel fans. It seems to me that I
once read an article that really flamed them and said, basically, that they
were useless to the point where they actually did harm. The setup that worked
best was, in fact, Fuchs alloys.
I recently talked to the owner of HRE wheel company who also said that their
testing had proven them wheel fans useless and that mesh wheels, a la BBS
were the best bet for disipating heat.
Does anyone have any definitive data or opinions?

RE: Wheel fans helping, GTP to be specific

Yes. They work. As jerry may confirm (or Bart for that matter)  I
wasn't TOO much of a sklug in my 951, but I managed to run REPCOS
WITHOUT cool brakes without problems on an '86 -w- TS
suspensioon/brakes.

Looking at the aerodynamics of it, they pretty much have to work.

I strted burning off wheel weights seriously with them, only on the
outside, which told me they were working, and you could see al the
brake dust collecting on parts of the wheel with slow flow.

Good old centrifugal force tells the story.  Dunno about the drag
poenalty, but they do work.


You'll need the 6" offset for 8" phone dials in the front.  They also
work (though not as good) on C2-type wheels.  If you have the Club
Sport rears (Magnesium) I beleive you'll beed the 7" offset rears (All
are relative to 911 fuchs).

If you want to find out for sure you may try mine on for size.  I have
a set for the 911, whioch has the 53.3" phones you sold me on the front
due to the narrow body / 930 suspension conversion.

Subject: Re: 911 transmission

MY personal recommendation is to get a carrera -w- a G50 (86 ->)
trans.  The 915 is not as strong, but dunno whether it's woth the
addn'l $$.

On the other hand, I have a 915 which I just rebuilt, and had a local
guru look at all the parts and pop in the synchros.  First and second
are still a bit slow, as is third, but what do you want for a trans -w-
150K on it and about 40 track events!

ANyway - if you like the car my advise is to go for it and be careful
with the trans.  If you do end up needing synchros, there are prob.
other things that should be looked at so get the thing rebuilt when
needed.

Mine got taken apart just to get looked at.  $150 in synchrros,
bearings, seals and gaskets later (and $1350 for a quaife, $250 for
carrera hubs, $200 for axles and another $100 in misc) I have a trans
which, though not perfect, is quite useable.

Try driving another carrera or SC and see if you're satisfied -w- the
feel of the trans.  It may be that your expectations are too high.
911s are not exactly drag cars!

Subject: hard shifting into 2nd


I have a 77 911 that has a new (new to me at least) 3.2 engine upgrade.
During the upgrade it was determined that the synchros should be replaced.
Now, I didn't get to drive it that much before the upgrade and I haven't 
driven another 911, but it seem very difficult to shift into second gear.
I either have to be going fairly slow or leave the clutch in until the RPM
slows down before it will slide into second.  I have talked with the 
mechanic that did the work and he said that I need to "pause" when shifting
between first and second.  So, now when shifting I bring it down to neutral,
push it to the right for a split second and then shift it down.  Since,
I don't have that much experience with 911's I was wondering if this normal.
It doesn't seem right to me.  The mechanic said that he could do a slight 
adjustment that might make it easier, but didn't really recommend it.
Any suggestions?

I have some footage myself and a few friends shot of ourselves a couple of

we use piston engines - isn't that what you're after.  You'd probably

Subject: Re: Wheel Fans yes or no?

I have temperature sensors on my brake pads. With fuchs alloys, I saw a
small but measurable temperature decrease with the GTP brand plastic fans,
say 20F. With the sensors I knew when to cruise a backstraight or two to
bring the temps down. the temperature gauge setup costs ~$100 for one
wheel.
I think that you would also need some fender mounted air deflectors, to
prevent air buildup at the front edge of the fan. With the 8" fuchs up
front, the fan is sticking out in the breeze.

Since I've gone to 17" HREs, the fans are for sale...

Subject: Thanks to the list/Advice about '86 911

[LONG] 

As many of you are in the market for the first time (as I am) for a used
911, I thought I would post a summary of my recent, almost disasterous,
911 purchasing endeavors.

Some time ago I requested advice about an '87 911 Carrera Coupe which 
had had a speedometer changed, some head work done, etc.

Everyone that sent me a response told me to walk away from the car. 911's
do not need major head work at only 80,000 miles.

The used car place that I was dealing with offered to pay for a pre-purchase
inspection at the place of my choosing. Heischmans in Arlington (Alexandria?)
was recommended. They made a very good impression on me. I had the car 
taken there and checked out. It turned out the service manager there knew
the mechanic who had actually done the head work. The car checked out fine
with only some minor problems. Compression was perfect. The right front
fender did not line up with the hood correctly. There was about a 1/4
inch offset. I was assured that this wasn't that unusual. The car was 
probably scratched or dented and the previous owner just had the fender
replaced instead of repaired. "It's okay".

Something in the back of my mind said that this was not right. I took the
car to a acquaintance of mine who lives, breathes, eats and sleeps Porsches.
He examined the car carefully. It took him about 15 seconds to determine that 
the car had been in a serious accident.  (He looked in the spare tire wheel 
well and at the surrounding areas. It's supposed to look basically like flat 
metal. This looked more like cardboard that had been crumpled and straightened 
out again. He said that if a 911 has been in a front end accident it will 
"show" it in this area. He showed me an undamaged 911SC as a comparison.
He noticed that two out of three fasteners that are supposed to hold the right 
fender on were missing. The weld work was shoddy. The gas tank had a major dent 
in it. The steering rack looked damaged on the left hand side. I was told that
one of the steering control arms (wording?) was slightly bent - I don't know
what a straight one looks like, so I can't verify this. And in a number 
of places under the body one could see folds and stress marks. The same
"cardboard crumpled look" could be observed. There was a good 1/2 inch dent in 
the right wheel (Fuchs, these wheels aren't supposed to dent, are they?)) Now
the kicker, the left door was offset by 1/8" from the body. It didn't close
all the way and bounced out when you opened the door. Seems to be the whole
car was bent. This acquaintance of mine was familiar with the service manager 
and brought his competence/qualifications into question.

None of the above mentioned items were present on the pre-purchase
inspection. I walked away from the car (ran is more like it). I called the
service manager at Heischmans and told them about what I had learned about
the car they had examined for me. They brought the competence/qualifications
of my acquaintance into question but also mentioned that their pre-purchase
inspection does not include a body/frame check.  I suggested that it
probably should.

Moral #1: If you are not knowledgeable about 911's (and I am definitely not),
          there are as many radically different opinions about these cars as 
          there are people you talk to.

Moral #2: Get a number of opinions and then take take an average. If it 
          sounds in the least bit suspicious, walk away from it. There are 
          alot of these cars out there.

I almost made a $19,900 dollar mistake. Buyer beware.

Undaunted, I am continuing my quest for a Carrera. One is being sold in
Philadelphia. It's an '86 black whale-tail coupe with 80 some thousand on it. 
Single owner (private sale), all service records and has just had a 
pre-purchase inspection (which I have not yet seen.) No major engine work
has been done. The alternator has been replaced.

I understand that the '86's do not have the way cool rock-solid transmission
and hydraulic clutch that the '87's do. Are there any other differences
that I should be aware of? Anyone out there have an '86 with transmission
problems? How different are the two years? The asking price is in the high 
19's. Is this in the right ball-park?

Thanks.

PORSCHING  by Chris Welty
Hudson-Champlain Region

What follows is a recent interview I did with Santa Claus:

CW:  First of all Santa, thank you for granting me this interview
instead of Barbara Walters.   

SC:  You're welcome, you've been a good boy this year and Barbara
hasn't.

CW:  I see.  Of course that could be because she's not a boy.

SC:  ho ho ho.  Hurry up because I've got Larry King at 11.

CW:  Right, well, my first question concerns your name.  It has always
been a source of confusion for me. "Santa Claus" sounds Spanish, but I
happen to know you are German. 

SC: Ho ho ho. Don't feel bad, many people are confused by my name. I
am actually Saint Nicholas, and I am from a region of western Turkey
called Lycia. I became famous during the height of the Roman Empire. I
was known for my generosity, and most particularly for saving young
girls from lives of prostitution. My fame spread quickly through the
Empire (which is most of modern day Europe) when I was canonized, and
was made the patron saint of children.

CW: But I thought you were German.

SC: Ho ho ho. Many Americans associate me with Germanic cultures
because I was brought into this country by the Dutch, in whose
language my name is pronounced, "Sint Niklaas". The dutch language has
a very rhythmic quality, and the English speaking Americans thought
they were hearing "Santa Claus." That is where my name comes from in
your country.

CW: If I understand you correctly, you're trying to tell me you're not
German.

SC: Not in the least, no ho ho. In fact, my association with Christmas
is equally accidental. Saint Nicholas Day is actually December 6th,
and the tradition on that day was for someone to dress up as me (I
used to wear a red robe lined with white fur due to my station as a
bishop of the Catholic Church) and give gifts to children. After the
protestant reformation, most Europeans decided they didn't want to
give up this holiday, so it was merged with the pagan winter festival
which had already become Christmas.

CW: This is going to cause a bit of confusion. Why would I interview
you for a magazine dedicated to German cars if you're not German? 

SC: Well I ho ho hown a Porsche, if that helps. In fact, the
designation "SC" on the 78 through 83 911 stands for "Santa Claus." I
have a white 78 SC coupe, and I'm having the elves prepare a 73 RS for
Club Racing.

CW: That's a bit of a stretch - what about Kris Kringle? Is he German?

SC: Ho ho ho. I suppose he is, in a way. You see, Kris Kringle is
another Anglicized Dutch word. The Christmas celebration revolves
around the "little Christ Child," which in Dutch is, "Christkindle."
Americans heard this as, "Kris Kringle." By that time I was already
associated with Christmas and so the name became associated with me.

CW: Well that's just great. Isn't there anything German about you?

SC: I have a summer cottage in Heidelberg. Ho ho ho.

CW: Bingo! That's the connection we'll use. By the way, a few more
sessions on the "stairmaster" wouldn't hurt there Nick. 

SC:  Ho ho ho.  Tell me how to keep fit after you've lived two
thousand years. 

CW:  Two thousand...wow.  That first thousand must have gone pretty
slow without Porsches. 

SC:  Ho ho huh?

CW:  OK, that's a wrap.  Thanks again Santa, and don't forget those
"S" piston/cylinders I ordered for Christmas.

SC:  Ho ho ho.  If we're done then please get off my lap.

I remember reading a few years back (Consumer Reports or one of the car 
mags) that all gas companies adjust the blend of their gas not only for the 
climate, but also for the altitude where it will be sold.  I suppose it's 
reasonable that Denver's gas needs would be different than those in LA or 
Manhattan at sea level.

Buying from a high volume gas station is probably the best way of getting a 
current blend to go with the current weather.

Hi, Stan.
 
I'll corroborate all that about no valve recession on unleaded gas. When the
stuff first came out in Europe, there was some concern on the part of a
Porsche client that it would hammer the valves and/or seats to death. I ran
a prototype engine for I think 200 hours on the dyno, at full load, on
unleaded regular, to measure recession of the seats and wear of the valves.
Bottom line, there wasn't any.

My insurance agent claims that one of his clients had a 911 taken from him
at gunpoint a few years ago, the day before Christmas. He was just pulling
out of the Porsche dealer's service facility on Pacific Coast Highway in
Newport Beach. It was the day before Christmas. Owner said "OK, take the
car, but I have my briefcase in the back with papers in it." Thief said take
the damn briefcase, I just want the car. Owner gets out, takes briefcase,
thief gets in car, owner opens briefcase, pulls out a pistol and shoots
thief dead.
 
Police responds to all this. Cop takes notes, asks owner if he didn't feel
that his action might have been a little extreme. "Nope." Owner was not
charged with anything.
 
I wonder if the Porsche owner can sue the thief's estate for cleaning up the
inside of the car? (In New York they call that "chutzpah.")
 
As my insurance agent puts it, the death penalty is a proven deterrent. This
guy had been arrested for grand theft auto several times in the past, but he
is never gonna do it again.
 
I suppose the rationale is that what he did counts as assault with a deadly
weapon, to which the owner was allowed to respond with deadly force.

    First of all, thank you guys very much for helping me out with all
the info on 914's.  I have a few more questions still... it looks like I
am going to buy the car I was looking at, it's a '71 914/4.  Can anyone
recommend a good book/manual on replacing body panels on this car?  It
need a new hood, driver's side door, and driver's side front and rear
fenders.  The panels are included with the car (except the door) but I
have been told that all the fenders (even the front) are welded on, not
bolted on.  Is this true?   If so, I'm going to need some help in making
sure I have everything aligned properly before I fire up the welder, as
I really don't want to screw this up.
    A few questions about the motor, as well - it's the original FI 1.7,
is there anything I should know about it?  I'd like it to last as long
as possible before a rebuild, how high should I rev it?  Is there a
lower rev limit (don't let it drop below xxxx?)  This is very important,
as my mom will probably end up driving this car occasionally, and she
seems to think there's a tax on RPM's... ;)  Also, how
difficult/expensive would it be to put a newer transaxle in this car, so
I could have the benefits of light body weight and a slick-shifting
tranny at the same time?
    And does anybody have a '71 front bumper they want to sell, or know
somewhere I could get one cheap?  The car comes with the newer black
5mph bumper, and I think it's ugly (and hopefully unnecessary.)

thanks yet again,

My understanding is MTBE releases O2 gas when it is burned thus
providing more complete combustion in situ and pollution is
significantly reduced. I DO NOT know this to be a fact though.
Alternately the MTBE could make O2 from the atmosphere more soluble in
the fuel (which I doubt).


Fuel can contain MTBE to reduce emmisiions and at the same time be
supplimented with ethanol to reduce the amount of crude oil refined to
make a gallon of gasoline. I do not think gas supplimented with ethanol
alone is considered to be an oxygenated fuel. The government encourages
the production of fuel supplimented with ethanol for at least two
reasons 1) the money leaving the US to purchase crude oil is reduced 2)
surplus grain stocks are reduced and the agricultural economy of the
country becomes stronger (supply and demand again).

Brilliant. What "existing 928 emblem" are you talking about? Thru 1986
there was no external label proclaiming the car to be a 928. Only a Porsche
badge on the hood and the wheel centers, and "Porsche" embossed in the rear

bumber. An excellent example of understatement and good taste, IMHO. Unlike
some other examples we might think of.

The "15 years ago" section in the latest Road & Track sparked memories:
Someone took an A1 Golf body and stretched it over a 928 chassis back in 
1979 or 1980. A stealth 928 tickles my fancy more than a V8 in a 944.

   Being the proud owner of a derelict 924, I'd mused about something
 like this too (eg, put a FWD Cadillac transaxle/V8 in the back...)

  The problem with any such swap in the front is a low hood line and
 narrow shock towers. There was an outfit putting 3.8liter V6s into
 924/944, it involves relocating the brake master cylinder. I think there
 is plenty of room from front to back.
  If you haven't tried to get the heads off a 928 engine in a 928 chassis,
 you won't really understand how really -wide- that motor is already.
 I'd heard years ago about someone building the 928 drivetrain into
 a VW Golf, supposedly he widened the car by splitting it down the
 middle (and I suppose Lexan for the windshields).

   (For trivia purposes...the 4-cylinder AMC Gremilin used a 924 motor.
 But swapping the engines of those isn't trivial; the low hoodline of
 the 924 requires the engine to be installed at a diagonal, so the
 carbureted intake of the Gremlin will stick out. That also explains
 the rather beautiful casting Porsche used for the oil pan....)

   Of course, you're probably much better off buying a Corvair with
 a mid-engined 327...but if you need cubic inches I've got a 534 c.i.
 ford motor I'll sell you cheap...and the 924 to practice on...and....

Steve,
Thanks for the answer. I am willing to place a small bet that if you run with

them to be ineffective.
It would be an interesting experiment. I did that once with cool brakes and
they made a HUGE difference. Of course there was absolutely no air coming to

And no, you are certainly no slug. I am also sure that Summit is faster

Subject: 911: What would you do?

I have a situation similar to Alex Noodergraaf's: engine said to be working,
but not seen running, before purchase.  My fingers are still tightly crossed,
but I THINK I got away with it:  it runs well when the throttle is open.  "It"
is a 2.7 liter, temporarily using the Zeniths from the 2.2 that preceded it,
in a Vanagon.

At idle or trailing throttle, however, it needs help.  And so do I:
What is the vacuum line on a 2.7 distributor -- advance or retard?  Should I
use it with carbs, and if so from above or below the butterflies?  Should I
put the 2.2's (Marelli) distributor on as long as I use the Zeniths?  Is it
foolish to even attempt this Zenith-on-2.7 approach?  I'm just trying to have
a working van during the weeks or months it will take to assemble and test all
the FI parts.  If the engine were hot or pingy under load I wouldn't even pur-
sue using the carbs, but it sounds and feels great as long as my foot is on
the pedal.  Your advice (and tolerance of my many transgressions against The

Nice touch. Anyway the next day when I got in the car

the car smelled, stank actually, like airplane glue!
Now in another time, two hits for the price of one would

Subject:       Ethanol in Gasoline, again...

Another chemist jumps into the fray . . .

Ethanol (or another oxygenated compound)  is added to gasoline for 
several reasons.  The stated purpose is to reduce emissions of 
incompletely burned hydrocarbons.  This occurs because the oxygen in
ethanol (CH3CH2OH, part of the molecule, not dissolved in solution) 
is available to combine with various half-combusted hydrocarbons to 
form CO2.

This is, again, the stated purpose.  Ethanol in gasoline does reduce
emissions of nasties; however, that is not the only reason (maybe not
even the major one) it is there.  Other compounds could concievably 
have been just as good, or maybe even better.

Ethanol is in your gasoline because corn growers and ethanol 
producers (along with farm state congressmen) convinced the EPA and 
everyone else that ethanol in gasoline is a great idea.

Oxygenated gasoline is probably a good idea whose time has come, but 
ethanol as the oxygenate is a political issue as much as, or more 
than, a scientific one.

Ah, but it will inprove the 944's weight bias from the anemic 50/50 to 
a studly, red-blooded 33/67.

Personally, I'd leave the 944 engine in place and *add* a 911 engine to the
transaxle.  This way you maintain the correct (33/67) weight distribution 
and lower the C.G.

This can be done by replacing the rear transmission cover on the 944 with
bell housing adaptor [part # 951.911.50.50.2.33.67].

This was done by the factory for the 955 group B rally car.  Alas, they ran 
afoul of the sanctioning bodies (yet again) and the project was scrapped.

I am puzzled by his statements.

Those who hate chemistry should delete this message now! To them I
apologize for wasting their disk space.




The complete combustion of ethanol is decribed by:


		     spark, pressure
CH3-CH2-O-H + 3 O2   ------------> 2 CO2  + 3 H-O-H + energy
                      (excess O2)

Note in this simplest (Ocam's razor) explanation of alcohol combustion
chemistry the O atom in ethanol never produces molecular oxygen (O2
gas). In fact one can also write:

:OH(-) + H(+) -----------> H2O

This means the -OH of the alcohol can form water directly without
invoking the production of O2.

There is nothing to encourage the OH in ethanol to react further with
something else to produce an oxygen radical which would then have to
quickly encounter another atomic oxygen radical and form an oxygen
molecule. Oxygen radicals are extremely reacive and would be much more
likely to react with something else first.

Of course, in an engine the combustion is much more complicated.
Combustion is incomplete. N2 gas is present (this is where the NOx
emissions come from) and who knows what else happens when incomplete
combustion products react with other species present in the cylinder.
So... my analysis of this business could be much too simple.

But, I see no reason to assume ethanol alone oxygenates gasoline.
However I'm sure someone elsewhere on the Net (such as a gasoline
company chemist or EPA chemist) could clear this up for once and for
all.

Let's get back to Porsche discussions which I (and I'm sure everybody
else) find much more interesting.

First, what a great job!!  I would highly recommend Ted to anyone

so other rush jobs jumped in front of me.

Second, Ted uses a special ~$800.00 tool to measure the finished i.d.

shops get, according to him.

Last night, as I inserted the shiney new valve into the snug guide,

you can't shoot an escaping criminal.

Subject: Air/Fuel ratio meter (Lambda) and Solex problems


Hi all who has Solex and PROBLEMS.

Having many problems with Solex PII-40 and type 106 cam,
I at last decide to buy 2 lambda-meters made by CRT. 

With the lambda-meter, I got exact info how rich/lean my engine
was runnign in every RPM range (meter has 4 number display).

Here are results when accelerating with standard jets:

	mixture tube:	8
	Main jet	X1.25
	Air jet		180
	iddle jet	G55

	1000 -> 4000 rpm, lambda 0.830 -> 0.800 ! too rich
	4000 -> 4500 rpm, lambda 0.800 -> 0.780 !!! too rich, problems
	4500 -> 7500 rpm, lambda 0.780 -> 0.980 !! too lean

Theoretically, 0.900 is best for performance, but little more fuel
helps to keep engine colder.

I think that optimun value is near 0.850 -> 0.870 for my engine.
This gives best performance and power, and gives little extra fuel
to avoid pistons burning (melt).

So. If you have Solex and you have promlems when accelerating,
try modify yours carps so, that you can add weight to ball valves
inside the carps. Don't remove power circuit, or the engine runs
too lean in high RPM range. Adding weight to ball valves reduces
fuel flow from accelerating nozzle in lower rpm range. I have not tested
how changing acc. pump nozzle helps, because I can't find any nozzles for Solex
from Finland. Also change jettings.
I have now next jetting:

	mixture tube:	8
	Main jet:	1.20
	air jet		1.60
	iddle jet	G53

This works fine, even between 4000 -> 4500 rpm it is still little more too
rich when accelerating.

The lambda-meter helps a lot when tuning carps or injection
systems, so I can recommend such meter to everybody. The meter is also
cheap compared with melted pistons.
In Finland the meter cost 600 FIM (130$) and oxygen sensor 380 FIM (80$).

If you like to have more info from the lambda-meter, contact to

a guy who was trying to steal his Toyota.  He was not some well connected
guy, but rather some poor sod who was just barely scraping by.

All things considered, out here in the Wild West, you have a very good argument
for using deadly force.  I'm not promoting it, we just have to realise that
sh*t happens.  And I don't feel sorry for the SOBs that get their heads blown
off by people the are robbing, and I probably wouldn't feel bad abuot doing

from a proposed high-speed lane:
I can't get behind this at all.  Why permit a 55mph-competent driver in a high
speed lane just because he has a 160mph-competent car?  And why prohibit a 
well-maintained example from the 85mph years, or an appropriately modified
mini-van.  I DO like the long-discussed, elitist idea of a Master Driver's
license, which slides into a pocket on the rear window and identifies the
driver as having passed rigorous tests and permits him/her to exceed the

In Nevada, I believe it is legal to defend one's person/property by using
force, even deadly force if necessary.  

For instance, if an intruder enters your house, it is completely
withing legal bounds to open fire, provided that the intruder is not
making an attempt at exiting the residence (ie., don't shoot him/her
in the back).

	Yes and no, in Texas anyway.  It just so happens that there was a
TV News special on about a month ago in the Austin area about this.  I
didn't catch the beginning of this thread, but I'll put in my opinion on
just the general stuff (gotta love these technical terms!).  I also called
the police department to get a clarification because of a disagreement in
our household about the same thing.

	What they said was that you can *only* use deadly force if they show
intent to hurt or kill you - not just for entering your house or taking 
property.  An example was shown where this person was stealing a Bronco
(thank God not the Porsche, huh?) and the homeowner shot and killed him.  
The homeowner ended up getting in hot water over this.  I don't necessarily
agree with the ruling on this, but it was the law.

Well, down here in San Diego, the laws on the books say you can use
the force to keep your property.  Also, in the case that Peter's agent
cited, the SOB that lost his head pulled a gun first.  I would think
at that point he had showen the intent to hurt or kill the guy with
the Porsche and earned what he got.  Like it was pointed out earlier,
it's all too common out here in California to loose one's life even if
you are giving up/have given up your car.

Now, this might seem extream, but there have been too many people here
that have lost loved ones for no reason, and I've had a gun drawn on
me while stopped in my 944.  If more of these people expected to get
shot back at, this wouldn't happen nearly as much.  (When was the last 
time some madman tried to shoot-up everyone at a trap/target range?)

Subject: Ethanol in gasoline, yet again

 
Hi, Bill.
 
Combustion isn't the simple balance-both-sides-of-reaction process one might
expect. There are a lot of things going on in there (combustion engineers
often just do a copout and lump all these under the "------->" part
of the reaction). There is partial dissociation of the fuel, and there are
preflame reactions and possibly cracking which produce the compounds which
actually burn. For gasoline, 2,2,4 trimethylpentane or octane (both C8H18)
isn't what actually gets burned. By the time the mixture lights off, it has to
some extent turned into other stuff. Lichty (see below) says that some of the
stuff going on before isooctane lights off includes formation of higher
aldehydes and ketones, formaldehyde, olefins or unsaturates, hydrogen peroxide,
and organic peroxides. You probably know more about all these things than I do;
I'm just quoting the book. (All this just reminds me of that that steenking
Organic lab I had to take).
 
I don't want to think about it any more. If I did, I'd feel obligated to get
a Ph.D. out of it.

bad shape. The car hasn't really been driven in ten years. That's all I know.
The lady who had it said that it belonged to her brother in law and that she

	Well, its not uncommon for thieves to raise the hood, you know,
like to clip speaker wires so the damned alarm will quit :-)

	Removing the battery emntirely and storing it in your apartment
would be slightly more effective. This can be a bad idea if it is
leaking. Especially if its leaking H2 and you put it in a closed container
and then light a match.

Folks,

Was looking at a G50 transmission at the shop these evening.  A
customer bought it for short money as a spare.  I haven't seen the
inside of too many G50's, since they're new, strong, and folks
don't seem to break them too often.

This one had something I don't recall having seen before.  The
3rd and 4th gears' dog gears were depopulated of perhaps two
thirds of their teeth.  Not because they were destroyed, but
seemingly because that's the way they were made.

Does anyone know when and why the factory started making them this
way?  Best guess as to why is easier engagement, but I dunno.

Oh, what the heck, come on over!  IMO, though, crime is the #1
problem in the US.  Things are out of control here.  I travel to 
central Florida on business quite a bit and it is always interesting to read
the instructions the rental car company gives you about driving
a rental in the state of Florida.  Things like : "always know where you are
going before leaving the rental agency" or "never stop and ask directions" or
"if someone rear-ends you, don't get out of your car" -
they (the criminals) have this neat little trick of bumping the rear of your

Subject: Hard shifting into 2nd, 915 box

Gregg Jensen asked about 915 trannys problem shifting into 2nd gear, if it
was normal. You should NOT have to pause when shifting into second.

I have seen this problem on an '86 that I co-drove in '91 solo competition.
The problem was the shifter was adjusted so that 2nd gear was too close to
the right front corner of the driver's seat. It can be easily adjusted by
putting the car into second gear, then removing the rear access cover behind
the front seats, and slightly loosening the connector screw. Move the shift
lever slightly away from the seat to where you think 2nd gear should be. Then
re-tighten the screw. Check the adjustment, make sure that you can still get
all other gears OK and your hand doesn't hit the dashboard when the shifter
is in 1st, 3rd, or 5th gears. You may have to adjust it a few times.

Subject: Reformulated gas

Bruce's excellent article on Alcohol vs. MTBE from 9/91 Pano is
reprinted in Up-Fixin #9 page 87. A summary follows:

MTBE: OK
Alcohol: BAD

But seriously, he does say that Gasahol can loosen up any dirt, scale,
or rust in your tank and carry it to your Fuel Injection system. I've
also heard that Ethanol dries out the rubber seals in the FI, requiring
expensive repairs.

Bruce's article concludes with:
"Like the catalytic converters, MTBE is another solution to ecological
needs that we can live with and, ..., does not have any real downside."

Subject: 911 mystery number

While replacing the dash and putting some interior trim pieces back in 
my 1972 911T I came across an additional stamped in number.

The number is on the right side dash sheetmetal next to the ashtray.

The USA passenger side (right side) knee pad must be removed to see it.

Anyway the number was
   
   112 4238

When I replaced the dash, a two day experience in itself, 
I saw the same number was hand written on top of the under-dash sheetmetal.

Is it some sort of option/interior code?  

The VIN number of the car is 911 211 1483, and the mystery number
seems related only by shifting digits around.

I can see no evidence that the dash sheet metal was spliced onto the
car, so I'm assuming it is factory stock.

Any information out there?

possibly to aid in tuning, especially if I "chip" it.

I would like to install the probe in the hole where the tune-up
pipe comes off of the exhaust collector on its way to the turbo.

I will have to remove the crossover pipe as I removed the tune-up
pipe and the probe would not go in due to (apparently) something in the hole  
to prevent stuff from falling into the pipe.

A) Has anyone done anything like this, and B) what has to come off to get the  
crossover pipe off on the turbo side?

Hello Lon,

Yours is the second post I have seen that talks about having to remove
the fan assembly to get at this switch.  The factory manual also says
to do this.  However, when I replaced the switch on my 951, I found
that it was entirely unnecessary to mess with the fans at all if you
use a deep 1-1/8" socket, as you also mentioned.  Is there something
different about the S models that makes the fan assembly removal
essential?

Some time trialers in this area have told me that insurance companies
will pay *once*, and then place a rider on the policy to remove any
future liability.  I was a bit surprised to hear this, since I had
always assumed that claims of this type would surely result in policy
cancellation (using, for example, the "significant increase in the
hazard we insure against" clause in my Allstate policy).  Anyone
else heard of this?

Personally, I would not track a car that I could not insure myself
(for the value of the car, personal injury liability being another
matter) or have the emotional stamina to just "write off" without a
replacement.

Regarding your claim that 944's & 914 aren't Porsches, what is a Porsche 
in your definition?  The original Porsche, the 356, was a sports car that 
at least in its early years utilized VW parts, and it is this car that 
defines true Porsche to me; it came from the hands of the Doctor himself. 
The 914, 924 (which I am proud to own), and 944 followed this mold in 
utilizing some, though less than you might expect, VW parts.  I cringe 
when I hear 911 owners claim theirs is the only true Porsche, when our 
cars actually fit the mold better than the 911. I love 911's to death, 
but my budget only allows me to drive a "real" Porsche. If anyone

Regarding the recent comments as to 944s, 914s, I have no experience with 914s, because I'm too tall, however:

I currently drive a 911SC, mainlky on the track.  I put mYBE 3K miles
on it on the street.  My last car before my last 911 was a 951, '86
with upgrade to approximately 951S ( a bit stiffer but otherwise same
suspension, 280HPish).

I can say I miss the 951.  As a matter of fact I miss my '84 944.
If I had to drive one car all the time it would DEFINATELY be an '89
951 (since I can't afford a 993).  It had ROOM, POWER and it stopped.

Unfortunately it was murder on tires and brake pads, which accounts for
my change to 911.

An 89 951, properly setup and left more or less stock will almost keep
up with my 911 SC 3.4, which has 930 suspension and a very happy motor,
along with RSR struts, and the rest of the happy suspension stuff (see
my home page if you care, I imagnine you won't).  The bottom line is
that my 911 has no heat, no A/C, is loud as hell, leaks, and has no stereo.
It's only marginally better on the track than my 951 which was quiet,
had an ecxcellent ride, was roomy, and got 27mpg on a trip, compared to
13.5 for the 911.

Whoever wrote the note about the 944 must not be a PCA member.  If he (she)

owner, a loudmouthed braggard with a need to make up for his anotomical
inadequacies.  Unless, of course, it was a woman, in which case I won't

Subject: Leaking 944 clutch hydraulic hose


I've just noticed that the hydraulic hose between the clutch master
cylinder and the slave cylinder is leaking. I think the leak is at the
pressed connection where the thin pipe from the slave cylinder joins the
rubber hose. I wonder if this is common on 944's? 
 
Unless I missed it, the part is not in the Automotion, Tweeks or
Performance Parts catalogs. Can anyone suggest where I can locate this
hose? 
 
In the past I've seen some posts indicating that it might be 'tricky'
bleeding the slave cylinder (or was it clutch master?). I assume all you
do is open the bleeder screw on the end and pump the clutch pedal. 
 
As for installation of the new hose, is there a trick? It seems straight
forward. I assume you unsrew one end at the fitting near the firewall and
undo the other end at the slave. Maybe to keep things clean, plug the
loose end at the firewall with the rubber plug from the slave until the
new hose is in place? 
 
Any tips or advice would be appreciated.
Thanks

but now we have a thread started by George Hussey about what Porsche is best.
The latest post is some yahoo calling everyone who doesn't agree with him "a

Subject: 914 brake light, part 2

First, thanks for the advice on the fixing of the 914 brake light in the 
dash. 

I'm partway there but need more help: I took the dash out yesterday and
inspected the light in the socket and the diode, etc. Bulb looked good,
but I put in a spare just in case. (that wasn't it.) Poked around a bit,
cleaned up the inside of the socket where the bulb attaches, nothing
happened - no light on. Started to put the voltmeter on it and -- wow --
the light came on blinking... and it worked all day and yesterday night. 
(I was going to inspect the master cylinder wires next.)

This morning -- you guessed it -- it wasn't working again. I poked some 
more -- I only had 5 minutes or so today -- still didn't work. Then 
tonight it did again. I'm confused. Could it be the socket? (it's the 
part the the bulb goes into...back of it has three wires attached) What 
about the diode ? How do I test it? (I assume it is there for the blink 
action, is this right?)

Car is running great otherwise. I had it out on some back country roads 
today near Colts Neck NJ, pretty country, what fun!! After my day of 
"driver education" at Lime Rock last month, I had to be really careful to 
not get a killer ticket today. And with the new injectors and the oil 
leak seemingly gone (no oil lost in last 500 miles) and heat too, car is 
great.

Subject: Re: Leaking 944 clutch hydraulic hose

Chris,

Yes, it is common for this part to leak.  The hose is actually
two parts, a rigid line and a flexible hose.  However, it is often
sold as a single part.  For an '86 944 eight-valver aspiro, the
rigid line is 951.423.091.11, and the hose is 951.423.189.01.
While you are in there, you should inspect and consider replacing
the blue feed hose from the reservoir to the clutch MC, which is
available by the meter as 999.181.021.50.  Check it for abrasion
and rot.

By all reports, working on the clutch hydraulics is a pain.  Access
is a little tight.  You also need to be careful about getting air
out of the lines, and I wouldn't do the job myself without some
sort of postive-pressure bleeder like the Eezi-Bleed.

When you say that you replaced all the seals, does this mean that
you rebuilt the callipers?  If not, and if the rotor/hub is frozen
because the pads won't retract, a rebuild is in order.

I live in California. I have been here for nearly 8 years. Before that, I
lived in Weissach, Germany. (Yes, that Weissach). Itty bitty town, maybe
2000 inhabitants, out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by farm country
and woods, nearest big town (Leonberg) 10 miles away, Stuttgart another 10
beyond that. In 8 years of living in California, I have never been a victim
of any crime. I have accidentally left my garage door wide open all night.
Nothing walked away. The only thing that comes close was two 14 year olds on
a moped losing control, bouncing over a curb and crashing into a
friend's Saab Sonnett parked in my driveway. There were tire marks on the
hood, a bent bike and a couple of addled juvenies wandering around. Kids were
still there when police and parents came, and the Saab needed crashing anyway.
 
By comparison, in my 3.5 years in Weissach, my various 911s were broken into
twice to steal the radio (why anybody would steal a Blaupunkt is still a
mystery to me), once the left outside mirror was stolen, and as soon as that
was replaced (and I paid the deductible) the other side was stolen. I'm told
model airplane builders like the servo motors. But the best incident was
one morning when I came out of the house and found the ass end of the car 2
feet off the ground, with a cheap imported floor jack still under the
tranny. They tried to take the engine, and left in the middle of the job for
some unknown reason. The next night they hit the local gas station owner's
son's Turbo, but these guys were real geniuses, the car fell off the jack in
the process. Once a bus driver was blasting along my quiet, residential,
non-thoroughfare street, in one of those huge German tour buses, to visit
his girlfriend in a driving snowstorm. I had a new 911 with less than 1000
km on it, and took the old GTI that day because it was snowing. Bus driver
drove right over the left rear fender. Car was damn near totaled, just my
luck it wasn't and they fixed it (heck we only kept them for a year as
employees anyway), and I made about $60 a day for 6 weeks in loss of use.
(OK, so that isn't a crime, but it's still an annoying incident).
 
And once in Strasbourg, parked in front of a friend's house, my 911 was
broken into and a briefcase stolen. Again amateurs, they hit the horn button
by accident so they never had time to finish hotwiring the ignition.
Briefcase was found a few minutes later by a very efficient gendarmerie
which apparently has experience in these things.
 
So don't anybody tell me that Europe is safer or has less crime than the
U.S. in general or California in particular. That particular item of bullshit
is propagated by a Eurosocialist press which has a definite anti-American bias.
Yes, there are parts of Los Angeles where it is not safe to drive a Porsche
or to be of a particular ethnic group. I can show you the same sorts of
areas in many European cities.

Subject: 911 mystery number

 
Hi, John.
 
I don't know for sure, it may be some encrypted version of your serial
number, but that's unlikely. A more likely explanation is that it is the
work order number for your car. That would make sense, if numbers are
hand-written on items so that they go into the right job number, like the
dash you mention.
 
If it really is the work order number, there is no way to find out short of
having somebody inside the right department at the factory look it up in a
hand-written book which links work order number, chassis number, engine and
trans number as the cars are built. This number is not recorded on the
famous "Kardex."

Subject: "RS Spec" 911e for sale

I saw this ad in the newspaper and decided to call to get some information;
basically who services his car (I  call because I want to hear the owners'
experiences with local mechanics as I'm not sure who I want to trust with my
car) and if he has any spare parts that would be willing to sell apart from
the car:

'71 911E, 5 spd, A/C, very clean, new paint, 12k, (305) 247-0221 
South Florida

As it turns out, he says the that the previous owner converted it to RS spec,
i.e. ducktail and wide flares in the back. He didn't know much else about it
and didn't seem to care that much about it. He traded his '61 Vette for the
car. He  _says_ that he selling the car because he is tired of it and that it
doesn't accelerate as fast as his old Vette or other muscle cars. If anybody
is interested in buying it give they guy a call and if it sounds good I can
take a look at it and givve you my impression (he says that there is no
rust). 

Standard disclaimer applies. I don't know the guy, I just called him after
seeing the ad in the paper. If you need my help just E-mail me.

Subject: early 911 front hood latch, synth. oil

Hi, 

Can anybody give me some pointers on how wto keep my trunk closed. I just
installed new hood seals  and now my hood will open up after about 5 minutes
of driving, or whenever the car flexes too much. I didn't have that problem
earlier but then again the seals didn't  keep much water out of my trunk
either. 

Thanks to all those who responded to my synthetic oil question. After some
thought I'm going to give Mobil 1 20W/50 a try.  I thought about Syntec 5W/50
but I don't need the cold protection that it offers. As for the high end
oils, Swepco, Redline, Amsoil, they aren't readily available at the corner
store and if I ever should need some away from home, read road trip, then it
would be a major hassle to try to find some.

Hmm... I don't recall seeing the words "Volkswagen" on the 944 ... but hey
somebody must have screwed up when  they put "Porsche" on the back of the
car.

The 944 isn't a *real* Porsche ???    -----    **NOT**

I'm sorry you seem to have an elitist attitude about the 944. If you had
just said that the 944 was ok, but you prefer the 911, then that would be
tolerable. I realize that the 944 has always been less expensive than the
911, but it subscribes to a different audience. I own a 944 and I love it.
If I had $12k to spend on a car right now, two of my possible choices would
be:

                1) a 911sc (if I looked hard enough for a good example ...)
                2) a later model 944 turbo

I would go with the 951 personally, but that's just my opinion. In my
position, I need a car that is reliable, and I feel that for "x" amount of
money, a person can buy a much newer 944 than 911, and therefore have a
more trouble free car. If I did not depend on my 944 everyday, then I might
consider the 911. The point is, the 944 is what fills my needs, wants, and
financial situation. Because I own a 944, I don't go around slamming the
911 and it's owners saying, "All the people who own 911's are rich
a--holes", because I know that's not true. So hey, don't slam the 944 (or
the 914). It was designed and built by the same people, and I'll bet the
folks at Porsche treat all the cars they've ever built the same ...

You seem to know a lot about the 944 (NOT), so hey, the next time I need
advice on how to replace a clutch, or rebuild a tranny, or set an
alignment, I'll ask you ... because hey, if you can slam the 944 like that,
you must be all knowledgeable about it, right ???

You know, I'm really tempted to slam the 911 (like in reference to 2.7l
engines and pulled studs, or simply referring to 911's as "Weekend
warriors", which is what a friend of mine, a Porsche mechanic, refers to
911's as ...), but that's not the kind of guy I am, so I'll just slam you
(you either own a 911 or want one real bad). All I can say is that the
Porsche mechanic I'm friends with could probably afford any 911 he wanted,
but he owns two 944s ...

I hope I bump into you at a track sometime, we can see who turns that
fastest times ...

Look, LET THIS DROP NOW!!!! Or I'll ditch the lot of you! This is
the sort of mindless drivel that you see on Usenet netnews all the
time and is NOT tolerated here. That's why this is run as a private
members-only list, to keep out the riff-raff and make it possible to
get REAL answers to REAL questions in REAL time.

*ALL* of the Porsches with the exception of the 911 were either "parts
cars" taking heavily from the VW/Audi parts bins, or originally
designed for someone else (like the 9*4s which should have been Audi
GT Coupes if Audi hadn't backed down, and the 928 which should have
been a Mercedes). *ALL* of them. Does that make them any less -- or MORE --
Porsche than any of the other cars? OF COURSE NOT!

So go into the garage and hug your car and be nice to the other Porsches
you see out there. And let's get back to discussing MEANINGFUL things.

Subject: Protecting one's assets?

Hi,

As we're into discussing thefts/politics/crimes and how to avoid these, I'd 
might as well throw in my 0.02 kroner.

Because most Europeans set the values of human life *WAY* over such trivias 
as cars, stereos and whatever goods a thief would love to steal, we will not 
kill to protect these items either. I would like to think this is the common 
sense in the US too, how many of you guys/girls would *really* put a slug in 
someone if you found that person trying to steal your car??

If you cannot accept that people that (often) has had nothing but a troubled 
life,( no money?, no love?, no 'real' parents?, no chances in life?) has a 
tendency to commit crimes to have their share of the goodies, do something 
about the *reasons* people get 'bad'.

Hi, Dave,

Perhaps the easiest way to be sure that what you have are real Fuchs alloys
is too look inside the spokes of the wheel for a stylized "P" inside a
triangle.  That stamp indicates that the part in your hand is a real Porsche
part, and not just  a knockoff or OEM part.

This little trick works for all kinds of parts, not just wheels.

Subject: erratic oil press in 911

Ever since my top overhaul and carrera tensioner upgrade the oil
pressure gauge on my '82 911 SC has ben erratic.  By that I mean
the needle seems to bounce around a bit.  It started out not being
much of a problem, but it has become worse recently.  At idle the
needle will sit just above 1 bar but every second or so will jump
up past 5 bar and sit there for a second then drop down again.
I've seen this behaviour when running and it's the same.

Anyone got any ideas for me ?

Has anyone replaced the inner rubber boot on the drive shaft of a 911 (Turbo in
my case)? When investigating poor heater output I noticed one of the boots had
a split which means a new boot - superglue as a temporary measure. I have been
told its an easy job - simply drop the shaft off the gear box (after removing 
m10 bolts which secure it) and replace. The service manual shows drive shaft 
off the car and in a vice to do same job. 

Any advice greatly appreciated.

Good luck doing it on the car!

I just did it on my '86 carrera-axled car and it took a substanital
vise and some serious hammering with a punch to get the CV assy off the
axle, which is good, since the splines can wear making it easier but
not as good (Crystal clear I'm sure).   AAAANYWAY - Take the axle off.


Did you buy the boots yet?  The dealer wanter $72.  I ended up getting
a set of four kits for $16 each (genuine lobro) from ECI motorsports.
Tweeks has them for close to that price but you have to buy all the
parts. If you buy the kit (not just the boot) you'll get OEM clamps and
 - more importantly - an improved circlip with holes in it for circlip
pliers. (I assume the 930 kits are similar to the late carrera kits,
which are of the same oversized design).


  WHile you're at it you may as
well do the outer.  Though they do not fail as frequently - it's good
cheap insurance, as you need only remove either CV.

It's also not a bad idea to "flip" or rotate the axles occasionally to
get new wear patterns.  I do not have this luxury with the carrera
assy.

FYI,
	Steve

Subject: Exhaust temp probe on 944T

Mike asks if anyone has fooled with EGT probes

Mike, I have used EGT probes extensivly in tuning the mixture in
flat four cylinder air cooled engines.  They have all had a rather
large heavy fan bolted on the front (aircraft engines).  The mixture
is "tuned" by pulling on a mixture cable while watching rpm, egt,
fuel flow and airspeed.

  >get more information about the state of my engine and
  >possibly to aid in tuning, especially if I "chip" it.
In a perfect world your best economy is about 50 degrees lean of peak
EGT (if you can get there w/o detonation).  Best power is about 50-75
degrees rich of peak EGT.  These numbers may vary depending on CR of
the engine or something - I don't know.  The engine I fly most has a
9:1 CR.

  >I would like to install the probe in the hole where the tune-up
  >pipe comes off of the exhaust collector on its way to the turbo.
I don't think this is a good location.  Mostly because it's just too
far from the exhaust port.  You should really put it between the
heat exchanger and the head if you have heat exchangers, or at most four
inches from the exhaust port.  Also, you'll get better info if you
use 6 probes and a 6 dial gauge - what you're really interested in is
the cylinder which peaks first which changes on a day-to-day basis.  With
6 probes you can watch them change together and note which one drops off
first.

Thanks Mike,

With that advice I find that most of the wheels I looked at were Porsche
wheels though as I recall, none of the part numbers started with 911...

They all started with 901.  Does this mean that they are not original, but
OEM replacements?  If so, I wonder if there is a real diffierence as far as
quality.

If anyone is interested in a complete '88 3.2L engine and trans with 23K miles, please respond to strcklnd@aur.alcatel.com

The tail end of the trans has a crack in the casing, otherwise everything's in great shape.

It belongs to a friend of mine and he's looking for offers.

  >Has anyone replaced the inner rubber boot on the drive shaft of a 911

Piece of cake, pretty dirty though.  You'll need the right size tool and
a few extend-o-jonnies to get in there.  My advice it to jack up that side
of the car and take the wheel off - car out of gear and handbrake off.  Now
use a broomstick between the lugs to rotate the wheel - you can only get
at two bolts at a time so you need to turn the shaft and this is the
easiest way.  If you take it completely out take of the tranny end first,
and install this end last.  If you take off the wheel end first you'll
have the devil of a time trying to rotate the shaft.

Hi, Dave.
 
Look at the back of the alleged Fuchs wheel. It should have a Porsche logo
(the P in a triangle) and I think a Fuchs logo, a sort of stylized fox head.
I think also there are part numbers and a forging date back there.
 
If the inside hasn't been painted and is clean you can also make out a sort
of grain structure (big grains; cast wheels don't have this) in the back of
the forging.

Subject: Cooooooold mornings


Recently, Reno has been seeing morning temps in the low teens.

We've also seen about 1.5 feet of snow (collectively, over a week).

Since I hadn't started the Porschette for nearly a month (been
driving the Jeep), I thought it might be time to yank out the
jumper cables and starter fluid and get crazy.

Hehe, not the case.  Went out to the car, pulled about 400 lbs
of snow out of the engine compartment (had the decklid off for
maintenance, and kinda forgot to put it back on  :-), got inside
and said a quick prayer to the 914 gods.  The little bastard 
started right up!!!!!  Not even a whine!

It did, however, sound a bit odd, almost like it was missing.  
After letting it warm up a bit, I revved it to about 4500RPM,
and it still sounded icky.  OK, engine off.

I thought to myself, "it can't be missing, it's still revving so
damn high!"  I was V.wrong.  When pulling snow out of the compartment,
I yanked an injector lead off the connector.  Whoops.

Plugged it in, started it up, and Voila!!!  Everyone is happy!!!

Just an inspiring story to all those 914 owners out there who
are afraid of starting their car in the snow/cold!  

Oh, BTW, 914s handle like bunk in the snow.  The Jeep in 2WD does
better than the 914.  What a blast, tho!!!

"914s handle like bunk in the snow."  My 914 was a great year-round car --
it's just that you can't get it to last unrusted through many winters.  Small
cabin warms up quick, and the handling is just bad, not unpredictable.  I went
thru one winter of trying to diagnose what turned out to be a bad battery cable.
I had a regular routine of coming back to JFK on the redeye at 5:30am, temp
in the 20s.  Jump starting the 914 on flat ground took one easy shove and hop

        Actually Dave, most of the parts for early 911's have a 901.XXX.XXX
number.  I believe this is because the first 911 was actually called
a 901, but was changed because that number conflicted with another
car companies numbering scheme (Audi???)
        Also, the Fuchs alloys should have an imprint of a fox (fuch) on
one of the inner spokes.

Ok, lets take a breather here.

I getting flamed like crazy from the 4-banger crowd like crazy here.

This whole thing started with my tounge-in-cheek reply to George Hussey's
comment about the 914 being the best P-car, raising the "Flame Bait" 
flag.

Somehow, things escalated, and the next thing you know someone has posted
a message with my name in the first line making the traditional VW-Porsche
link, so of course I have to send another smart-ass remark about at least
they were nice volkswagens.

So, it obvious that A) People don't read things all the way thru before
the press the <FLAME> button, B) People don't think things thru before
they press the <FLAME> button, or C) there was some gross error on Stans
mail handling program that somehow turned my remarks into an anti 4-banger
tirade.

And what is this "elitist" crap?  If your want a 911 bad enough, you will
find a way to get one, even if that may include sacrifices in other aspects
of your life.  Me, I have no wife or kids or mortgage, and I wanted a
911, and nobody was gonna tell me I couldn't.  Sure, I ate mac-n-cheese
for a while, but I have something to show for it.  And once I graduate,
I'm gonna but a NICER one, maybe a mid-late 80's turbo.  So there!  
If your reasons for getting a non-911 were not financial, then I'll assume
that you made your decision based the aspects you felt were important.
Good for you, now go enjoy the car!

Now, on the mechanical end, I do know how to change a radiator on a 944,
having done two of them, the first one having never seen the inside of
a 944 engine compartment before!  So There!  

BTW - I don't mind the 4-bangers, in fact I think the 912 (especially the
912E) is a bitchin car!

How many times are will this thread raise its ugly head?

Greetings all,

I'm about 2/3's of the way through replacing the wiper motor on my '78

apart as the wiper arms and nuts removed.  I'm stymied as to how to 
remove the assembly at this point.  Haynes is useless ("remove wiper 
assembly") as to the details.  There is discussion of a 'retaining 
clip', but I don't see one.  Anyone out there done this before?

Is there a fastener holding the whole wiper unit in place that is 
hidden?  Do I just need to pull it down and out to get the wiper arm 
attachment units through the body?

Peter,

You are correct in that the Corsica has Port FI.  I have two of these cars, 
same year & drive train.  One has 75,000 and the other 24,000.  Both 
developed the same pinging problem when using Mobil regular.  Too much of a 
coincidence I figured.

I put Hess regular in one car and wife put Texaco regular in hers and both 
cars no longer ping.  Perhaps Mobil's octane is right at 87 and the others 
are at 87.5?  At least my engine is not getting beat on now by knocking. 
 Unfortunately the gas mileage is still below the norm, but that's beyond my 
control these days.

From what I recall, the octane rating rates the fuels resistance to knock, 
regardless of the fuel blend or energy content.  The test use to be (still 
is?) that an engine was run with the sample gas and it's compression 
gradually increased (dynamically as I recall) until it knocked.  A notch 
below this knocking point was the octane rating given.  A real world test 
like this should produce consistent results no matter what the fuel blend. 
 Anyone know if this is still the way it's done?

Is Ethanol the additive used in oxygenated gas?  Doesn't Ethanol alcohol 
corrode parts on fuel injected cars?  I'm pretty sure it's what's used in 
Dry-Gas, which I was told never to use FI cars.  Perhaps I'm confusing this 
with another alcohol?

Subject: 914 Crankshaft/Rod Questions Comments [longish]


I followed last week's discussion about the right and wrong way to build 
a 914 mill with great interest.  I would like to rebuild the engine in my 
1975 2.0 sometime soon.  After hearing some of the questions and 
responses related to various areas of rebuilding, I would like to post a few 
of my own so as to see what the general consensus is.  I will break it up 
into a few different posts so it is not too lengthy.

I have cut, pasted and saved as a Word document, many of the of the 
articles from the threads last week for my own use in the future.  
However, I did so without saving the full headers.  Don't be pissed if 
I use something herein that makes no reference to the brains behind it.

Here goes:

> -Use 2.0 crank, counterweighted

>>Counterweighting *ONLY* buys you anything in racing engines where you 
>>routinely exceed 7000 RPM. For "civilian" use, it adds problems, due to 
>>potential loss of hardening from welding on the counterweights. You *CAN* 
>>buy billet counterweighted cranks, but they're close to a kilobuck. Plus, 
>>you'll never even *SEE* 7000 RPM unless you do a lot more...

In conjunction with other modifications that will increase RPM, I think that 
using a forged billet crank WOULD be a good idea.  The Type IV engine was 
designed to work especially well at low RPM levels and for high mileage 
use.  Thus, you do find OE motors with 200,000 kms that are still on the 
road.  I do agree that cheaply made, welded cranks are a waste of money.  
And yes, even a stock length, forged billet counterweighted crankshaft does 
cost $1.000 ...    

> -Find 2.0 rods

>>Let me get this straight -- counterweighted crank, but STOCK rods? If you 
>>*MUST* do the counterweighted crank, then at least to the rest right -- 
>>you need Carillo rods which are over 200 grams lighter EACH and a ton 
>>stronger than stock. You can get them in stock 2.0 sizes, about $900 a 
>>set of four.

Hmmm...  I have a hard time believing that stock 2.0 rods could not 
handle a counterweighted crank, even if was only 66mm - 74mm.  There are 
Type I motors using 78.4mm cranks and OE rods that will turn 9000 RPM without 
failure (assuming that something else doesn't let go).  2.0 rods that 
have been magnafluxed, had the big end reconditioned and a new pin 
bushing properly installed should work fine with a counterweighted crank 
in an engine that spins @7500 RPM.  Tell me if I am wrong.  Naturally, 
going all the way up to an 86mm stroke is another situation all together, 
requiring the rods, cam and so on to be clearanced.

Even in trying to build a more powerful street engine, weight is the 
enemy.  To a certain point though, you should be able to rely OE parts 
like rods, the case, heads, exhaust etc.  Afterall, these parts are German 
engineered and many of these items were made to handle extremes and 
excesses.  Personal -experienced- opinion.

> -Put in the NPR "big bore" kit (96mm?)

>>Best bet is really the Euro 2.0 pistons. Or equivalent from Arias or 
>>Venolia, if you're still running after that high-rev goal. Be sure and 
>>use lightened tool steel wrist pins in that case too....

As I understand, some of these later NPR Kits used pistons made for water 
cooled engines.  Accordingly, their silicone, magnesium, nickel and 
copper content was way off for use in an air colled engine.   They were, 
cheaper to make and cheaper to buy, but their failure rate was high.  I 
agree with the comments on the Euro 2.0 Pistons. 

Has anyone head anything about Keith Black's hypereutectic cast pistons, 
good or bad?  Another question is what is the safest increase in bore size 
you can open the case to?  105mm sounds quite extreme.

In terms of wrist pins, why not dual wrist pin keepers?  It is possible 
to machine the piston to accept double snap rings thus reducing wrist pin 
end play almost entirely.

Please give me a little feedback.  I am interested to know.

Thanks,

Patrick Morton

To play the .avi file under Window's Media Player, you need MS Video for

multimedia directory, but I can't recall exactly where.  

Or, if you're desparate and/or don't have ftp access, I can mail you a copy.

I don't know what it would take to run on a sparc, tho.

Dear Chris,

Usually when the 914 dashlights fail, the rheostat (wire wound resister at
the back of the headlights switch) fails. Fortunately, the '70 - '73 switch
is relatively inexpensive. Unfortunately, the factory has superceded this
early switch with the expensive '73 - '76 switch ($240.00) new one. So - find
a used one!

Headlight Switch installation is easy. Simply remove the lower dash pad
(about 5 phillips screws) unscrew the headlight knob and slotted headlight
switch nut. Drop the fuse block and then reach up and pull the headlight
switch down from the dash.

The 914, the best Porsche ever made, is truly a Porsche for the people. They
find this wonderful sports car uncomplicated enough to work on themselves and
this great satisfaction makes 914 ownership a true hobby. (Hence, all of the
914 e-mail tech questions) The other Porsches, excluding the wonderful 356,
are not oriented towards the do-it-yourself. Consequently, these cars are not
restored or are towed to the local "Porsche mechanic", depending on him like
some god to deliver these broken down Porsches from the gates of hell! I
invite all 914 enthusiasts to respond and let Rquinn 1 (the sourpuss) know
how dearly we love our cars.

I truly believe that in the spirit of cooperation and friendship, those of
you who jealously put down the great 914, cease your outcrys and input
something helpful and/or positive - and buy a 914 - the best Porsche!

Dear Steve, 

2.0 fuel injection parts are readily available. Because of their limited
production and popularity, however, they are expensive. One call to any of
your 914 parts suppliers will set you up. I would suggest the '73 - early '74
 throttle body as it has both retard and advance ports. This will help
acceleration.

Please remember that any supplier who cares about 914s will always make sure
they keep parts like this in stock. There is nothing worse than trying to
restore your 914 and not being able to find parts to purchase!

Subject: Re: yet more 914 help


Dear Nate,

Unfortunately, we 914 owners have very few 914 repair manuals available.
Since the cars are simple enough for anyone to repair, no one except the
factory has taken it upon themselves to write a comprehensive repair manual.
And the factory one at $375.00 is quite an investment. However, it is all we
have to show one how to replace the 914 body panels. (Meaning how they fit
together and where they can be spliced) Hence, the factory manual is a good
long term investment.

Since the 914 is a unibody car, manufactured with low cost in mind, all
panels are welded together. This does not necessarily make panel replacement
more difficult, just more time consuming. (Drilling out spot welds is easy,
but takes several hours per panel.)

Before replacing any weld-on panel, however, we suggest visiting a good
unibody frame shop. They can perform a great service in making sure the
unibody is perfectly in alignment. It is hopeless to try to weld new panels
on a bent body. The shop will first pull and align the car before any panels
are removed, thus saving the ones that can be straightened. Only then will
they remove and replace hopelessly damaged panels.

The best thing you can do for your 914 1.7 engine is to install a rev
limiting rotor. This factory item will prevent over-revving accidents!

The '70 - '72 shift linkage was always sloppier than its improved '73 - '76
brother. The factory tried in the early years to use most of the 901 type
shift linkage but extended it several feet further to shift the mid-engined
914. The result was a multi-part arrangement and slop as the shift knob was
so far away from the transmission shift lever. The mechanism was totally
redesigned for the '73 year model, resulting in a superior arrangement.

Converting an early car to the late arrangement is easy but expensive as it
requires many parts in addition to just the shift linkage. We have had luck
tightening the early linkage by rebuilding it and then installing the short
shift kit. (Performance Products 800-423-3173 sells an economical one.) This
results in a tighter and more precise shifter than any factory new '70 - '72
and almost rivals the stock '73 - '76 setup.

First, thanks to everyone that bothered answering!

The list show the tool choices for the 'attendees'. 'Second tool' mean the 
user had another brand as first choice tool.

13 Sears Craftsman (2 as 'second' tools)
11 Snap-on (8 as 'second' tools)
3 Stahlwille(1 as 'second' tools)
3 Hazet ( 2 as 'second' tools)
2 Hey'co ( 2 as 'second' tools)
1 MAC ( as 'second' tools)
1 Lysle ( as 'second' tools)
1 Elora ( as 'second' tools)
1 Stanley ( as 'second' tools)
1 Diamond ( as 'second' tools)
1 Proto ( as 'second' tools)
1 Bahco 
1 USAG ( as 'second' tools)

Everyone used Baum special tools, where appropriate.

If this was a christmas list I'd guess 'Stahlwille' would be at the top? :-)

Most guys chose Sears because of quality and lifetime guarantee, then they 
complemented with Snap'on tools.

MY (veeery subjective) opinion is that Stahlwille and Snap'on is the best 
tools, both from an ergonomic and design viewpoint. The materials are the 
best and the tools are delightful to work with.

In defense of Sears, I must admit I never have tried these tools and cannot 
rate them.

Hi,

A Christmas tip to all you wannabe Nigels (or Mario's) out there.

Papyrus has released one smashing new racegame called NASCAR.

The first PC race simulator running in SVGA mode. (Better have a Pentium 90 
for that task,.....or even a POWER PC/MAC!)

Myself having their last release INDYCAR racing, I'll more than recommend 
both these games. 

I even asked the developers at papyrus to create new sprites that looked 
like Porsche 356's, and that I'd be glad to buy an add on package with this. 
I guess they didn't see the potential there..(Neither would the Cosworth XB 
engine be appropriate).  ;-)

There is an INDYCAR demo for PC at ftp.std.com in the directory 
/vendors/papyrus and it is called icrdemo.zip

There *might* be a NASCAR demo out there too.

Cheers,
Trond.

	I have a mix on Craftsman and snap-on and definitely prefer the snap-on.
Why ? durability ! Sure the craftsman has a lifetime guarantee; that means that
when I break one I have to go get a replacement. My snap-on stuff doesn't break.
Seems like I always have a collection of broken craftsman tools in the car for 
the next time I am near a sears (currently 1 3/8 ratchet that doesn't and 1 
screwdriver with a "spiral" tip). I think the worst are the 8-pt deep sockets. 
The 5/8 used on heads of chevy small blocks is convenient for assembly, but breaks 
before you get the head torqued properly to 140 ft-lb. You would think that after 
breaking a couple of these I would remember to switch before the socket breaks and 
my finger gets squashed on a rocker stud, but for some reason I don't. If I
was starting over, I would buy all snap-on.

Subject: 914 Vibration

I have a pretty bad vibration problem in my 914

It has had this problem ever since I got it back from the shop that
repaired the rust from underneath the battery.

There was a LOT of rust damage, so frame stiffeners (PartsWorks
preformed heavy-duty) were installed at that time.

I've replaced the shocks and (rear) springs, had the suspension
aligned, and replaced the tires.

The only thing I can think of that I haven't tried is replacing the
rear wheel bearings.

The vibration seems to be speed sensitive, and to make matters worse,
it changes from day to day.

Any clues?


Oh, and while I'm on the subject, I have bilstein shocks at all 
four corners, and 110 lb Eibach springs in the rear.  Should I
go with heavier torsion bars in the front?  I don't want the car
to be as stiff as most track cars though.....  And assuming I can
remove the source of the vibration.

This is interesting news.  When did they supercede the earlier switch.  I
looked into purchasing a switch for my '73 about six weeks ago and both
versions were still available from the dealer here.  Neither were
particularly inexpensive though.  They quoted me about $150 for the early
switch and about $250 for the later switch.

Not knowing which switch I needed, I didn't order either of them.  The main
difference (from my uneducated glance at the parts drawing) appeared to be
mechanical, particularly in how the knob-shaft assembly was attached to the
switch body.

Does anyone know what, if any, the electrical differences are between these
switches.

Undaunted, I am continuing my quest for a Carrera. One is being sold in

Single owner (private sale), all service records and has just had a

I understand that the '86's do not have the way cool rock-solid transmission

that I should be aware of? Anyone out there have an '86 with transmission
problems? How different are the two years? The asking price is in the high

    I'm not quite sure I agree with this.  It is a bit of an investment
(i.e., about 4-5 times the cost of the non-limiting rotor), and it will
not help in a mis-shift (i.e., wanted 4th, got 2nd).  Most (actually,
all) of the people that I have heard about that have blown their engines
have done so by shifting into the wrong gear.
    It seems to be difficult to push a stock early 2.0L engine up to 
the point where it shreds itself--I found that it runs out of air in
second gear up around 6300 RPM (at a guess).  I couldn't figure out why
the car wouldn't accelerate when I had my foot on the floor, and then
saw that I was somewhat up over red-line...  OOPS!
    1.7s may be different in that respect, I don't know.
    BTW, after that experience, I did put a rev-limiter on the car.
    And I think that the best thing you can do for the car is to keep

There are only THREE possibilities here

1) you are building a stock engine -- BONE STOCK, by The Book

2) you are building an engine for a specific application governed by
   a particular set of rules

3) you don't have a clear application and you just want more power
   and you spend too much time reading magazines about what other
   people SAY they've done and you're a[n] (choose one) engineer/great
   mechanic/hot shoe/all-around-smart-guy-and-how-hard-can-this-be
   and YOU CAN DO IT. (in the profile, you also typically want it
   to last at least as long as a stock engine, and to be cheaper to
   build, and you want to do all the work youself)

Possiblilty Number One is easy -- buy OE parts from reputable suppliers
and follow all of the instructions in the FACTORY workshop manual and
you're set.

Possibility Number Two is also not too difficult. The Rules will tell you
what you can and can't do, so some of the Cool Stuff that you may have
heard of will not be usable. Your competition will also tell you what
you need to do to compete -- if he can all of a sudden pull an extra
1200 RPM on you, you'd better figure it out. He may tell you, or you 
may be able to buy an engine from his supplier.

Possibility Number Three: you're on your own. You have NO friends --
all of the vendors want to sell you stuff, and will ASSURE you that
it will Work Just Fine with the other stuff you have. By the time it
becomes clear it doesn't, ooops, it's a used part, and the Oklahoma
Guarantee is in effect (the short version: if it breaks in half, you
still own both pieces). Those helpful magazine articles? They're *TYPICALLY*
just blowing some advertiser, or future advertiser, or supplier to the
guy that wrote the article or SOMETHING. Not quite National Enquirer
material, but definitely not JSAE.

Given that, let me state my position here: I'm not selling anything
(but if you want to have us build you an engine we can do that). I
have spent a LONG time building engines in my Catagory 1 and 2, and
doing a lot of experimental work to push the limits for Cat. 2 in an
ever-escalating battle with the guys at SCCA, IMSA, and now PCA to
make more power while not breaking their envelope. Sometimes I even
cheat, in part because "everyone is doing it" and in part because the
rules are sometimes so sloppy that you *CAN* cheat the "intent" of the 
rule but get away with it on technicalities.

In my opinion, these questions (and for that matter MOST of the questions
on the list) are Category 3. In part, that's why I *STARTED* the list --
to open this up for access to more people that had more experience to
bring to bear. But, as always, bear in mind that you're walking into
terra incognito as you build *YOUR* engine "your way". So do it, or 
don't -- you'll have to live with the results. Not me.

That said, on to the answers:

*WILL NOT* increase RPM; *WILL* let you do *OTHER THINGS* to increase
RPM and not cause the case to grenade. You can run a stock non-counterweighted
(or better, a forged billet non-counterweighted) crank up just as high as 
you can a counterweighted crank. The big difference: what's left of the
case after you've done this for a while. And in some cases (typically not
914 or 911, though) how bent the crank is from whipping. 

This modification adds LIFE not power. PERIOD.

OK, you're wrong. Do the math. See what the loading on the rod bolts is
at 7500 RPM using stock pistons, wrist pings and rods. The stock rod bolts
won't hang in for very long. You *MUST* drop the weight *AND* increase
both the clamping force and bolt strength. Hence, Carrillo.

Sure, for a STREET ENGINE (Cat 3) where you don't SUSTAIN high RPMs 
you *MAY* may be able to get away with it. But in the real world of Cat 2
*RACING* engines, you can't.

And two more points: if you went to a stroker crank, you'd REALLY need to
go to custom rods and typically pistons anyway due to the need to preserve
a reasonable internal geometry. And "reconditioned" rods (ie. those that
have the big ends "done") are evil. They no longer have the same amount of
metal at the margins of the hole, and you've potentially induced stress
risers in the re-boring process. Again, OK (but not GREAT) for STREET
engines, but if you're gonna put it on a track, just don't do it.

And my *PROFESSIONAL* -experienced- opinion is that the OE parts are
wonderful until you want to exceed their limits. German engineering does
not equate to perfection, in fact, it TYPICALLY means that the part is
perfectly economized -- it's just EXACTLY right for its intended application
and when you call the factory up and say "I want the engineering info on
X so I can make it do Y" they act like you're crazy and say "why would
you *POSSIBLY* want to do that when you could just buy this other 
model and have something better?"

I've heard, but haven't experiemented. So it's just hearsay, and you get
enough of that here anyway. I *HAVE* done the 101.5mm TRW pistons on a
911, though, and it's essentially the same thing. Works great -- for a
RACING ENGINE. Gotta check those babies out about every 30 hours and replace
about every 2nd inspection. Think about what 60 hours is on the street, and
think about do you want to rebuild every what, week and a half? Three weeks
max??

Also, DO THE MATH -- what else is required to make them work. Rods, 
probably. Case machining - you bet -- and is THAT going to cause problems
because now the cylinder spigots aren't supported as well (yes) and
what does that do to case life (shortens it, sure, but HOW MUCH).

Teflon pin inserts work a lot better. And pin end-play is typically NOT
an issue -- pin WEIGHT and STRENGTH are. Hence the recommendation for
lightened tool steel on RACING ENGINES.

Yes...very true.  To the uninformed though, *VERY* clean oil may
be a problem....  A couple of weeks ago a mechanic friend of mine
rebuilt a guy's 914 2.0L engine.  A couple of days ago the owner
phoned up my friend in a panicked voice and said their was no
oil in the engine - it all leaked out!  He added another quart and
nothing was showing on the dipstick!  The car was then towed to the
mechanic's house where he found that there *WAS* oil in the engine;
it was too full - the owner just couldn't see the oil on the dipstick
because it was so clean.  After draining out the excess oil, the rather
embarrassed owner sheepishly drove off....

Subject: 931 oil pressure drop: why?

Item for the collective wisdom of the P-philes:

My '80 931 oil pressure recently dropped, as read by the dashboard
guage.  Where the pressure used to be 4 or 5 bar (highway, 2500rpm,
warm), it is now in the 1.5 to 2.5 bar... making me EXTREMELY nervous
about driving the car at all.

What might be the prime suspect?  I can think of three possibilities:

1) Oil pump (yikes! I hope not)

2) sump intake/screen (40k+ miles since I dropped the pan :-( )

3) Oil pressure sender.

How might I tell the difference?  My idea is to check the most
available solution first: drop the pan, clean the intake.

Ideas/advice??

Amen to that. I got my first 911 by going to a dealer in Stuttgart, getting
a price quote, comparing that to a U.S. dealer quote the next time I was
home in the U.S., finding the German price lower, figuring delivery time and
how many more paychecks would come in before that, I ordered the thing. At
that time, the gray market did not exist and German dealers could sell U.S.
spec cars. It absolutely cleaned out my bank account, but I never looked
back. I later wound up working for the company (the standard joke is that
I couldn't afford the parts any other way). That first car was built in
early 1981, I had friends in the factory and they tipped me off to when it
was going down the line. I have baby pictures of the half-finished shell,
and me doing a Kilroy with my head and fingers halfway out of the empty
engine compartment.

Hi, Trond.
 
Sorry, Trond, the following is not intended as a personal attack. I realize
that Europeans and Americans have different attitudes on average at least,
and the extremes are even farther apart. OK, it's not your fault, it's your
European upbringing (I had one of those too, but outgrew it). <g>
 
>how many of you guys/girls would *really* put a slug in someone if you
>found that person trying to steal your car?
 
Like other people who responded, I would too, under the right circumstances.
(Likewise, "if I could get away with it.") As in the story (true or not) about
the guy having the 911 taken at gunpoint. Nowadays it is reasonable to
assume that if the thief has a gun, he might just shoot you driving away. So
yes, shooting him first could be justified. And if the thief did not have
the gun, I suppose he would listen to reason and leave the car again after
seeing the owner's gun. So you see, he got killed not because he stole the
car, but because he made inapproprate use of a firearm (i.e. pointed it at
somebody who also had a firearm). And the car owner was very lucky not to be
killed himself. I don't propose that
every car thief deserves to be shot, but those with guns do. The others
deserve no less than a solid beating. It would perhaps discourage them from
continuing this habit.
 
>troubled life (no money? no love? no 'real' parents?) Do something about
the *reasons* people get 'bad.'
 
Not my problem. Talk to Bill and Hillary. But seriously, nothing is going to
make them get "good" except the equivalent of a good swift kick up the butt,
something they needed but didn't get in childhood. A few of this sort being
killed while trying to steal a car at gunpoint might work. Was it Voltaire
who said you have to hang an admiral every now and then "to encourage the
others?"
 
Also there is no shortage of human beings on the planet, and perhaps it
would be to everyone's advantage to make sure that the type described above
does not have opportunity to breed.
 
Turn this argument around. How would you feel if somebody stole your 356
from you, after you had spent how many years restoring it? Can you put a
dollar (or kroner) value on this person's life? Is it worth as much as your
car? Would you be willing to have this life form committed to an institution
at *YOUR* expense, to save its life? Do you think that would 'rehabilitate'
the person? Or would a good beating be cheaper and more effective?

As far as I know, this is still the standard method for fuel octane rating
specified by the ASTM (American Society for the Testing of Materials). The
engine is called a CFR (for Cooperative Fuel Research) engine, made by the
Waukesha Engine Co. of Wisconsin. In Europe, they may use a similar engine
built by AVL in Austria. The CFR is available in gasoline and diesel
versions (for cetane rating), and the compression ratio of each can be
varied while it's running. On the gas engine, the entire head is raised and
lowered. On the diesel, a plug is moved in and out of the prechamber. The
engines have three small fuel chambers, for two reference fuels and the
test fuel. For octane ratings, two different sets of test parameters are
used, one for "research" rating and a harsher set of conditions (intake air
temp higher, etc) for "motor" rating. The average of the two is the number
posted on the fuel pump. Octane rating is determined by finding a reference
fuel blend of n-heptane (octane defined as zero) and 2,2,4 trimethylpentane
(isooctane), defined as octane = 100. So if a test fuel knocks just as badly
as a blend of 92 percent by volume of isooctane and 8 percent n-heptane, it
has an octane rating of 92. Knock is quantified by a "knockmeter" consisting
of a bouncing pin and an indicator. This system was laid down before WW2 and
has not changed since then.

Frank Collins, my friend and neighbourhood Porsche mechanic has an 85/2
Gold 944 (brown full leather int.) for sale. Here's the deal:

                43,000 miles
                16" 3pc. gold BBS wheels
                Factory ltd. slip diff.

but not springs)
                stainless brake lines
                code alarm

The car has been serviced with Mobil 1/Swepco/Super Blue brk. fluid all of
it's life. The car has just had all new belts put on. Also, a set of Fuchs
alloys with winter 190's will be thrown in, if the buyer wishes (if the
buyer does not want the Fuchs/tires, then a lower price for the car could
be had).

I personally have no interest  in the sale of this car. Frank is selling it
because he has his eye on a '66 912 that has been sitting for 15 years and
is in mint condition. If he buys the 912 without selling the '44, his wife
will kill him.

Finally, it is worth noting that Frank is a registered Porsche master
technichian, and has taken good care of the car. It has only been tracked
once (this past year at Road America).

        He is asking $9,500 or best offer.

If you are interested in this car, you can e-mail me (trevs944@mixcom.com)
or call Frank directly @: 708-726-1754.

You forgot a couple:

a) wrong viscosity oil
b) bad main bearings
c) bad oil pressure gauge

My (a) and your (1) and (2) are pretty unlikely. Unless  you have
an external belt-driven oil pump (common on certain racing cars
but damn near no street cars) oil pump failur of that magnitude is
pretty unlikely.

The most likely would be your (3) and/or my (c) -- the instrumentation
is hosed. Can do a quick check with a mechanical oil pressure gauge.
If it still shows low, problem is elsewhere, otherwise you just gotta
figure out which end is bad.

If you REALY have bad pressure, it's probably bearings. It *could* be
something simple like an oil pressure bypass valve gone wonky,
but given the age of the car, you're due...

Martin,

Check the oil pressure sender, which is mounted on the right side
of the fan in a block which also feeds the right side cam oil
line.  It has a stinky little connector which always seems loose
to me.  You erratic gauge may be because of loose/dirty connections,
or due to an oil pressure sender which is nearing the end of its
useful existence.

If I later got a clue to where my car was/whom stole it, I'd be putting on

Subject: Re: Removing 911 wiper assembly

I did this replacement a while back.  Once the vent system is out of
the way, I removed the large nuts that are on the outside of the car
where the wipers attach.  At this point I wiggled the remaining
hardware loose that is on the outside.  This can be tedious but not
difficult.  Once that is out of the way, the wiper unit will move back
and down.

A couple of notes; If you remove the clock and speedo you can get
pretty good visibility of the wiper motor assembly from inside the car.  This
will be helpfull in that I found it easier to remove the electrical
connections from inside the car.

Also, the failure in my wiper unit (and many I'm told) is gauling (sp?)
of the actuator rods that connect to the wipers.  I did some minor
disassembly on the wiper unit and greased them before installation.

If I can be of more help let me know.

Hi out there,
   Thanks for all your help in finding a garage in Massachusetts.  Looks
like I've found a reputable place.  It is  Stuttgart Northeast in Danvers
Mass.  They are a small private garage, servicing only Porsches since 1978.
They replaced my front oil seals for less than 1/3 the cost estimate from my
local Porsche dealer.  Plus, the 2K mile belt retension will be free.
(saving another $100).  With a few days advance notice, they completed the 
work in less than 1 day, and I could pick up the car as late as 7 pm.
I hope/expect this level of service will continue.


One happy customer.

Same here, some days the steering wheel oscillates like an out of balance 
fron tire and other days I can feel it in the seats like an out of balance 
rear tire.  It seems to be worse around 60-75mph, can't afford to go faster

Subject: 924S and winters


Porsche guys/gals,

I have two questions that are somewhat related.
1)  What do people think of the '87/'88 924S?  I would be thinking of 
    this car as an everyday driver.  I don't see many of them for sale
    but I have noticed that they seem to average around $6000 for 30k to 
    50k miles.  I realize that they have the 2.5L from the 944 so the 
    performance level should be equal if not a little better than a 944
    from the same time period.  For those that own them or are familiar 
    with them, what do you think?  Would you consider them to be reliable?
    I welcome all opinions and responses.
2)  This question is related since I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  How 
    many people on this group live in cold, snowy, winter weather areas like
    myself?  Of those that do, how many drive your porsches in the winter?
    What are your opinions, or is this an evil thing to do if I truly have
    the love?

Thanks in advance,
Ryan

P.S.  Not that anybody cares, but I started on this group a couple months ago
      when I bought my first porsche, a 914.  I bought it for $500 so it 
      needs lots of work.  Well so far all I've accomplished is getting the
      engine and tranny out and getting them in a warm workshop.  The car is
      supposed to be a 2.0L but I haven't proven that it is yet.  I know 
      there should be a GA code between the oil filler and the fan housing.
      I haven't found that yet, but I haven't had time to clean the engine,
      so it could be under 1/4" crude.  Isn't there some way to tell if it
      is a 2.0L buy the heads? the number of exhaust flange studs or 
      something?  Thanks.

I like irony as much as the next guy, maybe more, but this one cut a little 
close:  within hours after my shooting my mouth off here about how the US is
not as lawless as it is made out, my Vanagon was broken into and its radio
stolen.  Pouring rain; "guarded" lot; seat not that wet when I got in -- 
bastards probably still in the lot when I got to the car.  My first problem
in seven years in Newark, so intellectually my point is still valid, but for

Subject: car theft in US



For those contemplating visiting the US, maybe I can put
the problem into perspective:

The chance of being carjacked (car stolen at gunpoint) in 99.9% 
of the US is about as likely as finding a mint 356 Speedster for
sale by an elderly neighbor for $1,000. The chance of being
carjacked in the bad part of New York, Newark, Miami, L.A. (insert
your favorite big city here) is about the same as finding a 924
for sale by a not-so-elderly neighbor for $1,000 (still not that great
but not nearly so improbable).

Every major US city now has a "preditor zone" where most sensible
people wouldn't go at night. The reason, IMHO, isn't guns but the
failure of our justice system to lock up people who use them in
violent crimes.  

This is a wonderful country to visit, but unfortunately the criminal
element has learned that foreign tourists are often easy targets in
places like Florida. What a shame.

Is the vibration more previlent after car sits for a few days??

Could be the tires flat spotting and taken some time to work their way 
round again.

Did you ck you tie rods and or tie rods ends. 
shimmy or just a vibration?
real wheel bearings.

just a couple of suggestions

Hi All,

	I've been seeing this thread of insurance coverage going on now.
And while I can't say anything about time trial coverage, I can say that
some companies will cover autox/Solo II events. I have had personal
experience with this in the past. I was one of those rare cases where a car
gets totalled in autox. The insurace company didn't even hesitate.  I was
sure they's drop me like a bad habit. But they simply stuck it in as a
claim on my collision poilicy and rased my rates by the same amount that
one ticket would. It did take a while though, but they came through with a
MORE than fair settlement.

Dry-Gas, which I was told never to use FI cars.  Perhaps I'm confusing this 
with another alcohol?


1. Ethanol may be used to suppliment oxygenated gas but it is not the
active component in oxygenated gas. MTBE is the active component in
oxygenated gas. It is possible ethanol is used in the manufacture of
MTBE. But ethanol is not a primary oxygenator of gasoline. It is a fuel
suppliment to reduce the amount of petrolium based products required to
produce a gallon of gas. Whether or not ethanol in gas is bogus because
of domestic politics is irrelevant to it's function. How it works and
what it does is an objective issue which can be tested and measured.
Whether or not it should be in fuel in the first place is subjective
and open to many different, but valid, subjective opinions.

2. Gasoline with significant ethanol content contains more molecular
water than gasoline alone. Water is soluble in both fuels but ethanol
increases the solubility of the water significantly. This results in
increassed rust in fuel system components which alledgedly (and I think
logically) meand MFI 911s and 914/6s could experience increased risk to
corrosion of the MFI mechanial innards. I do not know how increaed
exposure to water can effect more modern FI systems.

3. I do not know what is in Dry-Gas but it is reasonable to assume it
is some sort of alcohol or mixture of alcohols. The idea is if your
fuel has been saturated with water, then excess water (once the amount
of water present exceeds the solubility of the water in gasoline)
seperates out throughout your fuel system. The additive (alcohol)
increases the solubility of the water and therefore fuel line blockages
in sub-freezing weather can be avoided. The water is still there but it
is dissolved in the gasoline.

I neither defend or attack ethanol in fuel. I do think there is a great
deal of confusion about this. I will never use gas supplimented with
ethanol in my 1971 911E. If I owned a car designed from day one to burn
ethanol supplimented fuel, I would use it if it were convenient.

> the 928 which should have been a Mercedes

A Mercedes?  I never heard this before.  Your own thoughts, or is this 
actually documented somewhere?  Finding documentation on the 928 is a rare 
find, I'd be interested in reading this bit of history.

Everything I have read on the 928 (of which there is almost nothing) leads 
me to believe the car was developed by Porsche to always be a Porsche with 
sites aimed at the US market, which was (still is?) half+ their sales.  Is 
this not true?

From what I read, the 928 development began in the early 70's in response to 
the US Feds possibly coming down on the quirky handling 911.  Seems a few 
people were killed in them.  Seems that the early 911 had a tendency to swap 
ends in a corner.  Granted Mr. Joe Consumer/weekend warrior was probably 
doing things faster than they should have with their skill set.  Money 
doesn't buy driving skill.

This wasn't too long after the Chevy Corvair fiasco (rear air cooled engine 
sporty car), so Porsche was more than just a little concerned.  Porsche 
developed a front engine V-8 with rear wheel drive to conform more or less 
with the "safer" standard Detroit layout of the era.  Perhaps some pressure 
from Detroit was in the mix to nix the Vette's competition?

Anyone have anymore insight on this or can recommend any books with more 
than a mention of the 928 in it?

Subject: Re: 914 Vibration


Dear Gary,

I assume you have a seat of the pants "shaking" vibration not a harmonic
vibration or steering wheel shake.

If so, it is in the rear of the  car and is caused by one of the following:

1. Tire balance:  It seems these days that it takes a college education to
balance tires. Very careful balancing of the tires is a necessity especially
as tire sizes widen.
   A. Tires worn out of round or flat spotted
   B. Tires worn or worn unevenly
2. Tire balance:  Everyone overlooks the most obvious source of "shaking"
vibration. Carefully balance the tires, inspect the wheels for runout and/or
bends, switch the complete set of wheels and tiresfrom that of another
vehicle that does not "shake".
3. Towed in alignment condition:  This causes the inside edge of the tires to
"scollop" and shake/vibrate. If your shop removed the swing arms and
reinstalled them when doing the welding, the car could now need alignment.
4. Loose rear wheel bearings:  Remove the wheel and castlenut cotter pin and
retorque the stub axle castlenut (30 - 35 MKG)
5. CV axle joints dry or worn:  This is something many overlook. Remove both
axles and disassemble the CV joints. Inspect for wear. Repack carefully or
replace.

Rear wheel bearing, when bad, whines, but we have never had one cause a
vibration. 

Stock torsion bars are perfect for your setup; we wouldn't change them. If
you have no sway bars installed and want heavier torsion bars, you could
install 21 MM torsion bars. This would make the handling flatter, but stiffen
the ride while producing more "push" or understeer.

     This new thread concerning guns and Porsches is very disturbing. I
sincerely hope this doesn't lead to anyone carrying a loaded handgun in their
car. I know if I had one there'd be a few less idiots driving around, but
then I'd be languishing in prison somewhere. The temptation to kill someone
who seems to be (or actually is) too stupid to live would just be too great.
     I can't believe the guy who quoted the California state penal code so
we'll all know if it's OK to kill someone the next time we're there. I also
have a hard time believing the "briefcase" story. If I was stealing someone's
car I can't imagine thinking "yeah, I'll steal this guy's car, but gee, I
don't want to inconvienence him by taking his important papers". Did you get
this story out of Handgun Magazine?
     The best way to avoid becoming a victim is by not putting yourself in a
vulnerable position. Lock your doors when you drive, avoid high crime areas,
and think about what that cop is gonna say when you're stopped for speeding
and he finds a loaded weapon in your Porsche. If someone does point a gun at
you, give him (or her) whatever they ask for. There's lots of Porsches out
there, but only one you.

    From talking to several gear-heads here at work (and some of the

least partially because they are pretty reasonably priced.  Snap-on

expensive.  Trucks from both those companies come by here regularly--

    And I use Craftsman because they're cheap and good (in that order).

This has always been my understanding.  I would also disagree with
Stan's earlier remark that the 911 has been Porsche's only "clean
slate" car.  The 928 also started from a blank piece of paper.  It included
a number of significant design features, such as the toe-correcting rear

Subject: Upgrading to a newer 911 car.

Hello all, Happy Thanksgiving (to people in the US anyways)!

First off, I enjoy the tech talk about building the engines.  I am 
a wanabee-category 3, and probably would never undertake this, as my
current car has never been apart, and all the bolts appear frozen,
corroded/rusted under my 911.

I have 1981 911SC Targa, European Model, 60K miles, 930 RUF-widebody 
conversion car, converted by a professional body shop with Porsche 
factory panels, and a new paint job.  The car looks new inside and
out.  The engine is still the stock 3.0L.  I am thinking about selling
this next spring and getting a newer car next season.  I want to go 
with something with more power (don't we all) such as a 930 Turbo.
I realize that a newer Turbo will be considerably more expensive than
a newer 911, but I do not want to part with the widebody look.  It
should be obvious since I had my 911 converted to this style, just
for the looks.  I paid $15K for a 911 car that looks like $100+K 964.

How much quicker does the 3.2 Carerra feel than the 3.0L 911 I have 
now?  Did they make a 3.2 non-turbo widebody?  I have had the 3.0 
for almost 3 years now, and feel it is quicker than the average Ford 
Probe, etc.  My main goal in upgrading is to get more power and a
somewhat newer car which should handle better.  I would like something 
that pulls more from 2K up to 5.5K RPM's.  The 3.0L pulls well in 2nd gear
but not REALLY strong until 4K RPM's.  I was told the 3.2's really
pull more, pulling strongly from 2K instead of 4KRPM, and thus are 
a slight bit quicker.  My roomate, who drives a Toyota MR2, was driving
with me the other day and said "I can't believe the acceleration this
car has."  I said "Really?  You think so?  I must be used to it I guess."

Furthermore, I want to get the newer molded body style (bumpers without 
the bellows).  As you can see, I am concerned with looks, as well as a 
bit more acceleration and handling.  Is this a newer Porsche I am looking 
for?  Or a new engine (3.2L) and suspension mods for my current car?  Would
a new engine and suspension basically give me what I want for less money
than just getting a newer car?  How much can the suspension be upgraded.

Now, from a 3.2L, up to a 3.6, is there again, a significantly noticeable
increase in power?  Are there 3.6L non-turbo widebody styles, or are all
the 3.6 engines turbos?  I have never ridden in any other Porsche than
the one I own now, and no one drives it but myself.  Sad isn't it?  Are 
the Turbo's remarkably faster than the 911's?  I want to test drive a 
newer Porsche, but feel bad about going to a dealer, when I know in my 
head I am not looking new.  If I pull up in my current Porsche, do they 
mind letting people test drive newer models, or do you have to really front 
that you are looking to buy one?

I am no expert in Porsches.  I am no motorhead, nor do I race.  I just 
love the look, handling, and feel of the car.  And to be perfectly honest, 
there is something to be said for the head-turning, awe-inspiring, sickly-
materialistic, rich feeling of driving the car around town with the top
off wearing my ripped jeans and a little Stevie Ray Vaughn in the speakers.
I think it's time for my counseling now.

Thanks again, and happy holidays.

Beacuse I live in the "tundra" and as of Wednesday am a proud owner
of a '87 911 Targa, I am also interested in storage tips.  I've been
meaning to preruse the archives for tidbits, but I'm too busy enjoying
our limited good weather...

Anyway, I paraphrased the following from an article by Paul Brand in
the Minneapolis Star Tribune Oct 9, 1994).  All editorial comments and
spelling errors are mine.

 - Choose the last nice day you want to drive the vehicle.  Take it on
  a nice cruise for at least 30 minutes.  Enjoy yourself.  On the way
  home, fill the gas tank.  Get "real" gas, not ethanol-blended stuff
  for storage.  The ethanol blends contain more water, which may result
  in corrosion in the FI systems of older cars.

 - Once home, perform routine maintenance including oil and filter
  changes, chassis lube, cooling system flush,  transmission fluid and
  filter change, change brake fluid, etc.  Add fuel stabilizer and allow
  the car to run for a bit to let the stabilizer permeate the fuel system.

 - Check the air in the tires.  Remember that pressure falls with lower
  ambient temperatures, so you may want to over-inflate the tires (but
  remember to bleed off the extra air in the spring).  There is no need
  to put the car on jack stands...

 - Thoroughly wash, dry, and wax the car.  Clean the interior as well, using
  vinyl and leather protectants where appropriate.

 - Disconnect and remove the battery.  Fully charge it now and once a month
  or so to keep it ready for the spring.

 - Place "blocks" under the wiper arms so that the wiper blades do not
  sit on the glass.  This will prevent the blades from taking a "set"
  and being nearly useless in the spring.

 - On air-cooled cars, leave the heater controls open.  (why? - mjt)

 - Open the side windows a crack to allow air circulation, but not so far
  as to allow small critters inside.  Plug the exhaust  and fresh air
  intakes to prevent unauthorized entry by small critters.  Place several
  small packets of "silica gel" in the interior to absorb excess moisture.
  Cover the car with a lightweight cover.


DON'Ts

 - Don't store the battery on a concrete floor.  Put it on a couple of
  blocks of wood.  Some people think that the concrete "reacts" with the
  battery, thus rendering it useless.  More likely the concrete slab
  is a good heat sink and that's really what does the poor thing in.
  (Anyone got the real story here, or is this just an urban legend? - mjt)

 - Don't put the car on jack stands.  Most modern tires won't "flat-spot"
  very badly over the winter.  If you must put the car in the air, lower
  the tire pressure to 15 psi.  Remember to reinflate the tires in the
  spring.

 - Don't start the car periodically.  Cold starts after weeks of inactivity
  in extreme cold are not helpful to the oil-feed components.  Short periods
  of idling without significant load are not enough to fully warm the oil
  and evaporate the raw fuel and moisture that condense inside the engine
  on a cold start.

  If you must: make sure the car gets *driven* to fully warm it up.  If
  applicable, run the AC to circulate the refrigerant/lubricant to keep
  the seals fresh.  But, remember that freon condenses into a pure liquid
  at -22F (January in Minnesota - mjt) so starting the car to run the AC
  at this temperature is useless anyway.

Does anyone have comments, changes, suggestions, etc?

Subject: re; another stupid opinion on shooting thieves


     Regarding the story of the guy who pulls a gun out of his briefcase
   and shoots a carjacker; for one, I don't believe it. Even drug addicts 
   are smarter than to let a guy pull, point and shoot a gun out of a 
   briefcase. I might have believed the man hitting the thief with the
   briefcase itself, but I'll bet the rest is urban folklore.
 
      In Texas, you can legally shoot a person to stop a crime. Realistically,
   culturally things are such in Texas that no jury here would EVER convict
   you of shooting a criminal. In the days of the Menendez brothers shooting 
   someone perceived as a lowlife puts you right up there with Charles
   Bronson. Recently in Houston a repo-man was shot in the driveway of

help!
my 944 brake agonies continue.
I brought the car to the local dealer, and they say I need front/rear 
pads & rotors, & maybe calipers... UNFORTUNATELY, they will only use OEM 
parts.. these are <heinously> expensive.

Can anyone recommend a good repair shop in the ann arbor area, or at 
least give me the name of a PCA member in my area? 

I fear if I don't find a good independent shop i may have to get rid of 
my precious 944. <sniff>

thanks in advance.

In my Haynes manual, they say drop both the engine, and the tranny to get at
the clutch.  A shop I called to get a quote said they'd only drop the engine
and I've been told that one only needs drop the tranny.  I think that about
covers all the possibilites, but which is the easiest/best way to do it?

What special tools will I need, and where can I get them.  I've been told
that I'll need a clutch pilot tool, but I'm not sure what this is.  Is this
used to remove the pilot bearing?  If I need to work on the flywheel when
I'm there I'll need a locking tool.  One person already told me about this
stuff but I acidenatlly erased the message, so I'm sorry if it seems that
I've ignored you.

Hi All,

I've been following the thread about crimes and punishment for some things 
that could only remotely happen to any of us. There are crimes against
Porsche owners that warrant much sooner resolution:

Driving slowly in left lane, failing to yield to rapidly approaching Porsche
(or any car). = thirty days confined to the New York Subway system with a 
dunce cap on head.

Truck throwing debris and damaging new concour paint job. = stoning of 
drivewr by local PCA region.

Door opened against Porsche, leaving damage. = walked over while in prone 
position (local option face up or down) by local PCA region. Hobnailed boots
encouraged. 2nd offense, fingers in own door opened and closed by 
local Porsche region.

Cut off Porsche because driver hates them. = a hate crime that is a Federal 
offense, must ride tricycle to work for 30 days. 2nd offense, condemmed to
driving a Yugo for 2 years.

Failing to pronounce Porsche correctly. = 2 months listening to "Hooked on 
Phoneics- Sylvester Stallone teaches Bronx". Listener will beg to pronounce
it correctly.

Insisting one Porsche is better than another. = 6 months driving in a 1948 
Renault Daphine.

Acting like T*D on Porschephiles. = exile. No deposit, no return.


There are many other punishable things, perhaps the other Porschephilers 
can help Larry Wilson compile them for a more intense (or humorous) list.

i'll field this one..  I've got an '87 944. the mechanicals are identical 
to the 924, and infact the 924 has a 1mph higher top end (it's more 
aerodynamic)
as for winters....  i've been thru the crappiest upstate NY and michigan 
could throw at me.  There were a few times where the car made me nervous 
(ie, white-knuckles) but for most of the winter it works OK. I ditched 
the stock Pirelli P6's (deathtraps in winter) & replaced 'em with 
Yokohama AVS +4's .  runs like a charm.

you may wish to hold out for a 944, b/c they have a much nicer interior 
than the 924... but otherwise, it's a good buy.

    Dear 911 aficionado,
    
    A quick response to the following flame bait...

If the real reason a Porsche was invented was for racing, 944's beat the 
911's regularly.  An 84 944 will run faster than an equally prepared 911 83SC 
in any time trial situation and the 944 has a 200lb and 50hp disadvantage.   
A 944, with the same horsepower and weight, will be much faster.  (I'll be 
glad to send track records for verification).  Where did you come up with a 
944 is a Volkswagen anyways?  The 911, although a beautiful Porsche, still 
struggles with its weight distribution (LSA suspension included).  
    
The 914 is an elegantly designed entry level Porsche.  The 914's at time 
trial events are typically the fastest cars.  GT-2 914s(approx 300 hp) can 
generally chase down all except the highest horsepower (500 hp+) 911's.
    
So, before you get on your 911 high horse, you had better get out on the 
track, open your eyes, and speak only after you have some experience.

Well, Palm Springs was a blast!!  Let's see, for cars they had a 908-10,
a 908-02, a 917-10 (Hurley Haywood drove that car), alot of D-P 356's
w/911 wheels and parts, speedsters that were mostly 911's and some people from
the Porsche Owners Club were invited to run their cars (911 track cars).  They 
had a 911 that actually raced at LeMans in '76 among them.  And what a show
the 911 guys put on!  There was an exhibition class where a LolaT530 (driven by
Brian Redman on Sat.) and a GTP Nissan (driven by Morton) raced for the win
but the real race on Sat. and Sun. was for 3rd and 4th between the 911's, driven
by Jim Bouzaglou (#49) and Richard Raimist (#41).  These guys were all over each
other the WHOLE race, swapping positions on most of the turns.  By the way, both
were entered as '73 911's and they were turning faster lap times than Wayne 
Taylor in the Jag XJR-15, Augie Pabst in his Camaro or the Ferrari 512 BBL.
It was a sensory load!!  And the people were having fun.

How was the Zone 8 at the Murph?  How did the 928's do compared to 911SC's?

This is mostly Urban Legend.  A battery on a cold concrete floor will
not crank well, but upon warming it will be OK.  Still, if you leave
it in the car or on a wooden plank, you won't have that problem.

Check the coolant and make sure it is sufficiently strong for the
storage temperatures that the car *might* see.  Can't hurt to make it
a little glycol-rich... those cracked blocks really make a guy weep.

And wipe your handgun with light oil, so it'll be ready for spring in LA...

I think you missed the 1st half of the thread.  I wasn't the one who started
calling them VW's.  I just commented that if they were VW's, they were nice
VW's, with my tounge firmly in my cheek.

I also happen to be a big VW fan, air cooled busses especially, and if you'd
followed any of my posts over the past few months you'd pobably noticed that.

I really don't care who thinks which Porsche is best.  Opinions are like 
assholes....

I, for example, think my cars are the best in whole world.  Why? Because
they're mine!  I can walk out to the garage any time I damn well please
and rive one of them around the block, rather than the armchair discussion
of "I'd rather have a 930 or a 969" or whatever!

I am not a regular member of this list yet (meesage to Stan is on its

know that this SC is the one Porsche I'd like to (and will) own, since 
I have been around it for over 5 years (owner is a good friend and I 
helped hiim buy it the first time 5 years ago).  But, I just need to 
agree on price.  So here is what I know:
1964 SC red/tan
 - stripped and painted 4 years ago. slight rearend accident 6 months 
ago required new bumper and tail lens, but body has no bondo in the 
tail (it was worked back out) and never got close to the engine. no 
rust in the pan anywhere, dime size spots near antenna and lower 
quarter panel.
 - all records since new (3 owners).  Has alway been maintained in 
original state (including radio antenna etc.)
 - engine runs on 3 cylinders - unknown reason yet, but this is part of 
its appeal. Transmission is solid (all synchros are solid, no missing 
teeth).
 - Everything on the car works. Has been driven daily until engine 
mishap.

Please e-mail direct to brian.foster@ast.com and let me know what you 
think.
Also, since I am active with the BMW CCA, I know that there is an 
active PCA chapter in San Diego, CA; but is there one in Orange 
County?  How about reputable repair/service shop that does 
pre-purchase inspections?

Subject: Good bodywork books.  welding, rustoring, refinishing, etc.


Greetings all .

  In reviewing some of my books on body repairs, I realized how much 
unwitting quotation from them I have made.  I have one really good book and 
another that adds depth to understanding the art of welding.  Since we are 
in the season of more work on than driving in The Porsche . . .

  I hereby humbly offer the following:

'The Principles of Auto Body Repairing and Refinishing' by Deroche & 
Hildebrand
  cost:  approx. $35 U.S.  700 ppgs  (please note this is a shop study text)

'Welder's Handbook' by  Finch & Monroe
  cost:  approx. $15 U.S.  150 ppgs?

   In "The Principles . . ." book you will find the first 200 pages to be 
chocked full of the bodywork skills many Porschephiles will need to rustore 
a car, literally word for word.  In addition to the bodywork portion there 
are sections on TOOL selection and usage, shop setup, fiberglass repair, 
refinishing and plastic repairs.  (Tim Allen carping in background)

  In the "Welder's Handbook"  you will find a short dissertation on most 
types of welding technology; Mig, Tig, Arc, Gas.  There is also much 
information on methods of using the welding equipment in different 
situations and materials.  This handbook goes into slightly more detail than 
'Principles . . .' in that the scope is broader and the setup and use of the 
equipment is presented in greater depth.  Very little mention of bodywork in 
this book, but great if you are just starting an interest in welding.

  With these two books and a *lot* of practice and resolve, I went from 
neophyte to 'semi-pro'.

  Ok, one last message and I'm outta here..
  I can now say that my new $39 injectors work very nice, Oooh! indeed!

  The source is (and your gonna hate me for this) :  J. C. Whitney
  Mine are marked with a 'made in W. Germany' on the ferrules. NO Bosch 
numbers on 'em.
  They are identical in all other respects, including a cute little curved 
hoselet AND FI clamp.

  The Caveat:  you may get one that leaks around the hose ferrule or body 
but Whitney will make good on the deal.  Be sure to tell them the year model 
and displacement of your engine.

  My disclaimer:  I dont work for anyone car related,  Whitney is just

I also have been chasing a pretty sever vibration in my 914.  Have balanced
the tires/wheels (twice just to make sure), replaced the shocks/springs and
struts, checked/repacked the front wheel bearings, repacked the rear CV
joints and still the vibration exists.

==  Try swapping tires from front/rear, and if the vibs change you just need 
a rebalance.  Theweights ==may have flown off or came off somehow.
==  But this sounds like bad rear wheel bearings.  These are a joy to change 
out...

Same here, some days the steering wheel oscillates like an out of balance
fron tire and other days I can feel it in the seats like an out of balance
rear tire.  It seems to be worse around 60-75mph, can't afford to go faster
to experiment (driving record you know :-)

==This really does sound like missing balance weights.  You are not by 
chance using tire patch ==compound inside your tires are you?  Are all the 
bolts in the CV's?

If anyone has experience or suggestions I would much appreciate them.

Subject: 914 clutch problems
Date: Wednesday, November 16, 1994 1:23PM


I am a newbie to thet Porsche world, and I have encountered what seems to me
a major problem:  My clutch is slipping... bad.  I've talked to one mechanic
who tells me it's going to cost $1000 to replace the old one, and I don't
want to pay that kind of money.  I'm willing to work on it myself, but I
don't have much experience on auto repair.  For those of you out
there who have replaced clutches, is this a tricky procedure or is it
feasible for one as inexperienced as I to do it?  What special tools will I
need? etc...
Also, if it's not feasible for me to do the work myself, is $1000 a fair
price for this kind of work?

I'd appreciate any advice I can get.
thanks

  Hi guys-gals.

  In rumaging through my injection parts for 2 liter fours, I found this 
pressure sensor that is NOS!
It bears part number 0 280 100 100.  I cannot find this part in any of my 
914 parts lists.  My list covers all injected models of 914, but this sensor 
number is not even close to any of those in the list.

  Anyone got a better clue than I?

Greetings.

  This is of no benefit to me, but I pass it on to you 914 folk.
  (my crude version of practicing random kindness)

  Fiberglass rocker panels for 914's.
  Ecurie Engineering of Millwaukee Wisconsin makes a really nice set of 
fiberglass rocker panels that are laid up in a mold created from the oem 
steel originals.  They even have a little shadow where the screw holes were 
in the original part.  These sell for $80 a pair including shipping to your 
doorstep (North America).  They have a black gel-coat finish and dont 
require painting (but I give mine a shot of rocker paint anyway).  Tweeks 
and AA sell a nice mounting hardware set, but its a little pricey for a 
small handful of screws, nutclips, and plastic rivets.
  Ecurie also makes a fiberglass front and rear bumpers for 914's at $160 a 
pop.  I have not seen these, but they might also be a bargain after looking 
at used oem.  These guys are advertised in the Pano classifieds.

  Anyway I'm not connected with Ecurie, just a delighted customer.

  -long-
  I dont have any snap-on or mac or usag or??, but then, arent tools sorta 
like race cars in that it is the driver that makes the difference?  I'm a 25 
year veteran of wrenching (humping) cars.
  I use Sears Craftsman hand tools, always have.  Am on second set . . . 
first set was stolen.
  After 10 years or so, the screwdrivers do seem to lose their appeal (the 
handles get beat up and the blades dull).  So for $30 I go get another set 
of 18.  My only complaint is some of the plastic handles smell like baby 
puke!  I give my wife the old drivers for her tool drawer (after 
sharpening).

  I dont like what 8 or 12 point sockets do to fasteners, so I buy only 6 
point sockets.  I have never had one break, but i have started to eat the 
chrome off the edges of 'em.  Once, I was using a 6" X 3/8 extension for the 
*WRONG THING* and sheared it in half, then in quarters (well, I was applying 
about 450+ ft.lbs in shear force on a 914 rear disc rotor) It sacrificed 
itself not in vain.  A new 6" extension was $10 or so.   Oh, the socket I 
use for the 914 axle nut is a PROTO impact socket. with a 1/2" drive and 
Sears breaker bar with a 6 foot piece of cheater pipe. (hasnt let me down 
yet)
  I use a 3/8" ratchet for most of my current work (5 cars), and after 12 
years of use, the ratchet is starting to fill with gink and turns not as 
freely as it used to, boy if that sucker could talk . . . volumes!
  For torqueing fasteners I have both an older Sears and Proto.  The sears 
tops out at 150 ft.lbs. and the Proto tops out at 250 ft.lbs. (1/2" drive)

  I also use air tools, but mostly for body work.  These are a rag-tag 
collection of imported, far east origin tools.  I'm not that impressed with 
them because they seem to waste more air to do an equivalent job as the 
domestic makes.  In comparison, the unit cost outweighs the domestics by 
some margin.  I paid $55 for an angle die grinder that became an appendage 
to my right hand for the 4 years I have spent restoring two 914's.  It works 
ok, but is getting worn, I expect to retire it and buy another before long. 
 The cost of two of these is still less than one of the  equivalent domestic 
brands.  Both products are capable of being refurbished, and I may choose to 
do that on my Taiwanese tools.
 Dual action sander (DA), angle die grinder, drill, sheet metal nibbler. 
 These are powered by a single stage 5hp compressor with 5-7CFM @ 120psi. 
 There are many times I run short of air (30 gallon tank), but to get around 
that I add two ten gallon tanks to the receiver.  This gives an advantage to 
running long lengths (>50') of 3/8 od hose in that I can insert the tanks at 
the hose couplings as I daisy chain from the pump house to the garage, 
driveway, and etc.  This tends to maintain the 'burst' demands on pressure 
and volume at the tool, and give longer duration runs.

  Of course, without power tools one is lost to toil, so a range of weapons 
to employ in making  life easier (and keep carpal pain at minimum).  I 
really like the Makita 9514 depressed center side-winder grinder, one of 
these and a 'Brilliant' abrasive wheel can level weld beads in no time.  The 
abrasive brand UA (United Abrasives) dont last as long as the Brilliant 
stuff.  Makita sells abrasives for their grinders but its expensive, so I 
only buy their 60 grit 'flapper wheels'.  These will do your fingernails in 
short order; they are even better on body panels.  I have also used this 
tool to spin a steel 'cup brush' . . . this is a formidable combination on 
rust and paint on cars, houses, etc.
  Another handy do-er is a reversible drill with variable speed, Ive got an 
old skil drill I cant kill, and it gets used for spinning a 3M rust-buster 
wheel (sorta like a really gnarly brillo pad -on a steeck).

  This has gotten long again.  It's not the tools. . . it's who uses them.
   Hope it is of some use.

Subject: Anti-Theft Protection

State laws (and prosecutorial practices) vary somewhat on use of deadly
force. But this is true almost everywhere: if you shoot someone under
questionable circumstances, you are in for a very tense time. You MAY be
prosecuted, you MAY be convicted, and you MAY do time. Apart from all that,
there are such things as civil suits by the bereaved family (if you are a
good enough shot) . I'm not saying it's fair, but it's there, so before you
carry a gun in your car, ask yourself if you are at all times a stable and
sober individual who can think fast and use good judgment in crises. If you
have a good life and a good family, you have a lot more to lose than the guy
who steals your car.

Some free legal advice, so take it at face value.

You guys are just having too much fun while I'm working too hard...

The best Porsche ever built is the one you're sitting in at idle, at a 
stoplight, when some 17 year old punk in his Dad's Mustang makes a 
decision he'll regret... :-)

Yes, I'd take the life of a scumball who was taking my property. It is 
sad that we should have to come to that though.

Onwards to the technical;

A note for fellow 928 owners: on my '86, I had an annoying noise the 
other day, coming from the driver's side door. I'd heard it once before, 
kind of a hum, followed by a pop. For whatever reason, I looked at the 
voltage guage and saw that it was being pulled down during the "hum" and 
popping up on the "pop". A few "what the's" and "@&#^$" later, I found 
that the power window switch for the driver's side was stuck in the 
'rocked forward' position, which essentially was keeping the motor 
engaged, I guess. Rocked the switch, noise vanished, voltage guage went 
steady.

One more fun item; should a fairly non-mechanical person attempt to 
replace the rear hatch "shocks"? Mine won't even hold the hatch open 
anymore, no less raise it when I trigger it. Any opinions or experience 
are more than welcome.

That's about all for now! I second Stan's advice to go hug your car and 
let's get on with business. Thanks.

Small cars for china#

This is very important work

If we wana carry on being conspicuous consumers ie drive our gas guzzlers

we have to encourage porsche to produce people wagons that use the 
absolute minimum of juice.

100 mp usg max consumption

These cars should also use the latest in high tech - kevlar bodies
mag alloy and titanium - this of course being in the interest of making 
sure that only the chinese elite can afford them.

The thought of 1000 million chinese porsches is quite mind blowing

I can second that Allan. I had a broken bolt into a very expensive to replace
pin in the caliper of my VW Corrado, and the aforementioned bits came to the
rescue. It was my first broken bolt extraction, so I just bought the most
expensive drill bit Sears had--guess I "chose wisely" (obscure reference to

worked.

I seem to recall that the bits were golden in color...Hmmm.

It's pretty easy - prop the hatch open, and look closely at the little
ball joint ends of the struts. There is a little wire clip which has a
straight portion that goes through holes in the socket to retain the
ball, and a circular portion that goes around the foot of the socket
to hold itself in place. Just remove the clip at either end of the strut
and take it off! Reassembly is the reverse...

over the years I have seen several oil pressure drops due to ends, only 
one minor drop pump related and none pressure guage related

Subject: 931 oil pressure drop: why?

Item for the collective wisdom of the P-philes:

My '80 931 oil pressure recently dropped, as read by the dashboard
guage.  Where the pressure used to be 4 or 5 bar (highway, 2500rpm,
warm), it is now in the 1.5 to 2.5 bar... making me EXTREMELY nervous
about driving the car at all.

What might be the prime suspect?  I can think of three possibilities:

1) Oil pump (yikes! I hope not)

2) sump intake/screen (40k+ miles since I dropped the pan :-( )

3) Oil pressure sender.

How might I tell the difference?  My idea is to check the most
available solution first: drop the pan, clean the intake.

Ideas/advice??

Subject: RE: 924's and winters

I've been driving a 924 year round since '82: 82-86 in Colorado and
>86 in Boston.  They do have a few attributes that make them good in
winter: 185mm tires are thin enough to cut through snow (in CO, I used
studded snows, here I don't bother), 50% of weight over drive wheels
for traction, 85% of weight is either at the very front or very back
meaning it has a high polar moment of inertia meaning it's less likely
to spin (think of an ice skater with arms stretched out), rear-wheel-
drive so no torque steer and it's easier to recover on ice.  In my
experience, the one thing that occasionally gets me is deep snow.
With limited ground clearance, I've found myself with enough snow
underneath to keep the wheels from tounching earth.  So I carry a snow
shovel for emergencies.  By the way, heavy snow chains fit just fine
(in Colorado they won't let you drive in the mountains without 'em
sometimes).  _MS

I don't believe K-Mart allows you to return the tools to the store like 
Sears does.  Sears Craftsman tools has one of the few user friendly 
warranties.  I wanted to add that if you are a student who can somehow 
show an affiliation to a school, you can get a 10% discount on Sears 
Craftsman tools.  Sears tools are all ready very reasonably priced but 
this makes it even nicer.  The Sears salesperson will try to get you to 
join a Sears Craftsman club if you are a student, teacher, etc.  As a 
club member, once every six months or so they will have a special sale 
just for club members.  I am not in anyway associated with Sears or 
Craftsman, I just buy the best tools I can afford, which is usually 
Craftsman.

I should also mention that WalMart has started selling Popular Mechanics 
tools with the same "return to the store" lifetime warranty that Sears 
Craftsman has.  I've never used any Popular Mechanics tools, though.

I wasn't there this year, my car wasn't ready, but I race in the VARA DP
group on a regular basis and I believe you are mistaken here. The 356's in
this group run 911 wheels because they are light and legal and usable with
356C brakes/hubs(which are also legal). Other than that, 911 suspension,
trans, engine, etc are completely illegal by VARA rules and I've never seen a
356 North of the Carrera Panamerica allowed to run any of these components.
Could be they relaxed some rules for this event though, it's been done
before.

Does anyone know how many 930's are in the US?  One can probably ask PCNA

here between 1980-85.  Is there a 930 registry?  I do realize from the
recent discussion of these cars that their large production numbers prevent
them from being collectibles, but I am interested in reaching other owners
to discuss common problems.  There are few articles which cover these models
(especially the 85-89 models).  Also, does anyone know the reason why the
new Zimmerman book dropped the 930 all together?  Does he know something we
don't?

In a recent magazine Q&A,  Bruce Anderson commented on the merits of
aftermarket exhaust systems (Monty, B&B) which I interpreted to suggest that
they would improve turbo response.  I noticed that the stock exhaust is fed

Subject: Pursang


Hi all,


In this thread about the legitamacy of automobiles, there is a term used
that originated from the horse set. Pursang, as related to me it means 
"pure-blood". I understand that Bugatti used this term to describe the 
fine pedigree of his automobiles and degrade his competitors. 

In this day an age, there are some fine components available just for the
right smart engineer to include in his world-beating sports or GT car. He
would be a damn fool to spend more money than necessary to accomplish his
goals unless he was building the Vector. 

The genius of Ferry Porsche and his staff was to use these raw materials 
to build a finer automobile than the source. Colin Chapman of Lotus, 
McLaren, Elva and even Ferrari used this method. They certainly did build
exclusive models with purpose-build components, they were also priced
accordingly. The Corvette would not exist if it did  not use as many 
production components as it does, as an example of GM thinking.

The thing that continues to amaze me is the relatively low cost Porsche
is able to introduce a new model for. They will spend around $300M to
do the 986. Much of the car will be new, some older pieces redesigned for
the new model. This is peanuts compared to the $6 billion Ford just spent
on a mundane 4-door sedan.

Which one is better? They are all damn good. Split a hair and enjoy the
one you have.

I saw the article and faced the same decision a couple in the Spring of 1993.
From what I recall, my estimates were about $2,500-3,000 to put in a 914
motor built to my requirements. That figure was for parts and machine shop
costs only with all other work performed by me.

I disassembled the 912 motor and found the case and crank to be in very good
shape. That put the cost of rebuilding the long block in the $1,500+ (I don't
recall, exactly) range for parts and shop work. I allowed another $1,000 or
so for carbs, exhaust and other incidentals. So I figured $2,500 for the
original to be rebuilt. I went with that option and came in at budget. I've
have had no cause to regret the decision and cannot make an educated comment
on the 914 powerplant in a 912.

The local PCA branch (LPR) had a 944 tech session at CT Automotive this

that there 4 different types used, the latest being about a year old. All 
new mounts for 944's are I think the same, with much less fluid and more 
rubber in the mount than previously. The new mount should look quite a bit 
different from the older type, and not just a different colour rubber 
section.
The right hand mount is a common failure point, probably due to heat damage.

I am not a regular member of this list yet (meesage to Stan is on its

know that this SC is the one Porsche I'd like to (and will) own, since 
I have been around it for over 5 years (owner is a good friend and I 
helped hiim buy it the first time 5 years ago).  But, I just need to 
agree on price.  So here is what I know:
1964 SC red/tan
 - stripped and painted 4 years ago. slight rearend accident 6 months 
ago required new bumper and tail lens, but body has no bondo in the 
tail (it was worked back out) and never got close to the engine. no 
rust in the pan anywhere, dime size spots near antenna and lower 
quarter panel.
 - all records since new (3 owners).  Has alway been maintained in 
original state (including radio antenna etc.)
 - engine runs on 3 cylinders - unknown reason yet, but this is part of 
its appeal. Transmission is solid (all synchros are solid, no missing 
teeth).
 - Everything on the car works. Has been driven daily until engine 
mishap.

Please e-mail direct to brian.foster@ast.com and let me know what you 
think.
Also, since I am active with the BMW CCA, I know that there is an 
active PCA chapter in San Diego, CA; but is there one in Orange 
County?  How about reputable repair/service shop that does 
pre-purchase inspections?

He would have mentioned, had his mind not been filled with, no doubt, nobler
things, that "Pursang", as it has been used since the days of good ol' Ettoire, 
has been exclusively applied to those automobiles recognized as pure sports 
cars.

> Which one is better? They are all damn good. Split a hair and enjoy the

(what he said)

Examples of Pursang include assorted British (curses, the prince of
Darkness strikes again) models, mostly no longer among the living [e.g.,
MGs Triumphs (TR2, 3, 3a, 4, et al)] the noble Loti, Porsche [models no
longer produced, e.g., 356, 550, 914; and ] 911 series, various Jaguars

miscelaneous Italian marques, as well as, believe it or else (oops, make
that "not"), Ford (can you say GT-40, GT-350 or Cobra), and Chevrolet
(Corvettes).

Except for the 911s or the 348 Ferarris (Well, you can argue for the
McLaren or the Lambos or Bug'ers, but this is *my* little bit of raving, so
you can just go sh*t in yer hat - Bthpffffffhgt!) but *they* don't make the
cut.

Why not?  Ahhhh Ha! How good of you to ask!  'Tis because they don't offer
an *Open* model. Other Porsches are *Wonderful* cars, and I'd be happy as a
pig in sh*t to own *any* model.  Nevertheless, as I grew up with the term,
(allright, beeee *picky*... but I'm allowed a *weee* bit of artistic

I just recieved a catalog in the mail from Griot's Garage containing upscale

be worth it. Does anyone have any experience with Facom tools?

The catalog also has diecast model cars including a 993 Super Cup

Their number is 800-345-5789 if anyone is interested...

Just a little advice, FWIW: be careful! The rear hatch (and the front hood,
for that matter) are heavier than they look! Be sure to have adequate support
that won't slip and let it fall on you, break the glass, scrape the defroster
grid off, etc.

Also note that the new struts need to be compressed slightly to fit in, and
that struts strong enough to hold up the hatch require a lot of force (sorry,
don't have time to calculate it) to compress.

The nasty scenario is: you prop up the hatch (with 2x4s, or something
strong), and while compressing the strut to fit it to the body fitting, raise
the hatch so that the prop slips out -- you can make up your own ending.

(The foregoing would never happen in _my_ garage...I just have a vivid
imagination!

Thoroughbred may be closer. The intent is blue blood. Bugatti's cars were
exactly that: blue bloods. Not built to anybody's standard other than
Bugatti's. Like that other great iconoclast, Ferrari, Ettore Bugatti

never would he have considered any volume production car as pursang.
He would have included the Alfa Romeos of his day (they were his
greatest competition) and the Ferrari's of today. Perhaps Maserati in
the 1950s. Maybe the reincarnation of Bugatti -- having seen their
factory, it reflects the correct Bugatti obsession.

Subject: Turning Brake Pistons




I've never heard of doing that.  Sounds nutty.  I can't see
why turning the pistons does anything to extend pad wear.  Also,
some Porsche's (mine, at least, a '72 911, and maybe all 911's,
I don't know) require the pistons to be oriented in a certain way
to prevent squealing.  Wouldn't want to turn them, except 360
degrees...

     Do you guys know anything about "turning" the pistons in the calipers
     when you change the pads?  I heard that it extends pad life.  Is this
     true?

You only turn the piston to orient a cut-out (step) in the piston to
its nominal angle.  For example, in 2.5 litre aspiro 944's, the
cut-out should be at an angle of twenty degrees to the bottom
edge of the pad.  This minimizes taper wear.  On other 944's,
the cut-out should be parallel to the pad's bottom edge.

The angle varies greatly depending on the model.  In particular,
it depends on whether the calliper is in front of or behind the axle.

Subject: re: 944 fog lamps

Thanks to those who replied regarding my question of the legality of the rear 
fog lamps for a 944. My suspicion that they might have been illegal came 
about when I first came to USA from England and lamented the lack of high 
intensity rear lamps during a particularly foggy trip up to San Francisco. 
"Not allowed" said a supposedly well informed source. I have done a little 
more research that may be of interest (this applies to California- YMMV).

Rear foglamps are ok provided that they can only come on with the headlights 
and have a separate switch. The Cal vehicle code goes on to say that the 
the lens must be at least 4 inches away from the lens of any 
stoplamp. This may explain the removal of these lights on the USA 944.

However I can't find any similar requirement for regular stoplights so you 
can decide what to call the lights after you wire up the dead space on the 
rear cluster!

Given the tendency (reported on P-files recently) for the police to pick on 
Porsches, it may be wise to minimise the opportunities for attracting 
attention. Howver I would prefer to be seen and safe.

This does not seem like a good idea. With my aluminum "S" calipers, there is
a special casting in the piston where it goes against the pad. This must be
lined up at a specified angle when the piston is put into the caliper. I
guess it is to push the pad at the right angle. At least this is what the
manual says. If you rotate the piston the angle will be wrong. If anyone
knows different, I'm sure we'll hear about it...

Some 'murikan cars require that you do this; some PacRim cars require that
you basicly screw the pistons back into the calipers with wierdo speecial
tools. Your P-car *USUALLY* (like all the cars I work on, so if yours
has water in it other than via roof/window leaks, this may not apply)
has a *SPECIFIC* piston orientation, and requires a Special Tool to
correctly align the cut-out in the piston rim prior to reinstallation of
the caliper.

Interesting historical note: in the Old Days, ATE caliper rebuild kits
came with sort of a pressed tinfoil version of the tool, disposable
rather than long-life. So many folks out there never bought the tools.
These days, that's not the case, and you need to order one if you want 
to get it right. While I used to more-or-less eyeball it, I finally decided
that it was worth the investment in Yet Another Special Tool. I *THINK*
that there are only about 4 to cover all of the air cooled cars...

Well, Elmer Fohey gets $1000 plus outside machining/services, plus
parts, for  a 356/912 rebuild. Fully done, with powder coating on 
the sheet metal that can take it and fresh paint on those that can't,
new decals, and the "routine" stuff replaced, is about $2500. (there's
about $300 in bearings and $400 in gaskets and seals alone) If
you need pistons and cylinders, that can vary -- sometimes we can
get good used, rebalance, and go, sometimes you can even find a
set of NPRs unused for about $350 or so, there's the Shasta pistons
you can put in overbored stock cylinders, and there's always stock Mahle
for between $900 and $1600 depending on how lucky you get. If this is
your first rebuild, you *MAY* even get away with reusing the old ones.
Elmer starts by cleaning then beadblasting then cleaning the pistons, 
*THEN* measuring them. 85% of the time they're reusable. Worst case
is you need pistons/cylinders *AND* a crank *AND* an align bore *AND*
head work, in which case total cost can jump up to over $7k (which is
of course what my engine needed; even at cost on the parts and labor,
it was still painful...)

THER IS NO PROBLEM with 912 engine parts availability. Nor is there 
likely to be.

On the power issue, using a slight performance grind, you can get
110 HP on that old 1600cc engine... I have a slightly hotter 
cam, for about 120 HP in mine (356SC).  Just the NPR kit will 
give you about 100 or so -- the 912 is down to 90 HP from the 95 HP
that the 356SC had.

On the other hand, if you put in the Type IV 914 engine, you'll
also need to change the rear torsion bars, rebalnce the car, probably
change the front sway bar, and if you live in CA, you'll have
to install the EFI instead of carbs, which means you'd have to use
the 912E parts which are truely NLA (while the 912 was a long time ago,
there were a LOT of them, plus 80k+ 356s, versus the about 1200 912Es).

I'd STRONGLY encourage you to stay with the stock engine, or at least
with a slightly modified 912 engine...

It's a standard part from VW, Stoddard has been know to have them since
they decided that 914s fit their "vintage" orientation, and you can also
get them from salvage yards sometimes (not real damn likely since someone
would have to split a case to get to them...)

I wouldn't use them. Get a parts selection from Wurth. I know that 
Imparts has a "most of the fasteners the average guy needs" selectino
for about $50; if you buy by the drawer from Wurth, you're looking at
about $250 in screws and bolts, but that should last a LONG time.

Subject: Vibration at 70mph

I have a 69 912. At around 70-80mph I get this pretty strong vibration 
through the steering wheel. Go ahead tell me that the tire need to be balanced,
but I just put on new tires and rims and they were balanced correctly. To go 
one further I put a rear tire/rim forward as well, same thing. New ball joints
just done as well. Maybe a bad tie rod end?? Or a bad wheel bearing? I'm gonna
check these items out but other opinions are welcomed. Thanks for the help.

I've got a pair of 914 trailing arm stiffeners that I'm never going

starting to carry.

I'm willing to entertain any reasonable offers.  If someone in the
San Francisco bay area has the special bearing puller that lets you
pull the rear bearings in a 914 without messing up the alignment,
and was willing to help me change the rear bearings in my car, I

Dear Ed:

       Thanksf or the Datum Point- my experience exactly with Syntec 5W-50,
except that the oil pressure when hot didn't change from the 20W-50 Pennzoil.
In fact, after 3000 miles, the Oil Pressure with Syntec was HIGHER than with
Pennzoil at that mileage.

(I too have a BMW- a 528i, 1980.) I'd also recommend that you change the
Syntec at 1000 miles (or so), as I found a 1/4 inch of crud at the bottom of
the filter can at the first change with Syntec. It really clean out the crud
in your engine.

German air cooled flat four engine, all forward gears synchronized,
gets reasonable gas milage, and that's about it... *NOT* what you'd call 
a lot of similarities.... If he wants to do "lots of work" on a 914,
and have any hope of doing it right, he'll need the factory manual
set ($350 or so) and some special tools. If that number scares him,
then he needs a different attitude FIRST, because there's nothing
cheap about owning a 914. Unless you buy a perfect car and then
never drive it, whatever amount you buy the car for will be doubled
in the first three years if you try to put it into good shape,
drive it, and possibly autox it.

Brett Johnson's book "The Porsche 914: A Restorer's Guide to Authenicity"
is a good place to start. That way you can at least tell if you're getting
most of the right parts on the car...  There's only one body rot problem 
area, the whole car... they all had rust on them coming off the boat.
The *EXPENSIVE* problem is the right rear suspension console. Anything else
can be fixed under a kilobuck. In fact, in TX, it's common to be able to
fix ALL of the body rot and repaint the car for under two kilobucks
(not a bad idea, you see...)

> Short of going to california, are we likely to be successful

Sure, you don't have to go all the way to CA, you can probably stop in 
AZ or if you're really lucky NM or CO...

There are a fair number of good cars out there. It's unlikely that you'll
find one in the "daily driver" category  in your neck of the woods. 
Expect to pay at least $5k for a nice, solid '73-4 2.0 -- that *IS* the
car of choice. On the other hand, a nice, solid '74 1.8 can probably
be had for $2-3.5k since it's "less desirable" but can turn very respectible
performance (just ask some of the 2.0 guys that Tad Haas has embarrased
in his 1.8...)

If your friend is serious, have him shoot Phil Van Buskirk a note
at "pmletter@aol.com". Phil publishes the Porsche Market Letter, which
is a very good source of Porsche "want ads" from around the country.
Also consider joining the 914 Owners Association, not only as a source
of good info on the cars and want ads, but because it's the right
thing to do. And once you have the car, join PCA, of course.

No shit... OK, look:

1) if you're reasonably careful (i.e. don't drive into Known Bad Areas in
   the middle of the night, etc) you're probably OK. The main thing is
   *CONSTANTLY* be alert to what's going on around you, in particular off
   to both sides and behind you.

2) if you have a gun fetish (and here I thought you people used the Porsche
   as a penis extender, guess I was wrong.. 8}) ) you need to check with
   you local law enforcement agencies as to what's legal. In general, 
   places in "the west" tend to be a lot more liberal, and places that
   have been "civilized" longer tend to be more restrictive.

3) if you have a gun, don't fuck around with it. It's an antipersonel weapon, 
   not a threat management tool. Do not pick it up unless you know -- YOU
   KNOW -- you can kill someone with it and are willing to live with
   this. Do not fire warning shots. Do not *EVER* say "I'll shoot if you..."
   If you can not do this, find another way to deal with your fear or need 
   for satisfying whatever macho thing drives you.

4) most people should not even think about carrying a gun. However, if 
   you *MUST* carry, seriously consider the Lethal Force Institute's
   practical combat courses. Sort of like Skippy School for guns. Only
   better.

And no, I won't swap "war stories" out here, except to note three things:
(1) a carload of minority gang members in a Corolla really have trouble
keeping with a 911 they try to carjack, (2) .45 ACP -- there is no
substitute, and (3) yes, I DO shoot better than I drive...

Actually, I think Elmer's are too high... I know that I can get the
sets for less from Zims and, for that matter, you -- for a change!
But he likes this one particular manufacturer's stuff, which he
gets from one particular place. Shop cost is high, he keeps none
in stock (and we all know that buying in bulk greatly reduces
prices), so retail price is high. On the other hand, I've never
had any trouble with them, so I don't worry about it too much.

Leading to a seminal issue for porschephiles: is it worth pissing off
your wrench to save a few bucks? My answer is almost always no.
But then, regular readers know that....

IMO, it isn't.

If you use a battery charger, you'll have to disconnect one
wire of the battery.  Otherwise, for most of the car, a
certain amount of the electrical energy will go to the
alternator and the electrical regulator.  And finally will
destroy it (it is not design for this use).  It can damaged
other very expensive parts of your car (alarm?).

You will also generate explosive gases (hydrogen) because
of the acid contained in your battery.  Remember to always
open the battery when you use a charger.

I don't know what the battery will do after having exhaust
all its acid.  Obviously, won't you have an explosive garage
with a working battery charger in it... ?

My BMW owner's manual is very explicit about storing a car
for winter :

 - fill up the gazoline tank (to avoid corrosion),

 - fill up the acid of the battery at 5mm up the metal part
inside the battery with pure H2O - don't the english name
for it but avoid Perrier, Evian or other stuff.

 - remove water for your windscreen washing-device (hope you
still understand me),

 - fill up your radiator with non-frozen water,

 - put your gear-box in neutral (especially if it is an
automatic gear-box),

 - unlock your parking-brake,

 - lock one tire to avoid the car of it's need to follow the
universal law of gravity,

 - you can over-pressure your tires (twice the normal
pressure).

For the battery, it is said that you should remove it if
your garage's temperature may be under 0 celcius degree.

Charge it, and don't touch it till next spring.  That's all.

That is what I did when I let my car in my parents garage
during 6 months without using it.  It runs well, thanks.


Spend a nice winter,

Pierre F-F.

NB: think about the thief that will have to come back with
a brand new battery to steal your car !  If it's a 928,
hope he have a truck battery.

Hye, all of you Pdrivers ...


Just some news from France.  I read that some of you proud
new 993 owners like coming in Germany to get their new car
and drive it in Western Europe.

BUT BEWARE THE HIGHWAY COPS IN FRANCE.

As you might already knows, speed-radar detector are
*stricktly* forbidden in France (and their frequencies are
different too).

In France, here are the speed limits (in km/h !):

                                     Sunny     rainning
                                    weather    

In towns, small-towns and villages     50         50

Plain roads                            90         80

Double road (2x2 lanes)               110        100 ?

High-ways                             130        110


The parliament voted last week a brand new law concerning
high overspeeding:

30 km/h overspeed in towns
40 ...            on roads
50 ...            on highways


It costs a lot ( 7500 Frs = $1500 ), and a possibility of an
entire free month hollidays in our jails !!!

I can check, if someone is enough interested, if this
should also been applied for non-european drivers.

So, exceeding 180 km/h on french highways can be a great
experience if you are preparing a PhD about jails across
Europe.


Have a good day,

Pierre F-F.

Hello, Andre,

What you need is an alignment by someone who knows that you have to do the 
alignment with the wheel in the centered position.

By removing the steering wheel and realigning on the splines, you can get it
within about 5 degrees, but usually not exact.

Good luck,

Subject: CA man killed - 1986 Turbo missing


This is out of today's San Jose Mercury News -- FYI everyone...


BODY FOUND ON BEACH WAS CONTRACTOR'S

A Northern California building contractor who drove to San Francisco to sell
his Porsche has been identified as the man whose body was found by a passerby
on Pescadero Beach in San Mateo County last weekend.

Investigators are looking for the car and for the man who told Lance
Christopher Burgess he wanted to buy the car.

He had advertised the red 1986 Porsche Carrera Turbo for sale in the San
Francisco Chronicle.

The car is valued at $41,000, but Burgess was asking $39,000. He wanted to
sell the car to finance the purchase of land to build homes, San Mateo County
sheriff's Sgt. Ray Richardson said. The Porsche's license plate is 3HBP909.

Coroners have not yet determined what killed Burgess, 33, who is survived by
a wife and two daughters in McKinleyville, a town north of Eureka in Humboldt
County. Toxicology tests will be conducted.

Burgess' wallet and credit cards were missing from his clothing.

Police said a man identifying himself as half-owner of the Sheraton Palace
Hotel in San Francisco arrived at Burgess' home in McKinleyville last
Thursday to test-drive the car.

The two met at the Red Lion Inn in Eureka, and the prospective buyer, a man
in his 50s, said he wanted to buy the car but asked that Burgess bring it to
him at the hotel at New Montgomery and Market streets in San Francisco on
Friday.

Burgess left McKinleyville on Friday morning to deliver the car and was to
meet his wife and business partner in the Sacramento area later that day,
police said.

When he did not show up, they called the hotel. Employees there told them
they had never heard of the man who represented himself as one of the hotel's
owners, police said.

His family reported Burgess missing. The next morning, his body was
discovered in the surf.

Burgess had a distinctive tattoo on one arm -- a heart with wife Teresa's
name -- and that helped with his identification.

He was a motorcycle racer well-known on the motocross circuit, friends said.

Investigators would like to talk to anyone who may have seen Burgess or his
car. He was white, 5 feet 7, of stocky build, with brown hair and blue eyes.
He was wearing jeans, a T-shirt and a baseball cap.

Anyone with information is asked to call Sgt. Richardson at (415) 363-4060 or
the sheriff's department at (415) 363-4911.

To the best of my knowledge, all of the "good" stuff was ummm, 
"consumed" racing... There may be some stock at shops that ran
962 until the very end. You'd have to check around the old GTP circles.
Klym up at FabCar might have some, Dyson had some boxes that were labled
"962 spares", Brumos probably has some...

> Who would like to buy some?  

Well, considering that it's not legal for anything except PCA club racing,
and that a tub with spares is about $150k and a ready-to-run setup 
is more like $350k, and that you can buy a 3.8RSR with LOTS of spares
for about that, the answer is probably "nobody". Oh, there are some
collectors that will want them, and some of the guys running 911s in
SCCA GT-1 need some of the 962 parts, but in general, this is not likely
to sell like hot cakes...

 Well I knew that was goofy, and when I think about it, I've got a few other 
Special Tools also.  I was just trying to get something else started (too
much 914 stuff lately).
 I'm not talking about going through the factory manuals (I've got them, does 
that count as a Special Tool?) and buying every special part #. For that 
matter, I'm not even interested in anything engine- or transmission-rebuild
related. What I'd like to know is, what are good "special tools" to have on 
hand to work on your "vintage" 911. Tools that are useful for general 
maintenance, reconditioning, etc. Anything up to the point of cracking open 
an engine or transmission. I'll leave that to the "real" mechanic who's got 
all the special tools and expertise on hand already. Maybe in the future when 
I've got more time, tools and guts myself...
  Sometimes the factory manuals aren't the last word either, for that matter.
Their special brake bleeding mechanism looks a lot like an Eeezi-Bleed, at 
least in concept.

I just bought a '79 SC this last weekend which has an "automatic heater

Usual cause of failure is the little plastic socket dooley that slips
over the ball on the control shaft. It pops off, and then while the
control works, it doesn't *DO* anything. Fix is simple, and while I
thought this was detailed in the archives, I can't find it off-hand.

Best source of info is the factory manual, as I recall having to use
it to re-adjust the actuator arm after replacing the little plastic
gizmo....

Then I guess you'd best talk about what sorts of things you consider
"general maintenence", because my perspective is I'll do anything up
to the point that something needs to be machined, then I start sending
it out. (time permitting, that is -- most of the time these days I wind 
up having someone else turn the bolts because I just can't spare the time)

Hi Peter,

According to Bruce Anderson's book, "Porche 911 Performance Handbook", the
911L was produced in 1968 as a successor standard 911 for the R.o.W.  The
"L" designating Luxury.  It had most of the features of 911S except that it
had the standard 911 engine.  According to Anderson, the reason for this
was for the stricter US emission laws.

I've seen one of these here in Santa Barbara but I was unable to talk to
the owner.  There were 11,610 of these models produced and as noted above,
it had the 130HP 2.0 liter engine of the '64-'67 911.

I'm sure others will shed more light on the 911L for you.

Like I said - he is making parts at *COMPETITIVE* prices.  Here is a
sample:

aluminum monocoque tub
     - complete and assembled               $20,000
     or
     - disassembled (pre-cut and bent)      $15,000
short tail body with lexan (rough estimate) $13,000
latest style front uprights (hub carriers)  $ 1,250 ea
centerlock hubs                             $   650 ea

His prices are *WAY* below your estimates.  So, is the answer
still "nobody"?  Maybe...but you have to admit - it would be a
fun toy!  :-)

Yeah, but while the prices you quote are interesting, that is barely
a scratch on the total cost of assembling or campaigning an effective 
racing car. And, it still does not change the fact that there is no 
venue in which the 962 is sanctioned as a competition vehicle -- except 
the PCA Club Racing series.

There *MAY* be some people out there that would buy a $100K ready-to-roll
962 for use in that series, but even if you assume total of about 1000
license holders, when you look at distribution of cars, and see who's
running what out there, there are VERY FEW "full competition" cars, the
bulk being in stock and improved classes. Hence, I'd guess that there
might be possibly a half-dozen folks with the means and inclination, clearly
not "enough" people to really make it worthwhile.

And anyone with a *REAL* 962 at this point is either hanging onto
it because there's no market, hanging onto it for sentimental reasons 
(Dyson comes to mind) or hanging onto it because they're collectors or
speculators and are waiting for them to appreciate in value "like the 
917s did" (no kidding, I hear this all the time... suckers!).  In any event, 
they either don't need parts or would want factory parts to "preserve the 
value".

Still, the $650 centerlocks are possibly exciting for some of the GT guys.
God knows thats a pile less than the stuff that's being used now... *IF*
anyone will believe that they're any good.

Not wanting to be a wet blanket here, just a realist. BTW, have him hunt
down Ken Partymiller -- he'll buy just about anything like this.

Now if he wanted to build a Porsche-powered WSC car...

I've owned a couple of '68 911L's(one a parts car), I'm not an expert on
them, but here's what I know to be true..
They are alot like a '67S without the S motor. They have vented brakes like
an S, but both of the ones I've had used Boge struts on the front, not Koni
like an S. The engine is the same 130hp 2.0 as you would find in 66/67 non-S
911's, the trans doesn't have MSX gears in 3rd,4th,5th position like an S. As
far as I could tell, the only thing lighter on a 68L than 67S are the window
frames which are chrome over aluminum rather than the chrome over brass found
on all earlier cars.
You may be thinking of the 911R which is very rare and was built by the
factory with fiberglass panels, thinner glass, and a 906 style motor among
other things. About 30 of these cars were built, with the first 3 or 4 having
67 style serial numbers(ie. 3xxxxx) and the rest having 68 style serial
numbers(ie. 118xxxx...). Most of them were carbureted, but I've seen one with
early mechanical injection..
Hope that helps,

Subject: 944 Clear Fluid Leak, Front Center

I've got a 924S (same as a 944) that is dripping a small amount of
clear fluid from both the auto. transmission in the rear( prob atf) 
and also , recently , from the front center. 

Recently done: changed atf/strainer. brake master cylinder abt
3 months ago, water pump 5 months ago.

The car is an 87 with 29K miles. It had 21K miles when I bought it
june from old folks who didnt know it would go over 3000 rpm. 

Now ATF is virtually clear and is used in the power steering. This 
means ATF thru radiator, power steering, and brake systems are all 
possibilities/. Fluid levels seem fine. Performance seems fine. 

However, if trouble is brewing, I'd like some hints. Also , ideas of
what stuff costs would be nice too. Porsche told me the rear leak was nothing
to worry about. The front one is new though. 

I'm sure others must be as astounded as I by the variance of repair cost.
Or maybe I should say the labor to parts ratio. Like a master cylinder 
which is bolt on bolt off and check out, is imminently reasonable. The
water pump is not. 

The a/c is not being used, so it can't be water from the compressor...

Dear Stan:

     Just out of Curiosity, which gasket manufacturer does  Elmer like?
(Ironically, my late Father's name was "Elmer" too.  Sadly, he died last
January 3.)
    I've used Elring, Reinz, Goetz and other gasket sets, and, always wanting
to Improve the Breed, was wondering which one he likes the bbest?
    (I have to buy BOTH Elring and Reinz to get a complete, proper gasket
set. Reinz sets do NOT have the Late '912 Isolated Mount Oil Cooler gaskets,
despite the claim on the front that they do! Elring does have the '68/'69 Oil
Cooler Seales and rubber donuts.
    Elring, however, supplies the earlier #4 Main bearing  oil passageway
gaskets with the smaller oil hole that's wrong for late engines. Fortunately,
Reinz has TWO of the  PROPER gaskets for #4 Main Bearing Oil Passageway ,
both with the larger hole.
    So, with one of each of those two gasket sets, I can make up a set that
fits ANY 356/912 engine 1955-1969 properly. (Note that neither gasket set has
the seals for the A/B fuel pump. Those you need to get from the Emergency
Supply.
   Likewise, the Pulley/Flywheel seals that come with the Elring/Reinz  suck
big time. The Flywheel  Seal from Reinz  is a Blue 36HP VW that gets hard
real fast and leaks quickly. The Black  Flywheel/Pulley seals in the Elring
kit are better, last a little longer, but still fail early. 
    The only Flywheel/Pulley Seal that works used to be the  Silicone
Flywheel Seal, but it's gone the way of the Dodo bird. The Viton Pulley seal
is much better than either Elring/Reinz pulley seal.
( Note Well that BOTH seals MUST be installed with Factory Seal Installers to
work right, and it helps to polish properly the sealing area on the hub of
the Flywheel and Pulley.) 
 And I agree that it is not nice to piss off either  the Easter Bunny or your
Best Mechanic.
KEEP THE 356 FAITH!

Dear Jim:

     You beat me to it! I was about to post the Story from the San Jose
Mercury about the poor guy who was killed when he drove to SF  to sell his
'86 Carrera Turbo!
    I read the Story this Thanksgiving Morning, and thought it would be
proper to post it to Porschephiles to warn people. What a good use for the
Internet. 1000 people know VERY quickly that there's a Carrera Turbo whose
driver is wanted for murder- and maybe the next time,  you'll be the one he
picks on!
    So, upon returning home after Thanksgiving day dinner north of Berkeley,
 at one point, behind a Red, Porsche Turbo (with a different license  plate
number,  not 3HBP909), I started to type the newspaper article into my
computer. After a minute I thought- NO, this is almost the 21st century- I
can access the Mercury News, download the Story, edit it and post it to
Porschephiles- all in minutes!
    Which is just what I did. Then, after editing it a bit, I dialed up AOL,
but before I sent it, I thought- "better check to see if someone else posted
the story."  Almost the last entry was yours- with the Story.  
    I'm very glad others thought the  Story important enough to post so

Hello all,
Well, finally I'd set this record straight: I will post this message 
every month, with updates and such.
First of all, due to the reports about how slow the Hungarian connection 
is I'm lookin' for a nice person with a big machine who'd be so kind as 
to mirror this site for those who don't have the time to deal with the 
Hungarian situation.
I'd always love to hear Your comments and contributions (I know that You 
have interesting cars so why don't let me know about 'em?), 'cuz that's what 
keeps this site alive.
I'd like to start a new section but it requires _lotsa_ contributions: 
vintage cars. I already have some pix but I will start it when you will 
send me around 50 original photos about your or your friends, relatives 
etc. pride&joy.
I will keep a version of the list of the car related mailing lists 
(auto.lis in the pub directory).
In the near future here you will found some Ferrari pix (250 GTO, P2/3 
etc.), a Jaguar XJ220 (courtesy of Bolko Rawicz) and other additions.
'Til then here is the latest index (if you'd like a fresh one, check out 
the index.txt in the pub directory).
Thanks for listening, good browsing,

Bye

Hello, Peter,

Foreign Intrigue (Michael Grishman - owner) has a very good reputation among
my PCA friends in the area.  I have also been known to buy some parts from 
Michael when I need a good price.

I also understand that he has a neat barn, filled with all kinds of
goodies...

Third good point in his favor, he is listed as a PCA tech inspector for his
local region.  Usually a good indicator that the local folks trust him.

Good luck,

Subject: 962 parts

 
Stan says
>in general, this is not going to sell like hotcakes.
 
Sure it will, Stan. In about 30 years when the 962 becomes eligible for
vintage racing.
 
>waiting for them to appreciate, "just like the 917s did"... (suckers!)
 
According to at least 2 sources (personal communication from Juergen Barth,
and Aichele's 911 book) Porsche built something like 150 of the 956/962s.
I have a book copyright 1986 that lists 49 chassis numbers, and that does not
cover spares and such, and the 962 was still a current car at the time with
more being built. Of the 917/30, they built 3, and all five still exist <g>.
So there is a big difference between the Group C cars and the 917 in regard to
rarity. The 936 is a similar story; I think three were built, but later
privateers built two more on 908 frames (I think 908); Joest? Kremer? Anyway,
at least one of the 936s in this country is not a real 936. And if I'm not
mistaken, there are more 917/30s out there than the factory ever built.
 
I don't think 962s will appreciate real fast; they're hot to trot but
there's no place to race. I suspect they will gradually depreciate
(considering inflation) and will appear on the market from time to time as
people who hold on to them realize there's nothing they can do with them
except hold onto them. It's sort of like old Indy, F5000, or F1 cars; if you
really want one, you can find one and you can afford one.
 
Phil van Buskirk probably knows more about this market. Phil?

Subject: Various - long

1) WSJ excerpt - Chinese Porsche - But can you put a V8 in it? 
2) MB, BMW, SAAB mail lists
3) Guns
4) Reverse lights

1) ........Another company in the running is Germany's Porsche AG, whose
prototype, dubbed C88, was developed from scratch in conjunction with Chinese
engineers. The curvy-lined C88 sedan won't set speed records: Its 50-horsepower
engine reaches 60 miles an hour in 22 seconds, a milestone of underachievement
for Porsche. But the maker of elite sports cars thinks sales could accelerate at
a record pace, to maybe 250,000 C88s each year. "It's a completely new dimension
for us," says Wendelin Wiedeking, Porsche's president ........Perhaps the
biggest surprise is the eagerness of luxury-car makers Porsche and Mercedes-Benz
to tap the low end of the world's biggest mass market. Like Porsche, Mercedes
went to the drawing board to come up with its "FCC," or Family Car China,
concept vehicle.
   The FCC looks like a squished minivan. It has a radically raked windshield,
huge square headlights and front wheels only a few short inches from the front
bumper. "We've developed a car with less exterior space and more interior space
than any in history," says designer Arno Jambor.
   The car stands eight inches higher off the ground than an ordinary passenger
car, making it possible to fit the small engine entirely under the passenger
compartment. That frees up room in the interior, puts the engine out of
collision range "and makes for unsurpassed safety standards," Mr. Jambor says.
He says Mercedes could build a three-cylinder, 1.3 liter FCC with local parts
and even antilock brakes for about $10,000 a vehicle. It would be the slowest
car Mercedes ever built and in relative terms the least expensive.
   Passers-by at the Mercedes stand liked the concept but remained skeptical.
"How much for that?" a 32-year-old construction-materials salesman named Zhang
Wenlong asked a Mercedes representative. When he heard the answer, he said, "If
you really build it here for $10,000, you will own the market."
   Some visitors to the exhibition also questioned whether the government's
concept of a "family car" applies to them. "Of course, everyone wants different
things in a car," said a clothing salesman, Ma Weiming. He admired one of GM's
Corsa sedans, fiddling with the stick shift, opening and closing the glove
compartment, and pronounced himself satisfied. "It's a strong-looking little
car. Maybe it could stand up to the abuse it would take from Chinese roads," he
said.
   But his own preferences run to the racy. "What about those big, fast cars GM
builds in America?" he asked. "Why don't they bring those here? That would
really be welcomed."

3) Guns - I live in NYC. It is not that hard to buy a handgun, legally or
otherwise. Just time consuming and expensive. You simply have to join a range,
apply for a target permit, wait a couple months for approval and buy it. A nice
loophole is to get an address just outside of NYC, where the town will allow you
to carry the gun to and from the range. If the range is open 24 hr; ie locked,
unsupervised, you have the key; then you can pretty much carry the gun all the
time. Getting a gun illegally without dealing with any bad guys is simply a
matter of going outside the city and buying one used from some private
individual. In my experience though, this is a bad idea. Many people (ie. other
kids when I was in high school) that I know who carried guns tended to use them
on other people eventually. Even if they never intended too when they first
started carrying them, and did it just for protection, or because the other guys
had them. Seems like if you start carrying a handgun, you basically take the
first step down the wrong path. Definitely don't have anything against owning
them, just carrying them. 

4) Anybody ever put those reverse lights that beep in their Porsches? Any
problems?

The above was a composite of my $.02 and various other sources. If you were a

Subject:      Electrical gremlins : 924/931/944...

Greetings.
After rolling on quite a few miles recently, my $931$$$$ has developed
a couple new *features* in the electrical system which *may* be related.
There is a reason why you see these cars advertised as "never been driven
in the rain", it's because the aging electrical systems --probably worked
out by ex-employees of Lucas :> , don't allow you to rely on the wipers
in particular, or any ohter electrical item for that matter ;-)
Now they should also stick in "never been driven at night".
My headlights have gone intermittent, and I have a voltage fluctuation
which may well be unrelated. Perhaps somebody else has had a similar
set of features and could save me some search time in figuring this out.

The headlights  randomly shut off. Only the headlamps themselves
are affected. It can happen when the car is sitting there idling, or
more interestingly on a darkened highway when an eighteen wheeler is still
beside you, but mistakes your flashing lights as a courtesy signal to
pull in :-/ In the past, simply turning off the switch and immediately
flicking it back on would restore the lights. Now it only comes on at
its own choice, when it is ready. I tried banging around the switch
and the wires connected to it, as well as a few well placed shakes of the
fuse panel, but that's about the extent of my *diagnostics* so far :^)
Oh I did try shaking the bejeesus out of the more suspicious looking parts
of the harness, under the hood, when I was forced to pull over. No success.
They turned themselves back on when they were ready, and actually stayed on
for the rest of the trip.

The voltage fluctations are probably an unrelated failure of the regulator,
but they cause the lights to occasionally get quite bright, and all the
fans and the fuel pumps etc. to change speed.

If anyone is aware of any *typical* wiring fault that causes either of these
features in the waterpumping pcars, please let me know directly, since
time constraints still haven't allowed me to resume my subscription to
pfiles.  I would appreciate any tips that would reduce the time required
to locate the gremlin. cheers.     ken.stanton@queensu.CA

Subject: Re:  930 owner's body found

I heard about this last Monday morning from my landlord.  He had met the
victim, and done business with some of his associates.  The story I heard, of
course, was a bit different, but it plays out the same.

"Buyer" flies up to Eureka in his private plane (if you don't know, look on a
CA map to see how far out of the way it is from SF), meets the late Mr.
Burgess at the hotel in town, agrees to buy the car if he delivers it the
next day in SF.  Note that no one has seen "buyer," either in Eureka or SF.
 Family gets worried late Friday and the next day the body is found, but no
car.

Shoes and socks were found on the beach (note, not in the story.) I was told
there were no injuries to the body.  The police suggested to the family that
the victim was instructed to walk ("pursauded" with a gun?) out into the
ocean where hypothermia would do him in.  I see that this is not publicized
either.

After the initial shock of hearing this sad story, something came to mind.
 This is an '86 930!  Something fishy about a "next day" deal, especially
when the price is probably $10K over market.  (Hate me if you want for saying
that, but I have 3 new customers this year who have bought nice '86-7 930's
for $23-29K.)  I suspect there's more to this story than meets the eye....

My '86 has the same sticky switch problem.  In my
case, it's not the switch's fault.  The interior
trim is too close to the switch and wedges the
switch in the on position.  The switch gets 
very warm after a while in this situation.

I found this problem after noticing the interior
lights dimming periodically.  I timed the period
(about 18 seconds, I think), then experimented
by turning the key to different positions to see
the effect.  I then used normal powers of 
observation to notice the rocker switch position.

The period is probably that of an automatic
cut-off for power to the window motor.

Subject: Re: 914 advice needed!


Dear Adam:

Good luck for your friend purchasing a 914. Many good examples are available
at reasonable prices, but I would certainly look south of the Mason-Dixon
line!

Exterior rust is obvious, but interior rust is not so obvious. I quote from
tech tip 364 from Dr. 914's Technical Tips Manual (c 1994 George A. Hussey,
IV):

364. Inner body panel areas prone to rust are as follows:

1. Front panel bumper mounting holes (70 - 74)
2. Rear bottom of front wheel wells
3. Rear of front inner wheel house near the cowl to fender seal
4. Battery tray
5. Bottom of rear inner wheel house at jack post and support
6. Jack post and support
7. Rear of threshold sill where it joins the rear quarter door jamb
8. The ends of the inner and outer firewall
9. The rear of the inside rollbar reinforcement
10. The back wall "x" stamping areas from a soaked '73 - '76 engine insulator
pad or leaking rear window
11. The inner rocker panel near the jack post and support
12. The right engine shelf and inner wheel house above the '70 - '74 fuel
pump mounting

Although there are many other areas that can rust, these are the most common
in a sound 914.

Dear Will:

The 914 headlamp beam adjustment (from the Haynes Manual) is as follows:

1. The screws on the top side of the headlight surround are the adjusting
screws which tilt the reflector horizontally and vertically.
2. Because of the many different local regulations and the increasing
argument about what is, and what is not, a correctly aimed headlamp beam, we
are not offering any advice as to where the beam should point, only how to
make it point in that direction. The actual focus point should be obtained
from your local dealer or police authority.
3. Having ascertained how the beam is to be aimed on dip, whether it must
swing to the right or left when dipped, and the measurements of the
displacement, set the car on level ground about 20 feet (6 meters) from a
vertical wall or door. The vehicle tire pressures should be correct and there
should be the equivalent of the driver's weight in the driving seat.
4. Mark with relation to the center-line of the car and the height of the
lamps from the ground, the equivalent positions of the lamps on the wall.
Using this information, mark the area to which the lights should be directed
on dipped beam. Cover one light and switch on. Using the adjusting screws,
direct the beam to the area required. Cover that light and repeat with the
other one.
5. When the beams are correctly focused on dip, the high beams will
automatically be correct.

You can get access to the underside of the switches by removing the
rug-covered side panels of the center console. They are held by one
phillips-head screw, and one snap fastener near the switch you're

Subject: 914/6 engine advice sought

Would anyone recommend a good mechanic's shop to assemble a 914/6 engine in
the SoCal area?  The engine was taken apart some years ago, all machine
work has been done, 95% of parts have been aquired, and the next step is
reassembly, which I want to have done professionally.

What I'm *not* looking for is a corner shop who has done a few stock 911
engines.  What I *am* looking for is an experienced shop who can say things
like "too bad you had X done to the engine, that's fine for racing, but not
so hot for street", or "it's a good thing you had Y done, since it prevents
Z from failing in 10k miles."  

Recommendations, please?

Yes, I did NOT try to imply that the entire engine setup is identical.
My point is: the block is the same.  

The heads (FI) are not the same as the VW heads (carb).  Obviously, the
fuel delivery systems are different, etc.

If (whoever started this thread) wants to run a VW engine, they can,
but they need to be aware that all of their Porsche parts are not 
going to bolt right on.

Subject: 944 belt rollers

I bought a 944 belt and roller kit from Zim's last week, and was
surprised by a number of things.  

1) The belt teeth are not completely rounded, but instead have a small
depression running longitudinally along the top of each tooth.  The
belts are made by Pirelli.  Is this a new design (to reduce noise, for
example), or is this just how Pirelli makes their belts?

2) The toothed eccentric tensioner rollers appear to be plastic,
whereas the originals are metal.  The part numbers are different than
those stamped on the originals, but the numbers on the new parts agree
with those called out in the Euroselect catalog and others.  I can
only assume that the originals were superceded at some point.
When was this?

3) The flanges on the eccentric rollers are 26 or 27mm wide, rather
than 24mm as on the original part.  The offset (bent, actually) wrench
that I have used for 7 years on two 944s is therefore useless on
these.

Did I get some "funny" aftermarket parts, or has the design of this
stuff changed behind my back?  I can always stop by the dealer on
Monday to see what they are selling now, but I'm curious to know
if anyone other netters have had experiences with this.

You *already have* a used one. Sure you want another???

It's just plain silly to try to save money by re-using some used parts,
in particular, things with wires hanging off of them... I highly
recommend that you only use NEW sensors, injectors, fuel pumps, etc.
For some reason, 914 brains don't seem to fail very often so used
brains are often OK....

Subject: 951 shifting problems


Recently my 951 has displayed the rather annoying trait of
apparently becoming stuck between gears.  This only happens
when I am stopped; it becomes impossible to engage 1st gear
from neutral.  It happens maybe once every 40 times.  I
eventually get it into gear by engaging, say, 5th, letting
the clutch out slightly (just enough to get the car move forward)
and then engaging 1st.  Otherwise, the clutch/transaxle
work normally.  BTW, when this occurs, I can't get it into 2nd
from neutral, either.  Is this a sign of impending clutch problems,
or perhaps misadjusted selector forks?

Subject: Strut spacers again

The spacer I'm referring to goes inside the bottom of strut tube and the
cartrige rests on top of it. They raise the cartrige, I believe 7mm. When I
replaced the worn out Konis on my '68 912 with Boges, I needed to use the
spacers (which don't come with the shocks, I had to order them separartly) in
order to have the cartriges seat firmly in the tube when the stop disk is
tightened. Why on earth a Boge cartrige needs a spacer to go into a Boge
strut is beyond me. Anyway, we're now working on a '67 911 replacing the Boge
cartriges with Sachs units that didn't come with any spacers (someone else
ordered them). Does anyone know if we need the damn spacers or do we have to
take the old ones off to see if the new struts are the same length? Just
trying to save a little work here...and maybe learn something. BTW, I talked
to a Bilstein rep. and he told me if you need the spacers, use them, if you
don't, don't...K.

Anyone have a door lock cylinder and gizz that screws to it for a 70-73

over time, rendering the square extrusion on the cylinder round as well as
the "female" square indentation in the "gizz". I've stated 70-73 because
research has led me to believe that these years used the trigger lock
mechanisms.

I used to just disconnect the battery, and then give a charge once a month
for a couple of hours with a 6-amp charger I own. Sounded good except that I
often didn't get to it regularly, and I lost at least one battery which had a
cell stop holding a charge, after it was allowed to go completely flat (and
it was a $110 Porsche battery one month beyond its 24 month warranty).

This year I bought one of the automatic chargers Sears sells (I think Solar
sells a similar unit) which has 2 and 10 amp rates, as well as a 60 amp jump
starting feature (just in case). The cool thing about this unit is that it
completely shuts off when the charge level is topped off, and then passively
monitors the voltage. When the voltage drops a certain amount, it turns back
on, and brings the level back up. Supposedly prevents sulfate formation on
the plates (due to low charge state).

The manual indicates that even a 2-amp continuous charge will eventually
cause boiling of the battery acid when the battery is fully (or over)
charged. This is attributed to the battery converting the excess energy to
heat, as it cannot accept a greater charge chemically in the plates.

As to ventilation, as long as the acid isn't boiled, I think my garage door
is leaky enough to prevent a dangerous hydrogen buildup. DISCLAIMER: All
lead-acid batteries give off explosive Hydrogen gas when charged!!

For 60 bucks, this should pay for itself if it ever saves me a battery. Plus,
it has a green LED which lights to tell you it has stopped charging. I'm a
sucker for indicator lights...

I was thinking of doing the same thing, but using a 1-amp charger that I have,
in conjunction with a lamp timer, so i could just run it for and hour or two 
each day.  (So's I don't forget!) How 'bout that setup?  I did this for a
few weeks on my SO's toyota she's trying to sell but not driving, and it
seemed to work OK.

Also, with my early 911, with 2 batteries, when necessary, I've hooked up
the charger to both batteries by hooking the + to one battery and the - to
the other, and leaving them connected to the car.  Is this right or wrong?

Text item: Text_1

Hi to All
Apologies, Thanks and repeat request.
My apologies for not responding sooner but things like earning a living and 
raking up mounds and mounds of leaves which passes for fun in this part of Ohio 
in the Fall have all taken priority.
Thanks to all who responded with suggestions for aligning Brake and Accelerator 
pedals on my '930'. My plan is to use a combination of adding second pedal 
platform and adjusting the brake pedal linkage down. Difference in height is 
such that foot position would be to high with just a block and I am concerned 
about running out of stroke if all taken out on the brake adjustment. Will let 
you know if it works out.
Disappointed that no one responded with advice on getting 'Seat Bits' for fore 
and aft adjuster, surely somebody has had to restore seats and have sources of 
parts - what about used car parts for example?
For Pete A, the understeer in my first really fun corner was not trailing 
throttle going in but plowing (ploughing for my Brit Buddies) like crazy when I 
applied power AFTER the apex. Apex was at that time defined by my ex Fiero GT 
however.

Following Larry W's recent lead I offer a bumper sticker aimed at all of those 
who will let neither the gun or the best model issue die (puns intended)
"The Paranoids are after me"--I actually saw this sticker.

Thanks to most for interesting net, and still dreading the turbo 'coming on' in 
the middle of the corner!

Well, what you should check is how the law pertains to non-French drivers.
The laws for a US-citizen would (most likely) be the same as for me who

Damn. And France has such nice "autobahns" too :-)

My experience is, though, that the police doesn't care much about speeding.
A couple of years ago I was driving to Cannes, humming along around 200km/h
together with a 928S when we passed a policecar. I was somewhat worried, 
but they didn't do a thing.

Last year when I was in Cannes, I didn't see a single policecar the entire
way through France. But maybe they are a bit more strict nowadays - I don't
know.

Interesting to know the rules about "jailbirding" for foreigners, though!

Folks,

I have a 911 alternator which failed when one of its brushes wore
too far.  The unit is marked "Paris Rhone" and comes out of a
mid-80's Carrera.  P/N is 911.603.120.05.  Except for the brushes,
the thing looks fine.  The commutator is about 50% worn, so I
figure that with new brushes, it probably is a good used part.

Questions: is this a Marchal alternator?  Is a replacement regulator
available for it?  (The regulator is integral with the brushes.)

Cabaniss is one of the nicer tracks in this end of the world, once you 
igore Texas World Speedway. It's commonly run in a configuration that has
a 5000 foot straight. That's right, nearly a mile. You can trim your
toenails while waiting for Turn One to come up! No kidding, there is a
large problem with people sort of letting their minds wander...

Anyway, so how many 'philes will be there? Send me a private mail, and

so I know the area reasonably well....

Subject: 944 Hatch noises

P-files:

A little over a week ago, Dennis Mitsch posted an item about adjusting a
rattling hatch on a 944. The hatch on my '84 944 rattles too, especially
now that the temperature has dropped, and I would like to know how make the
adjustments to get rid of the rattling. After all, I don't think Porsches
should rattle (at least not mine).

I should note that my car is presently running rough and in need of new
motor mounts, and that the hatch rattle is worst when the car is first
started, so this is partially a case of treating the symptom instead of the
cause (which is also being addressed). The rattle also occurs, however,
when driving over rough road, so it merits some attention.

While inspecting the hatch, I noticed paint worn (chipped?) off the car's
body where the latch mount scrapes against it. What I'm calling the latch
mount is the part on the hatch that the threaded stud screws into (the
other end of the threaded stud is the conical part that gets locked into
the part mounted on the car's body). The bare metal where the paint is
rubbed off is shiny and the rattle sounds as if it could be coming from
this kind of contact. My guess is that Porsche didn't design the car to
have these parts in contact and that they are the source of the rattle. Am
I right? How do I fix this problem? It looks like there are a few places
where adjustments can be made, but which one is the right one?

Thanks,
Con


P.S. Dennis: You offered to post a summary. Is there one to post? If so,
please post it or send it to me by e-mail. Thanks.

I can't be the first to be faced with this little problem and I've prepared
myself for a disappointment, but I'll try anyway:

On Nov 16, my wife and I had a baby boy.

Now how do I get both of them into my 944 without making my wife ride in
the back seat (won't be a very long drive if she has to sit in the back)?
Is there a type of baby seat that'll fit in a 944? We tried one brand and
it was hopeless.

Which brings up a related question. How do 944 occupants fare in accidents?
The car seems very solid, so I expect that the occupants would be fairly
well protected.

I'm sure you've dealt with these questions before, so please direct me to

Subject: VW parts.

p-files:

Somthing good may yet come out of that boring thread about which Porsche
was better or best. In the discussion, several people brought up the fact
that Porsche uses numerous VW parts in their cars. This brings up some
interesting possibilities:

In my admittedly limited experience, Porsche replacement parts are quite
expensive. If some of the same parts are available with VW part numbers,
aren't they less expensive when bought from VW? When Porsche uses a VW
part, do they assign their own part number? If so, is there a cross
reference available?

I'll can even expand the question a bit. Porsche must use many parts
off-the-shelf. My foglights, for example, have Hella printed on the lenses.
Is a cross reference available which gives the OEM part numbers and the
part numbers used by other makers using the same parts? Or are the parts
custom made for Porsche?

I'm sure that I'm not the first to ask these questions, but for what
they're worth, here they are anyway.

Just wondering,

Can anyone refer me to good reference material on the following:

2. Care of interior

I'm looking for practical tips and detailing tricks that experts use to
make a car look fantastic. I don't know what to believe from advertising,

their manufacturer's, they're all the best available. My hope is that a
bunch of fine car owner's, as you are, will really know what's best.

Here's a sampling of the questions I want answered:
 - What should I use to clean and treat the interior (Armor all?)?
 - What do I use to clean and polish leather seats, shifter and steering
wheel?
 - How do I get rid of creaks between parts rubbing together? (e.g. the
plastic surrounding the speedo and tach rubbing on the dashboard)
 - How do I take care of rubbe seals around doors etc.?
 - How do I remove the film of hard deposits left on the outside glass?
 - How do I apply touch-up paint and make it look as if it isn't there?
 - What do I do about dashboard cracks radiating out from the defroster
vents (which weren't there a year ago when I bought the car)? Can I fix
them? Can I at least stop them from growing? What causes them?
 - What type of wax is best for my paint? (White) Presumably the best wax

Not necessarily. I was recently shopping for a cold-start valve for my
Dad's 914. Something like $20 from the local Porsche dealer (which, BTW,
was as cheap as we found it via mail order: dealer prices for many parts
are actually "reasonable") - $35 from the local VW dealer...  The VW
dealer did not have catalogs for the 914, but was able to look up the
part/price based on the Porsche number.

from what I remember reading, the 944 evolved from a car that was really 
a safety exercise for porsche engineers, so I assume it is relatively 
safe... wish I could give you more details. 

Short anecdote:  I knew a guy who hit a pole dead-on at 40 mph, he 
emerged from the car without a scratch; the 944 did not.  it was 
totaled.  But there are lots of 944's, and only 1 him, so I guess it was OK.

Hi There
I know this isn't exactly the same, but file for future reference..
I have a two year old daughter and was faced with the same probem.
I couldn't fit a toddler seat in no matter how I tried and my local
dealer couldn't help despite the fact that a baby seat is shown in the
porsche possessions catalog that came with the car in 1987. I suppose
getting hold of one of these would be best. Does anyone else ever seen
one of these?  I could send anyone interested a copy of relevant pages
if wish to try a US or EUR porsche dealer..

Anyway here was my solution. I removed a five point harness from a baby
seat and fitted this to the bottom seatbelt fitting points(my car has
lap belts in the back..not sure if this was standard ?) The top of the
harness then passes through the seat at the folding point. I bolted the
belts to the floor of the trunk.  These are hidden under the carpets so
looks quite neat. My daughter now fits snuggly in the seat and is held
very securly by the harness.  Could be a good solution when your son
gets older..

As an aside I would be interested to hear from any other 924S owners if
there are any out there...

Subject: 944 throttle sticking


Hi,
   Now that winter is arriving here in New England (it's late this year)
I have had a winter-only problem with my older 944.  Has anyone else
had this problem?  Any guesses as to its source?

   When it is cold outside (at or below freezing, I think), and when the
engine is coming up to temperature (as the water temperature is heading
up to its normal band), there is a short period, maybe 30 seconds, maybe
2 minutes, where the engine throttle sticks.  So if I'm going along
at 3k RPM at just the right time, when I push in the clutch, the engine
stays at 3k RPM.  If I accelerate up to 4k RPM and take my foot off
the gas, the engine stays at 4k RPM.  
   Other than this single situation, the throttle never sticks.  I've looked
at the accelerator linkage, checked the idle microswitch, etc, but 
unless I can catch it during this short period, its hopeless.  
   Obviously this is dangerous, but it lasts only a short time.  I took
the car to the dealer a number of years ago for this, but they couldn't
find anything (obviously, it takes very specific circumstances for it
to occur at all).

   Now that I've written this down, it comes to mind one more important
fact:  I've got cruise control.     Hmmm.   Anybody heard any
problems about the cruise control turning itself on???

Thanks,
Dave Hempstead

Hi, Dave, 

Since you do not mention that the car runs rich or lean when this happens,
you have to assume that the throttle plate is being held open, or something
is simulating the throttle plate being held open.

Your cruise control could cause this.  To check, disconnect the cable to the
throttle body cam from the cruise.

The throttle plate might be binding in the throttle body (not too likely,
but it could happen).

Any chance that your throttle pedal is being held in place by a slipping
floor mat???

One other thing, on the 83-85/1 cars, there is an air bypass which usually
works when the Air Conditioning is turned on. Might be a factor if it is
sticking. (on later cars, Porsche used a Digital Idle Stabilizer valve.)

Subject: Re: 944 Hatch noises

Hi, Con,

The adjustments for the rattling hatch are indeed the posts which hang down
below the hatch.  

Start with one side of the hatch.

To make the adjustment, counter hold the post while loosening the 13 mm
locknut.  Shorten the post (i recommend 1/2 turn increments) and tighten the
locknut.  Check the latching.  Repeat until the hatch will no longer latch.
Undo the last adjustment.  

Repeat the sequence on the other side of the hatch.

Don't forget to ensure that the hinges (at the top of the hatch) are not
loose or losing their pins.

You may need to use some penetrating oil if the posts are rusty at all.

Good luck,

Hi Adam,

IMHO, these stickers are just "Revenue Enhancement Devices."  I don't belleve 
that any cop will cut you any slack if he stops you in a Porsche just because 
you have a sticker.  Put in on the rear bumper, or a prominent place in the rear
window of your "civilian" car and you *May* get a break (assuming all other 
factors make you look like an innocent, law-abiding citizen...)

A brief information about historic rallying in Europe:

Bjorn Waldegard (drove a 911 in rally with great succes during those lovely 
years) came second after Walter Rohrl (Ford Escort Twin Cam) in a 
914/6 in the Koln-Ahrweiler rally 1994. Nurburgring was one of the stages.

Bjorn reported the 914/6 to be harder to drive than the 911
(he also drives a 911 in historic racing).

Another Swede (Ake Andersson) came 11:th in a 911. Ake won in the RAC 
Historic Rally the following weekend. In this rally a 911 was in 1:st, 
2:nd, 3:rd, 5:th, 6:th position.

     unfortunately the answer is "no." My brother's late '84 Euro
     "S" model (4.7l/300hp) died last week. Its unsure which died first
     (the belt itself wrapped around the crank pulley, and the idler
     pulley on the tensioner collapsed) but if your 928/944 is not "safe"
     I'd definitely suggest checking/replacing servicing the belt;
      1. The idler pulleys on the water pump
      2. The idler pulley on the tensioner
      3. Check the tensioner arm (I had one wear out where the tensioner pin
          contacts it, my brother has had one fracture).
      
     I've had all these go bad on my '79 928, fortunately those years are
     "safe" and the heads stay on the car. 

      A question for anybody who knows; did the Euro 4.7liter 928 use
     different or same valves as the early 2-valve models ? I've still got
     a pair of spare 928 heads with valves in the garage waiting to find 
     a home....
     
             thanks--Lee

This sounds like induction icing

What is probably happening is the air entering the inlet system is at or 
around 0 deg C the low inlet pressure associated with running part 
throttle causes the inlet charge to cool further - say minus 8 deg C.

This cools the metal of the system and causes any moisture in the air to 
turn to ice - normally at the point of lowest pressure ie around the 
throttle butterflies.

The obvious reason why this clears up later, is that the inlet air is
heated by the exhaust, but the exhaust is still cold - once the engine
warms up - no problem. 

There is no obvious fix to this problem. It is of course a very serious
problem in aircraft, where the inlet gets completely blocked with ice, and
is the reason why we always fast idle an aircraft engine until the oil is
warm. 

Porsche used to recommend fast idling of the 911 engine - I don't know if 
they still do.

This is also good practice from the point of looking after the cams etc.

In my experience carb icing occurs on humid days at 60-80 deg f.  when it's
at or near freezing already the temperature drop in the induction system
produces nothing (or very small ice crystals which just flow along with
the air ) - and it's not humid out anyway so there's little moisture
to start with.  when it's warmer - roughly where the temp drop takes the
humid air to right around 32f - that's when ice builds up on 
throttle plates etc.

Subject:  more 914 Engine Assembly questions 

I started re-assembling my 914 engine several weeks ago, and have been
carefully following the manual and all the threads on the mailing list
to make sure I do it right.  Well, something doesn't seem quite right.

The motor moves smoothly until I bolt on the flywheel, then it is
impossible to move.  I measured the endplay, ordered the correct shims,
installed them & the o-ring, but when I torque the flywheel on, I can
no longer turn the crankshaft.  At first I thought that the flywheel was
rubbing against the outside edge of the main seal, but now I'm not sure.

Other notes:
Engine is a stock 1974 1.8L 

The new main oil seal I ordered from German Parts & Restoration is about
2 mm less deep than the old one.  The old one potruded from the case, while
the new one is recessed.

It seems odd that after carefully measuring the end-play and installing
the correct shims, to install an o-ring between the shims and the flywheel.
Am I installing the o-ring in the correct place?  Is it supposed to get
flattened?

What is the effect of having incorrect shimming? (I'm guessing)
To thick of shims and you will have excess endplay.
To thin of shims and the flywheel will rub the case and not be able to move.
The above would describe the problem I may be having, but I seem to have
followed the procedures correctly.  I've had friends help me verify
everything.  Is there something I'm missing?

I tried to draw a crude ascii drawing of what I believe the picture to be.
It may be that I can't figure out what is wrong because I don't understand
what it looks like.  If so perhaps someone could correct it for me.

So, thats my problem.  Can anyone offer any words of wisdom to a beginner.

Thanks in advance ...Tim Murphy (tmurphy@bnr.ca)

 i have 2 that are in need of rust repair.i know that i can buy all the
 sheetmetal to get the job done and i own welding stuff but at what point
 does the car become not worth the effort?
  i changed the floor in my current road going car and found the job not too
 difficult but cannot imagine what changing rockers and a floor would be like?
  how do you keep the car straight without a gigantic jig?
   
 has anyone ever replaced all these tough spots on a single car?

Subject: Removal of Auxiliary Air Valve on a 944

Here are my experiences on removing the auxiliary air valve on a 85.1 944:

My car was not fast idling after starting now that the temps are getting close
to freezing here in NJ. So I figured that perhaphs the auxiliary air valve
could be stuck in the closed position. I followed the Chiltons and Probst
manual on FI to diagnose it.

This valve provides additional unmetered air by opening up when cold and by-passing the throttle. It helps during cold starting. It works by means of a
bi-metallic arm that opens and closes an orifice based on outside temp. 
It is helped to close by applying voltage and warming the metallic strip
and thus contracting it. It is positioned on top of the block and underneath
the intake manifold.

It has two hoses that connect to it and a connector that supplies voltage to it
whenever the fuel pump is on. All manuals indicate that the intake manifold
must be removed to replace it. I proved them wrong, at least on non-turbo cars
like mine.

Tools that you will need: 
3/8 rachet
10mm socket
spark plug wrench
screw driver
4" 3/8 extension
3/8 universal joint
hex bit (4mm?)
parts retriever (claw type)
patience

Procedure:
Remove the #2 plug and plug hole with something. We do not want anything 
falling into the abbyss... Remove #3 plug wire and put aside

The valve has an electrical connector. Remove it.

The valve mounts to an angled bracket that mounts on the engine block by means
of two hex bolts. Here lies the trick to removing it with the manifold in
place. It is impossible to try to remove the 10mm bolts that hold the valve
to its support. But once you loosen the support, it can be done.

Using the 4" extension and the universal joint remove both hex bolts. There 
should be enough play in the rubber hoses to to allow you remove the top
hose connecting to the valve. Once clear, remove the two bolts holding it to
the support.

The other end of the valve has a hose that connects to the front of the
engine, under the tube that comes from the air cleaner. The trick here is to 
remove it from there since it is impossible to undo it from underneath the
intake manifold. Loosen the clamp (I think is close to the back of the 
timing belt cover, jiggle the valve to see where the hose ends...) and pull the
valve/hose out from underneath the intake manifold. Check the hose routing
for reassembly. 

Once the valve/long hose assembly is removed, separate the hose from the valve.
Clean with your favorite degunker by shutting some of it in the hole and 
using a small screwdriver to jiggle the plate that controls the hole size.

At room temp, there should be a small opening. After a few minutes in the
freezer (Don't let your SO see you do this :) the hole will be uncovered.
It will close up again at room temp.

As they say, retrace your steps to reassembly. The parts grabber helps when
positioning the washers for the hex bolts and picking up parts that might
fall by the block. Some grease will help to hold hex bolts to bit for
reassembly.

It took me about 1 hour to do. Good luck and all disclaimers apply!

The cruise control should not be the problem. If I'm correct, the cruise 
control regulates engine speed to keep the car velocity constant. This means 
that if your cruise control was on and  you push in the clutch, the engine 
speed should increase to try to compensate for the deceleration. Because 
your engine speed stays constant, I'm fairly confident this isn't the 
problem.

Subject: 911/2 Front Suspension Adjustments


Greetings P-Philers,

Okay, I'm trying to adjust the height of my '66 912's front suspension.

The shop manuals say the control arms should be initially set (with no
load) to 10 degrees below "level."  Okay, so I bought a $10 level
with a "dial" and is magnetized to be able to set on the arm whilst adjusting
the thing.

Is there a better way?  The level isnt that great, and my rubber bushings
are all new so once they're in, they are there forever  - because it will be
a major pain to take this all newly painted suspension apart (yet) again.

How important is this anyway, since the torsion bars arent even in until
later in the procedure?  My guess is the 10 degrees is just to make sure
the rubber bushings are not pre-loaded with any stress.

Ideas?

I've got all too much experience diagnosing underside leaks :-(

`Clear' is a relative term.  Soak some of the spilled fluid onto a
sheet of white paper.  You should immediately be able to tell:

* Viscosity: thin (water or gasoline), thick (oil), or very thick (gear oil).

* Color: clear water (condensate from A/C etc)
	clear, gasoline odor (fuel)
	clear to bluish water (windshield washer fluid)
	clear water that eats the paper overnight (battery acid)
	clear to bluish or yellowish or brown oil (brake/clutch fluid)
	fluorescent greenish water (coolant)
	pinkish oil (ATF)
	caramel to brown oil (motor lube)

Look for the forward-most part on the underbody that is wet with
fluid... this is the leaky one, most likely.  Also, the surest way to
tell what's leaking is to check all your fluids and watch for the one
that is dropping over time.

Subject: 944 throttle sticking


Ref Martin's comment about 60-80 deg icing

True it can occur at 60-80 degs in an aircraft, but not a car

The reason an a/c can ice at 80 deg is that in a prolonged descent you 
can have several minutes of closed throttle and low pressure in the inlet 
manifold.

This is less likely in a 944

The most likely conditions for icing are high humidity and low temp 
typically at this time of year in maritime areas there may be only one 
degree between ambient and dew point, thus it takes a very small pressure 
change to reduce the charge temp by one deg.

If the engine manifold is at -2 degs and the ambient is +1 and dew point 0, 
water will condense out in the inlet manifold and will freeze.

Charge temp and pressure are directly related for every 4 mB drop in 
pressure the charge will be cooled by about 1 deg C.

 -273 abs zero boils law and all that.

Nah, the only "true" Porsche is the electric caisson.

Subject: 356 Purchase Questions Continued...


Thanks to everyone who helped with the 356 valuation message -- there 
are too many to even list!
It's amazing, but the SO is actually excited about this car and said 
to go for it! Amazing because 2 BMW 2002 parts cars went through my 
posession this week, I have 3 other projects around, 2 of which will 
have to go if the 356 joins the family, and we have a baby due in May. 
I am a little concerned about the engine condition, so I purchased 
about 6 books this weekend to help.  One of 'em, "Porsche 356 
Performance Handbook", mentioned a shop by Greg Emory in Costa Mesa, 
CA. -- anybody know the name of the shop or have a phone #?  Any other 
people in the area that I could have a pre-purchase inspection done?\
TIA... again.

In the NJ/PA area I see the Volvo 740's running with fog lamps in the rear 
light cluster with the brake lights.  They just about blind you when get 
close enough to pass.

I believe the 924 had an optional fog lamp that mounted under the bumper 
closer to the ground.  This setup is much friendlier to passing motorists, 
though I don't see many Porsches being passed...

A steady 2 amp charge will eventually overcharge and boil out your battery 
acid.

There is a solution.  I have seem "automatic" battery chargers that shut 
themselves on/off to maintain a proper charge.  They go $40 and up and are 
available from J.C. Whitney, Groits and I believe Imparts.  I have also seen 
them at some local auto parts stores.

I would still remove the battery, or at the least disconnect the cables so 
the cars electric system is not hooked up.

     Do you guys know anything about "turning" the pistons in the calipers
     when you change the pads?  I heard that it extends pad life.  Is this
     true?

The pistons on Porsches have one specific orientation and should not be 
rotated once they are set properly.

When I rebuilt my calipers the pistons ended up being off a bit.  I couldn't 
get them to turn easily by hand, so I had to settle for close.  The car 
stops like a Porsche should, so It doesn't worry me.  The one caliper where 
the piston is off a bit does a squeak a bit  now and then while the others 
are OK.  The orientation may be the culprit here.

My 928 shop manual shows a tool to turn them, but I have never been able 
find this tool.  Does anyone know where I can purchase this tool?

When I work on my 928 it always seems to be the one I don't have/can't 
afford.

Seriously though, if you have a shop manual look at what procedures you are 
most likely to do in the future and see what is needed.  Do this every few 
months and you should be able to collect them all in a reasonable order.

We faced the same issue and after careful measurement of the width of the
rear seat between the belts bought a Century 3000.  This is a 'toddler' seat 
and not for newborns but you'll need one in 3 mths.  This fits fine tho' not 
much legroom in front for your SO. I just removed the rear bar (height 
adjuster) and this frees up about 2" more.  This is a pain in the *ss if it's 
a dual-car seat.  I don't know if you can safely fit a rear-facing baby-seat 
in the rear of a 944.  Your SO may have to sit in the rear for a few months 
tho' I think the baby is supposed to ride in the rear.

Related issue: the top of the baby-seat tilts forward under moderate  
braking due to the low lap belt placement.  Needless to say, this startled me 
the first time it occurred with my daughter in the seat. Simple fix: tie a 
piece of nylon cord around the top of seat and attach it to the rear loop near
the hatch lock.  Note that you should NOT have a rear-facing infant seat in 
the front seats due to possible injury from the air-bags (if so equipped).  
Heard right here on P-philes of someone rolling in their 951 at 130 mph.  He 
escaped unscathed though the car had a roll cage and was of course totalled.

Subject: Boxster news, '73 911 question

Hi,

I was at the newstand today and flipped through the November 18 issue of
Auto, Moto und Sport, a German car magazine. In it they had a little news
about the Boxster.  _According_  to the magazine the Boxster will not get the
4 cylinder engine. The marketing people don't  think  that a 4 cylinder
belongs in a DM 75,000 ($50,000) car. Instead the base Boxster will get a
2.5l flat-6 with 200 hp and the upscale version will have 250hp. The car is
currently undergoing suspension testing.  If you are shocked about the price,
don't  forget that  European auto prices are about 25% higher than here in
the US. 

Now to a question relating to my car.  I met somebody recently who also has a
'73 911. He noticed that my car had the large rubber bumpers instead of the
chrome one that came with the earlier cars.  He said that only the '73.5 911s
came with these bumpers and that  the early '73s
had the old style chrome bumpers. Is that correct? It seems to me after
looking at all the catalogues that the big bumpers were for all US spec '73
911s. Anybody want to confirm this? 

thanks,
Neil Kumpers
'73 911S targa


P.S.  On  my way back from windsurfing on Thursday (In Miami it was a cool 78
degrees F), a  flatbed tow truck was blocking half  the road.  As a
approached I saw that a Ferrari Testarossa was being loaded up onto the
flatbed.  Unfortunately I couldn't resist the temptation so I made a left
turn, slowed down and politely yelled out of the window "Shoulda bought a
Porsche!" The Ferrari owner had a good chuckle and I drove off. It was just
too bad that I wasn't driving my 911 at the time.

Subject: Dual electric mirrors

In the November 94, PCA Panorama magazine, there is a brief discussion
of C2 mirror installation on page 30.

The text has "The assembly of the mirror base and headpiece is
difficult, sometimes requiring two people to compress a rather
large tension spring and lock bolt"

There may be an easier way.

If the C2 assembly is similar to the later "square" style electic mirrors, 
the lock bolt is a hollow bolt to allow the wiring to reach the mirror motors.

I installed a dual electric mirror kit on my 72T and learned some things
about them.  The dealer supplied kit came with zero documentation and 
required some extra parts.

It became a learning experience. 

If you're curious, read on.

In assembling the mirror base + headpiece I used a 2.5" X 1/4 - 20 bolt + nut
+ washer (a 8mm X 65mm bolt should also work) to draw the tension 
spring + lock bolt into the mirror headpiece threads.

1/4-20 is approximately a 1.25 metric thread pitch.

The 2.5" long bolt head rests inside the hollow lock bolt's head, and the 
mirror + base is assembled with the 1/4-20 nut + washer inside the mirror
housing.

Then the 2.5" bolt is tightened with a socket wrench on the bolt head
and an open end wrench on the nut in the mirror housing to compress the 
mirror spring and draw the hollow bolt into engagement. 

When the lock bolt's threads engage, the tension on the 1/4-20 will
drop because one turn of the 1/4-20 bolt advances the bolt 1.25mm
while the threads on the mirror lock bolt are 1.5mm.  So each turn of
the lock bolt after engagement puts 0.25mm of slack in the thru bolt/nut assy.

After the lock bolt is engaged for a 5 or 6 threads, the 1/4-20 bolt
can be removed and a 12mm star drive (the same as on the 911 flywheel bolts)
is used to do the final tightening.

Another item to keep in mind is the electrical differences between
early/late electric mirrors.

As far as I can determine, the early electric mirrors had one motor to 
position the mirror in both horizontal/vertical axis.  A magnetic clutch
determined which axis was changed.   So the early mirrors saw +/-12 volts 
to the mirror motor and either +12 or 0V to the magnetic clutch depending 
on the axis selected.

Later mirrors (1987+) used separate horizontal/vertical motors.
The motors require independent +/-12 volts for each motor, and will not
work with the earlier mirror wiring. 

To make later mirrors work with earlier wiring, the magnetic clutch
drive lines can activate a 12V SPDT (single pole-double throw relay) added
inside each door.  The SPDT relay will switch +/-12volts to the appropriate
mirror motor under control of the magnetic clutch on/off signal line.
One motor drive wire is common to the other motor's drive wire in this
arrangement.

Subject: 911/944 revisited

Having done a brake rebuild to my 944 last week, I can truly say:

Gauges, we don't neeed no stinking gauges!!!

What I did was construct one from a piece of cardboard. Take a protractor
remember your school days?? and create a cardboard gauge at a 20 deg angle.

The rebuilding instructions (ATE) had directions depending on whether
the caliper is in front or back of the axle.

I used a large pair of channel-lock pliers to gently turn the pistons
to the desired position. 

The 911 haynes manual shows the procedure/tool. The 944 hayne's manual
does not. The workshop manual in microfilm shows it for the 944. YMMV

Alex, what's the VIN structure on your '69 914?  I was under the impression

Is it 470..... or 469.....?  Inquiring minds want to know.

One possible reference book is "Car Beautiful" by Henry Watts.

Do not use ARMORALL ON ANYTHING.
Lexol works good on leather.

one thing that works good on vinyl dashes is vaseline. I put it on the 
914 and 911 and let is stand for a couple of days then wipe off the 
excess.
 
Your best bet once the car is detailed is use a good car cover to keep 
the sun and elements off the car. I have used a car cover on my 73 914 
since new and there is no interior fading. The gauge needles look brand 
new and this is after 20 years.  The car was my daily driver for the 
first 5-8 years.

On product I use on the rubber seals is Turtle wax "clear gaurd" This 
has put some of the "oils" back in old rubber.

For wax I use Zymol and all my cars. Expensive first outlay but in the 
long run is cheaper than most waxes. If you do want to use Zymol then ck 
into the Meguires line of procuts. They are avail in bulk from Imparts.

This is to reduce noise by allowing air to escape from under the belt. The belt
and hose division of pirelli was purchased last spring by Dayco Products inc,
they can only use the name pirelli for one year so by summer there will be no
more "pirelli" brand belts. Dayco is one of the largest manufactures of belts

find a car that grabs you. It is a fairly simple matter to find 10 to 20
356s in various Traders in southern California in any given week. Even if
only 5% are good cars, that means you only have to go a couple of weeks at
most before running across a good car. Price is another matter...

Ed Robinson asks
 
>Does anyone know of a manual or other publication I may use as a guide in
>restoring a 356??
 
There are a few worthwhile books on the 356, but no cookbook restoration
guide per se. You have to do a lot of detective work on your own, but
to me that's part of the fun of getting into 356s.
 
First and foremost, the official factory repair manuals and parts catalogs,
with their exploded views, are an absolute necessity. No other source covers
the mechanicals anywhere near as well.
 
2) Brett Johnson's "Porsche 356 Restorer's Guide to Authenticity." Limited
to cosmetic and readily visible exterior/interior hardware, a few mistakes,
but nevertheless the only book of its kind.
 
3) Brand new, Brett Johnson's compilation of 356 Registry tech articles.
"356 Porsche Technical and Restoration Guide." A steal at $19.95 for 400+
pages. Tons of really useful information in there, including body repair and
painting, but unfortunately no photos made the transition from old Registries
to this book, line art only; therefore,
 
4) Back issues of the 356 Registry. You should join if not already a
member. Some back issues still available.
 
5) "Porsche 356: Driving in its purest Form" by Dirk-Michael Conradt.
Complete history of the 356. Lots of factory photographs. (OK, I confess, I
did the translation from the original German. So sue me).
 
6) "Porsche 356 Performance Handbook" by Duane Spencer. Useful even if
you're not going to race.
 
7) Just get online here and ask. Somebody may know the answer.
 
8) ALWAYS QUESTION THE ANSWERS YOU GET FROM ANYBODY, ANY BOOK.
Get as much info as possible, then make up your own mind as to what's right
and what isn't. There is a lot of misinformation in the 356 world.
 
9) Get the Registry, get on the mailing lists for Stoddard (get their catalog,
good info in there as to what's available), also get on mailing lists for
other suppliers. Tweeks has a useful catalog to see what's available on the
market, then you should go out and buy it elsewhere, cheaper, from competent
sales personnel. Go to lots of car shows and don't believe everything you
hear about what was allegedly "original."
 
Books 2, 3, and 5 can be ordered directly from Brett Johnson, at
1-800-553-5319. He has a special offer going now, if you order (5) before
the end of the year, you can get (2) in the rare hard cover version for
$21.47. Because I use it a lot, I like the hardcover version better than the
softbound version, which is $24.95 without this offer anyway.
 
Good luck,

Subject:       Wheel questions

I have a '75 911s with cheap Fuchs copies purchased by a previous 
owner (see my post on wheel balancing).  I'm probably going to buy
new wheels soon,  to cure my extreme shimmy problem,
and to get some decent looking wheels.  I want to get silver spoke 
Fuchs five spoke wheels, preferably used (cheaper, since I'm not 
overly concerned with finish).

I'm presently running 7x15 wheels all the way around (stock is 6x15), 
and I kind of like the bigfoot look.  I am planning on doing a lot of
autocrossing, and I won't be able to afford a set of competition 
wheels for at least a year if not two or three (need new shocks,
couple of tires, tranny overhaul, etc. first).  The car is 
primarily a street machine, and I don't want to sacrifice sensible 
street handling.  I need some wheels that will strike
a happy medium. What is the general wisdom on wheel size? Is
there some pressing reason to go back to 6x15?  What about 6 in front 
and 7 in back, since this configuration seems to be readily available 
used (SC stock sizes)?

Where should I shop for wheels?  What should I expect to pay?  What 
kind of guarantees will I find?  How do I check wheels (true? dinged? 
straight? round? etc?)?  Should I avoid used wheels?

Any advice will be appreciated.

Subject: Buying a SC vs. Carrera




Well, the spousal unit has given the okay, and even with two
kids I am on the hunt for a 911 (yes, the other car is a Pathfinder )
I figured there might be some deals in the fall/winter, and am prepared
to go into spring until I find exactly the right car.

Anyways, I have two questions:

I am confused about what a Porsche mechanic told me yesterday. I know
the net wisdom appears to be "buy the latest model that you can afford",
so I am following that tack. I am looking at 82 or 83 SC's, and 84 or 85
Carreras, assuming that the Carrera, although typically more expensive, 
an overall better car. 

Anyways, the mechanic told be that the SC is better because its engine is 
bullet proof, vs the 3.2 in the Carrera, where the top end tends to wear
early, and need replacement at 60K miles. This is contrary to what I seem
to have read (of course, I am confused now). He also said that the SC
engines tend to wear evenly, so when a rebuild is needed, the whole
engine needs to be done ( he quoted around 15K CND, or about 12K US). 
The Carrera (3.2) tends to wear heads first, then the bottom end.

Another friend who as a '76 S thought that I should get a 911 with less than
60K miles because the heads would need to be done. I pointed out that that
may be true with his year 911, but the SC's don't have that problem. He
said I was wrong.

So, given reasonable maintenance and non-violent driving, can I get more than
60K miles out of a SC engine before the heads need to be done, and is the 
Carrera engine "weaker" and the SC engine?

Thanks big time..

After replacing two of these little plastic socket dooleys' I found that
taking the passenger seat out will help, especially if you have Recaros et al
(hard to get your hand and tools between the seat and the control unit ). 
Having the seat out will also help in adjusting the actuating rod.  This 
job can be done without removing the seat, but it sure saves a lot of time 
and cussing.

You might want to check the interior workings (ie. micro switches) of the
control unit which are easily bent out of alignment before you put it back
together.

While you have the control unit off, you might also want to check that 
your emergency brake cables are engaging evenly. Consult manual.

Last words of wisdom - DON'T PULL UP ON THE LEVER.

Forgive me if this doesn't apply here, but it could help somebody else
then.  If the gas pedal is attached to and pivots from the floor, you could
have ice build up at the bottom of the pedal, preventing complete release.
Back when I used to use my other 914 in the winter, this would happen,
because the slush on shoes would kinda ooze down and the pressure from my
foot would make it like a packed snowball.  And of course in a 914 it will
never warm up enough to melt it :(

Subject:       Shake and Rattle while Rolling


My '75 911s has once again developed a severe shimmy at highway 
speed.  In the past, this problem has been remedied by balancing the 
wheels on the car (dynamic balancing, not a cheap 
fix at about $75-$100 for all four wheels).  I've had this done twice 
in the last five months, since the wheels don't stay balanced after 
they are removed and replaced (with the studs lined up the same...).  
I'm perfectly willing to go through this once or twice a year, but not every
time I take the wheels off.

The guy at the balancing shop (a place that is familiar with Porsches 
and high speed cars) said that the problem lies in my wheels, 
which are cheap aftermarket Fuchs copies.  He said that Fuchs wheels 
fit closely to the hub, so that the weight distribution/balance is 
the same every time you put them on, whereas the cheaper wheels have 
loose tolerances.

What's the general wisdom out there?  Is this a common problem?  
What's the usual fix?  What are some other possible causes I should 
look into?

Here's the specifics:
'75 911s with 4 7x15 wheels
Pirelli P6 (???) tires on the front, ~10,000 mi. (had them 
trued/shaved, because one wasn't round)
Bridgestone RE71 ~1000 mi. on the rear
I think the tires are 205/60 all the way around (might be 225/60, I 
have a poor memory for this sort of thing)

At about 50 mph the steering wheel starts to wobble, by 65 mph its 
going up and down by 3/4" or more (very unpleasant).

The car was running fine, with no shimmy up to 80 mph.  Then I 
tightened the front wheel bearings and took the car in for an 
alignment.  After that, things were awful.

I'm at wits end, having spent over $200 on wheel balancing.

So are you.

I meant if someone had one used, perhaps once, or perhaps just taken
out of the box.  I don't want a part off of a 20+ year old car that
will most likely fail just after installing it!!

==  How do you KNOW that slightly used part is that new?  Whom can you 
believe?
==  Harumph!  If it failed(s) dissect  it to figure out what Bosch was doing 
to make it work, and maybe ==learn what makes it fail.  What if that bad 
part is the last one in the world . . .? or it just needed a ==drop of oil 
to make it unstick.  These sensors and whatnot are really pretty simple 
devices. Only in the last 10 years have surface mount components been used 
in commercial applications and that is when the complexity began to go off 
the scale. (even then its not too bad)
==  So what if it is 20+ years old.  If it was stored well it might still be 
NOS or UOS.
==  For the price of two used parts; use one and keep the other as spare (in 
the trunk).

Electrical parts, IMHO, should never be bought from a used or junk pile.
Costs a bundle more when you buy a whole group of junk than one expensive
new, dependable part.

Mike

== Keyword here being 'dependable'.
==  Would this include blower and starter motors, alternators, and guages? 
 NO!  Why not?  Because we understand wear patterns and fail modes.  (same 
is true on mechanical parts . . . if you can measure it.)
== I contend that criteria for pass/fail on used parts would be;

== 1) can it be tested or measured/calibrated or re-calibrated
== 2) is it easily swapped (for test purposes)
== 3) can it be proofed to operate under all conditions (hot, cold, wet, 
dry, vibration etc.) see 2 above
== 4) price competetive with new

==  It boils down to just 'does it work' and whether it will continue to 
work . . . in the real world on 'new' and supposedly dependable parts the 
question falls to 'warranty'.  (even new parts can fail ". . .just after 
installing it.")
==  I warranty my whole car full of 20 year old parts by keeping on hand a 
full complement of -you guessed it- USED parts to backup my USED parts. 
 With exception to maybe fuel injectors, but now I'm touching on another 
industry who 'rebuilds' used parts and sells them for a fair price (with a 
warranty).  btw, I HATE rebuilt water pumps (they never last like the oem 
part).

== IMHO my point is that as long as people's lives are not dependent on it, 
why suppose a new part merits greater trust than a proven used part.
==  The industry has a term for this, it is called "BURNED IN" and refers to 
how a collection of parts are operated in a finished product fresh off the 
assembly line.  There is a LOT of statistical analysis behind 'burn-in' that 
says once a part is proven, the probability of failure drops off real quick, 
then picks up again toward an intended design life (which is difficult to 
define when the end will occur).

The price for the balancing seems steep compared even with the generally
cut-throat prices around my area.  Is dynamic balancing done with the
wheels on the car?

I read somewhere (no references, that was before I started noting them),
that the weights at a particular point should be split between the inside
and outside of the rim ie the weight you see on the outer face of the rim
is half the total weight at that point.  The other half should be on the
inner face of the rim.  I know lots of shops don't do this.

General wisdom (?) is that Pirellis go out of round quickly.  Verified on a
sample of 4 tyres (dad's car).

I used to routinely knock back 600+ miles in a single sitting in
my '81 Euro SC, then repeat same returning the following day. And 
never compromised on the performance issue.  Full hard shocks, 
sticky tires, etc. all the time. If you're into *DRIVING*  -- the 
actual going, not the being someplace, then it's a very enjoyable
road car. Give up on the "creature comforts" thing though; you'll
get wind noise, and exhaust noise, and engine noise, and won't hear
your stero or radar detector if you're driving in the well-over-the-
posted-speed-limit range.

The stiff suspension, etc, is not a big deal. If you want
a big deal, try doing the same in your 914 with 21mm front torsion
bars, 180 lbs rear springs and Konis set full hard on 50 series
tires.... Had to do that a few times too...

In the first year I owned the SC, I had two principal clients, located 
exactly 97 miles from each other (Houston is a BIG place). More than 
one day I had meetings at both the same day. 300 mile days just around
town were not uncommon. Did a total of 18K miles on that one car that 
year, plus another 7K on two other cars...

All true... The big issue is that there just aren't any extremely high
milage 3.2s out there for "longitudinal studies". There have been 3.0s
since '78, so they are pretty well understood. However, in additional to
the hard mechanical reliability, there's a more important issue: the
fuel injection system.

As late as late '93 I still told people to get a '82-3 SC as the ideal
low maintenece 911. Since then, I've suggested a 3.2 Carrera, with
my personal preference being the '86 (915 trans, but "fixed" A/C system).
Why? Well, for most people, dealing with the CIS injection on the SC
is very very painful -- it's a hydraulicly operated mechanical system, 
and when anything in the control paths gets out of spec, it screws everything
up. The parts last a long time, but they're all getting old. So unless
you're prepared to spend the up to $2k to replace *EVERYTHING* when (not
IF, *WHEN*) it starts giving you trouble, you might want to avoid having
to deal with it at all. 

The 3.2, on the other hand, uses the DME controls which is a pulsed 
injection system. Things still go wrong, but it's a lot simpler to
diagnose, and cheaper to repair.

I have a  ton of wierd special stuff for tweaking and tuning CIS
left over from a mis-spent youth building sprint cars and dragsters
and stuff using Kinsler CIS. And, as a result, still like CIS for my
personal cars. But if you have to deal with it day in and day out, and
don't like screwing with it, the DME cars really, really, really are
simpler do deal with.

No problem on that! I had just over 150K miles on my '81 Euro SC when
I sold it in September, and those were *NOT* "non-violent" miles. There
is a ton of autobahn time on it, plus track time in the US, plus a 
pile of autoxes, plus I'm just hard on sports cars on the street...
You should be able to hit 200K with no problem on a 3.0. Like I
said, no one really knows on the 3.2, but I've seen 120K mile cars
that seemed to be fine...

Subject: re:  more 914 Engine Assembly questions 



    The motor moves smoothly until I bolt on the flywheel, then it is
    impossible to move.  I measured the endplay, ordered the correct shims,
    installed them & the o-ring, but when I torque the flywheel on, I can
    no longer turn the crankshaft.  At first I thought that the flywheel was
    rubbing against the outside edge of the main seal, but now I'm not sure.
    
Are you sure the shim you received is the one you ordered? You can check
this with a micrometer, and check the endplay with a dial indicator. I
know these are expensive but they are important for doing a proper rebuild
(i.e. necessary).

    Am I installing the o-ring in the correct place?  Is it supposed to get
    flattened?
    
No, it shouldn't be flattened. It goes in a recess in the flywheel so that
it can seal against the side of the crankshaft, not the end. It should
have no bearing on end-play, that is, it sould not be between the flywheel
and crank at their interface (the surface that the five bolts go through).

    What is the effect of having incorrect shimming? (I'm guessing)
    To thick of shims and you will have excess endplay.
    To thin of shims and the flywheel will rub the case and not be able to move.
    The above would describe the problem I may be having, but I seem to have
    followed the procedures correctly.  I've had friends help me verify
    everything.  Is there something I'm missing?
    
You've got it backwards. if the shims are too thick, you will have no or
less endplay. if they are too thin you will have excessive endplay.

Try tightening up the flywheel with one shim removed. if the crank turns
freely, your shims were too thick. Do the endplay measurement (preferably
with a dial indicator) with the two shims in place, subtract your desired
endplay from the measurement and that is your shim thickness needed. Of
course, you can only check your shim with a micrometer to see if you were
sent the right one. If you need another one, you should also order another
flywheel seal, as it is very difficult to change shims with the seal in
place and not nick the seal face. Unfortunately, if you remove it, chances
are high that it will be slightly warped. Either way, don't take the
chance, get a new seal.

I hope this helps,

Subject: Re: It's a boy! Now how do I get him into my 944?

Con,

The best solution I've seen starts with a child seat which has an
adjustable tubular U-section at the back.  The adjustment is one
which lets you rotate the U forward or back to set the seat angle.

But what you do is remove the U-section altogether.  The remaining
seat fits very nicely into a rear Porsche seat-lette.  I tried this
with our Century model 2000 STE seat, and it worked fine.

The bad news is that apparently this sort of design is no longer
employed because of the perceived risk of children catching their
fingers where the adjustable section meets the main seat frame.  It
may well be that the newer designs, whatever they may be, afford the
same "decontenting" and its benefit.

Porsche makes and sells kiddie seats in Germany, and presumably all
non-North American markets.  This is what we get for letting product
liability lawyers walk the streets.  They have a number of models,
and they look great.

By the way, I found that our US-legal infant seat fit fine in the
back of our car, as is.  It is only when you move up to the child
seats that fit seems to be a problem.

Folks,

This is for all of you who have air bags and children.  Do *NOT* seat
your children in the front seat, *particularly* in a rear-facing
infant seat.  If an air bag deploys, the child's head could be subject
to a force up to 300G's when the child is in such a rear-facing seat.
An adult head can withstand 80 G's, briefly; a child's head considerably
less.

This was covered in an article in the 9/93 issue of Automobile.  I
haven't since seen it mentioned anywhere else.

Subject: Loose Elec. mirrors on 911

Hello,

I saw a note on the porsche list that some people installed
the square looking electric mirrors on a 911.  I have
an 81 911 with these electric mirrors, and my drivers side
door mirror is very loose.  It is loose where the smaller
base part connects to the door itself, and also where the
mirror head part connects to the smaller base part.

Is there something I can do to tighten this mirror?  I was told
there is a special tool to install/remove this, since the
wires go up through the base.  To make the head part less
loose, I was going to go as far as wedging tinfoil or
wrapping a layer of cloth tape over its mounting post (assuming
I could remove or raise the head part enough to expose
the cylindrical mounting post).  Then pressing the head part
back over the post.  The cloth medical tape, or tinfoil, or
whatever, would take up the space and make the mirror
head snug again.  I have no clue what to do about the base
and do not want to buy another mirror as the car was just
painted, and the mirror was painted in this process.

What can I do to aleviate my loose mirror problems?

Hello,

What is a fair $$ price for a set 4 of factory Porsche Fuch's rims 
with Pirelli P7's mounted and balanced on them, off of a 911?
The sizes are: 2 Rear - 15x8 and 2 Front - 15x7.  The rear tires have
about 1/8 inch of tread on them, and are slightly cracked from rubber
corrosion (ie:rear tires need replacing), while the front tires are close
to new in tread wear, and have no problems.  Two of the rims have curb 
scratches around the perimiter, but are not bent in any way.  I was told 
that these rims sell for over $1K each from the factory.

The scratches seem like they could be removed from light polishing, they 
are not gouges in the aluminum.  Can this be done myself with steel wool 
or something (the scratches are just on the outer lip of the rim, and 
are not deep)?  How much is this set of four fuchs worth?

Subject: re: 944 fog lamps


High intensity rear fog lamps are a mandatory requirement
for vehicles in most of the EC. Sadly, there appears to be
no mandatory requirement that vehicle drivers should have a
brain, or if they do have one that they should use it. The reason
I say this is that many drivers have the dual high intensity rear
fogs switched on in any conditions that are not 12 noon and bright
sunlight, thus it is common for the meterologically challenged to be
driving around in light rain in St. Albans town centre in early evening
with two powerful red searchlights projecting from the back of
their Mini Metro or other such rolling object. This results in
a great deal of blinding light and reflections in the wet road
surface. Any attempt to explain to the offending mouth-breathers
would result in a blank stare, a denial that their rear fogs are
on, a claim that they are perfectly entitled have them on if they
want, and probably the suggestion that a smack in the mouth sometimes
offends.

Of course, it is illegal to drive with the high intensity rear
fogs on in conditions that are not foggy, however, our traffic
police are unable to enforce this particular law because it
would unfairly discriminate against the meterologically challenged,
mouth-breathers, and the reto-crainially inverted. Also it would divert 
resources from important revenue generating tasks, such as maintaining 
GATSO machines, busting Porsche drivers for "possession of a bright red 
sports car in a public place with the intent to speed" and knocking off 
early for a few beers and 20 quid each way on Laughing Boy
in the 3:30 at Kemptown.

Thanks for the replies about the fog lamps.  I'm still wondering if anybody 
has in fact retrofitted them in a 944.

Another curious 944 question:  Has anyone used the empty spot below the 
radio to add any useful guages?  If so, is there a company out there that 
sells proper faceplate assembly to mount them there.  I haven't seen one 
specifically for the 944.  It seems like the normal 2-1/4" (I think) would 
fit, although I haven't measured.

Subject: re: 944 motor mounts

Nathan and P-philes:
Yes, I got the updated T mounts for $110. I included the part number
in my previous posting.  The updated part is much beefier than the 
original equipment.  

I changed mine this last weekend and this is what I found:

1) If you have an older 944 and it's vibrating, bite the bullet
and change the mounts.  It'll bring a tear to your eye.  The smoothness
is what this fine machine is all about.  The job is within reach
of the accomplished backyard mechanic, but requires some tools, skills,
and patience.

2) The right mount came out in two pieces.  They say to look for 
fluid leakage when examining a mount.  Mine showed no signs of leakage, 
it has apparently had NO fluid for nearly as long as I have owned the car.
To check the condition of your mounts, watch the right (exhaust) mount
while rev'ing the engine slightly.  The mount should compress nicely and the 
rubber will balloon slightly taking up the motion if it is OK.  Because of 
the weight of the engine it may "look" OK to the casual observer.  As a 
second check, fashion a [ shaped piece of stiff wire so that the points of
the wire are 60mm apart.  Use this gauge to measure the distance between
the top and bottom surfaces of the mounts.  If it is less, replace them.

3) My left mount "looked" OK but failed the measurement test, so I changed
both, and it sure is sweet!

Failure of the 911 automatic heater control is common.  Replacement is
about $600 which is what the dealer solution is.  I've got some
experience repairing these things which tend to fail in common ways.

1).  One of the two sensors may be bad.  The system works from two
     temperature sensors; one in the cabin and the other in the
     left side heat exchanger.  If one of these sensors fail the
     heat controller will either not work or go to full open depending
     on the failure mode.

     To check remove the control unit by undoing the four mounting
     bolts and unsnapping the control arm inside the unit.  Pop off
     the plastic cover on the right side of the unit to access the
     control arm.  Lift the unit up and remove the two white
     connectors at the rear.  These are the sensor inputs.  I can't
     remember which is the cabin and which is the heat exchanger
     but the cabin sensor will read approximately 1200 ohms at
     an ambient room temperature of about 65 degrees fahrenheit and
     the other will read about 150 degrees with the engine cold.  If
     the resistance reading is zero or infinity, the sensor must be
     replaced.

2)   Someone poured a beverage into the control unit or the contacts
     are dirty.  Beside the rheostat for the temperature selection are
     two microswtches.  In older models they are exposed, the later
     units utilized a sealed unit.  One controls "all closed" and the
     other "all open".  A spilled beverage, especially a soft drink,
     or accumulated grime will prevent these contacts from functioning.
     Clean them thoroughly with unlubricated electronic cleaner to
     remove any funk.

3)   The control rod became detached and caused the electronics board
     to fail.  Porsche obviously did not trust this unit as they left
     the heater control lever exposed.  Typically, this lever is pulled
     while attempting to get heat into the car.  If it is pulled
     hard enough the control rod will unsnap and wedge against the floor.
     When the heater control is activated the rod will
     be forced downward against the floor.  Porsche DID NOT fuse the
     unit separately with a low amperage fuse so one of the
     transistors on the board assumes the role.  I typically replace
     all four transistors.  Replace the two marked BD132/176 with
     2N5194 and the BD131/175 with 2N5191.  The case style of the
     transistors is TO-220.  The electronics board
     unplugs from the control unit.  It and the control switch
     platform can be obtained from the dealer for about $125 each.
     The four transistors should be less than $15 from an electronics
     parts house.  Replacement requires a low watage soldering iron and
     a few minutes time.

4)   While you're cleaning, wash down the two limit microswitches on the
     motor housing with electronic cleaner if the unit has exposed
     switch contacts.

A final warning to all 911 owners with automatic heat controllers.  If
the unit fails DO NOT attempt to use the heat control handle until you
pop open to plastic panel on the right of the heater control unit and
unsnap the control arm with an outward pull.  This will prevent item
three above from occurring and may prevent breakage of the control rod.
Remove the rubber cover from the front of the unit and use a coin or
screw driver to tighten the small bolt at the base of the heat control
lever.  This will apply enough friction to hold the lever open against
the heat box springs until you can repair the automatic unit.

>How tolerable is your 911 on long trips?

I drove from the Jungfrau region of Switzerland to North
London last May in about 9 hours including the Channel
ferry and getting a speeding ticket in France. I did not
exceed 155 MPH at any time, but in spite of that it
was a `tolerable' little 911 trip. The grin on my face from
redlining across Europe took about two days to wear off,
so I guess that I will be `tolerating' my 911 a little
longer. I still get flashbacks from the trip even now.

I would say that in general, the longer the trip in a 911
the better. I would also say the insane grin on the face
of a satiated 911 driver as he (or she) climbs out of the excellent 
sports seat at the end of a long, very, very fast drive across country, 
in the fading western sunlight of a hot summer evening, is a good 
indicator of the degree of pleasure that can be `tolerated' by the 
lucky driver.

I guess that the amount of 911 driving you can tolerate depends on how
high your pleasure threshold is!

    Interestingly enough, this isn't always the case.  At one point, I
needed a gasket for my oil filler on the 914.  After-market sources
in my immediate vicinity didn't have it.  So, I checked the local VW
dealer.  $8.00, and they'd have to order it--2 days to a week to get
it.  I needed it Right Away (don't we always?) so I checked at the
less-local Porsche/VW/Audi dealer.  Not only did they have it in
stock, but it was only $5.00...
    Moral:  check all sources, even ones that shouldn't have the most
reasonable prices--'cause they may!

I've taken my '72 on a few longish trips 3-4 hours.  I can get pretty
tiring, especially since I have pretty stiff suspension and its a little
loud.  I imagin the later one would be nicer since they seem to be
quieter.  I've taken mine several times from Sacramento to Santa Cruz,
with a surboard on top.  Talk about getting looks!

This is where the 914 may have an upper hand.
I've driven my 74 914 2.0L from Atlanta to the western suburbs of Chicago while 
only taking a break for an evening stop over.  The drive was smooth and quite 
comfortable. I was quite suprised (and pleased) to get both driving fun and 
comfort out of the same machine.  The total trip was roughly 13 hrs. not 
counting the stop for the night and it was done with only a tank and a half of 
fuel.

Our '83 911 has 70k miles, with stock suspension, but been lowered.  It's 
quite tolerable on long trips (for two people).  Firm ride but we don't find 
to too "hard" except on "washboard" roads.  In fact we prefer it to our 
Volvo 745T.  However, it is quite a bit louder than the Volvo (which is why 
I like it!).

Adjustable Koni's could be used for performance vs touring but the stock 
shocks are very good for all around use.

For the record:  (i) I don't like to pay a lot for wheels.
                        (ii) I don't like pirelli tires.

The *asking* price in Pano [which you already know since you *are* a PCA 
member aren't you?  ;-)  ] is in the $800 - $1200 range for non-perfect 
7&8x15's (for a set of 4).  They tend to be priced a bit higher individually.

I bought a set (of four) of 7&8x15 fuchs recently for $450.  One has a 
noticable cosmetic scratch.  The paint (anodizing?) is worn on all of them.  
They're not ugly but also not concourse.  These were advertised in Pano as
"track" wheels.  The asking price was $500/obo.  This set came without 
tires.

I have another set in slightly better condition that I bought several years 
ago, also for $450.   I got kind of lucky on these.  This set came with tires
I gave away on another set of wheels I was selling.

If the wheels are scratched I would not go over $800 for the set [remember,
I'm a cheap SOB].  A lot of it depends on how desperate you are.  You should 
find something for that price (or less) in Pano of you are willing to wait 
a few months.

The P7 has this nice belt delamination that (I believe) is not unsafe but
gives you this weird front end shimmy at around 65-70 mph.

Also, the only tire I've ever had blow out was a pirelli P3.  It had about 
1000 miles on it, had been properly inflated 3 day prior and was being 
driven at 65 mph.

Now I just say "no" and by Yoko's.

Now, why do you want new wheels?  An '81 'sc should have 6&7x16 fuchs.

If you run 50 series tires on the 15's they don't quite fill the fender wells.
You will also reduce the overall gearing, which can be either a good or bad
thing.

You can run 60 series tires (15" tires are cheaper!) and fill the fenders but 
car won't handle as well.

If you want the wheels for auto-x or track use (what I use my 15's for) you 
will probably want soft compound tires anyway.  

These wheels would be an excellent choice for competition.  They suport 
the tires better than 6&7's and the overall gearing will be reduced.  If 
the car is at euro ride height, the fenders don't look so empty [not that 
that's really a concern...].

I can't speak for a performance setup.  My 71T is pretty much stock
with Bilstiens in front and Koni's in back.  205/55/16's and Dunlop D40M2's.  
I just went on a SF to San Diego round trip.  My car could not
be confused with a refined roadgoing GT by any stretch of the
imagination.  It's loud and hard.  (As a data point, I have driven 2
74's and an SC which were orders of magnitude more refined and
comfortable.  So you've got to consider more variables than simply
supsension set-ups).

Most normal people (even Porsche owners, I suspect) would rather endure 
water torture than ride for long periods in my car.

I, on the other hand, loved every mile of the trip, and regreted returning
home when it was over.  (Bart Chambers would add:  "Quick, get the net
over him.  Where's the damn sedative??")

The verdict: YMMV.  It's too subjective a question.  I'd rather make a 
long roadtrip in a clapped out Beetle (have done same several times.  Drove over
the Shasta Mountains one winter with of course no defroster.  Heavy snow
freezing on the windshield.  Solution:  vacuum cleaner hose attached to the
footwell and directed to windshield.  Got some priceless looks from

Again YMMV.

Fitzpatrick expounds: "I imagin the later one would be nicer since they seem
to be quieter."

Sometimes, too quiet is not good. After years of driving a 356 and then a
914 2.0, I learned the fine art of using the engine note to help me heel and
toe (tells me if and when I blipped the engine between the double-clutch
downshift drill) and to tell me when to upshift. Never had the time to look
at the tach. Learned to trust my ear.

But now, in my 951, I can't hear anything - it's too quiet. All I get is a
faint whoosh and whine as the boost works and car squirts through traffic.
Can't even tell if I blipped the motor or not on downshifting. Very
disconcerting. If I ever drove the car in serious combat, I'm thinking about
putting a microphone next to the motor with a speaker in the cab. But on the
other hand, even with a sport suspension, its pleasant ride in sport seats
along with its silent progress at full chat still allows one to hear subtle
nuances on the CD player without turning up the volume. 

Recently got into a 911 for a few miles and, by comparison, thought it was
uncivilized and lacking in performance for all the racket it put out.

I used to routinely knock back 600+ miles in a single sitting in
my '81 Euro SC, then repeat same returning the following day. And 
never compromised on the performance issue.  Full hard shocks, 
sticky tires, etc. all the time. If you're into *DRIVING*  -- the 
actual going, not the being someplace, then it's a very enjoyable
road car. Give up on the "creature comforts" thing though; you'll
get wind noise, and exhaust noise, and engine noise, and won't hear
your stero or radar detector if you're driving in the well-over-the-
posted-speed-limit range.

The stiff suspension, etc, is not a big deal. If you want
a big deal, try doing the same in your 914 with 21mm front torsion
bars, 180 lbs rear springs and Konis set full hard on 50 series
tires.... Had to do that a few times too...

In the first year I owned the SC, I had two principal clients, located 
exactly 97 miles from each other (Houston is a BIG place). More than 
one day I had meetings at both the same day. 300 mile days just around
town were not uncommon. Did a total of 18K miles on that one car that 
year, plus another 7K on two other cars...

In general very, very sound advice. Unless you *want* an earlier car,
and there are many reasons to do so. It's ultimately a matter of taste.

All true... The big issue is that there just aren't any extremely high
milage 3.2s out there for "longitudinal studies". There have been 3.0s
since '78, so they are pretty well understood. However, in additional to
the hard mechanical reliability, there's a more important issue: the
fuel injection system.

As late as late '93 I still told people to get a '82-3 SC as the ideal
low maintenece 911. Since then, I've suggested a 3.2 Carrera, with
my personal preference being the '86 (915 trans, but "fixed" A/C system).
Why? Well, for most people, dealing with the CIS injection on the SC
is very very painful -- it's a hydraulicly operated mechanical system, 
and when anything in the control paths gets out of spec, it screws everything
up. The parts last a long time, but they're all getting old. So unless
you're prepared to spend the up to $2k to replace *EVERYTHING* when (not
IF, *WHEN*) it starts giving you trouble, you might want to avoid having
to deal with it at all. 

The 3.2, on the other hand, uses the DME controls which is a pulsed 
injection system. Things still go wrong, but it's a lot simpler to
diagnose, and cheaper to repair.

I have a  ton of wierd special stuff for tweaking and tuning CIS
left over from a mis-spent youth building sprint cars and dragsters
and stuff using Kinsler CIS. And, as a result, still like CIS for my
personal cars. But if you have to deal with it day in and day out, and
don't like screwing with it, the DME cars really, really, really are
simpler do deal with.

No problem on that! I had just over 150K miles on my '81 Euro SC when
I sold it in September, and those were *NOT* "non-violent" miles. There
is a ton of autobahn time on it, plus track time in the US, plus a 
pile of autoxes, plus I'm just hard on sports cars on the street...
You should be able to hit 200K with no problem on a 3.0. Like I
said, no one really knows on the 3.2, but I've seen 120K mile cars
that seemed to be fine...

Subject: re:  more 914 Engine Assembly questions 



    The motor moves smoothly until I bolt on the flywheel, then it is
    impossible to move.  I measured the endplay, ordered the correct shims,
    installed them & the o-ring, but when I torque the flywheel on, I can
    no longer turn the crankshaft.  At first I thought that the flywheel was
    rubbing against the outside edge of the main seal, but now I'm not sure.
    
Are you sure the shim you received is the one you ordered? You can check
this with a micrometer, and check the endplay with a dial indicator. I
know these are expensive but they are important for doing a proper rebuild
(i.e. necessary).

    Am I installing the o-ring in the correct place?  Is it supposed to get
    flattened?
    
No, it shouldn't be flattened. It goes in a recess in the flywheel so that
it can seal against the side of the crankshaft, not the end. It should
have no bearing on end-play, that is, it sould not be between the flywheel
and crank at their interface (the surface that the five bolts go through).

    What is the effect of having incorrect shimming? (I'm guessing)
    To thick of shims and you will have excess endplay.
    To thin of shims and the flywheel will rub the case and not be able to move.
    The above would describe the problem I may be having, but I seem to have
    followed the procedures correctly.  I've had friends help me verify
    everything.  Is there something I'm missing?
    
You've got it backwards. if the shims are too thick, you will have no or
less endplay. if they are too thin you will have excessive endplay.

Try tightening up the flywheel with one shim removed. if the crank turns
freely, your shims were too thick. Do the endplay measurement (preferably
with a dial indicator) with the two shims in place, subtract your desired
endplay from the measurement and that is your shim thickness needed. Of
course, you can only check your shim with a micrometer to see if you were
sent the right one. If you need another one, you should also order another
flywheel seal, as it is very difficult to change shims with the seal in
place and not nick the seal face. Unfortunately, if you remove it, chances
are high that it will be slightly warped. Either way, don't take the
chance, get a new seal.

I hope this helps,

Subject: Re: It's a boy! Now how do I get him into my 944?

Con,

The best solution I've seen starts with a child seat which has an
adjustable tubular U-section at the back.  The adjustment is one
which lets you rotate the U forward or back to set the seat angle.

But what you do is remove the U-section altogether.  The remaining
seat fits very nicely into a rear Porsche seat-lette.  I tried this
with our Century model 2000 STE seat, and it worked fine.

The bad news is that apparently this sort of design is no longer
employed because of the perceived risk of children catching their
fingers where the adjustable section meets the main seat frame.  It
may well be that the newer designs, whatever they may be, afford the
same "decontenting" and its benefit.

Porsche makes and sells kiddie seats in Germany, and presumably all
non-North American markets.  This is what we get for letting product
liability lawyers walk the streets.  They have a number of models,
and they look great.

By the way, I found that our US-legal infant seat fit fine in the
back of our car, as is.  It is only when you move up to the child
seats that fit seems to be a problem.

Subject: Important Safety Note

Folks,

This is for all of you who have air bags and children.  Do *NOT* seat
your children in the front seat, *particularly* in a rear-facing
infant seat.  If an air bag deploys, the child's head could be subject
to a force up to 300G's when the child is in such a rear-facing seat.
An adult head can withstand 80 G's, briefly; a child's head considerably
less.

This was covered in an article in the 9/93 issue of Automobile.  I
haven't since seen it mentioned anywhere else.

Subject: Loose Elec. mirrors on 911

Hello,

I saw a note on the porsche list that some people installed
the square looking electric mirrors on a 911.  I have
an 81 911 with these electric mirrors, and my drivers side
door mirror is very loose.  It is loose where the smaller
base part connects to the door itself, and also where the
mirror head part connects to the smaller base part.

Is there something I can do to tighten this mirror?  I was told
there is a special tool to install/remove this, since the
wires go up through the base.  To make the head part less
loose, I was going to go as far as wedging tinfoil or
wrapping a layer of cloth tape over its mounting post (assuming
I could remove or raise the head part enough to expose
the cylindrical mounting post).  Then pressing the head part
back over the post.  The cloth medical tape, or tinfoil, or
whatever, would take up the space and make the mirror
head snug again.  I have no clue what to do about the base
and do not want to buy another mirror as the car was just
painted, and the mirror was painted in this process.

What can I do to aleviate my loose mirror problems?

True.  My wife's 1990 Audi came standard with a red rear halogen fog lamp

Hello,

What is a fair $$ price for a set 4 of factory Porsche Fuch's rims 
with Pirelli P7's mounted and balanced on them, off of a 911?
The sizes are: 2 Rear - 15x8 and 2 Front - 15x7.  The rear tires have
about 1/8 inch of tread on them, and are slightly cracked from rubber
corrosion (ie:rear tires need replacing), while the front tires are close
to new in tread wear, and have no problems.  Two of the rims have curb 
scratches around the perimiter, but are not bent in any way.  I was told 
that these rims sell for over $1K each from the factory.

The scratches seem like they could be removed from light polishing, they 
are not gouges in the aluminum.  Can this be done myself with steel wool 
or something (the scratches are just on the outer lip of the rim, and 
are not deep)?  How much is this set of four fuchs worth?

Subject: re: 944 fog lamps


High intensity rear fog lamps are a mandatory requirement
for vehicles in most of the EC. Sadly, there appears to be
no mandatory requirement that vehicle drivers should have a
brain, or if they do have one that they should use it. The reason
I say this is that many drivers have the dual high intensity rear
fogs switched on in any conditions that are not 12 noon and bright
sunlight, thus it is common for the meterologically challenged to be
driving around in light rain in St. Albans town centre in early evening
with two powerful red searchlights projecting from the back of
their Mini Metro or other such rolling object. This results in
a great deal of blinding light and reflections in the wet road
surface. Any attempt to explain to the offending mouth-breathers
would result in a blank stare, a denial that their rear fogs are
on, a claim that they are perfectly entitled have them on if they
want, and probably the suggestion that a smack in the mouth sometimes
offends.

Of course, it is illegal to drive with the high intensity rear
fogs on in conditions that are not foggy, however, our traffic
police are unable to enforce this particular law because it
would unfairly discriminate against the meterologically challenged,
mouth-breathers, and the reto-crainially inverted. Also it would divert 
resources from important revenue generating tasks, such as maintaining 
GATSO machines, busting Porsche drivers for "possession of a bright red 
sports car in a public place with the intent to speed" and knocking off 
early for a few beers and 20 quid each way on Laughing Boy
in the 3:30 at Kemptown.

Thanks for the replies about the fog lamps.  I'm still wondering if anybody 
has in fact retrofitted them in a 944.

Another curious 944 question:  Has anyone used the empty spot below the 
radio to add any useful guages?  If so, is there a company out there that 
sells proper faceplate assembly to mount them there.  I haven't seen one 
specifically for the 944.  It seems like the normal 2-1/4" (I think) would 
fit, although I haven't measured.

Subject: re: 944 motor mounts

Nathan and P-philes:
Yes, I got the updated T mounts for $110. I included the part number
in my previous posting.  The updated part is much beefier than the 
original equipment.  

I changed mine this last weekend and this is what I found:

1) If you have an older 944 and it's vibrating, bite the bullet
and change the mounts.  It'll bring a tear to your eye.  The smoothness
is what this fine machine is all about.  The job is within reach
of the accomplished backyard mechanic, but requires some tools, skills,
and patience.

2) The right mount came out in two pieces.  They say to look for 
fluid leakage when examining a mount.  Mine showed no signs of leakage, 
it has apparently had NO fluid for nearly as long as I have owned the car.
To check the condition of your mounts, watch the right (exhaust) mount
while rev'ing the engine slightly.  The mount should compress nicely and the 
rubber will balloon slightly taking up the motion if it is OK.  Because of 
the weight of the engine it may "look" OK to the casual observer.  As a 
second check, fashion a [ shaped piece of stiff wire so that the points of
the wire are 60mm apart.  Use this gauge to measure the distance between
the top and bottom surfaces of the mounts.  If it is less, replace them.

3) My left mount "looked" OK but failed the measurement test, so I changed
both, and it sure is sweet!

Failure of the 911 automatic heater control is common.  Replacement is
about $600 which is what the dealer solution is.  I've got some
experience repairing these things which tend to fail in common ways.

1).  One of the two sensors may be bad.  The system works from two
     temperature sensors; one in the cabin and the other in the
     left side heat exchanger.  If one of these sensors fail the
     heat controller will either not work or go to full open depending
     on the failure mode.

     To check remove the control unit by undoing the four mounting
     bolts and unsnapping the control arm inside the unit.  Pop off
     the plastic cover on the right side of the unit to access the
     control arm.  Lift the unit up and remove the two white
     connectors at the rear.  These are the sensor inputs.  I can't
     remember which is the cabin and which is the heat exchanger
     but the cabin sensor will read approximately 1200 ohms at
     an ambient room temperature of about 65 degrees fahrenheit and
     the other will read about 150 degrees with the engine cold.  If
     the resistance reading is zero or infinity, the sensor must be
     replaced.

2)   Someone poured a beverage into the control unit or the contacts
     are dirty.  Beside the rheostat for the temperature selection are
     two microswtches.  In older models they are exposed, the later
     units utilized a sealed unit.  One controls "all closed" and the
     other "all open".  A spilled beverage, especially a soft drink,
     or accumulated grime will prevent these contacts from functioning.
     Clean them thoroughly with unlubricated electronic cleaner to
     remove any funk.

3)   The control rod became detached and caused the electronics board
     to fail.  Porsche obviously did not trust this unit as they left
     the heater control lever exposed.  Typically, this lever is pulled
     while attempting to get heat into the car.  If it is pulled
     hard enough the control rod will unsnap and wedge against the floor.
     When the heater control is activated the rod will
     be forced downward against the floor.  Porsche DID NOT fuse the
     unit separately with a low amperage fuse so one of the
     transistors on the board assumes the role.  I typically replace
     all four transistors.  Replace the two marked BD132/176 with
     2N5194 and the BD131/175 with 2N5191.  The case style of the
     transistors is TO-220.  The electronics board
     unplugs from the control unit.  It and the control switch
     platform can be obtained from the dealer for about $125 each.
     The four transistors should be less than $15 from an electronics
     parts house.  Replacement requires a low watage soldering iron and
     a few minutes time.

4)   While you're cleaning, wash down the two limit microswitches on the
     motor housing with electronic cleaner if the unit has exposed
     switch contacts.

A final warning to all 911 owners with automatic heat controllers.  If
the unit fails DO NOT attempt to use the heat control handle until you
pop open to plastic panel on the right of the heater control unit and
unsnap the control arm with an outward pull.  This will prevent item
three above from occurring and may prevent breakage of the control rod.
Remove the rubber cover from the front of the unit and use a coin or
screw driver to tighten the small bolt at the base of the heat control
lever.  This will apply enough friction to hold the lever open against
the heat box springs until you can repair the automatic unit.

>How tolerable is your 911 on long trips?

I drove from the Jungfrau region of Switzerland to North
London last May in about 9 hours including the Channel
ferry and getting a speeding ticket in France. I did not
exceed 155 MPH at any time, but in spite of that it
was a `tolerable' little 911 trip. The grin on my face from
redlining across Europe took about two days to wear off,
so I guess that I will be `tolerating' my 911 a little
longer. I still get flashbacks from the trip even now.

I would say that in general, the longer the trip in a 911
the better. I would also say the insane grin on the face
of a satiated 911 driver as he (or she) climbs out of the excellent 
sports seat at the end of a long, very, very fast drive across country, 
in the fading western sunlight of a hot summer evening, is a good 
indicator of the degree of pleasure that can be `tolerated' by the 
lucky driver.

I guess that the amount of 911 driving you can tolerate depends on how
high your pleasure threshold is!

    Interestingly enough, this isn't always the case.  At one point, I
needed a gasket for my oil filler on the 914.  After-market sources
in my immediate vicinity didn't have it.  So, I checked the local VW
dealer.  $8.00, and they'd have to order it--2 days to a week to get
it.  I needed it Right Away (don't we always?) so I checked at the
less-local Porsche/VW/Audi dealer.  Not only did they have it in
stock, but it was only $5.00...
    Moral:  check all sources, even ones that shouldn't have the most
reasonable prices--'cause they may!

I've taken my '72 on a few longish trips 3-4 hours.  I can get pretty
tiring, especially since I have pretty stiff suspension and its a little
loud.  I imagin the later one would be nicer since they seem to be
quieter.  I've taken mine several times from Sacramento to Santa Cruz,
with a surboard on top.  Talk about getting looks!

This is where the 914 may have an upper hand.
I've driven my 74 914 2.0L from Atlanta to the western suburbs of Chicago while 
only taking a break for an evening stop over.  The drive was smooth and quite 
comfortable. I was quite suprised (and pleased) to get both driving fun and 
comfort out of the same machine.  The total trip was roughly 13 hrs. not 
counting the stop for the night and it was done with only a tank and a half of 
fuel.

Our '83 911 has 70k miles, with stock suspension, but been lowered.  It's 
quite tolerable on long trips (for two people).  Firm ride but we don't find 
to too "hard" except on "washboard" roads.  In fact we prefer it to our 
Volvo 745T.  However, it is quite a bit louder than the Volvo (which is why 
I like it!).

Adjustable Koni's could be used for performance vs touring but the stock 
shocks are very good for all around use.

For the record:  (i) I don't like to pay a lot for wheels.
                        (ii) I don't like pirelli tires.

The *asking* price in Pano [which you already know since you *are* a PCA 
member aren't you?  ;-)  ] is in the $800 - $1200 range for non-perfect 
7&8x15's (for a set of 4).  They tend to be priced a bit higher individually.

I bought a set (of four) of 7&8x15 fuchs recently for $450.  One has a 
noticable cosmetic scratch.  The paint (anodizing?) is worn on all of them.  
They're not ugly but also not concourse.  These were advertised in Pano as
"track" wheels.  The asking price was $500/obo.  This set came without 
tires.

I have another set in slightly better condition that I bought several years 
ago, also for $450.   I got kind of lucky on these.  This set came with tires
I gave away on another set of wheels I was selling.

If the wheels are scratched I would not go over $800 for the set [remember,
I'm a cheap SOB].  A lot of it depends on how desperate you are.  You should 
find something for that price (or less) in Pano of you are willing to wait 
a few months.

The P7 has this nice belt delamination that (I believe) is not unsafe but
gives you this weird front end shimmy at around 65-70 mph.

Also, the only tire I've ever had blow out was a pirelli P3.  It had about 
1000 miles on it, had been properly inflated 3 day prior and was being 
driven at 65 mph.

Now I just say "no" and by Yoko's.

Now, why do you want new wheels?  An '81 'sc should have 6&7x16 fuchs.

If you run 50 series tires on the 15's they don't quite fill the fender wells.
You will also reduce the overall gearing, which can be either a good or bad
thing.

You can run 60 series tires (15" tires are cheaper!) and fill the fenders but 
car won't handle as well.

If you want the wheels for auto-x or track use (what I use my 15's for) you 
will probably want soft compound tires anyway.  

These wheels would be an excellent choice for competition.  They suport 
the tires better than 6&7's and the overall gearing will be reduced.  If 
the car is at euro ride height, the fenders don't look so empty [not that 
that's really a concern...].

I can't speak for a performance setup.  My 71T is pretty much stock
with Bilstiens in front and Koni's in back.  205/55/16's and Dunlop D40M2's.  
I just went on a SF to San Diego round trip.  My car could not
be confused with a refined roadgoing GT by any stretch of the
imagination.  It's loud and hard.  (As a data point, I have driven 2
74's and an SC which were orders of magnitude more refined and
comfortable.  So you've got to consider more variables than simply
supsension set-ups).

Most normal people (even Porsche owners, I suspect) would rather endure 
water torture than ride for long periods in my car.

I, on the other hand, loved every mile of the trip, and regreted returning
home when it was over.  (Bart Chambers would add:  "Quick, get the net
over him.  Where's the damn sedative??")

The verdict: YMMV.  It's too subjective a question.  I'd rather make a 
long roadtrip in a clapped out Beetle (have done same several times.  Drove over
the Shasta Mountains one winter with of course no defroster.  Heavy snow
freezing on the windshield.  Solution:  vacuum cleaner hose attached to the
footwell and directed to windshield.  Got some priceless looks from 
passersby :^) than a Honda Accord appliance-o-matic mobile.

Again YMMV.

Fitzpatrick expounds: "I imagin the later one would be nicer since they seem
to be quieter."

Sometimes, too quiet is not good. After years of driving a 356 and then a
914 2.0, I learned the fine art of using the engine note to help me heel and
toe (tells me if and when I blipped the engine between the double-clutch
downshift drill) and to tell me when to upshift. Never had the time to look
at the tach. Learned to trust my ear.

But now, in my 951, I can't hear anything - it's too quiet. All I get is a
faint whoosh and whine as the boost works and car squirts through traffic.
Can't even tell if I blipped the motor or not on downshifting. Very
disconcerting. If I ever drove the car in serious combat, I'm thinking about
putting a microphone next to the motor with a speaker in the cab. But on the
other hand, even with a sport suspension, its pleasant ride in sport seats
along with its silent progress at full chat still allows one to hear subtle
nuances on the CD player without turning up the volume. 

Recently got into a 911 for a few miles and, by comparison, thought it was
uncivilized and lacking in performance for all the racket it put out.

  I'm posting this for a friend.  Please email responses to "jal@mda.ca" and
  the porschephiles:
  
  
   This is a toughie...my mechanic has worked on my car four times over the
   last couple of years and hasn't figured out why my car does this.  The
   symptom is purely left-hand turns (never right-hand), and with throttle
   on slightly through the turn.  After nearly straightening out the car slows
   down abruptly (but engine keeps turning...with clutch in it idles).
   
   This makes turning left in front of oncoming traffic fairly exciting.  I'm
   not sure I'm going to make it!  My foot remains above the clutch ready
   to punch it in case the car slows.   After it happens a little goosing
   of the gas and the engine eventually revs up (two taps later.)  In straight
   lines and rh turns and many lh turns the car is terrific.
   
   The "fuel starvation" concept is all I've got to work with...because of
   the clutch thing I do not believe there is an ignition problem.
   
   If you have ideas, suggestions, procedures to follow or tests to make,

If it is tolerable on one or two hour trips you should also
like it for long trips.

I have taken my '81 Targa on a couple of long trips.  The
suspension is stock.  One trip was 2,000 miles in one week
from Oregon to Montana and back.  I stayed off the interstates
as much as possible (they are sooo boring ;-).  The seat is
very comfortable.  The only thing which drew my attention once
in a while was the steering which is light on center and a bit
heavy in the turns.  Other trips have been to California
including Yosemite and Sequoia Nat'l Parks.

On a long trip you do have to ignore the fact that your right
foot keeps wanting to go to the floor. :-)

Subject: How tolerable is your 911 on long trips?

The longest trip I've made was 18 hours. San Fran to Phoenix, about 800 miles.
I slept in the reclined passenger seat for two hours of that, after driving for
11 hours. I felt fine when I got to Phoenix. The trip was a 2000-2500 RPM
cruise due to engine problems. The 911 was a 76 S in standard trim.

     Speaking of wheel prices and getting slightly of the Porsche track.  I 
found a set of BBS RM 2-piece (basket weave type) that were original 
equipment on '92 2.0L GTI's.  I am wondering what fair market value would be 
depending on condition.
      (The rims are in pretty fair shape except two of them, which have met 
a bad fate with a pothole.  They are slightly bent/flat on the outside rim, 
but look like they could be set right.  Any advice, such as look elsewhere, 
etc., would be appreciated.)

Thanks,

     I have seen Fuch prices ranging from $50 to $250 per wheel. I didn't 
get
     to see them for these prices, but I bet you get what you pay for. I 
just
     sold a set of 4 6Jx15's for $400. They were in good to excellent 
condition.
     No curb marks, no dents, etc. If you look around you can find wheels 
like
     the ones I just sold for about the same price. I did also include the
     original ctr caps. Good hunting!!!

Subject: Re:It's a boy! Now how do I get him into my 944?

  Sorry to bother the list with this. My mail to Cornelius
  Verburg was returned as undeliverable.
  
  Con,
    
  I was in the same position back in March when my son was
  born.
    
  The first thing you need is a rear-facing infant seat. I live
  in Wash D.C. & here it is, I believe, against the law to have
  an infant facing forward.
    
  My wife & I went out to a baby store before Hugh was born
  & tried a number of different infant seats to see what would
  work. There were a couple that did fit but both resulted in
  my wife having to sit very far forward & upright in the front
  passenger seat. All I can say is that if you can put up with
  this hassle for a few months (3 or 4, in our case) then
  you've gotten over the worst.
    
  The next step is to find a real, forward facing child seat.
  Good luck to you. We couldn't find one anywhere.
    
  Instead, I remembered that while visiting the Porsche factory
  last year I had seen a Porsche made baby seat designed to fit
  the front & rear seats of 911's & 944/968s. I tried to order
  the seat through PCNA but they wont sell it here. I called
  up the factory but they won't sell it here because of
  contractual agreements with PCNA.
    
  I looked through some British Porsche magazines & called
  AFN, a large, reputable Porsche dealership next door to PCGB.
  They were very helpful & provided me with part numbers (the
  seat comes in three modules so that, as the child grows, the
  seat changes to keep pace. The seat is good until the child
  reaches about 70lbs), prices & so on. I ordered the seat
  through them & have been very happy with it.
    
  The part numbers for the seat are:
    
               000 802 02101 01    cushion
               000 802 03101 01    back rest
               000 802 04101 01    table
    
  The 'phone number for AFN is 011-44-81-742-7000 & their fax
  number is 011-44-81-742-7700. If you call tell them you're
  calling from overseas & want to talk to the parts manager
  (Derrick, when I last called). They tend to move pretty
  quickly with long distance calls.
    
  I hope this is of some use. Perhaps you'll be lucky & find a
  seat locally? If you'd like more info about the Porsche seat
  just ask.
    
  Good luck with your new son!

It's a turbo diesel, designed by Dr. Prof. Ing. Bentschaft Kiboshki, whose
last great work was the 912 diesel.

In a more serious vein, the AP article says that it *MAY* get a hybrid
diesel/electric setup like Porsche the Elder designed for Lohner in 1903...

Of course, they don't *TELL* you that this is the first instance of the
design, but my encyclopedic knowledge of the little known and the 
little cared about had that on ready recall...

Hi, Larry.

I believe this Dr. Prof. Bentschaft Kiboshki is the

VW Vanagons. A real pulse-pounder of a machine:
it could come *that* close to out draging a 
three-wheeled Yugo. Downhill.

Subject: Post track recovery questions and clueless drivers


Hi All;

Well it has been two weeks since the final driver's ed event of the year for PCA 
Potomac region at Summit Point.  It was my first driver's ed with the new (to 
me) 951 S.  What an experience.  I am already preparing for next season.  If 
anyone wants to buy me a Christmas present I need a harness bar, two harnesses, 
4 track wheels with racing tires and maybe a chip or sport exhaust.  That should 
do.

Back to reality.  What maintenance do you fellow porschephiles typically perform 
on your cars after track events.  This car is my daily driver as well as my 
track car.  The weekend after the event I bled the brakes and added Castrol GT 
LMA brake fluid.  Since the event I have noticed an increase in oil consumption 
(Mobil 1 15W50).  I went throough about two quarts the weekend of the event and 
have had to add another quart in the 500 miles or so since.  Before tracking it 
I would use about 1 quart every 1500 miles.  Oil was changed to Mobil 1 about 
2300 miles ago.

BTW, did any of you notice the number of clueless drivers on the road over the 
Thanksgiving weekend?  Left lane discipline in this country is ridiculous, even 
when traffic is light.  People seem to think that doing 65 in the left lane with 
nobody in front of you is a right.  A car wishing to go faster can just wait 
until the slower driver feels like moving over, if at all.  I usually give 
someone slower in front of me about ten seconds of open right lane before 
passing on the right.   I know they see me in their mirrors, but they just do 
not seem to care.  Also, the number of drivers with poor speed/distance 
judgement is amazing.  You can be overtaking someone going 10-15 mph faster than 
them but they will still pull out in front of you to pass slower right lane 
traffic.  And then they pass SLOWLY.  It is very frustrating to constantly have 
to go in and out of cruise control because of other drivers inconsiderate 
actions.

I feel better now.  It's already been a long week.

Before each DAY on the track (can be done before leaving home on Day One):

* change oil and filter
* bleed brakes, siphoning out fluid in reservoir first
* check tires, pressure, ball joint and wheel bearings play
* visual inspection of everything

After I get back:

* change oil and filter
* visual inspection of everything

Some may say this is overkill, but your car will love you for it.

How true, one in the same. Bentschaft also adapted, for the 924, his
original design of the non-whipping driveshaft first used on the Pontiac
Tempest. It was bent in the middle, thus preventing the whipping action and
allowed the Tempest to win its one and only TransAm race.

I AM serious AND sincere, even if I don't mean it. I read it was going to be
a turbo diesel. Wanna bet? How about a bottle or two of Blitz, in Portland,

Speaking of track events after the Peachstate Driver's Ed I've noticed
that my car is making sort of a grumbling sound in the front end.
I've checked and adjusted the wheel bearings but the sound persists.
 
Could it be a warped rotor ? The brakes feel O.K. no pulsating etc.
But the frequency changes with speed of the car. It is most noticable at 
lower speeds (<15 m.p.h.) and slightly louder when turning.
Any suggestions?

Hmmmmm..... you assume that because the motor is in the front, it must be air 
cooled....this brings up an issue I've always pondered re: pcars and vw/ac 
cars.... If the car goes forward most of the time...all that fast moving 
air(cooling capacity) is in the front. Why then did God put the motors on our 
favorite cars in the back, where one has to back up real fast to be cool??? 
The concept does seem to work however and they are fun to drive, but.....in 
the beginning......  Is this a chicken or the egg thing?  I usually have 
better things to ponder but it's been a slow news day.. later,

Subject: comfort, porsche sightings

As much as I love my 71 911 Targa, I must admit that it has been very
noisy compared to my RX-7.  My ears ring for a while after long trips,
although that is partly because I crank the stereo up real loud so I can
hear it.  At least I am able to save money not having to buy a good tape
deck :-)

Hopefully the motor will be quieter after being rebuilt.

Still am not sure whether or not to bite the bullet and tackle
the transaxle while it's out. Syncros at least, maybe pinion bearings
as well since there is a bit of a howl (but I guess it could be 
also be the wheel bearings?).

The seats are quite comfortable, as long as I take my wallet out
and put it in the glove box.

On a different note, I was startled to see someone driving a nice 911 in
horrific traffic in Istanbul a few weeks ago.  Any other Porsche
sightings in out-of-the-way places?

Subject: A cooler 931?

Hi.

In studying my latest Porsche book (924 & 944 by Nigel Edwards), I noticed
that the 924 Carrera GT (awesome car) has an intercooler installed in the
area between the hood and the camshaft cover.  The intercooler actually
replaces the upper pressure pipe which leads from the turbocharger to the
throttle body.  

Unfortunately, only 406 924 Carrera GT's were ever made - none coming to the
US - which means that the chances of finding a used intercooler assembly is
pretty remote.  I would like to fit an intercooler on my 1980 924T - the
Porsche factory original seems like the best choice - so if anyone knows
where I can find one (at a reasonable price...), please let me know.
Alternatively, if anyone has fitted an intercooler in some other location (a
la 944 Turbo), details of this would be much appreciated. 

By the way, I have kept my car fairly stock - the only additions being an
air/fuel ratio guage (a MUST for any turbo car), a VDO Boost guage and a
"dial-in-boost" which allows the boost to be upped "slightly"  :-)  
My car has 80000 miles on it now - has the M471 suspension with the 928
brakes and 5 stud rims.
