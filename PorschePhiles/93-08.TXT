I'll be there, as will Nathan Ulrich and Jim Selders.  This will be a
shake-down day for the reborn engine in the race car.  And we have new
artwork on the car courtesy of my lovely, charming, and talented sister-
in-law.

And while on that subject, I remember there were a slew of porschephiles
at last year's HVR event at LRP.  Absolutely excellent event, and this
year's looks to be more of the same.  It's Aug 5th.  Anyone else going?

This is actually not that weird at all.  If you use velocity stacks, ie,
no common plenum, you can pretty much kiss a useable manifold pressure
signal goodbye.  The Haltech system works fine, for example, with just
a throttle position signal.

Subject: re: 911 camber

[Sorry for the bandwidth.  Steve, I cannot get a reply to you directly.]

    In response to your question, no I did not replace my spring
    plates with Sway-away (I assume those are the "adjustable
    aftermarket spring plates?).  Do you think that my spring
    plates might be the problem?  I have thought about swapping spring
    plates from side to side to see if this would change my camber
    readings.

Steve -

The reason I asked about the Sway-Aways was that we recently had a similar
problem with them.  When you buy them, they do not ship you new
eccentrics.  However, the bores in their plates are radiused to some US
(ie, inch) diameter, and not to the original metric diameter.

I'm not sure what your problem is.  Could be the control arm.  Could be
that your car was hit and repaired at some point.  You only get a little
over a degree of camber adjustability, as you probably know by now.  If
you lower the car, you will probably have a hard time getting the
camber you want unless you also revise the rear control arm's pick-up
on the cross member.  The factory did this on their  911, 924, and 944
race cars.  There are pictures, I think, in Bruce Anderson's book.

You may want to check the car's frame for true on a Celette or similar
machine.  Let me know what you learn; I'm learning too!

This isn't too surprising.  Bear in mind that when the factory bumped the
rev limiter a couple hundred RPM for the 911 Club Sport in the late
80's (87 or 88?), they used different springs.  Quite simply, if you
run your engine higher than it was built to be run, there is the real
risk of valve float.

Was the chip your friend added something like the Autothority, which
raises the rev limiter?  This "internal memo" you refer to, was it a
tech bulletin, or can you otherwise point me to it?

Subject: Heat shield #


I have the opportunity to get a new heat shield for the bottom of
my 1987 951.  The dealer will agree to replace it for me because it
was cracked when I bought the car.  All I really need is a part 
number (short of crawling under the car) and they will look it up
and give me wholesale $$$.  Does anyone have a list with the part 
numbers for this type of stuff.

Once I get the money I want to attempt to fix it. Is it possible to
patch a heat shield?  It is probably just a stainless plate right?

Thanks,

What heatshield do you mean. There are a bunch of them under and around the 951 
(like at the motor mount..).There is also a heatshield attached to the proximal 
1/3rd of the catalytic converter that can not be replaced, but is a frequent 
cause of noise as it tends to rust and "buzz".

I haven't crawled under there to see what one is cracked and rattling.
My mechanic put new motormounts in last week and noticed that it was
cracked but I was in too much of a hurry and didn't get the part # from
him. I do know that it was probably cracked because of a spent motor
mount and that it is about $150 from my dealer.

Subject: 944 Air Conditioning Problem

Greetings-

I have an '83 with chronic A. C. problems.  The latest is that the
system cycles on (for about 10 seconds) and off (for about 15 seconds)
much too often.  I had the system checked by an A. C. shop,and they
said the system was full, not leaking, and putting out properly cold
air.  They thought it might be an amplifier that needed to be
adjusted or replaced, but it would take at least 1.5 hours of labor
to check it out since it is up behind the dash.

Given that I don't know much about this shop, and the last time
someone took the system apart the car was down for over a month,
I decided to do a bit more investigation on my own.  I should add
that the last problem turned out to be a plugged expansion valve,
which in turn took out the compressor seals (which were not the
same as the Porsche rebuild kit, and thus had to be found through
an o-ring distributor).  This all happened about two years ago.

Anyway, I have both the 924 and 944 factory manuals, and can find
no mention of an amplifier (or an adjustment that seems related to
anything like this).  Has anyone got any ideas what the problem may
be, or of there is really something like an amplifier that can be
adjusted?

Thanks,
John

Some of each. Mainly safety and luxofat. And remember, the long-life
body was going on-line at that time as well. There was a significant
weigh gain with that transition.

You want the spec books. They're about $10 each, available at your
friendly neighborhood dealer or aftermarket supplier. Since Performance
Products has a 15% sale going on now to people on their mailing list,
I just ordered the ones necessary to fill in my set. And with Automotion
having their 4-day sale (Aug. 17-20) at 20% off, this would also
be a good time for stocking up on such things.

I don't know what is ment by "amplifier".Is your car equipped with automatic 
climate control ? There should be a quarter size "grill" to the right of your 
dash that has a temperature sensor. If a temperature is selected, the thing 
seems to react too sensitive, switching the AC on and off way too often. I have 
the same problem and sometimes it helps to turn the temperature control all the 
way down to maximal cool. I am looking forward to other porschephile experiences 
and comments.

I don't know of any reason not to do it, but I have this gut feeling that
it's not a good idea... You'd need all manner of solvents and stuff to clean
it at low pressure, too. As much as I hate to say this, it might be worth
considering finding a detailing service that handles Porsches and which will
provide you with references from other satisfied late 911 owners, and then
letting them do the whole car. A friend (who usually keeps his car *VERY*
clean) just had his done, and it made a huge difference...

>My car it seems had a number of tires (6 plus?) mounted over the last
>25,000 miles. The tires that the previous owner insisted on purchasing
>(Donlup D40/M2 front: 205/55Z/16R rear: 225/50Z/16R) 

I bought a set of four tires for my 911 in April, 1990. I have since that
date purchased two additional sets of rear tires, but still have over
half the tread left on the fronts. My conclusion: I get to buy a set
of rear tires every year, like it or not.

>I would be inclined to conclude that the tread-ware is very high (he did not
>mind paying list $price$ and often, I DO)

Something else to consider: it's a very high performance sports car, and
when you put tires in the "ultra high performance" catagory on it, they're
not going to last anywhere near like the "high milage sedan" tires you
might be used to buying for other cars. You *JUST WON'T* get 45,000 miles
out of a set of tires on a 911, and still have it drive like a 911. Those
high milage tires are *HARD* and don't stick very well. Not what I want
on my sports car (or sedan either, but that's a different story...)

On price, I routinely purchase locally tires at the same discount price
I'd pay for them via the Tire Rack. You need to know what the "real" 
(i.e. Tire Rack) price is before you start shopping, and when someone
says "Oh, that's $275 a tire" you can with good authority say "Well, I 
can get it from the Tire Rack for $180 plus $8 shipping. Do you want my
business?" And the Discount Tire and NTW stores locally that work with
the Porsche club just give you that price (or better, some days) when
you call up and say you're with the club. No hassles, no mess. Just lower
prices.

>What would you falks use if you were replacing all four. Can I do with replacing 
>just two at a time to another tire type (eg. BFG, Dunlop P8000...)

I *LOVE* the AVS Intermediates I've been running for the last 3.5 years.
Even for track days and autocross, they're perfectly acceptible (you do
give up a bit to the guys on the A008s and TA R1s, though). Can't really
comment about how well the other tires work, but I have driven A008RS,
A008P, and Michelin XGTVs on friend's 911s. The A008RS stick really, really
well in the dry, but don't work well in the rain; the A008P is really
an even bigger compromise tire (not as good in the dry as the RS, and
not enough better in the wet to make up for it); and the XGTVs are just
too hard and un-sticky for me. Until I get to the point where I can either
have a live-in mechanic who will get up early and change my tires for
the weather, or can have two 911s around the house (one for wet, and one
for dry), I'll keep using the AVS Intermediates.

Subject: Car seat that fits


Hi Group,

Yesterday my search ended with a car seat that fits in the rear seats of my 
928s.  Momma and the two kids now fit fine.

The unit is a Champion/Scout Mdl 225142J1 from Evenflo.   It has a small base 
and angles well into the ridiculous rear seat.   The also have a tether strap 
and anchor assembly to tie it back to something solid since a impact sense 
seat belt is not optimum.  I also secured it around the seat to keep it from 
rocking around.  
                                           
Regards,  Steve

Competitive 944s in CS?? I'll leave that one go for now...

Totally agree with you about gearing changes -- however, that wasn't mentioned
in the original note. My point was at achieving a lower center of gravity, or
lowering the car, by reducing the diameter of the tires (or wheels), versus
properly setting ride height thru suspension changes.  On my 911, I've done
both.

If by increasing your tire pressure you "balanced" the car's handling, i.e.,
corrected a slide problem, you actually were gaining contact patch. A tire
with insufficient air for strong side load conditions deforms the tread in an
"S" sort of shape where the outside of the tread grabs and the inner part
folds or cups and loses contact. By increasing pressure the tire better
maintained it's shape and had a larger contact patch.

In Autocross a wider contact patch is more effective whereas in high speed
track conditions a longer contact patch is usually preferred (if you can only
have one or the other). In both, short sidewalls are best. My comments on "if
you are tracking the car" referred to a high speed track, sorry for the lack
of clarity.  Anyway, this all is of course is IMHO...

Nuff' said...

So do you run any national level Solo II in your 944? Going to Salina by any
chance?

Subject: 944: Tire question


Hi again folks,

Some background:
	I currently have BFG 215/60-VR15 R1 road race tires
	on 7 X 15 standard "Phone Dial" wheels on my 1987
	944.

I have used up most of the tread on these tires and need to
get a new set before I can go to my next track event, but
BFG doesn't manufacture these size tires. However, they do
make the 225/50-15 R1 tires.

My question is, can I substitute the 225/50-15 tires for
the 215/60-15 tires on the standard Porsche 7 X 15 Phone
dials ?

The 225/50 has 10mm more section width than the 215/60,
which means that it will "stick out" more on the 7 inch
wheel than the 215/60 tire. Will that cause any problems ?

The 225/50 also has a lower aspect ratio (50) than the
215/60 (60), which will give me more clearance to the
fender (which I could use since I lowered the car by about
1.5 inches), and reduce the overall tire diameter (a little
better acceleration I hope).

Any information, help or ideas would be much appreciated.

thanks,

nabi

Subject: Re:: 911 trim clips

     As it turns out, the later 911 rear reflector panels ARE
held on by spring clips.  I don't know when they changed over
from studs/nuts.  Stronger prying finally popped one loose, it
turned out the one I first worked on was the tightest.  Anyway,
the distorted sheet metal around the holes into which the clips
snap, is easily tapped back into shape, and the new panel mounts
reusing the same 10 clips.  Thanks for the help.

79         "          "

* Canadian model (no US model listed)

All others are US models.

ROW 911sc is 2552 for '78-'81.

ROW Turbo is 2860 for '78-'81.

Oh yeah, these are WEIGHTS in pounds!


Tires:

I've been running A008's on my 911sc.  They are very nice (slow down when
wet!) california tires since it doesn't rain here.

They have the distinction of being the only tire I've ever truly had 
hydro-plane, as in **not** on the pavement **at all**.  A freeway drain
had clogged ('cause it hadn't rained in 6 months!), the lane was flooded
about 6"-10" deep, and I hit it at about 60.

Steering got very light.

I run A008rs's for auto-x.  I've also run the BFG R1's.  Both are nice, 
but more or less outside the query range  (expensive and not a good
"all around" tire).

My intention for the next set (comming up soon) is to get the hardest,
cheapest (per mile), longest wearing tires I can find.  I push the car
very hard when auto-xing, but not that hard otherwise (well, perhaps
the occasional off-ramp), and don't really feel the need for that much
(say 10% greater) stick for a 50%-100% increase in cost/mile.

Currently intended choice is Falken (comments/suggestions appreciated!)

I will not buy Pirelli tires under pretty much any circumstances.

I had a P3 (new and propperly inflated) blow out once and the P7 gets 
this nice belt delamination and shimmies at about 65.  I have had 
friends say nice things about the P6 tho'.


Here's a query:

There is a company called (I think) Diamond Back Tire Systems(?) that
makes retread race tires.  I called them a year ago wondering if they
built anything for auto-x.  They don't, but they do make some 16"
(retread) street tires.  205/55-16 were about $50 and 225/50-16 about
$75.  Imagine, a set of rubber for $250!

So, does anyone know the current state of retreads?  Are they safe to
use?  These people are producing race tires, so does this indicate 
that they have a reliable process, or just the opposite (no DOT) ?

I'm always dubious of things that seem to good to be true!

 914 Hot Idle
Hello, again.  More FI questions.
    My 914/1.8L (Jan. 74) has a problem with idling when the engine is hot. 
The 100+ degree temps this weekend really brought that out to me.  After it ran
for a while (30+ minutes), the idle went to hell.  In fact, it would stall if I
let it, after turning so slowly that the oil pressure light flickered on.  Is
this "normal" behavior for these poor beasties?  Is the problem that the engine
is just getting *too hot*?
    Any advice appreciated!

Subject: 911 Camber

    Kevin,

    Thanks for your comments.  I swapped out my driver's side trailing
    arm for the original one I had around and it seemd to help a lot
    (I also swapped around spring plates - driver's side to passenger,
    etc.).  My camber problem seems to have been at least partialy
    solved (at least now I have negative camber on both sides).  My
    guess is that the car I got the trailing arms off of was hit and
    most likely bent the arm, thus srewing up the camber on my car.

    Kevin, or any one else, do you know an easy way to check camber?
    Any idea what the settings on a lowered car should be?  A
    track/street car?  Any comments are apprecaited.

    Also, I am planning on putting 22mm torsion bars on the front of
    my 1971 911.  I have 26mm bars on the back.  Is this the "trick"
    set up or is is there something better?


    Thanks

Subject: 944T a/c

I have had a faulty A/C hose in a 944 turbo. The hose that leaks runs
from the condensor to the compressor. I have been investigating the
cost of repair at a series of dealers. I have never gotten the same price 
twice. There is even a dispute as to the current part number. As best I
can tell it is either 944.573.097.11 or 944.573.197.09. The price for
the part has varied from $135. to $230. This is a very large spread. 
I am advised that it will cost 2.7 hours to install, plus cost of freon.
I have several questions that I would like help with. 
What is the correct part number?
What is the correct price?
Can I install it myself?
Is there anything else I need to know?

Subject: 944 transmission & H2O pump

Hello again,

More news on our Porsche mechanic maintained automobile.  When I broke
five teeth on the ring and pinion gear in the differential (any one else?)
the mechanic working on the car cross threaded the bolt into the coupling
on the transmission.  Some of you might know that this coupling needs
to be balanced, and the fix is not always simple.

BTW, this was discovered in dropping the transmission to fix a gas tank
filler problem.  Which, by the way, requires a specially formed 
ventilation hose.

For those of you wondering about the water pump replacement, the nylon
toothless gear that is used for adjustments appears to be the weak link.  The 
auxiliary shaft belt started 'singing' (_very_ high pitched) and we
were able to find the problem before the engine timing belt went, too.

Disclaimers:  I am an engineer, not a mechanic.  This is Paul's car, I have
only had the opportunity to mess with it occasionally.  Any one who can explain
this better, please do so.  

Any one who knows how to get Porsche to pick up the tab on parts
damaged by their mechanics, please let us know.

Hmmm. Usually one of three problems:

1) vapor lock, or near vapor lock, from the fuel pump overheating. The
   real fix is to move the pump to the front trunk a la the '75-6 cars.
   The best way to do this involves using the same '75-6 access plate so
   you can get to the pump at will. Several people sell kits, which are
   basicly hose, clamps, standoffs, ty-wraps, and instructions in a big
   zip-lock bag. These kits are for bolting the pump to the firewall
   under the tank (i.e. you have to take the tank out to mess with the
   pump). Since you should do this anyway to keep from pinching fuel hose
   this isn't a terrible idea, but hey... My preference is to replace the
   *pump* with a late model, then move it to the front. You get a fresh
   new pump that works right with the hoses in the car (you don't have to
   do this bogus 3-way connector to take the pressure return and pump pressure
   return both back to the tank). Anyway, I digress....

2) cylinder head temp sensor, which fails with some regularity and usually
   the symptoms of "car runs fine until it gets to hot, then just stops".
   Quick check for this is to pour a cold soda on the sensor then re-start
   the car. If it re-starts, it's the sensor. If not, then your engine is
   now all sticky and gooey in addition to not running... 8{P

3) air temp II sensor is confused, showing air temp to be higher than head
   temp. This shuts off the fuel in a *BIG* hurry....

Fortunately, this is a cheap fix. If all three are wrong, and you use my
plan for replacing the pump then moving it, you still won't spend over $220
in parts... If you just move your old pump and buy a kit from someone (~$50)
for moving the pump, it's under $100. Good luck!

Subject:  Rare Porsche in Seattle!

Hi Group,

OK, I just returned from Seattle where I stumbled upon an amazing collection of
cars.  One in particular, may be the rarest Porsche I've ever seen.  This Porshe
was of the open-wheel single seater variety.  The owner of all these cars,(I
didn't even get his name) told me it was a "Pooper"(may have been Cooper).  Have
any of you heard of this car?  The owner told me it participated in races with
the 550 Spyders and that there are only two in the United States.  He bought
this one from the previous owner who also resides in Seattle, while the other
one is on the East Coast somewhere.  Does anyone know how much this car might
be worth?  

Other Porsches in his collection worth noting were, one Carrera Speedster(not
sure of the year), one 1955 Speedster, one 1955 Speedster awaiting restoration
since this guy discovered it in a barn (the owner has pictures of it in the barn
to prove it), one 1959 Carrera Coupe, two or three 1964 or 65 Cabriolets, and
at least 10 to 15 356C's(some SC's).  He said this was only one third of his
collection.  They were all in his repair shop.

Two other car's worth mentioning were a late model VW Bug with a (please don't
cry) Carrera GT engine in it.  He says it flies, but his wife won't let him
drive it any more because he spends too much time tuning it.  The other car(van)
was a Vanagon with a 930 Turbo engine installed in it.  Wow, what a sleeper!
He said he likes it because he can set the cruise control, while towing his
boat, and it won't slow down going up steep hills.

The collection was truly amazing.  If your ever up in Seattle, you've got to
stop by this guy's repair shop.  Its called AKERS Porsche Repair and its on
Broadway Ave..  Or you can wait till next year's Vintage Races at Laguna Seca.
He said he's bringing the "Pooper"(I hope its really called a "Cooper")

There are a number of DIY alignment tools sold by Pegasus Auto Racing

I have tried neither; there's a Hunter alignment machine in the shop.

Ah yes, the Pooper.... It's a Cooper with a Porsche engine, hence "P + ooper"
equals, of course, "Pooper". Had a pretty amazing history. Reference
"Excellence Was Expected" and "Porsche: Portrait of a Legend" for details.

As to what it's worth, who knows?  Documented cars of such rarity can have
astounding prices *IFF* anyone wants to buy them. For instance, original
unrestored 904s are selling in the $400K plus range, but 962Cs -- even with
spectacular race histories are only selling for $250-300K. And the last time
a 917 sold, it was over $4.2 million.

Common on cars that have set idle for a long time, or that have been
inadequately maintained. Change the brake hoses, flush the system,
and see how that works. You will in all probability need to rebuild
the calipers and replace the master cylinder in short order anyway,
so you might want to do it NOW while you do the hoses and flush to
save a few steps. BTW, 912 front brake caliper rebuild kits seem to be 
the same as 356SC rears, and 912 rears are 356SC fronts. Not that this
will necessarily do you any good to know, but hey, it's a PorschPhile 
Phactoid...

Brake fluid is both hygroscopic (i.e. absorbs water from atmosphere)
and a solvent (in particular, will dissolve rubber over time). A *BAD*
combination to allow to sit in your brake system unused for years. In
practice, the heat in the brake system under usage keeps the water from
being a problem (i.e. it evaporates before it corrodes parts) but you need
to change the fluid with some frequency (every N years, where 1 <= N <= 5,
depending on who you listen to) and you will need to change your brake hoses
over time as well. If you don't, well, now you *know* what happens...

Steve mentioned the Porsche powered car called the "Pooper"

It really was called the "Pooper" for Porsche/Cooper.  The other one
is owned by John Mueller of Kansas City.  I saw it run last year at
a vintage race (I forget which one, CHR?).  Anyway the car is pretty
nice, but he has not got all the bugs sorted out and has been
running his Tojeiro Climax lately.

I would guess that a completely restored Pooper could sell in the
$200K plus range, although in this soft market it is hard to tell.

I talked with a fellow had just purchased a 550 Spyder at the Monaco
auction and although he did not specifically state what he paid, I
got the impression that he paide 250-300K...much less than they were
going for a year or two ago.

It is indeed the legendary and notorious Pooper, built with Ken Miles's

the late fifties. The car pissed off the Porsche people to no end 
because the 550 spyders had to run against it and weren't as fast.
There was only one Pooper ( Porsche 4-cam in a Cooper). 
The Trans-Ocean Special of George Follmer's was a mid sixties imitator
that was equally successful.
Note that the Porsche-blessed Elva-Porsches were the factory's way of

I think you should all know that there are some addresses out there
which fail from time to time. Right now, it's hard to get to Scott Jessen
(sjj@chevron.com) but that will hopefully be fixed soon. There are others
which phase in and out, near as I can tell based on who's manning the
watch on their network connection (even Phil Katz falls off-line somedays!)

I only sanction people who consistently have their addresses fail for several
days, usually requiring 3 in a row, not including a weekend. I usually send
a note to the Postmaster (mail administator) at the site in question. Then
if I don't get satisfaction, I drop the offending address. I never sanction
people who send mail to failing addresses, so Phil is safe (for now -- heh heh

I'm also planning on uploading Bart's files to the Porschephile archives
hopefully making it a bit easier for some to access them. I'll send out a

The Monterey Historic Races are at Laguna Seca, August 20 - 22,
so if you heard someone would be driving a 917/30 at Laguna, I'd
guess this is the event.  I'm going, but I haven't seen a driver list.
Also worthwhile if you'll be out there anyway,  is the Pebble Beach
Concours (Pebble Beach is only about 5 miles from Laguna Seca),
held the few days before the Historic Races.  Pebble Beach is THE
premier concours, and you'll see examples of just about any
legendary car you can dream up.  The drool factor is really high
in Monterey that week.  Good luck getting a room, though.

I'm not sure how we got our tickets for the Historics, but the
first place to try is SCRAMP (Sports Car Racing Assoc. of the
Monterey Peninsula) at 408-648-5111.  They handled all the tix
for the IMSA races, and I think they handle all tix for Laguna Seca.

If you're going, the grandstands at Turn 11 are really good seats,
because you can see all of Turn 9 (downhill left-hand sweeper
coming out of the corkscrew) Turn 10 and Turn 11 (1st gear hairpin
where lots of really creative passing occurs, leading onto the
straight) and the whole straight into Turn 1.

I saw Stucky win at Laguna Seca, two weeks ago in a 911 3.6 Turbo
in the IMSA Supercar series, and then two hours later he drove a 944
in the Firehawk endurance series.  I couldn't stay for the end of the
endurance race, but he was the second driver of the car, and he was
picking up one place every two laps, so he should still know the track
really well by the end of August.

As a person who just redid the carpet in my '70 911T I can say that
installing carpet isn't too bad just:

a) Examine carefully and MARK all of the old carpet before you remove
it.  It's sort of like a 13 piece jigsaw puzzle if you don't (personal
experience!).

b) Verify that you have the proper year carpet to install.  They are not
the same.

c) Remove all the trim and put all the screws in plastic bags, LABELED.
I'm still looking for the screws for my driver trim plate.

d) Have LOT'S of carpet glue, the heavier the better.  I used spray
adhesive (egad!) and was careful.  It took me three and a half cans to
get the job done.

e) Test fit everything first!  Glue sticks real fast.

f) Start with the center hump, then door sills, then rear seat area,
etc., finishing up with the floor and the rear of the seats.  Mine came
out excellent!

I bought mine from Original Fit, 5179 Brooks St #C, Montclair CA, 91763

I took it ('70 911T) to my local (or loco) dealer and they said it was

was still there.  I took the car to Tuffy (I love my local Tuffy shop).
They said it was glazed rotors, and resurfaced them.  Problem went away

Finally, during some recent body work, I bought two caliper rebuild kits

Is your squeal my squeal?  Seeing how the turbo's brakes are larger and

Hi all,

Is there anyone who can help me with a procedure for degreeing the
cam for my 914 2.0l. Can I use a standard degree wheel(ie. one used
for a chevy that bolts to the crank snout) or do I need a special
wheel designed for VW use?

With the crank at TDC, where should the 0 degree mark on the wheel be?
At the case seam, or is there a mark somewhere I'm missing?

What about the timing marks on the crank and cam gears? My manual says
to line up the two marks on the crank gear with the case seam and the
one mark on the cam gear should mesh between the other two. But with
this method the crank isn't at TDC when starting. Should these marks
line up with the case seam while the crank is at TDC for no. 1?

Can anyone help end my confusion?

To any Porschephiles that love 914's:

I have a blue '72 that I need to get rid of because my storage
space is being reclaimed. I bought it as a parts car but, the only
things I needed was the drivetrain and wheels and tires. Everything
else is still intact and in *very* restorable shape.

The bad spots on the car include:

 - The pan needs to be patched under the seats or replaced
 - The drivers window doesn't roll up (although I can hear it trying)
 - There is some rust attack to the battery tray area but the frame
  still looks solid. Just the sheet metal between the frame and battery
  is shot.
 - Rear trunk lid has some surface rust and the trunk floor has a rust
  hole that needs to be fixed.

The good points on the car:

 - All the glass is there and in great shape.
 - The body panels are straight, the hood is perfect!
 - The seats and interior pieces are in good shape.
 - This car came with A/C so there's a condenser up front with the
  lines running to the back.
 - The suspension looks pretty good (the car had fifty something thousand
  miles before becoming a parts donor) the shocks are blue--Bilsteins
  I think??
 - I'm not asking a bunch for this tub compared to what I've seen here on
  Porschephiles.


I've tried to give a realistic decription of what kind of shape this car
is in. If you have any other questions I can be reached by phone at:
(504) 899-9998 or e-mail to:  tcbh000@music.tcs.tulane.edu

I suspect it will cost $600 to $850 to get this tub depending on your
location.  I'm willing to deliver the car in the U.S. if you'll agree
to cover the gas costs(partial up front) and cross my palm with $500
when I get it there. I have a flatbead trailer to use and a small truck
to tow it with so gas costs should be reasonable; again depending on
how far away you are from me. Of course, YMMV. If anyone is interested
*PLEASE* respond promptly as my storage situation will be changing soon
and I can't swing renting garage space.

Porsche 951 boost gages really stink.  Look at .8 bar and you'll notice
it's about 1/8" from 1 bar.  I've also noticed a large amount of
variation (from -0.1 to 0.2) bar indicated (guessing on the negative
side) with the motor off and ignitions on, obviously true is 0.0.
Any time the car is not on boost the gage should read 0.0

My sugestion is to purchace a 935 boost gage and pu tit in the left a/c
duct hole.  If you're careful, the process is reversable.  Just remove
the vanes (carefully), cut a 1/2 moon shape in the upper part of the
hole, and shove the gage in complete with rubber grommet.

This worked well for me and actually matched the rest of the gages quite
nicely.  You also get fairly good airflow around the gage since it is
smaller then the hole and circular rather than rectangular.

Should be vacuum (.4) at idle, 1.0 at full throttle < 2000rpm, 1.8 at 
full boost > 2500-3000 rpm.  A disabled cycling valve (broken valve or

Actually the indicated pressure will vary with barometric pressure.  
It's normal for the "engine off" reading to vary slightly +- from 1.0 
according to high/low air pressure systems in your area.  Kindof neat -

There are several. You can get the full list from the C.A.R.B.
None are cheap. I'd guess that you're looking at $5-7k, depending.
You have to buy the electronics, the injectors, the rails, the
misc. other fuel plumbing, the throttle bodies (that's where a lot
of the cost is) modify the pulley or flywheel for the ignition sender, 
buy the ignitors, do the heads for twin-plug, etc.

And, unless you've done this before and have access to a dyno, I'd
really advise you to have it installed for you. Tuning and programming
is easy, getting it right is hard.

Electromotive TEC II, CompTech, and HalTech can all do this.
Some caveats:

* TEC II is fine as long as you run it in a common plenum mode. It
  integrates EFI and ignition into a common system. In use for the
  ZZ/ProTechnik Racing IMSA GTU 911, we had all manner of problems
  getting it to work right in a high-butterfly configuration (Kevin
  Gross can also comment on this...) In fact, Sam said he'd sell the
  whole setup "cheap to anyone that wants it -- *REAL* cheap to someone
  that wants it that I don't like".

* HalTech is stupid, as in processing impaired. It doesn't do much of
  anything useful for a street car, but is OK for racing applications.
  There is rumored to be a "next generation" unit forthcoming, but
  I haven't gotten my evaluation unit yet.

  Oh, HalTech also doesn't do ignition. Use the Electromotive crankfire
  kit with any of the HalTech stuff. The Electromovite ignition is
  bulletproof.

* CompTech is the current hot setup, but they don't sell kits. You
  have to get it "done". Which involves sending your car to one of

With the ignition on and engine off the guage is a little over 0.4 
(almost at 0%). Starting the engine, no change. Full boost is a little
over 1.0. I haven't noticed any problems running except maybe a
slight miss ( I need new plugs bad, i hope thats all) and just
this morning she didn't want to run until I gave a little gas in my
driveway. And the idle wasn't smooth like it should be. Is there a

Richard writes:

*****************************************************

My trusty (Well, consistent!) '70 911T has is burning oil.  Not so that
it's visible all the time, but it smoke pretty bad when you first start
it, and it leaves little spots of oil wherever it goes, like a puppy
that needs to be house trained.

The second part of my problem is I'm looking at the Chevy 350 conversion
kits.  How reliable are they?  I've got Better Bodies' '93 Turbo kit on
my car, which makes it LOOK fast.  I want it to go fast.

******************************************************

The oil problem sounds like oil's leaking onto the heat exchangers.
Probably from the "breather area," the oil return tubes, or valve 
covers.  

The "breather area" is allllll the way forward (in front of my fuel 
injection stuff [911sc]) in more or less the center is the oil light 
sender (and (i think) a BREATHER tube ).  Make that all the way 
forward on the top of the engine.

Either or both may leak.  My oil light sender went a few years ago.
It took a couple of hours ($10 part) to fix.

The only reason it doesn't take 20 minutes to fix, is that I had to 
lower the engine to reach the sucker.  If you have long thin arms
with 2 elbows (each) it should be easy.

The oil return tubes are under the cylinders, two on each side, and
go from under the valve cover to the crankcase.

I assume you know where the valve covers are.


Regarding the chevy 350, I actually saw one of these recently (Fry's 
in Palo Alto).  Had to go back to work, so didn't talk to the owner.

Peeked through the grill in the tail and said "hey, Elderbrok makes an
intercooler?"  He had a chevy emblem on the hood where the crest 
normally goes.  Kinda cute.

The main drawback I'd see (aside from the heresy trial and subsequent
BURNING AT THE STAKE) is that the 350 is probably just a wee bit
heavier than the original engine.  I'd guess that you will need 
much stiffer torsion bars, the stiffest shocks you can find, and 
a mondo front sway bar.

Expect to pay a handling penalty.  I think you'd be a lot better
off just buying an '86 or newer corvette.  It already has a 350
and will handle a lot better the "chorsche"  ("pevy?").

I'd consider looking for a used 3.0 or 3.2 instead.  It will bolt 
in and you will still be able to go around corners.  I've seen 
3.0's as low as $3k in Pano (70k miles).

I passed this on to my friend Joe Wilkinson, who owns an '89 turbo S and
recently went thru a diagnosis on his.  Joe wrote me back:

 -This sounds similar to the problem I had with my car, however mine would
 -boost to 1.3 BARs. The computer limits the boost to 1.3 and retards the
 -timing when it senses a problem, sort of a limp home mode. Buried in the
 -workshop manual somewhere is a procedure to isolate the computer from the
 -mechanical side of the turbo by crimping the rubber hose connecting the
 -waste gate (aka a control valve) to a switch located under the intake
 -manifold between 1st and 2nd cylinder. If boost returns to normal with this
 -hose crimped it is either the switch, as was my case, or one of the
 -computers. If boost remains low it is either a waste gate, turbo or maybe as
 -simple as an exaust leak.

 -When the key is on and the engine off the gauge should read 1 BAR.  This is
 -the gauge self check mode.  .4 BAR at idle is about right.

Hope this helps...

we are in confusion of psig vs psia (or bar absolute vs bar gage).  Off
hand I recall the 951 reading in gage pressure (abopve absolute which is
how most people think of it).  The 935 gages read in bar absolute, hence
1.0 bar on a 935 abs is the same pressure as 0.0 on a 951 gage.  tHE 951
range is 0.0 -> 1.0 boost or gage.  The 935 gage is marked 1.0 -> 3.0
absolute, or 0.0 -> 2.0 gage or boost pressure.

One measures boost, the other absolute pressure.  Whn you put 14.6 psi
in a tire, that is one bar gage, 2 bars absolute.

When I put the 935 gage in my 951, some of my students were agast at my
2.0 bar pressure reading.

The other problem with a 951 gage is that you cannot tell when you're in
an overboost situation.

I call it a nine fourty four.  Some may call it a nine-eleven, which is
phoneteically shorter than nine one one due to the pauses between the

Ok, so I'm as full of sh*t as the next guy, but say nine-eleven 10 times
and nine-one-one ten times and take times.  You'll find it faster to say
9-11.  If you try 9-4-4 vs 9-40-4 you'll find very close times.

Subject: 83 SC - running hot?

My 1983 SC seems to me to run hot, although this may be normal for
this car. On the stock temperature guage the needle is firmly planted
at the top white mark once the car warms up. I put in a Terbatrol
front oil cooler at one time that did not seem to have any effect. It
has since broken and been replaced by the stock trombone.

I live in northern CA where typical daily temperatures rarely exceed
90 degrees. My old 70 911T always ran around 180, even after an
'almost an S' rebuild, and no front oil cooler. I have the guage and
sender with temperature calibrations, but have not yet installed it.
Am I safe in assuming this thing is properly calibrated and all I
have to do is pop it in? (Well, not quite 'pop' it in, or I would
have already installed it). If the car is running hot, what are
possible problems I can look for? 

Remember this car is in Calif, where removal or modification of smog
equipment is virtually impossible.

While I'm on this car, the passenger side remote mirror operates in
the vertical but not horizontal plane. The driver side works
correctly. Is this an easy fix, and what needs to be fixed, or do
parts need to be replaced?

Make that 2500-3500 rpm.  Above 3500 rpm should be 1.5 bar.  The quick test
is to clamp the hose that goes from the cycling valve to the waste gate and 
go for a drive.  The cycling valve is under the intake manifold around cyl.
4.  You can reach the hose between the back of the manifold and the firewall.
Its about the thickness of your finger.  I used a small pair of vise grips to
clamp mine but be carefull not to tear or break the hose.  With the hose clamped,
the boost meter should peg at 2 bar.  The computer will shut the engine down
if this boost level is maintained for about 3 seconds.  Don't blow your engine.
If you're getting boost, you will feel it even if the guage doesn't show it.

Subject: Re: 83 SC - running hot?

     My '83 SC (trombone cooler) temperature runs about a needle
width above the LOWER white mark.  It fluctuates about a needle
width depending on ambient variation (from 50F to 90F).  Above
90F, at slow speed with the A/C (which I use about twice a year),
or serious climbing, or autocrossing, it will get up to the upper
white mark, or a tad above.  At this point i start worrying about
cooling it off.

     BTW, did you know that your stock gauge DOES have calibrated
markings?  They are in degrees C, small, and hidden by the bezel
to the left of the marks you are talking about.  You need a
flashlight to peek in at an angle to read the numbers.   I
believe the upper white mark is labeled 120 C, which would be
about 248 F.

     Anyway, it sounds like yours is running hot (that's what you
said, isn't it).  There is a thermostat which controls
circulation to the front cooler.  If it is not opening, the front
cooler would be cool to the touch.

Subject: boost guage

> From timmins:
  "we are in confusion of psig vs psia (or bar absolute vs bar gage).  Off
   hand I recall the 951 reading in gage pressure"

  The 951's gauge reads absolute pressure, in fact the whole system is
supposed to "ignore" the ambient air pressure and provide full HP/boost
through greater than 5280ft altitude.  As mentioned the guage should
read 1.0 +/- a *Very* small percentage depending upon weather&altitude
etc...
  The min "boost" as indicated should be pegged below 0.4 on the guage,
i.e.  mostly vacuum.
  The max "boost" as indicated should peg 1.75 bar.  ~1.002bar = 1
atmosphere.  The max boost is mapped against RPM and there's a wonderful
chart buried in the original 951 article in Panorama/Fixin-up that shows
how they increase boost and then taper off boost after some RPM (5300?).
I presume that it's through remapping this ROM that Autothority et. al.
achieve their HP increases.
  
  On Phil's problem:
  "With the ignition on and engine off the guage is a little over 0.4
(almost at 0%)."
 Since this should be pegged at 1.0, it sounds like the air pressure
sensor is kaput.  I STRONGLY recommend having this checked by an expert
since Phil could be overboosting his engine, which can lead to catalytic
meltdown :-( amongst other problems....

> Timmins also said:
  "The other problem with a 951 gage is that you cannot tell when you're in
  an overboost situation."

  I'm not sure I understand, if I see over 1.75 I know I'm overboosting.
I agree with previous comments that the gauge is impossible to accuratly
read, but being defensive, I rarely pay attention to it except on ride
"demos".  At least it's not the MPG gauge that the 944 got stuck with.

Sorry for forwarding complete note, but it's fastest on the ol' IBM mainframe.
Replacing sender is a 20 minute job.  Do it NOW (to preserve your sanity, if
not a near bulletproof 3.0 liter).  Temp sender is to right of fan as you face
the rear of the motor, one wire to disconnect, unscrew old, screw in new.
Gauge comes out the front of the dash (large flathead in from the side may be
needed).  takes 10 minutes to disassemble/reassemble gauge w/ new face piece.

if eng. still runs hot check 1st: internal thermostat -- towards front top of
motor under somewhat oval cover.  heat it up in a pan of water or oil (cooking)
on the stove (if you have a thermometer, use oil) should open FULLY by 200 deg
or water boiling.

2nd have engine oil cooler checked -- I've seen partially clogged ones that
aren't obvious to detect....

Subject: 86 911 A/C problem

Hi,
	Comments/ideas appreciated.

I have a 86 911 cab, factory air which i never used for 1 year or so.
Air blew ok, but not really cold when i started using last week.
 - visted my local buddy at a garage
 - view glass inside fender showed little ball at bottom of view glass
 - 4 cans freon, low side psi 35 lbs, high side 95-100 lbs
 - ball at top of view glass
 - no leaks on sys.
 - full blast air still not really cold

q1. - he suggested I had a stuck evaporator valve ?
	- how do I find it and is it testable ?

q2. - should the high side be more like 150 lbs ?
	- if so - what might the pronlem be, ?

q3. - With A/C on I have the idle problem that was discussed before
	but it was only a point setting problem. Is there and adjustment
	for an 86 that will alleviate the A/C affecting the idle.\

comments appreciated !

regardsm
Tom

I came across a BEAT BEAT 1980 coupe that is perfect for restoration. Outside
is straight but paint is all crazed and cracked (black). Inside is an ugly
blue which is all torn, seats, dash tattered etc. Mileage is 154,000.

Q. - 154k - is high, is it better to exchage an engine or to rebuild one
	and at this  mileage I assume it's going to be top and bottom

	Who is good for rebuild/exchages.


The guy wants about 9k for it - it seems to runs real smooth as is. My goal
is to put it up on blocks, strip, wide-body c2 it and chop the coupe to
a cab top ( using factory parts for the top )

	I'd rather pay 6-7k for it. Any recent buy/sells numbers that might be
similiar would be helpful.

In fact Joe told me that the Porsche engineers had taken the car to a local

I had this problem also and it turned out to be coming from the
small hole in the air box (dripping onto the heat exchangers).  Easy fix.
Just find a same diameter tube as the hole and divert the path.  My mechanic 
said that this problem occurs when there is a bit too much oil in the engine.
The funny thing was that it would happen when the passenger side of the car
was higher than the driver side and therefore the accumulated oil in the air
box would travel to the hole and drip.

One of the projects I've played with over the years was Jack Hagemann's 
911 spyder.

Jack built track cars as a living for many years, he got the idea that 
he wanted an RS-60, but the prices scared him off (like all the rest of 
us). So he built one of his own. Tube frame and aluminum body built in 
his shop. 110% original size and still too small for me. Excepting the body, frame and one other part, everything is Porsche.

Jack will be at the historics in a few weeks, you can't miss the car.
Say `Hi' to him. He won't be included in the 911 festivities, but he
has more than the usual spirit.

The car is Guards Red and very visible, it has fuchs wheels and shines.

*bbbrzzrrtttt!!!* Wrong answer, thanks for playing.

Engine life on the 3.0 and up engines is over 250K with good maintenence
and changing over to pressure fed tensioners at some point. My 911 has just
over 140K miles and still runs strong. Wins regularly in autox events in
stock 911 class, even.

Don't do the engine until the engine tells you to do the engine.

>The guy wants about 9k for it - it seems to runs real smooth as is. My goal
>is to put it up on blocks, strip, wide-body c2 it and chop the coupe to

Price sounds OK. Ratted 911SCs are 8.5-10.5K around here. Doing the wide 
body, C2, etc stuff is OK, but you won't see any of that money back when
you sell the car. And you *CAN'T* put a cab top on a coupe unless you want
it all to come apart at the seams the first time you hit an uneven patch
of road.

You *can* do a Targa (I even have a factory *electric* cab top I'd
sell you towards that project...). Very easy to do a Targa. Very,
very, very hard (and did I mention stupid?) to do a coupe.

>	I'd rather pay 6-7k for it. Any recent buy/sells numbers that might be

Can't help you out there. The number sounds about right. But if the guy
is hungry enough, and you walk in with a briefcase full of 20's....

What is advertised is "Full-line Brochures" for $12.90.  This is the

In addition, he also has the various years' car-specific brochures.

    Well, my pronunciation mostly depends upon my mood.  On the water-pumpers,
It's pretty random whether I say three digits or one and two.  The air-cooled
ones
are generally one and two, e.g., "nine eleven".  The exception is the Nine Five
Nine.
(note the caps.)  It's impressive enough that it warrants having a lot
(relatively)
of time devoted to saying its name, as well as the emphasis on each digit.

FOR SALE: 1974 911 Engine and transmission.

My current project invloves this 1974 911 which I am upgrading to 
3.0 Carrera spec. I was thinking about keeping the original engine and
transmission but I have run out of space. Here are some details:

Engine: Original 1974 non-"S" spec CIS engine. 2.7 litre. Still in car
but will be removed this weekend. Running and leaking badly. Should be
considered as a candidate for a rebuild project, as mileage is unknown
but probably in upper 100's. Comes complete with injection and '74
exhaust and heat exchangers which are in good shape (not SSI). Dusty
and dirty but complete.

Transmission: Original SPORTOMATIC unit. Complete with linkages and
pedal assembly if needed. I don`t know the condition of the trans
because when I picked up the car I didn't drive it, so consider it a
rebuildable core. If you are building up a 914 track car this box has
some usable gear ratios you might need/want.

I am located on Long Island, NY.  I would like to sell the *pair* to
someone in the area who could pick it up, rather than try to ship it. If
you are interested please make me an offer, no reasonable refused.
Contact me via email for additional info, questions, and serial numbers.

actually a rubberized cloth which supposedly will stand up better.

Use the spray adhesive ( 3M HAS A GOOD ONE)

Trace out the old pieces. I didn't believe at first "I" needed to do that, but
it really helps. I used a heat gun in some spots to aid in the fit.

The kit has a ton of pieces - they also have seat leathers at 700/pair
rear seat 250/ door panels 300 pr in leather.

I hope you have alot of time and patience cause that's all it takes

I can hunt down their phone number if anyone needs it...

P.S - Tandy Leather has skins at about 75.00 - which I used to recover my

die leather or re-coat ,try the SEM color coat product - it works great on

Gentlemen,

Last night I was driving my `82 911SC rather hard on the local race track 
(free driving, no race). After having stayed in the pit for some 15 minutes 
I noticed (still in the pit, thank God) that I had no brakes (the liquid had
probably boiled due to the soak-back heat). My questions are:

1.	What type of brake pads are recommended which can cope with
hard driving (3 - 5 times per year) and "normal" driving on public roads

Subject: cool down in 951

Some rules worth following in a 951 (or just about any turbo)

 - don't drive the car hard just before stopping. i.e. minimal boost
   for the last few minutes.

 - let the car idle for a few minutes after stopping before shutting it
   off. some people even fit turbo coolers for this, allowing you to
   walk away from your car and have it idle for a preset time and then
   shut off.

The 951 has a separate electric water pump to cool the turbo.  You can
occasionally hear it after shutting the car off when the water temp in
the turbo housing gets too high and the pump kicks in to move fresh
water through the turbo.  Overall, the 951 has a pretty robust turbo
setup but it'll still help to be nice to it and not abuse it.  The exact
thing you DON'T want to do is to drive the car real hard with a lot of
boost and then immediately stop and shut the engine off.  The engine
will be hotter than normal cause it's just been working and the turbo
will still be spinning, perhaps as fast as 100,000 rpm.  The oil and
water pumps will no longer be circulating fresh cooler liquids, so the
turbo won't get fresh oil and all the heat in the engine will have no
place to go except to the surrounding air.

The 951 seems to run quite warm and retains a lot of heat energy in the
engine compartment.  Ever open the hood after a hour or two?  It's still
pretty damn hot in there!

Subject: 944 Turbo cool down

Felix,
 Thanks for the excellent comments on cooling these cars down. On our 1986
944 Turbo the electric pump always runs for at least 25 seconds after
shutdown. It is thermostatically controlled so that it will run longer
if it needs to. Generally though, even on the hottest Houston summer
days, if I follow your advice on cooling the car down the pump runs for
the minimum time.
 I was also relieved that at least one part of the car is considered
robust! All of the traffic on what breaks on 944's was beginning to give
me the urge to drive slowly. The urge goes away when I bring the boost up...

Jeff,

	You might consider Cobra seats, if you're on a budget.  They are also
priced well below RECARO's.  Another approach is to call RECARO, USA, the
importer.  I think they are in MN?  They run clearance specials occasionally.
I got mine that way and saved about 35%.

	As for street/track, it depends on what model you are considering.
Lightweight full race seats are NOT suitable for long trips (2+ hours),
no matter who makes them.  Sport seats or street seats are streetable, but
they add weight, etc.

	I have RECARO C-classic's in my street Porsche, and COBRA Kevlar
Sebring's in my race Porsche.  Both are the best you can get for their
intended purposes, but neither are great for the other's purpose.

	If you have a multi-purpose car, you will have to compromise.
My recommendation is the RECARO SRD.  It's more than the $200 Corbeau,
but you won't dread the drive to work at the end of the week.  Nor will
you drag down the value of your car.  RECARO makes mounting brackets 
for all Porsches.  I don't know about Corbeau.

Before I discovered "cool carbons" I used Ferodo DS-11s.  The were marginal
for the street, but worked well for the track, once heated up. I have to admit,
I haven't given the new pads a strenuous work out on the track, but have had
good reports from people I trust.  They work fine for the street (minor warm
up helps, but not bad even when cold).

For Dot 3/4 compatible fluid, I've had the best luck with Motul 300deg C
fluid -- sorry Castrol LMA fans, I find no comparison between the two when
the going gets "hot".

Stay away from the stainless lines unless your application is pure race.
Any pedal firmness gained is offset with their short life, I've seen several
stainless lines that have failed for no apparent reason (other than they
were driven daily).  I think they may not be flexible enough for extended
suspension travel and actually fatigue by too much flexing (IMO)...

Gentlemen,

Last night I was driving my `82 911SC rather hard on the local race track
(free driving, no race). After having stayed in the pit for some 15 minutes
I noticed (still in the pit, thank God) that I had no brakes (the liquid had
probably boiled due to the soak-back heat). My questions are:

1.      What type of brake pads are recommended which can cope with
hard driving (3 - 5 times per year) and "normal" driving on public roads
(Mintex, Ferodo, Repco, Jurid etc)?

2.      What type of "high temp" brake fluid is recommended?

3.      Is it worth the money to change to stainless steel brake hoses i.e.
will there be any noticable change in the brake feel? Are there any
drawbacks with these?

Jeff Bailey asked about Corbeau vs. Recaro racing seats...

I have a Corbeau GT racing seat in my VW Golf race car.  It is comfortable
with very good side bolster support at the hips.  Your hips don't move.
The longest I have been in it at one stretch was 2 hours 20 minutes during
an enduro race.  The padding at the top of the left side bolster has become
compressed (I don't know how old the seat is) and at the end of the enduro
(on a right hand turn course) I had a red mark on my skin which went away
by the end of the day.

I have not sat in a Recaro racing seat.  The factory Recaro's in my 81 911
are very comfortable, even on long 8 hour drives.  They have almost no side
support so are not good for the track.

A local guy who is getting back into racing, in a mid 70's 911, was going
around sitting in all the race cars testing the seats.  He ended up getting
the seat I have because he liked how comfortable it is.  He drives his car
to the track and then races it.

That's all well and good, but unless you can fit corvette wheels all
around, the only track tires right now are the Toyos, which are JUNK.
These were spec'd for carrera cup and are generally concidered greasy.

Seems to me the big boys around us are doing just fine withthe turboS
brakes (928s4) .  It's a bolt on swap and it works.  Lots of people can
convince you you need to spend $$$, but first look at moving whe CG
rearward and putting some bias ADJ in to get the rears up to their
capacity.

Right now the car is to forward, brakewise.

Loosing the 10% weight would prob be better than adding 10% more
surface area (or whatever) and will help cornering to boot.

......But that's just my opinion.

I have been using Repco MetalMasters on my 81 911SC.  They are good on
the track but not good for emergency stops on the street when the pads
are cold.
 
One of the best things you can do is get brake ducting hooked up.  This
will direct air at the brakes and help them run cooler.  This is an
absolute must in a race car.

I just forced myself to not use the brakes as hard on the track.  I don't
try for maximum performance braking all the time.  My brake fluid still
boils but the pedal stiffens up once the brakes get warm again.  When
the brakes are cold on the drive home there is not much stopping power.

Nope. The rest of the car is pretty much the same from '77 to '78.

>q-2 how difficult is it to swap to a 3.0, is it just plug,bolt and play ?

It is. You don't need to change anything else, but you do need to make
sure you have 3.0 sheet metal around the engine. If you keep the CIS,
there are some *MINOR* plumbing differences, mainly length of lines. 
Nothing major, nothing worth worrying about.

"hard" swaps involve things that never mated at the factory, like 3.2 cases
onto 901 transmissions, or G-50 transmissions in to '71 Ts, or Tiptronic
transmissions into '82 SCs -- silly things like that.

>q-3 does a cooked 2.7L worth anything ?

Depends. There is *always* a market for good used heads, P & C, rods, crank,
etc. The case may or may not be worth anything to someone (I don't ever
buy 2.7 cases, for instance, unless they're full of other parts I want).
It's going to be easier to sell the engine stripped and cleaned, so people
can see what you've got, rather than as a unit. Well, not easier,but you'll
make more money. As a 2.7 engine "core", it *may* be worth $1k (I'd pay
$0.50 a pound for it..). But, you can sell the rods for $500 a set, the 
crank for $500-750, depending, the heads for $150 each, etc. 

>q-4 transmission the same ?

Yup. The good old 915, from '72 to '87.

Subject: Re: Seats for your Porsche

If you want (IMO) the best seat for a Porsche that will be only  
driven on the track, I would recommend a Butlerbuilt aluminum seat.   
They custom-build the seat to your measurements, and it fits like a  
glove (I can't get into the seat with a bulky sweater on).  All the  
NASCAR boys use them.

They are probably too confining for street use (no experience), but  
are comfortable enough for several contiguous hours of use on the  
race track (some experience).  The added support makes a world of  
difference to your driving.

They start at about $250.  1-800-621-7328.

Subject: RE:  77 S vs. 78 SC

A couple of other important differences between '77 911 S and
'78 911 SC:

SC's had wider flares on rear fenders, so more room for big
wheel/tire combinations.

SC's went back to aluminum alloy calipers on front brakes:
less weight but more flex.

Some '77's may still have the magnesium case 915 transmissions,
again less weight, but less strength.  My '76 mag trans case
was cracked in multiple locations, so it's a significant
difference.

Auto-heat was rare in 77 S's, but standard for 911 SC's.  This
is an improvement, or a setback, depending on your point of view.

Subject: Air Conditioning

        While driving home on a hot Florida afternoon in my '77 911,
wondering why even though the A/C was putting out cold air that my car
never got cool, I reached up under the dash and disconnected the hose
leading to the side "vent" and let it hang down slightly below the dash.  I
could not believe the difference!  The car immediately began to cool down. 
I did the same with the passenger side vent and now I have to lower the
output to keep the car from getting too cold. You cannot direct the
dirrection of the flow, but it does not matter.  You cannot see the hoses
unless you are below the dash.  
        Does onyone know of a way to replace those narrow slots of side
vents with something that will let adequate amounts of a/c air reach the
cockpit?  I have seen the undash system sold by PerformanceAir, but do not
like their looks.  But I plan to keep my hoses disconnected until I find
something.

I came across a nice white/black '78 924 w/ 140K miles but have no idea what

recently and the interior looks good except for the crack in the dash. All
original stuff (except I'm not sure of the A/C in the left-middle of the dash).

	- What are the weak spots to look for? Are they basically the same as

Subject: re: 911 SC Oil Temp

I have a '82 911SC and it also has the "unmarked" oil temperature gauge.
These gauges are only unmarked in that the temperature readings are
impossible to read while in a normal driving position. I've heard that Porsche
made the gauges this way because too many 911 owners were getting worried
about reading what they would consider high oil temperatures (ignorance is
bliss?!)

You can find the temperature readings for your gauge if you take a flashlight
and use it to look at the minute readings to the far left of each tick mark on
the gauge.  For my car, the top of the lower white band is 60C (140F), the
next tick mark is 90C (194F), the last tick mark is 120C (248F), and the red
zone is 150C (302F).  My car runs about 180F in the winter and between
220 and 248F in the summer.  It ran even hotter before I replaced the
trombone oil cooler in right front fender with a multitube Carrera
oil cooler (average temps dropped about 10F).  I still think this is too hot
and so do a lot of Porsche experts like Bruce Anderson.  For my engine, I
think the excess heat may be due to dirty or clogged cooling fins on the
cylinders and/or the engine-mounted oil cooler.  I just bought a 2000psi power
washer so I'm going to try cleaning these next.  I'll let you know if it works.

								- Davis

P.S. I also use a Synthetic oil (Mobil 1 5W30) for my car to prevent the
occasional high temperatures from breaking down the oil.  I still change the
oil every 3000 miles.  There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not the
low viscosity oil that I'm using is good or bad for my car during the summer.
Porsche does not recommend this.  I use it because:

1. During a Porsche tech session, some oil company "experts" claimed that
   low viscosity oils can be used year round and that lower weight oil will
   result in lower oil temperatures.
2. A chemist friend of mine also uses Mobil 1 5W30 in his 911SC.  He frequently
   analyses his oil to monitor the health of his engine.  He says that he
   could not detect any additional engine wear (i.e. traces of metal) due to
   the use of this oil over the summer months.
4. A lower weight oil will get to engine parts quicker during a cold startup.
5. A lower viscosity also provides better performance and better mileage.
6. For me, a 3000 mile oil change interval sometimes covers both hot and
   cold seasons.  What's worse: using a heavy oil during cold seasons or
   light oil during hot seasons?

G50 swap requires rear torsion tube change and springplates/torsion bars that
go with the new tube.  Also, the tunnel has a depression below the shifter (my
guess is to accommodate a longer throw that the G50 requires). BTW: I have all
the parts to do the swap, if someone is interested -- a package deal for sure
on the $$s...

Dunno about tip swap, but other than the weight, could make for an awesome AX
combo...

Aluminum case came out on the 915 box around '78.  Fine splines on the output
shafts around then too.  heavy dog teeth gears I think were later (Carrera?),
ring and pinion were 7:31 'til '75 or '76, then 8:31 -- if you're swapping
around tranny's this is important for SCCA Solo II rules (can't change the
insides).

I have never had any contact with the non franchise Porsche places,

there do seem to be a number of non-franchise places in London that 
offer a tempting but *VERY* overpriced array of late, high spec. Porsche,
Ferrari, 500SL etc. These guys appear to cater to the very wealthy
who like to browse prestige motor cars and pick up the odd one or two
for their collection. I would look at only Porsche specialists,
and would probably want an independent inspection of any hardware
I was condifering.

Talking of high priced, high spec Porsche, AFN at Reading have
an `92 Carrera RS, with a Porsche installed roll cage, halon, 
racing harness (driver and passenger), battery cut-out, non-cat
exhaust, custom Porsche chip, extra wide rear track, 7000 miles,
never tracked, Midnight Blue with black interior, Sex machine.

No way man, I may be crazy, but I'm not mad.

Subject: 914/911 master cylinders and spongy brakes

My '74 914 2.0L now has new rotors front and rear, new pads all around,
rebuilt rar calipers and new pedal bushings.  Whew!

Alas, after bleeding the brakes, the pedal still seems too spongy (yes, I
know that the 914 brakes are generally a little spongy anyway).  The thing
that worries me the most is that pumping the pedal will firm it up -- isn't
this an indication of a problem?

Could excessive clearance between the pads and discs cause this?  They
*seem* to be very close to that magical 0.2 mm (0.08"), but the handbrake
has no impact so I'm thinking that they really are too far off.

The only other possibility seems to be the master cylinder.  If a clearance
adjustment doesn't fix this, should I rebuild it?  Or should I pop for a
used 911 master cylinder?  (Anyone have one for sale?)

*Almost* ready to start driving now...

The engine has ~120k miles on it. How difficult is it replace these- that is,
remove and replace the studs in the case? Do I necessarily need to replace 
P&C, rings, cam parts? The engine runs fine now, and I don't think it's ever 
had major internal work done.

I replaced the exhaust with used stock pieces from a 1974 (dual inlet). Would 
a similar stainless system noticeably increase the power performance?

Finally, where does the wiring for the cold start enrichment heating element 
originate? My element is fine, there is no power on the + wire, just ground 
on the ground side. I expect it ties in at the engine fuse box, but am not sure.

Subject: 914 spongy brakes


Tom, 

Before you get excited and rip out your master cylinder, Jack the rear 
of your 914 up and bleed the proportioning valve on the firewall 
(lower). 

To bleed, have someone pump the master slowly three times, then crack 
the fitting going into the valve coming from the master, allowing it to bleed ( this is the line that comes from the center of the car). Be 
careful as this isn't a NORMAL procedure, fluid will go places.

After bleeding that end, then bleed the output side (the one that the 
lines to the rear calipers are fed from), again being careful about 
where the fluid goes.

The proportioning valve had a piston and spring inside, these can be 
adjusted, clockwise moves bias to the front, counter-clockwise moves 
bias to the rear.

The springs have been known to corrode and cause the spongy feel, as I 
don't know where to get one as a replacement, replace the whole unit if
you can't adjust it or bleed it. The Automotion unit (Kelsey-Hayes for
Chrysler or the Delco from GM work too) can be adapted to the location
and then adjusted per their instuctions.

I'm not a big fan of proportioning valves in the car, just another 
gadget to get in the way of driving, set it up once, then drive, put it 
someplace where no one wil play with it.

Subject: NEW 911 (PROJECT 993)


As a friend offered me a good price for my year-end 1991 525i (11,000 miles,
5-speed), I started looking at Carrera 2's.  I had a 1986 944 Turbo but tired
of it.  I've tried driving a couple of 1993 Carrera 2's and they took my breath
away -- they are what I would consider "real Porsches": the quality is obvious.

I have several questions:

1.  I've read some of the recent Porsche postings on CI$  and am alarmed by the
statements that one should expect to spend $2-3,000 annually for upkeep. This
alarms me both in terms of the money and also in terms of the time one we need.
 While I don't mind frequent oil changes, I just don't have the time to take my
car back and forth to the repair shop frequently as I often travel overseas;
also.  What sounds screwey to me is why should a new car as obviously well-made
as a 911 need a lot of fussing over and frequent repair?

2.  I see in the current issue of Road & Track that there is a new 1994 Carrera

My 84 Carrera with 120K miles on it requires less than $1k/yr to upkeep.  
So I'm not sure how that number was derived.  Japanese sports cars in 
general will sometimes require less maintenence but don't seem to live as long.
911's are a pain every 30k miles because you have to drop the engine to
adjust the valves.  For 94 however, the valves adjust automatically
hydraulically.

New models tend to make the older models depreciate.  If you were impressed
by the 93 Carrera's then the 94 will certainly nock your socks off.  
Considering the aluminum wish bone rear suspension and increased HP and
the new body style.  You should consider driving both first before committing 
to the $$.

Subject: 924 Turbo Carrera GT (GTS - GTR)


I have been reading a bit about the 924 Carrera GT (1980) and other extensions:
GTS and GTR.  These cars sound pretty impressive and I would like to know more
about them.

Apparently the GT was a limited production run of 406 - 190 in Germany, 75 RHD
to the UK and the remaining 135 in Europe - none to America.  The car generated
210bhp at 6000rpm.  Only 40 GTS's were built (245bhp) and 19 GTR'2 (375bhp).
								    ^^^^^^

>From what I can tell the only mechanical difference from the 924 Turbo to the
GT is the addition of an air-to-air intercooler.  Is this consistent with
adding 33bhp?  If so where do I get an intercooler........  Maybe it has a
different head, pistons, etc. to my '82 turbo.

I read some of this info in "Porsche 924 and 944" by Nigel Edwards, who happens
to own a Carrera GT, in a marvellous colour of grey!!!  The book has some nice
photos.  It has Fuch 7Jx16 wheels, but I think an awful custom interior (it is
all red - but is in keeping with the '79 Frankfurt motor show).

I would be interesteed to see what people think of the pros and cons of making
a replica out of a 924 turbo.  Are there body conversion kits available, cost
of intercooler, wheels, 911 sport seats, etc.....  What are the implications of
racing a conversion car, what class does it become, ditto for concours events.  There was a RSR replica at the racetrack the other day which attracted a lot of
attention, and it didn't do too bad on the track either.

My car will need a paint job (just happens to be grey) and a engine rebuild in
about a year or two and I am just fantasizing...

Cheers

Most of the early swaps are just bolt in and run, and basically you can swap
anything between a 2L to 3.2L BUT at what point do things get difficult? Eg is
a 3.6 mateable to a 915 transmission? If not, is a G50 compulsory. Are there
sheet metal (i.e. chassis changes) from the Carrera to C2/4 models?

Differing figures from different sources. There was a '72 C&D test
which gave

911S - 6.5 (?)
911E - 6.1 (?)
911T - 6.9 -> this is accurate, the other two approx perhaps. The reason, C&D 
thought, for the S's slower time was that it was more suited to faster speeds.A
quarter mile would have showed the difference. They also thought that the
T was the best due to it's lighter weight and better weight distribution and
better road manners (< 100mph).

> Also, what are the more common problems to watch for on a '72 or '73 911?

Rust - the base of the pan (sills, floor etc) is galvanized but wings, battery
boxes are not - I would suggest you use the front battery boxes as a 
rough guide to the condition of the car. Behind  the B-post is also
a common place for rust, as is the point where the front wings internally meet
the bulkhead in front of the door. BUY the book called "the Porsche 911, guide
to purchase and restoration" - very good book. Mechanically they're quite
good, 100K no problem (just run in :-), watch for worn synchromesh and an
badly defined gate - you have to take the box apart to fix this - easy to live
with though, although wives/ girlfrinds will refuse to drive it (positive 
advantage! :-). Trim parts are expensive as are things like lenses for sidelights
and indicators. IMO rust is THE thing to be concerned about.
> 
> Which year and model do you feel is the fastest and most reliable throughout

'73 - the later the model the better (2.7's excepted to some degree). Original
2.0L cars rising in value due to the 'classic" status. Early (powerful)cars
with the shorter wheelbase (<67?) have dodgier handling.


> Does the 2.4l suffer from the same overheating problems as the hot running 2.7?

No, no other Porsche does, it was due to a very lean running engine causing
overload of the metals used at that time - bad decision by Porsche! I think
this is well documented in Bruce Anderson's book on tuning Porcshes etc.

Water pumps are not the problem on a 924 that they are on the 944, and the
engine mounts, if bad, are not as $$ to replace.  924's tend to have lots of
little problems rather than a few large ones.  _If_ the car's been abused,
though, the cylinder head gets trashed first.

>        - Would 140K miles be of a great concern?

Yup.  (I'd say this for any car).  Unless the car's been _regularly_ maintained
since '78 (e.g. oil changes every 3-5k miles), the engine's going to need work.
At least get a compression check done, and take a good look into the oil filler
port with a flashlight and an inspection mirror -- you're looking for camshaft
wear and pitted lifters -- the camshaft oiling tube tends to get clogged over
time, and head wear follows.

>        - 924 v. 944 maintenance costs?

Fewer goodies on a 924 to break....  The 1 major bonus you get w/ a 924 is that
if the timing belt breaks, you don't trash your valves.

> The asking price is a negotiable $3500 ... what do you think?

Sounds a bit high, especially for a 78 w/this kind of mileage.  Porsche made
several improvements to the 924 in 80.  For 3500, you ought to hold out for
lower mileage/later year, or save a few more pennies and look for an early
944.  Don't even ask about 931's.

Subject: 79SC questions


   I have a '79 911 SC and some questions concerning it. Recently, I discovered 
   three of the left side head studs were broken in half (one per cylinder). 
   The engine has ~120k miles on it. How difficult is it replace these- that is,
   remove and replace the studs in the case? Do I necessarily need to replace 
   P&C, rings, cam parts? The engine runs fine now, and I don't think it's ever 
   had major internal work done.

You need not replace anything as a matter of course if you just want
to R&R a couple of broken head studs, but it requires at least partial
engine disassembly. This is a *fairly* common occurance on SC's, most
people are very suprised when they find out a few of theirs are
broken, because the car runs OK. But it should be fixed soon because
you can end up burning a valve or head or overheating a cylinder like
that.

   Finally, where does the wiring for the cold start enrichment heating element 
   originate? My element is fine, there is no power on the + wire, just ground 
   on the ground side. I expect it ties in at the engine fuse box, but am not sure.

There is no heating element on the cold start valve. Do you mean the
heating element on the warm-up regulator? In any case it all goes
through the fuse box and the engine harness, but a wiring diagram for
your model should detail this.

More or less, but remember the earliest long wheelbase cars, '69-'71,
are slightly different with respect to the upper mounting point for
the rear shock absorbers, which may require repositioning if you try
to put in a 915 into these cars. If you don't move the upper mounts
then you may have a problem with interference between the halfshafts
and the rear shocks. 

Does anybody have experience with this problem?

We've never been able to figure out how to get any 930 case (i.e. all 3.0
and up) to bolt up to a 901 transmission *and work*. There's probably some
custom flywheel/clutch hack which would solve all the problems, but so far,
no banana.  Plus, there's the weight issue -- all the late engines are enough
heavier that you would need to re-think the suspension, too.

While we've never tried a 3.6 (or any C2/4 engine, for that matter) bolting 
up to a 915, that *should* work, since 3.2s work with both 915s and G50s.
And as Scott pointed out yesterday, there are changes mainly having to 
do with the rear torsion bar housing and transmission mount points on the G50
cars.

Hmm. Not over here. A 2.7RS and an good C2 would be more like $110K
(more like 73K pounds). If the RS were a real lightweight, then add
a few more tens of thousands of $$$...

Oh, BTW, I agree with the assessment on the 2.4 cars -- *MY* dream car
is the '72 S, mainly because I like the forward oil tank with the external
filler door. Not because it's necessarily more convenient, but because
it only happens on the '72 model year (unless you count the '67 911R...)
But when you get realistic about it, the '72 have mostly become collectible
these days for that reason, making the '73 a better buy. And for "real"
driving, an E is probably better...

I don't know about the 72-73 911S, but my old '69 911S (which I believe to have
been bored out to 70-71 specs) would do 0-60 in just under 8.0.  I believe 8
seconds to be the expected value for the 70-71, so the 72-73 should be just
a smidgen faster than that.

> Also, what are the more common problems to watch for on a '72 or '73 911?

Of course, rust is always going to be a worry.  

The mechanical fuel injection has the property that if it works, don't touch it 
and if it doesn`t work, DON'T touch it.  Finding someone that can manipulate 
the mechanical injection is difficult and expensive.  I followed a flat spot 
(at about 3000 rpm) in '69 for a year or so until I ran out of money.  

If they didn't go back to the one battery system (when did they do that?), you 
can expect to go through a set a year (find an inexpensive -- read: non-Porsche 
source for the batteries).

Get a good engine, 'cause overhauling one costs in the neighborhood of $10,000
(and I checked all over).  Thank goodness I never had to do this.  Does anyone 
know why it costs this much (and DON'T SAY IT'S JUST BECAUSE IT'S A PORSCHE -- 
sorry, I actually had a mechanic say to me "You can afford it, you own a 
Porsche"; he never saw me again)?

Other than that, I only required tune-ups, oil changes, and tires in about 4
years of ownership.

> Which year and model do you feel is the fastest and most reliable throughout
> the 1965 to 1973 run?

Fastest without a doubt is the 72/early 73 (DON'T get the late 73 with the
ugly bumpers and the overheating engine -- you'll be sorry).  I may get slammed
for this, but here's what I remember. . .

	68-69 911S	2.0 litre	175 hp (?)
	70-71 911S	2.2 litre	185 hp (?)
	72-73 911S	2.4 litre (?)	195 hp (?)

> Does the 2.4l suffer from the same overheating problems as the hot running 2.7?

Nope!  Yippee!!!  

I'm investigating getting another 911 right now (hence, my membership in this
mailing list).  I figure a 911SC (because of the increased torque, higher
reliability, and guaranteed air conditioning) or a '72 911S (Gawd, those are
neat cars).  You can't go wrong with a clean '72.

'78 (first year of production) are worth staying away from, unless 
you're buying something for investment. in general, buy the newest one 
you can afford. porsche made continuous improvements along the way. 
some major highlights:

'80 changed to APC injection, from CIS
'83 (?) S model, with spoilers
'85 synchors updated to Borg-Warner style
'87 S4 model introduced

|2) which years contained major
| changes worth having and
see above.

| 3) which years are easier to service?

tee hee!!! none...  seriously, they are all quite complicated to work 
on, and they are very efficiently engineered (translation: "there's 
machinery packed into every available nook and cranny!").  some stuff 
to think about, though: if you break a cam belt on a 2v car, all you 
get is stranded, if you break one on a 4v car, you get stranded and a 
BIG bill to replace all dem valves. this means that cam belt 
replacement and tension takes on new importance on the 4v cars.

|  If all goes
| well I will soon be asking how to get more power, more handling, more 
comfort,
| etc. out of my immaculate 928.  Thanks

$, $, $$$. :-).  have you driven many of them? more comfort!?!  better 
handling?!? maybe more absolute roadholding... seriously: stay away 
from any car with extremely low mileage (hangar queen, all the rubber 
is brittle, and
the electrics are iffy), or with electrical problems, expecially in the 
central warning system and the lamp controller. there are enough 
perfect cars out there that you shouldn't have to settle for anything 
less, especially in this market :-) :-\.

also, if you haven't already done so, ask your local friendly insurance 
agent for a quote on your prospective pride and joy, it may be quite a shock.


good luck, and if your successful, welcome to the 928 owner's ranks. WE 
LOVE 'EM!

A lot of the differences depend on the year 924 turbo you start with...

I gave a lot of thought to this once also.  Even tested a few '81-'82 931s,

Subject: Porsche Parts Dealer Referral ?

Stan
        As you know sometimes it is necessary to belly up to the Porsche
dealer's parts counter for "dealer only items". I been able to get parts
sometimes at cost +20% which helps, but was wondering that maybe with the
size and growth of this conference, that it might make sense to have a
parts referral. If a dealer was approached with the pitch that we've got
500 + people involved in porsches, - would you be interested in being a U.S
wide supplier via telephone/credit card/UPS at a cost +10% basis ? (or something
along these lines...)

        It's just a thought, perhaps some people already get that low through
their own connections ( if so I'd be interested in which locations are more
willing..) Comments aprreciated !

IMHO, if you really love the 911 I think you should spend a little more 
for a 911.  I have always wanted a 928 but felt I could not afford the 
maintenance costs associated with owning one.  As a result, I purchased
a 911SC.  From what I understand, the 928 is generally superior in terms
of power and handling.  But again, the cost of owning one is SOOOOO 
expensive.  I think in the long run, your total investment in a 928 is 
going to exceed your total investment in a 911 due to the cost of 
maintenance.   Now days I still envy other 928 owners and wonder 
when I can afford one too.

In Aurora, OR (about 20 miles south of Portland, 2 miles south of my work),
there is a small model airplane company, called Proctor, being run out of the
living room of their house.  The owner and his son have a marvelous workshop
in the back filled with woodworking and metal working tools (they make exact
scale models of pre 1930's airplanes, museum quality).  Why do I mention
this?  Because Mark, the son also has a marvelous collection of rare porsches
sitting in the _other_ workshop on the property.  He has a 1973 911 RSR
lightweight (he had 2, but sold the rougher one about 5 years ago), this car
is one of 17 built for homolgation (sp?) rules.  He also has a couple of 
right hand drive prosches, a late 1950's 356 convertible (not a speedster I
think), and a 924 Carrera GTS!  I got a ride on some back roads in both the
lightweight and the GTS, (in fairness I did give him a ride in my 1966 911S)
WOW!  The GTS was incredibly light, nimble, and FAST! 

I guess there is something to be said for having more money than you know
what to do with.  He also had a couple of "boring" Porsches, a 1984 targa SC,
and a 914 of some flavor, getting up-fixin'ed, I think this was a 2.0, but I
was busy looking at other things at the time.

Subject: '68-73 911S purchase


   Get a good engine, 'cause overhauling one costs in the neighborhood of $10,000
   (and I checked all over).  Thank goodness I never had to do this.  Does anyone 
   know why it costs this much (and DON'T SAY IT'S JUST BECAUSE IT'S A PORSCHE -- 
   sorry, I actually had a mechanic say to me "You can afford it, you own a 
   Porsche"; he never saw me again)?

I think it costs so much because of the amount of labor and
specialization one needs to overhaul a 911 motor properly. Typically
at the shop I hang around in the chief engine builder takes the better
part of one work-week to disassemble, clean, check and re-check, and
assemble a 911 motor. So if you figure 50 man-hours at $50/hour,
that's $2500 in skilled labor alone. Then there's an average of $2500
retail in new parts and up to $1000 in sublet work (machining,
measurements, etc). Then if you add in $1000 for misc and sundry items
that might need replacement as you go along like an oil tank, external
oil lines and/or mounts, heat exchanger or two or a muffler and  you 
are up to $7000.  The $10K figure would be what I would expect a 
"performance rebuild" to cost.

 I know this is true for the 16valve 4 bangers (like my poor 944S, story
to follow), but when I had a belt let go on the 928S ('86 32V), the car
just ran very poorly.  Didn't need any new valves.  I recall that the
compression is not as high on the 8cylinder 928 as on the 944S (10.8 or
10.9 compression).

Subject: 924 Carrera

Kelvin,

Your idea of making a Carrera GT out of your 924 Turbo is a good one, 
there are a couple of details to be aware of.

The intercooler works with the later (1981-82) manifold, the round
single butterfly. 

The fuel distributor is different and the cars had 8.5:1 compression, 
that, with a more aggressive advance curve gave 210 HP with the inter-
cooler, 177 HP without. Norbert Singer indicated that these engines were
VERY reliable, he used one for his company car for a while at Porsche.

The suspension was basic sport suspension, for the street it was M471 
with the other wheels, 7 & 8 x 16. For the GTRs, the suspension 
delivered  on customer cars was almost identical to the Holbert Racing
D-production package offered in the early 80s. Holbert may still offer
all the GTS and GTR body panels with the Carrera GT panels they 
advertised  for many years. The Carrera GT retained the pop-up headlamps
but the GTS and GTR used some custom jobs that were $500 US each the 
last time I saw a set.

The owner of  a pair of GTS is Dave Morse at Morspeed in Campbell, Ca.
USA, he has the white prototype, I believe and a red one. I've tried to but the red one, but no luck so far.  

If you get to see a real one, you will be surprised at how stock the 
the car really is (a GTS). They drive neat, a fellow had one at the 
'82 Parade at Reno and he took second fastest time at Parade, he 
wasn't a driver, either.

The only caveat is that the all out parts for the GTS are expensive.

Subject: 944S Cam Belt Loses Teeth Again! (<14k)

Respected Porschephiles:

  My 1987 944S just lost many teeth on its cam belt (around the
crankshaft cam) AgAiN!  This time it was less than _14k_miles_ since
I had this particular ~$1900 job done and all three belts replaced!
(the first time was at ~22k, yes)

  Am I the only one afflicted with this short-interval cam belt breakage
problem?  The car is driven almost daily and never overreved or
jolt-started.  Albeit I sometimes drive distances at ~5000rpm in 5th, she's
always given a nice cool down before reaching my destination (no, she's
not a turbo but I love her that much anyway).

  A while back I recall some discussion on the part number for the cam
belt and the recommendation that there be a "-04" suffix (or something to
that extent).  Could using a lower "revision" cam belt have been the
problem?  Might some kind soul please reiterate this magic number so that
when I buy the parts this time, I can be sure its not a problem of
negligence or ignorance on my part?

  I recall that the last time I had to make this dreadful parts purchase,
I was given the option of sodium-filled valves.  It would seem to me that
perhaps this type valve (Na-filled) might deal with constant heat better
and not trash the stock pistons when/if the cam belt breaks.
Recommendations anyone?

  As my poor 944S sits forlornly with the head missing from her engine,
I seriously contemplate retiring her and putting the test to my 928S
instead.  Note: when a cam belt breaks on a 928S (32V), valves remain
intact!

  "4sale: 8-12 slightly bent 944S valves...  best offer."

        Lee Chen

p.s. I used to have an Autothority 2.5 chip in her, but sold it a while
     back.  Could this have been a large contributing factor?

True enough. These later-day mechanics aren't that swift on the older 
technologies (just watch one try to balance carbs sometime...) You should 
try to find someone who's been doing Porsche service since the early '70s, or
someone that has made the Bosch MFI their *life*. They're out there...

And, it's not that hard to do most of the work you'll need yourself if you 
are willing to invest in the right tools and the *FACTORY* manual set. Without
both, you're dead. Period.

>Get a good engine, 'cause overhauling one costs in the neighborhood of $10,000
>(and I checked all over).  Thank goodness I never had to do this.  Does anyone 
>know why it costs this much (and DON'T SAY IT'S JUST BECAUSE IT'S A PORSCHE -- 
>sorry, I actually had a mechanic say to me "You can afford it, you own a 
>Porsche"; he never saw me again)?

OK, let's try to answer that. Remember that time costs *AT LEAST* $45/hour.
I think "the book" says that R & R plus overhaul is somewhere between 45 and
70 hours, depending on the model. So that's between $2100-3200 just in 
*BASIC* labor. And if you want "special" stuff, like a racing valve job,
or all parts microbalanced, or other TRS, *THAT'S MORE*. And if you *NEED*
other stuff, like your wiring harness is shot and needs to be fixed (commoner
than you'd think) or you need all the fuel lines replaced, or you have a
cracked air box, *THAT MAY BE MORE*, depending on if it involves more
labor or just swapping parts while it's apart.

Now, parts. You *WILL* need: bearings, upper and lower gasket set, 
main seals, and "shop supplies" (case sealer, carb cleaner, misc goop).
Total on that will be about $1100. You *MAY* need rings, pistons and
cylinders, cam shafts, rocker arms, connecting rods, lay shafts,
case, heads, valve guides, etc. Cost on that varies a great deal.
Good used parts are often the best way to go; some shops sell you
good used parts at new prices. I know I've been screwed on that...

The *BIGGEST* rip-off on engine rebuilds is piston and cylinder sets.
Many, many, MANY shops just sell you new P & C sets, regardless. I used
to just pay to have them replaced, regardless. When I hooked up with my
current Main Wrench, first rebuild he took my pistons, cleaned them in
solvent, cleaned *THAT* off with carb cleaner and looked at them. Noting
no obvious wear, he then bead-blasted them. They looked *INDISTINGUISHABLE*
from new. Mic'd them, size was OK. Ditto on the cylinders. Net cost: $0, 
it *was part of the 45 hours in the book*. Most shops just toss them, saving 
the ~2 hours it takes to clean/inspect all 6 pistons, and then sell you 
*NEW*, making themselves between $1,000 and $2,000 on the set. Scumbags.

Bottom line: you *CAN* have a professional rebuild done for as low
as $3300, if you don't need anything major. And if you're dealing with
an honest, ethical, and competent shop.

Shameless plug: I can get you rebuilds on your long block for these kinds
of prices. We can also do any TRS that you've ever heard of, no kidding.
Basic prices: 911/930 about $1600 labor, 944/951 about $1800 labor, 
914 about $1000 labor, 356 about $900 labor.  If you're interested, let 
me know. Prices vary with the turn time you require (under one week is
a LOT more, as-you-get-to-it may be less).

I recently bought an '81 928 (three weeks ago) and my friend got his the 
next day (a '79).  So, please take this as coming from an amateur porsche 
owner.  Some of the things I looked at when deciding was of course price, 
then I called my insurance to see what the different years ran, then called 
the Dept. of Licensing to see what it was going to cost to license the 
thing.  After I got the dollar figures down then I went looking.  I decided 
that I wanted a '79-'81. (Mostly for looks, the '82 and up have the 'S' 
model rear spoiler that I didn't care for, and some also have side molding 
that I didn't want".  Also color was important to me, I decided it would be 
easier to change the interior color than the exterior.  As for driving and 
handeling, I think they all drive great (however, I haven't driven an 'S' 
model (Insurance jumps up when you get into the 'S' line).  Maintenance 
records are a good thing! just so you have an idea of what has been done and 
what you can expect to have done in the near future.  The final thing to 
think about is options (this is a list from memory, so there are most likely 
others, this is just for information). Power seats, power mirrors, power 
door locks, power sunroof, heated mirrors, heated seats, factory alarm, (all 
the ones I've seen so far also have  Rear window wiper, and rear window 
de-fog, so thats probably standard.)
Good luck on your search and let us know what you find!

Hmmm...  I participated in a photo shoot at a PCA race a couple weekends ago
(my buddy was there to photograph an RS America for European Car -- I got to
act as a gopher.  Too bad that the guy blew his engine after a couple of laps.
But!  I digress. . .).  Most of the hotter custom jobs had the SC 3.0 engine
retrofitted with the mechanical injection from the '68-'73 911S series.  One
mechanic told me it was the fastest way to feed fuel to the car without going
to the full-blown racing injection.

This could well be true.  When I was chasing my flat spot, I was using a
mechanic that was less than reputable (If I can remember his name, I'll post
it -- ptuey -- so nobody from this group will use him).  What made me believe
that it was a goose chase is that my last mechanic (who was one of the Porsche
racing mechanics in 1969) confirmed -- don't touch the mechanical fuel 
injection.  

Likely, though, I just hadn't done enough research -- any recommendations?

Okay.  Kind-of scary, but okay.

How much of this is do-able by one's self?  I've rebuilt a couple of Ford
engines, but never anything like a Porsche.  The thought of destroying one
of these things by not getting tolerances right gives me the hard shakes.

Understood.  The prices I was quoted were just for the simple stuff.

Ah, here comes a divergence.  I think just about everyone replaced pistons.
That sounded pretty extravagent to me.  Pistons shouldn't wear out (now if you
go around bouncing valves against 'em. . .).

Yeah.  I absolutely *HATE* those 'you can afford it 'cause you have a porsche'
types.  It doesn't occur to them that I scrimp and save to drive one of those
wonderful cars and that I can't afford to pour money into them just to be able
to drive 'em.

No problem on the plug!  Where can you get rebuilds for this price?  This
could affect my decision to get an SC over the older S model (this is where my
love lies).  Give me all the info you can (you hear the sound of my breathing

Subject: 924 Carrera Fuel distributor


Pat,
 
That's correct, the 928 distributor housing with a special metering 
plate was used, sort of a dual plane fuel delivery system, the flow
curve was interesting.

The turbo housing was the main difference on the turbo, they used
a tighter drive side coupled to the larger impeller to improve the
compressor ratio on spool-up. The higher static compression smoothed
the transistion from normal to compressed aspiration. Two very small
turbos were considered for the GTS and GTR but the idea was discarded
for simplicity and heat. The GTRs had their turbo on the drivers side 
of the car, at least the one I saw, similar in placement to the 944
turbo.

The Carrera GT used The base stock 924 Turbo motor with the intercooler,
other wise the same mechanically. The GTS and GTR used (when new from 
the factory) a special intake manifold, the intercooler was in front of 
the radiator and the fuel distributor you referenced was used. There 
were many other small details, too many to go into here.

One, yes one, Yokohoma 17" A008  {255/40 ZR 17} is
waiting here for you to buy.  Plenty of tread.  This tire has
never been on the track.   This size may be destined to become
a collector's item....

I blew out the other one (ever driven over a broken muffler
clamp?) and I'm left with one.   I can't find another through
various dealers, wholesalers, etc..  Yoko apparently doesn't
make this size in A008's any more.   They make A008P
in this size which is the Porsche OEM tire and they make
the AVS series.   After having several dealers tell me "this size
A008 wasn't in stock but if you order it...", the factory service
rep on the Yoko dealer service line set me straight.   

fyi... The A008P doesn't have as much rubber on the road as
the A008.  Also, the A008 has a "wear rating" of 100 while
A008P is has a wear rating of 160.  {A lower number is stickier.}

So, if you run these tires and need one, let me know.

Normally I wouldn't have bothered this list with sales adds, but
thought that it could help out someone else who has a flat tire...

Alternatively, if you have one to sell let me know....

Dear friends,

I own a 1986 944 Turbo and would like to get more horsepower and minimize
cost.  I have heard of two possible solutions:  1)  swap the turbo with the 
bigger 1989 model, or 2) put a chip that increases engine output.

The second solution should be cheaper, and I wondered if you had any
suggestion for a good chip (something that would not make my engine

Doug,

Yes, I noticed the same problem when I upgraded my Weltmeisters to use
the so-called competition drop links.  (Double heim joints, eliminating
the hard rubber bushings which got chewed up.)

I started by relocating the pad-wear cable, tie-wrapping it out of the
way of the bar.  Then one of the cables developed a fault, causing my
dash lamp to always be on.  Since I haven't had the actual sensors
installled for years, I simply removed the cables, front and rear,
altogether, jumpering the front circuits at the plug under the hood,
the rears at the plug on the back of the rear seats.

Subject: Re: 924 Carrera

Regarding the 924 GTS, I can add a little information based on my
friendship with a local owner.  He has a guards red car with race history
when owned, I believe, by Bruce Levin (sp?).  Of the 50 924 GTS made,
it is one of five which the factory built for competition, and includes
a very beautiful aluminum roll cage, among other things.

He used to run the registry, but knows of the location of only four of
the other cars.  Two are owned by a gentleman in Connecticut, who
bought five from the factory and has since sold all but the two.  Those
two have ridiculously low mileage.

Derick Bell owns one, and there was an article on it called something like
"924 GTS - The car Derick Bell won't sell."  

It is a wonderful car by all accounts, except perhaps on the reliability
side.  There were so few produced, and fewer raced.  Dave and I would very
much like to get in touch with other owners to learn of their experiences.
The car has a lot of weird parts once you start digging.  The top end
of the engine is very different from that of a 931.  Its non-adjustable
cam followers are unobtainable.

Both tie rods end with left-hand-threaded M14 heim joints.  Very strange.
And as of last week, still available from Porsche.  For $200 per.  Ouch.

The front cross member is welded in place to the frame.  The engine comes
out and goes in from above, of course, but it is apparently very, very
difficult to do.

There is a lot of fibreglass in the body.  If you ever get to see one of
the cars, ask the owner whether you might open and close one of its doors.
They are so light, really artwork.  And it has these serpentine fibreglass
ducts cooling the brakes, amazing pieces.  To compare the fabrication
quality of the 924 GTS pieces, for example, to those on factory 962's,
it's just night and day.

I don't think I've told this story.  This car lost its head gasket at
the PCA Club Race at Bridgehampton last month.  It went on the qualifying
day, and we had a new one sent overnight to the track.  It showed up
around noon... but three of us got the thing replaced in 1 hour, 43
minutes in 100+ degree weather.  (One of our friends put a stop watch on
us, unknown to us!)  The car went from the back of the pack to win its
class.  Quite a thrill for us.

To repeat, if any of y'all out there know of other 924 GTS or GTR cars,
please drop me a line.  Thanks.

Lee -

Sorry to hear of your loss.  The original part on the car was
944.105.157.06, but was replaced by Porsche through a recall campaign
with part number 944.105.323.00.  The most recent version of the belt
known to me is 944.105.323.02, and it was created to be a much stronger
part for use in the 944S2.  This may not be the latest version; check
with your dealer.  I don't know whether the 968 uses this part.

After you had your belt last replaced, I hope you had it retensioned
after about 2,000 miles.  Absolutely necessary, as the belt stretches
during that interval.

Sodium-filled valves are used in the 944 Turbo, but have never to my
knowledge been used in a normally-aspirated 944.  The 944S valves
are in fact 928 parts: intake is 928.105.641.05, exhaust is 928.105.642.05.

My last try to forward my friends message failed
(sorry about that cryptic message). Here's however
another try:

When driving with my 944 (82) I get a high indication on the water temp
indicator. During warm up, the needle slowly rises to mid indication where 
it stops for a minute or two (the thermostat opens?) and then moves
on to a higher indication (close to next scale mark).

If I keep speed/load constant the needle will stop and give a steady 
reading. If I increase speed /load the needle will move to a hotter inication ad if I decrease speed/load it will move to a colder indication, but always
(at least during summer) hotter that thermostat opening and cooler or
equal to fan start.

I can't see water dissapearing from the system or water in the oil. I've
changed the thermostat (no difference).

What should I do next, water pump, radiator, head gasket...or?

Any input appreciated!

  I also own an '86 951.  It's still stock, so I haven't much to offer
except...
  I'd be surprised that adding a larger turbo by it's self would do
anything for you since the engine computer regulates the max boost by
measuring the air pressure into the engine.  It could help if you were
regularily driving through mountain passes but would slow it's response
time to sudden accelerations since the larger turbo would spool up
slower.
  I have heard that chipping is the first step towards increased HP and
is highly popular and relatively inexpensive.  I highly recommend you
call Autothority and ask for info on their chips and HP kits (upto
280+hp).  I don't have the number handy at the moment, sorry.

If any of you I have some errors I know I will hear about it, just be kind.

I have been looking at buying a Beck 550 Spyder kit and building it.  
Any experience out there with this kit?  

In the spec sheet they say you can use a Porsche engine (up to 2400 cc) which 
can be "a Porsche 356, 912, or original Porsche 4 cam motor", but you have to
use (?) a 4 speed VW transmission ('81-'88).  My questions are:

1)  What is the best engine to use?

2)  Where can you get this engine (what cars, shops, etc)?

3)  How much, $?

4)  Did the 912 have a 2.4l engine?

This car looks like a lot of fun!  I want to keep it as much a Porsche as
possible.  Any advice, etc. would be appreciated.

P.S.  What the heck is a VW type I?

Thanks in advance.

Conrad.

'
SUBJECT: '72 911 E & S comments

Sorry, I haven't had time to give input to the thread on early S etc. Here's
my $.02 on '72s:

First some info out of a test report from Car & Driver (Feb. '72). They
compared the T, E, & S models side by side for '72, so you might want to
hustle down to the library and get a copy (or I could be persuaded to make &
send one) Anyway, The E was the quickest of the three with a 0-60 sprint in 5.8
seconds (a couple of 5.0 mustangs have found out the hard way that my E lives
up to these numbers...), the S was slightly behind at 6 secs even, and I won't
bother you with the T. 1/4 mile times were 14.3 & 14.4 secs. for the E and S
respectively. Note that the S is faster after 100MPH and would be a better
choice for track use, the power really comes on around 5K rpm so it isn't your
around town stop & go model. Note: you can go up and down the production 911
line and not find many normally aspirated ones close to this performance...

Enough for C & D's results. I own a '72 with an E motor (started life as a T).
If competition rules aren't important, I know of some folks that are very
happy with 2.4l S motors with the pistons from the 2.2l (higher dome = more
compression = more torque and HP), sacrifice is octane requirements. I've been
very happy with the motor and the mechanical injection. I've owned a '71 with
MFI and had no probs either. I've found that with the short Bosch tune up
guide in hand (it is indispensable for MFI owners) you will never fear the
unit.  It is very tailorable for optimizing performance for your particular
use (street, track, AX, etc.) as well I might add...

Others (Stan at least) have commented on the '72's oil tank being in front of
the rear right wheel. Advantages and disadvantages to this: it does help
weight distribution and is more convenient (IMO). Porsche went away from it
(rumor) because too many dumb US owners and/or gas station attendants put fuel
in it (bet the car didn't run long after...). The disadvant's. are that it
holds a bit less oil and the lines take some weirder than normal paths to get
to/from the motor. I have heard that some folks have experienced main bearing
failures traced (purportedly) to less than full oil tanks under track
conditions. I have always kept mine full... Another prob is if you want to add
a front oil cooler to a non-S model (S' all came so equipped). The thermostat
for the cooler sits in the oil filter housing which is in the engine
compartment. The E & T filter housings are not machined to accept a
thermostat. No other standard thermostat and oil line combo from other 911s
will work. I solved this using the stock components (and a little engineering)
for a very clean and stone reliable cooler set-up, contact me if you need
info.

The 2.4l has (IMHO) the strongest rod attachment combo of any 911 due to being
the 1st ones with the large 10 mm bolts and not being HP stressed.  The 915
came out in '72 and has the shorter 7:31 ring and pinion.  I have the original
two batteries that were in the car when I got it ('89) and have suffered no
probs. like another poster reported.  I would not change the battery locations
as they are a significant advantage weight wise (you'd have to mount them in
front of and below the bumper to get any better...).

Oil leaks, like in all magnesium case 911s, can be a problem.  Mine doesn't
leak at the case but I've chased a few around the webbing that holds the
rocker shafts (race force RSR seals work GREAT here) and put the Carrera valve
covers on to solve leaks there.

I think the 2.4 is one of the more hardy configurations and should easily
last in the 150K+ mile range.

Other things:  Get a car with the S equipment group if you don't get the S.
It includes goodies like the big brakes (aluminum calipers might need replacing
- -- go to the cast A types) you're stuck with struts that will only accept M
calipers otherwise, the gauge package and front spoiler also are in this option
By all means avoid the Hydropneumatic touring suspension which was still an
option.  '73 is virtually the same car other than the oil tank....

That's all I can think of for now (and I bet you're glad for that!)....

Subject: RE: '68-73 911S purchase

From your response to wade@nb.rockwell.com you sound rather knowledgable about
rebuilding engines.  What peaked my interest was your statement regarding the
*FACTORY* manual set.. Without it you're dead!  Do you really feel that strongly
about getting the Shop Manual?  I have a '74 911S that I have to drop and
hopefully only reseal (what ever that entails).  As you may be able to tell,
this is my first porsche and my first attempt at dropping an engine.  I priced
the Shop Manual and it seems that it's a 2 volume edition covering the years '65
thru '83 and sells at a whopping $164 per volume.  This seemed rather steep,
especially since I only want the info on the '74.  Is it really that important
to get or are there any substitutes that could get my through this major crisis
in my life?

Also, is the a difference between the *FACTORY* manual and the Shop Manual?

Subject: Beck 550 spyder


   I have been looking at buying a Beck 550 Spyder kit and building it.  
   Any experience out there with this kit?  

They are very nice cars but they cost alot to finish nicely. Plan on
spending upwards of $15K on this project. The only one I've seen in
person was owned by a rich guy with bottomless pockets and he had a
*2.7* litre 914 engine in there. Beautiful silver with red interior.
Very authentic looking with all the right trim pieces.

   In the spec sheet they say you can use a Porsche engine (up to 2400 cc) which 
   can be "a Porsche 356, 912, or original Porsche 4 cam motor", but you have to
   use (?) a 4 speed VW transmission ('81-'88).  My questions are:

   1)  What is the best engine to use?

For economics use either a Type I (Beetle engine) or the 914 engine,
which is essentially identical to the 912 engine. All of these
powerplants will bolt up to the stock VW transmission which you will
use. Don't go crazy on the motor right away, stick with something
cheap at first and upgrade later. Actually, I'd just bolt in a stock
1600cc Beetle engine for starters and get the thing on the road. As I
saved some money then I'd start building a "killer" Porsche motor.
Given the weight of this kitcar, even the Beetle 1600cc dualport
engine from a '71 Superbeetle will make this a screamer.

   2)  Where can you get this engine (what cars, shops, etc)?
Build up an engine from a core which you can find at a salvage yard.
Pick up one of the VW mags and research parts suppliers if you are
building this motor yourself. There are literally scores of books on
do-it-yourself Type I engine building.

   3)  How much, $?
For a 1600cc stock, well under $1000 including the tools and engine
stand. And you get to learn alot to boot! You can also purchase a
built-up longblock from one of these VW engine discounters for $700.

   P.S.  What the heck is a VW type I?
A Beetle.

avery,

	according to the tech spec book (~$10 from your porsche dealer), the
79 928 put out:

	229hp, USA and japan		DIN70020
	240hp, RoW

	219hp, USA and japan		SAEJ245
	230hp, RoW

SAE horsepower is measured with more accessories in place, and i a 
better indicator of how the car really performs.  the real important 
and impressive number, especially for everyday driving is torque:

	245ft-lbs, USA and japan
	250ft-lbs, Row	

it was pretty impressive in 1979, but it aint exactly exotic car

I've seen quite a few RS Carrera's in Porsche Club GB's sales columns
for 25K, i've also seen a C2 for 20K, sum 45K - not bad if you've got it,
can't remember lightweight prices.

I like (my) '73 'T' because it was the last Porsche with carbs (euro modek
before anyone starts moaning :-) - less aggro than the mechanical CIS 
methinks - then again there aren't many people who *know* how to adjust the

Subject: 911 Sunroof Cable replacement

Pankaj is having trouble with his sunroof and requests help!

	Well, I just replaced my cables last weekend so the procedure
	is pretty fresh in my mind.

	The sunroof is operated by two push-pull (bowden type) cables
	driven by a common gear at the back of the roof, accesseable
	thru the zipper thoughtfully provided by the factory!

	It is fairly common for the cables to break at the sunroof
	attach point, where they are crimped to the shoe which cams
	the roof up at the end of the close cycle.

	First thing is get two new cables, as you might as well replace 
	both since it as a rather tedious job. Approx US$40.00 each.

	Next remove the inner closure panel from the sunroof by unsnapping
	the clips, approx 5 in number, by pulling down on the front edge
	of the panel. I use a modified beer can opener to slide in between
	the panel and the sunroof. When unclipped you can slide it back 
	revealing the under side of the sunroof and it's attachment points.

	8 bolts allow the roof to be removed thru the opening, sliding 
	forward and lifting up. There are two cantilever springs which
	you can swing towards the center of the car, to allow the roof 
	panel to come free. Pay attention to order of bolt, shim, placement.
	There is a cam/wedge under the aft most bolts, both sides, which
	reinforces and holds down the roof panel to the drive cable attach
	points. Remove the bolts, slide the plate towards the center of the 
	car to remove, pay attention to where it engages the roof.

	Now you remove the wind deflector assembly, 4 screws, actually 
	you could remove it sooner, as it may make roof removal easier!
	I did this trial and error!

	Remove the gear drive from the back of the roof assembly.

	Now you can slide the cable/cam-links out of the track. Note the 
	positions of the cable are different on the right and left side.

	You can pull the tracks out if you like and clean everything up,
	and relubricate the tracks. I used a solid stick lube in the track
	and white grease on the cables. Pay attention to the nylon/plastic
	pins at the back of the track, some times they stick in the roof,
	they should be attached to the track so you can realign and insert
	it back in the roof.
	
	There are plastic sliders on the cable/cam/shoe which should be 
	replaced, better get them at same time as the cables are purchased.
	clean it all up and lubricate it well.

	There are two different adjustments to be made after the roof
	is re-attached and operable. The Cam/link has serrated teeth between
	the two piece link. This allows adjustment of the closed position
	of the roof. Roof to be flush with car top. Loosen bolt, push roof
	up or down to suit and tighten the bolt, each side.

	The front up/down adjustment is a pair of threaded round nuts
	between the roof panel, and the front slider, around the outside
	of the weld nuts that the bolts go into. If the front needs 
	adjustment, remove the bolts and the slider and screw the "nuts"
	in the appropriate direction, reassemble and check fit etc.

	It's not a tough job, just tedious. All the parts are well made
	and the assembly goes back together easily. Check the adhesives
	that hold the headliner in the area of the opening, mine were
	loose so I spent several hours re-gluing the headliner to both
	the closure panel, and the roof. Get some good cement, I used
	weather strip cement (yelow Permantex # 80 I think). Lacquer
	thinner is good for cleaning up the old goo, as well as the new
	stuff that you'll smear all over your hands. 

	Good luck, and have fun, might as well save it for a day that
	you can set aside about 6 hours if you are going to do the headliner
	and all the other cleanup that we fanatics seem to be unable to resist.
	It's probably a two hour job if you just slap it together, but we know
	you can't resist to clean every little speck of soil out of that 
	unreachable crevice! :{>

I have a'73 2.4T Coupe - I have also driven an '80 204 PS SC model which
seemed significantly slower than my car. I'm pretty sure my car has had
a few minor mods to the cam and heads, exhaust (i.e. it gives about ~ 
150-160PS) and what with the lighter weight (compared to the SC) and the 
somewhat lower gearing (probably the most significant point!)  I suppose that's 
not too surprising - made me feel better anyway :-)

There are also Types III and IV, which use the pancake engine.

The 4-cam Carrera engine, of course.  :)  Realistically, a late 356 Super
engine would be pretty good.  Or, as an alternative, a well-built VW
motor (which could cost a lot less).

It all depends...

No.  The later 912E had a 2.0L, but that's a 914 engine, which won't fit
the 550 kit.

> P.S.  What the heck is a VW type I?

It's a Beetle (also Cabriolet, Karmann Ghia and 181/Thing).  Type I motors
are plentiful and can be easily built up to 2.2L (although durability may
be suspect at that point already).  The very first 356 motors were Porsche-
modified Type I engines.

Subject: Re: 928 opinions and setting the record straight

Well, having just sold my '79 and now selling my '83 while looking for
another one to purchase, and having done more to fatten the wallet of
my mechanic than I cared to, I find myself in a reliable position to
both comment on and dispute many of the previous comments.

> 1) which years should I avoid 

'78.  But don't worry, cuz there aren't many '78s at all

> 2) which years contained major changes worth having and 

The changes covered earlier are all true, but IMHO don't worry about
it.  The later year's upgrades are all reflected in higher selling
prices.  79-82s are so cheap that it's real easy to overlook the
better door locks (electric instead of vacuum) CIS injection, etc.  DO
look out for synchros, or at least have new synchros ($1500) built
into your offer.

> 3) which years are easier to service?  

None.  I disagree with the quality of engineering in a 928.  I think
the head designer should be beaten, flogged, shot, poisoned and then spend
eternity servicing these beasts!  As a product design engineer myself,
I believe that quality engineering doesn't end at the press tour---it
should last for decades.  Not only is Porsche's reliability far below
contemporary standards, but servicability is a joke!  It doesn't
appear that ANYONE ever asked how the 928, or any Porsche for that
matter would be serviced.  A prime example on the 928 is having to
dismantle everything between the radiator and engine block (including
removing the crankshaft belt pulley) to change a water pump.

> in general, buy the newest one 
> you can afford. porsche made continuous improvements along the way. 

Almost true.  When you consider the bargain you can get in 79s and
80s, versus how much incremental value you get by spending twice as
much, an earlier car (in good shape) is a much better value.
Also, if the past is any indicator, you'll really take it in the
shorts as your newer car depreciates.

Depends on how you judge.  The 928 is more of a GT car while the 911
is more true sports car.  Comfort is superb.  It doesn't handle like a
911 because it's a boat!  It's a big, heavy car, and handles like one.
It just so happens to hold the road far beyond more driver's limits.
The car can corner faster than I'm willing to, so for me its handling
is great.

Good luck finding the perfect car.  For whatever reason many owners
have let many little things slip, possibly because keeping one
flawless is a hobby, not like your Toyotas etc (see above comments on
reliability).  Perfect cars are out there, but very hard to find.
The comments on the electrical system are right on.  It's really a
pain!  The central warning system is overly sensitive, and many
switches and contacts are prone to intermittancy.

No necessarily so.  I've insured mine as "pleasure vehicles" in
addition to my daily driver (85 Supra) and the rate is about $600 a
year with a 7500 mile per year limit (State Farm).

Not true.  Granted, if you took it to the dealer every time somethng
went out, you'd go broke in a hurry!  But working on them is fairly
straightforward (but often quite time consuming.  See my earlier
thoughts on the engineering!) and can be done by the average
shade-tree mechanic.  Buy the manual: 8-volume set for > $250.
I buy my parts from places like DH Industries and 928 Inernational
which cut Porsche's price to ribbons.

Again I disagree.  More power, buy LOTS more weight!  So overall a
slower car (the power is great for pulling stumps!).  I don't think it
handles better or worse, just different.

Probably true.  But buying the parts cheap and doing lots of the work
yourself will help you with both cars, and make both of them
affordable.

You can right now.  Decent early 928s are far less than $10k.  You can
even get a "fixer-upper" for ~$2000 (gotta look hard!).

My cam belt went and that car still ran.  It had about 1 horsepower
(0-60 in 3-4 miles) and ran VERY hot, but I got it home safely!

Not so.  My 79 928 was about $600/year and the '83 928S about $650.
Considering it's a 4 year newer car I'm not surprised by the slight
increase.

Absolutely!  Look out for the following, 'cuz they're the most common

Most of the above are standard features except for grey market cars.
The American options are automatic, electric seats (standard on later
years), sunroof, alarm (which never works for long) and possibly

As I posted before, the 912E used the 914 motor, while the original 912 had
the 356 engine.  I'd be surprised if the Beck Spyder kit had motor mounts
that fit the 914 -- but anything can be fabricated...

I'll second this.  As I recall, VW engines went dual port in '69, so take
any one of those.  Even if you want more power, just bolt on a mild cam,
a big-bore kit, dual carbs and a new exhaust for enough power to make the
Beck Spyder fly...

When I replaced the belt in my 1987 944S about 1 1/2 years ago (I had
leaking balance shaft seals, and I decided to replace the belts to be safe,
even though they had <10K miles on them), I had several belt choices.
I started with an aftermarket supplier, who had the "correct" belt for
about $30. When it arrived, it was made by Uniroyal, and had, if I
recollect, the appropriate Porsche number, version .00 on it. I was
initially scared of the Uniroyal manufacture, since there was a Tech
bulletin insisting that no belts made by anyone other than Pirelli
should be put in the car. I couldn't tell if the Pirelli business was
based on technical superiority, or that no one else had cut Porsche AG
in on the deal. When I tried to explore the issue at the dealer, they
(of course) didn't know anything except that the latest belt had a
.02 version number, which was the latest listed in the parts fische,
and was made by Pirelli (oh yes, it was  about $160, rather than $30).
I agonized, but finally decided to buy the $130 insurance policy
against the pile of bent valves. Based on later discussion, especially
Kevin Gross' experience, I am glad I did, and would not recommend
than you use anything but the Porsche belt, obtained through the dealer
network. I don't know for sure that .02 is the latest version, but
the dealer would know. Did a dealer do your previous belt work which
failed? Do you have the failed belt, and does it say anything on it
(or does the water pump pulley rub all the markings off the back)?

Given your poor history, you may want to invest a few more dollars and
replace "everything the belt touches", including sprockets and idlers.
This is advice frequently heard even for non-catestrophic belt
replacements, and in that case I have wondered if it might be overkill
(I didn't replace all that stuff on mine), but in your case, with 2
failures under your belt (pun intended), it sounds like cheap insurance.

I don't remember if the car came with sodium valves stock, but I would
use the OEM part, and work on the belt not breaking, rather than finding
valves which will do less damage when the belt does break. I thought that
in general, the pistons survived anyway, but I don't know about the 16V
in particular. The advantage of the sodium valves might be that they
are hollow, and therefore weaker in bending. I don't see how the heat
tolerance would play a role.

I don't disagree. I provide engineering support for a car that has a Kinsler

We usually say around here that the worst thing you can give your 911 is a
home engine rebuild. You'd be amazed at some of the things I've seen come
out of cars that have been "totally overhauled" (or as one guy put it 
"RE-builded" -- emphasize the "RE" and draw the "E" sound out longer than
usual to get the sound right 8{P ) by Chevy/Ford performance types. One,
even, by a guy who at the time was employed turning bolts on AJ Foyt's
Indycars...

Not to discourage you -- you *CAN* learn to do this. I don't find it that
hard, but then, I started doing motorcycles, then VW Beetles, then air-cooled
aircraft engines (best experience relvant to this job) then full-race big-block
Fords. So I had a *LOT* of high-performance, tight-tolerance, aluminum, 
air-cooled engine experience *PLUS* race engine experience before turning the
first screw on a 911. For that matter, before turning the ignition switch
on a 911! I do know people who are self-taught that are very good. Some
on this list, even!

If you *REALLY* want to learn this stuff, though, look for Bruce Anderson's
classes (about a week each) advertised in Excellence. That's a good starting
point. Then make friends with your Porsche mechanic and see if he will let
you "help" him as part of your learning experience. You may have to pay
for the priveledge, or may not, depending. Remember, you're gonna cost him
money by not having so much work done by him when you're done -- he needs
to make that up somehow...

>Ah, here comes a divergence.  I think just about everyone replaced pistons.
>That sounded pretty extravagent to me.  Pistons shouldn't wear out (now if you

Nope. You usually only need to replace a piston if (a) a valve has hit it,
(b) there is serious scoring on the skirt (ask me about the Engine That Had
Been Sandblasted sometime...), (c) the ring lands are worn beyond tolerance,
or (d) you're working on a VW Type I, II, or III where a new P & C set is
cheaper than the time you'd spend screwing with the old ones.

So, answer this: who's going to know more about working on these cars than
the people who designed and built them? The price is very justifiable against
the huge volume of information in the sets. And unlike some makes, there isn't
enough major change from model year to model year to justify a whole new manual
set. If you're *REALLY* going to work on the car, get the FACTORY manual set.
If you just want a good reference, get the Haynes book. But don't use it
to take the engine apart, or do anything with the fuel or electrical systems...
Oh, you'll eventually want the Spec Book too -- has all the relevant specs
for measurements, tolerances, etc in one 3x5 pocket sized book.

>Also, is the a difference between the *FACTORY* manual and the Shop Manual?

"shop manual" == "workshop manual" == book with technical info on the car
plus some instruction on how to do the operations. "factory" == from
Porsche, not from Haynes or Clymer or AutoPlus or anyone else. You want
the workshop manual published by the factory. Period.

To make it look really nice, you need to spend a lot of time or a lot of

You *CAN* also use a 914 transmission, but have to do some surgery on the
cars to get the shifter to work, or use one of the cable shifter kits. That
also makes it possible to use 911 engines...

>1)  What is the best engine to use?

Depends. I'd say that for most applications, a "hot" Type I would
be best. Best performance to money ratio, mainly. In some dark corner
of the shop we have a 1776cc Type I (common size) that makes about 160 HP, at 
7000 RPM. Total cost on that guy, including the core we started with was about
$1k in parts, maybe double that in labor. (Elmer used to race dune buggies
and mini-stockers based on Bugs). 

>2)  Where can you get this engine (what cars, shops, etc)?

Well, your best bet is to find a local VW performance shop, get to know
their customers (particularly their *OLD* customers -- doing business
there more than 5 years) and if they check out OK, get one from them.
Or you can get one from me 8{), or as a last ditch thing, get a copy
of "Hot VWs" or "VW Trends", and see their advertiser section. Beware that
there are a lot of *VERY BAD* shops out there spending *LOTS* of money
to advertise, then sell you stuff that underperforms/explodes/never
works right in the first place, and won't stand behind it. As most of
the Bug-heads are basicly *kids*, even the 40+ year-olds, there is
this tendancy for them to go "Oh, cool -- let's get it" and *NOT*
learn from their mistakes, so the industry continues. And since things
are soooo cheap relative to the Porsche world, no single investment is
going to break you so you don't spend as much time doing the research
to make sure you don't get taken. Just my $0.02 here...

>3)  How much, $?

Depends, again. Bone-stock VW Type I longblocks from VWoA (well, 
from Bob Hoy, the El Paso dealer) are $549 exchange. These are
VW-Brazil rebuilds. And top-of-the-line 2100cc embarrass-your-friends-
with-930s from Jeff Linenger or Gene Berg will be like $10k or so.
(Jeff builds one engine for drag racing that we built an EFI setup
for that has a life expectancy of 10 *minutes*. But *MAN* it's fast
for that whole time...)

>4)  Did the 912 have a 2.4l engine?

No. Had a 1600cc 356SC engine with a few other changes. Don't use a
356 engine for this application *UNLESS* you need a Porsche engine
in it for competition purposes (i.e. you can't PCA Club Race it
unless it has a Porsche VIN, frame serial number, or engine serial
number, and I think the same applies in the PCRs for Parade autocross,
rally, etc.) A 356 engine will cost you a lot more, and not perform
as well as a Type I, certainly not for the money...

>This car looks like a lot of fun!  I want to keep it as much a Porsche as
>possible.  Any advice, etc. would be appreciated.

Hope the above helps. Ask Chuck Beck for references, so you can talk to
some satisfied customers. (I've never met one that wasn't) You might
also ask for "known bad" references -- people who tried to send the car
back, etc. If he gives them to you, you should talk to them to see what
they didn't like. It might be a problem for you as well. If he doesn't
give them to you, you should ask youself (and him!) why not..

The ENTIRE factory set of manuals for my '86 Mustang cost close to $200.
These manuals, like the Porsche manuals, are an absolute necessity if you
plan to do any complex work (i.e. more than new oil or plugs). On a similar
note many highly specialized (read expensive) tools are required to work on
the Mustang...remember this is not an exotic car, it is a rebodied Fairmont
with too much horsepower.
 My point (finally I get to it) is that many things that seem to be

Subject: VW motors etc for Beck 550 Spyder

Finally a question I can answer.  I've built several VW engines and am now
putting together my first 911 engine, which will go into an 81 Vanagon.  (My
77 Targa was worried, but I did not steal its engine for this project.)  I
second the comments about starting with a Type 1 VW.  Depending on shape of
engine cavity in Beck's kit, Type 3 (same guts, different aircooling design)
would probably work as well.  Type 4 engine, from VW 411,412,72-79bus is iffier.
In stock installations it gets supported at rear, unlike Type 1.  It is 
longer and lots heavier, so the decision about supporting it should not be made
...lightly.  Type 4 can be reliable up to 2.6liters, they say (2.0 was max
stock) and later years had hydraulic lifters.

Go with an 1835cc Type 1 engine.  Good parts are abundant and cheap, you don't
need $200 of tools that are used once per engine, and the manuals are written
in the order you do the work, unlike the expensive and asequential Porsche
books.

I have a set that I think is well worth the money. I often

The newer rev belts are improved, but that doesn't mean the old belts 
will snap at 20K miles!  Old belts should be OK when maintained / 
replaced often.  (this statement does not endorse using the old belts though!)

Sodium filled valves still need to be the same length as your normal 
ones, so they will not change the problem of hitting the pistons.  They 
do deal with heat better, by conducting into the head.  So, your head 
has to be strong and happy for this to work well.

You might have bad idler pullies or messed-up cam bearings.  These

I doubt it - engine power output doesn't snap engine belts - just

The latest Autothority chips (Stage II) are great!  I've had them for 
years (in older revs.) and enjoy them.  Takes the 217HP to around 
260-275 with stock smaller turbo.  Check magazines for their ad - 
they're in Fairfax, VA.

I wouldn't recommend the larger turbocharger - increased lag, more 
capacity than you need (i.e., you can blow the head gasket with the 
smaller turbo just fine!).

Subject: 901 Trans.


Scott,

Dwidget (D. Mitchell) uses a 2.7 mag case for his engine, should
be easy for him to do as those cases (without holes) are inexpensive 
and plentiful in Sacratomato. 

I used a steel plate in my 914/6 trans, seemed to work nicely even when 
slamming some hard autocross shifts. 

For those of you who aren't familiar with Zone 7 autocrossing, it used 
to be be very common to have to use third gear in a 911 or 914/6. These
were REAL autocrosses. Hard on clutches, too.

I did build a "916" trans for my 914/6, the parts are becoming available
again through people advertising in Pano. The second-thrid shift is 
hosed for autocrossing, but the trans is almost bullet-proof.
As I said before, the shifter mechanisim is a real bastard, 1970-72 
gear selector with a custom rod extension. Still, the damn thing works 
well with Big motors.

BTW, I think Honest Bill mated his 3.5 to a 901 trans. It seems to be 
holding up. He's using the earlier style clutch, there has to be 
something custom in there.

SUBJECT: '72 911 oil cooler installation

Got a note on the side that I responded to about the cooler installation,
since it was written anyway, thought I'd share it with the group:

On the oil cooler: I started the project by going to a dealer and having them
pull up the '72 schematics and shooting me a copy of the oil system dwg. for
the S (optional on the others).

The solution was to modify the original system to work like the factory
cooling system. It requires machining the thermostat/filter housing to accept
a standard thermostat (there's a cover plate where it goes, on the side facing
the front of the car). On the inside of the fender well you'll see where your
oil lines go to/from the backside of the filter housing. A plug is in the
outlet port that will go to your new cooler. I had a machine shop cut the back
of the plug off and weld a steel AN-12 male fitting on. I then ran an AN-12 90
deg fitting into AN-12 SS braided line to the front of the car using
fasteners, lines and fittings from Pegasus mail order racing supply. You
optionally could spend the rest of your adult life looking for the factory
lines in wrecking yards (and then giving them your 1st born male... er, you
get the picture...).

Back to our exciting story: if you use a factory fender cooler (SC is a
trombone loop of pipe (ok), early Carrera is 3 rows of 20 odd tubes (good),
later Carreras had radiator style (better), and late ('87+) Carreras used a
radiator style with a pusher thermostatically controlled fan (best -- for a
fender mount unit) you will need the Pegasus AN-12 to metric (30mm??)
fittings. Coming back you use the same type of line that terminates in a 45
deg fitting hooked to another AN/metric fitting that goes into the bottom of
your oil tank -- where the good ol' Dr. P. (his friends call him Ferdy) left
you another plug (how convenient...).

Instead of a fender cooler, I used a RSR style spoiler and mounted an early
Mazda RX-7 oil cooler behind it (did he say, ugh, MAZDA?) (yes he did).  This
is not that straight forward in that it requires some sheet metal work.  If
you're interested in this set-up I'll send you another note.

I bought an extra oil filter housing when I did mine to minimize the down time
on the car (and just in case they screwed up the 1st one)....

*PAID ADVERTISEMENT*PAID ADVERTISEMENT*PAID ADVERTISEMENT*PAID ADVERTISEMENT*

I have the extra filter housing, and a late Carrera fender radiator (with fan)
for sale if you're interested...

Ditto for pre-Carrera chain tensioners.  No thanks.  The .02 part was
significantly strengthened, and upgrading to it is highly recommended to
944S owners (all, um, how many? of us).  I "maintained" my .00 timing
belt well beyond spec, and it still busted on Long Island!

Btw, as Jim and Frank mentioned, I agree that you should definitely go
over all the parts which the belt touches, esp. sprockets.  One of them,
944.105.125.xx, was upgraded to 944.105.125.06 a few years back, and I
believe the new part is significant.  And cheap.

Dear Porschephiles,
	I have an '83 944 with 104k miles. Recently I have had
trouble getting the car to shift into second gear smoothly. Last
night it became very difficult to get the transmission OUT of
both second and reverse and a couple of times with the clutch fully
depressed the car would inch foreward and it was nearly impossible
to move the shift lever. This morning the 25 miles to work went fine
other than an occasional, slight "clunkeyness" to the shifter.
	My questions are:
	1) Is there anything realitively easy that I can check myself
or is an immediate trip to a professional mechanic called for?
	2) Can anyone recommend a good mechanic in the Chicago area,
preferably in the city or northern subarbs. I have been taking the
car to Lake Forrest Sports Cars but I have not been overwhelmed by the
service and the recent note on the net about them no longer being a
Porsche dealer but not telling anyone is a bit disturbing.
	3) Is this car reaching the end of it's life expectancy (I
am thinking about either an '89 944 turbo or an '87-'88 911). I would
like to use it for another year as my daily driver but the breakdowns
seem to be increasing in frequency lately.
	Words of wisdom on any of these subjects are greatly appreciated.
I can be reached directly at walvoord@chiefs.northbrook.aieg.mot.com or

Chris,

Sounds like either the clutch master cylinder or slave cylinder are
failing. Try not to drive the car excepting to the repair shop. Parts 
are about $200 for both cylinder from Automotion and the time is 1.5
hours to do the job, just to keep everyone honest. 

The clutch cannot disengage without full slave travel, if the cylinder 
is leaking or fails, you will not get full clutch disengagement. The
symptoms are as you've described. If you jam the gearbox, you will
destroy the synchros and damage the engaging dogs on the gears.

>If so where do I get an intercooler

	Porsche makes/made a intercooler conversion just for the 931. From
what I've been told it is a hot setup for the 931 in Europe. It fits in
the space right under the hood duct in front of the battery. AutoAlanta
also sells a conversion to fit a 944 intercooler in front of the radiator
(which I think means 5+ feet of plumbing to get it where it has to go and
the removal of the AC???). Cost for the factory intercooler is something
like $1500-$2000. If you are interested in a complete parts list, let me
know (I have it somewhere).
	If anyone knows of a good German junkyard that may have such a
conversion, let me know.

	Does anyone know what largest size tire can fit onto the 931 with
15" or 16" rims, besides the recommended 205-55-16. 215? 225?

It was initially a serious inquiry, since I felt that it will
reduce the damage to the interior of my car by reducing the

However, with the tone of your remark I think I will drop this Idea.

Certain dealers offer discounts as much as 20% on the manuals. Browse through 
Excellence and Pano. Frequently however, you need more than one set. For 
instance, if you have a 944 Turbo, factory manuals refer to procedures from the 
924 set, the 944 set and the 944 Turbo update. This unit costs about $500. On 
the other hand, a refurbished micro fiche reader (Panorama) is $179. The 2 sets 
from TMC Publications (410-367-4490) (924 and 944) are $70 and the turbo upgrade 
$25. Total : $274.00. If you happen to have a 911 or 928 also, the savings 
quickly add up. Hope this gives you another opinion.
	A question to all of you : I have the 84-89 Carrera manuals but half of 
the stuff is not even in there. How far back in time should I go to cover most 
subjects in previous manuals ?

Start with Brett Johnson's book "The Porsche 914 and 914/6: A Restorer's
Guide to Authenticity". Then, there's the "standard" Porsche references,
"Excellence was Expected" and "Porsche: Portrait of a Legend" which
cover the 914/6 from an evolutionary perspective. Cypress Books also has
a "service" manual on the 914 and 914/6, available from most of the
aftermarket Porsche suppliers, which is the only one I know of with both
the four and six covered in one place. Gold (or someone like that) has
a collection of all the various car mag articles on the 914 and 914/6
from when they were new, also from most of the aftermarket places.
And don't forget the various retrospectives done by European Car (back when
it was still VW & Porsche Magazine) and Panorama (some of which are reproduced
in the various "Up-Fixin' Der Porsche" volumes).

Finally, since you seem to be in Houston (or at least using one of the
Houston systems), you can pop by and visit with Joe Shemenski, the king
of the 914/6, over at Ghost Racing. He has 5 cars under restoration now
and one that's driven daily (more or less). Nothing like looking at them
up close and personal for more info.... (two are for sale, BTW, send me

Subject: 931 Intercooler


Rick,

The 931 intercooler is a bolt on for a 1981-82 924 Turbo EXCEPTING the
hood. The nicely done stock hood will have to be butchered to put the 
required air scoop on the hood to direct the airflow. This is the same
scoop seen on a 924 Carrera GT. The GTS and GTR use the front mounted
intercooler. the stock 924 Turbo scoop is for cooling the manifold and 
floorboard on the passenger's side of the car. Use a regular 924 hood 
for the conversion.

The intake manifold on the 1979-80 924 Turbos has a secondary butterfly
and will not fit the outlet of the intercooler, a later intake manifold
and butterfly must be used. 

I obtained the pieces for two people through RACE-FORCE in Emeryville, 
California, he obtained the parts from a broker in Germany, all new and
in factory containers. One of the cars i did was for a feelow in Fresno.
We got 218 HP with a stock motor, 8.5:1 compression the old ignition,
but with the late butterfly and manifold. I'd say the factory claims for
the Carrera GT are underestimated on that basis. 
Race-Force advertises in the Pano, I don't have the number handy. They 
specialized in the race parts and specialty things the factory offered 
but didn't sell here except to race teams.

205/55 16 on 7" rims on the front, 225/50 16 on 8" rims in the back, the
wheels were Gotti with a special back spacing, but cleared everything. I
use 6 x 16 on the front and 7 x 16 on the rear onf my 931 with 
unaltered  fenders or openings. These are stock 924 turbo/928 forged 
wheels, stock spacing, same size tires as above (Yoko A008RTU)

Authenticity"  The book is written by Dr. B. Johnson.  I just order this
book so I know it is available.  I had to special order it from the book
store at school and it only took about 2 1/2 weeks to get.  The ISBN #
is 0-929758-01-3. The book only cost $20.00 btw

It give you US, European specs. It gives you mid years changes and at
what chassis number the change occured when available.

Heres a sample:
Year 1970, Engine- 2.0, Displ- cc. 1991, Horsepower 110 @ 5800rpm
Stroke & Bore 66/80, Compr Ratio 8.6:1, Fuel system Weber

Year 1971, Exact Same as 1970 as far as above info..

Year 1972, Exact Same as 1970.

Total Production for 914/6 = 3,360

There is another option for the rear hatch on the 944.  At one
time, through the dealerships, Porsche was selling tinted Lexan
"inserts" that went on the inside of rear window.

This should serve to reduce sun damage in the 944, however, this
can no longer be bought through the dealers.

I've been checking, and there are a few of these Lexan inserts still
out around the country.  If anyone know where I can get one of these,
please contact me.

BTW, there are two versions: one for cars with a rear wiper, one for
cars without the rear wiper.

Reading recent articles about boosting power in 944S, 951 etc. I
am getting power hungry myself and I only own a 85/2 944 (don't
ask me to buy 951 or 911 since I have only had this car for over
a month).

I would like to hear about the options that are available to extract
more power with the existing power plant:

  - I have heard about Authority chip upgrade. So I would like
    to get their phone number along with any personal experiences
    and technical info about the boost in HP and torque curve for
	85-87 944.

  - I have often thought about installing a Turbo, but I don't know
    whether it is possible or whether one is available. How easy is
	this conversion mechanically and would it all fit under my hood
    without major modification? Cost of-course?
 
  - What other options are available to me. This is nice clean car
    with less than 40k on it, so I wouldn't mind spending since I
    think that its a keeper :-}

I want to put in a plug for people learning how to work on their 911's. 
I'm not disagreeing with Stan - he's right, you definitely _can_ goof up
one of these engines big time if you're not careful.  But there's no black
magic or witchcraft in the stock 911 engines, and you _don't_ need to be a
Black Forest elf to touch them.

What you _do_ need to work on these engines for the first time is:

1) the factory manuals - everyone else has said it too, but it's worth
repeating.  And a cheap investment when you consider what they can save you
from damaging!

2) lots of patience and time - read and learn about the engine before and
as you work on it.  Learn about the particular sealants recommended, and
the parts that cannot be re-used in the car (ie. rod bolts), and the
updates or modifications you should make to whatever year engine you're
rebuilding.

3) cleanliness - make sure every part you assemble is cleaner than the
dishes you eat off of...maybe lots cleaner!

4) the right tools - granted, you're never going to use that 42 mm crowfoot
for anything else, but...  It's worth investing in good tools for this
engine, and their cost is almost always less than letting a qualified shop
do the work for you.

5) more patience

Sure, the 911 has some unique tricks needed for proper assembly, but
nothing diligent reading (Anderson's book, the factory manuals, this net)
won't teach you.  And part of what makes the 911 such a neat car is that
even as a backyard mechanic, you _can_ learn about it, drive it, and work
on it.  The car can be a great hobby once you get over the initial "hands
off" phobia.

Now, I'm no expert like several of the others on this net, but I _do_ have
fun learning about and working on my 911 as a weekend mechanic, and knowing
how it works makes me that much fonder of it.  It's a great feeling to
respect and understand but not be intimidated by the mechanicals and the
wonderful engineering in the 911!

The August issue of Excellence magazine contains an article entitled

Hubbard.  The question of why you don't gain much (and can lose
efficiency) by sticking, for example, a 930 K27 turbo in a 951 is
addressed there.  Included are reproductions of the KKK compressor
maps for both the K26 (in the 951) and the K27 which are used in some
efficiency calculations described in the article.  I assume the K26
map is for the pre-Turbo S version (based on the 1982 date at the
bottom).  It might be instructive to repeat the calculations described
in the article using the original and Turbo S K26 maps, if the latter
can be found somewhere.

Although this would be an interesting test if done in a controlled side-by-side
comparison (i.e. same brand/model of tire, environmental conditions, etc.). The
relevance of different tests done by different testers over a span of years
when compared together won't mean a thing.  Tire technology alone could make
any car on the list outperform the others if it is equipped with current tires
and the others' with older generation(s) of tires....

Let's see, circa '72, Perelli Cinturato's were hot, mid-'70s CN-36s, late '70s
P-7s, Early '80s....

If I could have my wish for this type of year-to-year comparison, I'd
like to see something like the testing Grass Roots Motorsports does (a
magazine for us shoestring racers).  They try to make as objective a
comparison as possible but with real world (read performance) tests like
skidpad, preset course, etc..

Subject: Skidpad and tests


Scott,

Between you and I, this is what I recall, the 1973 911S dialed in at 
.82g in 1973 on CN-36 Pirellis. The 1978 Turbo dialed in at .89g on 
P-7s. We have found that the test figures were a factor of the test
driver's skill as well as the car. I always put stock in Ron Grable's
road tests because he was a pretty fair driver, consistant and an
engineer who understood test methodology. He pissed off Porsche by 
proving that a thrashed 924 Turbo was a better driver's car than a 944
in every aspect. 

I wouldn't put much creedance in a lot of the figures published. Jap 
cars do well statistically because their marketeers know that their
public will believe almost anything they say. They also know that a 
specially produced "ringer" will make better sales, even though what 
they sell doesn't come near the performance figures stated. A good
example is the Accura Integra with 180 (JIS) HP. Should be a rocket, 
but my wife's 924 puts them away. They go great with the gearing they 
have as it's set up to get a great 0 -60 time. Passing or hill climbing
means you have to shift down a lot. 

The thing that still makes Porsche unique is that they meet their 
minimum specs on what they sell. I'd believe the sales literature 
figures.

If I were evaluating a car for a magazine, I'd have one of my school 
courses with a slalom, constant radius circle, offset boxes and then
a large course combining those courses.  This tells me about hazard
avoidance, off-ramp speed, passing, transients and acceleration and 
braking in the 30 to 75 MPH rang, where most people drive. In box stock 
form most cars fail this miserably because the comprimises made are
too great to overcome with decals or spiffy paint. I tried a new Z-28 
Camaro this way, don't mess with them, they are a little better than a 
C-2 RS America in most aspects. The Mustang, on the other hand, is a
straight line car.

So much for my Friday grumblings.

Hoping faraway experts can help me with my 911T engine-in-a-basket.  Actually
not that bad till I got to the oil tank.  Seller acknowledged he was short one
oil hose, BUT the oil hose he gave me is neither of the ones I need.  

Engine is 71 911 T.  Oil tank is mongrel:  Brazed-on fitting on oil-tank input
(from crankcase/pump) is about 26mm diameter.  Either end of hose (44 in. long,
aluminum L-bend at one end) fits this fitting.  Brazed-on fitting on oil-tank
output (to base of oil-cooler) is about 29mm, same as the oil cooler.

My guess is that the hose I have was part of an external oil-cooler setup and
is useless to me.  And that the brazed on fittings modify a newer oil tank to
use hoses contemporary with my engine.  

Does this sound right?  I'd love confirmation before ordering; Tweeks, PProds,
Automotion don't give fitting specs on hoses.  From what I've seen on the net,
one of you guys probably has everything I need memorized.

According to Porsche, the 924T can be fitted with up to 6J x 16 rims in
a 52.3 or 53.0 mm offset.  There are a whole bunch of different OEM rim

Well the good news is that I went to the PCGB Annual Concours
at Castle Donnington. I saw hundreds of Porsche, ranging from
exquisite to ratty condition. Some 356 in better shape than
when they rolled off the production line. Hundreds of 911 from
every period including some excellent early RS, what can I say,
I have never seen such a great display. Imagine your local
supermarket carpark, then imagine it filled with 911s et al.
This was such a great display that I am already  looking forward
to next year.

I also met a  fellow porschephile (Richard Cole) Nice 72 2.4
if I remember - with the essential external oil filler flap!

The bad news is that on Friday 13th I trashed the front suspension
on my 88 Carerra and thus was the only 911 owner in the UK who
was not at the Concours sans 911 :-(

I know it's bad form to quote one's own postings, but I feel that my

my 2 week vacation that starts today. And only me to blame!

I am glad to report that my Porsche enthusiasm is undiminished
by the experience, and I am having real trouble resisting the
nagging desire to spend my retirement savings (yes I'm only 33
and saving for retirement -I know that its a sad and loosing thing
to do!), and get another Porsche, ostensibly for my SO, only trouble is
that she wants a black 356c and I want a white 92 Carrera RS.

Speak to y'all after my vacation.

Subject: 914 rear springs

I co-drove another Street Prepared 914 this weekend at an autocross.  This
one is much more stiffly sprung than mine -- the rear springs are cut-down
Saab front springs, so we have no clue what the spring rate is.

I've decided that my car is too softly sprung.  I've got 21mm front torsion
bars, 140# rear springs, and stock sway bars.  I had thought that if I
stiffen it up too much, then without a roll cage, I'll just be flexing the
chassis rather than the suspension.  This is an autocross car, BTW.

Now, I'm thinking of making it stiffer.  I'll probably spring for
Automotion's "914 Sport Spring Kit" (page 88), because infinitely-adjustable
spring perches seem like a good idea (provided that metal upper spring seat
is legal -- I'll have to check that).

This kit comes with your choice of 150#, 200#, 225#, 250#, 275#, or 300#
springs.  300 pound springs in a 914?  Isn't this just a little extreme?
I was thinking of perhaps 150# springs with a bigger sway bar, or 200#
springs with the current stock bar, since a bigger bar is likely to lift
the inside rear and cause wheelspin.  What are other people out there
using for 914 rear springs?

Thanks for any thoughts.

A co-worker is looking at early 911's.  He wants something simple and easy
to work on (i.e. pre-emissions), and relatively cheap.  I figure a
911E or 911T from '69-'73, or possibly a '74 something, could be just the
thing.  Am I right?

What's the price range of these cars?  If we ignore the 911S, are they
relatively inexpensive?  What's the ballpark price of a car in decent

Mark,

For the street and an Un-spoilered rear on a 914, I'd limit the spring 
rate to 180 lbs. The higher rates work really well when you start adding
downforce and have to compensate.

My 914/6 didn't have a rear spoiler, I used 23mm torsion bars in the 
front with adjustable perch 180# spings, special Carrera shocks. I ALSO
used a 27mm front swaybar and a 22mm rear. In PCA events I had a record of 79 starts and 72 wins autocrossing. It works. The downside is that I
eventually broke the welds in the rear trunk floor and chose to retire 
the car after three seasons. The car was eleven years old at the time.

Just remember that the tires are stickier now and your car is twenty or 
so years old.

Do you by any chance, remember the name of the mail order places?

I tested all fuses, only thing left to test is the Relay and the
operating motor. Could someone be kind enough to suggests pointers
for testing the Motor and the Relay. The price of Relay is negligible
compared that to the price of Motor, so I am hoping to resolve this

Could someone be kind enough to detail the:

   - Steps involved to test Relay on the headlight motor?

Cannot help you with painting but I also have a few small chips
on my car and I find those bottles very annoying. What I found to
work best was the ColorMagic polish by Turtle Wax. It does not fill
the chips and scratches as well as they claim but it does not leave
the white spot on drying. I used it (paste type) for the first time
on my car a few weeks ago and am satisfied with the result.

P.S.
  If you plan on using this stuff, spend a few bugs and get
  yourself a pair of rubber gloves, as this stuff will changes the
  skin-color of your hands. In your case (Maroon), you might end up with
  blood color hands, which will last for 3 to 4 days.

Subject: RE: Springs


I'd recommend it this way:

Stock front torsion bars (17mm) with 140# rears. no rear sway bar, 19mm
front.
19mm front torsion bars with 160# rears, same front sway bar
19mm front torsion bars with 180# rears, 22mm front bar
22mm front torsion bars with 180# rears, 22mm front bar, 15 mm rear bar
23mm front torsion bars with 205# rears, 22mm front bar, 15 mm rear

Get the picture? Don't be tempted to run the car too low, front or rear,
try to maintain at least 4 inches of clearance under the car, this means
that the lower a-arms in the front will be parallel to the ground, the 
body should never set lower than the height of the lower ball joint as
the car rests. The rocker panel should sit level, front to rear. This
should get you full suspension travel and correct camber gain front and
rear. Use the adjustable spring perches for weigh balancing the corners,
I convinced SCCA once that I used the adjustable perches to keep my car
at stock ride height. 

If you run the car at a lower ride height, you won't get as much weight transfer, but then the body will take the beating that the suspension
should be taking. The car has to be reengineered to take advantage of 
the lower height, almost all the modifications necessary are illegal
in PCA and SCCA as they involve machining and the components are no longer as delivered (stock classes + production by PCR definition).

Subject: 911 CD ignition dwell meter hookup


   Could someone with the manual or who has done it before tell me how to hookup 
   a dwell meter to a point driven CD ignition on a 911?

   I know that the standard hookup to the point feed does not work.

I think it does work, you just need the right equipment.

A normal dwell meter used on a '64 Beetle will possibly damage the CD
unit on the CD ignition. On the Beetle, the points ground the coil to
fire it. On the CD ignition, the points ground the CD box which in
turn sends voltage to the transformer (like the coil) to fire it. BUT,
you can't hook up a run-of-the-mill dwell meter to the points because
it can damage the CD box by sending a voltage spike through the meter
and into the CD amp.

You need either an inductive dwell meter or a high impedance
(electronic) dwell meter. If you have the later then simply hook up
the red to 12V on the fuse panel and the black to the feed coming from
the distributor to the CD box. 

The same rule applies to hooking up a tachometer to any part of the
ignition, be careful and remember the "coil" is not being grounded the
same way as the Beetle.

	Monty, my procedure for touching up rock chips etc. is as follows:
		
	Get a good artists brush approx 1/8" dia, or smaller, better yet
	get a selection to suit various chip sizes.

	Acquire some lacquer thinner, and a metal or glass cup to hold a
	small quantity of same, use to keep the paint thinned and easy to flow.
	I put thinner about 1/8 inch deep in a cofee mug, and dip brush in 
	thinner prior to dipping into the touch up paint. Also use edge of 
	cup as you would an artist palette to insure paint viscosity is 
	correct.

	Clean the rock chip with a wax remover or solvent.

	Apply paint to the chipped area in several coats, building up to 	
	the level of the surrounding paint. Let cure thouroghly.

	Purchase some 1000 or 1500 grit wet or dry sandpaper, and make a 
	small sanding block out of hard rubber or wood, approx. size 1"X 1.5".
	Wet Sand the projecting surface, which you have built up, down to the
	surrounding level. This may require several itterations to get it
	flat. Use caution to minimize the orignal paint material that you
	sand away. Do not break through the Clear Coat.

	When it is flat, then rub it out with rubbing compound, and polish
	with the various grades of Meguiar's polish. Protect the job with a
	good coat of wax.

	If your hood has a large quantiy of chips, you can fill the voids as 
	described above, and Wet Sand/Color Sand the entire hood, and polish 
	it out, in it's entirety, or in smaller areas. I did this to good effect
	on my 911. Amazing how much clear coat there is on the contemporary
	Porsche finishes.

Folks,
My 87 924s with c. 82,OOO has just had a clean break in the exhaust system at
the front of the catalytic converter . Looks to be about  at the point where
the pipe to the exhaust manifold would be welded to the cat. con.  Is this a
good description and is it to be expected?  Foreign Service of McLean Va. is
repairing it welding it  with a possible worst case 2-!/2 hrs. labor . Sound
reasonable?
When changing the oil they discovered that the front balance shaft cover
(plastic?) was cracked due to a supposed forward movement of the balance shaft
because of a purported missing/broken clip whose verification involves the kind
of disassembling  usually accompanying replacement of the timing/balance shaft
belts c. 6-1/2 hours labor.
Sound resonable?  While they are in there, I'll probably be well advised to
replace the belts which have c. 20,000 miles
Have either of above happened to other 924s- 944 owners?

I hook my meter to the wire on the side of the distributor that goes to the

another  rust throught about 3" wide.  The 2.0L has been converted to carbs
(Booo) dual Webbers.   

      When I arrived to look at this car If started great but when we went
to put it in gear it would not go.  It was as if the clutch was stuck.  After
a coupe of attempts to get it in gear we just let if warm up and after 5 minutes
it started working.  Should I be worred about this???  I was told the car was
hauled from CA to Indiana in 89 and has not been licensed in IN so I assume It 
has not been driven too much, owner said less then 200 miles in 4 years. 

      So now for the bad things.  It looks like a kid owned the car and tried
to make it look really cool.  It has the front spoiler, the plastic rocker 
covers with the Porsche in raised letters.  Some one cut the door panels to 
install stereo speakers and mounted a amp on the side of the center console
(Ouch).  Some also installed a alarm and know all the wires and switches are 
still there.  


   So my question what is this car worth??  Should I be worried about the
clutch problem??  Should I be worried about the carb converstion??  Is their
any problems special with CA cars???


   Thanks for the information and help.

According to Pat, these are plentiful and inexpensive in California.
I've yet to see any listed for sale out East on in Pano, but I'd like
to find out more about them.

When I asked this question previously, Steve Timmins replied:

So now I'm confused.  Are the early 928 7x15 wheels 53.3mm offset?
Are they the same phone dials as the 944s? If so, why are they so
plentiful and inexpensive?  If not, how do they differ? Are there
6x15 wheels available in that same style, so I can have matching
fronts (I'm presuming that I would have to modify the front suspension
to use 7x15s there, which is something I currently don't want to do)?

And just how does one measure wheel offset?

There are three moving parts here:

1) the "base set" -- the '65-71 

2) the "supplement" -- in this case, the '72-83 *AND* '84-89 sets

3) the "updates" -- which are sent out by PCNA to dealers, "subscribers",
   etc. -- you want to make sure your manual set has the most current

   PLEASE any one with a set (partial or otherwise) what is the minimal
   requirement?? Which must I buy to get me started?

Each set of manuals builds on information previously presented so you
will need them all BUT, (there's always a "but") if you are going to
be doing most of your work on '84-on Carrera models then the
information in Volumes 1 and 2 (to '71) will be *very* outdated since
most assemblies are upgraded and the changes detailed in later
sections. For example everything about the front suspension, clutch,
interior, electrics, fuel injection and exhaust et al. is not really
applicable. So one option is to get only the Carrera set and rely on
the Haynes manual to substitute for the Vol 1-6. This is a cost
cutting measure but I think it would work rather well.

	Howdy all,

	I am finally going to buy a flatbed trailer for the Honda CRX and
the Porsche 914.  Now that I have a REAL tow vehicle I can retire the
tow dolly.  I have been advised by a number of different people that
I should get a dual axle traler with electric brakes on both axles.

	My final decision now is what length trailer to get.  I can
get either a 15 or 18 foot trailer (length of the deck.)  Their overall
lengths are 21' and 23' respecitvely.  They both have dual axles, 4 electric
brakes, 5' ramps, spare tire, lights, etc (no breakaway kits).

	The Honda CRX is REALLY short, and the Porsche is only 13' long.
The length of the cars isn't the problem.  I would like to add a toolbox
and tire rack to the front of the trailer.  Adding this tire rack and box
makes me wonder whether I should go with the 18' vs the 15'.  Does anyone 
have experience doing this?  If so how did you:

	- What length trailer did you get?
	- How much did it weigh?
	- How did you balance the trailer with the added tongue weight?
	- Where did you build the box (on or in front of the deck)?
	- How did the box open (was the fron hinged or the top)?
	- Where did you build the tire rack (on or in front of the box)?
	- Did building the box / tire rack have an impact on fuel milage?

	I would appreciate any suggestions/comments that people who
have flatbed trailers.  These things are expensive, and I would like 
to get the right thing the _first_ time!

This *doesn't* seem reasonable! The balance shaft will never slide forward
enough to hit the plastic cover. It is held in place by a bearing (and the
associated bearing cap) that snugly fits between two rotating weights.
Something else must have cracked the plastic cover (maybe the mechanic :-).

The relay is a simple SPST type, if I remember correctly.  Look at the 
diagram on its side and swap with a similar one from your fuse box or 
another German car (VW, BMW, etc.).  The problem could be in the 
headlight switch itself, or the sliding contacts within the motor 
assembly.  Check if you're getting power to the motor assembly during 
up/down attempted motion.

Subject: 944 clutch (or hydraulics, or voodoo)

Hi gang,

Seeking the collective net wisdom before I decide to park the car in
East Palo Alto.....

Ok, when Paul bought the 944, he noticed that the clutch never would
stay adjusted.  (Kevin, sorry we never got back to you about this.)
The car would creep at a stoplight, and the Porsche mechanics could only
find that the slave cylinder was in need of repair.  This game went on
through four slave cylinders.  (I joined the party about the time of
the fourth one.)  At a recent 'must-fix' episode, the clutch was doing
the same thing.  This time the clutch master was replaced, and the 
clutch stayed adjusted for a day (standard operating procedure).  This 
time the clutch went to 'negative' free-play and slipped.  The pedal
height was higher than the brake pedal.  So, Paul readjusted the clutch
pedal, and it is okay (only been a day).  

I think seven mechanics have been involved in this thus far and no one 
has any ideas, and all tell us that 944's just don't do this.  

Some of you know I have a messed up left knee, and the clutch pumping
that becomes required in these episodes is not helping the surgeon's
artwork.  Hence, Paul has been considering selling the car.  If we
could find a fix for the wandering clutch pedal we would be more
inclined to keep the car.

In response to the question of what to do with wheels:

I haven't done this to Porsche wheels yet (I gave those to my alignment
friend) but if you mount a tire (preferably not steel-belted) on each 
wheel you can then cut around the tires at the beginning of the 
tread and turn them inside out.  It takes a little bit of effort, but 
when you are finished painting them you have a rather unique planter.  
I have done this to my rice-burner wheel that tried to fall off my car, 
and here I have either Mercedes or BMW wheels painted Stanford Navajo
White.  A large rock, brick, or stone over the center reduces the amount
of dirt you need.  Perhaps planting flowers to complement the color of
your car....  

We used to use these planters between garage doors.

Emissions?  What emissions?  The mechanical fuel injection was so wonderful
that they didn't need anything extra.  There was a cold start air preheater

dirt into the air filter, but that's about it.  Oh, and the standard

Subject: 911 S calipers for sale

I have a friend who just put on some Wilwoods, and wants to sell his
S calipers. I think he's nuts, but if he wants to sell them, I guess
I can't stand in his way...

He's asking $425 for the pair, plus shipping. Just off a car, working
when they came off. Let me know (direct e-mail, please) if you're
interested...

Subject: 924/944 HEADLAMP MOTOR REBUILDING


The motors which raise the 924/944 headlamps do go bad after some
time.  With the ridiculous cost of new motors, you can rebuild/repair
the old ones without too much trouble.  (This goes for windshield
wiper and window regulator motors as well.)  Before you do, look and
listen to the motor to get clues of the failure:

* Motor heard spinning but no shaft movement: stripped gear, sorry.  
* Motor hums or grinds, little or no output: Bad bearing or rust in the
    motor, fixable.
* Erratic or slow movement: bad brushes/commutators or bad switch
    contacts, fixable.
* No sound or movement: see above.  Also check voltage at motor.


The beasts are your average universal motors (carbon brush/permanent
magnet stator) with a gear reduction output and position sensing
switch contacts in one assembly.  Removal of two large Phillips screws
will enable the can to be removed.  Two permanent magnets are glued to
the inside of the can; re-glue if necessary and remove any rust from
the can and the magnet faces.  If you re-glue, be sure there are no
magnet chips or metal filings under the magnet, clean parts thoroughly
with carb cleaner, use a strong epoxy, and get it FLAT against the
can.

There are two bearings for the rotor: one simple sleeve bearing which
is captive (but swivelable) at the back of the can, and a sealed ball
bearing assembly at the output shaft end.  The ball bearing is the one
which typically fails; if the rotor does not spin freely you'll have
to replace it (a competent bearing shop will be able to match it; I
can supply a number if ya need one).  In order to get this bearing,
you have to open the gear reduction box and remove the large plastic
gear. Inspect this gear: if it's stripped, you're screwed (so to
speak).  Next, remove the spring clip on the output shaft which holds
it in the frame.  As you slide the shaft out, BE CAREFUL not to lose
the springs behind the carbon brushes.

While the rotor is out, the bearing can be pressed off.  Also at this
time, clean the commutator contacts with fine sandpaper and then a rag
and some carb cleaner.  Use a wire brush or a metal pick in the
direction of the rotor shaft axis to remove crud from between the
commutator contacts as well.  Inspect the brushes and replace them if
they are nearly gone (I've never had to).  Sand any rust off the rotor
laminations (it can rub against the magnets) and lightly WD-40 the
laminations to prevent future rust.

Reassemble the rotor into the frame, with the new ball bearing in
place, and springs behind the brushes.  It's a bit tricky to hold all
the brushes back as you slide the rotor in, but it can be done... use
toothpicks to hold the brushes in if you need to.  Also, keep grease
and oil away from the brushes!

The toughest part of the whole job is putting the can back on.  The
magnets are very strong and they will try to pull the rotor away from
the sleeve bearing unless you're careful.  Make sure you realign the
sleeve bearing each time you attempt to mate it to the rotor.  It may
take a bunch of tries; put the can in a vise to hold it steady and
good luck!

The last step is the gears and switch contacts.  Remove all the
grease and sand the rotating contacts to remove pits and grooves.
Repack the unit with grease and put on the lid. YER DONE!  Be sure to
cycle the motor once or twice outside the car to see if it works and
also to reset it at the start/stop point.

Subject: Tires -- low profile

I'd like some education on low profile tires, because as I was thinking about
the subject the other day, I realized that I'm not clear on it.

Years ago, the standard profile was 70. Now our Porsches have 55 or 50. Some
cars have a low as 35.

I can easily see that the lower the profile the more *precise* the
steering/handling will be, since there is less sidewall to deflect.
Question: do low profile tires also have greater ultimate grip? Are they
more or less prone to lifting the contact patch? (I could visualize that
they would be *more* prone to this problem.) They will tend to give less
warning at the limit, right? Other attributes?

Comments solicited.

 914 galley(?) plug
Hi, again.
    I just got back from vacation, and had a small disaster yesterday with my
74 1.8L.  I started the car to let it warm up, and the oil light came back on.
I shut the beast down, and jumped out to look under the car.  Oil.  Lots and
lots
of oil.  Just pouring down onto the parking lot.
    When I got home from work last night, I checked under the car.  I found a
small metal disc, which is hollow on one side.  I think that it's a Galley
Plug,
or Freezer Plug.  It was in the area that the leak dripped directly onto.
  1)  What is the correct name for this thing?
  2)  Where (on the block, I presume) did it come from?
  3)  How was it originally held in?
  4)  Should I get a new one, or just use some goop to put it back?
  5)  (the big one)  Do I need to drop the engine to put it back in?
  6)  Why would it come out, and how can I prevent more of this?

    I really would hate to have the engine out for a cheap little plug.
Thanks for any advice and/or sympathy.

Judging from recent postings, buying the right 911 will result in a
lower-maintenance car than the 944. I bought an '88 944 last year
and have since then replaced the timing belts, water pump. starter
motor, fixed a blown oil-cooler, resealed the transmission housing,
and most recently replaced the clutch, pressure plate, and throwout bearing.
Also had to have a warped flywheel machined out (guess I waited too long
to fix the clutch). I think I hit most of the major items right away,
but I think every 40K miles or so another round hits (from what I
understand). I still like the car, though! Just very expensive to
keep running.

Chris,
	I think that you should buy a 944. Mine to be exact. It is
for sale: $9200. '86 944, Guards Red, Tan partial leather interior.
Excellent overall condition. No wrecks, no rust, great paint, Houston 
car. Cold A/C, always garaged (home and work), car cover included, 
78,500 miles, recent rebuilt transaxle, waterpump, powersteering pump, 
timing belts always replaced <30k miles (current has < 10k miles), 
timing belt pulleys/gears replaced near 57K miles, no oil leaks
( complete front and pan reseal done with last timing belt ), oil 
changed every 3k miles or sooner, two new, two fair Michelen XGTV 
tires on original Phone Dial 15x7 rims, I have receipts/records,
plus microfiche of shop manuals. All in all, runs great, looks great,
great price, but I'd like to buy something different. I've driven 
it for 5 years. This car is extremely easy to drive very fast and
handles great. You'll get no debate from any one on that. It is a
neutral handling car, very forgiving, and FUN! 


Every one else, if Chris doesn't snap it up, it's for sale. If you're
not close to Houston, there are several people on porschephiles you
might be able to get to look at the car who live in this area.

If you're interested, send me email at address below, 
or call me (713) 374-0379

Subject: re: looking for an  early 911

Having just been through the "looking for an early 911" routine and
spending 11 months and a lot of bandwidth doing it ;^) , I think I can
comment on this.

Wade Guthrie sez:


   First of all, I'd stay FAR AWAY from '74 and late '73 cars.  They tend to over-
   heat and, hence, are real dogs.  There was emissions stuff on the '69-'73 cars,
   but, I believe (and I'll be corrected, if I'm wrong :->), not a whole lot.  You
   could go simpler and do a pre-'69 machine.

First, late 73 cars are supposed to be some of the more desirable because
of the CIS, 2.4 motor, 915 gearbox, etc, relative to early cars, and certainly
relative to anything 75-77.  Also, 74's are a mixed bag:  They do not have
the dread thermal reactors, but they do have the 2.7 motor which in original
form tends to pull it's own head bolts.  A rebuilt one, or one with a 3.0 SC motor
could be pretty cool, given how light they are.  On the other hand, subjectively,
74's have the new style bumpers, etc. which are controversial.

Rather than talk about specific cars, the overall strategy is 
important with old Porsches:

Conventional widom suggests that if you are serious and want a car for the
long run, save until you can afford an SC (>78) as you will spend less
in the long run even if it costs you more up front.  Conversely, don't
fall for the first semi-acceptable 69E you come across and start the
inevitable rationalization process, (I know it smokes and leaks a lot,
but it's got a great dashboard and all the guages work! and that little
bit of rust is no big deal, and only one of the door panels is
trashed.  Besides it's got new batteries, new MPG MIZER tires, and a
cool aftermarket muffler.  And god I love how it sounds.....  Sure all my
friends think I'm crazy, but they all drive K cars and have no imagination) 
especially if it's cheap, because you can quickly get hosed ie: twice
as much money in to it than it's worth. The agony we go thru in this
process is the stuff of Greek tragedy.

WHO ON THIS LIST HASN'T BOUGHT AT LEAST ONE CAR THIS WAY?  :-)

I bought an MG like this when I was 18 and had to tear it down one week later.
You can afford this with an MG but not with an old 911 unless you

A) are single
B) have no friends to laugh at you, and
C) have unlimited funds.

To avoid the above, do the following:

A) Research, study, and figure out what you really want/can afford to support
B) Be patient
C) Find a good mechanic to do a pre-purchase check on your short list
   cars.
D) Drive a lot of cars to build up your database.

Subject: Re: 944 clutch (or hydraulics, or voodoo)

Pam and Paul -

I've never heard of quite this problem before.  But it's pretty clear
that 944's do do this sort of thing, because yours does.

The master and slave cylinders should not be much of an issue.  All you
need to do is check that, when the clutch pedal is depressed, you get
adequate travel of the release fork.  I think spec is something like a
min. of 15 mm.  It's easily measure at the inspection port in the clutch
bell housing.

While you're there, double-check that there's adequate material left
on the friction plate.  Again, the spec is in the workshop manual and
measurement is simple.

Of course, check for any trauma which might seriously misalign your
engine and transaxle.  Check esp. the motor mounts.

I suspect the root cause of your problem will be the pressure plate in
the clutch.  It is essentially a huge Belleville washer which presses
the friction disk against the flywheel.  Mechanically, it sort of "wants"
to be in one of two states.  When your foot is off the clutch, it relaxes
and pushes the back of the friction disk.  When you depress the clutch,
the throw-out bearing pushes the pressure plate back, disengaging the
friction disk from the pressure plate.

Sounds like you are not getting enough travel of the pressure plate between
the two states.  Pressure plates do get tired, which is why they get
replaced as part of your basic clutch job.

It is always possible that something else is wrong in your clutch.  I would
check the release fork for damage, and its two bearings for damage and
play.  It is also possible that a previous owner of the car put the
wrong pressure plate (or whatnot) in the car.

I hope this helps.  And stay the hell away from mechanics who:

 a) replace the same part four times, and
 b) tell you your car doesn't do what it's doing!

But don't feel too bad.  Alain Prost has had exactly this problem all
year.  A few of his botched starts have been because he's had to keep
his foot on the brake up until the green flag dropped.  But does he call
me for help?  Noooo.

Hi all,

the last time I posted a message,
I was kicking, screaming and crying about the number of 
expensive repairs I had on my 944 ('86, 65000 miles)
after a bit more than a year of ownership.
At the rate I was going, pretty soon my mechanic
would have been able to afford a Rolls Royce
on my account (just a bit of exageration...).

The latest episode in the continuing saga of my 
repairs has been a steering leak which was supposed 
to cost me around 1000 $ but that I ingenouisly fixed 
for 5$. Now, how would you ask?? A porsche repaireman 
would not even give you a smile for 5$ you say??!

The key is to heal the seals by putting some 
classical music and some ointment that makes them expand
(sold in all automotive stores/ no prescription necessary).
If you do it with tender love and care, the leak disapears
and never comes back. You drive happily ever after
worrying only about such spiritual things as 
your next stereo upgrade...

PCA, however (and as a few of us already know) is an extremely

Resistance to this idea may come from unexpected places.  Note also I

Before I start even working on a proposal for what such a region would

It does sound like a galley plug, and CONGRATULATIONS! you now get

case as well...). It's that you want to fix *WHY* it came out in the
first place.

Common causes are seized oil pressure relief valves, obstructed oil
passages, plugged oil coolers, using SAE 90W in the engine, etc.

These things are press-fit into the case, driven in with a special
drift to a certain depth. If you're a fanatic, and race, the hot
setup is to tap the galleys and use a threaded plug with an allen

I would go to the local PCA events, try an autocross or several,

'83 944s are more difficult to chip as you must send your computer box
to AutoThority to have the chips replaced (they must first solder in a
socket, then they provide you with a press-in chip as well as a stock
chip).  Gains are noticeable but not phenominal.

As I have mentioned on the net before, if you want autothority chips, I
am a registered dealer and will beat any price in Pano.  

FOr the 944, a good thing to get is the throttle response cam.  It
retails for $40.  If you want that only get it direct from Auto th since
my discount isn't worth shipping it to me and then to anyone else unless
chips accompany.

Chris,

Chips are fun, however, the early 944 computer board had the PROM
soldered to the board. This will be a job for a good electronics tech
that has a repairs facility for Electronic modules.

Another solution would be to go to the 85 1/2 and later module, not a
task to try in your living room. Some vendors offer an exchange service
for the earlier modules, they usually install a socket for the PROM,
something the later modules have.

I converted to the later module, it's a little harder than I can 
explain here.

Subject: Problem with 924 K Jet injection?


Hi,

I have a problem with my '79 924. I've recently put a new engine in
after 120K miles. Everything has gone fine during the run in the engine
has mechanically settled down nicely.

My problem is that it seems to run very slightly rougher than it used
to when it was first installed, and worse subtle throttle responses
cause no reaction.

 To change the engine speed on the flat from say 2000 to 2200 rev takes
 1/4-1/3 throttle pedal movement rather than the 1/8-1/4 type of push.
After this amount the engine will then surge...so you have to back off
again.
 When you back off, to slow from 2200 to 2000... the reverse happens
 the engine surges onward.. It's a pain trying to drive in traffic!

If you drive fast the engine has no problem at all... Plenty of power
plenty of response!

I've had the car on a SNAP-ON type scope.. The box of tricks reckons
that no 2 is a little on the spark.. which may means either the
ignition leads etc are poor or a weak mixture.

I've checked the ignition that checks out OK so I guess that leaves the
injection. I know little about this (all my cars up to this point have
had carbs), so I'm looking for advice? Should I change the injector?
Any other ideas?

I put an Autothority chip in my '88 944. It is very easy to put in. You can 
feel a difference at higher rpms (>4000) but it is hardly startling. You need
to use premium gas if you weren't already, though. I have had it in a long
time and have experienced no problems with the car. I believe that Authority
recommends improved exhaust mods with the earlier 944s for maximum effect.

Over the years Automotion has come up with a table of what (usually)

This table resides on page 117 of the 1993 catalog. 

To the left of the table is a chart with the OEM torsion bars for all

I'd believe the charts, the 944 and 924 charts reflect my experience and

Subject: chipping


I just would like to give some additional warnings on the
subject of chipping.
To assembly a computer board whithout having latent defects built
into it is almost imossible. Environmental Stress Screening (or Burn-In)
is therefore (in general) used to sort these defects out before the
computers are placed in a car. 
A repair (e.g. changing the PROM by soldering) can therefore introduce
defects if the one who is doing the job isn't very skilled. You *could*
end up with a situation with a computer that works well for a month or
so after the chipping but then fails. The failure is then probably not
the PROM, but an other failure that  may leed to the scrapping of the board.

Observe that this is the general philosphy, I don't have any statistical
evidence on this for Bosch computers (but for other electronic devices).
So, be cautios when chipping requires soldering and
don't try to mess with it yourself unless you e.g. work with soldering
in your profession.

} Hi, regarding the 944 chipping ,I have a few questions,
} 1. The torque/hp numbers you stated, are these measured on the rear wheels ?
Yes, rear wheel with come correction factor.  If you're wondering whay
they are lower then stock it's because the drivetrain sucks up some
horsepower.  What's relevent is not the absolute numbers but the increas
(percentagewise) in HPO at the rear wheels.$
} 2. The modifications of the ignition/fuel/timing etc. curves, are these applied
}  only to the full throttle position, or also on part throttle ?
They use an econonmy corrected surface up to about 1/2 throttle and
below about 3000 rpm.  Thiis is belnded to a performance map.  In this
way it is possible to improve both cruising economy and horsepower.  The
same is done with the turbo chips.  

n driving to florida with muy chipped turbo I got 27mpg.  I beleive
thtat's better than I would have gotten otherwise (25-26?).  In any even
t you should experience marginal savings if you keep you foot out of it.

That probably doesn't have 10% ethanol in it, right?!  Some of the "cheap"

Subject: 944 clutch problems


Pam and Paul et al,

I had very similar clutch problems with another brand
of German car - clutch wouldn't stay adjusted, etc. and
got terminally worse.

The problem turned out to be a cracked metal bracket that
would flex, then return to its normal position. I've 
also heard of metal fatigue or weld failures at the 
pedal assembly.

I'm not sure where the stress points are with the slave
cylinder set up, but it's probably worth half an 
investigation with a flashlight before you think of
replacing the clutch. 

Good luck,

Hello everyone,

While we are on the subject of clutches that won't stay adjusted...

What is the proper way to repair a 914 when the clutch tube rips out down by
the pan (near the front of the engine)?

When this happened to mine a few years ago I simply (?) took out the tube,
built a small, slotted bracket out of HEAVY steel, bolted this to the floor
pan and let the tube rest against this.  I also welded the tube back in the
tunnel between the seats.

My solution wasn't very pretty but it did seem to work.  How has everyone
else fixed this problem?

Thanks,

I'm no expert, but a friend who works for Chevron was telling me that
there are 2 octane ratings, and the cheap gas companies boost only
one of them using some cheap chemical additive. As I remember, one
of octane ratings is important under low load, and one under heavy
load. Cheap gas also doesn't have the detergent additives (for carbon

Subject: 944 Noise


Hi everyone,

   I have noticed a new sound coming from the back of my 87 951.
It does not seem to be related to engine speed. The faster I go the 
louder a low pitched whine gets. I had a friend of mine sit in the    
back while I drove and he says he cannot tell if it is coming from 
one side or the other. The sound is very uneven, you can hear it is
generated from wheel movement.

I suspect one of 4 things:

1. A possible bad CV joint. I am willing to take them apart and check
and repack so I probably will this weekend. What type of grease do
most people agree on?

2. A bad rear wheel bearing. If this was true I would expect the sound
to come from one side or the other. Since it seems to come out of the 
middle I expect it is not something on the wheels, it is more likely 
a differential/axle problem

3. A rear tire is out of balance, or maybe both. I think that the tires
on the rear are on the wrong side. So they are turning backward. They
are Dunlops with an arrow shaped tread, so they are supposed to turn 
one way only, right?. I just purchased this car in June so I am noticing 
weird previous owner stuff like this. But, why would the tires be on 
the wrong sides? I hope this isn't some sort of unhandyman diagnosis 
of this problem.  Anyway, will this happen if my tires are turning backward?

4. I had differential problems with my 83 944. It made wierd vibrations
when I turned a corner. I solved the problem with new fluid in the 
transmission. Then, I sold it so I don't know if it was a permanent fix.
I think it was. I am going to put synthetic tranny fluid in this weekend
as long as I am in the vicinity of the cv joints. Anyone have any cautions
on this stuff? I have only heard rave reviews. What brand/viscosity?

Anyway the noise is pretty loud and I hate noise,  so, anyone have any
other ideas about what this is before I start in on the rearend.

Phil Wilson 

Thanks!

This is probably correct.  Keep in mind the fact that an octane number
simply indicates the fuel's reluctance to detonation, ie, uncontrolled
pre-ignition.  More (higher) "octane" does not mean fuel which produces
more power, per se.

So, on the face of things, it would seem that running with no more than
the required octane rating would be sufficient.  But, on the other hand,
we keep hearing reports of not-to-spec fuel from some percentage of
stations out there; I've heard the number 30% bandied about.  So, popping
for the premium gas might be worthwhile if you suspect quality.

Cars with knock sensors add an interesting new wrinkle.  My car has two.
They will protect the engine from bad fuel by retarding the timing, up
to a point.  I have wondered whether they might also take advantage of
better-than-spec fuel by dialing in a little more advance.  Probst in his
book mentions a trick which works with the Bosch-managed GNX: racers
would disconnect the battery for as long as it took for the DME to forget,
then go racing (drag, I think).  This apparently worked in that it
yielded better times.

I wish I could hook up something to my DME which would tell me how much
the car is knocking.  There is a knock output signal from the DME for the
diagnostic tool, but I have no idea what kind of signal it puts out.  If
anyone has any concrete ideas, love to hear from you.

If you take a car to the track, one which is normally happy with low
octane fuel, it would probably be wise to treat it to a tank of the good
stuff.  It's pretty hard to hear detonation at red-line, especially with
a helmet on, and you will be spending a lot of time in the high RPM band.

This was not Firehawk, which is sponsored by Firestone.  This was an
altogether different series, sponsored by Michelin for which reason
these cars had to wear, ugh, Michelins.  The 968 managed to squeeze
275's on the rear.

Interesting series, and I have been tempted to perhaps enter it.  The cars
are pretty much stock, retaining their interiors.  The suspensions I
could peek at were pretty special looking, adjustable perch coil-overs
all round I think, like the Firehawkers.  Everyone was really very closed-
lipped and the hoods were kept quite closed in the pits.  Impound seemed
to have been more or less cancelled when the electronic weigh scales
went south.  By way of contrast, the Formula cars were pretty much open
to inspection and viewing in the paddock, and the paddock was open to
the public.

The Heimrath 968 was on the poll, next to a 944S2.  I didn't see the start,
being seated in the hairpin.  But the 968 and 944S2 took each other out
at the get-go.  The S2 eventually got underway, but seemed to be suffering
from some damage to its rear suspension.  Two other S2's took first and
second, the winner being sponsored by Musique Plus.

There were a whole lot of different cars, and part of the temptation to
enter comes from the fact that many of the drivers were amazingly bad!
There were guys (gender-neutral) who never made any kind of apex through
the hairpin, all over the place, no concept of a line.  I'm talking about
warm-up and qualifying sans traffic, btw.  Some of the cars were miserably
prepared, as well.

The Porsches were well driven, and there was a little Suzuki
which was quite amazing.  This econo-box would come flying into
the hairpin, and do all the right things given what the car was, very
entertaining, just driving the car to its limits.

Well, for quick-and-dirty jobs, what you did works just fine. For concours
grade repairs, we usually pull the interior and cut some holes in the
shift linkage tunnel, use a MIG welder to re-locate the tube and attach
it to the tunnel in a few more places, then fab new metal to cover the
holes, butt-weld it in, grind the welds, bondo, paint, etc. until you can't
tell it's been done.

Now think real hard: is it worth it to do that to your car? For street
914's (i.e. not Limited Editions, not 914-6s) it's usually not... A little
ugly versus a lot of money is usually an easy choice...

Subject: A new 914 on the block

Well crap. Now that I've read all of the archives it's going to be much harder
to come up with any quesions without looking like a bozo...of course I was
just searching for stuff on 914's, so there's always hope 8-)

Ah yes. Here's one. I bought a 1975 914 1.8 a couple of months back (18 years
of waiting comes to an end!). I bought it, drove it to the mechanic's place for
a little engine work, drove it home (about 2 miles), and haven't driven it
since. I have, however, managed to put about $2300 worth of parts into it (you
know, all of the weather stripping, all of those little dented/missing polished
aluminum doohickies, things with other peoples finger prints on them, etc.). I
haven't even gotten to the "real money" parts yet (the stuff that makes the car
go...what's that stuff called again?? 8-). Luckily the engine and drive train
seem to be OK (except for the little bit of grinding in 1st and 2nd -- which
could be the adjustment of the clutch, or the synchros - archives make me
smart!). The car has less than 1 square inch(!) of rust (it's lived its whole
life in New Mexico -- and I think most of its later life in someone's barn),
and probably less than 1 square foot of bondo (it received a couple of slight
booboos at some point in time).  But...it *had* one of those dealer installed
air conditioning systems. Being cool is OK, but I wasn't interested (AT ALL!)
in having that mass of black plastic hanging under the dash. So it has been
exorcised from the car. The problem now is (some of you could see this coming)
that I have a foot by foot and a half hole under the spare tire where the
cooling coils used to be (which, I think, may be the reason why the spare tire
keeps rubbing on the ground 8-).  I need that piece of metal! I really don't
want to just have any old something welded in there.  I'd rather have a piece
that matches (it's shaped to hold the spare, it has the hole that the bolt
holding the spare tire screws into, a bolt for the rear towing eye when not in
use, and it has a towing eye on the underside).  I've checked with the local
(Albuquerque) wrecking yards...no luck. Any help would be appreciated.  Now I
haven't gotten my Automotion catalog yet, nor have I joined the PCA yet (its
almost Monday -- $36, have your VISA and VIN ready), so if you can get these
kinds of parts through those sources, then I apologize (archives make me humble
too).

I've sent a note to Stan to add me to the Who's Who list. Not because I know a
lot of technical stuff (that's yet to come), but because there was only one
carlisted for New Mexico, and we can't have that. I also wanted my name on the
list because there were no other 1975 914 1.8's on the list...hey, wait a
minute...how come there ain't no other ones on the list?? If the answer is
closer to "YOU FOOL!" than it is to "Because they are fine rare works of art" I
don't wanna hear it!

If you're new, read the archives. It takes forever, but it's worth it!

Why 914's are the best cars ever built...oh, we can get into that some other

dear bill



in response to your request dated 8/9/93, one place i know of where you can get

an electric schematic is in the clymer pub. "porsche; service, repair handbook

(isbn 0-89287-060-5).  this manual gives a good outline of all systems and ranges

in model dates from 1965-1976.  i'm afraid it's been out of print since 1977, but

you may be able to pick it up from second-hand dealers.



with regards to your problem;  i have had similar problems with my 912.  after

spending a whole day chasing down circuits with a continuity tester, i found that

the problem lay in the multi-switch.  the system is intricate but crude.  it may

be that you have some corrosion or even just dirt buggering the contacts.  i

would suggest you remove the switch from the steering column (a relatively simple

procedure once the steering wheel is removed,  there are 2 screws, one top and

one bottom, and the cable trunk is modular), blow it our with compressed air, and

shine the contacts with fine sand paper.  this may solve the problem

Subject: cleaning products













dear scott,



in response to your request dated 8/11/93.



i have had some concours experience as well as the privilege of sitting in on a

few tech sessions offered by some of the top finish and detailing experts.  the

going consensus among the impartial authorities is that zymol is the best line of

products.  however, they tend to be very dear and i think only necessary if you

are in top concours.  i have found that a good alternative is mcguires products. 

i have had good success with their car wash concentrates (never use household or

dishwashing soaps--it cuts the wax and may damage the surface)  and carnauba-

based waxing pastes.  they also make an excellent series of cutting compounds and

deep cleaning polishes that can help with those occasional mishaps.  they also

make a dynamite leather preservative that i have found far superior to armoral. 

for chrome and metal i have found nothing that stands out;  they all seem to work

about the same.  on tires, i have found the notouch spray to be very good (never

use armoral on tires; it turns than purple!).  for glass, i found that windex

works really well.  one surprising find i have made is simple green.  this stuff

is a really good grease cutter for the engine and undercarriage.  it is also not

the end of the world should you get some on the paint although it will strip the

wax on contact.



these are the products i have found to work.  mind you, it may not win any parade

trophies, it dose keep my street machines nice and has placed well in the odd

street concours and wash 'n' shine.  a couple of parting tips:



 -always wash from the top to the bottom by hand

 -never apply any product directly to the car: always onto a application cloth (i

use hospital gauze; you can get it from drug stores).

 -don't over-wax; once every few months is sufficient

 -use good, soft polishing cloths and throw away those chemises!



hope i have been of help

Subject: 914 on the road!

I'm driving, I'm driving!  :)  I finally got my safety inspection last week,
and on Saturday I got my new plates -- "914-SWZ".  :)

The car shifts very well with the new bushings, and after the alignment, it
handles and steers beautifully.  I still have some work to do, but this is
Grrrrreat!  :)

Questions, though: 

  - Has anyone ever managed to fix a lazy seatbelt retractor spring?  My
    passenger side won't retract without a lot of cajoling, and I can't figure
    out how to add tension to the spring.

  - Can locks be rekeyed?  My driver's side door lock is a replacement (and
    thus has a different key).  I'd like to be able to use a single key...

  - How can I adjust the rear top latches?  The top doesn't clamp on quite 
    tight enough, causing some squeaking over bumps.  Nothing looks very
    adjustable, though.

Thanks...

Subject: More Gas


One more thought on Premium vs Regular gas in early 911's - 

With my yearly mileage (~ 5,000) the difference in cost
between Premium and Regular is under $100. Seems like
reasonable insurance to avoid detonation and to keep my
injectors cleaner.

One caviat is that the Porsche MFI manual says that if
customers are having trouble meeting emissions requirements
they may be using gas with too high an octane rating.
Higher octane means slower burning fuel - and what doesn't
get burned goes out the pipe.

dual plenum mass flow sensor set up (hot wire), which had the AutoAuthority

The version on display at Parade did not have the current version DME (old

Subject: "California Cars"


Howdy,

After sitting on the sidelines as a non-Porsche owning Porschephile,
I have decided to start shopping for a used 911. Right now the vin-
tage range that I am interested in fairly broad: basically something
made in the 1980s. I plan on tightening this up as I do more research
and shopping. Although my primary search area is Texas, I am also
considering California (my previous home) because I have many Porsche-
philic (?) contacts out there.

However, one (big) question I have with this is the issue of California
emissions. Up until the time I left, the state of California had much
stricter emissions standards than those enforced by the federal govern-
ment. In order to meet these standards manufacturers wound up creating
special "California" versions of their vehicles. These typically fell
into two categories: 1) a less powerful version that ran cleaner, or
2) similar power characteristics but with different hardware in the
engine. (An example I am particularly familiar with: in order to meet
emissions standards for the 1980 200SX, Nissan equiped California cars
with twin plug heads. Cars sold in the other 49 states had single plug
heads.)

My concern is that if I bought a California Porsche, I might have problems
either servicing "additional" hardware or have an asphyxiating engine when
it is not required legally.

Now my qustions:
What did Porsche do to meet California emission standards?
What sort of problems/difference does this present to me?
For the record, what do they do now?
Am I crazy to consider a car from California?
Am I crazy to want a Porsche in the waning days of dino-juice vehicles?

Advance thanks for your input.

Yes, and you can remove the cylinder fairly easily with hand tools and
jog over to the locksmithy. It's a fairly standard operation on any
Porsche. When you bring in the cylinder tell the locksmith it's from a
Beetle and he'll probably charge you less to do it.

SUBJECT: Repost of: For Sale: '84 Carrera Targa

Sorry to bother others on the list with this, but I inadvertently deleted the
note from the fellow in Dallas that was interested in a '85+ Targa or Cab.
Since we're not too far away from each other and this *is not* your garden
variety Carrera Targa (I know, it took a while for me to find it)....

We are reluctantly offering this car for sale:

1984 Carrera Targa, Platinum Metallic exterior, Mocha interior.  Car is
equipped with the following FACTORY options:

Color Matched Alloys
Full Leather Interior
Sport Seats
Headlight Washers
Sport Suspension
Limited Slip Differential
A/C
Alarm
Short Shift Lever
(Power Windows, antenna, mirrors and cruise control, etc. were standard equip.)

In addition, '86 Carrera sway bars were added, additional alarm system,
bra/cover, suspension lowered/aligned/balanced by 911 guru Dwight Mitchell,
H4 headlights, deep pile mats and sheepskin seat covers.

Car is in excellent condition with 67K miles on it.  We are the 2nd owners
and have all the maintenance records.  Clutch was replaced at 50K, Alternator
at 64K, brakes at 50K.  Mobil 1 oil changes every 5K.  First 64K miles were in
California.

The car has been autocrossed about 15 times in the past two years but never
has seen a high speed event.  Original owner bought it "because she liked the
color" and never drove it hard either.  It took me over 9 months to find this
car when I was looking, and will not be a disappointment to prospective buyers.

Price is negotiable at this point....

I used to slide a piece of plastic tubing (such as Tygon) over the end
of the hook which pulls down on the top. The selection of the wall
thickness determined the additional clamping force. This was somewhat of
a bother when removing and replacing the top, but I left the top on
most of the time. By the way. I never completely eliminated the squeaks,
but I did manage to significantly reduce the rate at which they occured.
I also seem to remember that some talcum powder on the rubber seal
would allow it to slip more easily, without a squeak.

I just returned from Monterey.  Sunday was lots of fun.  Those of us who
had signed up beforehand had been issued parking stickers for a special
Porsche corral in the infield at Laguna Seca.  Represented there were
just about every kind of 911 you could imagine from a '64 901 (number
20 off the production line!) to a couple of 959s, and about everything 
in between, including my modest '72 T.  I didn't count, but there must 
have been over 50 different 911 year/model combinations represented.  

Saturday was a day for hobnobbing with fellow enthusiasts and watching 
the races.  The special day was Sunday, when we were lined up roughly in
chronological order and led out onto the track.  They let us do three
laps, occasionally at something approaching speed, but mostly just
parading around.  The thrill for me was getting to drive through Laguna
Seca's famous corkscrew turn.  I'd always assumed that it must be
steeper than it looks from the spectator's point of view.  It is!  It's
sort of like driving off the edge of a cliff.  Great fun!

After the tour, we all adjourned to a tent where lunch and other
festivities were provided.  These included a toast to 911s with a
special champagne glass which we carried away afterwards, a few speeches
from PCNA reps and from other lumininaries including Hans Stuck and Mark
Donohue's son David, who were both there to drive the 917/30 Can-Am car.
Hans seems to be a real dyed-in-the-wool Porsche enthusiast.  All of
this, including the T-shirts commemorating "30 jahre 911" and the goody
bag we were provided, made it an event well worth attending.

If you've never been to Monterey during this weekend, it's a real car
lover's paradise.  Besides the races, there's a whole list of automotive
events.  There's a special Friday Italian Car concours, a series of
automotive displays and a big auction, and of course the big Pebble
Beach concours.  Try it next year; you'll like it, even if Porsche
doesn't have a featured place in the proceedings.

By the way, I found real value in the PCA magazine, Porsche Panorama,
during the trip.  I drove up from San Diego, and discovered halfway
there that my car wouldn't start.  It so happened that the August Pano
has an article on hot weather electrical gremlins; one of these was the
fact that, when 911s get hot like on a long trip, sometimes the solenoid
seizes up and the starter won't turn.  When it cools down, it operates
normally.  I was able to push-start whenever I had to shut it off on the
way up, and got to Monterey with no other problems.  Sure enough, a few
hours later in the cool and fog of Pacific Grove the car started just
fine.  I had no problems the rest of the stay.  On the way back, coming 
down I-5 in California's central valley, it happened again.  This 
morning it started right up again for me.  Anybody have words of wisdom
about a fix?  The Pano article talked about a replacement solenoid but
said many repair places will try to sell you the whole solenoid/starter
assembly when it may not be necessary.  On the other hand, the starter
probably has >200K miles on it.  Should I replace the whole assembly?

Subject: can I fix this rusty 914???



	
	Howdy all,

	I finally had a chance to pull a '73 2.0L 914 out from under
its cover this weekend and look under it.  I purchased this car back
in February with its brother, the 1.8L I have been working on.

	The rust under the car is pretty bad:

		Rear floorpan has major rust spots
		Front floorpan has some smaller spots
		Both inner rocker panels are gone (can see heater tube)
		Under car jack supports are gone
		Battery tray has holes
		(right rear fender looks okay)

	The question is:  Can I fix this myself?  I went through AA's
catalog last night and it looks like I need something like 1000 dollars
in sheet metal.  Given that I can probably get it cheaper elsewhere
(Stan has recommended Mill Supply - - does anyone else have some
recommendations??) that isn't THAT BAD.  I do know how to weld, and
I do have welding equipment, so the welding is okay.

	Do I need other more specialized equipment like jigs to support
the car while welding in the supports?  What else do I need?  A couple
of other porschephiles have posted reports of restoring their 914/911
I would love to hear about your experiences about doing it yourself or
hiring someone else to fix your rust problems.

	Should I contract a local shop to do the major welding?

	The other option I have is to find a rust free 914 and start
with that.  I believe that the one I have has matching numbers (and
is one of the last ones made for the 1973 model year) and I would like
to save it if possible.

	One other note about the car is that the exterior is in pretty
good shape with not major rust sports, etc.

	Thoughts, suggestions appreciated, Alex

Oh, yikes.  Sorry, I had thought that the 2.7 appeared at the same time as
CIS and the new-style bumpers.  The 2.7 (as I remember, but I'm about to shut

overheating problems, and you want to stay away from that.

Actually, these days, the SCs are cheaper.  The 1980-84 ones seem to be the
choicest, since they have more power.  Is the problem with the MIS 911s the
overhaul frequency, or are there other problems that I just didn't have with
mine (I didn't need to overhaul it, either, but I'm aware of the frequency
difference)?  I believe that insurance can be a LOT cheaper for the older
cars than for the SC.

I am thinking of getting a used 924 for about $2000-$3500
or a used 928 for about $6000-$7500.

1/ How long are porsche engines design to last (mileage wise,
year model around 78-84) ?
2/ What are the major differences (besides the body
type) between 924 and 928 ?
3/ What are the significant differences between 928 and 928s
4/ Any comment on insurance rate for these cars (two tickets, one
accident, 27 years old , male, southern california) ?
5/ What should I look out for in terms of repair ? 

If there were any old postings regarding my questions, could
someone forward them to me ?

Thank you very much and have a nice day.

Again, all the credit goes to Mike Weihman from HP, who was kind

hours (could be shortened), but I am very happy with the job and the
best part is that it is all original :-).

Thanks Mike!!!!!!!.

While I was at it I also cleaned out the windshield wiper motor
(the gear were jammed with dried windshield fluid residue),  now the
spray nozzle works just fine.

One thing I noticed is that my engine compartment light is not

Subject: 911 Longevity


Hi guys,

Just a few things to throw into the pot about how long a 911 could last.

My buddy, Larry Wong, wanted a 73 911, so we went looking in 1977 for
a likely candidate. We found a 911E Targa with 68K on the odometer which
wasn't operating. Larry and i serviced the car ourselves and it went to
189K before the valve guides said ENOUGH!

This isn't an isolated case for the early cars. Most hit 150K unless the
dreaded chain tensioner disease trashed the engine. The 1975 to 1977 
cars cooked themselves to death at 75K if you were lucky. The 78 and 
later returned to the 150K range, we see a lot of them out here in
*California* with very high mileage and in good mechanical order.

We are also seeing 944s in the 150K range. Seems like if you take care
of the essentials, they last.

Walt,
  At one time there were tech articles on the removal of 5 of the 10
ball bearings on the main shaft of the starter to help with this
problem.  Apparently the fit was so tight that removing half of the
bearings from the starter loosened things up enough to allow the 
solenoid to do it's job.  There was an article about this in the
San Diego region's news letter about two years ago (actually a reprint
from an article John Straub had in the news letter several years ago).

About a month ago, I posted about my Sunroof not operating properly.
I adjusted the micro switch and the Sunroof was fixed, except for
the fact that I am unable to take the Sunroof out, when the ignition
switch in the first position. 

I opened the whole Sunroof assembly in the rear of my 944. Tried
every possible thing, e.g. switch the relay and other connectivity
test but nothing happens when the ignition switch in the first
position. 

Since I hate going to the  dealer, I was looking for some help from
this group.

 - I want to know as to what type of noise (motor, relay,
   etc.) do you hear when the detach operation is performed
   and the ignition switch is set to the VERY FIRST position.

 - If it a relay noise, is it located in the Fuse box or is the
   one from the rear? 

 - I don't understand what are those switches on the back of the
   Sunroof motor assembly are (red with white buttons)?
 
 - Is there a relay in the fuse box control the Sunroof operation.

Pam Collopy, Pat Norris and Nabi Rafie, how are you doing with
your Sunroofs. Any new discoveries or helpful Hint!!!

Subject: Re: 911 Sticking Starter

Concerning 911 starter that doesn't work when hot:

My SC did this once driving across Utah in July (115 F), same symptom.
Back home I found the heat exchanger outlet hose routed so it touched
the solenoid.  This hose carries _hot_ air, whether the heater is on or
not.  Hot solenoid means high winding resistance means low force... even
WITHOUT worrying about what happens to the internal mechanical
tolerances at high temperatures.  Fix was simple (lucky me): move the
hose, AND glue a bit of foil-backed fiberglass insulation 'twixt it and
the solenoid.  Don't know if this will work in every case, though.

Hi folks!

I'm flying blind here (i.e. working without a schematic - is there going to be
one in the Haynes manual that I haven't gotten yet?). My battery kept going
dead.  Even with all of the fuses out (which has been its normal state for the
last couple of months during its resurrection). I stuck an ammeter on it --
250ma.  (letssee: 250 / Earth's diameter * the number of Star Trek episodes /
the amount of work accomplished by congress...no wait, ya can't divide by
zero...  / $3.22 in my bank account * 72...sure, that would drain my battery in
a few days!) I "discovered" that relays associated with the headlight motors
were energized when the headlights were up even when all of the fuses were out.
Is this right?

The power seems to come right from the + terminal of the battery. There are
three sets of wires connected to the main battery post clamp. Two sets are made
up of two wires and the other "set" is just one wire (this one runs to a relay
near the battery that I assume has something to do with starting).  All of the
wires are red. The two sets of two disappear into a sheath and head forward
under the battery.

1. Why would those relays be powered right off the battery (they can't be that
   important, can they)?

2. What's the other set of two wires for (I'd employ the smoke-test, but I'm
   probably going to have enough problems without creating new ones)?

3. With the headlights down I still get a current of about 2.5ma over the
   pair of relay wires...shouldn't that be 0?

Thank you for your support!

Affie, (and anyone else with 944 sunroofs)

Lubrication of the assembly helped tremendously.  We are still having
the ambient temperature problem, which leads me to the conclusion that
without the weatherstripping we are getting a tighter fit and more force
is required to move the sunroof.  And that the intended direction of force
is slightly off because the sunroof sets lower without the weatherstripping. 
Until weatherstripping gets to the top of the priority list our solution is 
to keep it closed to keep out dust, Escondido Village squirrels, roof rats,
and early preparation for the rain that is sure to come at an inconvenient 
time.  

Pat, are we going to have to gather these 944's together at some location

Subject: Warm Weather Starter Problems

    Walt-

    I experienced similar starter problems with my 1971 911.  After
    extended drives in hot muggy weather, or a few laps on the track,
    my starter was dead.  On cooler days, or on short trips, no
    starter trouble at all.  I was getting tired of idling the car
    while filling up for gas or parking on hills or having people help
    push me to get it started so I decided to fix it.  I did, however,
    opt for a less expensive fix than replacing the starter/selenoid
    unit.  I first replaced the transmission to chasis ground strap
    (around $6).  It seems that with age, and dirt, these straps
    corrode/deteriorate and increase resistance, hence increasing
    power to your starter, ecspecially when hot.  I then installed a
    starter relay (from Automotion for around $25).  I have since seen
    the same relay at Trak Auto for under $10 and don't believe that
    the instruction sheet and wire nuts from Automotion are worth the
    extra $15.  Let me know and I'll get the part number for the relay
    if you want.

    As far as effectiveness of my fix, I am not completly sure.  I do
    recognize a definite power increase when the starter
    turns over, but have not tested the car on any long drives on
    hot muggy days, or have had the car to the track since the
    update.  I'll let you know if you want.

    Best of luck-

Whenever this group starts talking about DMEs, a little voice in the
back of my head says "What a great project idea!"  Namely, disassembling
and reverse-engineering a DME.  When this happened in the spring, I was
able to silence it with reminders of the 5381 other projects that are
in process or pending.  Now that summer is on the wane, I'm thinking that,
shoot, 3265 of those projects will have to wait til next year anyway,
and there will surely be some cold, rainy evening(s) coming up that 
will be just right for DME exploration.  Since there seems to be a dearth
of public-domain information about DME internals, and since I've seen
no suggestions that the units are potted (otherwise, the PROM would be
inaccessible), I think it could be productive as well.

So, if you've got a broken DME, know where to get one (what's the core
charge on these units, anyway?), or even want to lend me a working one
in exchange for first (and free) dibs on the resulting information, let
me know.  My intent is, at minimum, to ascertain the type of interface
specifics that Kevin refers to above, and to get some idea about how the
different units (for the different car models) are configured (e.g. 
different PCBs, or same PCB but populated differently.  If they haven't
used ASICs, then getting a meaningful schematic is certainly possible.
Code dissasembly and analysis could follow...

Hi,

Can anyone help me... I'm trying to make 2 improvements to my UK '79 924.

1. Add an oil temp-guage
2. Update the ignition to TCIH ( from good old  contact breaker type ).

For the oil temp I belive that US had an oil-temp gauge fitted. (UK
have oil pressure on the left hand dial in the centre). There  appears
to be a bolt plugging a hole just above the oil drain plug on the oil
pan. I assume this is where the sender goes. (Am I correct?). If this
is so can someone tell me what the part number is (either Porsche or
VDO!). I already have obtained a matching VDO gauge to fit. I've seen
temp gauges on Audi's but haven't been able to crawl underneath one
yet!

For the Ignition, I have already obtained the amplifier, the coil and a
wiring loom, however I am having difficulty obtaining a hall effect
sender plate!.  I'm sure it's a standard Bosch part available on it
own, but getting a number out of Porsche is impossible! Can anyone help
me?

Failing that can someone at least give me the part number for TCIH type
distributor.  (I have numbers for the induction type and the contact
breaker type

477 905 206 for induction
047 905 205B for contact breaker.. 

so I guess it's 477 905 206 .... but what?

The Bosch part number would be useful as well!

Any help gratefully apreciated...

Maybe your adjustment to the microswitch has the car thinking the roof is

  Seeing the 917-30 at Laguna Seca was especially significant for me, since
the October 1973 Can-Am race at Laguna Seca was the *first* race I had ever
attended. The sights and sounds of this machine were etched forever into
my mind - even at the very young age of 7! 

  The sight (and sound) of this wonderful car idling and revving-up in the
paddock was awesome! It had a very strong, urgent sound to it; just imagine
the sound of the biggest 911 (race) motor turned-up a few notches, with
the turbo also giving it a distinctive sound.

  According to some people milling about, the crew maintaining the 917-30 
saw some fuel-pickup problems earlier in the week. The car appeared
to run just fine during the practice session, the exhibition laps at 
lunch time, and the last race of the day for the 1966-'73 Can-Am cars.
David Donohue did about 5 exhibition laps during the lunch hour, and
Hans Stuck was in the driver's seat during the 10-lap race in the after-
noon. Stuck mentioned that his lap times at Weissach were less than a 
second slower than the 962 lap time - not bad for a 20 year old car running
on 15-inch tires (and 1970's tire technology)! I thoroughly enjoyed the
sight of this machine on the track; it served as reminder to me that (IMHO)
there will never again be anything like the Porsche 917.

Hey Everyone,

I am considering buying a 1970 911T Targa to use as a project car.  The
car has a little rust and is missing some small parts (one front seat,
headlight trim, etc).  The car has been stored for about ten years and the 
engine has not been turned over for this same time.  He wants $4000.00.

Is this a good deal?  This will be my first porsche, so I am a rookie when
it comes to evaluating how much money and time it will take to restore.

Thanks for any input

So what you are saying is that we first need to drive up skyline, down to

Or should we pick someones garage, so we can have stan Fiddle with those
hard to fix problems. For every fix, He gets a beer. :-)

We could also drive to St Stan's in Modesto. Or the Micro Brew in Hollister
I think it is San Andreas Brew pub. 


Since Stan is the Guest, we should point out what food they have
available too. Like the Cajun catfish at Tied house. Yum Yum.

If we go to GB in PA, then we could walk over to DM motors and look at all the
sick cars. :-( 

BTW for the person who asked about adjusting the rear roof clamp. You can
replace the hook part for cheap. Call mid engine mainia at 800 321 5432
and buy a used hook with out spring. Then just move spring to new part.
When I replaced mine I noticed a different size width of the bracket that
the hook sits on. So I just swapped hooks. You will need a size 10 offset
wrench to make the job easy.

Here my intrepretion of this note

  Stan is leaving for the SF bay area on Tuesday Aug 24.

  His schedule has these times available:

     Wednesday evening Aug 25 -- free
     Friday evening Aug 27 -- possibly free 

  Maybe the "Malibu trip" refers to the Malibu Gran Prix amusement
  park, where customers drive scaled down race cars at scaled down speeds,
  on highway 101 near Redwood City?

  Does it still exist?

Anyway, here is a second vote for a movement of the dinner location 
more toward San Francisco.  It's less of a hike for at least one of
us living 60 miles north of the Golden Gate bridge.  Wednesday
is probably out for me, Friday is better.

You simply call your VDO distributor, and tell him/her that you need
an oil temp sender with such-and-such a thread size.  They have them
in sizes from 10 mm. through the low 20's.  If there is a blind plug
in the pan, as you suggest, the fiche will list its dimensions.  In my

So the engine is pretty much guaranteed to be junk.  Depending on the
level to which you care to restore the "small parts," you are also looking
at a pretty long bill in that department as well.  That missing seat will
not seem a "small part" when you price its replacement.  The trim pieces
will kill you as well.  You are also probably in for some rude suprises in
the rust department.

I think the price is absurd.  You can own a good-running, solid but
not drop-dead-beautiful '70 for a couple of grand more than this guy's
asking.  Don't start your Porsche ownership experience with anything you
cannot immediately drive.

Subject: 914: Water drainage and trunk holes

Me again,

To either side of the engine compartment lid there are stationary body panels
that match the lid (solid panel followed by the "diamond" grill). The lid
itself collects any water that falls on it and drains it away. The two side
pieces don't. Should they? I mean any water being sprayed on the right one ends
up on the top of the battery. (No wonder these cars wear out so fast! 8-) It
looks like if there were some sort of rubber cover on the bottom side it would
still allow the trunk lid "elbows" to poke up into the holes (when the trunk is
open) while making water drain down the channel between the exposed part of the
fenders and the outboard side of the trunk main weather strip.

It seems that I'm not alone in my quest for a replacement piece of body to fill
the hole left by removing the air conditioning system from a 914. Now I can't
find it in the archives but I thought that someone said there was a place (on
the coast?) where they had a bunch of rusted 914's they were using for parts
(someone call the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Porsches!).  Does
this part of the car rust much (mine doesn't collect much water 8-). And would
there be a chance a "rusted" one having a good front luggage compartment floor.

Thanks a heap!

Subject: Brake Bleeing

    Greetings-

    Like a lot of members of this group, I try to bleed my brakes
    regularly.  I've tried the vacuum type bleeder (Mity-Vac),
    but find that the old stand by method of pedal pumping more
    efficient and more thorough.  I was wondering if anyone has tried
    any other method and has found it to be a one person, thorough job
    (I know someone who simply cracks open all the bleeder screws and
    lets gravity do the work).

    Also, has anyone tried the Eezi-Bleeder?  The system sounds
    interesting- its a pint bottle that you fill with brake fluid,
    attach via a tube to a special tapped cap for your brake fluid
    reservoir and then presurize off of your spare tire.  Does anyone
    know if this system is any good?  Is it better than Mity-Vac with
    the quality of the job it does?  Is it as good as having someone
    sit in the car and pump the pedal while you crack each bleeder?

    Comments are appreciated.  Thanks.

Hi,

I have tried Mity-Vac with the same result - still air in the system.

I was then recommended to apply pressure to the brake fluid reservoar.
I'm therefore right now "building" something that might work for one
person (I wasn,t aware of Eezi-Bleeder):

1. I got a cap for the brake fluid reservoar for free (!) at the
junk yard. Almost any german car will fit.

2. Where tyres are sold you can get a regular valve for a wheel.

3. A suitable hole is drilled in the cap and the valve is attached.

4. As the spare tyre is de-pressurized on a 911 is my intension
to get a cheap ressure regulator ($12-13) and use the original
pump (electric).

The drawback with thsi design is that you will have to stop
and fill the reservoar up a couple of times. It would therefore
be interesting to see an Eezi-Bleeder before I build mine.

I will get back about the results when I've built and tried it...or
have anyone already tried this??

Sigh.  Yes, let's not make a big *DEAL* out of it, OK???? :-)

I can tell you what happens when a '69 911S hits a mountain at 85MPH
and a burm and signpost at about 65 and the mountain again at about 40. . .

Okay, so I was driving through a canyon road when the street (right before
a tight left) went suddenly about 5 inches off-camber and...yikes, understeer,
crunch.  At this point, the car went sideways across the road, smacked the
sign post (put a huge dent in the outside of the door -- destroyed the handle),
bounced off the burm (thank God, the drop would have been a doozie), deja vu
sideways across the road, crunch number 3, back to the road, then spin to a
stop.

The outside of the car was pretty crunched-up, but the interior was pristine.
Even where I flattened the sign post, the inside of the door was clean.  This
helped me understand the integrity of the car (and that I should give a buck
or two to Skip Barber before I try something like that again -- this time, on
a track).

So, about two weeks ago, at low speeds (traffic), I start hearing a squeal 
from my rear brakes. It was annoying, but I couldn't check it out for another
three days or so. At first I thought it was merely disc noise and I could 
remedy it with some spray junk. Then I decided that I should service the 
brakes before winter so that it was another check off my checklist.

When I took the rear wheels off, there was the start of a nasty scoring on the
driver's side rotor. When I inspected the pad, there was a piece of gravel that
had somehow wedged itself in the pad! If I'd checked the sqeal sooner, I 
wouldn't have that groove on my rotor. Luckily it's very slight, but still...

Just FYI - take notice of those new noises and investigate promptly.

What PSI are you using?

I run mine of a junk spare wheel with only  4-5 psi .... any higher and
you risk putting air into the system! Any old spare will do.... so long as
it holds air to 5psi for 20mins. The fluid comes out slightly slower than
it does if you do the 2 man pumping type bleeding.

The bottle holds enough to bleed each of the long lines..once..

I also use one  of the one way valve type tubes on the nipple (to be
doubly sure ). They're inexpensive and provide a small amout of
back pressure to ensure that the air is forced out.

The other thing I find good with the one way valve is that you can 
pump the pedal once or twice to get the dead fluid from there as
well!

Subject: 914 console question


 I used to belong to the 914 Owner's Association and am looking
 for their phone number. If anyone has it could you pass it along?

 The question I have re consoles is: there was a 914 center seat
 console advertised in the 914 O.A. newsletter. It sold for about
 $100 and allowed you a good deal of storage space between the
 passenger and driver's seats. It was raised up so that you could
 rest your arm on it (always a flaw with the 914 design). Does 
 anyone know the supplier and current address for this?

 many thanks,
 Stefan

I know there's some jokers out there that sell mechanically unsound cars in this price range ($4000). I have a different story.

I'd been looking for a looker 68-71 911 in the under 10K range. After looking
for months, and looking at some real wieners, I saw a for sale sign on a 
street side 68. I looked at it in the parking lot nad immediately had the
'had to have' feeling. 

The body/interior was in top shape. The motor had 52K original (!!!) miles, and
purred like a kitten. The body rust damage was very minimal (normal bottom of
fender wells, windsheild) bubbling under 1/8th in. There seemed to be no 
undercarriage rust at all. The fine misting of black overspray should have
warned me. I thought this was a fine piece and terribly underpriced.

About a month after purchase, I saw the character I purchased from in traffic. 
He seemed to be having a good laugh at my expense. It was disturbing. I 
immediately started looking for some indication of a major problem. The major
clue was that the tow hook was mysteriously missing.

I know I'd checked the 17 rust areas listed in the DIY book ( a must read for 
first time purchasers). After a few more days there was a strange click coming
from the front end. When I jacked the car up, there it was. The gaping hole in
the suspension pan. The suspension was hanging on to this itsy piece of rusted
metal, and was hanging down about three inches in mid-air.

The first quote on inlaying a new front-half suspension pan was $2200 labor!
This broke my widdoe heart. I figured buying a tig welder and doing it at home
was the plan of attack. Working weekends and nights, I had the piece inlaid in
two weeks.

Having the car raised allowed me to see how the rest of the 
undercarriage faired. It was truly immaculate, one indication that the 100K 
mark had not been reached.

Now I feel as though I have a car worth 10K more and newer than when I bought
it. 

I just want to mention this jokers repair/concealment job on the suspension
pan. He's gooped as much bondo as was possible into the holes, sanded it down
and painted/undercoated the area. I figure he got the car cheap from the first
owner (a friend of his parents). Refused to sell the car with the upkeep papers
because they would reflect the problem. I also found sticks stuck in the holes
to add 'strength'. It was a piece of work. He refused to give me a break on the
bill of sale because he was a San Jose Police Force hopeful and didn't want that to come back and bite him! What an a**hole! I'd warn others by releasing his
name but I'm above backstabbing.

First time buyers - get the Do It Yourself repair guide. There's a list of the
rust areas to inspect. This was - of course - one of the main areas, under the
battery box.

Hello there fellow porschephiles, I have a couple of questions for you.

 - How do I tell if a 935 is a DP original? Is the original DP body
  parts are fiberglass or kevlar? How do I tell if it is kevlar?

 - A local Porsche dealer has a 935 that he claims is a DP original. The
  the car was purchased new as a 79 930, DP converted it (new) to
  a 935 and retitle it as an 1980 car. The car has about 100K miles and
  is in great condition mechanically and cosmetically. If it's really
  is a DP original then how much do you think it worth? If it's not then
  how much? Any idea at all are much appreciated.

 - Same sort of questions, however the branch is Gemballa. Are Gemballa
  body parts fiberglass or steel?

 - Any idea on the value of a Gemballa Avalanche based on an 80-SC?

Hello Porsche junkies,

I have some 356 questions.  First, what is the current price range in California
for a '55-'59 356 1600 Normal Coupe?  Also, where can I get a pair of those
leather straps I've seen installed over the the luggae compartments on 356's?

My experience at the Monterey Historics was awesome!  I came away with a 
program autographed by Hans Stuck, right after his win.  I also have some great
video footage of the races on Sunday, complete with the sound of the 917/30
blasting past me.  Does anyone know what happened to the Shadow?  This car 
apparently placed second, during the trial runs, but for some reason was not
in the race against the 917.  Hmm... 

Did any of you see the hilarious Spa-ster.  These guys were selling a replica
of a '57 Speedster which was converted into a jacuzzi.  The pump was installed
in the luggage compartment and under the engine lid was an ice bin for Champagne
Too much!  I wonder if they sold any.

I use a technique which involves pressurizing the air over the fluid
in the master cylinder. I have described the technique here before,
but it has been several years, so it may be worth repeating.

I have a spare master cylinder reservoir cap, to which I have added
a tire valve. The cap I use fitted my old 914, and fits my current
944S. I don't know if the same cap fits 911, 928, etc., but it sounds
likely. The tire valve I added is a metal one with rubber gaskets,
intended for aluminum wheels, which I got at a local speed shop.
I also got a air chuck which latches onto the tire valve. The more
typical application is for applying air while seating the bead on
tubeless tires. To use the bleeder, I set my compressor to 15-20 PSI,
and connect the compressor hose to the top of the master cylinder
with the above special cap and air chuck. This of course pressurizes
all of the brake fluid at the same 15-20 PSI. I then simply bleed each
wheel with the standard piece of tubing and a can. Bleeding proceeds
quickly enough that you need to be careful not to drain the master
cylinder of fluid. The above mentioned rig with a separate fluid
container would help in that regard, but with added complexity.
One of the reasons I haven't bothered with it is that I don't want
to throw away a lot of new brake fluid, but I also don't want to keep
it around until the next time, due to its hydroscopic nature.
Also, don't forget to reduce the compressor pressure. Full pressure
will distribute brake fluid in a lot of places you don't want it.
If you don't have a compressor, the spare tire approach, or the
air tanks frequently made from old Freon bottles are a reasonable
alternative. If you use an air tank filled at the local gas station, 
you will presumably want some type of a regulator to limit the pressure.
Typical spare tire pressures (30 PSI or less) are probably reasonable.
There is virtually no air flow other than leaks, so you don't need
anything very fancy.

I made my annual trip to the Monterey Historics with a buddy who has
a '72 P****** 911T.  The drive up was moderately interesting, as
older P-cars are suceptable to electrical problems when overly warm.
We ended up bump-starting on the road, and I need a lot of pee
breaks at my advanced age.  McDonalds has replaced the gas station
as the recommended stop point.

Anyways, the featured marque was, um, Steve Earle having his own
20th anniversary celebration with a few (very nice) Millers thrown
in for Saturday lunch time laps.  However, on Sunday, in honor of
the 30th anniversary of the 911, P-cars got to put in 3 laps of
Laguna Seca.  To put an Alfa slant on things, I found hanging around
P****** club people far inferior to Alfa gatherings.  I have always
felt Alfa folk were down-to-earth, friendly, etc.  P-folk may be
friendly, but with an undercurrent that the world revolves around
their cars and the large injections of money needed to keep them
going.  Maybe I'm generalizing a little, and hope there aren't too
many P-fans out there that will jump me.  Actually, I'd be happy to
be corrected.  Expense was spared on the 30th ann. lunch P******NA
put on: all the hot dogs & hamburgers they could cram in the steam
tables.

I found Laguna Seca on Sunday to be another world from Saturday.  I
guess I had never been on Sunday before.  I usually go Friday, when
its totally deserted, and Saturday, which is a mob scene.  Sunday
was a lot closer to Friday than Saturday.  Almost no car clubs, and
greatly reduced traffic.

Concours Italilia, as someone already mentioned was exquisite.  None
of the overrestored machines that you see at Pebble Beach.  The only
down side was the lack of motos.  Although there was supposed to be
more than last year, in fact, only 6 bikes were shown, and two of
them were H-D Areomaccis (sp).

Hello fellow porschephiles


I am restoring an engine for my '58 356,and would appreciate some feedback.

Brief decription:

58-60 engine case,no thermostatic valve,case matching numbers are
identical on all three pieces.

The engine has the 502 rods :-(,it has a .103 (normal) camshaft.
Crank,rods & camshaft are very good.

The heads are C spec heads with the 30 degree angle,61cc,34&38mm valves.

Piston & cylinders are also of C spec.

Carburettors (32NDIX) and manifolds are of C specs.

So,this is a late A engine case  with C stuff mounted.


What I want is a reliable engine,buillt to 75 HP standard.
So,...should I stick to this combination?
Or at least get a 'super' camshaft?
How much HP will one get with a 'normal' camshaft and C heads and P/C's?
Mileage and reliability are my main concerns on this one.

Anyone interested in trading an original BR9 for a 031 distributor????

Re: brake bleeding.

I recommend the Snap-On pressure bleeder...costs around $150 and
worth it.  You modify an extra master cylinder cap to take the male
fitting.  Don't pressurize above about 10lbs on the guage.  No need
to refill your master cylinder, the bleeder holds plenty of brake
fluid.  I usually put in about 3 or 4 cans, pressurize (hand pump),
then go around the car opening bleeders one by one.  No real
problems, gets all the air and old brake fluid out easily.  However,
if you are not racing or doing track events, ye old two person
method is a bit more cost effective.

You know it's illegal to knowingly sell a car with a defect like that without

I had a similar experience with a 914.  The car had a nice paint job, everything
looked really good, even the the battery tray.  2 months later the right rear
suspension caved in - the guy had tacked a piece of metal onto the
suspension support, just enough to keep it working until he sold it.  I
approached the guy with this, and he was more than happy to pay me $800 for
the repair in return for signing a paper saying I wouldn't sue him.

Heh, that's why the used car dealers make you sign a form saying you accept the
car "as is".

PS I hope you didn't use a Tweeks sheet metal replacement to repair your
suspension pan.  My 911S came with the pan freshly repaired, and a year later
the front torsion bar mount ripped itself out of the pan.  Now it's a mess of
welding, but it's held for 2 years.  I intent to redo the repair with a high

I use basically the same method, with one difference.  Instead of  
using an air compressor, I use a small hand-held bike pump.  This  
gives you fine control over the pressure and is easy to carry with  
you to the track.  I got the idea from Gary Edwards.

The cap should fit most Porsche models (except the 356?), but for the  
911 you need to plug the reservoir breather hose or you'll pump fluid  
all over the floor.

Subject: 914: Can we say 'hiss'?

Hi all (except those drinkin' beers in SF),

Just forward of the oil filler, hmmm, opening(?) (I'm still working without any
documentation -- but that should be fixed here in a week or so) there is a
cloth covered hose that comes out of the engine and then just snakes back down
toward the ground with the other end not attached to anything. Is that OK?

I was poking around the engine compartment last night in prep for actually
having the rest of the car ready to get back on the road (boy it's gonna look
good!). I've had a standing joke with myself that one good speed bump and a
couple of the vacuum lines were going to pop right off. So I was in there to
take care of those few items. After I stared at things for a few minutes it
came to me that probably 3/4 of the vacuum lines were going to be popping off
when I hit that speed bump! There are hardly any hose clamps on the ends! And
while the hoses look OK the ends on some of them are a bit...enlarged shall we
say...and they don't fit very tight. So it's off to the parts place today to
pick up some hose clamps (the kind that don't dig into the hoses) and plug
them leaks. It's amazing the car ran at all.

Now the Big (Evans & Novak) Question: should any type of goop be put on the
inside of the hoses to help them seal? Some of them attach to plastic nipples
and I don't want to have tighten the hose clamp too tight and break something.

Thank you very much.

Subject: Brake Bleeding- Cont.

    Magnus-

    I commend you on your ingenuity in builidng your own bleeder.
    Perhaps you can overcome the drawback of having to re-fill the
    reservoir by taking a lesson from Eezi-bleeder.  Instead of
    directly pressurizing the reservoir, use a bottle (such as a one
    pint brake fluid bottle) and tap the cap twice.  Once hole can be
    for your pressure, and the other can be a feed line going to your
    already tapped duplicate reservoir cap (I assume the feed line for
    the fluid that goes from the pint bottle to the reservoir will
    have to extend all the way to the bottom of the bottle to "pick
    up" the fluid).

    I think Scott Jessen had an excellent point re using only filtered
    air.  I don't know about where you are, but here in Washington,
    DC, it seems that about half of what comes out of the end of my
    compressor hose is water!  Perhaps a small inline filter built
    into the system will help keep the air dry, and clean.  From what
    I have seen, the Eezi-bleeder has not addressed Scott's
    filtered air concern, and just because you might be using a spare
    tire and not a compressor, I don't think that solves the moisture
    problem or the dirt problem - I know some inner tubes have a
    powder in them and I suspect tires to have dirt and dust as well).

    As yet another option, I have been considering applying the vacuum
    concept on a different level than the Mity-Vac.  I have been
    thinking about taking a syphon gun (the type used to spray
    undercoating) and attaching a tube from the bleeder screw to the
    syphon pickup.  I assume it would then just be a matter of craking
    the bleeder screw and "spraying" the fluid out of the gun.  A tube
    at the end of the gun to keep the fluid going into a waste bin
    instead of all over the car would be a good idea!  Also, I suspect
    pressure regulation might take a little adjusting to figure out
    the right suction.  What do you think?  I haven't tried it yet but
    will let you know if I do.

    Please keep me posted on the progress of building your bleeder.

How about some opinions (real life experience would be nice) on the above

I've done a bit of questioning to my circle of Porsche racers and wannabe
racers, and most are using or have heard more positive things about the Quaife
especially in AX type of use. Most agree that, as long as the power is kept on,
both work similarly on the track.  The Quiafe "opens" when unloaded, or acts
more like an open differential when power is off. Thus it can be more versatile
in slower speed but quick turn maneuvers like in an AX.  Since the ZF limited
slip is always "on" or transferring whatever percent power it's set up for (add
or subtract friction disks), it causes understeer or "push" in that same type
of use.

I've just put a Quaife in my 915 box and don't have the car back together
yet.  I have had a bunch of time with the ZF LSD and like it for sweepers
or track use.

I guess I'm suffering from the anticipation blues...

Folks,

A while back, I heard about a collection of CanAm cars and other classics
in DE, somewhere near Frankfurt.

Does anybody know the name and location of this place?

I'll be in DE from 7-Sep thru 5-Oct and am looking for Porsche things to do/see.

If you can recommend other sights/events and things to try, please let me
know.  I'll be staying near Munich, Nurnburg, and Frankfurt at different
times through the month.  The Oktoberfest will absorb some of my time in
the later part of October.

Thanks,
Larry

Subject: Monterey Races

Folks,

I was at Monterey for 1/2 of Saturday.  Saw all the practice sessions
and the Millers at noon, as well as the Porsche Can-am car!  Didn't
see the races though.

When I got there in the morning and walked around the paddock (nothing
is roped off.  You can stand there and drool--hopefully on yourself and
not on the cars--as the owners are there getting ready to race) the
Allards all happened to be firing up.  Yikes what a racket.  What a
beautiful sound, and man did they REV those things.  I stood at a
corner where most of the cars had to pass on their way to the track.  I
was there with about 30 other people who were more or less in the way
as the Allards slowly tried to get through us (since nothing was roped
off--after all).  Sooner or later we figured out how to stand close yet
be out of the way and the georgeous machines threaded through
us--engines reving and clutches slipping.  If you've never seen
anything like this you should.  I had to choke down a lump in my throat
and had essence of tears in my eyes as I watched.  The bright chrome
and paint, outrageously loud and powerfull engines, and the car owners
who do this for the pure love of it is incredible to see and experience.

It was amazing to see this group go out and run as it was the '47-55 SPorts
Racing Car >2.0 liter class.  This means you have your Allards out there
with various Jag C types, a  56 Maserati A6G2000 (a lovely Italian Coupe
looking like a normal car amoung the Allards) , a thing called a 1948 Darwin
Beetle, which I have never seen before but looks a lot like a 32 Ford coupe
complete with headlight bar, a lovely 53 Pegazo Z102 BS which looks like
a curvy Fiat 124 Spyder on steriods, etc.  In this day of similar looking
race cars it was great to see such a variety all out there going for it.

Especially since you had your monster V8 Allards creating all manner of
noise and mayhem, right with your Jag C types which sound incredibly
refined along with your 2.O liter Italian coupes which sounded totally
differen--kind of scrappy and persistant.  I was happy to note that a
lot of the people around me were equally drawn to the whole sound issue
as the thing that made the event come alive.  Not so much the volume of
sound as the different types--all together at the same time.

The next group was the 55-59 >2.0 liter class and it had your basic Ferrari's
out there with a 56 corvette which had this huge teardrop THING on the
back, only to be outdone in this department by a 57 TBird.  What could
be more poetic than Ferrari's racing against American V8's?  Well, a lot
of things, actually but it was cool.

Speaking of cool, earlier there was the 47-55 <2.0 liter which featured
a 55 356 which was very loud and fast, and a 49 356SL (a speedster with
a tiny bump on the dash vaguely resembling a windscreen) which was also
fast.  There was also a Cooper-Porsche (yes, the very Pooper mentioned
last month on the net) actually it was announced as "one of the East Coast
Poopers" so it was not the very same seen in Seattle, but one of the few
in existance.

I was amazed at how hard some of these guys were willing to run in these
cars--even in practice sessions.  I stood by turn 4 and saw a lot of 
great late breaking and dicey moments.

I also saw the FI cars practice.  I've heard Indy cars before and they sound
as though someone ripped a crack straight through the earth and let some
of Hell's shrieking demons emote for a while.  The F1 cars were very similar
if not even more shrill.  When they go by, your body gets a permanent
adrenaline buzz that is better than sex or drugs--at least for awhile ;^) 

Which of the F1 cars actually won the race, anyone who was there?????

The 81 Williams was a monster.  But there were a couple of mid 70's 
John Player Secials that could have been competitive that were at least
driven well in practice if not fast enough to spar with the Williams.

And so on.

Didn't get to hear the Can-Am cars (except the Porsche!).  Some other
day I hope.

Subject: Magazine subscriptions


	Living on this side of the pond makes it somewhat difficult to
subscribe to US car magazines, as the extra cost of postage and
(when they don't accept credit cards) obtaining a cheque in $US can
make it quite expensive.

	Last year I subscribed to _Road and Track_ under their "new
subscriber" special offer (about $10 off if I remember correctly)
and have been reasonably impressed with their coverage of Porsche
matters in general. My subscription is shortly coming up for renewal
and is it quite a bit more expensive than I originally paid. So
(finally getting around to the question!), can anyone tell me what
_Road and Track_'s marketing policy is - can I let my subscription
lapse and then take out another "new subscriber" offer, or will they
offer me cheaper copies as it gets closer to the subscription
deadline?

	Supplementary question : Are there any other US (or any other
foreign) car magazines worth subscribing to for their Porsche
coverage? I have just subscribed to _Excellence_ (and am waiting for
the first issue to arrive), but wonder about _Car and Driver_,
_Christophorus_, etc. Do any of these take plastic?

Yes this message was forwarded by me,I found it interesting and decided
I would inform you.I thought perhaps someone could give him a tip on the
problems with his buddy's warm start problems,and also assure him that most
Porsche-people are down-to-earth people.

And what if it wasn't?Is there a need to pin down every statement
one think could be insulting?Shouldn't one be very careful not to fall in
the same hole?



Where does that leave us??

1) This guy Hervey has a buddy that needs help with his 911.

   We just had a discussion on this topic.....eh?

2) It is intersting to know what other-car people think of

Philip,

Regarding magazine subscription I'm convinced that Cristophorous
take plastic (DM42/$28,50 year). It's a quite nice magazine and
you can get a free sample issue and subscription issue if ypo write
to Porsche AG, Editors Cristophorus, Postfach 40 06 40, D-7000
STUTTGART 40, fax (D-711)827-6245. They also had a special 30 year
anniversary issue which was worth reading!

And I hope that you have discovered "911 and Porsche world"
which is an English (UK) magazine. This is actually the magazine
that I like the most.

Excellence is also OK but it took very long time before the first
issue came.

Two hammers and a wire hanger? Wait a minute, that describes my tool

Yes, I too am a disciple of the Muir Zen approach to auto repair,
having gone through college with a '71 Beetle and that handy tome and a
roll of duct tape to keep the floor together. 

But now that we drive Porsches we find ourselves at a different level.
It doesn't look quite as good to be stuck on the side of the road with
your 911, although I still do it occasionally, as passer-by motorists
scoff and comment to their partner, "He obviously works on that car
himself", actually I'm just too cheap to call a tow. 

Now, where was that wire hangar?...

PS: I just can't picture a glossy $4.95 magazine called
"Skinned-Knuckles, the DIY magazine for Porsche owners" featuring
articles like "The $99 911 weekend valve job" or "Replacing 944 torque
tube bearings using your bathtub and freezer".

A couple of the UK non-Porsche mags such as "Classics..." etc talk you thru some
of the more generic jobs and point out the pit falls doing the job on any car...

They've even covered buying 911's / 356's recently, but Excellence seems to be

Yep.... I agree John Muir's book taught me the real "how to get ... " done! The factory/Haynes

AH, the musings of Summer.

There's always been the controversy about the relative family ancestry 
of most Porsche owners by those who abuse the priviledge of operating
the motor vehicle. Those other parties have settled the discussion of
their ancestry by their choice of motor vehicle.

It was pointed out in a doctorial thesis that Porsche ownership or the 
desire to own one was in itself the core of a religion. This was in the 
late sixties, a time when Herb Caen, the famous SF Chronicle columnist,
noted that the average Porsche Driver was the biggest hazard to crossing
streets in said city.

Note I make the distinction between OPERATING and DRIVING, the highways
are full of the barely conscious acting as a rolling obsticle course 
for the **TRUE BELIEVERS***. One conservative organization complained
that the autocross series was designed to turn out more highway 
stormtroopers to terroize the populace. Actually, it was conceived to 
protect us from the incompetance of the usual driver.

Nevertheless, owners of other marques are aggrivated when they see a 
column of Porsches roar past, on their way to somewhere as they sit
with their crumpets on the side of the road. Face it, most of the other
Marques have to have social events, the damn things are too much of a
comprimise for long tours of normal driving. When was the last time a 
Lotus club seen on a tour? They usually gather and talk about when the
damn thing might get put back together ( A small example).

There are some marques, notably Asian, that could hardly qualify for
a group to be be fans. Subaru, Isuzu, Suzuki, Hyundai, Dai Woo, etc.
The thing that disturbs the Morgan Club, BMW Club, etc. is that the 
Porsche owner wants to do IT. Go to the track and prove they can do it,
get out there and see if they make the grade. Drive the Porsche of
Choice and get the thrill.

I went out with a woman years ago that decided to look in the garage 
after a pleasant evening. She remarked "You've got two of those??"
Her demeanor changed in a split second as she explained that every man 
she'd met with only one of those was an a******. I smiled and informed 
her that after she DROVE one she would feel differently about it. She 
took up the offer. We've been married eleven years after disposing of
her Lotus oil leak.

As Porsche owners, we can take two tacts, MAKE every prospective motor 
vehicle operator drive one so they know what it is, or, tighten up the 
requirements and keep it to ourselves selfishly. I vote for the latter,
as most people shouldn't be NEAR a Porsche, let alone own one.

Power To The Porsche (Owner)!!!!

If you think this is radical in writing, I have stronger feelings in
person.

Tom,

No problem with disconnecting battery for storage.  Just re-program
your clock and radio next spring.  Remove your battery completely from
the car and set it on a block of wood.  This maximizes your chance of
having a usable battery next spring and minimizes your chance of battery
acid damage to your car.  Also, if your storage area might drop below 
freezing, then drain the winshield washer fluid out of the lines from
the resovoir to the squirters.  The small amount of fluid in the lines
is very susceptible to freezing, even with de-icer added to the fluid.

I find the use of the word "restoring" amusing when used with the

My policy is this
 
I have the original case for my car, packed away in cosmoline. And to
go with that, I have started assembling the correct parts to go with
it. When I have them, it will go together as a 100% correct 63 SC
engine. 

In the meantime, I have built a second engine on a 912 case, with NPR
big-bore, Stoddard sport cam (another sad passage into the NLA world)
Webers, and a Thunderbird stinger exhaust (also NLA). Makes about 120 HP
and is fun as hell to drive.

One is original, and has a planned use as "concours

One is NOT, and is used all the time (now) and will eventually move
into another (substantially less original than my current car) vehicle.

If you want a "fun" engine, your plan sounds good. If you want a restored
engine, ummm... well, you know the rest.

There are advantages and disadvantages to belonging to the worlds largest
sports car club. A major advantage is that you can almost always find
someone of like mind to discuss life, cars and who knows what. A major
disadvantage is that sometimes you may have to get off you dead ass
and do a little looking those of like mind.  If you just like to hang
out with people who drive Porsches, then socials are a great source
to start with.  If you think the world revolves around your dirty
fingernails, then you better start looking into competition activities.
By the way, watching others race is not a competition activity. At
something like this you will encounter mostly car-polishers, not dirty
fingernail types. 

If you want PCA to continue to harbor a wide diversity of people then
I suggest you keep up constant barrage to PCA/PCNA for creating
more affordable cars.  It is a point of some pride to me that because
of PCA, I know many wonderful people. Some paupers and some millionaires.
Car-polishers and dirty fingernail folks are in each category.

Oh yes, there are assholes in each category as well.

Subject: Porsche 959 (price?)


Hi there,

I was reading an old article (Road & Track '88 or '89)
on the 959 written by Paul Frere. In it, he was rendering a
dramatization of  the acceleration power of the 959 by saying that
if the 959 was at a stand still and another car passed it 
with the cruise control set at 100 mph, then it could catch 
up that car and overtake it within 1 kilometer (0.6 miles).
(That is, the acceleration of 0 to 60 of 3.6 sec. represents
an average speed of 102.7 mph on the first kilometer.)
This remark and many others made me fall in love with the car.
Now, how much is that car in the second hand market??
(Less than 1000000$ I presume...). I am not rich but I 
always prefer to know what exactly it is that I am dreaming about!

Tom,

No problem with disconnecting battery for storage.  Just re-program
your clock and radio next spring.  Remove your battery completely from
the car and set it on a block of wood.  This maximizes your chance of
having a usable battery next spring and minimizes your chance of battery
acid damage to your car.  Also, if your storage area might drop below
freezing, then drain the winshield washer fluid out of the lines from
the resovoir to the squirters.  The small amount of fluid in the lines
is very susceptible to freezing, even with de-icer added to the fluid.

Agreed.  I'm disappointed with the local PCA, a group more interested in

the clock

I've had perfect luck disconnecting the battery (bring it indoors) and 
just wiggling the car periodically to keep the tires round.  Also pump 
the tires > 40psi, block the exhaust & intake ducts, clean & dry it.  
I've had problems with mice nesting in the spring; they love to use the 
under-hood foam to build nests!  (this foam was deleted in '87 or '88). 
 I used to put gas stabilizer in the tank, but no longer do, and it 
causes no problems with Mobil 93 octane (R+M/2) unleaded.

If you leave the battery in the car, put a trickle charger on it, else 
you'll be buying a new one come Spring.

I've seen the original list price quoted as both us$200,000 and

that now. Even so, if you could get one into the US, you wouldn't
be able to drive it. Porsche has not crash tested the car so it
cannot be imported because of DOT requirements. From the
rumour mill, Bill Gates, (CEO,Pres,King,Ruler,? of Microsoft), has
a 959 sitting in customs for that reason and he doesn't want to

I have herd the same thing about Bill Gates during an interview with
him.  He loves the car and I believe he did pay in the 300,000's for it.
Customs does want a crash test on the car but nobody is willing to shell
out the 300k to smash one into a wall "what a crime :(". It is in the US
though but its stuck in customs, I believe Bill's insurance agent goes
down to inspect it about every week too (lucky guy) I would think he
would need to make sure it would still be drivable too :) :)

i keep thinking about writing a piece about "that special hour" of the day when looking
at my [digital] watch evokes pleasant thoughts and memories.  i mean, of course, the
hour between 9 and 10, when nearly any time corresponds to something porsche.

does this happen to anyone else?

i mean, when i see 9:04, i can't help but think of the first fiberglass porsche which
was also the last street/race car.  or 9:06, the last left-hand drive racer.  etc, etc.

actually it doesn't happen to me every time.  i don't instantly think of whale tales
and slant noses when 9:30 rolls around.  but it never fails when i glimpse 9:51 on
my watch.  happens to me a couple times a week, it seems.

listen, am i big fan of 962s, probably would have welcomed the 989 to the family if
it had seen the light of day, look forward to the boxster, etc.  but once they got
past 959, i felt a sense of loss.

i'll probably never write the piece.. what's to say?

but, also dont want a straight pipe coming out of it either.

Opinions/ideas/comments??

I am beginning to look for a 914 to buy.  The ones I've looked at and talked ab
out all seem to crunch when shifted into 2nd.  I've been told it's my shifting,
 but I wonder.  Admittedly, I am looking at older and less expensive 914's, but
 do they all crunch into 2nd?

 Thanks in advance for any input!

Horrible prices.

I guess you had some problems importing cars in the 80's too??

Anyway the exchange rate should be the other way around i guess??

***** One dollar = Three Rands ? *****

Or am I wrong? If not,please let me borrow your lawn such that we can start
selling 91 Carrera4's for approx $ 1.5 millions a piece.

Subject: 959 $

    Andre-

    I understand how you could fall in love with this amazing piece of
    technology.  The body style alone is enough to send chills up my
    spine.

    I was in Germany in April of this year and visited a dealership
    that had two "new" 959s for sale.  As I recall, they were asking
    around $500,000.00 for each (one read, one silver- I am pretty
    sure neither were the "S" model).  You may ask how can a dealer be
    selling a car that is nearly 10 years old as "new."  Well, it
    seems that like a lot of American dealers, and private parties as
    well, German dealers don't consider the car "owned" unless it has
    been registered, despite the fact that the cars had nearly 1000 km
    on them already ("test miles" the dealer assured me!- yea, right).

    I believe that the 959 originally was sold by the factory for
    around $250,000.00.  Since its release, I have seen 959 Sport
    models for sale (not by the factory) for as much as $1,000,000.00,
    but the market for the high priced cars has dropped considerably,
    hence the $500,000.00 price for a "new" one.  I am not sure what
    the used market is fetching.

    I have never gotten to the bottom of why the 959 is not allowed in
    the States.  I have heard everything from no crash test (although
    I have read that the factory did crash one), to too much power for
    the American driver, to failure to comply with American emmision
    standards and even bumper problems.  I suspect that the true
    reason is that the American protectionism (market protectionism,
    that is) kept them out so the American manufacturers could "catch
    up" on some of the technology without looking like they were
    standing still.  All this aside, there are a few 959s in the
    States, including Vasek Pollak's, Chandler's (who got it in before
    the import ban), Andial's (who brought it in under the ban as a
    highly modified racer- never to be used on the street).

    Your dream might not be that far away, however.  All that you have
    to do is move to Germany, buy one there and drive it where and how
    it was meant to driven.  But oh yea, you said you weren't rich
    (most of us probably couldn't even afford the tax on this beauty).
     As a less expensive alternaive (notice I did not say "cheap"
    alternative), find yourself a C4 chasis and tranny and build up a
    450 hp twin turbo motor for it (the C4 tranny is in part based on
    the 959 and in some ways improves on it).  There are a couple of
    companies that manufacture and sell 959 body kits for around
    $5,000.00.  The body kits are made out of fiberglass, not Kevlar,
    but can be made to look pretty good depending upon the effort (you
    could have someone custom make the panels out of carbon fiber or
    Kevlar at a considerably higher cost- but Kevlar might be worth
    it in that it is super light yet has the rigidity of steel).

    After all my ramblings I noticed you are from Montreal.  Are the
    import restrictions the same up there?  If not, maybe my dream is
    only a few hundred miles away instead of a few thousand.  In any
    event, pleasant dreams!!

In Bill's case I believe it's hardly a matter of not wanting to shell out

Subject: Brakes

    Greetings Porschephiles-

    In the never ending effort to improve the performance of my 911,
    the thoughts shift once again to the brakes.  My 1971 911 has S
    front calipers (with Cool Carbon pads) which I fell are quite
    adequate.  But with all the other options available, I am
    wondering how much better the brakes could be.  Which leads me to
    the following questions:

     I have a chance to get slightly used set of crossed drilled
    rotors/discs for $75 each.  I believe this is a good price, is it?
     Am I going to notice a difference with these discs?  What is the
    purpose of cross drilling?  Is it for cooling? To get rid of dust?
    I heard that cross drilling was to help get rid of water, which is
    true?  Have they improved the technology enough so that cross
    drilling doesn't weaken the disc so much, or is it still a
    problem?

    How about Kevlar brake lines, has anyone found a source for
    Porsches and/or 911s yet?

    How about the factory installed brake dust shields- does any one
    track their cars with them installed?  With them removed does it
    help ventilation and cooling?  How about spacing between the
    caliper and the mount once the shield is removed, do you have to
    install a spacer or do you just bolt the calipers down?

    How about cool brakes?  Are they a worthy investment?  Has anyone
    found a cheaper alternative (i.e., home-made)?

    As always, comments, opinions, and answers are appreciated.

Subject: RE: Bill The Cat


I had this flip up in my mail this morning:

	THIS IS A TRUE STORY - SAD, BUT TRUE.  I have taken some
	liberties with the description in that Dave Barry-esque style
	which I admire.  Please feel free to re-distribute.

	---------------------------------------------------

	Seattle, August 23, 1993 -  Officer Barry Schuller of the
	Seattle Police is probably wondering what this world is coming
	to.  Barry is a cop, and if I might add; he's a damn good cop.
	Barry was recently awarded "Officer of the Year" honors by his
	superiors and his peers - no small accomplishment in a city the
	size of Seattle.  Yep Barry is a good cop, but even the good
	ones have bad weeks, I guess.

	On Monday, Barry was placed on 3 day suspension pending an
	investigation of what was reported as "questionable behavior".
	Barry was appalled - he hadn't done anything questionable - he
	hadn't stepped outside the bounds of his appointed tasks - he
	hadn't done anything except do his job in the same way he had
	been doing it all year - and that earned him Officer of the
	Year honors.  Barry is a good cop.

	Well it seems that our boy Barry saw fit to pull over a driver
	a couple of weeks ago and write that fellow up for exceeding
	the safe speed - a routine traffic violation.  You speed - you
	get caught - the officer writes you a ticket - you pay.  Pretty
	straight forward, you say.  Well guess again - it is not a
	routine traffic violation when the driver of the car is none
	other than that dastardly demon of the highways and byways -
	Mr. William Gates - the wealthiest man in America.  No siree
	Bob.  If Billy-boy wants to speed in Seattle, there is no law
	on the books that can stop him and certainly no Officer of this
	Year or any year that can write him up and make it stick.  Hey
	- you don't get to be America's wealthiest man by paying every
	darn traffic ticket you get now do you.  And when you get to be
	America's wealthiest man and employ 1/2 of Seattle, you make
	some friends in high places who can take care of little things
	like speeding tickets and who can take care of other little
	irritations like officers who write speeding tickets.  Makes
	you wonder why Billy-boy hasn't been able to get that
	impounded, street-illegal Porsche of his out of customs.  Of
	course that was done during a Republican administration.  Maybe
	Bill Clinton will be more forgiving - after all, they have the
	same first name...

	But back to Barry Schuller, decorated officer, family man, good
	cop...what can this man be thinking.  He's dedicated himself to
	a life of public service.  He's sworn to uphold the laws of the
	nation and the city of Seattle.  The man wears KEVLAR, for
	Christ's sake - and now some rich, coke-drinking, junk food
	eating, can't-stand-still, post- adolescent, nerd-weenie might
	just be costing him his career.  You have got to be kidding -
	this is AMERICA, land of the free, home of the brave. Can Bill
	Gates be - oh my - Above the Law.  Where the hell is Steven
	Segal?  Where is Jean Claude Van Damme?  Where is Bruce Willis?
	(Yippee Kiyay!) Where is Chuck Norris?  Where is CLINT
	EASTWOOD!  Oh s--t, where's Jeffrey Dalmer when we need him?
	This Gates guy is really scary.  He probably wanted
	Schwartzenegger to lose in Terminator 2 cause the other guy was
	more high tech and cause SGI went with NT...

	We can only hope that the "investigation" into the questionable
	behavior of Officer Schuller results in his complete and total
	exoneration.  Bill Gates has gone too far this time - just too
	damn far.  It was bad enough that Windows 3.0 barely worked at
	all and that Windows 3.1 was 18 months behind schedule.  The
	public can put up with the smoke and mirrors and more delays
	with the delivery of Windows NT which also barely works.  But
	Bill Gates has finally done it - he has struck a blow at the
	very core of America.  The wealthiest man in the country is
	trying to FIX a traffic ticket.  He's probably better off
	trying to fix his Operating System; but no, Bill Gates is
	trashing the life of a police officer in Seattle and by doing
	so placing himself in the company of such villians as Sadam
	Hussein, Lex Luthor, Dudley Nightshade and Snydley Whiplash.

BTW, I reid the `god@microsoft.com' and had the system echo back that I 
didn't have proper authorization. Is there something about all this that
we aren't aware of? Was the Bible done on the **wrong** operating 
system?

Stay tune to Porschephiles for the next episode.

Thanks Al,I checked the carbs and they are of 'super' specs.
I guess I'll have to give the engine a 'super' cam. 
This engine will go into a 1958 356 A coupe.

I also have this '60 T-5 coupe that perhaps will get the 'high-performance'
engine option.The car is all apart,blasted and awaiting metalwork.
This car is original in a special color,Royal Blue with light grey interior.
The car has three possibilities;1: Concours rebuild (Norwegian standard)
                                2: I sell it
                                3: Vintage race car.

So......,any suggestions are welcome.Concours,sell or race??

The T-5 needs new fenders and front clip.Any help to good used stuff
appreciated!

These parts are available new for approx $ 1200 for the front clip,and $ 600
each for the fenders from Germany.Guess I'll have to get them from there if
I would want new parts.

If enough 'porschephilers' are interested I'll give an insight in German
Porsche 356 part prices and sources.I have found these large body parts to
be cheaper in Germany.
Restoration Design is a lot cheaper on THEIR products,only they do not carry
front clip and fenders.

Engine and trim seems to be cheaper in the US.

    No, they don't all crunch going into second, and it's not (necessarily)
your
shifting.  The problem is that synchros seem to go on these cars with
depressing
regularity.  Mosts cars that are reasonably priced tend to have a lot of miles
on
them, so usually first-, and frequently second-gear synchros are on the way
out.  This *can* be overcome with *careful* and slow shifting, however.
And transmission re-builds are *expensive*.

Good luck in your search!

Subject: Brakes


Hi Guys,


Brakes. I see someone (Steve, I couldn't get you directly) is interested
in improving the brakes on his (or her) car. 
First, I wouldn't use cross-drilled rotors on the street, they get too
much heat and crud into the pad. They also reduce the effective area and
cause accelerated fatigue.

Cross drilling works when you're racing in very wet conditions, the 
holes sipe the water away from the surface of the disc and let the pad 
wipe down to the rotor surface, improving brake performance.

Radial grooving (3 shallow grooves per surface) does much more. Check 
the solid rotor small formula cars. The groove removes the brake debris
from hard braking without the problems of cross drilling. This is the 
trick for you 914/4 owners with the stock brake setup.

The biggest problem I've seen is the use of tires that don't match the 
dynamic characteristic of your brakes. Almost all Porsches i've driven 
have more brake than tire. As an example, the 944 with 7 & 8 in x 15 in
wheels uses 215/60 tires. A better setup for handleing is 205 front, 215 rear, EXCEPT that braking suffers. The 215s all around help balance the
brakes and counteract the weight transfer. 

Pay attention to the coefficient of adhesion, the sticky rating by DOT 
also means the tire should stop well. 

One other thing, Don't cross drill solid rotors. They will crack after 
only a few uses. Grooving works much better for street vehicles. For 
track vehicles, do what ever you want, I'm not into mail-order race 
prep.

Subject: Re:  914 2nd gear

Hugh,

Part of your problem is the "older and less expensive 914's" often come
with the older and less accurate 'tail shift' transmission.  You could
either 1) update to a 'side shifter', or 2) look for newer 914's 
that already have one.  I would suggest going for a newer 914 because
you'll have all the advantages/advances of the newer car, and you'll have
everything right from the start so you can enjoy the car.

Also, don't forget to take the car to a good mechanic that knows Porsches
and have it checked out.  If it's your shifting and not the gearbox, this
will help track that down.

Yup. Pretty much so. And 1st, too, BTW.

Even if you change the synchros, you'll only get 10-15k miles before
it starts crunching again. Has to do with the design of the Porsche
synchro, the metal it's made out of, and the shift angle.

You can make it "go away" by double clutching or by shifting slowly. Or
you can just do what I do, which is let 'em make noise until they stop
shifting at all, then get another transmission...

don't know that there *IS* a right that's different from "running as

a 911, they're gonna be *REALLY SURPRISED* at some point.

Still, it should be on everyone's bookshelf, if for no other reason than

This is also done to "gas check" the brakes. See, as the friction material
wears away, there is often time a gas build-up. There may also be gas
build-up from the rapid expansion of any air caught between the pad and the
rotor, or trapped by the very slight irregularities in the surface. If you
get enough of this, you build a very nice air bearing between the pad and
the rotor. Just the way I want *MY* brakes to work... The grooves (also 
called "fire slots") allow the gas to escape, preventing this from
happening and improving braking. Works for water, too, as Jim noted.

Here's A Problem for the Guru's,

My '76 911 with vacuum-boosted brakes has a transient brake
"condition."  After driving awhile without using the brakes,
the brake pedal gets progressively firmer, as if being bled
while under way.  This is nice at the track at the end of a
long straight, but . . . After an extended cruise (1 hour +,
80 mph +), the brake pedal is now so firm that the brakes are
slowing the car.  After stomping the pedal a few times, and
scaring everyone else on the freeway, the pedal turns to 
relative mush (not failed but not race car firm either),
and the cycle begins again.

Any Ideas?  Is there an adjustment on the pedal or the booster
that is allowing engine vacuum to apply the brakes?

Steve,
  When the 959s were delivered to Holbert's Porsche, they had complete
interiors and the powers to be decided it was really a street car - or could
be with little grief.  In any event it was decided that they were to go
home.  This all happened at the time of Al Holbert's death and no one picked
up the ball to fight the govt on it.  The cars were not street certified and
at the time Porsche had no intention of doing so.  Once their fate was
sealed, Porsche notified the govt that the cars could not be converted
properly to street use in order to kill the grey market for them.
  This information, btw, was gathered from Holbert's and some Porsche
people.  It was during one of my terms as region prez when they were
delivered and since Holbert's is a local dealership, I spent alot of time
there while they were gathering dust waiting to be shipped back.
  Al, IMHO, is an exception to the rule that everyone can be replaced.
Aside from losing the 959, thats when Porsche racing here started it's big
slide.  He was in the right place at the right time and there was noone to
fill his shoes.
 
  I installed Cool Brakes on my 944 when I got tired of replaceing warped
rotors from track events.  They did just fine.  When I got the 911, it was
the 1st thing I put on them and have yet to replace a rotor.
  Have never used drilled rotors since folks cant seem to agree on thier
worth - at least at my level of driving.  If I were going to Daytona or Le
Mans I might reconsider :->

Here's a copy of an article I read in the Daily Mail, Friday.  It's titled:

Porsche man went bananas when it rained sandwiches
======= === ==== ======= ==== == ====== ==========

The driver of an open-top Porsche lost his temper when food was thrown
into his car and landed on his face.
  
The gooey mess, hurled from a camper van while he was stopped at traffic
lights also spattered his girlfriend.

Anton Jones, a 27 year-old property dealer, chased the van for two miles
through busy city streets, trading insults with the other motorist.

When the van driver told him: 'Why don't you p--- off you prat,' Jones
leaped from his Porsche 911 at traffic lights and whacked the van's door
with a piece of wood.

'I don't regret what I did,' he told Cardiff magistrates yesterday.  'We
were just sitting in the car at traffic lights when all these old
sandwiches, bananas and bits of various food landed on us.'  His 24 year-
old girlfriend, Nicola Be Parry, was struck on the head.  'When I saw the
driver grinning in his Volkswagen camper I just snapped,' he said.

Jones, of West Road, Llantwit Major, admitted causing criminal damage and
threating behaviour and was conditionally discharged for a year.

Magistrate John Read refused to order him to pay compensation for denting
the van, saying: 'People who throw litter from cars should be taken to 
court more often.'

Beware of aftermarket cross-drilled rotors.  If the material & 
manufacturing process has not taken the drilling into account, you'll 
have a rotor which is substantially weakened and may crack (suddenly) 
wih high pedal force.  We do not allow anything but OEM cross-drilled 
rotors in our track events in New England!  Drill & slotted rotors also 
wear the pads faster.

If you don't know you need these special rotors, then you probably 
don't.  I'd suggest putting $$$ into tires and going to track events, 
not adding equipment which you may only be using %50 anyway.

What for?  Stock rubber ones in good condition are hard to beat.  A 
recent thread on this subject on Porschephiles touched on this - the 
outcome was that braided lines (and the Kevlar) are fine for heavy duty 
work where you maintain the car a lot and have a sharp mechanic to 
install them.  Imperfect use of these lines leads to failure, which in 
the case of brakes, can be a literal pain in the neck!

These are splash shields, not dust shields.  You can run with or 
without them.  If you have Cool Brakes, you'll have to remove them.

Dust shields, which are an aftermarket item, should *never* be used on 
the track, but are fine in "normal" conditions & autocrosses, where 
heat is essentially a non-issue.

it was for a specific day and time. The tour left from the Porsche

about a tour and were told that they had to have prior reservations.

My tour seemed a bit short, but worthwhile. The most depressing part was
the fact that most everyone else on the tour was there to pick up their

    Larry (and all those out there planning a pilgrimage- I did mine

    I am not sure about the CanAm collection, but I have a few
    suggestions for your trip to Germany.

    -Car museum in Mulhouse France (just over the French/German
    border in Alsace).  A huge collection of cars with a great
    concentration of Bugattis and a few Porsches.

    -Rossi Collection in Aschaffenburg.  Mostly racing cars- just
    east-south-east of Frankfurt.

    -Porsche museum and factory in Stuttgart (obviously a must)- call
    PCNA for reservations for a tour BEFORE you go- I have the number
    somewhere if you need it.

    -Mercedes factory/museum in Stuttgart- I did not go so I can't
    say much, but if you have time I hear it is worth it.

    -30 Years of the 911 exhibit at the Auto & Technik Museum at
    Sinsheim (South of Frankfurt)- a decent exhibit (if you are there,
    make sure you try their "flight simulator" with the Rally program,
    it alone is worth the trip!!).

    Good luck and I hope your trip is an enjoyable one.

For Larry and anyone else headed for Germany in the near or not so near 
future, I believe the collection he is referring to is the Rosso Bianco 
collection in Aschaffenburg, near Frankfurt.  I went there about four years 
ago and it was quite impressive.  At the time, I think they had about 
200-250 cars, all of the sporting variety, ranging from genuine antiques to 
relatively recent exotics and racing machines.  Everything was in German, 
but they were in the midst of installing a CD-ROM bilingual information 
system complete with video clips as well as your more basic database 
capabilities.  I don't have the address, but it's in an old warehouse 
complex.  If my memory was a bit better, I could probably give you 
directions, but it was a long time ago and I was still reeling from my first 
"hat trick" (three tickets in one stop, without ever leaving second gear - 
easy to do in a 930).  I believe Autoweek ran an article on it in the past 
year, perhaps I can find the issue.  At any rate, I recommend it highly and 
wandering around lost in Aschaffenburg for a couple of hours should be a 
small price to pay for such an experience.  Enjoy...  JW

Jim,

I don't have empherical data on this, you might contact Bob Strange at 
BF Goodrich for the real scientific stuff. Here's what seat of the pants
told us 20 or so years ago:

I was racing Corvettes back then and we had terrible luck with brakes, 
even the old Mione pads would be totally trashed in a 30 minute race.
So I went through a period of improving everything  until the brakes 
really worked, but then the handling went bad under braking at Sears
Point. It wanted to dart. I spent a month working on the front end
when the pro tour showed up at Laguna Seca, so I went to Leo Mehl and 
showed him the tires I was using (24.0 x 9.0 x 15) on the front. He 
went to a chart and explained that the cross section and height were 
incorrect for my weight vehicle. He suggested 25.0 X 8.5 x 15 and I 
tried them.  They worked, the darting stopped and the front end worked 
better.

The point is, as Leo told me after the race, the contact patch has only
a part of the equation. The tire casing, cord angle and construction 
make a lot of the reasons that a tire works well. A generic street tire
is as well engineered as a race tire, but it has road hazard, longevity,
load and shelf life to contend with. Rcae tires are purpose built and 
usually are engineered to be fronts or rears for a specific weight 
range of vehicle. It also is important if the rear end has weight bias
and is independent or solid.

Back to the question. I'd try the car in question for braking in a safe 
place. Nail the brakes hard and see if the fronts lock with the brake
system in normal street configuration. Almost all of the disc brake 
Porsches should lock the fronts first. If this occurs you have to shift 
some bias to the rears, as the car will have the same characteristics 
on the track. You may need to use a proportioning valve or adjust the 
one in the car, but adjust it so the rears pull down equally with the 
fronts.

Once that is done, then you can experiment with tires. Remember this: if
you go down in aspect ratio on a given size, your contact patch will 
shrink accordingly. If you reduce the circumference of the tire, you 
will be more likely to lock up the brakes. If you start with a 185/70,
then the most likely size that will work is a 205/60 or a 215/50.

That's the start. It takes a little time to play with the right sizes, 
but what you have to realize is that the newer tires are built for 
specific front/rear use. They're direction on the best ones, so most 
of the  work is in selecting the right size. Porsche has taken some 
of the responsibility and had Yokohama make a special compound and 
casing for Porsches (A008P) 
This is gettin a little long for here, but we have these discussions
all the time, they never will be finished (probably good, things get 
better as a result).

A German-car wise friend of mine told me about a condition which occurs on
914 cars which have had the flexible brake lines replaced with braided
stainless lines. The result was that where previously, the flexible rubber
lines had enough give to prevent this condition, the stainless lines allow
more stress to be applied to the sheet metal on which the master cylinder
is mounted, and that sheet metal would then deform and crack. Stiffeners
could be used to prevent this condition.

Subject: Blaupunkt SQR23

An Electronic Outlet is having a close-out sale on a
"Blaupunkt DENVER SQ" stereo and CD player. The price is good
and it also comes with removable face plate. The ad mentions
that it need a separate Amp. Since, I don't claim to understand
everything when it comes to Hi-Fi stuff, I have the following
concerns.        

  - Is the "Blaupunkt Montery SQR23" on my 944 comes has a
    separate Amp. 

  - If not, can I install the "Blaupunkt DENVER SQ" and use the
    "Blaupunkt Montery SQR23" to substitute as an Amp. i.e. does
    it have input Aux port in the back.

The second is my preferred choice, since I would like to leave
the original installed.

Affie.

Affie,

Regarding the Montery SQR23,  it is a integrated radio, preamp and amp all 
in one.   It does not have any preamp input to drive out from another input
source.  You would also have a problem on where to mount it under the dash, 
etc.   You could use it but would need to open it up and connect into the 
amp section inside. (remember comments on soldering)

This doesn't mean that there isn't a separate amp in your car.   My 928 had 
a separate amp beside the passengers seat.   It took the output from the 
Montery (speaker out) with a transformer to drive additional speakers 
in the car.  Hopefully one of the other audiophiles with a 944 can bring 
that to light.

Considering the price, it looks like a good deal on the surface,  but 
compare it along with a power amp with equal output to other systems they 
sell to get a full up system price comparison.  

I just replaced my Montery with an Alpine CD unit and with its power (4x25) 
no longer am using the separate amp.  There is nothing like listening to 
"Born to be Wild" while on your favorite deserted section of highway....
There, I dated myself.

Good luck,  Steve

There is an opening under the radio, that seems just right to house
the new unit or under the seat.

No! I don't remember, may be you can shed some more light on the subject.

I am waiting for the "other audiophiles".

I can get this unit for $199. I just thought that this is a good price to add
a CD in the car. Since Blaupunkt is OEM brand, I figured, if I mount the
new unit under the existing Blaupunkt, it will appear very original to many of
my naive passenger seat companions.

Subject: Bill Gates/tickets

Jim Pasha posted a story about a recent Bill Gates traffic ticket incedent.
I am in no way connected to Bill or the mighty MS, but let me come in here
with a different perspective. My information is based on an article in the
local Seattle paper, the Seattle P-I.
The reason why the officer was disciplined was not that he gave Bill a speed-
ing ticket. Rather, the officer gave Bill a ticket for having expired proof
of insurance. In WA, you have to have proof of insurance on you all the time.
Appearently, the incedent happened at around 12:30 am, and Bill's proof of
insurance had expired at 12:00am, a half-hour earlier. The P-I quoted a local
police supervisor as saying that police are supposed to give a five day grace
period for this offence.
Just to clarify, the ticket was not actually given in Seattle, but in Bellevue,
in fact I believe it was Medina. Understand that Bellevue is the "rich" suburb
to Seattle, and Medina is the "really rich" part/suburb to Bellevue.
If memory serves me right, Bill was driving on a road that parallels the golf
course there, it's a fairly wide shouldered 2 lane road. The other side are
fenced-in houses, and I believe there are no driveways onto the street in que-
stion. There is one intersection along the way.
Bill allegedly did about 15mph over.
I personally think that are a lot more serious traffic violations than speeding,
and think that police in general (not just for Bill, for me too!) should be
more linient on us.
I am certainly not in favor of special treatment for Bill, or Bill fixing his
tickets due to his standing in the community/economy around here.
But we could all use some slack, and a 30 minute grace period on proof of insurance-
ance is the least I would expect.

 Cross drilling can do a number of things. Depending on the size and
 location of the holes it can both reduce or enlarge the surface area
 of the disc. So you can use the drilling of holes to help the disc
 heat up (rarely a problem in cars) or to cool down (often a problem).
 
 Be aware that if you drill a rotor you are probably going to shorten
 it's lifespan - you tend to get cracking. Which is why people tend to
 cut grooves in them these days.

 The holes can also help sweep exhaust gases away from the surface of
 the pads - which also promotes cooling.

 They doing nothing whatsoever to improve braking in the wet. A number
 of tests have been done which show this conclusively.

 Finally, drilling holes will lighten the disc which can lead to a 
 bit better unsprung weight and suspension response. However, this is
 probably negligible on most cars (unless you're driving some Kevlar
 bodied carbon-framed monster).

 cheers,
 Stef

Mark,
I thought anybody could take the factory tour if you signed up beforehand.  
When I was there in 1990, there were a number of groups signed for various 
hours of the day.  You should also try to see the Mercedes factory in 
Stuttgart.  I enjoyed both tours.

I didn't get any free samples from Porsche, however I did have lunch in their 
cafeteria, of course I bought my car through the factory via my dealer.  I 
wouldn't recommend anybody to purchase their car from the factory--too much 
hassle and red tape.  But I understand Mercedes does an excellent job of it, 
plus they'll pay you for one night stay too.

These are my opinions only,

Scott,

I'm certainly no thermal expert but..
I think what was meant was:  increase cooling surface area not pad to
rotor surface area.  

The inside surface of the hole through the rotor,
depending on the thickness of the rotor, may equate to a larger exposed
surface area than the diameter of the material that was removed.
Allowing more airflow through the rotor, and eliminating mass, all 
contribute to better heat dissipation?

Then one can argue, if the heat doesn't dissipate into the air well in this 
new cross drilled rotor, then the heat just transfers on to the pad and 
caliper?  Potentially causing a greater brake problem, boiling fluid?

Quickly, run to the appliance store and get some dryer ducting to direct
air to the brakes... :)

Oooh, all that was tough to try to communicate.  

Now this is purely for discussion so no flaims about which physics
book I'm using please.

Subject: spacers and coolers

i am in the middle of a project and need advice.  i have a 911sc that i am
converting to  C2 slantnose turbo body work. i have finished the  addition
of the rear flares, front fenders bumper caps etc. here is what i need to know
1- because of the flares i need to space my wheels out. i see 3 options.
spacers that bolt on to the stock hub,  long studs and spacers , wheels with
the offset shifted to fit turbo bodywork and non-turbo suspension.
(i would like to keep stock offset wheels and be as safe as possible)
which of the above methods is considered correct and safe? (long studs and
spacers look best to me)

2- because of the slant fenders i have to replace the front loop cooler
 with a front mount cooler. i have aeroquip fittings and line to run
to the front (all -12) but have not selected an oil cooler yet. looking at the
factory loop anything would appear more effective (more surface area better
airflow with front mount). can somebody suggest a good cooler that is reasonably
priced? how big should it be?

 any suggestions are much appreciated.
