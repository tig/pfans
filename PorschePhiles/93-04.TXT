Subject: Re: Finalizing my decision.

Mark -

Since no one else has ventured an opinion or reply, I guess I might.  As
to "worth," I assume you mean fair market value.  They lie somewhere in
between the prices of a 944 and a 944 Turbo, which isn't a terribly big
spread these days.  The car was made for model years '87 and '88,
replaced in '89 by the 944S2.

As far as reliability, the 944S has two notable points.  First is that it
has a wider and longer cam timing belt that its eight-valve siblings.  I
recommend strongly updating it to the .02 belt (or newer, if it has since
been superceded) used in the 944S2 and which superceded the original and
recall parts.  While there were not enough 944S to draw black-and-white
conclusions, the earlier cam belts seem to have been prone to unexpected
failure.  Certainly was the case when mine went!

The other maintenance point is that the '87 944S seems to have born the
brunt of a run of bad oil/water heat exchangers.  For some reason, the 87
944S seems to have the failure more often than the 944.

Otherwise, the car has less stuff to go wrong and cost money than a 944
Turbo, and is on par with a 944.  Performance wise, its horsepower falls
between the 944 and 944 Turbo, while it has a wider, flatter torque
curve than a 944 Turbo but a little less low-end torque than a 944.  The
944S has the 944 Turbo's gearing, except that it has the same final as
a 944.

I like 'em.  But I own one.

Subject: book on 86 930??


All,

I have started to look for a 930, I have a good idear about what they
are selling for but the ones I have been looking at tend to be Grey Market
cars.
1984-88 or 89 in the area that I am willing to pay.
My questions:

1)How can you tell which years are better than others? newer is better right?

2) I looked up in a blue book the value of an 86 911 cabriolet to compare it
in price to what I am looking at (86 930 w/24K miles very clean).
Is this the right thing to do?? retail book was about 27K and this guy wants
34K-35K for the car.

3) They say they have all the paper work on the conversion to US spec
and it has been titled in the US.
I plan on brining it to a shop to have a complete check out done but I'd
like to try to avoid particular cars if I knew a little in advance.

4) Are these cars hard to find?? or is it me. Yes I have the Dupont Registry
and about every local advertising paper/magazine. Is there another
publication that I can order?

Thanks for all your help
If anyone emails me direct I will post a summary. Other than that I hope
I'm not the only one in the dark about 930's and grey market 930's.

Subject: SUNSTRUCK FLASH: SUNTANK ANNOUNCES SuperSHARK CARRERA CLASSIC


The annual Sun Microsystems April Fool's Day joke on some executive

Probably of interest to the porschephiles...  Those in the San Francisco
Bay area can view it from the outside of the building.  It's in
Mountain View, off 101 at Rengsdorff.  I can give directions to those
interested.

This year they took Andy Bechtolsheim's 911 Cabriolet and placed it
in his office.  The top is down and there's a large fish tank inside,
with a Sun workstation under the water and a monitor displaying 
an aquarium scene.

All of this was done overnight without the person knowing about it.  This
incident involved removing a wall (real wall..  plasterboard and all) and
probably the windows.  Somehow, they got the keys to the car and 
placed it inside the slightly enlarged room, then everything is put
back in place.

		SUNTANK ANNOUNCES NEW OFFICE WORKSTATIONS

		SuperSHARK CARRERA CLASSIC UNVEILED TODAY

SunTank, a division of SunStruck, Inc., today announced the availability 
of a high performance portable computing system designed for the small 
office environment -- the SuperSHARK Carrera Classic. The new system, based 
on the Convertible Office Submersible Environment (COSE) specification, 
was unveiled this morning in the Mountain View office of company founder, 
Andreas Fish Bechtolshiem.

"This technology is an enhanced version of our SHARKstation product 
line. It shows our total commitment to 32-bite commuting and powerful 
hardware," said Bechtolshiem. "And it's my favorite color, too."

The heart, or rather guts, of the system lie in its 120-Megabuck
SuperSHARK processor chip. Despite being a much smaller version of the 
7-gill processor in the original SHARKstation 1 machine, the new 
SuperSHARK is ferocious enough to destroy its closest competitors in 
seconds.  Today the SuperSHARK was demonstrated performing at an 
astounding 100-tetrabites per second.

The true beauty of the new SuperSHARK system is in its European-engineered 
Carrera packaging. The sleek, aerodynamic chassis is built for high 
maneuverability and has a convenient user interface. "We are delighted that 
the SuperSHARK chip can deliver so much power to our stylish exterior," 
commented Hans EinFranz, project manager for Pisce, the German 
hardbody manufacturer that co-designed the Carrera Classic with 
Bechtolshiem. With a full 200 gallon tank capacity, front and rear 
wheel stabilizers, and roomy plexiglass interior, the SuperSHARK 
Carrera Classic office workstation is truly a user's dream of high 
functionality at a low price. (Suggested retail: $7995, tax, license, 
and dealer-installed Cabriolet top extra. Non-discountable.)

No hardware system is complete without a robust operating 
environment.  The SuperSHARK-powered Carrera system runs Windows ET 
from SunSlosh, a sister company of SunTank. "The WET environment 
puts a whole new motif on transparent, distributed hydrokinetic computing," 
said Ned Zander, president and chief perch at SunSlosh. "Of course, 
no one really knows what that means, but it sounds good. 
Let's just say - the system goes fast, and it's powerful."

At the bottom of the SuperSHARK system is SunLinks, a set of 
ground-level user tools for increased office productivity. The compact 
SunLinks course adds even more stability and entertainment value 
to the Carrera office system.

Initial market reaction for the SuperSHARK and the related technologies 
has been remarkably favorable. "I saw a beta version, and I had to 
have one in my office immediately," commented Lotty Varey, 
Bechtolshiem's neighbor.

SunStruck executive Sturgeon McReely noted, "It's the ultimate 
driving machine. Oh no, that's the other German guys. Anyway, 
it's what I've been trying to develop all along - a computer
that's as easy to use as driving a car."

"This is the pinnacle of the series that I foresaw years ago," 
commented Wilhelm Glad, former user of an on-pond system.

Depending on further market acceptance, the SunTank team may introduce 
an AstroSHARK server version later this summer.

>...but the ones I have been looking at tend to be Grey Market cars.

It's good you're asking questions. Grey market cars have some advantages,
but some disadvantages as well. 

I own a grey market 911SC. I know. The big problem you're going to find 
is that you just can't get the fuel injection parts you need *UNLESS* the
whole FI system was converted to US spec when it was EPA'd. The Euro parts
are NLA in the US, as people used them to boost performance on their wimpy
US spec engines, and boosted the emissions as well. So they got removed from
the market. I do have European contacts for this stuff, and there's a guy
on the east coast who seems to have had *some* luck finding stuff for me,
but in general, it's a hard problem.

>2) I looked up in a blue book the value of an 86 911 cabriolet to compare it

>Is this the right thing to do?? retail book was about 27K and this guy wants
>34K-35K for the car.

Don't pay an inflated price for *ANY* car, and in particular, a grey market
model!!! The market is soooo soft out there that you can get really good
deals if you are patient and do your homework.

>3) They say they have all the paper work on the conversion to US spec
>and it has been titled in the US.

>like to try to avoid particular cars if I knew a little in advance.

You also want to *VERIFY* with the EPA and DOT (and your state transportation
department) that this *IS* an accredited conversion. You *MUST* acquire the
original paperwork or legible copies with the car. Don't lose it.

If the paperwork is faked, you could be liable for making it legal, plus
fines. Or lose the car.

>4) Are these cars hard to find?? or is it me. Yes I have the Dupont Registry
>and about every local advertising paper/magazine. Is there another
>publication that I can order?

Nope, but you should be looking on a national basis. Try Panorama, the national
Porsche club magazine, Excellence, a wonderful Porsche-only magazine found
at most quality newsstands, and the Porsche Market Letter, which is published
by this guy in Oklahoma and advertised in both of the above. Avoid Hemmings,
avoid DuPont -- they're aimed at the "gold-chain", "more money than sense"
crowd who (a) don't know any better and (b) think it's cool to pay a lot of
money for something because well, then it's worth a lot, right?

April 1993

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

Well, another month, another zillion dollars spent on Porsche parts...
I suppose the biggest Porsche news was the "hack" perpetrated at
Sun Microsystems against Andy Bechtolsheim, involving (among other
things) putting his '92 911 Cabrio in his office. Thanks to Garry
Cook for bringing this to our attention!

Second call: is there any interest in a Porschephiles get-together at 
Parade? I'm not sure I'll be there, but there is a very good chance of
it....

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available, which is perhaps unfortunate. Oh well.

Remember, while it seems like a good idea when you're first starting out
on the list to know what has gone on before, there are OVER 7 MEG of 
archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. Period. And PLEASE DO 
NOT FTP between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll have to take access away. 
We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, you know...  Also DO NOT 
ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too much work. Thank you.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business service where we could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

I still edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region of the PCA, and
still plan to put some of the articles on-line for FTP in 
/pub/pca/newsletters/lone-star. If you edit a newsletter or would like to just i
type in articles from your newsletter, you can upload them into the directory
/pub/pca/newsletters/UPLOAD.

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (800) 582-6892.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Subject: 911 Oil Pressure Problem

The oil pressure indications in my 1966 911 have been getting a little
flakey lately, so I'd like to see what the collective wisdom of this
group has to offer as to possible causes.

First, a couple of notes about the engine. Mileage is ~135K, the bottom
end is original, and the upper end was done about 70K miles ago,
compression is even across all cylinders but down about 15% compared to
when the upper end was fresh. The only work done to the oil system
since I've owned the car is to repair the oil cooler, replace the oil
tank to pump oil supply hose, and to replace the oil temp sender (which
required replacing the gauge (with the guts of a newer one to keep the
same external appearance.) The oil temperature is within the normal
range, even when the pressure is low.

The pressure is fine when the engine is started in the morning: an
indicated 60 PSI at speed (~3k RPM) and an indicated ~20 PSI at idle.)
After the engine has been driven to work (5 miles), the at speed
indication drops to ~55 PSI and at idle the pressure is ~0. According
to the workshop manual, the pressure relief valve is supposed to do its
thing at around 80 PSI, so I presume that this the max oil pressure.
Thus my pressure indications could be off by as much as 20 PSI.

This is how the car has been since I bought it 19 years ago. If it is
relevant, according to the oil temp gauge, the engine/oil has always
been slow to warm up.

A few months ago, the at-speed-when-warm reading changed.  This change
only occurs later in the day, after the engine has gone through a few
start-run-stop cycles. For instance, yesterday I drove to work, ran an
errand at lunchtime (10 miles), drove home, and then went out to a
meeting (25 mile RT.)  In the morning the pressure was fine. To and
from the meeting the at speed pressure never exceeded ~25 PSI (at
engine speeds of 3-4000 RPM.) I can't say for sure, but the last trip
of the day may be when the oil gets the hottest (and thinnest.)

There aren't any large external oil leaks. Suspecting a viscosity
breakdown, a couple of weeks ago I changed the oil and filter (Pennzoil
20-50), adjusted the valves, tested the compression, and replaced the
oil tank to oil pump oil supply hose (which was leaking.) The result
was no change in the "late day pressure."

I speculate that one of the oil pressure relief or bypass valves is
malfunctioning, but can't explain why the problem only shows up after
several run-stop cycles and then goes away after the engine has sat
overnight. I also wonder if the new oil temp sender and/or gauge
somehow is connected to the pressure circuit, and causes false readings
when the oil temp goes past a threshold.

I plan to measure the resistance across the sending unit when the
indicated pressure is 60 and when it is 25; if the values are nearly
the same I would conclude that the gauge is failing. The resistance
across the sending unit will also be measured when the engine is not
running, i.e., the actual oil pressure is zero, and compared to the
resistance when the gauge indicates zero - this should tell me whether
the zero reading is something to worry about (after 19 years.) Heck,
maybe idle pressure really _is_ zero, and after 19 years the bearings
are shot... No unusual noises, though.

Any thoughts/suggestions?

Thanks

Rod

Subject: 924 Turbo

New to the group, so I will keep it short and sweet.

I have an '80 924 Turbo, the motor has been rebuilt 3 times, nothing left to
bore out.  I have an opportunity to purchase a new non-turbo block with pistons
crank, etc. for only $450.  I know the turbo has 7.5:1 and the non-turbo has
8.5:1.

Is there a difference between the two types of blocks other than compression
ratio?

Will the non-turbo block compression be too high with the turbo head, turbo,
etc.?

Any suggestions?

BTW, the new block is from Vasek Polak in So. Calif.

Subject: Re: 911 Oil Pressure Problem

I don't have any good advice to offer about your oil pressure other
than "maybe the relief spring is weak at high temperatures", which
you thought of already. I can look up the specs on spring length and 
K this weekend if you need them.

What struck me as odd was the following:

> First, a couple of notes about the engine. Mileage is ~135K, the bottom
                                                                   ^^^^^^
> end is original, and the upper end was done about 70K miles ago,
                           ^^^^^

These terms, obviously, are holdovers from the non-horizontally-opposed
engine designs, where the heads are above the cylinders, which are above
the crank. For us flat-6 and flat-4 enthusiasts, the terms somehow fail
to ring true... perhaps "inner" and "outer" wouldbe more descriptively
accurate?

Sun's April Fool's Day Joke involving one of the exec's 911 cabriolet
made the local and national news (ABC Evening News) yesterday.  In true
Sun tradition, there are T-shirts available to commemorate the
occassion.  Several of you asked me to get them for you.  Done deal..
they are on the way.  For the remainder of you that would like to order
one, today was the last day I could personally pick one up.  However,
there is a way you can order directly from our "propoganda
maker/distributor" via email or fax.

There is a minimum of Sun advertising, so it should be safe
to wear at HP, DEC, or IBM.  :^)

They are light grey.  On the front is a highly modified Porsche style
crest on one side.  In the four quadrants are:


	A 45 degree angle view of a red 911
	The Sun logo
	A sharks fin in water
	A desk with chair and lamp


On the back is a large, red 911 cab, top down, filled with water, small
Sun logo on the hood, and a shark sticking up, Jaws style.  Under it it
says:

	superSHARK
	 4.1.93


They look great....  Just ask Stan after he receives his!

Here are the instructions.  A fine addition to your Porsche-wear
collection.

Rod, if your car runs OK with 0 psi oil, I would suspect that it isn't
really seeing 0 psi.  Like you say, I'd check the pressure sender and
its wiring.  The sender itself isn't expensive.  Check the gauge too.

To the fellow who wants to get a new block for his 931:
As I recall, there are no differences between the block of the 924 and the 931,
hwever, the 931 has much lower compression pistons and, if I remember right, a
different head.  So, If you have been doing cleanup bores to your 931 (which se
ems unlikely if it cannot be bored again) you could"bolt"your pistons right in
the 924 block... If you have little meat left in your 931, you must have gotten
 big bore pistons, in which case the       924 block will need to be bored also
The blocks are the same though,so no problem.
Q: Are the heads different, anyone???
I've heard that the big bore 931's with a bit of head work and no catalytic
converters really fly... Chuck

Subject: 911 Oil Pressure Problem


   The oil pressure indications in my 1966 911 have been getting a little
   flakey lately, so I'd like to see what the collective wisdom of this
   group has to offer as to possible causes.

   Any thoughts/suggestions?

I suspect that if you change senders and replace the bypass springs
and pistons no change will occur. Why? Because I've been through all
of this exact thing before and nothing seems to help. After speaking
to several experts and surveying many early 911 owners I came to
the conclusion that ~0 psi at idle is "normal" on some cars and they
can run for a long time before overhaul. In actuality the pressure
is not really zero but thats what the gauge reads. If it makes you
feel any better I've been running my '73 911 with this type of
pressure for years (including some track driving) with no ill effect.
The car typically runs (when hot) 60-70 psi at 3000rpm and ~0 at idle.

If you were talking about an SC or Carrera I would say something is
wrong, but on a pre-78 911 I would make some routine checks but
you may have to accept the low pressure and live with it.

I also own a 1987 944S. Kevin Gross answered some of the value and
maintenance questions, and I agree with the answers. One additional
issue to consider is that some of the parts for the 944S are unique,
and, due presumably to low volume, are significantly more expensive
than for either a 944 or a 944 Turbo. On the relative performance
issue, I find that the 944S is much closer to the 944 than to the
turbo, despite the HP ratings that put the S about half way between
(147 for the 944, 188 for the S and 217 for the turbo, if I recollect).
The 944S has somewhat longer ratios in the intermediate gears, which
hurts acceleration somewhat. Overall, my experience is that the 944S
is roughly equivalent in power to a 944 with a chip (about +10%),
at least for one direct comparison (the run from turn 1 to turn 5 at
Watkins' Glen). Others who have raced both say that on a dyno, the
944S can get on the order of 5-10 more HP than a 944. So, overall,
the 944S is a nice car, but don't pay a significant amount more for
one over a regular 944 expecting to get 40 more HP.

It's good you're asking questions. Grey market cars have some advantages,
but some disadvantages as well. 

I own a grey market 911SC. I know. The big problem you're going to find 
is that you just can't get the fuel injection parts you need *UNLESS* the
whole FI system was converted to US spec when it was EPA'd. The Euro parts
are NLA in the US, as people used them to boost performance on their wimpy
US spec engines, and boosted the emissions as well. So they got removed from
the market. I do have European contacts for this stuff, and there's a guy
on the east coast who seems to have had *some* luck finding stuff for me,
but in general, it's a hard problem.

>2) I looked up in a blue book the value of an 86 911 cabriolet to compare it

Don't pay an inflated price for *ANY* car, and in particular, a grey market
model!!! The market is soooo soft out there that you can get really good
deals if you are patient and do your homework.

>3) They say they have all the paper work on the conversion to US spec

You also want to *VERIFY* with the EPA and DOT (and your state transportation
department) that this *IS* an accredited conversion. You *MUST* acquire the
original paperwork or legible copies with the car. Don't lose it.

If the paperwork is faked, you could be liable for making it legal, plus
fines. Or lose the car.

>4) Are these cars hard to find?? or is it me. Yes I have the Dupont Registry
>and about every local advertising paper/magazine. Is there another

Nope, but you should be looking on a national basis. Try Panorama, the national
Porsche club magazine, Excellence, a wonderful Porsche-only magazine found
at most quality newsstands, and the Porsche Market Letter, which is published
by this guy in Oklahoma and advertised in both of the above. Avoid Hemmings,
avoid DuPont -- they're aimed at the "gold-chain", "more money than sense"
crowd who (a) don't know any better and (b) think it's cool to pay a lot of
money for something because well, then it's worth a lot, right?


Stan
****************
     A few months ago a friend here in San Diego bought a 86 or
87 (I'm not sure which) 930 with about 40k miles, excellent
condition, for $28k.  He was VERY happy, and still is!

Bob
****************

Another:

If you buy a gray market car whose conversion you are not intimately
familair with (i.e. you were there and saw that it was done right),
you are FAR better off with a U.S. legal-by-Porsche 930 than ANY
conversion. There are/were a lot of schlock shops doing conversions,
so they are not all created equal.

An 86 Cabriolet should sell for 28K in mint condition, low miles.
A beater with high miles...maybe 24-25K. A cherry, outta the box 
maybe 30K. I happen to have an 86 Cab and I paid 28K last year
with 24K miles on it, and really nice condition.

I've seen 86 Turbos in my area (San Francisco Bay Area) for 34K
with low miles and near-perfect shape.  You might consider a
trip to LA or California in general to locate a car, but your location
may prohibit that. What about Florida? They always seem to have good deals
in DuPont from the zillion dealers north of Miami. There is a dealer
her who buys cars at auctions in Florida, ships them out, and sells
them for 10-20 percent below normal (whatever that is) retail. I would
have bought from him, but he couldn't find a Cab!

Subject: EARLY 911/912 HEATERS

Hi there,
I have a question regarding the heater on my 1966 912. Since
buying the car 3 years ago the heater has been pretty poor,
taking a long time to heat up, gives low temperature, and
barely defogs the windows. I am somewhat resigned to the fact
that this performance is just characteristic of this vintage of
Porsche. Can people confirm this, or suggest improvements.

Secondly, and what really promts this, is that I have seen
several advertisements for early 911/912's with "gas heaters".
I take these to be after market additions. Can anyone tell me
what these are, how they work, where they fit in the car, are
they any good, and if so where to get one.

Subject: Re: EARLY 911/912 HEATERS 

I own a 912 that I bought new in 1966.  

The heater in a 912 was poor when the car was new.  And they get 
worse in several ways:

    The flappers (look under the car) that the control-stalk moves
    to re-direct the airflow get confused by wear and road damage.

    Sometimes the control valves (also moved by the control-stalk)
    that are above the engine, before the passenger compartment (look
    for the wide spot in the round ducting) get cranky.

    The heat-exchangers that are wrapped around the exaust manifold
    get old and rusty.  This doesn't hurt your heat, but puts exhaust 
    gas into your car and convinces you to leave the heat off :-).

You can often improve the heat by watching the flapper boxes (while 
someone else moves the control) and adjusting the cables.

The gas heaters were OEM.  An option in the US market.  Where do 
they fit?  Ever wonder why the compartment below the trunk that
contains the brake fluid resevoir is so big?  They are currently 
*rare*.  Stoddard advertised *one* for sale several years ago.  

(I actually sent them the money, and they asked me to un-buy it
so that someone in a really cold climate could get it :-)  I wanted
one because my heat exchangers seemed leaky and replacing them is $$$.)

I have heard rumors that the heater in one model of VW (the 70s
square back?) is a direct replacement.

Subject: Re: Finalizing my decision.

Frank and I seem to be in violent agreement on the 944S.  So much for
spirited debate.  I think the great fear any 944S or 944 2.7 owner has
is that of owning an orphan car, ie, one made in small enough numbers
that getting parts is expensive or impossible.  So far this has not been
a problem for me, with perhaps the exception being the air filter
(expensive, but not hard to get).

It is also worth noting that a bunch of the "different" engine parts are
in fact 928 parts, eg, the valves, the rotor and cap.  However, if you
really wanted to optimise for price and availability, as well as long-
term reliability, I think getting an 85 1/2-forward aspiro 944 is the
most conservative play.

But you didn't decide to buy a Porsche because you're conservative, now,
did you?

Subject: Re: Finalizing my decision.

(Frank talks about his 944S experiences)

I also own a 87 944S (Popular year? hm...), and I prefer it to a  
stock 944. When I was looking for a Porsche last year, I drove a few  
944 types, and I was a bit unimpressed with the power curve,  
particularly at above 5K rpm. The car's power just seemed to cut out.  
I mentioned this to the sales guy, and he suggested I try a turbo. A  
bit TOO much power there for me ;-). Well, then he said "We just got  
a 944S on the lot, would you like to try that?" I gave it a run, and  
was very impressed with the mid to high RPM performance. Like my  
dad's 67 911L, the 944S did not suffer from oxygen deficiency at the  
higher RPM's, and is able to supply gobs of torque and consistent  
power all the way up to redline/cutoff. Needless to say, I bought it  
(and didn't pay any more for it than for a standard 944! :-)

Now, after owning the car for a year, I would say that I am extremely  
satisfied with it's performance and value. The car has had a few  
minor quirks, but most of the big bugaboos (the oil cooler, and the  
infamous **BELT OF DOOM**) were taken care of before I bought it. I  
think my next step is to go and get a AutoThority DME chip and see  
what kind of performance tweaking that might create.

The only thing to worry about with the 944S is the timing belt.  
Unlike the 944, in which there is clearance between the pistons and  
the valves, there isn;t such in the 944S. As a result, one will  
replace EVERY valve and R&R the head if the belt breaks. No  
ifsandsorbuts. 


As for durability, I now have about 120K miles on it, and fully  
expect it to see 250K before I need to start worrying about major  
engine work.


Hope this helps

Sure it would.  I don't think you can say that it's possible to just bolt a 924
shortblock under a 931 head and expect anything but trouble.  Having said that,
though, Porsche essentially did just this for the 81-84 Euro 931's, which had
an 8.5:1 compression ratio _and_ higher boost levels than the USA 931's.  (I
doubt they used stock 924 pistons, though).  To control detonation and other
"bad things," a DITC (Digital Ignition Timing Control) setup, which I think
was unique to 81-on 931's and GT's, had to be used.  I don't think that the
DITC could easily be retrofitted to a car that doesn't have it, but for cars
that do, the prospect of wringing ~180HP out of this motor by upping the
compression and boost is interesting.  Somehow though, I doubt it would be
quite this easy in practice.

yep.  this could be a big problem...  in the past, porsche has been very good
about maintaining stockpiles of parts for "phased out" models.  but then
again, the models they've phased out have been more popular and cheaper than
the 928...  i suspect parts will be even harder to find, and i wouldn't be at
all surprised if the cost went up some.  on the other hand, the used parts
dealers (kempton brothers, 928 international, ...) shouldn't be affected for
some time...  i'd also expect the parts common to the 944 line and the 928
should be easier to find because there are so many 944s out there.  :-)

nope.  and true to form, i plan on keeping my '80 928 for awhile.  :-)

Subject: Production cut-off dates

Greetings!

I have a question concerning production dates for porsche automobiles.
Is there a specific month of the year at which point porsche starts
manufacturing models for the next year?
 I have a 914 (production date 4/72)that has a 150 mph speedo. My
confusion arises from the fact that I read in the archives from this
group that 1973 914s came with the 150 mph speedometer. Does this mean
that my car is actually a 1973 or was the 150 speedo an option? Another
point of confusion is that I have a second 1972 914 parts car, but this
one has a 120 mph speedometer.

Thanks to anyone that can end my confusion,
Brendin Harb

Brendin,
   You are right about the fact that it was 73 and later 914's which came
with the 150mph speedo.  There was no option that I know of.  If your VIN
begins with 472 then you have a '72, if 473 you have a '73.  Built in the
month of april 72 sounds like a late in the model year '72.

The speedometer in the 914 can be changed in a matter of 2 minutes, without
removing the instrument panel.  That, with the fact that the odometer
part of the speedo breaks often, and that swap meets are loaded with
150mph speedos leads me to believe that somebody changed yours.  There
is no way to tell unless you have records of mileage and the odometer is
wrong.

   really? the cap? is the 944S a twin-plug car? wow. i would also suspect that

No, it's not twin plug but recall the 928 uses 2 caps, one for each
head on the 4 valve version. Yes, you get to do 2 tuneups for the

Except for one interesting little fact: Porsche pretty much built "car du jour"
from the founding of the company until the very late 70s. They'd have a pile of
say speedo heads sitting in some parts bin, and when they got to a certain
point in the cycle, the main parts guy would order to the next year's spec. 
And then mix the old and new parts. So when Hans or Udo went to get a speedo 
head, they might get a '72 or might get a '73. 

All of the coachbuilt cars (i.e. early 356s, the specials, and most racers)
are effectively undocumentable as a result. What went on the car? "It depends". 
Oh. I see.

Cars close to model transitions are *EXTREMELY* frustrating to authenticate.
I have a 356SC from *VERY* early in the production run (run started in July
1963, and this car showed up at the dealer in San Antonio TX on 22 August 63).
It has stuff on it that, well, shouldn't be there -- like 356B fuse block and
cover, to name one that just pops to mind.

Advice: unless you plan on doing a zillion dollar restoration and competing
for the Manhatten Trophy, don't worry too much about it so long as it works!

Subject: Re: speedo cable 


Mark,

In my experience, a broken cable is the most likely reason your speedo
and odometer quit working, and luckily, it is very easy to replace and
not expensive (about $30, according to my Tweeks catalog).  The
speedometer is run off a set of gears in and on the transmission, so
other possiblities for the failure are the speedometer gear drive that
mounts on your transmission, the speedometer itself, or the
speedometer gear inside the transmission (unlikely).

I'm guessing from your e-mail address that you are in the SF Bay area,
if so, and if it turns out that your problem is with the speedometer
itself, I recommend Palo Alto Speedometer ***VERY*** highly
(415-323-0243, 718 Emerson St., Palo Alto).  They've repaired the
speedometer on a couple of my cars and have always done an excellent
job.  They even had all the pieces needed to fix my '67 912 speedo in
stock!

Subject: 944 rod bearings


I was just reading the Feb 93 'Der Gasser' newsletter and on
page 7, Ron Pace talks about the 944 number 2 rod bearing
being a weak point on these cars (turbo and normally
aspirated). 
(Does this include the 944S also ?)

I quote- 
	"...the cause is connected with design's inability to
	maintain adequate and consistent oil film in the
	bearing journal. This is particularly evident on cars
	that get a lot of exercise on the track !"

Is this true ? 

Ron suggets using synthetic oil for its better high
temperature performance and more consistent viscosity.  
Also, he suggets installing an upgraded oil pressure relief
valve on early 87 or before models (to give more even oil
film thickness in the journals).  
And lastly he suggets changing rod bearings after 55-60 hours
at the track ! (for $600-$900 at a good shop)

Does anyone have any experience or knowledge of this 
"weak point" with number 2 rod bearing ?

Subject: Mix and match Porsches

Stan is sure correct about the way Porsche makes changes.

My 944 IT race car started life as a 1985 944.  It has pieces from  
many different years now, but before I started pulling things apart,  
it had the early 85 running gear (steel suspension, etc.), early 85  
interior (the Chevette-like one), but what appeared from the outside  
to be an 85 1/2 engine and drivetrain.  When I rebuilt the engine  
last summer, I found mix and match extended to the interior parts of  
the engine!!!

It also has an electrical harness which doesn't match _any_ of the  
wiring diagrams in the factory manuals (spent five hours one evening  
trying to figure that one out....).

Of course, what stock parts is has left are from every 944 year from  
83 through 88, as well as some from the turbo.

Nabi Rafie asks:

>Does anyone have any experience or knowledge of this 

>"weak point" with number 2 rod bearing ? [in 944s pre-87]

This is a well-known weak point of the 944 engine under high-speed  
track conditions.  At high rpms, the engine oil becomes aerated and  
an air pocket forms in a high point in the main oil gallery near the  
feed for the number 3 main bearing.  When oil pressure drops for any  
reason (say, under high lateral g-loading), this air is fed into the  
number 3 main bearing and through the crank into the number 2 rod  
bearing.  Loss of adequate oiling for the rod bearing results, and  
you end up spinning the bearing.

It's happened to me--actually about 15 minutes after I put my ITS 944  
on the track for the first time.  I personally know of three other  
944s that it has happened to at the track.  If you talk to any  
knowledgeable 944 mechanics who work on track cars, they are aware of  
the problem.

The solution?  The only perfect one is to obtain a engine block that  
doesn't have the high spot in the main oil gallery....

Less expensive fixes include:

	Synthetic oil overfilled about 1/2 - 3/4 quart
	Meticulous attention to the temperature in your engine
		(higher temp equals thinner oil results in less film
		strength)
	Installation of an Accusump (accumulates oil at high pressure
		and feeds it back to the engine when oil pressure
		drops)

None of these is foolproof, but the combination of all three seems to  
have worked for me and several others so far....

Ignoring the problem will result in bearing failures after x number  
of hours, where x is dependent upon a whole bunch of factors, many of  
them random.  Replacing the bearings prophylactically is probably a  
bad idea, as they don't gradually wear out, but instead fail  
catastrophically under a specific set of conditions.

If you only track your 944 occasionally, I would at least use  
synthetic oil, but not spend money to replace rod bearings except  
when and if they fail (you'll hear it when it happens).

This continues to this day.  For example, you see a bracket for the
power steering reservoir on some 83 944's.  Stuff gets slip-streamed all
the time.  Another example, in 87 they added an oil level warning to
the 944's.  But they added it in parts, first the sender or the dash
lamp, then other stuff to finish it.  There was specifically a tech
bulletin which said, in a bunch of words:

 a) if customer's car has no oil level sender system, tough, putting
    one in isn't warranty-work.
 b) if customer's car has some part of the system in place, see (a).

As for the concoursing/originality aficionados, yeah, you know I think
the judges really ought to understand that what the factory said about
changes as of such-and-such a VIN is not all that exact.  Somehow when
standards of "originality" gets taken further than factory originality,
it seems a little silly.

Nabi -

The received wisdom is as you say: every 50 to 70 track hours of really
thrashing the car.  I don't know who originated it, and I really don't
know whether to believe it or not.  I am quite sure that one size doesn't
fit all: if you have a souped up 951 which you stress the bejeebers out
of, you'll need to rebuild the engine/do the bottom end a lot sooner than
someone driving a stock 951 at a more gentle clip.

Bob Strange (BFG tire guy and former 944 racer) said once at Tech Tactics
that the pre-production 944S had an starvation problem which caused the
#2 bearing to go away.  I think it was due to over-agressive diversion of
oil to the top end.  Why the #2 is the most stressed in 944's is no
doubt due to nothing more mysterious than design of the case and how
oil is scavenged from it.

I'm looking for a new set of the 94mm 10.5 or 11:1 Mahle hi-dome
pistons, or Arias or Venolia copies of same. Need these suckers
ASAP, can't wait to order a set. We can machine the pockets for 
the spark plug and valves, don't need that done but will take a set
that is pre-cut. Will also consider used but in very good condition.
Will consider TRW or Cosworth too, but we'll have to talk about that...

We can either buy them from you outright or swap your set against a set we 
already have on order.

Obligatory Story With Moral: The reason I need these is we lunched an
engine in Abilene. Symptoms: car missing on one cylinder at idle on 
the grid (not unusual), spewing aluminium shavings out of one carb spigot 
(highly unusual). Best diagnosis: not good.  Shut it down, load it up, 
head home.

Tonight, we opened it up. What happened is that (a) the valves got *REAL*
tight and as a result the seats super-heated (b) this also expanded the
pockets the hardened seats were pressed into (c) when the engine heat-cycled,
the seats started floating loose in their pockets and (d) when the engine
warmed up again, the seat fell down with the valve. Made a *BIG* mess of
the combustion chamber and the top of the piston. The valve, oddly enough,
seems to be fine. We'll know for sure once it comes out of the head and
can be checked.

Moral: *ALWAYS* check your valve clearances, no matter how nasty the

etc. Is an Accusump the way to go, or are there other (less expensive,
or more expensive but better) alternatives that I should consider?

Racer's Wholesale sells the 3qt Accusump for $170 w/ a manual
valve, $260 with an electric valve (same prices for the 2qt version). I
assume that that's a reasonable price (they seem to always have `lowest

A simple case of a stiffer chassis for less weight.  The current Corvette
is a perfect example of how much more weight must be added in order to
attain a given chassis rigidity when a convert. configuration is a 
design requirement.

The Corvette if designed to be a Coupe from it's inception would tip
the scales at a lower weight than it's current revision.

The new RX-7 is probably the best example of decent rigidity at a low

I would strongly recommend NOT to do this!  Overfilling may cause the 
crank to splash in the oil, causing power loss and additional heat, 
plus it'll foam the oil that's in the pan.

Nathan / others, have you confirmed whether there's clearance between 
the crank and oil to do this?

As long as the pickup at the sump's bottom doesn't suck air, oil level 
is unimportant (Yes I know what cornering does to oil levels!).  I'd 
suggest sticking with the factory's recommended "full" level, and make 
sure you're at it.  Check you oil level during the day at the track - 
I've had mine drop 1/2 qt. in 90 track minutes.

I have heard of #2 rod bearing failures - it's real.  A guy in CVR 
(Connecticut) lost his engine when the #2 bearing failed big-time, and 
blew a hole in the block.  All your information is accurate.

I agree that Mobil 1 will help this situation.  A friend of mine with a 
300+ hp 951 who spends 30-40 days per year at the track, tore down his 
engine after 2 years and found no appreciable wear on #2 - he uses Mobil 1.

Like the owner's manual...
Which led to some anxious hours in the first full day of my 924S
ownership.  I was beginning to drive the car back to MA from NJ, 
and the oil light was blinking at me.  The manual states emphatically
that the oil warning light is not a level indicator.  The level
was down a bit, maybe 1/2-2/3 quart.  After parking in a different
spot and restarting after an errand, the light wasn't blinking,
leading me to wonder just what it was trying to tell me (maybe the
aftermarket alarm had some goofy secret tie-in to the light?).
Anyway, I eventually looked in the manual again, and noticed the
photocopied page stuck in the front that described the low level
warning system.  Then I was left to worry about whether the car
had an oil consumption problem (thankfully not, as it turns out).

It's a non-street '86, with the larger 951S turbo, Autothority Stage II 
chips, slicks, and loads of boost & inertia.  It gets torn down & 
inspected regularly, and breaks from time to time...  It has something 
like 100K+ miles, and has broken some valve springs in its life.  It 
gets "free" head gaskets every time the top is opened to poke around, 
so no gasket has been in there long enough to fail on its own.

It's lightened, has a stripped interior, cage, harnesses, and racing 
seats, ? some amount of Plexiglass and a fiberglass hood, if I'm 
up-to-date.  It gets trailered to events and can be seen in Zone 1 PCA 
racing.  It belongs to Dick Howe.

Subject: 84 944 rear hatch glass

Hi...

New person here, borrowing my spouse's computer account to gain info
on fixing his car.  We recently made the mistake of moving to Stanford,
California. :)  We are having difficulty finding a responsible, 
knowledgeable, affordable mechanic or other repair-oriented person
to fix the problem of the rear hatch glass sliding downwards (backwards,
if you prefer).  It appears that Porsche used a paint and then adhesive
to attach the glass to the frame.  Over time and use, this has 
deteriorated and there is an increasingly large gap between the glass
and the frame.  It also appears that the glass is intended to serve
as structural support for the assembly, and as the glass slides down
(again, back) the frame is beginning to bend.  I've been told by 
windshield people that this is common in Porsches (anybody else?) and
that the proper way to fix the problem is to remove the glass and start
over, but no guarantees that the glass won't break, and this particular
person won't accept that responsibility.  Now the fun part.  We don't have
a lot of extra money sitting around after Stanford gets their share. 
I am an un-employed rocket scientist, and somewhat mechanically inclined, 
so does anyone know of a way I can simply, safely, cheaply, fix this 
problem?  Any help is greatly appreciated.  By the way, this is our
family car, and the other car is my 72 914.

Pam , mommy of Irish twins Alejandra and Arianne

Uh...maybe I'm misinterpreting your message, but installing an  
Accusump is not the same as dry-sumping the engine.  An Accusump is  
simply a safety feature that normally has little or no oil flow to or  
from it.  It is essentially a pressure accumulator which supplies oil  
to the engine should oil pressure drop.  It can also store oil at  
pressure while your engine is off, then supply oil to the engine  
prior to starting, which should reduce wear (remember those Castrol  
(?) commercials).

Installing an Accusump in a 951 should be very straightforward.  You  
simply need to run a line from the Accusump to the return line of  
your oil cooler.  I'm not sure if there is clearance, but the easiest  
way may be to install a T off the oil filter manifold where the oil  
cooler return line enters the block.  Otherwise you could T off the  
middle of the line somewhere.  If you use the manual valve version,  
then the valve needs to be somewhere accessible, which probably means  
the Accusump would be somewhere on the passenger side floor (either  
behind or just in front of the seat).  Remember that the main unit  
can get somewhat hot, though....

If you use the electrically-actuated valve version, you could  
probably find a place for the Accusump in the engine compartment (oh  
yeah, it is a 951, maybe not), or someplace like one of the rear  
wheel wells.

If the Accusump is installed in the cabin, you should use Aeroquip  
line, dash 10 size or larger, which will drive the cost up somewhat.

I bought my manual 3 qt Accusump directly from Canton/Mecca (203  
481-8324) for $195 including the installation clamps and 2nd-day UPS  
shipping.  If I recall correctly, it was the same price as Racer  
Wholesale, but I prefer to deal directly with the manufacturer when  
possible.

Attention newsletter editors...


944 Exhaust Gussets

With the first 944-series cars now over ten years old, 
owners are starting to find their cars needing the kinds of 
maintenance and repair which even the best-made cars of this 
age will require.  The exhaust system is a case in point.  
The pipes are made of very high quality steel, beautifully 
welded.  Problems with it of any kind are very rare, except 
of course where an accident has physically damaged some 
part.

However, the 944's exhaust is hung from the car in only a 
small number of places.  One of the hangers is at the rear 
of the car, just after the muffler.  Since this hanger bears 
about half the weight of the whole exhaust, this design 
places quite a load on the weld seam joining the rear exhust 
pipe and tip to the muffler.  European Performance 
Engineering has seen several older 944's which have had 
breaks at this weld.

Their solution is to add a pair of simple gussets, as you 
can see in the accompanying photo.  Welding in two short 
pieces of steel flat stock, they use one to triangulate the 
lip at the bottom of the muffler with the bracket, and the 
other to triangulate the lip at the top with the rear pipe.  
The welding has to be done with the exhaust off the car.  
Given the small number of hangers, getting it off is of 
course pretty quick!

After welding, the flat stock and weld seams should be 
sealed with a good coat of paint.  The whole operation can 
be done by any good mechanic in well under an hour.


Alarm Locks

I had a problem with my car's factory alarm lock freezing in 
cold weather.  There is a black plastic "gate" in the key 
slot, whose job it is to slide back and forth, sealing the 
slot and the lock mechanism from the elements when the key 
is removed.  The gate was not blocking my car's key slot, 
and that let water in which would freeze.

The cause turned out to be pretty simple.  After six years 
of continuous use, I had tapped the metal face of the lock 
enough times to bend it in ever so slightly around the edges 
of the key slot.  The slight bend on two edges of the slot 
was enough to keep the gate from travelling freely.  A few 
minutes gently prying back the metal face with a jeweller's 
screwdriver, and the problem was solved.

I would recommend using a good lubricant in the lock 
mechanism, one which will inhibit entry of water.  Using a 
"lock de-icer" spray or liquid, which is typically alcohol-
based, very effectively removes any lubricants in the lock, 
almost guaranteeing that the lock with freeze right up 
again.

Porsche has a jelly lubricant for door and alarm locks, part 
number 999.917.751.00, and a ten gram tube of it lists for 
$1.50.   Good stuff, but I wish they had thought through the 
applicator a bit better.  The neck of the tube really isn't 
thin enough to get deep into a lock.  I tamped the jelly 
into my alarm lock by breaking a Q-tip in half and using the 
shaft.  A wooden coffee stirrer would probably work too.  I 
like Porsche's jelly better than spray lubricants because it 
creates a better barrier to moisture.

By the way, when you wash your Porsche in cold weather (or 
any car for that matter), putting a small square of duct 
tape over each key slot will help keep water out of them.

Tech Tactics 13

Tech Tactics took place this year under threat of the 
monstrous snowstorm which rolled in on Saturday, March 13th.  
I guess this might have scared some people away at the last 
moment.  However, for myself and no doubt many others, the 
thought of being snowed into a rather nice hotel with a 
great supply of German beer and a bunch of folks who like 
nothing better than to talk Porsches was not unappealing!

The weekend started Friday with a pleasant after-work drive 
from Boston to Springfield, arriving in time to meet up with 
folks in the hospitality suite sponsored by Toyo Tires.  I 
wasted no time in cornering our National Tech Chair, Bruce 
Anderson.  I had hoped he might shed some light on a subject 
of great personal mystery:  Why in mid-year 1975 did Porsche 
swap the locating tab in the main bearing saddles from one 
side of the case to another?  Bruce couldn't answer this 
one, and I'll bet no one outside the factory knows. (Howard: 
can you use this one?)  Trivial, sure, but you know there 
had to be a reason.  I am cursed with a reductionist mind, I 
guess.

Tech Tactics proper began Saturday morning with an 
introduction from co-chair Linda Goodman.  The event is run 
very much like, for example, a professional conference.  
Speakers get up in front of a room full of people, and with 
the help of overhead and slide projectors, present a talk on 
some given subject.  First up this year was John Paterek 
with a talk devoted to the top ten questions asked of him as 
a preparer of national-level concours-winning cars.  The 
first question was how to seal the underside of a 356.  I'm 
not sure what the other nine questions were, because from 
there John went into a fascinating slide show detailing the 
problems, solutions, and final results of work on a number 
of very interesting cars his shop has seen over the last 
twelve months.  And as usual, John brought us up to date on 
his favorite products for car restoration and cleaning.  The 
Wurth company's products seem to have been a big hit with 
him recently.

Terry Zacone then filled us in on why "Your Porsche was Born 
to Autocross."  I agree with him on this one, but does 
anyone know the German word for "autocross?"  Is there one?  
Terry's #1 rule is: Be smooth.  Drive with strength.  His 
three determinants of success are preparation, practice, and 
aggressiveness.  And as for what the experts know and use 
that beginners do not, he lists throttle steering, trail 
braking, and the use of first gear.

Next up was Jim Newton with a talk of 915 gearboxes.  The 
915 gearbox is the one used on non-turbo 911-series Porsches 
from model year '72 through '86.  We had a chance to see the 
915 up close because both Jim and the folks from Bodymotion 
brought along demonstration gearboxes, with the case cut out 
to reveal the inner workings.  Things I learned: Jim 
believes that 80% of 915 gearboxes suffer from a loose 
pinion shaft bearing.  There are a couple of cures, 
depending on the degree of wear, which will restore the 
interference fit.  Either plate the bearing, or in more 
severe situations, machine the case and insert an aluminum 
sleeve.  Jim also pointed out that the sticky tires we use 
nowadays at the track place tremendous loads on these 
gearboxes.  Titanium, anyone?  He ended his talk with some 
very sensible suggestions on shifting style, designed to 
both improve your performance and preserve your gearbox.

The afternoon sessions incorporated a new twist for this 
year: parallel tracks.  In one room, Pete Tremper gave what 
I am told was an excellent talk on car paint, the 5 mils we 
spend so much time trying to preserve.  He was followed by 
Dan Petchel, who breathed hope into the hearts of those 
undertaking their own restoration projects.

I opted for Bob White's talk on zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) 
technologies.  Bob teaches at a college in Michigan, and he 
and his students are involved in various research projects 
with auto manufacturers and the government.  He brought 
along some hard numbers and facts on the state-of-the-art in 
ZEV: what works and what doesn't.  I read a great quote 
recently, defining politics as the conflict between values 
and interests, and it certainly applies to the politics 
surrounding the automotive world.  However, the news is far 
from all bad for car lovers.  Some of these electric- and 
alternative-fuel things look like they'll not only work, but 
might even be a lot of fun.  Autocrossers: how about a car 
which develops maximum torque at zero RPM?

Bruce Anderson surprised us with a talk which had absolutely 
nothing to do with, oh, main bearing locating tabs.  His 
brother Clark was involved in the preparation of two 1954 
356's which ran in the last Carrera Panamericana event down 
in Mexico.  Bruce was invited to watch the running of the 
event, and returned with a bushel of slides.  I doubt Bruce 
got away without turning a few wrenches as well.

Saturday ended with the traditional "Tire Guys" panel.  Many 
of you aficionados of sticky tires are probably aware of 
Bridgestone's withdrawal from the market.  The quadrumvirate 
this year consisted of representatives from BF Goodrich, 
Pirelli, Toyo, and Yokohama.  All four have interesting new 
products.

Sunday kicked off with PCNA part rep. Bill Baxter.  Bill 
lives close by, and was able to drive his C2 through the 
snow from home to the hotel that morning.  In fact, he was 
so brave as to raffle off rides in it to three lucky 
attendees.  We got to see Porsche's Boxster video, which 
gives a very interesting tour through the construction of 
the Boxster prototype.  I was impressed most by the amazing 
amount of human effort which went into creating just the 
prototype.  Next time I feel kind of proud of myself for 
having spent time crafting one silly little widget for my 
car, I am sure I will reflect on just how much creative time 
and energy people the Factory put into making and assembling 
all its brethren into the finished, handsome product which 
sits in my garage.

Bill brought us up to date on new models we'll see from 
Porsche over the next few years.  In particular, the 986 
will incorporate much of the Boxster prototype's exterior 
design, but probably not much if its rather more fanciful 
interior.

Our one loss to the snowstorm was Bob Russo, who was to have 
talked on "Sensible Techniques for High-Speed Driving."  Too 
bad; after his years of involvement with Holbert Racing and 
now with the PCA Racing series, I was really looking forward 
to Bob's talk.  Hopefully next year.  In its place, Jim 
Newton, Bob White, and Terry Zacone put together an 
impromptu talk on the next steps someone might take after 
getting hooked on autocrossing or track events.  I think the 
keyword "sensible" was very much in mind here, and their 
suggestions were well thought out.

As we do every year, the week-end ended with a Question & 
Answer panel composed of all the speakers.  We also were 
given the chance to acknowledge and thank Linda Goodman and 
Eric Grossman for their five years of chairing Tech Tactics.  
Putting together an event like this is no easy task, and we 
owe them many thanks for the terrific job they've done.

I've been running my 944 overfilled 1/2 - 3/4 qt with Mobil 1 since I  
finished rebuilding the engine last summer.  Since the rebuild, the  
engine has seen probably 30+ hours of track time.  I did check the crank  
to oil level clearance when I had the engine apart....I feel entirely  
safe with the hot level about 6 - 10 mm above the "full" line.  Even with  
the scraper and baffle found in later 944s, I can confirm that the oil  
pickup can become exposed under high-G cornering....overfilling slightly  
and using an Accusump prevent this from being disastrous.

You drive a 951, don't you Jim?  It doesn't seem that normally-aspirated  
944s have the oil consumption characteristics of the turbos, but it is  
good advice to check your oil level before and after every session....

In the way-back-when, there used to be trailer hitch kits you could get for
914s (and 911s for that matter!). It's been a *LONG* time since I've seen
one, but if I'm remembering right, there were two pieces of metal that went
across the car side-to-side, sort of C-shaped to make them be the same 
height from the ground. One went from outer motor mount to outer motor mount,
one went from transmission mount to transmission mount (this is the one with
the "deepest" C-shape, as it had to come down further. Then there were two
pieces of metal that welded to these, running fore-and-aft, to which the
bar with the trailer ball bolted. Pretty Rube-Goldberg, but it worked --
or at least sort of worked.

>Any ideas would be welcome.  Thanks.

I'd suggest digging up an *OLD* aftermarket catalog (Performance Products
used to carry these for sure, about 10 years ago or more) and seeing if
you can find a picture. Maybe an old Pano as well, but I'd expect something
like that to make it into an Upfixin' volume. In any event, check the

My 87 944S uses considerable oil on the track (sometines more than 1 Qt
a day (~1 hour of track time). Of course I check it every run group,
and it has used as much as 1/2 Qt. in one 20 min. run group. On other
run groups (with roughly equal driving intensity) it uses very little.
It uses little if any oil in street driving, from what I can tell.
Since my car uses oil on the track, I have tried to survey other 944 and
944S owners on their oil usage. From what I can tell, some use a lot,
some use a little, and some use almost none. This seems to be true for
early and late 944's, 944S, and 951. I called Autoathority (in Va.),
since they maintain many tracked 944's, and they made essentially the
same comment (some do, some don't). I did find one person in Pa. who
claimed there was a manufacturing defect with the piston rings in some
944S which made them use more oil under high HP output conditions,
but I also found many 944 and 951 owners with high track oil usage.
Up until now I have been keeping it full but not overfull, but I may
try overfilling, since I don't like the idea of running 1/2 Qt. down
at the end of a "bad" run group.

Does anyone other than Nathan have data supporting or not supporting
overfilling, and by how much?

Also, someone mentioned that the #2 bearing problem relates to the shape
of the main oil gallery. Is there a fix?

Yah, I have a 951.  Frank Kerfoot's response pretty much says it all -

Subject: std vs gas(oline) heat

If I recall, there was a posting of late re the why's and wherefore's of gas
heaters and about the symtomatic problems of the standard 912 heater system.
Here's what I've learned and observed about these parts over the years. 

Gas heaters for the early 911/912 were made by Webasto and from all indications
appear to be factory options, although I have some original '67 911S sales
literature listing the heater as standard for that model. As a factory option,
it must have been very popular because every '67 911S I've seen has one. In any
event, I have talked to some folks who've used them and thought they were
great. My understanding of the basic process is that they got their supply of
gasoline from the fuel tank which fed a little burner positioned down in a
small compartment between the tank and the passenger compartment. Once started
(by electrical charge I believe) a blower routed the heated air out a grated
vent positioned center floor rear. An overflow/condensation tube came down from
the burner and ran along the passenger rocker panel opening near the torsion
bar cover.

The benefit of this heater is that it isn't dependent upon the engine running
at all, much less at a sufficient operating temperature to generate heat. Also,
there's fewer moving parts with corresponding less probability of failure.
Eberspacher (sp?) is another company that made them for 356's and VW's. In
fact, somewhere I have information on someone who specializes in servicing
these devices for the VW community. Typically, service facilities like this
also have available for sale the parts they service. So if there's interest out
there, I'm sure I can dig it up. 

Regarding the 912 heater boxes, make sure they aren't rusted through,
straighten the sheet metal, and try to adjust all the 'monkey motion' out of
the series of levers, springs, valves, flappers, etc. If all that fails, I have
a complete assembly in very good condition buried somewhere in one of my parts
boxes that I can be persuaded to part with. 

Hope that helps some.

When the front wheel bearings are properly adjusted on a 911/914 there
is a *very* small amount of "play" in the bearing. You can feel this
if you grasp the top edge of the tire and shake it towards you and
away from you with the car on the ground. This is the typical method
to inspect bearings at a PCA on-track tech inspection.

The main spindle nut (the one with the allen head bolt used to lock
it in place) is used to adjust the bearing. As you tighten this
nut the bearing play will decrease. The factory procedure for
adjusting the front bearing is to first "seat" the bearing with
a fair amount of torque, say 20-30 ft-lbs and then back off until
the washer under the spindle nut *just* begins to slide under the
spindle nut with slight pressure from the tip of a screwdriver. If 
everything is in good shape then the bearing *will* have a small
amount of play. Sorry for the vagueness of some of this, but I just
don't have any quantifiable numbers to measure this.

With a good bearing you will definately be able to remove *all* play
in the bearing by simply overtorquing the bearing spindle nut. But
you should avoid the temptation to do this because it will lead to
premature failure of the bearing.

Since you say you cannot even remove this play in your bearings then
it sounds like they are worn out. 

If you need to replace get the OEM FAG bearing available everywhere
and quite inexpensive. Make sure you get both inner and outer and the
seals also.

Not sure about the old fuel but you might want to check the fuel
pressure. Assuming the hydrocarbons are OK then high fuel pressure
can lead to slightly rich idle. The adjustment is a screw on the
fuel pressure regulator. 

Also, you might check the head temperature sensor. If its not
functioning (corroded connector perhaps) then the fuel injuection
brain will never get a signal that the engine is warm and you'll
be running with cold-enrichment at all times.

These are two quick checks to make as a start.

I suspect that the problem is spindle wear. This happened significantly
on my old 67 911S, and to some extent on my 914-2.0. If the inner race
of either or both of the roller bearings is not a tight fit on the
spindle, then there is play which you cannot remove by longitudinally
compressing the bearings (i.e.the adjustment nut), which just takes
the play out of the tapered bearings themselves. Even a few thousandths
of play feels significant, due to the large ratio between the wheel
diameter and the spacing between the bearings (~10:1). Feel with your
fingernail (a remarkably sensitive neasurement tool) along the bottom
of the spindle surface where the bearing rides, feeling for a small
step between the worn area and the unworn part. Measure the difference 
with a micrometer, if you have one, but the fingernail will diagnose
the basic problem. There will likely be more wear on the outer bearing
than the inner, due to the smaller surface area.

As far as fixes, replacing the bearing won't help. They are extremely
hard, and virtually all of the wear is on the spindle. New spindles
(e.g. new struts) is the obvious, if expensive, solution. I tried
Locktite Stud and Bearing mount (270, if I recall) on the 911S,
and that worked. They become unadjustable, so get it right before
the Locktite sets. Disassembly becomes more difficult- I used a
puller, but heat (~400 deg. F) will also make the Locktite give up.
You may want to explore metal spraying and regrinding, but I would
guess that is unrealistic unless you can find someone who has set up
to do it. There does appear to be a market, so some shop may have done
it, but I don't know who.

Before I installed an Accusump, I thought I noticed the oil pressure dropping  
in some corners during a test day at NHIS.  Unfortunately, given the stock  
location of the oil pressure gauge in early 944s (in the center console), it  
was difficult to pay attention to the oil pressure and keep the car on the  
track, at least at the speeds necessary for the phenomenon to occur.  So, I  
found a foolhardy individual to ride with me for a few laps with his eyes  
glued to the oil pressure gauge.  The pressure would drop to 0 bar in turn 6  
and sometimes would drop on the banked oval and in turn 3.  The pan was  
filled to just the "full" mark with non-synthetic multigrade oil.

Overfilling with Mobil 1 5W30 seemed to make the problem go away, though when  
I and my major sponsor drove the car at a PCA driver's ed at Mont Tremblant,  
we thought we saw the oil pressure drop in a couple of the high-g turns,  
though neither he nor I are 100% certain of that.  In any case, we've since  
installed an Accusump.

That extreme a drop in oil pressure, when the engine is revving at between  
5000 and 7000 rpm, indicates to me that the oil pump is sucking air....

By the way, my car has the later oil pan with the scraper and baffle....

Just a another note on accusumps.

Although not on a Porsche, I have run an accusump on my vintage race
mini for 3 years.  It increases my oil capacity from 5 to 8 quarts
which I believe is a strong benefit, regardless of preventing oil
starvation.  I bought the unit due to the long high speed carousel
at Road America and other similar corners, which would tend to pull
the oil from the pickup.

It is also nice to have full oil pressure before I hit the starter
button.  I have not noticed the accusump getting all that warm
during a session.  I also have the check valve sold by accusump
which is installed on the T fitting and lets only filtered oil coming
out of the cooler into the accusump.  One hint, pressurize the
accusump gradually after an oil change or it will take a while to
get oil pressure on your guage. (this is only possible with the manual
version).

Several friends of mine who race 356s all use accusumps and they
definitely prevent oil starvation on those cars.

I don't think the problem is so much finding someone to do the metal
spraying, as the following grinding operation which (I presume) is
required.
For a simple cylindrical part like the pinion bearing race, it would be
reasonably easy to grind it in a general purpose lathe with a tool post
grinder, something most machine shops could do. The spindle, attached
to the strut, cannot be turned (unless you have about a 3 foot diam.
lathe), and so something clever is required.

Having said all that, Jim Newton is a good person to contact, as
someone who probably sees a number of worn spindles, and may have found
someone who can deal with them. However, the same could be said of a
large number of specialty Porsche shops all over the country (oops,
all over the world)

for over a year now, i have lamented over the fact that both windows

down.  the driver's window was so difficult that it took two hands:
one to turn the crank, and the other to press down on the rear of 
the glass.  apparently the regulator was pulling down too much
on the forward part of the glass, which rotated the glass and 
caused it to bind in the tracks.

last year, i replaced the worn felt window channel and greased
all joints/surfaces in the window regulator, but to no avail.

last weekend, i pulled the upholstery off one more time and, after
about an hour of tinkering, found that the regulator geometry (in
terms of balancing the pull equally on the front and rear of
the glass simultaneously) is adjustable.  feeling around the
various pivots on the regulator mechanism, i felt the flats of
a 13mm nut and, upon removal of the nut, discovered the adjustment
mechanism.

As long as we're talking about struts here, are there any good sources
for struts with decambered spindles?

For those out there who haven't heard of this, it's a way to get more 
negative camber than the relatively wimpy amount you can dial in without
modifying the inner fender wall -- you can slot the adjustment holes all
you want, but if the strut bumps on the inner fender wall, you just can't
slide it over any more... Anyway, for struts who have had this done,
you start off with -3 degrees or so at what would have been zero on a
stock strut.

I understand the proceedure involves some sectioning and rewelding of the
strut mount point for the spindle, and may involve some modifications to
the steering arm to correct for steering differences. 

Thanks,

Stan

Subject: Squeaky 1986 Carrera


   To make a long story short, my 1986 Carrera Cab squeaks -- a lot.
   If I push down on any corner, it creaks going down, and creaks
   coming back up. It seems to occur on all 4 corners of the
   car. My mechanic says there's nothing I can do about it, but
   he doesn't know for sure what it the cause is -- but then again he's
   an engine guy. Anyone have any ideas on how to alleviate this annoyance?

Among other things it might be the struts. Bilsteins are notoriously
noisy and tend to creak and groan. Even brand new ones can do this.

Subject: Tach testing.


	   I have a 914 with a dead Tach. What are some things that I can do
   to test if the tach is dead or just the line betweeen the coil and the
   tach is bad. Could I put a voltmeter on the coil and see what output I get
   as I rev the engine. And then check the value at the tach? 

The tach wire runs off the coil at terminal one (1)?? This is the 
terminal that is grounded by the points to fire the coil. There
is no "voltage" to read from there. Check to see if the gauge
is getting power in the dash (12V) or maybe the tach wire is
broken.

In other words, the tach gets essentially two inputs:

a) a constant 12V from the dash to power the unit.
b) a pulse from the coil (terminal 1??).The frequency of these
	pulses determines the rpm at the gauge.

I seem to recollect that Mike Bavaro (owner of Bodymotion, Ocean, NJ,
908-493-2700) may have done something like this on one of his 911 based
race cars. Mike's shop does a lot of specialty Porsche work, including
supporting some PCA race cars and a lot of PCA "driving school junkies".
I would try him. Another East coast possibility would be Autothority in
Fairfax, Va. (no phone number handy). They also support a lot of these
cars. Also, Jim Newton's shop in Conn. (no town or phone handy) supports
many track cars. Sorry I can't help you with shops closer to Texas.

I have a 79 928 which has been behaving extremely strangely.  Since I bought
it (approximately a year ago), it ran with the temperature needle 
halfway between the 1/2 and 3/4 mark.  Then, last month I flushed the
coolant and put in a 50:50 coolant:water mixture.  The operating temperature
went up to the 3/4 mark.  Over the last week I have drained the coolant
1/8 of a quart at a time and replaced with water.  The operating temperature

Subject: 911/912 window regulator adjustment

i'm getting so many requests for drawings, etc., that i'll just
verbalize the procedure here.  i'm surprised to hear that this
is such a common problem...

i don't know what years of manufacture this may apply to; mine
is a '69 912.  your mileage may vary...

1. remove map pockets, window crank, arm rest, and anything else
   in the way of the upholstery panel.

2. remove the upholstery panel itself; be careful: the backing may
   be very brittle and/or cracked from previous work.

3. inspect the window felt all the way to the bottom of the channel.
   replace it if it is badly worn.

4. roll the window up and down, observing moving parts; liberally
   grease all contacting surfaces.

   if steps 3 and 4 do not yield satisfactory results, proceed at
   your own risk (jaws music here)...

5. roll the window up/down into a middle position, so that the regulator
   arms are visible through the large access hole near the door locking
   mechanism.  feel around the back of the arms; you should find a
   13mm nut on the back (the rest are all rivets).  loosening this
   nut and moving the arm back and forth in the adjacent bracket
   serves to adjust the angle of the base of the glass relative to
   horizontal.  if your window binds in such a fashion that pushing
   up or down on the front or rear of the window makes it move
   easier, then this adjustment might be needed.  just in case, though,
   MARK THE PRESENT POSITION OF THE ARM IN THE BRACKET BEFORE
   ATTEMPTING ANY ADJUSTMENTS! (i did not do this, so i can't be sure
   how far i actually moved the arm in the bracket.  full travel is
   about 3/4", and i don't think i moved it more than 1/4").

6. there may be other adjustments here that i have not discovered that
   may be crucial to any individual; in my case, the above proved
   successful.

it's *so* unreal being able to gently roll the driver's side window
down with _one_ _hand_ and so little effort.

Don't know about where the needle should be on your 928, but I can answer
your other question.  Water is a much better conductor of heat than
anti-freeze (ethylene-glycol).  The antifreeze will merely lower the
freezing point and raise the boiling point of the mixture, but for cooling
purposes, more water is better.  Unless you live in an extremely cold
climate, 50:50 is probably way overkill . . .

Subject: Gaskets, Guages and Window Regulators (911)


Hello all,
	I've saved up a few questions and a response - saving net traffic and
all that - and present them here.  Any and all responses will be much 
appreciated.

	First off, I have a very early '68 911S (11800070, July '67) which
was purchased in Germany and then exported as a '67.  Are there others who 
have '118' series 911S's in North America?  I'm wondering if there are parts
differences from '67 to '68 ('A' series 911) which are specific to the 'S',
as opposed to the slightly revised front suspension, 11 stud lower cam covers
and other changes that were common across the range.

	Second, I've got a blown head gasket on #4.  (assorted swear words).
The engine is quite fresh and I'm somewhat poor so I'm only going to fix
the problem and not do anything else while the engine is apart.  I haven't
had the engine apart yet, but have had it out a couple times and have had the
ancillaries off.  From reading the shop manual, it doesn't look like there are
any tricks to it.  (correct me if I'm wrong).  I have located and ordered all
the gaskets and seals, except:  Is there a gasket (or three gaskets) between
the cam housing and the cylinder heads?  Or are the only 'holes' covered
by the external oil feed lines, oil return tubes, and valve guides/seals?

	How do you remove the bezels and glass from VDO guages?  Mine need
cleaning in behind the glass but I can't get the bezels off. I figure they
either snap on over the rim of the guage or they thread on, but neither
method seems correct - however, I haven't tried too hard for fear of 
wrecking something.

	Lastly, regarding the window regulators for 911s and 912s, it is 
actually possible to assemble the window with the regulator in backwards!
My car was broken into just after I bought it and I let the shop change the
glass.  When I picked it up, they said they had a heck of a time getting the
window to wind smoothly but blamed it on old age and maybe a bent regulator.
I tore it apart and found that they had it in backwards, creating a lot of
tension and incorrect movement.

I assume you're talking about the copper gasket between the barrel and
the case.  Not be be a nag, but they typically fail as a result of not
warming the car up properly before thrashing it.  I have seen cars with
this failure for this sort of reason - it's ugly and depressing.  The
different engine parts have different rates of thermal expansion, and if
you use the car heavily before everything is nice and warm and has expanded
to "operating dimensions," you risk blowing out this gasket in particular.

No, there is no gasket between the barrel and the cam housing.  Clean the
surfaces really well (razor blade), then re-seal with orange Loctite when
you reassemble.

No idea about VDO gauge disassembly.  I would consider letting North
Hollywood Spedometer do the work.  Never had them service stuff for me,
but I have bought from them and found them friendly and helpful.

I asked my friend the Bosch mechanic about getting your DME fixed.  He
says that Bosch does not repair the units.  They sell you a new one.  And
there is not even a core charge available.

He asked what was up with your DME, and when I explained it to him, he
expressed real doubt that a bad idle would be due to the DME of all
things.  To quote him pretty much verbatim, the DME's fail very, very
infrequently (absent abuse), and when they do, they just stop running
the motor, period (rather than poor/no idle).

If he had your car, he'd look elsewhere for the problem, despite your
experience with swapping the DME.  In particular, he suggested looking at
the circuit controlling the idle stabilizer.

Hope this helps...  good luck.

Despite what someone (sorry, forgotten who) wrote about water being a
better conductor of heat, the anti-freeze/water mixture isn't the key
to your problem.  I would first suspect the thermostat, which is a
device which opens when warm to allow coolant to flow through the
radiator.  The workshop manual shows a simple procedure for checking
it, and it is an inexpensive part to replace.

I would next look at the radiator itself, to make sure that it is not
clogged and is flowing coolant adequately.

I have a contrary veiwpoint:  Bad idle due to DME is relatively common
in real practice.  I know of at least 2 such failures on 944s.

The bezels are rolled on. That is, the metal is bent around the lip of
the case, uniformly around the diameter of the bezel. If you are very
careful, you can gently pry up the back edge, a little at a time, moving
around the circumference, and remove the bezel. When you put it back,
you will not be able to restore the original rolled edge (without
special equipment), but the bezel will stay on (at least it did on my
67 911S). It won't win a concourse when you are done, unless you can
do it more neatly than I did, but I would expect that no one would notice
it unless they were looking for a problem.

In my case I had to dismantle the speedometer, since the odometer was
introducing a time-varying drag which made the speedometer needle
bounce (I disabled the odometer- I hope the statute of limitations has
expired- actually, the car's new owner knows all about it).

Also when you refill the coolant you have to bleed the air pockets
out of the cooling system. If you don't then you will get erratic
temperature readings. Bleeding is either done with a bleeder valve
in the head (high point of the cooling system) or by manually
disconnecting a hose and "burping" the air out.

If they're like the 924 gauges, the bezel snaps over the rim.  I had my
speedometer apart on the 931 a few times - a previous owner had been in
there previously and got the bezel off by prying it a bit at a time with
a screwdriver.  This left the back of the bezel pretty ugly, though the
front was largely unaffected.  I suspect that the speedometer shops have
a tool that bends out the entire back side of the bezel at once (and
therefore evenly) and another one to press it back in when reassembling.

Subject: 944 Bad Idle

I was just through the famous '944 Bad Idle' problem last week.  I have 
a few contacts at the local Porsche garage and they said that almost 
always a bad idle on a 944 is caused by a faulty 'Idle Control Valve'.  
This is especially true if the 'badness' of the idle is intermittent 
(i.e. sometimes it is OK, other times it is bad).  This is the same 
advise I received from a number of you in the 'Proschephiles' world.

Well anyway, to make a long story short....

Advise from all sources suggested removing the 'Idle Control Valve' 
and either cleaning the crud out of it or replacing it.  The rub in 
doing this is that the 'Idle Control Valve' is underneath the
intake manifold.  The top of the valve is plainly visible, but 
on the 944-S at least, there is no getting to it.  I took the intake 
manifold off and removed the valve.  I cleaned it out with carburetor 
cleaner.  With the valve off of the car you can see into the valve body 
and view the baffle that regulates the amount of air bled into the intake 
manifold.  One problem is that you can only clean the 'current' position 
of the valve.  The baffle does not rotate freely.  If there is crud 
hidden from view (the likely case) then it will still be in there when you 
reassemble everything.  It might be possible to connect +12 volts to 
either of the connections to use the motor built into the valve to 
turn the baffle, but I was hesitant to risk this.  

Once the car was back together again, it ran much better, but not perfect.
I wanted to clean the valve better but I did not want to tear it apart 
again.  After a little thought, this is what I came up with, and hence the 
purpose of this long letter.  The inlet to the 'Idle Control Valve'  is a 
hose that connects to the air tube after the filter box, but before the 
throttle blades.  By disconnecting this hose it is possible to spray 
carburetor cleaner into the inlet hose of the 'Idle Control Valve'  
while the engine is running.  By taching up the motor and letting it 
come back to idle I could detect different amounts of air being bled by the 
'Idle Control Valve' so I knew it was moving the baffle some what.  
By having the motor running you get to clean the valve in operation.  
The only down side to doing this is that the engine has to burn the 
carburetor cleaner and gunk it removes...  Oh Well...  That will teach 
it to mess with me!  It saved me a lot of work ripping the Intake manifold 
off a second time.  My car idles perfect now...

Hi Peter. Several years ago I replaced the pistons and cylinders, had
the valves ground, etc., on my '66 911. On startup the engine leaked
oil so badly I had it towed to a shop (Garretson's in Mountain View.)
They said that when they reassemble engines they use a lot of liquid
sealer (don't recall the brand name) to ensure no oil leaks. Maybe they
were being kind and not telling my I had left out a gasket or something
dumb like that. My advice is to find out what the pros do so you don't
repeat my experience. Perhaps someone will post more information on
this.

If memory serves, the instrument clusters are held in place with flat
C-shaped clamps a la the 356s. Access the back of the instrument panel
from the luggage compartment, remove a couple of serrated cylindrical
nuts on the clamp, and the gauge should come out through the front of
the dash.

I recommend you don't mess with them, unless they're so dirty, you can't read
them. When it comes to instruments, "if they ain't broke, don't fix them". The
bezels get 'boogered' up too easily with standard workshop tools. It's my
understanding that the instrument guys do use special tools to remove/replace
the bezels. For general repair, North Hollywood Speedo and Palo Alto Speedo do
good work, but IMHO they're too expensive (but I suppose California rent and
display ads in Pano and Excellence ain't cheap). There's nothing special about
VDO instruments; they're OEM on many European cars and any good instrument shop
can fix them. For good, reasonably priced instrument repair I recommend John

Some more info.

On the 911 2.0L, there is a copper gasket at the bottom of the barrel to
case and there IS a metalized gasket between the head and top of barrel. 
There is no gasket between the top of the heads and the camshaft housing. 

I doubt if the copper gasket at the bottom of the barrel is a problem.
It is only seeing crankcase blow-by pressures.  If it failed
probably only more oil would leak out.  It should have no effect on
engine operation. 

The top head to cylinder gasket can fail.  The design was changed in 1970 to
a circular spring+ring similar to a piston oil control ring.  This
is not retrofittable to the 2.0L piston cylinder, however.

If the gasket has failed and the head sealing surface is damaged, then
you may be able to resurface the sealing surface on the head.  All
three heads on the side must be done to keep the camshaft from
binding in the cam housing.

There is no gasket between the three heads and the camshaft housing.
Loctite or a Flourosilicone Dow-Corning 571? is recommended.
I'm not sure of the the Dow-Corning part number, but the stuff costs
more than $50.00 a tube.

I've seen pictures where the entire head/camshaft assembly is removed
as a unit.  This would give you access to the head gaskets and could save a 
lot of time since you would not disturb the cam housing to head sealing 
surface and do not have to remove the rockers.   

My experience is with complete tear-downs so I can't vouch for this method.

Porsche 911 engines have never used a head gasket. The head/cylinder
joining is to be assembled *dry* on all years. The joining between the
head/cam housing is coated with sealer. I like Kuril non-hardening
but some engine builders swear by the Loctite anearobic sealing
compounds. Loctite makes a special sealer for air-cooled engine
cases which looks pretty good.

The joining between the case/cylinder is a different story. There is a
gasket here for all years up until '84 Carrera. Through '69 there is
a paper gasket, from '70-'83 there is the copper sealing ring and 
Carreras use *no* gasket. I don't know about Carrera 2/4 engines (3.6).
(anyone care to shed some light?)

So, back to your '68, it should use a paper gasket between the case
and cylinder, nothing (dry) between the cylinder and head, and sealer
between the head and cam housing. Have fun!

I asked my friend the Bosch mechanic about getting your DME fixed.  He
says that Bosch does not repair the units.  They sell you a new one.  And
there is not even a core charge available.

He asked what was up with your DME, and when I explained it to him, he
expressed real doubt that a bad idle would be due to the DME of all
things.  To quote him pretty much verbatim, the DME's fail very, very
infrequently (absent abuse), and when they do, they just stop running
the motor, period (rather than poor/no idle).

If he had your car, he'd look elsewhere for the problem, despite your
experience with swapping the DME.  In particular, he suggested looking at
the circuit controlling the idle stabilizer.

Hope this helps...  good luck.

Kevin

I agree with Steve.  I currently have this problem with my 951.
In a 944/951, the idle circuit is a three wire circuit.  One of the
wires is 12v, the other two go to the DME one for open and one for
close.  With a VOM measure the resistance from the connector at the
stabilizer going back to the DME.  On mine, the bad side showed about
2 ohms.  The driver transistor in the DME had shorted.

The dealer wanted $720 for a refurbished DME with a $50 core charge.
No returns on electrical parts.  PAP wanted $400 for a used one, no
guarantee.

If you or a friend know electronics, you can buy a similar replacement 
transistor for a few bucks, and solder it in yourself.  You don't have 
much to lose if the box is already declared "dead".

The transistor is either NPN or PNP, and has some voltage / current 
rating - just make sure the replacment can fulfill the job, and you're 
all set.  Since this is basically DC, you needn't worry about bandwidth 
or such.

Thanks for the mail traffic on my questions.  Much appreciated as 
always.  Some additional clarification and questions:

>Second, I've got a blown head gasket on #4.  (assorted swear words).

Yes, I mean the head gasket between the head and barrel.  More accurately
though, I should say that I have a significant compression leak (60% pressure
compared to other cylinders) on this cylinder which can be heard and isn't 
caused by an overly tight exhaust valve. The engine runs pretty well actually 
so I'm assuming we're not looking at a bent valve or similar more serious 
problem.  It is quite possible that the sealing surface on the head is bad and
that it isn't the gasket's fault.  One person told me the gasket is really only
a secondary sealing device, though I don't know if this is true.  (Yes, this 
car is driven hard and autocrossed regularly).

>>If the gasket has failed and the head sealing surface is damaged, then
>>you may be able to resurface the sealing surface on the head.  All

Do I have to assume the head sealing surface is damaged and that machining is
required?  Can it be checked prior to machining?  

Wouldn't machining the three heads on one side up the compression ratio on 
those cylinders, or are we talking really small percentages?  Lastly, could
machining one or three heads be countered with an extra cylinder base gasket
or is this getting a too 'Mickey Mouse'?

Yes, the shop manual says removing all three heads at once with cam housing 
attached is faster and easier, and if I have to do all three then that is 
how I will remove them.

Netters,

I have a 71T with a flakey oil level sender.  It looks as though it

is this simply a matter of removing the left rear wheel and swapping
the sender? (I'll probably want to do it during an oil change so as to 
have an empty tank).

Also, (though I'm almost afraid to post this as I sent a similar post

was swapped with a 22 gal one by the previous owner.  I suspect that it
still has the original sender as it starts to read empty after around
14-15 gals are burned.  Does anyone know if the big tanks had different
senders or can this one be adjusted, or?

The UK Porsche club newsletter had an article about 6 months ago on this very
subject. It sounded so straightforward that I tried it. 
Basically, if your sender is just a bit erratic, all it needs is cleaning. By
jacking up my 79SC on the oil tank side, it is possible to remove the sender
*with the oil still in the car*. Removing the sender is a bit fiddly but
possible. Now just clean the sender and refit. Don't forget to buy a new
gasket (I did !). The sender is now back and working.

dealer), and it has broken down again. The usual cause is
the the sun roof sometimes gets stuck to the rest of the
roof and if you try opening it, it will break the teeth on
the gears inside the lifting mechanism (black box) tucked
inside the back of the roof.

I replaced the two white plastic gears inside the black box
that push the two black metal lifters that lift the back of
the sunroof up. However, the actual sunroof motor mechanism
is tucked away in the rear (driver's side) behind the
carpeting.  I've tried adjusting it according to the 944
workshop manual, but the manual is not always clear on how
to do this adjustment.

Has anyone done this adjustment ? Is it difficult to do ?

"neglible" difference between the OEM filter and the K&N.  He didn't

its also possible that white smoke can be oil getting into the exhaust 
stream somewhere where the temperature is very hot. i've seen turbo 
cars with blown
turbo seals smoke white. so if you have a turbo, and you're getting

well, i'm not a chemist, but i would guess that when it gets burnt, it

contaminated by gasoline, whereas if its just getting into the exhaust, it is
really just pure oil. i know that airplanes used for airshows often 
have 'smoke systems' on them: its really just a tank and pump, with a 
nozzle in the exhaust headers, just  past where the headers join 
together. they get a very dense, usually white smoke frome these. 
anybody out there know for sure where the color change

When I had problems with my VOLVO DME (LH-Jetronic-flavor !Motronic),
there was definately a core charge, but for what they wanted to
replace it (~1200.00 Yes there's no mistake with Zeros ) you would
sure swear that it was new.

I know we've gone through this before Kevin, but when your faced with
this decision I believe your faith in BOSCH will be forced to
it limits (Certainly in it's practices in the retail OEM market).

That being said I would have to agree with your mechanic friend in that
when a DME goes it is sudden and in addition commonly a power transitor.

Sounds like a good bet according to the BOSCH FI & EM Book.

Page 34 IDLE SPEED CONTROL
        Most Motronics control idle rpm by a combination of the
idle-speed stablilizer and ignition timing.  The stablilizer is
described in the section on LH-Jetronic.  Inputs include rpm,
closed-throttle signal, and engine temperature.  The control unit
sends on-off, or digital signals to the idle-speed stabilizer.  Early
Motronics use the auxiliary air valve to increase air flow during
warm-up, also described in the L-Jetronic section.  In these,
cold-engine idle rpm is increased according to temperature; it is an
open-loop system.

      and 72 911T.

Oops! you're right...
Please ignore my references to the lack of a "head gasket" on 911
engines. I was confused between cylinder base gasket and the true
"head gasket" and as a result I confused the issue. Sorry.

I think the "correct" info should be (concerning head gaskets/
that is *cylinder head* to *cylinder* mating):

'65-69:	head gasket made of paper/fabric with 4 holes for studs
'70-'83 "CE" type head gasket (spring ring)
'84-'89 no head gasket

please correct me if I'm wrong (again), thanks


PS: Maybe that's why the 2.7 I built has only 40psi compression :)

Subject: Take my tub!! Please...

Good Morning:

Are there any of you porschephiles out there who are seriously
into racing? Yes that's about the stupidest question I can think
of at 5 o'clock in the morning. But really, I have a '72 914 that
I've been using as a parts donor to get another one on the road.
I'm fast approaching a completely stripped carcus and since I've
gotten all the use I can out of this car I thought it might be time
to offer it up to someone who can get more use out of it than me.

The shell is in very good shape as a potential candidate for a
race car. The only rust to speak of is some in the pan around the
seat mounts and in the trunk in the back. The section under the
battery needs some attention also. It's not pretty but I've seen much
worse and the cancer isn't bad enough to where the body has started
to sag. The area of the body where the crossbar from the motor bolts
up is in good shape. Strangely there's no rust here and it's only
inches away from the cancer spot under the battery tray.

The car is up on jack stands and at present is not a roller. So if
anyone is interested you'll need some spare rolling stock or a truck
big enough so that it doesn't matter. The car is in New Orleans right
now so if you come and get it you'll have a perfect excuse to take a
vacation from work to take in a bit of the Jazz and Heritage Festival.
For those who haven't heard this is a great big party featuring the
music, crafts, and food from our area. (the stuff dreams are made of)

To close up, I hope that someone is interested enough to take my tub,
please. It sure would be gratifying to know my 914 reached a place where
it can live a better, faster life than I could provide instead of the
scrap man's scales.

Thanks for any expedient replies,
Brendin Harb

Start by deciding *WHAT YOU MEAN BY "TRACK"*. Do you mean, track
as in PCA or similar "driving schools"? Do you mean track as in PCA
*or* SCCA time trials ("Solo I")?? Do you mean track as in road race????

First thing you need to do is get a copy of the *RULES* for the types
of events you plan on using the car for. Example: simplest kind of road
racing is either PCA Club Racing or SCCA Improved Touring. In either case,
you'll *NEED* to use the original (well, mostly original 8{) ) fuel injection.
If you want to do time trials, then using carbs may move you to a class where
you're just a rolling speed bump anyway due to the level of preparedness found
on your competitors. If you just want to drive laps on a track, hey, that
varies by PCA region...

*EVERYONE OUT THERE*: listen up on this. If you think you'd like to do 
something with your car, KNOW THE RULES FIRST. You *can* take your 914
racing in SCCA ITA (2.0) or ITB (1.7 or 1.8) by only spending a few hundred
dollars on a fire extinguisher, a bolt-in roll cage, a belt set, and some
racer's tape. No other mods *necessary*. Many other are highly *desirable*.
And some of the most "desirable", particularly to people who don't do this
sort of stuff with much frequency (e.g. carbs) *WILL MAKE YOU ILLEGAL*.

Sorry to stand on my soapbox and pound on your heads, but this is something
that I see over and over and over again...

Pam,

Unfortunately I don't have a replacement radio for you,
and sounds like fixing yours may not be cost effective.

When my Blaupunkt blew a left channel on me,
the stereo places wanted $75 just to look at it and
$200-$300 to fix it ! I was not about to pay that amount 
for a radio that was only a 2-3 years old, so after searching 
for a while, I found a place in Virginia that sells parts and 
schematics for Blaupunkt radios (also SONY, Mitsubishi and 
A/C Delco/Bose). 
I bought the schematics for $10 and after getting inside my radio, 
I found the left channel amplifier chip (Toshiba TA7820P) was blown. 
So I ordered the chip ($3.00+S/H), replaced it and the radio works 
fine now.

Here's their name & tel just in case,

Blaupunkt repair center is in Illinois, (708) 865-5200

 150 MPH Speedo
Fellow PorschePhiles--
    I know that we had a thread on Speedos/Odometers through here a while back,
but I have no idea which archive to FTP for the correct "back issues", so here
we go again.
    The odometer in my 150 MPH speedo from the '74 914 has stopped working.  I
recall that one common cause of that had to do with the small "trip" odometer. 
Yesterday morning I bought a 150 MPH speedo (with non-working odometer) at the
AutoMotion swap meet.  After I opened it up (thanks for the bezel advice
earlier), I found that _this_ one wasn't working because one gear was spinning
on its spindle.
    I'm not completely sure how to describe it, but:
    When the cable into the back gets turned, a set of gears & worm gears turns
one metal gear that goes through the center of the main odometer numbers.  It
looks as if that should turn one metal gear on the other side of the housing,
but inside the housing.  Right now, that gear just slips on the spindle. 
Should that be what turns it?  How is it supposed to be fixed on there?  Would
some CA (cyano-acrylate; Crazy Glue) fix this problem?  If not, what should I
do?  How is that spindle held in there--there is no nut or clip on the other
end?
    Also, is the "main" odometer supposed to advance when you re-set the "trip"
odometer?  If not, I must be wrong about how the whole thing is supposed to
work.

    Thanks for the advice!

Hi all-

I noticed with some interest that both Automotion and Performance Products
have recently started to advertise turbo rebuild kits for 930's, 931's, and
951's.  The kits generally include a new bearing, new seals, plus assorted
washers and seals for about $150-$190.  Given the cost and relatively short
lifespan of even a professionally rebuilt turbo, such a kit would appear to be
a very cost-effective way to handle this all too common problem.

Anybody have any experience w/these or with turbo rebuilding in general?  Any
reason why a shadetree mechanic would _not_ want to give this try?

I would try "wicking Locktite", one of Locktite's anaerobic locking agents
which has a very thin viscosity to allow it to wick into narrow gaps and
then harden. The Locktite number which comes to mind is 290, but you
should double check that based on the above description.

I had my turbo ('86 951) rebuilt by Turbo City, near L.A.  They did a 
fine job and I have no problems with it.

You cannot rebuild it without special tools, since many parts are 
press-fit, and the internal bearings are not reachable without special 
tools.  Also, once you reassemble it, you cannot dynamically balance it 
at high speed.

Check Autoweek / Pano for their number.

 Paul:

I have rebuilt a turbocharger once before but it wasn't for a Porsche.
It was for a Merkur XR4Ti. Anyway there really isn't any reason why a
well equipped shade tree mechanic couldn't do this. But, there are some
precautions that need to be taken and some problems to overcome.

One of the problems I encountered was getting the turbo dismantled. Of
course some are easier than others, but you need to be prepared to use
some heat for stubborn housing bolts. I used a portable blow torch, the
kind that can be bought at hardware stores. I've never looked at a turbo
from a Porsche that close before but some turbo manufacturers use a band
clamp w/ a nut and bolt and some don't. Cross your fingers and hope that
Porsche used this type 'cause it's a lot easier to get apart.

One of the precautions that need to be taken is the preparation of the
workspace. The best advice I can give on this venue is that *CLEANLINESS
IS NEXT TO GODLINESS*!! This is extremely important as the bearing sur-
faces and seals are susciptible to premature breakdown if everything is
not really, really, very, very clean!!

Also, be careful and note exactly how everything comes apart. Some seals
can actually be put in backwards and can result in catastrophe. And on
the turbo I rebuilt some of the materials that the bearing surfaces were
made of were sensitive to the oils that are present in our fingers. Make
sure before you undertake this that you have a good manual for your type
of turbo.

Good Luck!

Subject: Smoke colors again (indirectly...)

I have a 1980 non-turbo 924.  It's been going through oil slowly, but recently
the rate has increased, accompanied by that rather worrying blue smoke under
acceleration.  A closer look at the smoke shows that in addition to the blue,
there is a puff of black when the throttle is released.  I immediately
suspected the blue smoke to be the piston rings, and the black to be a faulty
deceleration valve.  The deceleration valve, however, does seem to be working
OK (revs decay quickly to about 2000, then more slowly to idle, and if I
disconnect the inlet hose to the deceleration valve and block it with my
finger, I can feel it suck when I release the throttle by hand).

If anybody can give me advice on the following questions, I'd appreciate it:

 - WRT blue smoke;
	What can I do to hold off an engine rebuild for as long as possible?
	How should I decide what is 'too bad' to continue?
	
 - WRT black smoke on closing throttle;
	What else could be causing this? (The car doesn't start all that well
	well when cold; takes a few goes, then runs a little rough for a few
	minutes, so maybe some of the cold-start gear isn't fully up to spec.
	It also has an exhaust leak that's on my 'to do' list, so the back-
	pressure may be down a bit, if that might have any effect...)

Subject: advice sought on 89 944 S2

 
I would like to ask the net's wisdom on what to look for in
an 89 944S2. It is apparently in very nice shape (I'll probably
go to see it tonight), with 26K miles, dark blue with white leather
interior.

One concern is with the interior -- does anyone have this color
and how much work is it to keep it nice? It's certainly not the
shade I would have chosen. Also, the seller (not the one owner,
who apparently leased it, and without the service records) says
that it has chrome wheels and that they are not in mint condition.
If it has the optional turbo wheels in anodized aluminum and the
anodization was removed to polish them, is it possible to refinish
them at not too great an expense?

What mechanical things should I look out for? My impression is that
by the time of the S2, most of the bugs (engine mounts, timing
belt, front A-arms) were already ironed out.

He's asking $17,500, and willing to go a little lower.

Any comments (by e-mail, please, I'm on the digest version) would
be much appreciated. Thanks!

Two points, Mike:

1) Chromed wheels aren't very good at the track - they get very, very 
hot and reduce cooling relative to unplated wheels (but they're fine 
elsewhere, i.e., autox).

2) Kevin Gross has light-colored leather seats and can tell you about 
the wear he's had in 6 years of 4-season ownership...  Kevin?

The price sounds good.  I don't know of anything peculiar to the S2 
mechanically - just check the cam belt & pullies.

Subject: Re: advice sought on 89 944 S2

Uh, well, I wasn't going to say anything, but since Jim Selders
volunteered my name...  I would hate to have to keep a white interior
clean.  My car gets driven daily, I wear a lot of black, and my grey-
beige leather driver's seat is a little darker for it all.  But really,
unless you are a concours nut, a light coloured interior isn't really
too hard to live with.  There are all sorts of cleaners which will
keep it looking spiffy.

The chromed wheels could be a problem.  Generally you end up with a
galvanic effect between the chrome and underlying alloy, which causes
the chrome plating to deteriorate.  I think that Robert Wood gets around
the problem by using intermediate copper and nickel platings.  Whether
that solves the problems completely, or even at all, I don't know.

At 17,500, the price is pretty much right for an '89, I think.  This
depends on the car checking out otherwise mechanically and body-wise.

My experience suggests that just because the water is puddling in the rear
footwells doesn't necessarily mean that it is getting in at the back of the car.

Other than the window seals, areas to check are the plastic film behind the door
trim and that there are no holes *through* the channel that supports the door
seal (it has taken me a *heck* of a long time to discover this is where the
water is getting into my '72 E - I had some repair work done in this area
and they were not diligent enough with the seam sealer).  Oh - and you should
check the condition of your door seals of course if you didn't replace these
along with the window rubbers.

I'm sure there are other areas to check ... good luck

I do need a number of parts, mostly interior and cosmetic.  Off the top
of my head, I could use:
	Front bumper, '70-'72
	Front bumper upper trim (the big black rubber piece), '70-'74
	Special Edition front air dam, '74
	Outer door skins, '70-'72
	Speaker grilles
	Dashboard, preferably early, not cracked
	Windshield that's not too pitted
and probably much, much more.  I'm not far away, so perhaps I could come by
sometime and pick over your inventory...?

I also have a set of dual Weber 40IDA's, including manifolds, horns, filters,
and linkage that I'd love to trade or sell.  The carbs are in excellent
condition.  I don't know if the manifolds and linkage came from a Type-I or
Type-IV, so they may or may not fit, but everything else is definitely the
right stuff.

Let me know if you're interested!

Subject: Water Leaks (was: 1971 911T)

Steve,

Water leaking into the floor of the rear seating area is
a common problem in VW's.  It is most often caused by the
vapor barrier in the door not being sealed.  There is a
plastic sheet glued to the inside of the door underneath
the door trim panel.  Normally rain travels along the glass
into the door and out the drains at the bottom of the door.
When the vapor barrier becomes detached at the bottom of the
door the water then also runs into the inside of the car
and into the rear seat foot well.

It tried fixing this in my VW GTI by using duct tape to
seal the bottom of the vapor barrier.  I have since noticed
that duct tape does not create a waterproof seal but very
little water is getting inside of the car.

Also, do you have to use the old rubber center disc on the 83 or can you

My question is this- what should I expect at this price? Should I expect to

likewise expect to have both virtually replaced? Along those lines,
does anyone have the names & addresses of any mail-order parts

In my old Porsche, a 62, the plastic is slit and the bottom edge tucked 
inside the interior of the door.  That way any water which gets onto the
plastic sheet is drained into the interior of the door where it can escape
through the drain holes at the bottom of the door.  I believe if you
use duct tape to seal the bottom of the sheet to the inner surface of the
door (that surface which is directly covered with the interior door 
panel) the duct tape will eventually fail and leak water into the car.

Another possible cause of water getting into the interior is plugging of
the drain holes in the bottom of the door.  My daughter's Buick Skyhawk
had water puddling on the floor, and when I cleared the drain holes 
in the door, over a gallon of rainwater leaked out.

I was looking into 914's for a while, and the pricing (at least in New England)
was like this:
$0-$500 Parts car, needs most everything fixed/replaced
$500-$1000 running, needs some restoration to be put on the road
$1000-$2000 Usually registerable, needs some work to be nice
$2000-$3000 Nice car, drive it as is
$3000-$$$$$ Mint original, heavily modified

This was this winter, prices will go up in spring/summer, but shouldn't be
that much more.

I bought a '74 (and part of a '73) with $2500 worth of new parts (I have the 
recepts) for $700.  All I have to do now is assemble the car...

I could use some 914 parts, too.
	73 or later transaxle (or at least the rear cover with mounts)
	whole body (just the shell, I've got a car that's majorly rotted)
	custom body parts (flares, ground effects, spoilers, etc)
	dual carbs (40mm, ~$100, I can rebuild them)
	driving lights (the round ones from the factory)

I've got some parts I don't need, too.  (trade/buy anyone?)
	early transaxle
	1.7 motor (needs rebuild)
	3 fuel injection systems
	dash part of A/C system (compresser and condenser already gone)
	heater system (enough parts for more than one)
	5 factory alloy rims (not sure which type)

	A friend recently purchaced a '75 914 1.8 for just under $4000
(original asking price was $4000).  The body is perfect, the interior is
nearly perfect (one small tear in one of the seats), and the engine and
transmission were sick (_were_, they were rebuilt after he bought it).  You
should be able to get a really good 1.7 or 1.8 for $4000, a 2.0 would be
more expensice (or in need of much more work at that price) and a 914-6
would be a rust covered pile of dust with the engine missing. 
	By the way, this little market survey comes from the Seattle area,

Here's what I know: almost all 914s need four things: rust repair, interior
repair, engine rebuild, and new synchros. Some need more things. Some need
less. Even the "perfect" cars often have at least one of these problems
lurking around....

7 to 10 years ago, you could actually find rust-free cars. Amazing as it
sounds, it's true! So it made some difference in how much time you spent
looking for "nice, straight, rust-free, original cars", since you could
find them. Now days, it's just about impossible, and when you *DO* find
them, they're collector pieces set up for the concours or speculator
crowd. Naturally, this means they're very economically priced 8{P

Here's my approach, and I apply it to early 911s too. I look for a car
that is cheap, and plan on doing *all* the work to it. Period. That means,
for 914s, the rust and paint, probably the engine if not right now then
soon, and eventually the transmission. It took some doing but I found a 
guy who can do usually do all the rust on a 914 correctly *and* repaint it in
a suitably high-quality way for $1500 to $2000, depending on whether or not
it has the engine, etc., in when I drop it off. So I usually get a car,
being careful to pay under $2k for it, pull the engine and transmission, 
and drop it off. Now, if it was running OK before, then I have a $3500
investment in a car that has all the rust repaired correctly, a fresh
coat of Glasurit in the right factory color, and the interior freshened
a bit as I put it all back together. 

If it wasn't running OK before, then I can take the engine apart and
rebuild it. If it was kind of OK, but not great, I can work on whatever
needed work. At the very least, I can clean it all up and make sure things
are working right on the outside (like the EFI, the heaters, etc.)

If the engine needs to be rebuilt, I have a deal with a guy to do the
rebuild for $600 plus parts if I bring him the engine, so if I don't need 
to replace major parts (which is surprisingly often the case) and if I don't 
want to build a race engine or something, the net cost is about $1k. Which 
brings my total investment up to $4500.

If the transmission just can't be used, then it's not cost effective to
do anything but swap for a rebuilt unit at about $1500. 

So, worst case is that starting with a $2000 car, you have a *nearly perfect*
car (at least as far as "daily driver" or maybe "part-time autox" is concerned)
for $6000 total. That's not too bad. Or you can buy a $3000+ car
and probably spend at least as much getting it right. Or, if you're lucky, do
what a friend did and buy one off of a mechanic's lien for $700 and spend $2k
making a just about perfect car.

So, my advice is to start cheap, and build to what you want. Of course, it's
just about impossible to get your bank / credit union /etc to finance something
like this, but hey, it's hard to finanace an older car anyway.

Obligatory plug: Ghost Racing/Part Time Parts *does* do this for customers.
Since we have 8 original 914/6s, and since that's in the whole percentage
points of existing cars, we probably know as much if not more about getting
them right than anyone in the country.  We don't do much of this, and we 
don't make much money off of doing it, but doing enough of it keeps our 
parts and services volumes up high enough to keep our racing costs down. 
We can even acquire "donor cars" for starting off one of these projects
if you don't have a car to start with. And if you want to wind up with a 
"special purpose" car, like for autox or road racing or time trials, since 
we do all that SUCCESSFULLY ourselves, it's easy for us to make something which
makes you successful too.  Just don't expect us to give you something better 
than we have if you're in the Houston area....

Where are you located?  (How far away di I have to go to get it?) Also, almost
all the parts I have are for a '74, and I want to go with the later trans, is
that compatiable with the '70 body?  

As for the fuel injection systems, two came in a box of parts I got with my 
car.  One has to be from the good engine, which is a 2.0.  Another is on 
an unidentified stock engine, which I think is likely to be a 1.7.  I thought
that I had only these two, but then I found another "brain".  I have never 
seen a complete car, so I don't know what exactly I have, but I know that I 
don't need it so its got to go.

As stated earlier, the year and engine size heavily influence the going rate. 
If you know something about 914's in general, please ignore my ramblings.  But:
Year  Engine            Transmission     etc.
70       1.7L 4-cyl    Rear-Shift        Spartan interior.  Non-adjustable
                                                       pass. seat.  $2000 in
good shape
70       2.0L 6-cyl    Rear-shift(?)   6-cylender version has early 911T
                                                      engine.  $10K in OK
shape.  Collector.
71       1.7L 4-cyl    Rear                 Almost identical to '70 (better
int?)
71       2.0L 6-cyl    Rear                 Ditto.
72       1.7L 4-cyl    Rear                 Interior definitely better.  Adj.
pass.
                                                       seat, better handbrake,
etc.  $2.5K
73       1.7L 4-cyl    Side-shift         Improved int.  Reliable window
cranks.
                                                       Shift linkage shorter,
more reliable.  $3K
73        2.0L 4-cyl   Side                  _The_ 4-cyl 914.  Both big option
pak's
                                                       standard.  More powerful
eng.  $5K+
74        1.8L 4-cyl   Side                  Lower power than 1.7, less
reliable FI. $3K+
74        2.0L 4-cyl   Side                  Same as 73, but options not
standard.  $5K+-
75        1.8L 4-cyl   Side                  Catalytic converter, 5MPH bumpers.
 $3-4K
75        2.0L 4-cyl   Side                  Cat. conv, bumpers.  Loses power. 
$4-5K+
76        2.0L 4-cyl   Side                  Made with 75's, pretty much
identical.  $5K

Prices are my guesses at SF Bay Area prices for a car in pretty good shape, ie,
no huge rot, engine not in immediate need of attention, tranny a little
crunchy, etc.
    The two major option packages are the Sport and Appearance groups.  Sport=
forged Fuchs alloys + sway bars F/R.  App= Center console w/extra gauges +
chrome bumpers + ????
    The side-link tranny is much less finicky than the earlier one, due to a
shorter linkage (but still pretty long).  The 1.8L has a different type of FI,
which is prone to damage from backfires.  It is the least powerful 914, except
for CA emissions '73 1.7L's.
    The 2.0L loses power with the cat. conv, but the 1.8 doesn't (good thing,
it can't afford to!).  The 5MPH bumpers are quite a bit heavier than the early
bumpers, and distribute the weight out to the ends.
    In general, things get better the later you go.  In '75, however,
performance drops a bit.
    Things To Watch Out For:  Check the suspension console in the engine
compartment ender the battery.  _Frequent_ rust.  If it's too bad, the
suspension dies on RR corner.  Check rubber for obvious leaks.  Take the roof
off (even in cold Chi..) and sit in it.  Roll the windows down, then up.  If
the window sticks when you open the door, some structural rot underneath (inner
rockers, "box-beams").  Beware of "Fred Flinstone"-mobiles.  Oil leaks are not
uncommon, but can be embarrassing--often, it drips onto the exhaust, then burns
off.  Lots of smoke.  Leaks can be _rather_ expensive to fix.  Transmission
grinding noises are expensive.  First gear grinding a bit is not great, but
fairly common.  Second gear as well is _bad_.  Reverse is un-synched, so it
grinds if you're moving forward at all.  Someone once tried to tell me that the
thing was designed so that you had to put it in 2nd for 1st not to grind. 
Bull.
    Engines tend to last 120K mi or so.  I know of one or two 200K's, but those
are very rare.  I've heard of others lasting far less, usually due to lack of
maintenance.  Rebuilds are anywhere from $3K-5K +, depending on engine size,
what needs to be done, etc.  Any work you can do yourself reduces price
accordingly, i.e., removing the engine, tranny & sheet metal saves an awful
lot!
    Transmission rebuilds range from about $800 on up, up , up!  Most common
quote around here was about $1K with it out of car.  Makes a lot of assumptions
about what's wrong inside, though, so it can get _much_ more expensive.
    Anyway, it's a great little car to have fun in, and you can even carry a
fair amount of (flat-shaped) stuff with you.  And it's a _dream_ around
corners.  Good luck, and I hope you join us!

 150 MPH Speedo
Hello, again!
    Just in case anyone is interested, I'm posting the results of my
investigation of my 150 MPH speedo.
    The symptom is that the odometer stops clocking miles.  The problem is a
gear in the odometer mechanism that slips on its shaft, instead of turning with
it.  The metal gear on the right side of the housing, inside the housing, is
just press-fit onto its shaft.  It should turn with the shaft, and after a
while just starts slipping.
    An early symptom is that re-setting the trip odometer advances the main
odometer.
    If anyone is interested, e-mail me, and I'll send you (or post) how I fixed
it.

The 911, 912 (911 body w/ 356 engine), 912E (911 body with 914 2.0 engine),
and to a lesser extent, 930 (911 Turbo) all look like 911s. Oh sure, there
are a *ZILLION* special race models that look more or less like 911s, but 
you'll never see those...

> What is the difference between and 911 E S T?

Best source of info is Bruce Anderson's book "The 911 Performance Handbook".
Sells for about $20, usually available in larger book stores and always 
available through the big mail-order Porsche parts houses. In a nutshell
the T is the "tourist" model, which is pretty spartan and always has carbs;
the E has softest suspension but usually has a pretty  peppy engine as it's
fuel injected (that's why it's an "E"); the S is the "sport" model and is
by far the most desirable of the early cars.

>When looking for a porsche, what are some danger areas that I should look
>for?  Rust/ paint/ engine?

Again, see Anderson's book. There are a zillion things to worry about in
buying a 911. You should find a friend who owns one and a competent 
mechanic as well to check the car out, etc. before buying one. Once you
have  a "bad car" it's super expensive to make it right...

Subject: 150 MPH Speedo Proc (long..

 150 MPH Speedo Proc (long...)
    There have been a number of requests for my method of fixing my busted
odometer, so here goes.
    The speedo I fixed was the one that I bought at the AutoMotion swap meet,
so I did not get a chance to take it out of the car.  Also, due to the fact
that my 914 is currently unavailable, I have not been able to test the fix in
the car.
    This procedure is written from the perspective of someone who is not very
mechanically inclined, so forgive me any inaccurate or imprecise terms.  Also,
the directions make more sense if you can see the parts that I'm talking about.
    The first thing you need to do is to remove the speedo from the instrument
cluster.  The shop manual tells us to do this after taking the knob and
retaining nut from the trip odometer reset cable, and removing the steering
wheel.  (Is this last one necessary in fact?)
    The next thing is to remove the lightbulbs from the housing, and disconnect
the various wires and such from the unit.  The speedometer drive cable has a
(large-ish) retaining nut which needs to be unscrewed, so the cable can be
disconnected.  (I'm looking forward to trying these steps when I actually get
the speedo out of the car.)
    The odometer reset cable can simply be pulled out of the back of the
housing, although it takes some effort to break that white plastic retainer
loose.
    Next, you need to remove the glass bezel from the front of the unit.  The
glass is retained by a metal piece that is folded around a lip on the outside
of the housing.  The metal piece retaining the bezel is fairly flexible, so the
folded part can be un-folded with a small screwdriver or knife.  I used my
handy dandy Swiss Army Knife.  The retaining piece is a ring of metal with bent
edges, when it is not on the housing.  Two other such rings will come off after
it--one on the outside of the glass, one on the inside.
    You need to check the "rest position" of the speedometer needle.  To do
this, you can bend the needle up just enough to clear the "peg" at the bottom
of the scale.  Let it come to rest, and then mark or remember that position. 
The needle should then be removed from its spindle.  It takes some careful
prying--be careful not to scratch the black paint on the dial face.  There is a
conical cap over the center which is a separate piece, and appears to have been
glued on originally.
    Next, you can remove the dial face.  Just unscrew the two small black
screws on the dial face--I used the small blade on the Army knife.  This
exposes the guts of your odometer.
    Turn the housing over.  Unscrew the two screws on the back.  The mechanism
will fall out of the housing, so catch it!
    The guts have two main sections that screw together.  The "back" (which
originally faced the front of the car) has the magnet for the speedometer, and
some of the reduction gearing for the odometer.  It is held by two screws to
the "front", with two locating pins that stick into holes in the front half. 
Unscrew these screws.  Do not unscrew anything on the side of the front, or a
tiny gear will fall out, and then you have to figure out how to put it back
between the trip odometer and the main one.  A larger white plastic shaft with
a "regular" gear on one end and a worm gear on the other end will now fall off,
or can be pulled out.  Do so.
    The worm gear end of that gear should have meshed with a metal gear on the
left-hand side (as seen from the dial face side) of the front half housing. 
This gear is on a shaft which goes through the front half, and all the main
odometer wheels spin on that shaft.  On the right-hand side, just past the
"ones" digit, is a silver-colored metal gear that is inside the wall of the
front half housing.  The right-side gear should turn when the left-side one
does.
    Now for the interesting part.  Pull the left-side gear and shaft out of the
front half housing.  The numbered rollers will fall out as well as the metal
gear.  Find them, and remember what order they were in.  The roller with the
white teeth on the side (and internal ratchet) is the "ones" digit.  Note the
position of the white gears above the rollers--I'm not sure how important they
are, so I tried to keep them in position.
    Figure out the position on the shaft that the metal gear fits on.  Knurl
that place on the shaft.  I did mine by squeezing it several times with a pair
of needle-nosed pliers--the "teeth" left ridges that seemed to be just the
right size.
    Next, re-assemble the rollers on the shaft, in the front half housing. 
Slide the small white gears on the top side to the right, to allow you to place
the rollers in the housing.  Poke the shaft through the left side hole, just
far enough to see, and place the ten-thous roller on.  The small white gear
fits into the teeth on the right-hand side of the roller.  Slide the shaft
through the roller, and put the next one on.  Keep going until you have all the
rollers on.
    It is tricky to place the right-side metal gear correctly, but it can be
done.  It fits just like a very small numbered roller, with no small gear to
its right.  If you have knurled the shaft enough, it should be difficult to
push the shaft through.  I dould do mine with my hands, but it took some doing.
 Push the shaft all the way in.
    Now check the operation of the odometer.  By turning the left-side
(external) metal gear, the right-side (internal) one should turn, as should the
tenths digit on the trip odometer.  Check to see when the main odometer changes
to the next "one".  It should happen when the trip odometer goes from nine
tenths to zero tenths.  If it doesn't, and you want it to "look right", you
will have to re-position the right-side metal gear.  You might wish to start
with the trip odometer at zero.  Re-knurling is probably not necessary.  Mine
right now changes ones when the trip odometer goes from zero tenths to
one-tenth.
    Re-assemble the speedo, in reverse order from how you got it apart.  The
needle should be carefully placed as close as you can to its original rest
position.  Then place it back above the "peg", and bend it back down so that
the peg can stop it.  You may want to test the accuracy by finding an automatic
radar trailer that posts your speed as you go by.  (Yeah, right!)
    To replace the glass bezel, put the three metal rings and the glass back
into place, and bend the outermost piece of metal back around the lip on the
outer housing.  It probably will not look very professional when you're done,
but it's buried back in the instrument cluster, so what the heck.  If you
really want it to be perfect, find a friendly VDO mechanic who can bend and
un-bend the metal for you.
    A final note:  This long-winded procedure is intended solely for those of
us whose odometers have stopped functioning, and wish to fix them.  Rolling
back your speedometer just to fool someone is very dishonest and lacking in
class, which is something that I would like to think Porsche owners have.  It
could also possibly damage the reputation of our favorite marque, and possibly
that of Porsche owners in general.

    Thanks for putting up with my wordiness!

I've done about three of these operations on speedometers over the last six or

  1) You don't have to take the steering wheel off.  You have to jockey the
     speedometer around to get it out.
  2) You don't have to remove the needle or the gauge face.  You pretty much
     pull the whole mess out of the housing, remove the odometer digit shaft,
     knurl the point on the shaft that the lead-like gear rides on, and put the
     shaft assembly back together with all the digits aligned correctly.  This

Subject: Paint jobs

I am thinking of having my '76 911S painted.  As I have never had a
car painted before I am looking for some general advice.  First the
basics: the car body is in very good shape.  I don't have any rust or
any damage, but the previous paint is blemeshed in places and looks
like someone rubbed it down with 50 grit sandpaper on the roof and
rear decklid (I have seen this effect on other cars, does anyone know
what causes it?)  Also, I'm not planning to keep this car too much
longer (or show it), so I don't need the ultimate in logevity.

Prices seem to range from a few hundred to thousands of dollars.  Any
advice on what a good "decent" job should cost?  I once read somewhere
that much of what you pay for as you go up the scale is the degree of
car preparation prior to the actual painting.  Is this true?

Is there some kind of book anyone recommends for getting up to speed
on this topic?

Finally, do any SF Bay area readers of this list have any local paint
shop recommendations?  I live/work in Mountain View/Palo Alto.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Report: Working on 914



	Howdy all,

	This weekend was the first "Fix up der 914" weekend :-).  I
am currently restoring a '74 1.8L 914.  The problem I was addressing
this weekend was the car's total lack of an idle.  I have checked all
the hoses and there wasn't anything terribly wrong there, and the car
runs pretty well once you get it started, so I figured there was
something wrong with the FI system.  I gathered all the manuals I have 
(and bought a Bosch manual) and started going through all the diagnostics
I could.  The following is the list of things I checked and what I
found out.

	The first test was the Air Flow Meter or Intake Air Sensor 
(different manuals call it something different).  According to the 
manuals there should be a infinite resistance
between terminals 36 and 39 when the flap is closed and zero
resistance when it is open.  I got zero resistance at both :-(.  I
also checked for a 200-400 ohm resistance between terminals 6 and 9,
and a resistance of 120-400 ohms between 7 and 8.  The Meter failed
all of these tests.  I determined that I needed a new one.  Anyone
have one for sale (that works)?

	I then went on to check the Cold Start valve.  At 70 degrees F
it is supposed to produce zero volts, which it did.  I am not sure
what this test is supposed to mean though.  As per instructions I
tested the valve with the harnes disconnected.  So, how is the
valve supposedto prodcue any voltage with no incoming power?  

	The Throttle Valve Switch was next.  When the throttle was
closed it has infinite resistance between terminals 3 and 18, as it
should.  When the throttle plate was open it had zero resistance,
again, as it should.

	The Aux. Air Regulator had a resistance of 30.3 ohms, and was
supposed to have about 30 ohms.  Wow, another working part :-).

	The Head Temperature Sensor, which was VERY DIFFICULT to find
from the descriptions in the manuals had a resistance of 2.35 K Ohms
and should have been in the range of 1500-2500 ohms.  Again, another
okay part.

	I tried to check the Thermo switch, but I couldn't get the
wire harness plug off.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to do
that?  It is a really tight fit down under the COld Start Valve.

	At this point I had run out of sensors to check (since I dont
have a fuel pressure gauge) and looked at the relay panel on the left
side of the engine compartment.  Amazingly enough I was missing two
relays: the Main Power and Fuel Pump relays.  From my understanding of
how the FI works, the car should NOT have started/run without these
relays.  When I put in two other ones there was NO difference in how
the car ran.  Could someone explain to me what these relays really do?
Or does the car really run on black magic?

	I only found one thing wrong with the fuel injection: the broken
Air Flow Meter.  Could that prevent the car from idling?  Are there
other things that could also influence the cars idle?  I haven't checked
the valves yet, but I will.  I will also replace all the hoses just
in case there is a leak somewhere.  Suggestions?

	All in all I learned a whole heapin lot about how the fuel
injection on the 914 1.8L works.  I also discovered some things that
didn't make sense.  Hopefully the list can answer some of the
questions I had above.

	I thought that some people on the list would be
interested in what I went through to test/debug my FI since I know
that there are a couple of people restoring 914's.  I hope that some
of this helps.  If anyone finds it innappropriate, please let me know.

	If anyone has any comments/suggestions please drop me a line.
I am also going to send out a Part Wish List to those who are parting
out 914's... I hope ya'll respond.  There are some things that I
really need.

	Alex

If its the standard square Bosche plastic plug connector, the kind

Uh, if the thing is missing these relays then either someone did a

are in another socket.

Find and eliminate any air intake leaks. Re-check the AF sensor,
because if its truly dead then the car shouldn't run under load.
Find air leaks by squirting some propane or carb-cleaner into the
engine bay while the engine is running (keep an extinguisher handy)
and listen for idle transitions as the mixture is drawn into the
leaking area.

This is the one part on a 1.8 that you *really* are better off buying
new. The problem is that over time, the "swinging door" air flow plate
warps, and if the car has backfired through the air box, it may be
really messed up. So, when you get a used AFM, you just aren't sure what
it is that you have. It's also the most expensive part on your system 8{(
but it's very similar to the parts used on VW Beetles with EFI. So it's
at least readily available...

Ah! You tested the wrong part. Test the *connector* that you removed
from the valve, not the valve itself. The "valve" is really another
injector... You need to do this after you've run the engine for a while
to make sure that it's "warm". You should (for completeness) also check
it when the engine is cold, cold, cold. Like after having been off
overnight.

>	The Aux. Air Regulator had a resistance of 30.3 ohms, and was
>supposed to have about 30 ohms.  Wow, another working part :-).

Yup, and actually the one most likely to (a) fail and (b) cause you not
to idle right. You also need to do the rest of the check on this sucker,
to make sure that the sliding plate inside it is really open when cold
and closed when warm. Otherwise, you're adding more unmetered air at warm
or not getting enough at cold, which will cause you to mis-adjust your 
idle to compensate, which has bad effect higher up in the RPM range.

If this guy fails, you typically notice because you'll be running OK,
the car will get a little hot, and then *BOOM!* no more injection. I've
spent far too much time pouring cold soft drinks on the head temp sensor
to get it cool enough to let me start the car and get it home so I can
change the sensor... Then again, this is in Houston, not the Frozen North....

If the Cold Start Valve is working right (umm, let's see: engine cold, 
turn on switch, cold start valve fires for about 20 seconds, then 
stops) then the Thermo Time Switch is OK. That's what it does -- turn
off the Cold Start Valve after a bit.... One way to check this is by
pulling the Cold Start Valve from it's mounted possition, sticking it in
a small container so that you don't spray gas everywhere, then cycling the
ignition switch.

Hmmmm. Well, that typically means that you have a bad breadboard and that
at some point in the past, someone decided that it was easier to install 
another relay somewhere else than to fix what was wrong... Good luck finding
all that.

I spent about 6 hours chasing two missing wires on my ITA race car, because
someone did something similar. Turns out that two of the wires on the wiring
harness from the front of the car to the breadboard weren't connected at either
end and that there were two other wires run through the center tunnel mixed
in with the other misc. add-on instruments. Man, what a nightmare... Still not
as bad as like re-wiring a 356 from scratch, but hey...

And, you really do need to beg/borrow/steal a fuel pressure gauge and 
set the pressure. And for the 1.8,  you also need a hand-held vacuum
pump so you can check pressure "under load" as well, since you're
supposed to get a pressure boost to flow more gas in that situation.

You should *ALWAYS* start working on an injected Porsche (OK, OK--- an
injected AIR COOLED Porsche 8{) ) by adjusting the valves. And on the
1.8 914, it's very critical to have a good seal on the valve cover
gaskets, the oil filler cap, and the oil filler gizmo base gasket. It
makes a *BIG* difference -- most times, the cars just won't idle with the
oil filler cap off... 

Another big thing on the 1.8 is the misc. "gaskets" -- the big rubber
boots going from the air box to the manifolds, the intake manifold gasket,
the injector seals, the gasket under the cold start valve. In short, 
any piece of rubber-like substance that gets between the inside of the 
intake system and the outside air. If any of these guys are leaking, you'll
have an unmetered air problem. If any of them are cracked, you may have
an intermittent problem as they'll be leaky cold then warm up and swell
and stop leaking.  Loads of fun to find and fix, so I just replace everything
about once every 3-4 years. And if I'm starting on a car I don't know, I 
just do it up front.

As to hoses, go to your friendly neighborhood BOSCH PARTS SPECIALIST
and get the right *GERMAN* hoses. The fuel hose *must* be the braided
75psi stuff that was on the car when it left Germany; American hose
will burst under pressure. The "air" hoses are less critical, but I
usually make sure that they're the "right" kind too. Makes the engine
compartment look better, and greatly reduces the chance of an air leak.
Also, use German hose clamps (Wurth or Winzer) that don't cut into the
hoses as opposed to American hose clamps which are *designed* to cut
into the hoses.

Subject: Fitting CD in a 944


	In an impulse buy last weekend, I acquired a 10-disk CD autochanger
for the car (85/2 944). I had planned to install the autochanger bit in
the RHS rear "locker" (the battery is in the LHS one), but am having
difficulties mounting it there. The hardware which came with the unit
(Aiwa) is really designed for mounting onto a flat carpeted area (there are
2 metal brackets which you stick under the carpet and the autochanger
screws onto them), but I can't seem to use it in the "locker" (do these
spaces have an official name?)

	My options seem to be:

1. Mount the autochanger in the "boot" ("trunk"?) instead. Disadvantages
are that (a) it would be visible to potential thieves and (b) it would
reduce the (already small) space available.

2. Wrap the autochanger in a foam sleeve which is shaped to the locker
(there are no ventillation slots on it) rather than screwing it in place.

3. Pay my local stereo shop to install it for me :-(

4. Obtain some brilliant solution from a porschephile who has already done
something similar.

	I had also planned to run the cable along the RHS of the car and
then under the dash, but I see from the workshop manual that the Porsche
cellphone which is normally fitted in the RHS locker has its cable run
along the centre tunnel. Any opinions on which is the easier cable run?

P.S. On a recent trip to Italy, I chanced upon the Milan Automobile Club.
Their bookshop is huge, with over 100 different books (I counted them!)  on
Porsches, in a variety of languages.

There was also a marked lack of Italian exotica on the streets of the
fashion capital of the world. I saw one Ferrari and one Lambourghini in a
showroom and one Maserati on the street. There were lots of 911s about
(many with German or Swiss plates), two 924s, one 944 :-( and one 928.

Subject: Re: Fitting CD in a 944

I have a very nice install (or so I've been told) involves a board
(pine) and a wedge between the board and the rear corner framing below
the tail light.  The left rear compartment is used and the board fits up
against the inner panel.  The CD changer screws to that board.  The
assembly is nice inthet, if properly constructed, it slides quicky in to
place and is vert tight with the wedge board in place.

If you send me some mail I can get you a traced outline.  

I made it so the entire setup (remopvable head unit, 3 amps, CD changer)
speaker box) had quick disconnects and te system could be out or in in
about 5 minutes.  Also nice is that it allows you to use a single stereo
for multiple vehicles.

An amp mount plate was fabricated, as mirror image of above for the
right compartment and a third amp was mounted on a panel which dropped
in in front of the spare tire.  This had wedge shaped appendages which
pressed against the spare tire rim.

As above, I still have all these peices (though not a 951) so if you
need templates send me some mail.

True!  I run these on the Vette and they are excellent tires for the
money.  They do actually stand out more in the wet than the dry, but still
perform nicely in the dry when compared to Goodyear GS-C, Michelin XGT,
Dunlop SP8000, etc.  They sport a softer sidewall and more open tread than
most of these other tires giving them a more gradual turn-in response and
good transitional characteritics.  Ride is cushy and noise is minimal.
Wet traction is simply amazing!  I don't autocross on these tires but I
suppose it wouldn't be a problem.  Only thing I might worry is the amount
of flex one would get in the full-tread/small area tread-blocks under
extreme cornering - this could cause the tread blocks to chunk or heat/wear
excessively.  Dunno though - haven't tried racing on these.  Since you
aren't planning on racing them - don't worry about it.  Anyhow, unless you
can get a great sale price on any other tire, I would recommend the BFG
Comp T/A 3 as well.  Check Tire Rack for prices - (800) 428-8355

 Speedo Update
Howdy, all, again!
    Latest report on the 914 Speedo saga--
    I got my car back (runs well, now!), and replaced my speedometer with the
one I had fixed.  That was when I noticed some differences between them (more
on that later).  On the test drive, the speedo and odometer worked (yay!), but
the needle was insufficently damped, and showed wild oscillations above about
60 MPH.  Yesterday I drove to work, and the speedometer/cable was making an
awful rubbing sound.  It became noticeable above 30, and was VERY LOUD above
45.  Luckily, I had fixed my old speedometer, and swapped it back at lunchtime.
 No probs so far, and IT WORKS!
    The differences between what I got at the swap meet and the speedometer I
had in the car are on the front of the unit.  The needle is a formed plastic
piece with two metal weights, instead of painted soft metal.  Also, there was
only one piece of metal holding the glass bezel on, instead of two.  It was not
as soft as the other, and was more difficult to pry off.
    I guess I agree that I could have fixed the thing without taking the dial
face off, but if you do that you have to be very careful to keep the correct
orientation of the rollers.
    Removing the steering wheel is in fact not necessary, nor is removing the
instrument cluster.  I was able to reach up from underneath the dashboard to
push the instrument out.  Of course, you get a bit more working room when you
take the panel off--not much, but every bit helps.  My speedo cable had been
incorrectly routed when I bought the car, and I moved it to another incorrect
place when I did the first swap.  There is a cut-out in one of the "beams" that
holds the bottom of the dashboard which fits the cable nicely.  A "channel" in
the sheet metal goes above the steering (bar? column?) which also is the right
size for the cable.
    Of course, my speedo reads even lower now.  I went past one of those radar
trailers which posts your speed.  My 40 = their 35.  Oh, well, hopefully it'll
help keep me out of trouble.

I have Comp T/A 3 225-60/16-ZR on a '79 928. They are very good in the
dry and phenomenal in the wet (where it really counts). After 5k miles they
don't look worn. They are worse than useless on ice or wet snow - this could
be as much the car as the tire width. My local independent dealer put the 
tires on mounted and spin balanced, disposed of the old tires, for $160 each
taxes included (8%). This was less than $20 a tire different from mail order 
before shipping and a whole lot less aggravation.

I shopped Yokohama, Pirelli and Goodyear Eagle. The Comp T/A 
represented a genuine good deal, not just a cheap alternative. 

I did see an article about a new Bridgestone all weather ZR tire that
looked interesting; They claimed to have good ice performance
despite the width of the contact patch.

more to discourage you from working on the wiring.

There was a catalytic converter at the automotion swap meet 9 days

probably be a few at the Carlsen swap meet in July or August.  Of

On solution I have seen is to mount the changer in the spare tire well.
The tire/wheel mount on one side and the CD changer mounts directly to
the sheet metal on the other side.  The only problem is that the changer
needs to be easy to remove so you can use you spare.

Saratoga makes a high-quality close-to-transparent "plastic" i.e. Lexan

You used to be able to get them for all flavors, but the only things
I routinely see available are the sunroof inserts these days. The 914
roof hasn't been available for a long time. 

They're nice, because it's like adding a tinted glass top to your car. 
You can see out, you get extra light, but you don't get exposed to the

Should be able to find their ads in Pano, and most of the "big" aftermarket

Subject: 1976 912E


One of my favorite road Porsches is the 1976 912E. I think people
are usually first attracted by 930 Turbos, or one of the fibreglass
race models, but as one reflects on the marque you begin to 
appreciate the subtle aspects of design.

Now I don't own one, and I've only seen a couple floating around. I
understand that they're quite collectable now, fetching the same
price or *higher* as its 6 cylinder sister, the 911. For those who
aren't familiar with the 912E, it is basically a 1976 911 with a
4 cylinder VW 411 engine. The "regular" 912's disappeared from the
lineup since 1969, and the 912E was a one-year-only variant, hence its
rarity.

Some things I like about it (over the 6 cylinder): **
	
	*Low cost VW powerplant.
	*Lighter-weight than the 911.
	*Better fuel economy.

I'm curious to know if any porschephiles bought one of these new, or
even walked into a dealership in 1976 when they were being sold. I'd
like to know how they were being marketed at the dealership level, and
what practical considerations would drive one to buy one. 


- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
** The earlier 912's offered the same advantages as the 912E but I'm
really curious about the 1976 model because the times were alot
different than in 1969 in terms of sports car purchase and competition
from other manufacturers.

Hello everyone, I recently bought a 911SC that has been lowered.
I would like to raise it back to the original height. Is this
something a shade tree mechanic can do it himself? If someone
has done this before please email procedure suggestion etc. 

On a more general topic, having never own a Porsche before, what

Subject: Porsche 944 - a wealth of tech info


Hello porschephiles,

The following technical information is reprinted with permission from
"Import Service" magazine, April 1993 issue.**

The article is simply called "944" and gives technical advice for pros
on what to look for on the 944 series. 24 tips are given, complete
with photos. I have reprinted here the one's I think are most
interesting to the porschephiles. My comments follow the text with
a *.

Photos have been omitted for obvious reasons but are described
in brackets [] where necessary.

Feel free to comment or correct any discrepancies you may catch.
I have scanned the photos and will talk to Stan about posting on 
the server. Stay tuned for more info. I'll also compile the additions
and comments and archive it for future reference.

======================== begin article ====================================

Porsche 944 Tech Tips (24):

1. Watch out for weak hood supports. You'll raise the hood and 
start to work. The hood will stay put until you decide to 
raise the lift. The vibration of the moving lift can cause the 
hood to drop suddenly. Any bulky objects you left behind will
leave a lasting impression in the sheetmetal.
*This also applies to lifting on a floor jack, be careful.

2. There have been a number of bulletins about water pumps. Many 
pumps were replaced when a small discoloration appeared around
the pump housing weep hole (arrow). This dampness does not 
necessarily mean the pump is bad. Our photo shows a disassembled 
pump replaced for a more serious leak. 

3. Cam, crank, and balance shaft seals may need service as often as 
every 30,000 miles. Neglected leaks will ruin the cam and balance
shaft belts. This is also a good time to replace that suspect 
water pump, since leaks from a bad pump will run down behind the 
timing cover and go unnoticed until it's too late. 
*Remember to use the updated belt part-number, especially on 'S'
 models.

4. This 944 is in for its 15,000 mile cam and balance shaft belt
adjustments. The cam belt is adjusted by loosening and then 
retightening the mounting bolts on the spring tensioner (arrow). 
Loosening the bolts allows the spring to pull the tensioner toward 
the belt, removing slack from the belt. 
[photo shows the automatic belt tensioner mechanism on '87 and later
 models with arrow pointing at tensioner.]
*Do not be mislead. This procedure only applies to '87 and later
 with the automatic tensioner. Earlier models must be set manually
 with a special tool.

5. Adjust balance shaft tension at this eccentric (left arrow). The 
idler pulley (right arrow) just barely contacts the center section 
of a freshly adjusted belt. As the belt stretches, the pulley 
dampens any "wow and flutter" which will develop in the long belt 
section between the sprockets. 
[photo shows the tiny plastic "floating" pully.]
*This refers to the balance shaft belt *only*.

6. Some early engines (up to '86) experienced heavy seepage and
overheating caused by-leaking head gaskets. There are two other 
common oil leaks to keep in mind. Rear seals on cam cases should 
always be checked. Oil pan gaskets on cars without this heat shield 
(arrow) will crack when over-cooked. 
[view from underneath.]

7. Low oil pressure in early engines was sometimes caused by sticking
pressure relief valves (left). The steel relief piston/spring in the 
oil cooler would gall and stick. Porsche later introduced a one piece 
relief valve into production. It is available as a retofit for the 
earlier style valve. 
*Easier said then done. It's a bit hard to get to.

8. Engine oil passes through an oil cooler in the oil filter flange
assembly. Engine coolant and oil circulate through the cooler. Seals 
in the cooler which separate the water and oil can deteriorate, 
allowing oil and coolant to mix. Improved seals were introduced to 
correct this problem. 
*This is a chronic problem. Check your coolant mixture for signs of
oil. First manifestation is a frothy oily residue in the reservoir.

9. Oil cooler leaks were common on '851/2 to '88 cars. Failing to correct
the problem results in engine bearing damage (commonly number two 
rod bearing). Increased cooling system pressure, starting with the 
1985 1/2 car, only made matters worse. Some 944s with low mileage
still have the old seals.

10. The cooler is like a small radiator. It sits inside the housing shown
in photo 8. Replacement seals are green in color (top arrow). The 
bosses at the other end (bottom arrow) locate and center the cooler 
between  the engine block and housing. Keep track of any shims on the 
bosses and reinstall them.
[photo shows the oil cooler removed from housing]
*It is also possible that the cooler itself is cracked and may need
 replacement. If in doubt have it pressure tested.

11. Even if the engine hasn't been damaged by the effeets of an
oil/coolant mix, odds are good that the rubber coolant hoses have been
ruined. Hoses will crack on the inside first, even though they may 
look okay from the outside. Bad hoses will often feel soft and spongy 
when squeezed. 

12. The 944 has an upstream test pipe for checking and adjusting CO. Early
pipes rusted away, and a retrofit stainless steel pipe was introduced.
Make sure you replace a broken pipe. Exhaust pulses will turn the leak
into a pulse air system. The extra oxygen sucked into the exhaust will
fool the oxygen sensor. 
[arrow in photo points to test pipe in engine bay.]

13. Test pipes can break in a number of places. Support brackets (arrow)
can vibrate loose, and pipes can crack down low, out of sight-so look 
sharp. False air and an ignition miss sent some catalysts into melt 
down. Bang on the cat with a soft mallet to see if the old honeycomb 
now rattles like a large rock. 

14. False air can also be drawn into a cracked exhaust manifold between
cylinders one and four. Early cars had cast iron manifolds. This 
stamped steel manifold was used starting with the 1985 1/2 models. 
Expansion and contraction of the pipe leads to a crack in the "crotch"
of the pipe (arrow). 
[photo shows cracked exhaust manifold]
*Check you manifold for cracks. Chances are there's a hairline crack
if it's an older car.

15. A number of heat shields were used to protect components from high
exhaust temperatures. The shield at right is a starter shield, and 
it has cracked (arrow), causing a loud buzzing during downshifts at 
high RPM. The oil filter housing shield to the left has a missing 
stand-off bracket. 
[nice photo of typical break points on these parts]

16. Clutch replacements should go beyond a disc and pressure plate. The
release bearing is pulled by this release arm. Clutch debris ruins 
the needle bearings, and the pivot shaft galls like a universal 
joint on your old Chevy pickup. Failing to correct this will result 
in notchy clutch application. 
[photo shows release arm (fork)]

17. Non-turbo cars use a rubber damper hub in the center of the clutch
disc which can crack. Then, when you let off the clutch pedal, 
there's a loud clunk as the center section bangs against its stops. 
This is the turbo clutch. Its damper springs are so worn, they're 
spinning (shiny spots, arrows). 
[photo shos the spring centered disc.]
* Upgrade the rubber centered on non-turbo cars to avoid this 
 problem of center blowout.

18. This snout centers the release bearing. Note the wear pattem
highlighted by our arrow. If you don't replace the snout as part of 
a complete clutch job, the release bearing can cut all the way 
through before the next clutch job. Our host shop has found the 
severed ends inside clutch assemblies. 
*This is a great tip! Commonly overlooked.

19. Another fairly common clutch related problem has to do with the rubber
hose between the clutch master and slave cylinder. The hoses will 
warn you that they're going bad by leaving a trace of moist brake 
fluid in the part of the hose right next to the crimped metal ends.	

20. Engine mounts are fluid filled to absorb engine vibration. Fatigued or
leaking mounts can transmit a nasty vibration through the chassis to 
the cabin. This vibration may be mistaken for a rough idle, even 
though the engine may be running just fine. The right side mount seems
to be the first to go bad.	
*A well addressed chronic problem of this series. Update to the turbo-
 style with heat shield.

21. Worn constant velocity joints can cause a driveline vibration similar
to the shudder caused by a weak center support bearing on car with a 
two-piece driveshaft. Lead-footed-owners of turbo models may 
"accelerate" this wear and need replacement joints as soon as 50,000 
miles. Play and pay. 
[photo shows worn inner race of CV joint]

22. Distributor caps and plug wires seem to last, but distributor rotors
can cause problems. Some rotors have been known to disintegrate. 
Surprisingly, they may keep working, but cold driveability problems 
result. When replacing a rotor, make sure you're using the upgraded 
part number to avoid problems.
*Another great tip!

23. If the high pressure A/C hose between the condenser and compressor
splits open (or just plain bursts) check the high side pressure 
when the compressor cycles OFF. A replacement switch with a lower 
high side pressure is available. It shuts off the compressor before 
high side pressures get too high. 
[photo shows switch location]

24. Discharged batteries are sometimes caused by an overdose of
aftermarket add-on accessories. Bolt in a cellular phone, burglar 
alarm, 800 giga watt stereo, and a Mr. Coffee, and the battery gets 
a little stressed out. Parasitic draw should be checked, and ideally 
stay in the 90 milliamp range.

Subject: Alternator warning light.


Hello everyone, first let me apology to the group if any
of the question that I've been posting has been discussed
before. As you can see by my recent slew of posting, I'm
a new owner of an 80-911SC. Anyway here are some more 
questions.

1_ The alternator warning light comes on (dimly) while
   driving. It turns off when the engine's speed is above 
   4500 RPM. I check the V-belt and it looks ok. Does
   this mean something wrong with the alternator or regu-
   lator? How can I check them? Has anyone replace/repair
   both of these components? Please email procedure or
   source for procedure.

2_ When the ignition switch is in the on position, a very
   high pitch noise is generated somewhere in the engine
   compartment. It continue to be generated when the engine
   is running. Has anyone running into this problem before?
   If yes what is it and how do I fix it?

3_ How does one go about lowering the idle speed?

4_ Is it possible for a shade-tree mechanic to perform
   a tune-up on this engine? Please email procedure. I
   have the Bruce Anderson book, but it does not have
   procedure for this.

5_ How do I go about raising the car 1-2 inches? It's
   been lowered.

As always, many thanks for any reply.

A VW 411 engine in the 912E? Not exactly.....Porsche had a couple
of thousand 2.0 liter fuel injected engines available after they
discontinued the 914 2.0. Guess what they decided to do with the
engines???

A 912E in perfect condition will fetch as much as the same year
911. The 75-76 911s had smog/heat/size related problems that
generally has kept their value down.

I doubt that they will be "collectibles" in the near future.
Even the very rare 914-6 has not attained that status.
Prices have actually dropped in the last 10 years (accounting
for inflation). At some point, values will increase and the
914-6 and 912E will be "collectibles." Remember what happened
right after Enzo Ferrari died? Used Ferraris went throught the sunroof!
A 1972 246GT I was eyeing for 22K (mint condition) suddenly was
45K! Maybe when Porsche dies, and the directors sell the comapny
to Ford and we see the Porsche-Escort 989GTI on the road......B-(

   I've got a couple of 944 questions:

  1. Does anyone know the part number for the turbo style (spring center
     rather than rubber) to update to (it's an '86)?

  2. Is there a way to replace the ball joint or at least the rubber seal
     on the 951 style (aluminum) front A-arms?

  3. Can the automatic belt tensioner ('87 on) be retrofitted to the 
     earlier 944s (specifically, '86 non turbo)?

This sounds like the CD ignition unit. Listen carefully for the
sound coming from a finned aluminum box on the drivers side 
engine comparment wall. The box measures approximately 6"x4"x2".
This whine noise is normal for it.

   3_ How does one go about lowering the idle speed?

There is a throttle bypass screw on the throttle body, located
mid/left of the main injection air boot. But be careful, because
the elevated idle could be due to a number of factors, including
vacuum leak and/or sticky throttle (common).

Regarding the 1976 912E:

Yup. Standard type thing: someone realized they're relatively rare,
and decided that they must be valuable as a result...

>Some things I like about it (over the 6 cylinder): **
>	
>	*Low cost VW powerplant.

Hmmmm. Low cost relative to the 911, but higher cost than the 914 2.0
that it's based on. The EFI is *ALL* different, as are most of the
plumbing and wiring components. So if you throw a rod, it's not too
bad, but it you break your EFI you might have a hard time with it...

I was hoping that these guys would make it into EProduction class, since
I know a lot about driving 911s, and a lot about building 914s. Sort of an
ideal combination car... 

Anyway, the original 912 handled *MUCH* better than the original 911, as 
it made less power. Believe it or not, that made a huge difference on the 
relatively undersprung short wheelbase original body.

Besides, the original 912 *sounded* like a "real Porsche" i.e. the 356,
because well, it had a 356 engine. No one really wanted to count the
911 as a "real Porsche" for a *LONG* time.

However, the real reason for the 912 was that the 911 was significantly
more expensive than a 356SC with all the options you could put on it.
And most of the cost difference was in the engine compartment. Soooo, by
taking advantage of the relatively low cost of the 356 engine, the
price of the 912 was brought down into 356 territory. Porsche did this
to keep their customer base. Period. Otherwise, you would have to wait
a *LONG* time and think *REAL* hard about trading your 356B T-5 in on
a new 911, whereas it wasn't that much of a reach to do so for a 356C or
SC. Might even decide to buy something else, yup yup...

[Aside: how many of you who own late 911SCs or pre-'90 Carreras are
thinking about trading your car in for a new C2 or C4? Any hands up
out there? How about someone elses less expensive, better performing
sports car, like a Mitsu 3000GTV+4? Or a much-less-expensive sports
car like a Miata? Hope this is making the point... Porsche seems to
have forgotten a *LOT* of their history in the last few years...]

The 912E though was driven by exactly the same circumstances. The 914
sold more copies than any Porsche model to date -- even the 356! And
it did so despite being (in the opinion of the auto press) "butt-ugly".
And even more amazing, it did so in the period of 7 years vs. the 15+
years the 356 was made. Hmmmm. Why? Well, it was *CHEAP*, for a Porsche.

But after '75, really, no more 914. The '76s were basicly '75 production
that hadn't gotten badged for '75 serial numbers yet. So no more cheap
Porsche.... But wait, we have this warehouse full of 914 parts, and
hmmm, didn't we do this in '65????

So the 912E was born. Difference was, it just didn't perform as well
as the 912 did relative to the 911. The '76 911 made about 150HP. The
912E made about 85-90. *BIG* differene from the early 911 that made
100-110, and the 912 that made 90 on an engine that was known to make
95-100 in 356SC trim, and for which those same parts were still available.
And the body was *MUCH* heavier as well, like some 400 lbs more than
the original 912. So it pretty much sucked, relative to the 911. For
that matter, relative to the original 912!

I've driven 912Es, and have cannibalized 912E EFI systems for use in
various race projects. I'd like to see them remain available and 
affordable, but I don't think I want to see one in my garage.

Yes, this part is about 12" in diameter and 2-3" thick and circular,
like a disk. Most of it is made of very hard rubber which is tapered
thin toward the outer diameter. The center has splines for the drive-
shaft and the outer edge is bonded to a metal band which bolts to the
torque convertor on automatic 924's. It apparently dampens the 
torsional oscillations between the driveshaft and the transmission.
They (unfortunately) fail rather frequently by shearing apart into
big chunks of rubber. Like the 944 rubber centered clutch there is
a metal "stop" which prevents total loss of drive but produces a
"clunking" noise. If a used one is in good shape I see no reason
not to get it, since it is not a wear part. But if the rubber is
cracking or brittle stay away from it. This is one of those parts
that you say "Sheesh, *why* did they do it this way" because it's
so expensive. I think its only available at the dealer at around
$900 or so.

Whoa! Just a second here.  Where do you think a 914 2.0 fuel injected
motor comes from? Correct me if I'm wrong but the 914 2.0 liter I am
building is guess what?.... A vw 411 (a.k.a. type IV). Granted
Porsche used some different parts (pistons, crank, rods, better
flowing heads) than the 1.7 and 1.8 engines. But the crank and rods
are the same used in the late ('72 & later) VW bus motors, and the case
is the same too. There are plenty of other differences between the 2.0
and the 1.7 and 1.8 motors but many of these differences are shared
with the 2.0 fuel injected bus motor.

Stan might be able to shed more light on this subject as he knows much
more than I do. I'm just talking from my personal experience.

Hi

Does anyone have any tips for 944 A/C repair?  Any success repairing the
hoses with kits available?  The hose that's leaking on mine is $280 not to
mention a new drier ($160) plus the problem of getting R12.

Thanks

At least here in sunny, hot Austin, there are a multitude of A/C
repair shops which are capable of fabricating hoses.  I think 
you could have this done for much less than $280 (assuming Porsche
didn't use some hose spec'd for the space program).

From what various mechanics have told me, it's almost certainly
the hose.  I don't have any tips about the drier, but I suspect
a reputable A/C shop might be able to find a substitute.

1.7's are identical to 411, except the 411 used AFC and the 914 used
MPC injection. 1.8 is pretty close to identical to 412, no major differences.
But the 2.0, well, that's  different. Where to start: the casting is the same 
for the case, but the serial number range is different. Not terribly important 
unless it happens to be important, but hey, sometimes it is...

Pistons are NOT the same, but the piston size is. Bus pistons are lower
compression and heavier. Not sure why, but... Crank and rods are the
same, at least in all of the engines I've opened.

Cam, needless to say, is different. But cam gear is the same. Lifters, push
rods, and bearings are the same. 

Heads and the rest of the induction side is *WAY* different. From valve
springs to valves to head porting to number of studs on the head, it's
all different.... Even spacing on the exhaust ports, so you can't
just bolt one of these guys into your Type IV and smoke your buddies...

Flywheel is different, but you can use either the Type IV or the 914
flywheel on either engine. Just match flywheel/clutch to the *car* not
motor...

The way I've heard it is that the 1.7 was pretty much a pure VW motor, that
the 1.8 was Porsche telling VW how to fix their crummy 1.7, and the 2.0 was
pure Porsche (in the best possible sense of the word -- they scavenged someone
else's parts bin for some stuff, invented some stuff, and pretended other
stuff just wasn't important...).
