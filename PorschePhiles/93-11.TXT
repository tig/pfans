Regarding John Colasante's comment about hearse colored 914s...

Our 1971 914-6 still has the FACTORY ORIGINAL black paint on it.  If
anyone has said it was hearse-like, they must have been shouting it
as we zoomed away. ;-)

I get a kick out of the 70s colors 914s came in.  They are one of the
few cars that can get away with chartreuse paint.  Most other cars
look ghastly in such colors.  But I wouldn't trade my black 914-6
for anything!

Subject: After the accident


So, after the accident .. What happens next?


Had a little argument with a wall today.
It pushed the left front corner back and right.
Plus ruptured the radiator or a hose. Hood shifted up
but the catch is jammed so haven't been able to inspect
the whole damage yet. 

I get to check out the Bay area body shop thread for a
source of estimates, anyway!

I am guessing that the car may be close to a write-off
 - an '87 944S, worth $11,000 or so,

So, apart from calling the insurance agent (AAA) what
would fellow porschephiles suggest? 

What are the steps needed to ensure a fair settlement?
Plus what not to do?

Accepting the towing company's offer of storage and their
estimate for the repair was one pitfall I sidestepped
already ... ;-)

Can I expect the Insurance Co. loss adjustor to agree
to use a Porsche dealer's estimate of repair cost, or
auto value, etc.


All advice gratefully received ...

It should be pointed out that neither Joe Danaher nor those dominating RX7s were
able to win the Firehawk Sports division championship.  The final race of the 
season was a 12hr one and there were no RX7s left at the end for Joe to climb 
into to earn the final points he needed to win the title.  His co-driver Peter 
Farrell was not permitted to drive due to a disqualification suffered earlier in
the year. Joe talked to his old team running Oldsmobiles and they gave him a 
ride, but even without the RX7s around his final position was not good enough. 
The Sports division was won by a Honda Prelude - not the RX7.

Porsche competes in the Grand Sports division and won with one of those 944S2s 
with a 4 cylinder engine - maybe not dead yet.  Also I think Porsche finished 
third place thru seventh place mainly in 968s -more of those 4 cylinders.  
Second place went to a Pontiac Firebird which is the car that ended the reign of
domination by Porsche.  Porsche still dominates endurance racing because they 
just go forever with little pit work required.  This year they suffered overall 
because IMSA shortened most of the races and the new Pontiac V8s were very 
quick.

Keep in mind that IMSA constantly changes the weight that the various cars must 
carry and will not allow any one make to dominate forever.  There are a lot of 
variables that determime who wins the titles, but one thing should be obvious 
and that is the reliability of the Porsches.  They are always there at the end.

Yes Ferg, '84 Carreras do have a drain plug on the side of the case.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now for your help:

I noticed that my '84 Carrera Targa has developed a slight FE play. I was able
to trace it to the right tie rod. Specifically, the end of the tie rod that
attaches to the steering rack.  Left side checks ok.

I believe there is a rubber isolated joint, designed to eliminate road shocks 
up through the steering wheel. I looked at some aftermarket supplier catalogs
and they are not advertising the part, just outer tie rods or complete assembly. 
Does any one know if you can just buy this inner tie rod part? The car has only 
26K miles on it. I feel no play on the actual tie rod end that attaches to the
wheel carrier. 

After looking at some catalogs, I saw pictures of "Turbo" tie rods. They seem to
be threaded to the steering rack. Looking at Hayne's manual seems to confirm
this. Does any one have any experience replacing/removing the tie rod?

Specifically, what size of wrench do you need to remove the inner part from the 
rack? I'm assumming that the whole tie rod must come out to replace the inner
part. There is a rubber booth covering the part, that seems to be held in place
with a spring. Can this be peeled back to get to the tie rod/rack attachment
point?

I know I will have to do a wheel alignment after the part is replaced.

Has anyone encountered this type of FE play in their cars? 26K miles seems low 
for this malady! Any experiences with "Turbo" tie rods? Pictures seem to show
a metal/metal joint replacing the metal/rubber joint on non-Turbo models.

Your help is appreciated!

My '73 911T is Blutorange - great colour, my personal favourite (well, I am

is not red but tangerine!

Was there ever an RS in this colour, if so what was the style of trim

Subject:  86' 944 turbo Wheel Shimmy

I removed the front wheels to inspect the brake pads, after I replaced the pads
and sensors, I then replaced the wheels. Each wheel was put back on the same
side it came off of. After I did this, when I would reach 60+ mph I noticed a
shimmy in the steering wheel which previously 
was not there. As far as I can see all balance weights are still intact.I did
not put the wheels on the hub exactly as they were,is this critical? I also
used a torque wrench set @ 45 ft. lbs. per spec. ,and cross tightned all lug
nuts. Is ths a common problem when removing wheels, for I've heard that front
end shimmy in early 944's was a problem? If this helps I Have 16" "phone dial

    Just a quick note of concern re German/Eurpoean video:  A
    few months ago a friend of mine sent me a video he made (in car at
    Nurburgring, etc.).  The tape, however, would not play in my
    machine despite switching it from LP to SP to EP, etc.  Finally I
    brought it to a video repair place and the guy said European
    standard is different and that the tape needed to be
    "translatted" before I could play it. $20 later the
    copied version worked.  This may or may not be a problem with the
    911 video but I thought I'd just give the heads up (not to mention
    that if it is a problem and you can't watch it on your machine
    at home you will have to have it translated, but to do so you have
    to have it copied, which will certainly violate Porsche's
    copyright protection).

    If anyone does get this video (I am tempted), please let me know
    if it works and if it is worth the 59DM.

Also, the bright yellow color is just called "Light Yellow" 
There is a plate attached to the chassis that says "KUNTZHARZLACK"
with a paint code for the original color. Mine (on a 911) is on the
driver's side door frame on the hinge side.

The late '60's and early '70's colors were considered safety colors
at the time, and I think they still look great on the track. I get
strong reactions BOTH ways to my light yellow color, but no one is
ever neutral.

I missed the thread on cost of painting when I was out last week, but
you generally get what you pay for. A Porsche that obviously looks 
repainted is devalued by several thousand dollars, so it's a "pay me now 
or pay me later" issue. The value and collectability of your
car is a consideration. A $7,000 paint job on a '73 911RS might not be 
enough, whereas not too many people would spend that amount on a
high volume, non collectable model.

Often times you can work with a shop and do a lot of the labor intensive 
stuff like clean-up and disassembly/reassembly yourself. That will cut
the cost by approx. 30-40% and allow you to get an outstanding 
value-preserving paint job for the cost of painting a normal car.

Subject: car jackings

I was just reading my Chicago Tribune and there is going to be this new
product on the market.  Basically, it is some type of thine film clear
adhesive coating that is put onto your windows.  When the window is hit by
a would be car jacker with a tire iron, basball bat, rock, etc...the
window does not shatter.  In fact, ll you get is this whole layer of
shattered glass that I wouldn't want to stick my finger through.  The product
is not designed to stand up forever to unlimited blows from whatever the
car jacker is swinging.

it is however designed to give you enough time to wake out of your stupor and shock and get teh pedal to the metal.  For example, only after 8 blows from
a tire iron...did a small hold large enough to put one's hand through
appear.  

the article mentioned that for a chevy cavalier, the treatment of all side
window would cost approx $200.  Other cars would vary according to surface
areas,etc.  The company did not recommend coating the front windshiel
as supposedly most cars today have a front windshield already manufactured
not to break and scatter in a million pieces, but this would obviously
not apply to old vintage porsches.

the only problem with the product?  what if u drove off a cliff in CA and
your door was stuck and the windows were jammed?  But then that's like
saying u won't were your seatbelt becasue it wrinkles your suit.  Anyways,
if i was in a bad area...i'd take my chances and get this product.  I'm
typing from memory and with little sleep...sorry about the post length.

I think the body panels and glass are ok, but didn't look closely.  One

As you suspect, you should be able to put the wheel on any way you please
(except, of course, inside out :-).

Actually the spec. for 944/951 lug nuts is more like 95 ft. lbs. This is
likely your problem, if it is not a typo. Front end shimmy is not a common
problem on these cars.

If the lug torque is not the problem then it sounds like your brake disk
may be unbalanced. Perhaps the wheel was previously balanced "on the car"
with a dynamic balancer??? There are spring-like pieces of wire stuck up
into the inside of disks to balance them. They sometimes fall out. For me,
I've had at least one fall out of a rear disk (haven't felt any big
vibration back there, though). In your case, assuming the wheel was
dynamically balanced, there are four other possible positions for the
wheel. I would rotate it two lugs and try again. If this does help then
look for reasons to replace the front rotors (like measure the thickness of
them...).

Hope this helps.

It can make a difference. Check your wheel studs to see if one is
painted for each wheel. It should line up with the closest hole to
the valve stem.

Regarding the HRS wheel locks, I used them for 2 or 3 years and
they wore out. The holes elongated around the pins and they just
fell out. I was afraid that the tool would get so bad that I 
couldn't get my wheels off, so I quit using them. This was caused
primarily by using the removal tool without bothering to tighten it 
down over the nut (impatience) I wasn't too concerned because I
never heard of anyone stealing cookie cutters - until today. Those
wheels were probably sitting in the bushes while the purps had 
another joint, trying to figure out how to get 4 studs into 5 
holes!  - or maybe they got someone else's struts the day before.

*************************************************************************

If anyone is interested:

PAL refers to several similar standards, B, I, G, D, K.

In general, PAL = European Television, except for France which is SECAM.

PAL = 50hz vertical, 15625hz horizontal, 625 lines per picture frame.

NTSC = USA Television = 60hz vertical, 15750hz horizontal
      525 lines per picture frame. 

I found that PAL has a noticeably better picture than NTSC.

I was old enough to drive, but not to buy. Now that I am,
I chose one of those "ugly" colors.

It seems to be an American thing to only like red, white, black
or silver Porsches. In Europe, you see some really interesting 
car colors, especially a medium-dark blue that looks very sharp
on all models from 356's to present. About the only color that 
still looks strange to me is that aubergine (eggplant purple)
 - especially when combined with the op-art interior in a 928.

When people ask me what color my car is, I say "certainly yellow"
because of all the times perfect strangers have come up to me and
said "wow, that car is certainly yellow!" I get thumbs up everywhere
I go, and my wife won't drive the car because "everyone stares at her"
So, ugly as they may be to some people, Porsche created some cars that 
demand to be noticed.

Hello!

Here's my experience w/ my 1.8L:

1)  Look out for the little O-ring seals that are seated in the manifolds.
You probably want to replace these to avoid air leaks.  I usually put a little
grease on them and placed the ring on the injector before installation.

2)  Plug the hole left by the injector!  I used a small piece of rolled up
cloth.  This prevents *crap* from finding it's way into the cylinder.  (and it
*will* get in there otherwise - see all the sandblasting stories in the 
archieves! (and I've got a *motor locked up* story to add to that!)

3)  You probably want to replace the short rubber hoses that go from the
injector to the manifold.  I didn't once...  Lucky for me it sprang a leak 
while still in the shop!  Disturbing that old rubber is always risky.  Be sure
to use something rated for the high-pressure of the system (40+ psi)

4)  Don't drop the 10 mm nuts and washers!  They can go all sorts of places in
a 914 engine compartment!

It's been about 4 years since I've done this so might have missed something.
Use some common sense and watch out for gas leaks.  You can avoid a *spurt* of 
gas when you break open the line by disabling the fuel pump and running the car
till it stops.  You will still get some spillage but it won't be as bad.

Good Luck!

    Just a quick note of concern re German/Eurpoean video:  A
    few months ago a friend of mine sent me a video he made (in car at
    Nurburgring, etc.).  The tape, however, would not play in my
    machine despite switching it from LP to SP to EP, etc.  Finally I
    brought it to a video repair place and the guy said European
    standard is different and that the tape needed to be
    "translatted" before I could play it. $20 later the
    copied version worked.  This may or may not be a problem with the
    911 video but I thought I'd just give the heads up (not to mention
    that if it is a problem and you can't watch it on your machine
    at home you will have to have it translated, but to do so you have
    to have it copied, which will certainly violate Porsche's
    copyright protection).

    If anyone does get this video (I am tempted), please let me know
    if it works and if it is worth the 59DM.

    Thanks

which are not compatable with U.S. VHS standards.  You will have to convert

Don't believe that Mercenary ad.  I got the 928 version of the
tracks, installed them, and I found out after my first 35 mph
run over and through tollbooths at Exit 24 of the NYS Thruway
that Panzerwaggon Retro did a half-assed job engineering the
bogies and tensioners that guide the top track underneath the
bodywork.  I now have a nice 2" long gouge in the new cammo
paintwork of my 87 GTS due to a collapsed bogie and loosened
tensioner, and have a bit of undercarriage welding work to
do. Sheesh.  You can order the track kit from:

	Panzerwaggon Retro, GmBH
	Gottmitunsstrasse
	D-45293 Berlin
	Germany

Be prepared to supply your Dealer In Munitions ID upon request.

Instead of the 25mm gun I installed the .223 Gatling gun on a
remote gymbal slaved to an iris tracker, such that I only need
look at a target to aim the weapon.  Acceleration is a
bit off from the weight of the continuous-feed 2000-rd belt,
but I don't really miss it.

Mileage has actually improved because now I can literally slice
through even stop-n-go traffic and maintain a constant -
and fuel-efficient - 75 mph.

As always, your milage may vary.

Either you have steamroller tires with twice normal radius, you have
a fuel cell that holds 30 gallons or you only travel downhill. I haven't 
seen any 911 that will average 40MPG!

My best mileage, cross-country was approx. 26 MPG and in mixed driving
I get 14 to 19 depending on how heavy my foot feels. My cruising range,

Let's not get everyone confused.  The Automotion locks are the
ones with pins (that apparently wore out).  The HRS locks have
no pins at all, just a uniquely-shaped  blunt male end that won't
accept a standard lug wrench.  Place the "key" female end over
male before using a std lug wrench.

I actually used that setup (attaching shoulder harness to rear seat attach
points) in my SC last year, which seemed to work fine.  The problem here, is
that the RS doesn't have any rear seats.  In place of the seats exists two
storage bins (now inaccessable due to the roll bar).  Originally, my plan 

was to use the same setup in the RS as I did in the SC (no roll bar needed).
Upon closer inspection, I found that I'd have to cut through carpet and the
top of the storage bin (wood) in order to get to the attach points.  Since
I intended upon using the car at the track, I opted for an Autopower bar which
would give me the attach point for the shoulder harness and a mounting place
for a camera and fire extinguisher.  I could take out the storage bins behind
the seat if it's possible to do so without destroying them or tearing up the
carpet....Hmmm, I'll have to check out this option...

There are a couple of guys here locally who have invested a hellatious amount 

of money on upgrades on their RS Americas for club racing.  Both replaced the
stock seats with SPG's (in the Kevlar version) for this purpose, but neither
are used on the street.  As long as the factory restraint system can be used

Subject: INSURANCE CLAIM, PORSCHE

OUCH!  So many Porsches getting wrecked amongst this crowd!  Careful!!

Whilst I owned my '81 928 I was whacked by another car run amok.  A few
lessons learned may be in order.  First, assuming you have reasonably good
insurance (AAA of Northern California is reputed to be quite good, I had
Farm Bureau, they think Porsche is a rare tractor but pay well, lots of
combines costs more than Porsches).  Rule #1:  Press the rental agency for
a like-replacement.  I negotiated up from an econobox (Mazda 323ish) to
a pseudo-sport sedan (Celica) with the insurance company taking the hit.
Rule #2:  Demand Porsche replacement parts.  It is your right.  Sometimes
the insurance company will push the repair shop towards non-Porsche parts
(unless its a Porsche dealer, then PCNA supposedly threatens to yank their
distributorship).  Rule #3:  Get a police record ... only somewhat non-
biased person involved at the scene, often.  Rule #4:  Ask how long the
insurance company will pay for the rental, they may well neglect to tell
you that your time ran out weeks ago!  Rule #5:  When the work is done,
ask the people involved in the repair if you oughta sell the car ASAP
or keep it, if it is marginal they will recommend sell (sometimes).

Whatever, good luck!

Oh, I think Pano just had an article entitled "Confessions of an
Insurance Man" or something close within the last few months.

US VHS tapes are recorded in NTSC format. That does NOT imply that a
European NTSC tape will work, though, as they may have a funny encoding scheme.
Check the big video stores, as they often have conversion services. I've
seen $25 quoted.

Porschephiles,

Steven Stomski's format problems were caused by trying to
play a European PAL format tape on our NTSC equipment.

Most companies that distribute tapes to International
customers can supply either format (or a third format, 
SECAM, used mostly in France) 

Although the cost of conversion equipment has come down,
it's not unusual to pay $1.00 per minute of recorded
tape for format conversion, because it has to be done 
"real time"

That can be avoided by asking for 1/2" NTSC format tapes.

Michael -

The shimmy problem really existed only for the MY82 and 83 944 cars.  It
was largely cured with the advent of power steering for MY84, and was
also helped by an updated so-called "flexible" tie rod design.

Correct torque for your wheels is 96 ftlb, and the fact that you've
undertorqued them may be the root cause of your problem.  In fact, when
mounting them you should first snug all five lug nuts to, say, 20 to 30
ftlb, then retorque to 96.  This is important because it centres the lug
hole at each lug bolt; note the conical shape to the nut's bearing
surface.  It's also important that you always tighten in a "star"
pattern, like drawing a pentagram.

Hope this helps,

It does not work if it is not in NTSC format, we Europeans mostly have
PAL. I'd guess Porsche is making this tape in NTSC too.

Some of the more modern VCR's *do* have switching possibillities between

Thanks, Scott. I couldn't remember the name of mine and it 
sounded the same from the description posted. Mine had a key
with approx. 6 uniquely spaced pins which fitted into the hemi-
sperical piece that stayed on the stud. A hex cap then screwed
onto the stud so that the lock was looked identical to the other
wheel nuts.  Sorry for the confusion.

Correct me if I am wrong but arn't we talking about the 2nd generation

to compete in any Firehawk races. In the On Track magazine I have always

The Hazet Assistant is a beautiful light-blue colored folding toolbox
which is on wheels and has three collapsing trays and side posts which
collapses down on itself into a very small package. The top shelf also
doubles as a temporary work surface in the upright position and the
numerous small compartments in the thing can hold most of your
frequently used hand tools. It (like other Hazet tools and chests) is
*very* high quality and it's expensive, at around $450. I bought one 2
years ago and have never regretted it...until now.

I just got the latest ENCO tool catalogue and I was browsing through
until I came to page 261 and I gasped! There it is, a picture of *the*
Hazet Assistant, sans the Hazet name or logo, but looking identical
with a matching description for an unbelievable price of ... $64.75.
For those of you who know the Hazet Assistant you're drooling now and
you're calling ENCO (800-873-3626). But wait, I called ENCO and they
said it's a Taiwanese copy but exactly like the original. Has anyone

I am in the market again for street tires.  As we all do, I want everything.
I drive alot of highway miles, fast, and often (it's Michigan after all) in
bad weather (i.e., rain, snow, slush, ice).  Past wisdom of the net had me
thinking the Goodrich Comp T/A's were the best all-round tire for this type
of use.  I go to my local tire dealer who has, in the past, been
knowledgeable and honest, and he says the Michelin XGT H4 is a superior tire
in both wet and dry performance; cornering and braking.
Is he right??  Are these comparable tires? Should I be looking at others? I
went for price last time and will pass on Goodyears this time.

Yes, this is true.  Peter Farrell showed up at Sebring for the last Supercar 
race in a twin turbo and finished 3rd.  This series has really matured and I 
believe 22 cars started at Sebring.  IMSA has really suffered this year and 
attendance was down, but they are trying to address the problems and I think the
Supercars was very exciting racing with many manufactures represented.  Look for
more participation next year and hopefully improved performance from the 968 
teams in the Firehawk series.

Subject: RE: Street tires, again


Hi there,

I'm new to this mail list but I thought I'd add my two cents worth on tires for
street use.  I am an avid autocrosser and have been playing a bit with tires
for the last 4 years.  When I started, I was on a tight budget so I tried to
get a tire to cover all aspects of my driving.  The Bridgestone RE-71 standard
compound tire was my choice.  It was reasonable on the track and seemed decent
for the street.  But, it only lasted about 10,000 miles (< 1 year).  Must have
something to do with my racing.  

Anyway, the next year, I decided that I'd get another set of rims for track.  I
put some excellent Yokohama A008 RS tires on them (They are incredible and
their already out of date)!  For the street, a fellow autocrosser (one of the
top in our region) and performance tire shop owner recommended that I try the
Michelin XGT-V which is a V speed rated tire (for speeds < 150 mph).  He said
that it was very good (for a street tire) in wet and dry and that it would last
much longer.

He was correct.  I have found it to be a very good street tire.  It allows me
to have fun on the street while not going through a set of tires every year. 
So far, they have lasted 2 1/2 years.  The rears are getting close to
replacement time but the fronts still have at least 50% tread!  I have been
very happy with this set-up and would recommend it to others.

I have to admit though, I don't know if the XGT-H4 is a follow on to the XGT-V
or what.  You might ask your local tire dealer what the differences are.  Good
luck in your hunt and I hope this info is helpful.

 Dave,
 Greetings -its been a while.
I trust you've suffered thru my postings...     =:>
On your injectors,
I been reading the hotrod list and in the depths of PE (Performance
Engineering) John De Armond's rag has an article on testing and cleaning
injectors.  The article goes into detail of constructing an electronic
circuit for exercising an injector whilst gas/techron is cycled thru it 
at ~40psi pressure.  The article 'Fuel Injector Flow bench' is well written
and might appear in the early issues (my issue is a miniature sample 
I picked up at a PCA tech session last year).

There is also a BBS # for details and perhaps the article itself, that
number is: 501-985-0059 'Courts of Chaos BBS'.  John can be reached at:
jgd@dixie.com

I'm looking at the article right now...VERY simple circuit, less than 10
parts, couple of darlington's for switching the injector coil in and out
of circuit.  Uses a PC's parallel port to control the pulse width, rep 
rates, etc. this could be a great diagnostic and cleaning tool.

Xylene (carb cleaner) is very easy to get and works great on cleaning
gink out of fuel systems and other places, its possible your inlet
screens are filled.  These are in the injector body's fuel nipple
if memory serves, and can be exposed by removing the fuel line.
Hope this was of use.

Hi there,

I would like to comment on the Michelin XGT H4 (215/60HR15,
four season). I have them on my 944 ('86) since 
last year. They are excellent in the Canadian winter 
(which is the harshest you can possibly have). They 
are also excellent on wet. However, on dry, I can not 
take the tight turns I used to enjoy taking with my
old Yokohama Y 352s. 

Overall though, they are an excellent durable (treadwear 
is minimal up to now) COMPROMISE for the winter inclined
climates. Recently, I went from New York to Montreal at
90 miles/hour for most of the time under very heavy rain.
The tires felt very secure during deceleration, change 
of lanes etc... All other cars, including a 928 S4 
could not keep up with my speed. I don't feel I was 
taking a risk because of the feeling of control these 
tires gave.

I would like to hear from other 911 owners about their "impressions"
of popular performance tires.  I am mostly concerned about dry pavement
performance (non-autocross) since the rainy season is pretty short here
and I either don't drive 911's in the rain or I take it easy. 

I currently have RE71's on my wife's '89 911 and D40/M2's on my '88 turbo
look.  The wear and price is better on the D40's but the RE71's seem stickier.
I had P7's on an '84 cab and didn't like them much.  Also, is it worth it to go
for Z-rating?  I usually do but I rarely drive over 120 and mostly stay under
100.

What would are recommendations for a nice compromise between wear,
price and performance?  I would like to get 20-25k or better on a set.
Thanks.

My 83 911SC is rapidly closing in on the 100,000 mile mark. It has been very
little trouble in the 8 years I have owned it and I am looking for advice on
anything special I should have my mechanic look at when I get it serviced.
The tensioners have already been done, clutch & brakes are fine.

My votes, for the air-cooled faction:

911, et al.:  Yoko AVS Intermediates. Good enough for track and autox, but
	mainly a street tire. Expect to buy new rears every year, new
	fronts every 3. I'm on my 4th set of rears, second set of fronts.
	Typically on 12-15K street miles, a couple of autox, and one track
	day per year. I usually run the second set of wheels on the autox
	and track days, but sometimes, I get lazy.... Doesn't hurt my times
	too much, either...

914:	Yoko AVS U+4. Slightly rounder shoulders seem to work a bit
	better. Have also used Pirelli P600 with some pleasure, P44s	
	and P6s with some distaste.

356:	CN36 (Yeah, right...) Actually, Yoko 509s work well, as do
	Comp T/As in 185/65x15

I hear that Michelien and Dunlop are great on WaterPumpers. I have no
opinion on that. Well, you *know* what I mean... 8{P

Oh, all recomendations take into account driving hard and fast in the
rain. Frequently. This is Houston, you know...

It does not work if it is not in NTSC format, we Europeans mostly have
PAL. I'd guess Porsche is making this tape in NTSC too.

Some of the more modern VCR's *do* have switching possibillities between

Thanks, Scott. I couldn't remember the name of mine and it 
sounded the same from the description posted. Mine had a key
with approx. 6 uniquely spaced pins which fitted into the hemi-
sperical piece that stayed on the stud. A hex cap then screwed
onto the stud so that the lock was looked identical to the other

Correct me if I am wrong but arn't we talking about the 2nd generation
RX7 Turbos. I didn't think the 3rd generation RX7's were even allowed
to compete in any Firehawk races. In the On Track magazine I have always
seen Farrell competing with a RX7 T in the A class and not the SSGT class.
I know Farrell competes on occasion with a third generation RX7 in the

street/competition.  Sparco makes some real nice seats for dual

I personally am going to put A Butler aluminum seat($240) in my race car
to replace the cobra clubman.  The Butler is comfortable and really

We in the U.S. have NTSC (Never The Same Color - oops, I mean National

The Hazet Assistant is a beautiful light-blue colored folding toolbox

collapses down on itself into a very small package. The top shelf also
doubles as a temporary work surface in the upright position and the
numerous small compartments in the thing can hold most of your
frequently used hand tools. It (like other Hazet tools and chests) is
*very* high quality and it's expensive, at around $450. I bought one 2
years ago and have never regretted it...until now.

I just got the latest ENCO tool catalogue and I was browsing through

with a matching description for an unbelievable price of ... $64.75.
For those of you who know the Hazet Assistant you're drooling now and

I am in the market again for street tires.  As we all do, I want everything.
I drive alot of highway miles, fast, and often (it's Michigan after all) in
bad weather (i.e., rain, snow, slush, ice).  Past wisdom of the net had me
thinking the Goodrich Comp T/A's were the best all-round tire for this type
of use.  I go to my local tire dealer who has, in the past, been
knowledgeable and honest, and he says the Michelin XGT H4 is a superior tire
in both wet and dry performance; cornering and braking.
Is he right??  Are these comparable tires? Should I be looking at others? I
went for price last time and will pass on Goodyears this time.

Yes, this is true.  Peter Farrell showed up at Sebring for the last Supercar 
race in a twin turbo and finished 3rd.  This series has really matured and I 
believe 22 cars started at Sebring.  IMSA has really suffered this year and 
attendance was down, but they are trying to address the problems and I think the
Supercars was very exciting racing with many manufactures represented.  Look for
more participation next year and hopefully improved performance from the 968 
teams in the Firehawk series.

Subject: RE: Street tires, again


Hi there,

I'm new to this mail list but I thought I'd add my two cents worth on tires for
street use.  I am an avid autocrosser and have been playing a bit with tires
for the last 4 years.  When I started, I was on a tight budget so I tried to
get a tire to cover all aspects of my driving.  The Bridgestone RE-71 standard
compound tire was my choice.  It was reasonable on the track and seemed decent
for the street.  But, it only lasted about 10,000 miles (< 1 year).  Must have
something to do with my racing.  

Anyway, the next year, I decided that I'd get another set of rims for track.  I
put some excellent Yokohama A008 RS tires on them (They are incredible and
their already out of date)!  For the street, a fellow autocrosser (one of the
top in our region) and performance tire shop owner recommended that I try the
Michelin XGT-V which is a V speed rated tire (for speeds < 150 mph).  He said
that it was very good (for a street tire) in wet and dry and that it would last
much longer.

He was correct.  I have found it to be a very good street tire.  It allows me
to have fun on the street while not going through a set of tires every year. 
So far, they have lasted 2 1/2 years.  The rears are getting close to
replacement time but the fronts still have at least 50% tread!  I have been
very happy with this set-up and would recommend it to others.

I have to admit though, I don't know if the XGT-H4 is a follow on to the XGT-V
or what.  You might ask your local tire dealer what the differences are.  Good
luck in your hunt and I hope this info is helpful.

and might appear in the early issues (my issue is a miniature sample 
I picked up at a PCA tech session last year).

There is also a BBS # for details and perhaps the article itself, that
number is: 501-985-0059 'Courts of Chaos BBS'.  John can be reached at:
jgd@dixie.com

I'm looking at the article right now...VERY simple circuit, less than 10
parts, couple of darlington's for switching the injector coil in and out
of circuit.  Uses a PC's parallel port to control the pulse width, rep 
rates, etc. this could be a great diagnostic and cleaning tool.

Xylene (carb cleaner) is very easy to get and works great on cleaning
gink out of fuel systems and other places, its possible your inlet
screens are filled.  These are in the injector body's fuel nipple
if memory serves, and can be exposed by removing the fuel line.
Hope this was of use.

Hi there,

I would like to comment on the Michelin XGT H4 (215/60HR15,
four season). I have them on my 944 ('86) since 
last year. They are excellent in the Canadian winter 
(which is the harshest you can possibly have). They 
are also excellent on wet. However, on dry, I can not 
take the tight turns I used to enjoy taking with my
old Yokohama Y 352s. 

Overall though, they are an excellent durable (treadwear 
is minimal up to now) COMPROMISE for the winter inclined
climates. Recently, I went from New York to Montreal at
90 miles/hour for most of the time under very heavy rain.
The tires felt very secure during deceleration, change 
of lanes etc... All other cars, including a 928 S4 
could not keep up with my speed. I don't feel I was 
taking a risk because of the feeling of control these 
tires gave. 

Regards, Andre Rotchel,

I would like to hear from other 911 owners about their "impressions"
of popular performance tires.  I am mostly concerned about dry pavement
performance (non-autocross) since the rainy season is pretty short here
and I either don't drive 911's in the rain or I take it easy. 

I currently have RE71's on my wife's '89 911 and D40/M2's on my '88 turbo
look.  The wear and price is better on the D40's but the RE71's seem stickier.
I had P7's on an '84 cab and didn't like them much.  Also, is it worth it to go
for Z-rating?  I usually do but I rarely drive over 120 and mostly stay under
100.

What would are recommendations for a nice compromise between wear,
price and performance?  I would like to get 20-25k or better on a set.
Thanks.

My votes, for the air-cooled faction:

911, et al.:  Yoko AVS Intermediates. Good enough for track and autox, but
	mainly a street tire. Expect to buy new rears every year, new
	fronts every 3. I'm on my 4th set of rears, second set of fronts.
	Typically on 12-15K street miles, a couple of autox, and one track
	day per year. I usually run the second set of wheels on the autox
	and track days, but sometimes, I get lazy.... Doesn't hurt my times
	too much, either...

914:	Yoko AVS U+4. Slightly rounder shoulders seem to work a bit
	better. Have also used Pirelli P600 with some pleasure, P44s	
	and P6s with some distaste.

356:	CN36 (Yeah, right...) Actually, Yoko 509s work well, as do
	Comp T/As in 185/65x15

I hear that Michelien and Dunlop are great on WaterPumpers. I have no
opinion on that. Well, you *know* what I mean... 8{P

I had Yokohama A008-R TU's on my 911 for 4 years (25,000 mi.)
of non-track use. They were excellent tires in wet or dry 
conditions - never hydroplaned even when they looked like slicks.
Never tried them in snow, but they have so little tread, I don't
imagine they would work.

Currently using RE-71's and IMHO they're not in the same class.
I've noticed that they "chirp and complain" under heavy braking
and I've drifted around some backroad turns that didn't even seem
fast with the A008's. They do *look* a lot better though, I don't
have people telling me my tires are bald all the time. And I'm
sure the RE-71's must be better in the wet, although they seem 
the same.

Hmmm . . .  If they don't corner as well as Y352's, I'd be

Y352's for my Honda, and they were very slippery.  How-

        Reply to:   RE>Hazet Assistant Toolbox
I stopped by Enco to look at their Hazet Toolcart knockoff ($64.75).  I had a
bit
of a handicap since I'd never seen the German Hazet (~$450) but John Colasante
provided me with a very good detailed description.

FYI, the toolcart is designed as a 13"X26" tub on wheels with two tower tubes
to allow two trays (and a third flat work surface) to be lifted and fixed into
positions for holding small tools.  When expanded it stands almost 3' tall.
It is constructed of steel and weighs 30lbs.

This asian knockoff seemed to me to be priced about right.  Functionally, it
appears to be much like the German version described, except that the two
towers supports are bolted in place and not telescopic so there's no way the
unit can be folded up for storing in trunk.  They seem a little wobbily too.
Nothing about it suggested very high quality, although I couldn't see any fatal
flaws.  The tub finish did not look scratch resistant but hey, it's a toolcart.
The steel towers and trays were not flimsy gauge, but neither did they seem
strong enough to stand on for instance (why you would stand on it is not the
point).  The rubber locking wheels seemed of average quality.  The tray
dividers were definitely cheap and easily bendable.

I am having trouble understanding what could turn this into a $450 cart
(but then I have trouble with $70 911 rearview mirrors, $4,000 targa tops,
$800 cab boots, etc.).  My guess is that the German unit is far superior but
for those on a budget, or those who wonder whether the design is useful,
take a chance and risk little.

Subject: RE: Street tires, again

My 87 911 originally came with D40's.  When they wore out at about
18K miles I put on XGTV's.  At 33K miles they still have plenty of
tread.  I have used them on the track, but got tired of having to
rebalance tires after each event so my second set of wheels/tires
are RE71's.


I hate the RE71's and will replace them just as soon as they wear out.
They are very noisy when pushed and I have swapped ends with no warning
a couple of times, even with lower tire pressures.  This never happend
with the D40's or XGT's.

For a street tire, I think one of the best features of the XGTV is
its softer sidewall.  The ride over  the road irregularities is
much smoother than with the other 2 tires.  When I put the RE71's on
to drive to the track, I feel every stone and expansion joint.  Personally,
I find this very annoying. 

So, I think the XGTV is a great street tire...good wear, excellent
ride and good grip, braking and turning, wet and dry.

Never Drove in the snow...in New England I parked the car for the winter,
in California, I take my 4Runner up to the mountains.

Now, If I could decide on a good track tire without moving out of the
box stock class....

black, what is the color of the hatch (exterior) at the hinge point?  This
is the piece that attaches to the roof, and holds the rear hatch glass.

Also, while you're checking, make sure that the pins holding the hatch
to the car are in place......amazing what time and rough roads do to

people suggest that they have a very high wear rate, but mine have
over 6000 miles and are less than half worn. I think that on
a very powerful 911 (mine is a 3.2 Carrera) they would get
scrubbed off much faster, but for regular use they are fine IMHO.

I did take the car to Silverstone recently, and they held up very well.
At the end of each session I checked them out and was amazed a how
sticky the rubber gets at track temperatures.

My car does the exact same thing yours does with the cruise control. Can you

Contrary to other's experiences, I've had very good luck with RE-71s on
my '93 MX-6.  I drive 70 miles/day on an interstate consisting of numerous
surface types (concrete with 1" expansion joints, smooth asphalt, and patched
asphalt) and have been very happy with them (they still have tread after
28K miles).  


I've autocrossed on them several times and, while being a little
noisy, they gripped quite well and seem to handle rain with no problem.
YMMV

Too bad there isn't a way to test-drive tires....legally

As someone correctly pointed out, my comment about the
RE-71's not being as "sticky" as A008-R TU's (basically
track tires) wasn't entirely fair. I'm basically very
happy with the Bridgstones, just more cautious about
car control. They're maybe even a little safer for the
street once you get used to them, because unlike the 
Yokahamas, they telegraph the limits to you well before 
you get there. $$$

If you mean the trim strip that runs around the upper edge of the hatch 
glass, it's always been black on 944s.  Sometimes the paint fades and 
you get silver (natural) color showing through.

Among major brand (Yokohama, BFG, Bridgestone, Michelin, Dunlop)

and the Dunlop D4OM (not D40/M2).  In both cases, the manufacturers
have introduced new designs: the Goodyear GS-C and the Dunlop D40/M2.  
If someone gave me a new set of RE71's for my car, I would certainly use

Okay, I'll put in my $.02 too.

I've got just under 30k miles on a set of yoko a008's (that's plural,
not model).

They are great dry.  They are also the first tire I have ever had
truely hydroplane.  I don't mean they got a little vague, they felt
like a boat rudder, only more squishy.

I have a second set of wheels for competition, so these only see 
street use, which is largely highway.  I'll push them a little 
but it's kind of rare: throttle steer the occasional on ramp, pull 
away from the occasional motorcycle on skyline, but mostly I drive
fast and loose off the highway.

Next question is:

Anyone got a suggestion for a high mileage tire?  I got a good deal 
on the yoko's but don't really feel like spending $800 to replace 
them.

I've asked this before, but there seems to be some new blood on 
the list lately, perhaps with some new suggestions.

I'm looking for lower cost/mile.  Current favorite is a Falken.
Particularly since I just had a student at the zone auto-x
school drive **very** well on a set.  These had a treadwear
rating of 220 (160 on the a008).

Comments?

Suggestions?

Fellow porschephiles,
 A friend and colleague has a '62 356B that I helped convert from a lawn orname
nt to a car that at least runs.   After sharing the car for a year and much enc
ouragement from me, he is finally willing to sell it to me.  Our problem is tha
t we don't know a fair value for the car.  I'd prefer a local expert, but I'm n
ot sure how to look for one we can both trust.  A phone quote from the most exp
ert local said $5-6k, but after looking at Excellence ads and 1993 Standard Gui
de to Cars and Prices, I think that is too high.  The car needs a lot of help.
It has a '66 VW engine; 2nd gear is missing (original transmission); it has 270
K miles; lots of rust - floorpans, rocker panels (but still sturdy), driver doo
r post, rear seat, battery pan bottom and     drivers side, bumper attachments,
 bars connecting chasis to rear axle (need to be fabricated).  An estimate to r
epair the undercarriage rust was $3k last spring.  The interior upholstery all
needs to be replaced due to leaks (mildew and rust).  The exterior looks like a
'62- original paint; a minor repair was made to the rear end and painted almost
 to match, minor rust spots, a bad hood hinge that made a small crease in the h
ood, minor dings from being a dailey driver, but it looks good especially from
a modest distance.  After all, it *IS* a Porsche.
   Any suggestions you have to help us arrive at a fair value will be greatly a
ppreciated.  To save bandwidth, my email is opsin@nervm.nerdc.ufl.edu in Gaines
ville, FL.  If you want to talk, email me and I'll send you my home 800 number.
  Thanks in advance for your help (Gosh I like the net!)

Porsche Peers, even my '81 928 had an air conditioned glovebox!  All that
"A/C" consisted of was an additional vent opening that happened to be in
the glovebox.  No high tech required, just room behind the dash to route
the air.  And this was factory stock, not a hatchet job.

Sometimes, low tech masquerades as high tech.  Frequently with the aid of
elegant engineering of a simple concept.

The reason for the problems with FUCHS replicas is that forged metal si
SO much stronger than cast (pressure or not).  When companies made the
fuchs replicas they simply copies the fuchs design without reinforcing
for lower strength material.

The wheels that are pressure cast replicas of other pressure cast wheels
are generally OK because they were engineered with that material in mind
and are appropriately reinforced.

Imagine taking a '60s steel wheel from a US passenger car, only when you
made it you just took a cast of the steel wheel and poured in some moten
Aluminum.  You could prob. bend it by stepping on the rim.  The problem
with the copying of fuchs is just that.

Porsche has only ever made 3 popular forged wheel styles - Fuchs, 928
flat style wheels, and the 951S forged wheels.

If you are still not convinced that this is the case compare a 944 turbo
cup (magnesium) wheel to a 1987 phone dial of the same width (8"). If you do so
you'll notice that the 8" wheel actually LOOKS like a 7" wheel from the
outside because the material in the webbing is about 3/8" thicker and
the whole center sticks out that much farther.  We noticed this when we
put on wheel fans. The front 8" magnesium wheel really doesn't accept a
fan since the center sticks out farther than the rim.  The rear 9" mag
wheel is nearly identical to the 951 (87) 8" wheel and accepts the same
wheel fan.

Subject: RE71....and the RE71R's

Well, couldn't resist commenting on the RE's....

Well, there are 2 types- the RE71 is a street tire that (like Drew mentioned)
is a very good tire, especially in the wet.  Good wear, with excellent
feedback at the limit (they are not twitchy at all).

NOW FOR THE GOOD NEWS: The 'other type' is...

The RE71R ('R' stands for race, i guess...) is an EXCELLENT HIGH PERFORMANCE
TIRE.  PERIOD!!! I used to run these tires and the have excellent stick &
wear great!!!  As for how they compare to YOKO's (please understand that
I am a YOKOHAMA contract driver [no big deal...I get free tires for my
AX car ((was a 911, now a BMW-bummer here...))] so I will tell the
trueth about these tires..), the RE71R's are 1-2 seconds faster at Sears
Point (ITS road racing on a Porsche 944) than the YOKO RS's.  This is actual
data for a company that sets up 944/911's (Project Racing Services, who's
owner MARK (forgot last mane) @ 707-996-7719 will talk to you about all
the testing they do...).  He has said that these tires are great and wear
very well, with little effect of heat cycling (they are using Goodyear
GS-CS's now for dry, because they are about .5 seconds faster, per lap,
than the RE71R's, but are only good for ***** 2 ****** heat cycles!!!, then
they go away BIG TIME (which is VERY $$$$$$) ).

ALSO, remeber that there are **2** tread patterns with the RE71R's:
there is a regular thread block pattern and a 'slick' pattern (can't
for the life of me remember the designation's.. Bill Buetow could tell
us all about the Bridgestones...he used to be a contract driver for
them for SCCA AX'ing...).  The open tread is a great RAIN (hence 'street'
tire) and the 'slick' pattern (even more of a slick as it wears or is shaved
down to 3/32's) is a great dry, track tire.


Please understand they are NOT AX tires, like the YOKO RSII's, so you will
not get the quick heat up & stick like the II's, but they are very easy to
drive and are a great compromise!!


Personally, I realy like these tires and the are fantastic in the RAIN!!

Here are my humble opinions on tires:

                          [the new AX compound should wear much better

Regarding the pressure cast Fachs (fake Fuchs, pronounce at own risk...),
If the dimensions are the same as a Fuchs wheel, I'd avoid them.

No casting is as strong as a forging, so unless the wheel is thicker,
it will be weaker.

It also depends on the applicaiton.  They might be okay for daily 
driving, but not for track use.

To date, I've found no solution (not that I've looked too hard).  I am just
more careful to not turn on the heat/defrost until the car is good and warmed
up and the water has already evaporated.  This makes for a cold ride to work
since the above described evaporation does not occur over the 5 short miles I

Well this reminds me of when I owned a 72 VW Beetle (The only motor car with
a more uncontrollable heating systems than a 911). One day I was out driving
and experinced extraordinary levels of precipitation, ie torrential summer
thunderstorm and clounburst with flooding everywhere. I had to negotiate
a number of floods 4-6 inches deep at least. Somehow lots and lots of water
found its way into the heater boxes, and because my VW heating was
unswitchoffable, very large jets of steam started to squirt from all the
heater vents in the sills and the ones under the windscreen. The whole car
was full of steam like a sauna when you throw loads of water on the rocks.
Everything was steamed up, including my glasses.

The situation was complicated because the window winders did not work, so
I had to drive through the floods with the door open leaning out to see where
I was going. 

A fun car none the less.

Well, really four.  That "Fuchs" in your list should include both the
traditional 911 Fuchs 5-spoke, as well as the 914's optional Fuchs 4-spoke
(commonly known as the "914 2.0L wheel").

Just picking nits ... two more days before the 914 takes the trip to

Have any of you seen the articles on the 993 in Automobile and
Car & Driver? The car looks great to me (I'm starting a new savings
account). I especially like how the whole look has been smoothed
over without losing the 911 look. The hood line has been raised
while the fenders have been lowered giving the front end a more
aggressive look. The 993 in Car & Driver is fly yellow and really
looks impressive. The silver 993 in Automobile looks a little more
subdued.

The driving impressions suggest the new suspension has finally
solved the end swapping characteristic without sacrificing the
throttle-steering abilities of the car.

What do you'all think?

Subject: Re: 356b mods what do you think

The "big bore" kit is a new set of pistons and cylinders from NPR
(Nippon Piston Ring) and is, as of August, NO LONGER AVAILABLE. Any
kits you find have "appreciated" significantly since then, and many
people (including Tweeks) advertise them but can't deliver. Near as I
can tell, Harry Pellow bought up most of the stock (damn it -- I hate
doing business with Harry!).

Otherwise, it's the right thing to do.

Weber carbs are also good to do -- but buy them from PMO (Porsche Mail
Order -- ads in the usual Porsche mags) instead of anyone else. You'll
save several hundred dollars.

The stock carbs, even Solexes, have the problem of many parts not being
available. NLA in Nevada has a Solex rebuild service that puts your carb 
back to just about perfect condition for $200 each. Got mine back a week
or so ago, and they *look* GREAT. Haven't put them on an engine yet, though.
But for the Weber, I can reach into my race gear and re-jet or re-venturi
as needed to get it to work. And I can get these parts all day long. Solex
parts, yeah, right. You can make some of them, you can adapt some Weber
parts, but youcan't buy lots of them any longer...

Subject: Re: 356b mods

Wow! A 356 question; I finally get to say something on the net.

I, like many others, have used the NPR "big bore" 1720 cc pistons and
cylinders on a 356.  There is, of course, no boring out of the engine:
the new pistons and cylinders just replace the originals and you use
the old heads (assuming they are in good shape, which is often an
unjustified assumption).  The main reason for doing this is not really
the "big bore" part, but rather the "low price" compared to Porsche
replacement parts.  I am not familiar with the Tweeks kit, I just
bought the NPR set at a local supplier; nothing else is needed except
some gaskets.

BUT, those gaskets can be very critical, because some, the copper rings
used between the block and the cylinders, determine the compression
ratio, and in some cases, lack of same will cause pistons to make
intimate contact with head & valves, which is bad news.  The good news
is that you can choose the spacers to get pretty much whatever
compression ratio you want.  You need to know the displacement of your
heads--especially if they have been flycut--and then make some
calculations, pick spacers, assemble, and CHECK BY MEASUREMENT before
firing up.  The best guide for this is the Maestro's books, worth every
$ in both guidance and entertainment.

By the way, don't wait too long to get the NPR set; word has it (see
the Maestro's recent column in the 356 Registry) that NPR is ceasing
production of this item, so it will be back to the expensive Porsche
part.  The Maestro is stocking up, and sells BALANCED sets, which is
a nice advantage.

Also, don't expect this to be a terrificly "hot setup". I guess some
performance improvement is likely, depending on how you set up the
compression ratio, and if you get the cam reground, but it is not going
to be astounding; perhaps not even noticible to the casual observer.
For a street car, and with today's gas, it is probably not wise to go
above a compression ratio of 9.1, which if I remember correctly, is
more than a 356 C normal engine, less than a SC engine, but about the
same as 912s.  Others on the net may have different experience.

If you are doing all this, it is a good time to magnaflux/regrind the
cam, magnaflux & balance the rods, new rod bearings, of course.  And on
no account use the old rod bolts/nuts, only new.  But then, you probably
know all that; if not, consult THE BOOK.

Can't help you regarding Webers.  Once I learned how to rebuild,
adjust, and balance the Zeniths, I had too much invested to switch!

Good luck,  Jim Young, young@rice.edu, Houston, TX.

*********************************************************************

Ken,

You didn't list symptoms in the original post.

I think I know what's wrong (not that I know the symptoms).

There is a hose/duct between the heat exchanger and the ducting comming 
from the fan in the engine compartment.  When this hose tears, you 
get water/condensation into the heat exchanger/flapper box area. 
Turning on the heat generally gets this water into the heat exchanger
and it turns to vapor and steams your windows (you will never guess
how I know this...).

Inspect (and then replace) the hoses that connect to the heat exchangers.

One each side under the car near the back.

Automotion has some nice durable rubber/metal ones.  They look like they
will last, and only make the car smell like rubber for a few weeks.

Bob, I just ran into a similar problem with my '84 Carrera. I do not know if 
your car works the same way. Hope this helps.

I noticed that when I pulled on the red levers that are next to the hand brake
only the passanger side was activated by the pass. lever. The driver's lever
produced no output of air (the fan would not turn on). I believe that in my
car I have separate L/R blowers. Don't know about yours...

I proceded to look at the wiring diagrams. Then I remember that when I installed
a Shortschifter, there were a couple of cables comming out of the heat levers
by the hand brake. I was able to trace the problem to this switch. I did not
even had to change it. I used a little sandpaper, some contact cleaner and a
little coaxing with a screw driver. I actually pushed in the contacts a bit. 
This was just enough to make it work.

Oh, BTW, I used an ohmeter to check the operation of the switch. And make sure
that the lower,red lever in the dash is all the way to the right. This shoot all
heated air to the windshield.

You might want to check this out in your car. I hope they work the same way.

Good Luck!

It must be the REAL sports car syndrome...my '84 VW Scirocco has it too.
Maybe I ought to replace it with a 944 (nah!).  The steps listed below
have mitigated - but not necessarily eliminated - the steam problem for me:


* Check to see if your heat box's drain is plugged up (water can't escape)
* Run heat the day before to try to keep the system as dry as possible
* See if the slant the car is parked on results in pooling that can't escape
* Wait for the heat to come up a little bit before trying to apply heat(steam).
* Run AC to keep the window defogged (Brr!)
* Open the windows and go to full blast with the steamy stuff.

These are pretty much in order of preference, and they've helped on my
VW.  I don't know the 911 heating system to determine how relevant some
of these may be.  I'm going to try Bob's suggestion of "warm the air and
then move to defrost" next time its nasty here in NJ such that I have to
take the VW.

Minh, here's what I've done:

1. Open trunk and peel back rug half way. There are two button snaps by the
firewall? (Dashboard)

2. Using a 10mm wrench, remove 4 nuts that hold a curved cardboard cover right
in front of dash. You will see heater cables and blower. Right in front of the
driver, there is a little silver box, about 1.5 x 5 x 8 inches. It has a 
multiple connector that attaches to its bottom.

3. Using a screw driver, remove it. I think it uses 2 screws. Disconnect it
from the connector and you are ready to clean/re-assembly. No need to open it,
since "there are no user serviceable parts".

4. If this does not work, you might have a vacuum leak in your servo motor.
This can be tested with a vacuum pump e.g. Mighty-Vac.

Hope this helps...

Subject: Forged/Cast/Repro Wheels

My 2 Cents worth to the net,

Having gone full circle on wheels on my '86 951, I'll let
you benefit from my mistakes/experiences.

Fortunately, an '86 951 will accept 930 wheels, unlike later
951's, so if I want forged wheels, I have the choice of:

Fuchs: 7x16, 8x16, 9x16

BBS RS: 7,7.5,8,8.5,9,9.5x16,x17
(these are 3-piece w/forged centers, and spun alum. rim halves)

BBS also makes the RG, a single-piece forged wheel, but not avail.
in US, only Europe and Japan

OZ and Gotti/Etoile also make 3-piece wheels with forged centers
and spun aluminum rims.

Robert Wood and BBS Motorsport (Atlanta) both agree that forged
is the best for STREET.  The unbeatable strength can handle 
curbs, potholes, speedbumps, etc. without catastrophic failure.
They may still bend, but will not shatter.

Cost is still a premium for any make of forged wheel.

BBS Motorsport makes race wheels for all applications, including
962's, etc. which are not streetable because they are NOT STRONG
ENOUGH.  They have magnesium centers and thinner aluminum rims.
They are designed for light weight and take advantage of generally
more friendly conditions found on road race tracks.

As for cast repro's, they're as good as cast originals of equal
quality.  My brother-in-law has a set of shattered original
cookie cutter's to prove it.

Re: The 993

A friend of mine recently traveled to Germany and brought back an
official factory brochure for the 993.  The bodywork looks great,
as does the interior. The door panels and ends of the dash have
been resculped to flow together smoothly.  The dash gauges have
the familiar 911 organization, with a new improved clock (complete
with high-speed advance controlled by a button on the dash).  I
don't recall what the seats look like.  Steering wheel is one of
the now-generic things with four spokes and an airbag in the
middle.

The trick bits of note in this particular book are the headlights,
which seem to combine a hyperellipsoidal (sp?) beam and a more
traditional sealed (halogen) beam in the same lens.  It isn't
clear which is the main beam and which focuses the brights.  The
rear suspension is carried in a cast aluminum ()-shaped gizmo, the
castings having clearly-visible reinforcing webbing; dampers are
coil-overs I believe; location by 4 or 5 links (I don't recall
they looked like A-arms).

The rear view is sweet, the front view very 968-ish but much more
squat, aformentioned headlights raked back somewhat.  The
windshield and roof are familiar 911.  My friend considers the
C-pillar/roof-into-rear fenders-wheel well the one awkward piece
of styling.  Cup-like wheels and the usual mondo brakes complete
the side view.

Twin coolers are located behind a largish chin duct - one for A/C,
one for oil.  Targa is gone - coupe and cabrio only.  Pricing in
DM was equivalent to about US$70000.

I'm like to see one (hopefully up close and stationary) before
passing judgement.  My friend tells me that there are many more
oddly-colored cars driving about in Germany than here (where it
seems 99% of mondern cars are black, white, or arrest-me red),
with lots of pastels and multi-hued metallics.

Cheers,
Tim

Subject: reproduction alloys

Around 1976 an auto parts saleman showed me the 5 spoke center 
that had snapped out of an Italian made "fake Fuchs".  

He said it was from his 912 and happened under hard cornering.  

According to him, it was not caused by hitting a curb, and was not caused by
a tire failure, since the rim with tubed tire was recovered still inflated.

The car was totaled in the wreck.  

He was one "unhappy camper", since the wheel distributor denied any liability.

I have NEVER heard similar stories about the USA made reproduction wheels,
they may be fine.

I had the option to buy reproductions or used forged and I opted for used.

If you decide to buy used:

  911 forged alloy wheels are commonly available in the 15 X 6 size.  
  $500 +/- $100 will get you a usable set of 4.

  Some of the 15 X 6 wheels take the 3-prong center cap, some take the ring 
  center cap.  Not all of mine are the same, so I have both types of caps.

  There may be other offset/appearance differences in factory 15 X 6 wheels.
  Robert Wood in LA should be a good source of information.

  After visually inspecting the wheel, if memory serves, there are three
  measurements to make: radial runout, axial runout and wear of the radius 
  of the rim where it contacts the tire.  

  So the factory has found that an alloy wheel can wear out.

  The spec's are in the 72+ 911 factory shop manual and in some of the 
  later spec books.  

  It will be impossible to measure the wheel with a tire mounted.

  The contact radius spec is checked with a radius gauge, the other two 
  with a dial indicator.

My Karmen Ghia was notorious for having to have wipers on the inside as well

Is the best way to defog with fresh, non-heated air? Or, as was suggested to

with interior heater vents closed and all hot air forced to the windscreen?

I know us Californians don't deal with the wet stuff much, but we can be inun-

I have the same problem although the defrosting works on the passenger side
but no on my side. I haven't looked into it because I thought it had to do with 
rusty heating chambers.

What I noticed though was that the heater fan didn't work. When taking the
motor apart the cause was traced to the coals which where worn out. Easy to
fix, huh? Oh, no! Coals are (very suprisingly) not spares. Porsche could
only offer a new motor for a lot of bucks!

The sollution was to get coals for a Volvo (I think) generator and to
modify the coal holders slightly. Did cost me approximately 2$!

I went to the Motor Show at Earls court for the UK launch of the 993.
I had a good look at the 993 on the Porsche stand, sat in it, and
wanted one. Sadly I lack 53400 GBP so was not able to place and
order.  I liked the feel of the new six ratio gearbox, and I think
that the new smoothed look is classic 911. I want one.

Of course, over the years Fuchs has made a wide variety of forged wheels
for Porsche, beginning with the 4 1/2 x 15 wheels for the early 911S,
but the 4 bolt 914 Fuchs wheels were enough different than the rest that
perhaps they deserve special mention. While on that subject, those
of you who use the 914 Fuchs wheels on the track should be aware that
they can crack. I cracked 2 of them over the course of a few hundred
PCA track events, as well as significant street driving. Yes, they
were factory wheels, not repro's. No, I didn't slide them into a curb
or some such. They crack between the openings, perhaps 2 inches toward
the center from the rim. In both cases the wheel stayed intact.
I wouldn't do anything drastic, just look at them carefully after each
event.

Also, on the more general topic of "fake" cast Fuchs look-alike wheels,
most (all?) regions of the PCA in the Northeast will not allow these
wheels to run at PCA track events.

Subject: 911 Oil Tank Questions

Hello!

I've got a few questions about some oil tank work and I could use the benefit
of the net's experiences...

My oil level sending unit went out on my '75 911S.  Symptom:  The gauge 
alternated between *very full* and *very empty* at idle and w/ a warm motor.
After I assured myself that the motor was not in the process of self-destructing
I unhooked the sending unit hot wire, taped it off and secured it, and continued
my trip (I was many miles from home, at the Grand Canyon - excellent road trip
area if you get the chance!)

To replace it, I cleaned the area well, took out the old, put in the new, fixed
an *iffy* wiring harness connection, and it all worked well.  This was several
months ago.  Recently I noticed that the '75 sending unit is NLA and what I
actually installed was an '81-'89 unit (page 65 of the *Performance Products*
catalog).  It also mentions that a new dipstick is required.  This makes sense
to me:  I've checked the oil a few times and heard/felt a soft *click* as I
withdrew the stick - no doubt the dipstick is interfering with the sending
unit float.

Here are my questions:

1.  What's the geometry like in the tank?  Am I poking a hole in the float?

2.  Can I just shorten my old dipstick?  How much?


On a related subject...  I've noticed that the tank is showing a little copper.
Since the car has just entered storage for the winter [:-(] I'll be changing 
the oil REAL SOON NOW and intend to remove the tank and refinish it while it's 
empty.  I'd like to hear some stories/get some advice on this topic.  

Specifically,

1.  How do you prep the tank properly?  I know the copper coating is thin so
sandpaper is a no-no but how do you get it all cleaned up and ready?

2.  What's a good chip resistant paint for this application?  I have access to
a good paint gun so that's an option, but is there an *out of the can* solution?

3.  Any experience with the Wurth underbody spray? (on page 96 of the 
*Performance* catalog, for instance)  Is this what I should use?  What's the
best source for one or two cans of the stuff?


Thanks for your thoughts on this subject!!

Greetings gang,
Just a quick question;

On late model 914's (and mid-seventies 911's i suspect) the bumpers are
mounted to the body using 'bumper shocks'.  These are expensive ($160 ea.)
to replace.

My question is; if the shock isnt damaged is it necessary to replace it
if it has been pushed in?  (like from push starting with another car)

Is there a way to retract the shock mechanism to its original position?

Thanx,
A quick response would save me from ordering one up from Stoddard today.
And NO, im not the numbnuts that pushed this car with another.

Hello!

Here's what happened to me...

WHAM!! from behind!  I thought the car was totaled...  But, then I got out,
looked, and realized that I'd been hit square on the right side ruuber
absorber of my 911.  A few paint scrapes and a pushed in back bumper.  The
body shop that did the work (Bavarian Coach Werks, south of Dayton, OH) said
that the bumper shock didn't need replaced because it was only pushed in a
little and wasn't leaking oil.  It was an insurance job (thank goodness!) so
they could have replaced it with no hassle but said it didn't need to be done.
They just pulled it out about 3/8" or so and put it back on.  No sweat.

Good luck!

I read in an old body shop book (testbook) from the early 80's how 
they used to actually take these things apart and repair them.  Of 
course this was on old detroit steel not porsches.  

Anyway you should be able to basically pull the sukers out again. 
They are basically gas charged shocks but the thing is, they never 
move.  So, when they are finally eventually pushed in they somtimes 
stick.  I had this happen to me on a superbeetle and what i did was 
stick bar between the body and the bumper and just give it a little 
coax and it popped out on its own.  

I knwo a 914 has no space between the body and the bumper but if 
you can figure out a way to get a grip on it just yank it out

I hate sayin' stuff like this cuz i know theres just somone out there 
whose gonna disagree....

Subject: Fake Fuchs....

I had a set of fake (replica) Fuchs made by American.  They were
heavier than the forged originals, but the cost was right ($200/4)!

Well, I was skeptical about their strength until I wrecked my 911 into a
rock wall at well !! over the national speed limit (my poor judgement here
but the cars was handling sooooo great...).
Anyway, the front replica took a BIG hit (I mean really big) and , to my
surprise, was NOT BENT!!! The  outer lip broke off, due to it being
cast, but the wheel was STRAIGHT & was repaired (I DID NOT & WILL NOT EVER
RECOMMEND THIS ON A CAST WHEEL- the 'new' owner of my old car was a REAL
tight *ss and didn't want to fork up the 125 clams for a new one....he
is very stupid & I told him that to his face, but he bought the car...).

The rear wheel took a slightly slower hit, since the car rotated around
after hitting the mountain, and was only scratched...not even bent!

A WORD OF CAUTION HERE  (engineer geek speaking):  THese cast replicas
will NOT BENT-THEY FAIL (BREAK) UNDER EXCESSIVE LOAD!! The factory forged
factory wheel, under the same loading, will bend and stay together...

Choose your posion, I would only recommend them for Highway use only
and not for track events, since failure at REALLY high speed could be
REAL BAD.  Don't comprimise on safety- whether it's your wheels, fire
suite, or any other safety equip- IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!! SPEND MONEY
ON THE THINGS THAT WILL 1) KEEP YOU SAFE 2) KEEP YOU ALIVE & 3) KEEP
YOU AROUND FOR THE NEXT TIME you have fun....  I could have been killed
in this accident and I will do things differently if I ever drive
in this kind of situation again..

Shortly after getting my '73 (and after changing the oil) the level
gauge starting reading *real full*.  Fortunately I was still in to checking
the oil level manually and found that the dipstick did not correlate with
the gauge reading.  Turned out to be dirty connections at the spade connectors
on the oil level sensor.  This seems like really stupid engineering: an open
circuit left the gauge indicating full!

Sounds like you were a little low on oil and you had a flakey connection -
probably didn't need to replace the level sensor.  I basically recrimped
the female spade connector, cleaned off the male connector, and made sure
they fit together firmly.  Haven't had any problems in 3 years.

crack in it(!) along the inside cup edge.  It was very hard

rotors fixed the problem (yikes -- don't ask how much 930

   to buy it. Boyoboyoboy, a Hazet toolbox just like the ones I used to use

   The next day I put it together. Nothing fit right. The Taiwanise 1/4-20 nuts

    A few thoughts:

    - Porsche made a number of improvements in the 944 in the second half
    of the 1985 model year.  I would look for an 85 1/2 or newer
    model...these are easily recognized by the newer style dash and
    instrument cluster.

    - Maintenance is every bit as important as mileage.  Without proper
    care and feeding, even a low mileage car  can be trash.  On the other
    hand, a well maintained Porsche will run a long time.  Insist on
    service history!

    - Water pumps and motor mounts have been weak points of early models.

Subject:  914 buying

Greetings gang,
I was so depressed from work yesterday that I went out and bought a Porsche.
Another Porsche I should say...for le$$ than a grand, and drove it home.

A shop downtown had it out in the back lot (they werent proud of it).
It's a '76 with a 2.0 and dual carbs (single barrel =:< ) and monza exh.
At one time it had air, but the pump and underdash stuff has been ripped
out.  The battery was shot and the engine lid hinges were broken off.
The color was earl scheib black over L80E (light Ivory) with black vinyl
seats, and the body is rusty in the usual places, but not as bad as my
recently rustored 914.  The rear deck lid hinges were both broken off
and the front trunk lid didnt fit because the tub was distorted in a way
I still havent figured out how. 
The original wheels were gone and in their place were four american mags
with michelin mxl's all 'round -no spare.  The front trunk is missing
the carpet and spare covering, and the fuel tank seems to leak.
The interior is pretty torn up and the carpet is missing on the driver
side.  The steering wheel is missing the centerpiece, the center console
pad is loose from it's hinge and the radio has been ripped out.
The windshield has a thin crack down the center and the passenger side door
wont open from inside or out.  The engine tin is missing all its fasteners
and a  mysterious zip cord passes thru to below... where the 'j' tubes
and heat valves WERE.

The shop wanted 995 and i offered ahem, less.  So they tried to start it
 -it ran poorly on less than 4 cylinders and spewed water out the monza's.
A couple weeks later i went back and they still had it and wanted to
sell it to me 'as is'.  My offer was considered, countered and I said OK.

So I put a battery in it and a couple gallons of premium and:
The clock showed 90 something under cloudy glass, and wires hung out from
under the dash (along with the ignition switch).  I put a screwdriver into
the switch and (hail Mary) twisted: The speedo and odo dont work, but 5  
miles later we get home, smoking and sputtering on sometimes less than
3 cylinders...and the oil light came on just as i drove up the driveway,
leaving a trail of oil.  A pushrod tube leak, i thought.

- --Begin Diagnostic and Detection Routine--

On cleaning the interior, I find over $7 in change, three cassette tapes
(prince, sade, and some funky rap) and about 25 pens and pencils, all
crammed under the seats.  Studying some of the receipts (trash) I see the
most recent date of transaction: Jan. 11 1993 (western auto) items: wiring, 
fog-off pads, muffler patch, and -binaca.  
Preliminary conclusion; the previous owner was a student with friends at
royal body shop (pen logo) who knew little about 914's.  The former
owner liked music and Porsche's, but could afford little of either.
Poor devil had bad breath but not bad enough to de-fog the windows because
of NO heat.  The zipcord went to a 'belly pan heater' Ah Ha! no choke!

Subject: 914/4 to 6

Nicholas Cole inquires about 914 upgrade from 4 to 6 cyl.; I reply from per-
spective of somewhat similar conversion of Vanagon.  First, I would only
consider Porsche 6, especially for a daily driver.  Some enthusiastic comments
on the net about a month ago (?) clarify why.  Second, you need to think
carefully about what you want to put in and what you want to get out.  Conver-
sion will keep the car off the road for a surprisingly long time, and will
use money that could have gone into the engine if you stayed with the 4.

My list of areas that needed solutions was: accelerator, heat, electrical,
gauges, flywheel/trans, engine support, oil tank, vacuum for brakes, shrouding,
muffler, fuel supply, and headroom for carbs and fanhousing.  Your list would
be similar.  Some of the solutions were measured in hours, some in weeks.  In
the 914 case, Porsche's brutally expensive solutions are an option, and there
are aftermarket solutions as well, so you would be able to trade money for 
time.  

I haven't toted up my bills yet, but I am certainly over $1000 excluding the
cost of the engine, and I have done all the work myself.  My work is mech-
anically sound, but cosmetically awful; if you wanted better, you'd need to 
budget even more dollars and/or time.  By the time you add in the price of a
good Porsche engine, you will be real close to affording a nice 914/6 instead
of a mutant.

In terms of $ per hp -- raw, raw estimates:
brandie new 2.4 liter Type 4 engine with carbs, $4000/130hp=30.8
serviceable 3.0 liter 6, including installation, $9000/200hp=45.0

Would love comments from others, and to hear what you decide.  You can't lose;
end result will be fun either way, but the two paths are real different.

I bought a non-running 77 911S with the original motor (that was rebuilt in
'90 and has around 15k miles on it since then).  I learned that before it
stopped running that it started to go thru the oil and smoke a little.  The
last symptoms was that the engine started to sputter and then died.  It was
then real hard to start and the only way to keep it running was to give it
gas.  Finally it died and wouldn't start.  When I got it there didn't seem
to be any oil in it and the engine wouldn't even turn (ok the blower moved
about an 1/8th of an inch when I turned the key over).  Now, before I go
ripping thru the engine, I thought that I would query the vast experience
of the mailing list to see if they had any suggestions.  I can give more

If you're running aftermarket brake pads, like Cool Carbons, you'll find 
that they're not manufactured to the same exacting tolerances (size-wise) as 
the OEM pads, and what you may be feeling is the slightly smaller backing 
plate seating and unseating.  If this is the case, it's not really anything

While everyone is still in the mood for yet more defrost questions.....

My '72 914 has had all the heater boxes, etc. replaced.  In other words,
the hardware is in place for heat.  My question concerns the top lever of 
the three (2 black knobs, one red) on the dash.  There are hash
marks for what appears to be fan speeds of I, II, III.  I can get air to
flow with the lever all the way to the right.  Moving the lever to the left
causes the airflow to cease rather abruptly.  Are there actually three 
distinct fan speeds, or is the fan speed gradual from zero to max?  When is
the blue light supposed to be on?

So, fuses, loose connection, bad fan?.....any good advice, suggestions, or
explanations welcome and appreciated.

Hi Pam!

I just ran out and checked the heater fan on my 1975 914.

Nothing appears to happen when the fan lever is in the blue "crescendo"
portion. But there are 3 different speeds: low - I, med - II, high - III.
The light behind the fan icon comes on anytime the fan is running.

You can wrestle the whole switch unit out through the front of the
dash. I think there is only one fuse for the motor (one of the regular
fuses in the fuse block).

Haynes (page 138 in mine) shows the switch assembly pulled out. After
checking to make sure that the moving "fingers" make proper contact, I
would check the resistance of each of the contact points (B, C, and D
in the switch) to ground. If points B and C are not "open" then you have
a gremlin. If they are open then you either have broken wires or bad
windings. Point D should read some resistance since the high speed works.

If they read open I'd try to do the same reading along the same wires as
close to the motor as possible.

Actually, I'd try doing the above with the switches in place if possible.
That way you don't have to undo the control cables. I think there's
enough room.

Hey! At least my car is good for answering those "stationary car"
questions. 8-)

Subject: RE: 914 fan for heat/defrost


Pam asked about 914 fan control - well if it is the same as that on a '72 911
there are three fan speeds selected from copper tracks on the base of the fan
control.  The blue light should come on when the fan runs (ie at position I).
My fan gave the same symptoms as Pam described and as it ran at all the fuse
was deemed ok and the tracks mentioned above were clean.  So I took the fan
housing out (removal is the reverse of installation :-) ) to see what was
what.

The power to the fan goes through a four pin plug on the fan housing (you
could check whether you had volts here - one pin is ground and the other
three get 12 volts depending on which speed setting is selected.  It is
possible to take the fan housing to bits by removing the spring clips all
round the join.  The plug socket can now be examined.  On the back there are
two large resistors which give the slower fan speeds for settings I and II.

Each resistor is "protected" by what I think is a bi-metalic strip switch.
Now this is where my knowledge of what this thing is designed to do ends as
the strips on my unit were very rusty and stuc closed - so the resistors were
shorted and the fan always ran at full speed (I, II or III) or was off.  As I
was not able to get the plug unit as a replacement (I think you have to buy
the whole fan unit $$$) I just bent the bi-metalic strips open and everything
works ok.  However they must have been there for a purpose - perhaps to
protect the resistors from overheating and burning out (anyone have any more
info on this).  I did this a couple of years ago and the fan has worked fine
since then.

Subject: 914/4 to 6

	Not owning a 914 myself but having friends who do, I thought I
might give you a couple of opinions. The most bang for the buck can be
had with the VW based engine. Not only the up front costs but especially 
thge maintance costs will be MUCH less. It also takes a much greater level
of owner knowledge to deal with the 6 as opposed to the 4 if you intend
to ever do much of the maintance yourself.  The conversion to the 6 is
actually rather straightforeward since Porsche did it and all the parts
are readily available. I'm sure others on the net have probably done this
themselves.  My suggestion: if you wish to basically leave the rest of the
car alone and drive it build the 4 to the 130hp level and enjoy.  If you 
intend to fully improve the chassis (welding in bracing required) and convert
to a 911 front suspension, overhaul the rear suspension, convert to 911
brakes all around (of course they come with the 911 front suspension) and
also convert to a 916 type transaxle, go with an older carburated 6 as
reccomended by the individual with the vanagon. Your conversion would
definitely be easier than his.  Of course you now have quite a different
car than you started with and a much bigger bill. The VW tranny will take
the lower torque 4 at 130hp with a stronger clutch and judicious sue of 
first gear on take off. The 6 will destroy it if you aren't verry careful.
From an economic only standpoint the 914 will not be worth the money which
is spent to fully convert it to a 916 (that transaxle is very expensive).
But then if that is what you want, and you really love that particular
car, it may be well worth it to you. My 356 isn't worth what I've spent on
it, but then, I don't care, thank you very much.  My personal feeling would
be to stay with the 4, but as everything else I've said this is only an
opinion.  At any rate, good luck in whatever you decide. Jonathan

The schematics show them as thermal overloads of some sort. So I think this is
correct. The only question I have is are they there to keep the resistors
from burning OUT, or burning UP. What's a little FIRE right next to the gas

Pretty sure you can order the knob, but I don't have a 911 fiche in

Here's the article.  There a drawing which goes along with it, and I

I deleted my own fog lights recently, to use their space in the air dam to
vent air to a new oil radiator.  Back to the drawing board...
_________________________________________________________________________

Upgrading your factory alarm                            Kevin Gross

With the '85= 944, Porsche introduced a factory alarm system which 
remained largely unchanged until the '89 model year.  When triggered, 
the alarm beeps a horn.  In '89, an additional option became available.  
Designated M484, cars equipped with this option strobe their fog lamps 
and stop lamps along with the horn.

Car alarms are often ignored these days because of the frequency of false 
triggers in motion-sensing types of alarms.  Strobing the lamps might 
make the difference between your car's alarm being ignored, and having 
it draw people's attention.  Fortunately, upgrading the 944-series alarms 
from pre-'89 with the M484 option is straightforward.


How it works
- ------------

The accompanying figure shows the part of the wiring diagrams we're 
interested in.  The key part is the block on the right, showing the new 
relay, G18, and its wiring.  Notice that it takes its input signal from the 
output of the Alarm Control Unit (ACU).  The same strobed 12-volt signal 
sent to the alarm horn is now also used to open and close the relay.

Operating the relay adds very little additional electrical load on the ACU. 

The real power to the fog lamps and stop lamps comes from a new fused 
circuit we'll add, using fuse #12.  The relay has two output circuits, one 
for the fog lamps and one for the stop lamps.


Wiring it
- ---------

Most of the work is simply running the new wires.  If you haven't read 
my article in the March Nor'easter describing the Central Electric Board, 
now would be a good time to do so.

Disconnect the negative lead from the battery, then lift the CEB out of its 
case.  The map inside the top of the case shows where relay G18, 
currently unused, will go.  Remove the punch-out from the CEB at this 
location.  We'll next run a number of wires to this location.  As I 
mentioned in the March article, be sure to run the new wires long the 
existing harness so that there is enough slack.

Start with a black 0.5 mm (20 AWG) from pin 1 of the ACU connector 
back to the CEB.  You'll find the alarm control unit clipped to the back of 
the Bosch DME computer.  Which is behind a wood panel in the 
passenger footwell.  Pull the connector off the ACU, then use a jeweller's 
screwdriver to depress the pin 1 connector's locking barb so that you can 
pull it from the connector block.  Clip off the old flat connector, and 
crimp a new one (N.017.491.8) to both the original black/red wire and to 
your new wire.

You will also have to add a red 1.0 mm. (16 AWG) wire to the stop light 
circuit.  There are a couple of places you could do this in the harness.  I 
found it simplest to run it to the stop light switch's plug on the brake 
pedal assembly.  Again, remove the red/white wire's connector from the 
two-pin plug, clip off the existing connector, and crimp a new one 
(N.017.491.8) onto both the red/white wire and the new wire.  Be careful 
here - the stop light is an important thing!  Consider both crimping and 
soldering.

Two down, three to go.  The next wire is a fat, 2.5 mm. (12 AWG) one 
which brings power from the CEB to the relay.  As you can see in the 
wiring diagram, it goes to plug location K31 in the CEB.  Use a 2.5 mm 
CEB connector (999.652.475.22).  Loop the wire down into the harness, 
through the first cable tie, and back up to where the relay will go.

Now the fog lamp wire.  This should be a green 1.5 mm wire (14 AWG).  It 
plugs into CEB location J11.  Finally, you need a brown 0.5 mm (20 
AWG) ground wire.  Crimp a 1/4" ring terminal onto it, and fasten the 
ring terminal to one of the ground blocks located next to the CEB, visible 
looking up from inside the driver-side footwell.


Final assembly
- --------------

You now have a bundle of five wires which need to have connectors put 
on their end, then be inserted into the relay socket.  Notice that the 
socket is in fact two pieces.  The top of it unlocks from the bottom by 
unlatching it on two sides.  Take it apart now and set aside the smaller 
top part.

You'll need a short length of red 1.5 mm (14 AWG) wire to bridge power 
to the stop lamps.  Crimp the large 4-6 mm. female flat connector 
(N.017.494.3) onto both this wire and the red 2.5 mm wire, then insert it 
into pin 4 of the socket.  Make sure the barb locks it in properly.

Crimp the rest of the female flat connectors onto the red, black, and 
green wires.  Crimp the funny-looking 2.8 mm connector (N.903.352.03) 
onto the brown wire.  Solder them as well, if you'd like.  Insert them all 
into the relay socket in the pin locations shown in the wiring diagram.  It 
matters which way the flat connectors are inserted: do it so that the 
locking barb engages.  If in doubt, check out an existing relay's socket.  
Reattach the top piece of the socket, then insert it into the CEB.  Add the 
15 amp fuse to circuit 12.  Plug in the relay.  You're done.

Almost.  Before plugging in the relay, I would test the signals at each of 
the socket pins.  With a multi-meter, look for zero ohms between pin 7 
and ground.  Look for 12 volts at pins 4 and 5.  Look for 12 volts at pin 7 
when you turn the fog lights on (ignition on and headlamps on).  Depress 
the brake pedal (ignition on) and look for that to bring 12 volts to pin 3. 

Finally, trigger the alarm and look for strobed 12 volts at pin 2.

My thanks once again to Mack Mackenzie at Clair Parts Express for his 
help in chasing down the parts and their numbers.

Carbon brake pads                                       Kevin Gross

Anyone who's been near motorsports in the last five years has no 
doubt heard the term "carbon fibre" bandied about a great deal.  There 
are in fact two different technologies being discussed.  I'll bring you 
up to speed on one of them.  But before getting to it, let me first talk 
briefly about the other one.

Which is carbon fibre as used in composite materials.  Composites 
combine some sort of fibre with a resin to form structural objects, 
such as a race car monocoque.  Generally, the fibre is first woven into 
a cloth.  Layers of this cloth are immersed in and joined with an 
adhesive, binding the fibres together and producing a material that is 
both light and at the same time strong.  The fibres are usually man-
made ones such as carbon, Kevlar, fibreglass, graphite, and recently 
ceramics.  The adhesives are typically phenolic, acrylic, polyurethane, 
or epoxy.

One of the first big users of carbon fibre composites was the Space 
Shuttle program, and indeed much of the development of current 
composite technology came from the Hercules company.  The state-
of-the-art was probably defined earlier this year by NPTI, Nissan's 
racing arm.  They revealed that they had developed and certified a 
sportscar monocoque plus roll cage made entirely from composites.  
No steel at all.  It withstood 1.5 times the static load test to which 
FISA subjects WSC cars, and did so without any structural failure.  
On top of that, the design weighed 40% less than a similar unit made 
the old fashioned way.

But enough of that.  What I really want to write about is the use of 
carbon in high performance braking systems.  Terms like "carbon 
fibre brakes" and "carbon-carbon" or "carbon-Kevlar" get tossed 
about.  What's it all mean?

Until a few years ago, pads were commonly made from a mixture of 
asbestos fibres, metals, other friction material, binders, curing agents, 
and a bunch of other black magic.  Like soft drinks, a manufacturer's 
recipe for brake pad material is a closely kept secret.  The asbestos 
fibres had the same sort of role as straw does in adobe, or steel in 
concrete: they give a degree of mechanical strength to the pad.  They 
also provide some of the pad's frictive characteristic.

Racers have two sometimes conflicting needs of their brakes.  They 
need to stop quickly, and they need to stop reliably.  The older 
"organic" and "metallic" brake pad compounds would produce a 
coefficient of friction of only about 0.28 when used with a cast iron 
rotor.  Moreover, when worked very hard at the track, they would fade 
or disintegrate as heat became excessive.  "Harder" compounds 
were developed, such as the venerable Ferodo DS-11, but they had 
their thermal limits as well, and worked very poorly until they got 
good and hot.

The aerospace industry again came to the rescue.  Gordon Murray 
adapted the carbon-carbon technology used by Dunlop in brake rotors 
for the Concorde aircraft, to producing pads and rotors for the 
Brabham Formula 1 team.  They found themselves with brakes that 
were light, strong, able to withstand tremendous temperatures, and on 
top of that, with a coefficient of friction that could exceed 0.5.  
Moreover, this coefficient of friction was available over a wide range 
of component temperatures.  Another benefit they found was that the 
carbon pad material conducts heat less than older compounds, 
meaning less heat delivered to the callipers and reduced problems 
with the boiling of brake fluid.

The term "carbon-carbon" tends to be used by people in two different 
ways.  To some people, it describes the combination of carbon brake 
rotors with carbon pads.  To others, it refers to the way these brakes 
and rotors are made: a carbon matrix produced by vacuum cracking 
hydrocarbons at great temperature, reinforced by carbon fibres.  
Substitute Kevlar fibres for carbon ones, and you have a carbon-
Kevlar material such as is used by Cool Carbon in their line of 
products.

Like many things in the aerospace industry, this technology was far 
from cheap.  Which is probably why the Continental Circus was its 
first outside application.  Two companies, Hitco and Carbone 
Industrie, have been responsible for virtually all the carbon-carbon 
brake technology used in Formula 1.  More recently, they and other 
companies have begun supplying brake pads based on this technology 
to more and more motorsport series, as well as street cars.
Today there are at least two companies making carbon brake pads for 
street Porsches: Cool Carbon and Performance Friction.  Both 
companies manufacture pads in several different compounds, and 
selecting the right one depends on the weight of your vehicle and 
driving style.  These pads are priced competitively with OEM brake 
pads.

My personal experience has been with Cool Carbon pads over the 
course of the last two years.  It's been a very positive one, both driving 
on the street, at autocrosses, and at the track.  Their carbon-Kevlar 
pads stop very well both cold (that first autocross run of the day) and 
hot (that last run group at the track).  

Cool Carbon pads include a unique ceramic insulating layer between 
the steel backing plate and the carbon-Kevlar pad, allowing even less 
heat to conduct into the calliper.  We calibrated this on my car at a 
few track events this season, using thermal paint on the front rotors, 
pads, pad backing plates, and callipers.  We saw temperatures in 
excess of 560 degrees C (1040 degrees F) in the rotors and on the pad 
at the pad/rotor interface.  Despite these temperatures, and using AP 
550 brake fluid with its dry boiling point of 550 degrees F, I have 
experienced no problems with boiling.

Ok, any disadvantages?  Two minor ones.  They do squeal at times, a 
problem shared with most brake pads since asbestos has been fazed 
out for health reasons.  If this bothers you, Porsche makes anti-squeal 
shims for most models' brakes.  There is also a variety of paint-on 
rubbery liquids available that work fairly well.

The other disadvantage is that the brake dust produced by carbon pads 
seems to bond quite aggressively to both plain alloy and painted 
wheels.  Weekly cleaning with, for example, P21S should keep your 
wheels looking good.  Where I've been negligent in my ablutions, a 
little polishing compound has done the trick.

There are two widely held myths about carbon pads which I'd like to 
dispel.  The first is that the pads do not require any bedding-in or heat 
cycling to avoid "green fade" at the track.  Not true.  My experience 
has been that these pads require at least as much heat cycling as 
asbestos pads did, and perhaps more.

The other myth is that carbon pads aggressively wear rotors.  I haven't 
had this experience.  However, bear in mind that with these pads, you 
can generate more heat in shorter periods of time, and an overheated 
rotor will wear or degrade more quickly.  Make sure that your braking 
system is adequately cooled.



Braking Tidbits

A number of PCA members lucky enough to own new 911's have had 
problems with their first brake pad change.  These cars have come 
from the factory with anti-squeal liners (dampers) glued to the back of 
their pads.  Unfortunately, the liners have protrusions which insert 
into the calliper piston bores, making removal of the pads impossible 
without first breaking the glue seal between the pad backing plate and 
the liner.  I've found that using a 1" putty knife helps.  Make sure that 
it has a fairly sharp edge.  Shim it between the liner and the pad's 
backing plate, cutting the glue seal.  You will then be able to first 
slide out the pad, then work out the liner.

AP Racing has issued a technical bulletin warning customers against 
mixing their AP600 high temperature brake fluid with other glycol-
based fluids, including their own AP550.  The problem is apparently 
one of crystals precipitating out of the mixture and potentially 
interfering with the operation and sealing of the brake system.

Subject: Monthly Update

November 1993

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

Still mired deep in the swamps of Jersey, as one famous Jersean (Jerseyite?)
put it long ago... Again, your tolerance is appreciated as I take far too long
to process routine requests.  One energetic volunteer is about to go on-line
as a "substitute me", which will be an interesting experiment. See, first I 
have to get all this info out of my head...

Oh, my "normal" e-mail and phone continue to work (you'll get my voice mail
on the phone). New e-mail (stan@netsmiths.com) also works, but for now the 
bits still go to Houston so it's no faster/better/whatever.  My phone number 
in New Jersey is (908) 287-8070 -- you may get voice mail there too.

Am I moving? Let's just say "it depends". But nothing will happen until
at least Feb '94 at the earliest.

COPYRIGHT AND FAIR USAGE STATEMENT

The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence by and between
members of a closed community. As such, the copyright for EVERYTHING that 
ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 7 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.


CLUB-INFO

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, PLEASE join!! 
This info is also on-line in /pub/pca/info, in case you forget to save

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (800) 582-6892.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Quick plug here -- get a rebuilt from Jay Pineau (he advertises in
Pano, Excellence, etc). His pumps are very high quality and very
reasonably priced. Tell him I sent you --he'll get a kick out of
that, too.

Cool Carbons
- -------------

Thanks Kevin for the interesting article about composite
material brake pads. Someone recommended me the Cool carbons
earlier but I have not seen anyone selling them.

Any advice where to look?

Bumper shocks
- ---------------

My car had a minor impact on the front bumper on the ferry ride
from germany to sweden (private import). This was repaired by
a Porsche repair shop but when I took the bumper off last winter
I saw how the "repair" was done. The deformation zone of the shock
had been deformated some 5 mm and also partially cracked. 

The fix they made was to have a thicker rubber pad between the
bumper and the shock. This worked estetically but today 8 - 9
years after the repair the shock has started to corrode why
it will probably not do the job next time...


Brushes
- ------------

Sorry for the "Swenglich" word coals.

Subject: Winter Storage

I'm about to store my '86 944 for the winter. It will be garaged, and,
as I will be away, will not be driven for at least two months,
probably getting back on the road in late March, when the salt and
sand wash away. Is there anything I should do to prepare it for
storage? Gas stabilizers? Put it on stands? Change the oil?

Thanks very much,

Subject: seat bracket question

Trying to solve a little adaptation problem.

My 69 911S came with an extra pair of 86 911 seats with rectangular
bar adapters to bolt to the same mounting points as the rally seats
currently in the car...however the 86 seats have no provision for
mounting the seat belts to the frame as on the early seats.

Are there any adapter brackets made to solve this problem...what
have people done when putting aftermarket seats in early cars...I am
trying to avoid having custom brackets welded up...it would be
easier to buy brackets that need a little modification.


thanks in advance.

Howydy!

I really did have a broken sending unit.  I took everything apart first just
to make sure (I had already tried the *put the wire back on, check all the
connections* route).  Take one apart and you'll find out that the sending unit
works by sliding a metal arm over an exposed wire-wound resistor: a simple and
effective way to do it!  Anyway, as the arm slides over the exposed wire it,
of course, *eats* part of it.  After many years of fluctuating oil levels this
can wear thru the wire of the wire-wound resistor, causing an open circuit.
This is what happened to my unit.  As to the *open circuit equals full gauge*,
that has to do with the sensing of a small change in resistance with an 
unsteady voltage source (like the battery/alternator set-up in cars).  Being the
*Curious George* type of electrical engineer I drew everything out and figured
out how the system works.  Looked to be a pretty good way to handle the total
system to me.

BTW, I'm still looking for the answers to my questions:  What's going on w/
my dipstick/float combination and can I just cut off the old dipstick? 
Thoughts, anyone?

Thanks to Kyle Kehler for his thoughts on refinishing my oil tank.  I'm going
to use the Wurth stuff to coat the outside of the tank - it had some undercoat 
on it  orginally! ;-)


Thanks.

Paul,

Hello!  I've just done the same thing to my '75 911.  I acted a little too
early, though - we had some great driving weather the weekend after I took
the insurance off!

Well, here's all I'm going to do for storage:

1.  Charge the battery once a week.  I'll turn on an interior light for three
or four hours to drain it a little and then charge it up.  Lots of different
*trickle* type chargers around, I'm just going to use the low setting on my
manual job.

2.  Change the oil before too much longer ;-)  I'm short on free-time at the
moment.  I'll run it for a week or so this spring and then change the oil
again - gets all the water/gunk out.  I always do a filter change.  Even at
$10 a pop for a filter it's the cheapest 911 motor part around!

3.  Fill the tank up all the way before storage.  This keeps water for conden-
sating in the tank.

4.  Start the thing and let it run for about 20 minutes every two weeks or
so.  DON'T let it just idle though, keep the revs up so you have good oil
flow and everything comes up to temp.  Me, I'm going to open up all the garage
windows/doors, sit behind the wheel and pretend I'm racing down some Alpine
mountain pass in my Porsche.... ;-)

5.  Lots of different opinions on paint car.  I'd wash it down real good,
outside, underside, inside and wax it up.  Use a car cover if you have one
but I'm not going to sweat it.  Just wash it again this spring!

6.  Don't put it on stands for extended periods.  It will expose the shock
absorbers to corrosion.  I'm going to have my on stands for a while for some
work but then I'll take it down.  Just air up the tires to 55 psi or so and
roll it back and forth once a week.  Keeps from flat-spotting the tires.

This is by no means a complete list of what to do but it is the obvious.  Look
in the archieves or in Up-Fixin' for a more complete description.  Anyone
have any other ideas/tips?

Good luck and keep dreaming of spring!

Subject: carbon fiber brakes

re kevin's article on carbon brakes, i have some comments/questions regarding
bedding in procedures.

i got some cool carbons and a new set of front rotors this summer.  unfortunately
i missed a track event in the process and had to bed them in on the street (better
anyway, you say?  tell me why if you think so!).  per instructions, i warmed the
brakes up a little bit by dragging them a bit, then ran the car up to 70-80 and
braked hard to 40 or so, repeating until the brakes faded, then proceeded on my
way (across the country, as it turned out).

some time later i noticed that hard braking resulted in big-time shudder.  this
was 2000 miles later (nearly home).  later at a track event i encountered the
same shuddering until about the 3rd run session, when everything was fine.

happened again yesterday, only it got better faster.  actually it seems like they
shudder when cold, then are fine after about 5 laps.

are my rotors warped?  do these pads deposit goo on them while squealing in street
use?  why does it get better late in the track day?

There's one thing the article forgot that is generally done when alarms are
used to flash lights; add a diode between the alarm output and relay.  If a
thief should happen upon upon your car and set off the alarm, they could pop
off a light, short the leads, and cause enough current to be drawn to fry the
alarm control unit.  Now, I don't know how common it is for thieves to do this,
or whether or not it would actually work (doesn't seem to likely to me; I
think the fuses for the lights would pop first), but given that a diode is only
$.80 at Radio Shack, why take a chance?

If it's anything like North Carolina, most auto insurance companies will not
write exclusionary policies - you will have to lie to them and say you are
not married.  Of course if your wife gets in a wreck in your car, you are SOL.
I went through that problem a couple of years ago (with the reverse ticket
distribution in the marriage).  In under 2 months we'll have a clean driving

Liberty is consistently in the toilet when auto insurers are evaluated
by organizations such as Consumers Union.  However, oddly enough, I have
had excellent service from their Lexington, Mass. office over the last
five years.  I think that has a little to do with the fact that Lexington
is a well-to-do suburb.

Bart asks about shuddering.

Did it start at or right after a track event?  If so, I would suspect
material transfer from the pads to the rotors.  This normally will clear
up after a few hundred miles of street driving.  If it doesn't, you may
have warped rotors.

The solution, in either case, would be to cool your rotors with something
like the Holbert Cool Brake set-up.

I don't have this fresh in mind but the 911 (at least '77 - '82) transmission
oil has to meet the GL5 norm (hypoid additative). The Mobil 1, if I recall it
correctly, was therefore not recommended (I can be wrong). Mobilube 
SHC 75/90W (synthetic) meets this requirement and was therefore used in 
my gearbox. Works fine although I have not driven in in winter temperatures.

P.S. The filling is quite messy. I took a long hose, taped it to the filling
hole so the filling could be done above the RH rear wheel.

I had a 1971 Porsche 914-6 incinerated in one of the recent fires in

While I was poking around at it yesterday, it occurred to me to wonder

story about a guy who tried to convert 914-4 into -6, and I've heard  
rumors about people putting together cars around a particular VIN.  I'd  
be interested in hearing opinions about the value of a VIN for a

Subject: Winter Storage

Paul and anyone else

John's advise will work but some argue that running for 20 minutes with no
load on the engine is not good, I'm not sure why but P-cars seem to thrive
on stress.  More important, if you're in a cold climate, just remove the
battery and put it on a trickle charger outside the car.  The worst thing,
maybe even worse than rodents nesting in your air cleaner, is to have your
battery freeze, break and run all over everything as you spend the winter by
the fire dreaming of summer driving!

I recommend the fresh oil change and fillup; I'd add that if you don't run
premium octane gas that you make this fillup with premium.  I've read/heard
that the gas can degrade as it just sits there (anyone care to enlighten
us?).

Avoid the stands or blocks but DO pump up the tires.  Rolling back and
forth is supposed to be good for both the tires and the bearings.

I like a product made in my neighborhood called OMNI BAG (approx $95).  It
is a heavy gage plastic bag that you roll your car into, toss in a couple of
desicant tubes (which come with the bag), fold up the end, and clamp it with
some heavy clamps (which also come with it).  The car comes out just like it
goes in.  Even in an unheated Michigan garage for the winter brake disks
come out with no rust at all.  (I've seen a reddish rust film form overnight
in some climates.)  I'm not affiliated with the company in anyway except I
bought the bag!  The owners are Porsche folks (and Alfa's) anyway.
I'll post the details if anyone is interested.  Granted, there is a problem -
it's kind of difficult to go out and sit in the car pretending winter's
over.

Is this 5 sp trans from the early 912 the same (identical) 901-type trans as
that in the early 911?  The 5sp was never available in any of the 356s, 
right?

Just to add my $.02...

I'd opt for the key socket and ratchet setup.  I purchased the
big hex wrench and found it to be a pain in the butt.  It was hard
to get it seated correctly (in part due to the incredible precision
used in the manufacturing of this tool ;-)).  Don't get me wrong, it
worked, but, the key socket with a short extension would be much 

better IMHO.

It may be possible to find the key socket from Sears/Craftsman if 

you're not inclined to chasing a Snap-On truck...

 During the past year of autocrossing and such, I encountered binding
of the shifter on the G50 in the RS America after the car had been
running continuously under load and temps up.  I called the dealership
about this phenomenon and was told that I was not the only one who 

had experienced the problem.  I asked whether changing tranny fluid
to synthetic would help and was told NOT to use synthetic in the G50.
The reasoning was that the synthetic is TOO slippery and causes problems
with the synchros.  As it turns out, the binding problem is apparently
the result of heat expansion of the linkage components.  


FWIW: I did use synthetic in the 915 of my '82 SC with no ill effects...

Casting is when molten steel is poured into a mold and allowed
to cool.  The molten steel forms in the shape of the mold.  There
are different types of casting, for instance you can use sand
molds which are just "cracked" off the steel molding once has
hardened.

Forging is when hot steel is forced into a new shape.  For instance,
if you took a yellow hot steel rod and hit it with a hammer until
it was in the shape of a bar, you would have "forged" the bar.
Forgings are generally much stronger than cast parts.

A typical way to make, say a crankshaft, would be to cast 
a shape close to the desired shape, forge it, then machine
the surfaces that need close tolerances (bearing surfaces, etc.)
Something like a engine block will usually be cast (with a
sand mold) then the cylinders will be machined for higher
tolerances.

I happened to have a copy of our Motor-Stadt newsletter and the information
I was going to offer tomorrow is in it.  (Lotsa good things come when you
join PCA - do it now if you haven't already.)

(517) 641-4881  call for a brochure

Small bag is what you need for any Porsche.

They advertise it for "indoor use."  I asked them why and they said because
of problems outside with wind whipping the bag against the car - bad for
the finish.  My guess is the bag is plenty strong enough to with stand
anything but a major ice storm.

Our Porsche Club had an "ice cream social" at Pine Ridge Farm (the locale
for the "enterprise") and saw some vintage Alfa Romeo's in bags in a barn.
The barn was not very tight - the roof and walls had/has some major holes
and birds and bats were making deposits right on the bags.  The droppings
had no effect, nor did the rain coming in through the holes.  Inside, the
cars were immaculate.

Again, I have no financial interest or connection to this company but if you
contact them please mention that you heard of them through the MotorStadt
Porsche Club we will keep one of our advertisers happy!

Subject: RE71....and the RE71R's


Just wanted to add some positive notes on the RE71Rs, since I have seen 
so much bad news about them here. I drove on them for a year or so 
before switching to Yoko 008Rs, like many did here in Seattle. The 
RE71Rs are great tires in the rain, very forgiving, and easy to drive. 
They give lots of warning and you don't have to be very precise while 
driving them. They don't last very long (shaving them to 2/32's helps) 
, and you need to keep the pressures up or they will roll over and 
trash the sidewall. The Yokes are faster, stiffer, and last much 
longer, partly because they have a harder compound and stiffer sidewall 
but also because the outside tread is molded as almost a solid block. 
They aren't as good in the rain as an RE71 with tread. The Yoke's 
require a tidier driving style since they won't slide as much, but I 
think they are a better 911 tire than the RE71 (the old Yoke RTUs of 
the same era were worse). So the RE71 is a great tire to learn on and 
you will have lots of fun. Use em up and then you can use the Yokes at 
the track. Or, do what some do and leave the RE71 at full depth and 
drive them on the street (expect about 10k miles and lots of rock 
chips)...but they are so soft it rides like a caddy!

The transmissions are almost the same, some gearing being different.
I forget exactly *what* the differences were, but remember exploiting
them as I robbed gears from both a 912 and a 911 to make a "better"
914 gearbox...

And you never could get a 5-speed for the 356, true. You could, in

That's interesting, because a few years ago I heard Bruce Anderson say 
to an audience that just running it for 20 or so minutes wasn't all 
that good.  You need full water/oil temps, and should rotate all parts 
(bearings, xmission gears, CV's, shocks, steering rack, etc.).  If he's

Well, the PCNA part comes with a warranty and is rebuilt as an OEM 
replacement, i.e., we/they hope it's within original specs.  If the 
thing fails, PCNA will help you fix the problem again.

Unless Automotion sells EXACTLY the same part, I'd be leary - I've seen 
too many "original" parts with identical part numbers from the original 
manufacturer, that are out of spec or otherwise inferior.  Through the 
PCNA channel, you're guaranteed highest quality.

You might consider the extra $182 as insurance.  What's the labor to 
replace the new pump if it goes bad?

Anyway, Patty, this is just a critical opinion from someone who demands 
high quality parts and performance!  Hope this helps,

   My brother worked on Ferrari's, Bentley's, Rolls, Saab, etc.
   He never said anything like that.

   ** The battery-on-the-floor routine **IS** an old wive's tale. **
   ** Many years ago when batteries where constructed of tar and ockum(sp?)
   this may have been true, not with today's plastics tho'.

   Since your locale has winter, perhaps the battery being on the shelf
   actually kept it from freezing (heat rises) solid in the garage.
   When a battery loses it's charge, it can freeze. <bad>
   An unused battery will lose ~10% or more of its charge each month.
   As temperature drops, a battery's efficiency also drops.
   At 0'c a battery in good condition may have only 50% of its rated CCA
   (cold cranking amps).  CCA is usually rated at ~20'c (room temp)

   ** The best thing for a car battery is USE.  If you have to store a 
   battery for a season, the best thing is to give it a jolt of use
   at intervals (your choice < 30 days) in between charges.
   A low rate draw would be OK if the cycle does not go too deep.
   (car radio/tape deck).
 
   **  As cheap as batteries are these days,
   blow off maintenance and buy a new one (two) every 2-3 years to
   avoid a surprise and prevent damage to your car's electricals.

   ** I have seen sears offering an intelligent battery charger
   and maintenance device...~$60.  Seems to handle deep cycle
   batteries as well as car batteries.  I will get one if they
   have one in stock (they must be good, cuz they're always out).

If the OMNIBAG can touch the surface directly, it sounds like you could
put the it on a car and then put your car cover OVER both to hold it down.
Adding a bungee cord between the two bottom waist grommets (security

Does anyone out there know some of the technical details of the Bosch ABS
systems Porsche uses on their later model 2wd cars?  I'm hoping to adapt
the 928S4 computer to a 4wd Porsche based prototype being built at Rice
University in Houston.  We're using Torsen style worm and spur gear 
limited slip diffs front, rear, and center.  They are free on overrun and in
braking, so they won't interfere with the 4 wheel slip sensor system used
in the Bosch ABS as badly as in a Carrera 4.  I believe that model uses
two different sensitivity settings based on an additional acceleration 
sensor for slick and normal road conditions.  The 2wd computers don't need
this because the front wheels are always free to rotate and can be used 
as references.

Any info on the Bosch systems would be of interest.  Anyone know of a 
good book (short of the Bosch manuals which I have on order)?

Subject: Winter is NOT Wunderbar

Here's some discussion/responses on this subject:

1.  Move to Arizona

In a heart beat!  Actually, I'd rather go to New Mexico but...  I'm stuck
here for awhile.

2.  Bruce Anderson Disagreeing... With Himself! (I don't think so...)

I looked up my source.  It was an old article in Up-Fixin' (Vol VII)
and in it he agreed with an earlier Up-fixin' article by someone else.
Run the car every once in awhile to keep water/corrosion out of the motor.
The earlier article is in Vol III.  Don't have page numbers with me.

In any event, I would under no circumstances:  a) let a motor sit for six
months without being started (unless you did some preservation - oil down
the cylinders, put in water-absorbing plugs, etc. as outline in the Vol III
article) or b) start a motor w/o letting it come up to temp.  That's the idea
behind letting it run at above idle (see my original post) for 20 min or so.
It drives away the moisture and splashes lots of oil around.

I agree w/ Bruce - rotate all parts that normally rotate.  Good idea.  Since
I'll have stands and a floor jack handy, that could be accomplished rather
easily.  Put it in gear and hope to god that it doesn't fall off the stands!

Is he changing tune?  I don't really think so.  It comes down to, as usual:
Use it or lose it!  It's bad to let it just sit.  I couldn't find any more
recent articles in the Up-Fixin' Index and haven't looked thru my un-indexed
issues recently.  Anyone remember any more recent (>85 or so) articles?

In any event, I think it's a must start the car everyonce in awhile and
exercise it.  Not everyday but more than zero times in six months!

3.  Batteries on concrete...

I usually keep a board or piece of insulation between the battery and the floor
if they are sitting out in the cold.  I guess don't really know why except that
it seems that a concrete floor is nice way to conduct heat from an object and
freeze it!  So, a little insulation allows the battery to warm up some as it
is charged.  Of course, if you go to the extreme and take it in the house, put
LOTS of stuff between it and your carpet or you'll have this battery-shaped
hole where the carpet used to be...

I concure w/ Kyle - put a load on the battery before you charge it.  Drain it
a little w/ the interior lights and your favorite cassette tape.  Then charge
it up.  I've done battery work for the Air Force so I've had to read up on
all these sorts of things.  Don't tell my boss but I'd rather be reading up
on Porsche stuff...

Well, I'm sure there's more to be said on the subject.  Thoughts?

Subject: Batter storage

	Not suprising the battery has a shorter life if on concrete during
the winter. More efficient thermal conductivity to the battery from the
concrete than from whatever shelving material you have (most likely).
Cold will lower the solubility of the electrolyte (depending on state of
charge) and can lead to your plates more rapidly ending up as salts on 
the bottom of the case instead of where they belong. No, I didn't go into
all the details here (such as why concrete never reaches ambient temp in 
the winter, at least the concrete in your garage or the details of the ion
exchange process occuring in the cells). Point is try to keep a battery as
warm as possible, below the vapor point of the electrolyte of course, during
the winter. Charging it will help it last longer if it must be exposed to
cold.    good luck JB

Heavens, no!  I don't know if your car smells like mine but I wouldn't
change a thing!

Since my first Porsche in 1969 (a '66 912) I've noticed that familiar
smell in every 911 I've owned.  It is distinctive, and not at all unpleasant
(to me, anyway).  In fact, it brings back so many memories that I
intentionally breathe deeply when I get in for the first time each
morning.  Next I pull on my driving gloves.  And then Walter Mitty comes
to mind...

I've often wondered what causes it since some of my cars had vinyl,
cloth, and leather interiors and yet all smelled alike.  But I've never once
considered anything to mask it.

I always thought every other owner felt the same.  Now I'm wondering if
something's wrong with me.

There's always the master list of the cars from VIN numbers .. serious

I recently purchased a 914 1.7. it was imported from the US to New
Zealand in 1973 with 1000 miles on the clock. It has done 45,000
miles and has been stored since 1988. I am currently doing a
check over and a few repairs before I start the engine.  I am
replacing all rubber hoses as some have perished.

A few questions......

    1. Other than the hoses are there any other items that need
checking?, eg injectors sensors etc.  I will change oil and filter,
put some oil down the bores, turn the engine over by hand and put
fresh petrol (gas) in the tank.

    2. The 914 is fuel injected. I have heard conflicting comments
about the relative merits of fuel injection versus carbs....any

    3. My 914 has some rust in front of the windscreen, and around the

I agree, I love the smell of my 911, and it smells like all the other
911s that I have driven/been in. A mixture of leather, hot metal
and fine petrochemicals.

I would add that high-end motor car designers do pay attention to
olfactory requirements. I belive that luxury cars for the Japanese market
have special non-smelly leather selected for the interiors because
the Japanese find very smelly leather offensive.

    It's a very good idea to check the elbow hoses that connect the
    injectors to the fuel "T".  These hoses were known to crack
    causing fuel to spray the engine compartment.  (Can you say fire?)
    Sometime last year, PCNA told Pano that a recall is still in effect 
    to replace these hoses.  You'll need to bring your VIN to the dealer 
    to see if this service has been performed on your car.  If it has, 
    and the hoses look cracked, *replace them*.  It's worth the effort.
    
    You might just want to see if it turns over before you do too
    much work.  The less you change, the less new problems you have
    to contend with.

    See the net for the ongoing survey of FI vs carbs.  I have FI
    which is working just fine, but when I put a 2.0l in the car
    (1970 914) next year, I'll change to carbs.  By the way...anyone 
    have a 2.0 for sale?  I have a complete 1.8 for sale.


|     3. My 914 has some rust in front of the windscreen, and around the

| 
    Unfortunately, if it's quiet, you can hear a 914 rust.  I wouldn't
    worry too much about the rust in front of the windscreen, but the
    battery rust may be a major problem.  (Take it fromn someone who
    did a *complete* rebuild of the car for this reason.)  The problem
    is this: water hitting the battery would mix with the sulfuric acid
    present on the outside of the battery and drain down into the structure
    of the car.  The acid would corrode the metal around the battery tray
    and the area from the trailing arm inside mounting point to the right
    rear floor.  (I've seen even worse.)  As you might imagine, this makes
    a "Flexible Flyer" even more so.  Check this area from all angles
    as well as possible.  Tapping lightly on the underside with a hammer
    will give you audible cues as to the integrity of the structure.
    If the hammer goes through...well...

    A recall to add a cover to the battery is also still in effect.

    I'm glad you could participate.  It's always nice to help a fellow
    Porsche owner.  Remember, the answers you get are opinions, and you 
    should always do your homework before taking on the problem: ask the 
    net, read publications, and talk to trained service technicians...then 
    take the average.  Some people on the net like to consider themselves 
    a "guru" and will attack others who have differing opinions.  This act 
    is called "flaming".  Be cautious of the flames!

No, but then again I'm not boy-racer. I wonder if the tire blew out
first, thus causing the rim to bottom out against the pavement and
self-destruct. This sounds like a possibility to me, rather than the
rim itself actually exploding. A little forensic engineering should
lead to the answer, and thus the clearing of the fine BBS name.

Lins Kerr inquires where else to look for rust on his 914.  There is room
behind the rocker covers for whole families of small marsupials, and rust.
After I bought my 914, I pulled the jack points off with my bare hands.  Take
a look while the doors still close.  Similar dangers up under the vinyl on the

Hope you find lots of solid metal.  Maybe the trunk lid rusts first since

Yeah, there are some. When I bought my 914 I thought it was rust free - that
opinion got changed once i had a closer look into the engine bay with the
engine out. There is a "sink" just behind the firewall where water running
down over the battery can collect. It should have a hole in it for drainage
which easily plugs up. There might be rust down into the frame, and forward
into the firewall. This area is also rust prone on the left side of the car.
Then, there might be rust inside the lower firewall (i.e. the part of the
firewall if you look from the underside of the car; this is hollow, the
upper firewall isn't). That will most likely show up as rust in the left and
right rear corners of the floor pan and rust from the lower firewall into the
passenger compartment. The area behind and below the seats is also in danger
if the rear window's seals are bad: while driving in rain, water gets sucked
in and stays forever between the metal and the sound proofing rubber there.
You'd have to rip out most of the interior in the rear to see into these
places, not a great fun. Inside rust in the front floor pans and around the
pedals is also likely from leaky windows, wet shoes, spilled coffee etc; i had
enough of it and didn't dare to look too closely (and removing the sound deadener
on the floor pans is a real pain.).
Enough of that unpleasant stuff...

Subject: Phosphate-Free Coolant

FYI:

As I posted earlier, Prestone now makes a phosphate-free coolant
called "4/60."  I requested learned opinions on the product but 
got no response.  So I applied my golden rule:  If you want it 
done right, do it your damn self.

Contents of VW Autobahn coolant (blue): 

ethylene glycol (107-21-1)
diethylene glycol (11-46-6)
sodium tetraborate (1303-98-4)
sodium benzoate (532-32-1)

contents of Prestone 4/60 (yellow):

ethylene glycol (107-21-1)
diethylene glycol (11-46-6)
disodium sebacate (17265-14-4)

contents of "normal" coolant (green) include dipotassium phosphate
(7758-11-4) which is the aluminum corrosion culprit.  It is absent
in both above-mentioned coolants.

Performance-wise, all three coolants advertise freezing points of
 -34 degrees F for 50/50 mix with water.

Seems to me this makes Prestone 4/60 suitable for Porsches (water-
haulers only, of course).

A note about "Sierra" and other propylene glycol-based coolants.
There was a write-up in European Car (you should be skeptical
already) about "Mecca" cooling systems, using this type of
coolant.  With a few mods, such as a new thermostat and pressure
relief valve, cooling systems can be adapted to run with pure
coolant (ie. no water added).  This is a zero-pressure system,
with a higher boiling point, lower freezing point, but less heat
capacity (water has very high specific heat).  Big selling
points are corrosion resistance, 100,000 mile lifespan, and
environmental friendliness.

The Valentine One is wonderful.  Fantastic range and the directional
arrows are very useful.  Current V1s do detect the latest wideband, and
according to my conversation with them about a month ago, owners of older
V1s will be getting a letter offering an upgrade for $30.  You do
have to use a power cord however, and I believe that there is still a
backlog, although not as bad as when it first came out.  Overall, an
excellent product.

Netters,

Speaking of batteries, has anyone with an older twin-battery 911
converted to a single battery configuration?  I saw a kit in 
the Automotion catalog that looked pretty slick for around $150.00.
It included a strangely shaped battery, tie down strap, and I assume
cables.

Has anyone done this?  Any leads on a cheaper source than Automotion?

Not those, or on a 911 Turbo, but ... way back in '83 or so, I had a
set of (original) EMPI 2-piece wheels (with 195/60-15 P6s) on my '72
Super Beetle. One night I was taking a fairly rapid corner, when all of
a sudden the there was a jarring sensation and a huge clunking noise
from the outside rear wheel. I thought a wheel had fallen off, but in
fact it had split in two; several of the bolts had sheared off. The tire
was fine, but I had to buy some EMPI clone wheels as replacements... :(

The explanation I believed at the time was that originally ('69 or so)
the EMPI wheels were made for racing use, and this used a different
aluminum alloy.  This alloy was supposed to be stronger, but it was
more suspect to metal fatigue as it aged.

I don't know whether there's any truth to that theory, but...

Hi everybody.  It's me, James Saxon,

I'm off the mailing list but here in spirit.  I've got a question I hope 
you can answer.

In my 84 944 I was in an accident recently.  To make a long story short.  A 
pedestrian stood in my lane (with attitude).  I changed lanes to avoid.  So 
did he (to make contact).  I can only assume he was trying to get insurance 
money off of me.  Anyway, he's not going to get it.  Unfortunately, I chose 
the center divider.  Crunch.  Radiator, Spoiler, A/C condenser.  

The adjuster wants to offer "equal" parts that aren't Porsche.  If you 
remember a couple of months ago, I queried everybody on whether I should 
blow the $$$ and get a new tranny.  Well, I did and I was planning on 
keeping the car for a long time.  Now the insurance company wants to give 
this line about these non Porsche parts being equal (though they are 50% 
the price of the OEM parts).  

What's your opinion?  Can anybody give me official E-Mail stating clearly 
the fact that a non-porsche part is not equal to one?  Has anybody dealt 
with State Farm or insurance companies like this?

Thanks for the help.

E-Mail me directly.  Sorry about the compuserve address...

I've heard of this magnesium turbo cup wheel before was it ever an option
on lesser 951's? Or was it only available through racing channels? 

Also does anyone know how much lighter it was then the aluminium phone dial?
What about compared to the 951S forged wheel? In other words what is the
lightest factory alloy for the 951!

I just go down to my local foreign/domestic/but-not-porsche auto parts
place and buy a standard size battery (I believe it's a size 58 or something
like that).  It fits into the left battery box sideways, so the ground
terminal is inside the box and the positive terminal is outside.  The vertical
dimension is the critical one - it just barely fits into the box.  In fact,
I put one of those acid neutralizer felt washers on the ground terminal last
time I got a new battery and it didn't have enough clearance for the terminal
to fit.  There's about an inch free play in the horizontal dimension - I have
a couple of wooden blocks to keep it from moving around (in additional to
the stock metal strap).  Costs about $50.

I've seen a pair of gel batteries specially made to fit into the boxes of
the pre-74 911's advertised in the back of on of the relevant magazines -
does anyone know if the Optima 800 battery (a stand-alone gel battery advertised
elsewhere, e.g.  Automechanika) will fit in the box in a similar fashion to
the above?  The price per battery it the same (around $100), so I'd rather go
with the single if it fits.

P-Netters,

Well, the general consensus about non-Fuchs alloys is
that they're no good. A couple more questions, and I
promise I'll let it rest.

Admittedly, they're not as strong - but I can't believe
they're "killer wheels" that are going to break in the
middle of a turn and convert me and machine into Porsche
pudding. If they fail when (if) I hit someting hard, I
probably wouldn't be leaving the scene of the accident 
anyway. The only forseeable scary scenerio would be if
I hit a pothole and the rim broke off causing me to lose
control. I chipped a big chunk out of a rim on a Mahle 
alloy wheel that way, but the tire stayed inflated.

A lot of people must buy these wheels, and I've never 
heard any complaints - just apocryphal stories and one
Anderson photograph. If they're really dangerous or won't
stay balanced, or leak air I'd like to know. If, on the
other hand, they are as safe as cast cookie cutters and
the same or less weight why shouldn't they be an 
alternative?

So how much is prejudice and how much is real concern?
If safety was the only issue, we'd all be driving Buick
station wagons.

Salutations;

I've got a problem with a 914 2.0 4 cylinder head off my '76.
#1 cylinder had an intake valve seat fall out of the bore.
No apparent damage was suffered other than the seat hanging in the head.

I took the head to a shop for repair and when I got it back the 
valve with the repair was set into the head ~0.50" deeper than the
other valve.  This makes the valve stems uneven in length, visually.
The repair set me back $65...and i thought the results should be 'right'
at that price...
It was claimed that the head was serviced by a reputable VW head repair
shop.  Seems that an experienced shop would recognize the consequence
of altering the combustion chamber volume and installed spring height
this has caused.

In looking thru the "secrets...circle" book and vw overhaul books,
I cant find a spec for the stem length (i'll check the fact mans tonite).
I'm sure the head can be fixed, but the costs are mounting and i want
to do it RIGHT.  I'm no turkey..but im sure there are some in this town now.

Here's the question since I cant reach my mechanic friend till next week:
Is an unequal valve stem length bad?

Subject: Fact or Fiction?

Here something I'd like some opinions about.

An article in "EuroSport Car" magazine entitled "Cross 
Culture - Tuning your European car for American use" 
suggests that European cars ignition settings are designed 
for wetter-colder climates and slower stop and go driving. 
It proposes increasing the spark plug cap to get better 
performance. 

Quoting here:
"While suitable for the conditions they were originally 
designed for, they may not be correct for the different 
driving styles common in America. Usually when driving in 
the U.S., poor throttle response, rough idle and decreased 
mileage can be reduced by increasing your spark plug caps 
over factory settings."

"These larger gaps will enable your engine to run much 
smoother with better mileage and noticeably more power."

Here are some examples given in the article:
  "If you tune up your vehicle often, i.e., change plugs: 
  Change spark plug gap (+) .006; Four percent improved gas 
  mileage, noticeable smoother operation. No change in power."

  "If you only tune up your vehicle when it runs badly: Change 
  spark plug gap (-) .004; Allows you an additional 5,000 
  miles between tune ups. Increase in full throttle power by 
  two-percent. Lose three-to-five percent mileage."

  "If you drive to achieve maximum power (full throttle): 
  Change spark plug cap (-) .010; Six percent improvement in 
  power at 4,000 rpm. Better starting with fouled plugs. Seven 
  percent loss in mileage when driving slowly. Decrease in 
  tune up frequency by 25 percent."

The article also discusses spark plug "indexing". In a nut 
shell it says you should install the plugs so that the open 
side of the electrode is facing the incoming fuel/air 
mixture. 

This all sounds a little suspicious to me, but then that's 
not saying much.

For the record the article was written by Dr. Christopher A. 
Jacobs, PH.D., E.E. who has written "The Doctor's Step-by-
Step Guide to Optimizing Your Ignition".

Any thoughts on these "tricks"(my term) or the book.

Has he ever had the rims repaired?  The nice thing about multi-piece
wheels is that if you ding one piece, you replace it and not the whole
wheel.  We've done that for the race car's HRE wheels.

Carroll Smith is of the opinion that the fasteners used by BBS to put

You need to *carefully* check that connecting rod, piston, and wrist pin

Send said head to H.G. Bieker Engineering. He'll fix it up *RIGHT*. There
are two (and only two) ways to do it: (1) Gene Berg's way - cut your own
valve seat from a length of chromoly tubing to the correct length, 
press into the head, do a valve job (hey, this worked *several* times for
VW dragster engines I've built...) *or* (2) remove seat from head,
weld up seat area, re-machine to correct depth, re-install seat. The
(2) way is about $100, the (1) way is about $40 if you can get Gene or
Gary Berg to do it for you and too damned expensive if anyone else anywhere
else does it, if you know what I'm saying.... Needless to say, Bieker does (2).

>Here's the question since I cant reach my mechanic friend till next week:
>Is an unequal valve stem length bad?

Yes. It has two problems. First, you now have interesting deformities in
your combustoin chamber which change the displacement hence compression for
that piston *and* give you edges that may retain heat and cause 
detonation/preignition/dieseling depening on how bad it is, not to
mention ruining the head in the process. Second, you have way hosed
up valve train geometry now, which will put extra strain on your rocker arm
and potentially cause galling of the shaft, *plus* will "shorten" the
available space for the pushrod, making it necessary to either cut the 
pushrod down or making it impossible to adjust the valves. Note that none
of these eventualities are very pleasant.

>Implications?

See above. 

BTW, only 2.0 heads are worth fixing. There are enough good 1.7/1.8 heads
out there that you can just chuck them and get another used one. 2.0 heads
new, minus all the hardware, are over $800 and used are over $200 most of 
the time. And most of the used ones need *some* repair work -- typically
cracked near the spark plug hole (another fix Bieker does really well)
or having stripped stud holes.

Kyle,
Sorry to hear that you're having problems with your 2.0l heads.
But, don't feel like you're in this alone. I've been having plenty of
problems with mine and from what I've been able to learn the 2.0
heads are notorious for dropping seats.

This price seems kind of low to me actually. If you want to get a better
idea of what a real good repair should cost try to contact FAT Perfor-
mance. Their number can be had from the back of any of the VW mags. I
don't have any affiliation with them. I just read lots of good things
about them and they didn't flinch when I started asking specifics about
my head with three studs instead of four(for some reason this fact
knocked everyone else I had talked to for a loop). To be truthful I
have spoken with them on several fact finding missions of my own, they
are very helpful and knowledgeable about dealing with the type IV's.
I think Stan has had more intimate experience with them, he may want
to comment on the quality of their work. Unfortunately, you really need
to get this installed height fixed if you have a difference of half an
inch(did I read that right?). It will probably adversely affect the
valvetrain geometry.

I can really sympathize with you on this respect. I learned the hard way
that there are some real turkeys here in New Orleans too!!! And if that
isn't bad enough there wasn't anybody else here in town to do the work.
I am also on a budget that didn't allow me the luxury of sending my
stuff to someone like FAT. So I wound up having to buy some tools and
doing the rebuild myself. And it has not been without event either.
Unless you have access to a friend's shop, I think you should consider
trying to get the money together and have the repair done again. BTW,
I was unable to find specs on installed height for the valves either
so if you find something, please forward it for future reference.

I hope I haven't completely discouraged you and I hope you get your     ek:
problems worked out. Good Luck Kyle!!

Hmm, this is going to be a bit contentions but here goes. IMHO
Split-Rims as these type of wheels are known in the UK are plain bad
news as a road wheel. They are pandering to the desire of looking like
a racer, where having a number of different sizes of centre section
allows you to play with offset/width et all. It also allows you to
only replace the outer rim edge if you kerb the thing. I don't think
anyone on the really uses the ability to disassemble the wheel to fit a
tyre, 'cos it takes longer than doing a 930 plug chop in the middle
of winter.

Friends of mine who have used these wheels (yes BBS), have had all
sorts of problems. Ranging from leakage around the 'O' ring where the
edge butts to the centre section to catastrophic failure when a number
of the bolts have sheared. Road salt is a real killer here, esp. when
it gets to work on the threads of the Allen bolts. They have all given
up now and gone back to one piece rims. I would guess that if you want
the look on a road car, you should go for the Audi approach and have a
purpose built dress one piece casting with the 'bolts' doing nothing
but looking pretty tapped into the edge of the rim.

My advice would be to cut one meter diameter circles out of plate
glass, for the remaining rims, mount it on top, and use as coffee
tables.

Those little Porsche Spec. books available from
Performance Products and other sources for a few
bucks have a wealth of information as far as 
specifications and measurements. Its like having a 
pocket sized shop manual. They show virtually all engine
measurements and wear limits.

The book probably gives acceptible limits for valve stem
height and would be excellent ammunition to either get
your money back or have the shop do the job right (I don't
think I would give them another chance)

There is also a really neat little tool that you can
get that fits down over the valve stem and spring and
has a scribed line for the correct assembled valve spring
height for your car, to help you determine the correct 
number of shims. I'm not sure if they come in sizes for
914's but they are well worth the $35 or $40 if you can 
find one. 

Good luck,

Cast fuchs:

These wheels have been known to fail due to CORNERING loads alone in
AutoCross.  The cornering loads creade shear stresses in the webbing
which initiate mode III crack growth leading to catestrophic failure,
i.e. the centers HAVE been known to rip out of the center.

Remember one thing:  Cast aluminum (especially gravity cast) is
non-ductile, i.e. brittle and generally fails via crack growth and
consolidation initiated from surface imprefections.  Cast materials
have almost NO ductility, which is why engine blocks crack and not
bend.  Blah Blah Blah......

Forged materials start out as cast then have their surfaced deformed
by hot working so that work hardening occurs on the surface and
throughout the structure.  In this way cracks are closed durring
deformation and surface toughness AND hardness are both improved.
Fatigue, which is a crack-initited failure mode is also nipped in the
bud as surfaces on forged materials are in a state of compression due to
deformation, which acts to close cracks.  Also, lattice structures are
irregular surpressing crack growth.

Pressure cast wheels have an inherently smooth surface and
fall somewhere in between.

Yes, I have had one a year.

I ordered it sight-unseen as soon as I saw the 1st ad in C&D. (I knew of his
reputation and have a G-analyst, so I expected the Valentine 1 would be very
good.)

It didn't come for about 5 months  -- immediately the orders got all
backlogged.  (When they told me there was a 3 month wait, I asked if it was
vaporware and was assurred that it wasn't -- simply that they were receiving
many, many orders more than could be filled.)

After the 3 months dragged on to 4, I even called them and spoke to Valentine
himself about the delay. He told me that QA on these microparts is VERY hard.

Finally it arrived.

It definitely works.  There are 2 antennas builtin (forward and behind) so it
finds the badguys whereever they are.  Of course, I can't attest to the
X/K/Xa, etc stuff which C&D tested, but I assume that everything functions
properly. The arrows are neat: they light forward, backwards, or sideways to
indicate where the badguy is. The device is appreciably larger than my old
Passport, so it is more intrusive. It only runs from the car's power supply --
no built-in battery.

Recent reviews rave about it. I hear that there are still very long leadtimes.


Complaints: none. I love it.

Stefan-

>What's a GTS and how do you get 1160 HP out of it?
>How do you control it on the street.

Porsche inroduced the first major engine upgrade for the 928 since 1987
with the 1993 928 GTS.  The stroke was increased to give it about 5.4 L
displacement and the main bearing placement is different.  The engine I
have is actually a factory new casting, but of the older S4 design.  I
then modified it so that it is more similar to the GTS engine than the old
S4.  I designed a new crankshaft that has 1 cm more stroke than the S4 did,
for about 5.698 L, and machined it out of vacuum degassed 4340 billet and
nitrided it.  New conrods were machined out of a similar material and 
shorter forged pistons lower compression ratio to 9.2:1.  Stronger head
and crankcase studs were added and I'll o-ring the heads before running
at full power.  A dry sump system takes care of lubrication.  Add
ceramic, low friction and oil shedding coatings to the various components,
do a little detail work on some stress raisers in the castings, plumb a 
reverse flow cooling system in and, simple as that, you have a fantastically
strong race-ready block that can handle the stress of over 1200 HP.

Then I add two Garrett turbos that can boost 30 psi each, massive intercoolers,
a custom neural net to detect detonation, a fully sequential fuel injection
system, two massive fuel pumps, custom rails and injectors, and about a
zillion hours of development.  The result is the power source for my senior
mechanical engineering project at Rice University.  

Getting this to the ground is a task, so my group has designed a 3 diff
4WD system with Torsen style worm and spur gear limited slip units to 
apportion torque where it is needed.  A fly by wire throttle with built in 
traction control helps, as will ABS in stopping it.

If you have any specific questions, me or one of my group would be happy
to field them.  We would also welcome any comments from the super-high 
performance junkies out there.  If you have entered the realm of truly 
serious performance, or wish to, I'd like to hear what you would like to

One of the things he implied in the article is none of this will
do you any good unless you get a different ignition system first.
Look on the inside of the front cover and see who is trying to
sell what.  Why, it's Dr. Jacobs' company Jacobs Engineering
selling ingnition systems.  And making claims of huge HP gains
(over factory figures).

Something else just clicked as I was writing this.  In our local
PCA newsletter one of the local guys wrote an article about visiting
the Porsche factory.  He was describing watching an engineer do a
dyno test of a new 911 engine.  I don't remember the exact numbers but
the factory figure is 250hp and this engine was 264hp.  The tour guide
just smiled and said the published figure is a little conservative.

Actually, this is not even up to Mark Donahue's definition of "adequate
power", if I remember correctly. I believe that he defined it as being
able to spin the tires at any speed. I assume he came fairly close in
the 917-30, with roughly 1100 HP and 1600 (?) lb. 

1000 HP in a 928 doesn't sound like it even comes close. Of course it
would be fun to be the one to do the test driving to see if it had
"adequate power" or not.

In response to Bob Mohan's comprehensive list of questions...

>Sure, I have a few academic questions about your senior project.

>Is this Grad or Undergrad work?
I'm an undergraduate senior and will graduate in May.

>How long of a project is it? A group Project? Like how many?
The work I am doing in conjunction with Rice and five other rice
students will end in May.

>Who pays?  You or the school?
I have a small company that does automotive design work on a
contract basis.  Composites, computers, high perf stuff. My
partner and I are financing the entire project.

>Is money a constraint on your design?
We have been moderately successful, so when I set out to design
the best performing car in the world, I didn't have to worry 
about expense.  It ended up costing a small fortune, though
much less than what a major design house would spend on a
prototype of this quality.

>What are you doing to the drivetrain to handle 1200 HP?
>(or the chassis for that matter?)  Titanium Indycar 
>driveshafts, etc?
The drivetrain is a freshly designed 4WD system with a
variable torque split to all four wheels.  The main driveshafts
(there are two) are 3 inch diameter steel or 3.5 inch aluminum
with U-joints (angles are fixed with a max of 3 degrees).  The
halfshafts use Porsche CV joints and stub axles with custom
shafts (300ksi yield).  The chassis is a composite design that
I can't discuss in public.

>Is this going to be a dragster or will it handle turns, etc.?
The car has a mid-engined layout with room for four full size 
passengers (thanks to a 120 in. wheelbase and a forward design
where the driver's feet are just over the steering rack).  The
suspension has active spring and damper rates, as well as 
variable ride height.  It's a GT car with a top speed as high
as the driver is brave or the road is long.  Should pull a high
9 on street rubber, or run with the best at Le Mans.

>Do you have an aerodynamics team?
You're talking to him.  Two years of development with the bulk
of the analysis done on a radical program run on a YM-P.  If 
you want to know more you'll have to call me voice and I'll
have to fax you a non-disclosure agreement...
The results are a .17 Cd. Great care was taken to properly
locate the air intakes so as not to increase the drag of the
computer design.  I have seen so many low drag prototypes that
have no provisions for cooling without destroying the flow 
over the front of the car.  Just melted looking blobs or
impractical designs like the ford probe IV (the front wheels
do NOT turn and there is room for a radiator for a 8 horse
engine at best).  I've added an extensive active-aero system
as well.  Under braking the brake ducts open full, the Cd
goes up to .4 or so and the Cp moves rearward.

>How about a weight reduction tiger team?
The target was 3200 lbs with glass and a full interior, but the
chassis was so light, I haven't worried about it in the least.

>Are you doing appropriate brake and suspension upgrades?
See above on suspension.  The brakes are a new AP six-pot 
design with 14 in. rotors.  I'm working on ABS.

>Who gets the car when it's done?
ME.  I'll be selling it off (sob) after I make the rounds of 
the free press.  The entire car was designed with limited
production in mind, so I may build a few more depending on 
the market.  I have more interest than I can cope with now,
so maybe that won't be a problem.

I would like the opinion of the Porschephiles on quite a few
topics.  All the attributes of this car are tunable.  The 
throttle is fly-by-wire and the suspension can be set up
to mimic any kind of handling characteristics.  I'll have
to set all of these eventually and I want to give it the 
most driver-friendly persona possible.  As I get to 
specifics, I'll post.  Otherwise fire away in general.

One thing.  The mechanicals will be finished in May, and
the body, aero, interior and programming the May after that.
I've always hated advance hype about new automotive designs, 
so if we could keep this away from the almighty Press, my
life would be a little easier.

Thanks for the interest, and sorry for the long message-

The story Mark Donohue told in "The Unfair Advantage" was that when he
first went to look at the 917(/10?) at Weissach, he went out for a
test on the test track and afterwards the Porsche engineers asked him
if the car had enough power.  He said "No".  Weeks later after
improving the engine and another test they again asked him if there
was enough power and he said "No".  After some number of iterations of
this, they finally asked when there would be enough power and he said
that "there would be enough power when I can spin the tires at the end
of the main straight."  Evidently the engineers were amazed and
couldn't believe that he could possibly want that much power.

This led directly to the 917/30, I imagine.

Subject: Repainting a 911

Regarding Steve Chan's search for a good paint shop in the Bay
Area, I offered him the following opinion:

Dear Steve,

I was reading your synopsis of Bay Area paint shops
and it was all very interesting until I got to the
end. Where you said that you were going to paint
your Turbo black while it is currently (and originally, I
presume) Metallic Blue.

I can't emphasize enough to you what a GREAT MISTAKE you
will make if you alter the original color of your 911.
I have owned 911's for 10 years and I have looked at hundreds
for potential purchase. Nothing short of an obvious blown 
engine (or bad rust) brings down the price of a used 911 faster than
non-original paint. It suggests two things: (1) There was collision 
damage or it is hiding rust. (2) The owner does not respect the value
of the car and therefore probably doesn't take good care of it.
This last point may seem frivolous but people who change the color
of a 911 for aesthetic reasons without going to BARE METAL everywhere
and replacing the paint code plate inside the door jamb, are
not typically viewed as enthusiasts who really take good
care of their cars. I know this sounds judgemental but I have 
seen a strong correlation in my travels. There will, of course,
be the odd exception (they usually seem to be racers bound for the
track and don't care about market value).

If, on the other hand, you are returning the car to original color,
bravo for you. You can find all of its original attributes from 
Porsche Cars of North America in Reno as pointed out several
net-grams ago.

Again, please reconsider. A repainted 911 with one color outside and
another one tucked away somewhere looks like s**t and scares away
a fair number of potential buyers.  You are prepared to pay a lot
of money for this job and you want it done right. You will loose
what you are putting into it (and perhaps more) if you change the
color.

These are my opinions. Do what you like.

Posted for my better half:

HELP!!!
I have a 1987 944S that I think has a Gremlin in the electrical
system.  Yesterday as I left for work, I flipped my turnsignal
indicator on and instead of the usual rhythmic click I got one
flash then nothing.  I figured I had a burned out bulb and checked
that after I got to work.  The bulb wasn't burnt!  I fiddled around
with the light assembly for a couple minutes and tried again...it
now blinked!  I started the car to go home...no signal again.  I
messed around with it at home and it started to work again!!!.
This morning it didn't work again...however about half way to work
it started blinking erratically.  This afternoon it did the same
thing.  I tried contact cleaner on the wiring harness, the bulb and
the contact point.  To sum up...the bulb blinks correctly when the
engine is turned to accessary, blinks slower than it should when
the engine is running...and doesn't blink when the car is cold. I
hope someone has an answer other than many hours at the shop! :-)

I guess I neglected to give a little history about this car.  It 
is a theft recovery 911SC.  The second owner decided to throw a 
turbo body (all OEM parts, including the wheels) on it with a 
non-porsche color.  Being a neophyte at the time, I bought the
car.  Hey, it looked good! 

Now, given the above information, will the resale value of my car be 
affected by a different color paint job?  I'm tending to think not.
But please let me know if I am wrong.

  Well, I've been looking at lots of 911s over the past few months
(23 cars, I have a log book) and personally, I wouldn't buy a 911 if
I could tell it had been painted. So, the paint job should DEFINITELY
not change color, and should be detailed enough so that even the
inside of the door jambs (and other such places) have been finished
so as not to reveal painting (either by color shade or paint ridge).
For a complete repaint, the cars I've seen have knocked $2000 to
$3000 off of what the car would have sold for. Apparently, the 911
buying public feels the same way, just ask any pre-owned Porsche
dealer. 

  So, Stephan, I know you didn't ask for this opinion, but I'll give
it anyway for the sake of this discussion. If the car NEEDS repainted
due to rock chips, fading, vandalism, damage repair, etc. I would say
go ahead and have the car repainted THE SAME COLOR. That way it won't 
cost you the amount of the paint job PLUS lost resale value.

  Personally, I think black is a good color for concours but it shows
dirt and scratches for too easily for street or track use. Maybe that's
why it's a good color for concours, flaws are easy to spot with the
naked eye.

Think about it. Ask some other people for their opinions. You might
just change your mind.

Subject:  Early 911

I am still looking at buying an early ('69-'73 ) 911.  I am having a difficult
time locating an affordable 911S and am now looking at an E or T.  

I was wondering which of the T models is the fastest and most reliable.  
Should I go with the carbureted version or CIS?  

How much slower 0 to 60 is say a '73 911E than a '73 911S?

What were the major problems with the early 911's?

I already know that I will have to replace the seats.  I rode in a '73 911E 
and the seats were VERY uncomfortable.  Will the later (after '74) 911 seats
bolt into a pre-74 911 without any modifications?

Do any of the the 911T's have 0 to 60 times under 8.0 seconds?  I'm talking 
stock.

Thanks
Steve

Dave,
I have just one question. When do tickets go on sale for flight 928 GTS
non-stop from Rice U. to Anywhere U.S.A.??!!

Concerning no-limits automobiles: I've always thought it would be nice
to have a superior performing car for city/highway driving. One that
can get forty or fifty miles per gallon while embarrassing Corvettes,
Vipers, etc. at the stop light, and that you can drive to your local
airport, extend your wings and rudder, do a quick flight check and
refuel for your pleasant solitary commute home across the lake. Com-
pletely free from the trials and tribulations of being in bumper to
bumper traffic for hours.
Now, can anyone help me address this letter to Santa Claus?

You will probably have to threaten a lawsuit to get the real parts, and yes
there is a signifigant difference, unless you intend to sell the car as soon
as it is repaired, force them to use the OEM parts. Legally you can. Taking
the automobile to a Porsche dealer is a good suggestion. Change insurance to
USAA (if possible), they are a little more but they pay rapidly and don't 
try to stick you with non OEM parts. Good luck in this battle because it will

I can't totally disagree with this.  But, then again, there is something 
frivolous about a Porsche and I love them none the less.  This prototype
was meant as an exercise in every leading edge automotive field possible.
It turned out that if I applied the latest technology in engine management,
I could get over 1000 HP with relative ease and tractability.  Keeping it
under safe control has turned out to be a worthy challenge.

You might be interested to know that this engine was not only designed with
maximum power in mind.  At light part throttle conditions it will go into a
lean burn mode (though not as radical as the Honda system), and runs in 
closed loop using info from two lambda sensors.  It also uses a new quick
light catalytic converter (a non-heated system).  We had two constraints on
the maximum output of the car, 1) we wanted it to come in under the gas
guzzler limits, and 2) we want it to be able to pass 1995 CA emissions 
regulations.  With the level of control that our computer system gives us, 
it looks like this will be possible.  The low low low Cd helps on the 
highway cycle and brings us in well under the wire.

Environmental responsibility aside, there is something undeniably exciting,
even addictive, about being traction limited all the way up to 140 MPH.

I, too, would love to see the racing formulas get more relevant to the
passenger car.  Spending millions on optimizing the aerodynamics of a 
car that runs 1-2" off the ground really does seem frivolous.
I guess that did bring us the moving ground plane wind tunnel, but I have
yet to see a production design that put any real emphasis on aerodynamics.

Give the above, it probably won't matter. *BUT* I **HIGHLY** recomment 
that you "do it right" and strip the body (i.e. take everything off the car, 
not spray with Paint-Be-Gone) so that a *good* job can be done.
This means engine compartment, front storage compartment, all the
doors/lids/whatever, under the carpet inside the car, etc.

If there's anything still showing original color that's casually visible, you 
won't be happy, and you *won't* be able to sell it very easily. 
Cars with that sort of history are best sold to people who want to
tinker with them, which already means you won't get top dollar. But
then, if it's a theft recovery, presumably you didn't *pay* top
dollar so it doesn't matter...

Just be sure you're painting it because you *want it to be that color*
not because you think it will help the value, and spray away!

I have a 77 911S which I experience the same sort of click.  Mine
does not make a noise that I noticed, but the pedal definitely hits
some sort of a wall when pressed hard almost as if the pedal were
bottomed out, yet there is still travel left.  I had the master
cylinder replaced and that did not solve the "problem".  My mechanic
says he has noticed this in other cars but has no further
suggestions.  I recently put S front calipers (aluminum) on my
car.  This made the "problem" more noticeable!  What's going on
here?  Are the brakes safe?  I have only needed to use the brakes
that hard at a couple of Mid-Ohio schools I went to.  There is
still travel/braking after this point, however much more pedal
effort is required.  Am I possibly going past some point where
the power brake booster is no longer providing assist?  The wall
definitely feels mechanical in nature.  Thanks for any help.

Subject: Exhaust Plugs??

I have another question someone may be able to help with...

On a 928 S4 head there are four threaded plugs directly below each
exhaust port.  When the plug is removed, there is a small (about 1.5mm)
hole through to the exhaust port visible.  I can think of no possible
reason for this, except that it is a great place to mount a thermocouple.
Perhaps it is there for a hookup to some testing equipment?  Does anyone
have a clue?

I want drill this area through to the water jacket and plumb in the reverse

silly little hole.  Then the cooling flow can be injected directly between

I find all this State Farm bashing to be quite interesting. In all of
my dealings with them, I have had *zero* problems, including about a
$14k repair to my 911 after I was rear-ended. Factory parts, some
serious time on an alignment rack, weight checking the car, all
the stuff you need to do to make a 911 *perfect* in collision repair.
They paid, didn't ask questions, didn't complain.

And I didn't have to threaten, call my lawyer, or anything. I just explained
that this was how it was going to be, took the car to the shop I knew
had the 911 heavy collision experience needed, and left town for about
six weeks. Lots of FAXes went back and forth, some photos got FedExed, 
and I had a few people stop by to check progress for me, but when I
returned, I was completely satisfied except for the way they had tinted
my back glass (since it popped off the Targa bar, I figured this was a great 
time to get it done *RIGHT*, and someone blew that. Sigh.).

State Farm came by, inspected the car, inspected the receipts of the stuff
used to fix it, and droppd of the check. No further problems.

There was a number of articles in different magazines (UK) that interviewed

finish for Carrera RS wheels for example. He said 1) Porsche wheels are the
absolute "dogs bollocks", the best wheel *anybody* makes and 2) BBS are useless 
 - they actually have to be sent back to BBS in germant to be re-built properly 
(obviously the split-rim type) because of the sealing between sections etc.

Just out of interest - just why would he want to spin the wheels on the

When I bought my '73 model it came with SC (or Turbo. i'm not sure) highback

Subject: '73 911S Available

An opportunity has come up locally to purchase a '73 
911S and I would like opinions about this.  As I just 
learned of this and the car is fairly far away from me, 
I have not yet seen it.  The car has 91K miles on it, 
has the 2.4l engine and is on its 4th owner (who seems 
quite knowledgeable about it).  I forgot to ask if it 
has a 4-speed or 5-speed transmission.  All maintenance 
records are said to exist, it is said to run well and 
look good, having been repainted its original metallic 
blue about four years ago.  The mechanic who allegedly 
has worked on it is well known in this area as one of 
the best P-car mechanics.  The owner is willing to 
listen to offers of $15K.

My question then; is this car worth giving serious 
attention to as a purchase?  In this part of the world 
the galvanized bodies of newer Porches is an important 
consideration.  Were the '73 911S models galvanized or 
did that come a little later?  Opinions would be 
appreciated.

David:

I wish you all the very best of luck with the 928 GTS project you described
on Porschephiles. When it was time for me to pick a school for graduate studies,
I narrowed it down to U of Washington and Rice. It went with the UW, but now I
wonder if my choice was right...

I don't know enough about the level of performance you're talking about.
But it seems to me that your car might well have a top speed of 350mph.
On the other hand, at that speed, gas mileage is probably in the range of 1-2mpg
With a tank capacity of 20 gallons, that gives you a range of 30 miles, or a
time between refueling stops of 5 minutes. Am I approximately right with these
numbers?
Maybe you already thought about this, but a 350mph, it should be possible to
refuel the car from the air by tanker plane. With the number of gas stations
dwindling, is this the next wave in fuel marketing?
In a more serious vein, with all your computer power in the design of this car,
have you figured out at what speed the car is going to be most fuel efficient?
Factoring in an average time of 5 minutes per refuleing stop, at what speed then
can I travel across the country in your 928GTS?

Thanks for pushing the limits. Maybe some of your technology will come down to
street cars.

The answer's above. Basically the guy based in the London (UK) area refinshes wheels. 
He actually does work for Porsche G.B. The setup is basically this.

1. He removes the old protective finishes e.g laquer in a chemical bath.

2. He sets the wheel on a CNC lathe and takes a few microns of metal off
    ( and all of the corrosion with it).

3. He repaints as per original or customer instructions.

The net result is basically amazing. I would say the wheels
are actually BETTER than the originals (Having seen 2 931s at
the UK Concours  one with orignal "pampered, only used at concours"
wheels and second with knackered and then re-finished wheels
the re-finished had a noticably better polish to them).

He charges about 40-50 GBP per wheel (rim only, more if you want tyres
taking off and putting back on).

There must be somewhere in the states that does this.

slightly off.  power required goes as velocity cubed.  mileage goes down as
velocity squared.

assume you get 30 mpg at 60 mph in your 928gts, and that it uses 300 hp to go
170 mph.

top speed is now 170*(1000/300)^(1/3) -> 254.

mileage is 30*(60/254)^2 -> 1.7 mpg.

on the other hand, at the more practical speed of 120 mph (remember the highways
of the future we kept hearing about in the 60's?), mileage would be a cool 7.5 mpg,
or 1.25 hours worth.

the obvious optimization problem is left as an exercise to the reader..

I'd like to thank everyone that's sent me mail so far.  I've got a couple
of new ideas to try.  Here's what we did yesterday:  we removed the light
assembly (which is stamped VW BTW...) and cleaned all of the bulbs and
sockets with contact cleaner.  This made the turn signals work, but the
rear parking lights stopped working!  That is, they didn't work unless
you pounded the lense or slammed the drivers door.  I also noticed that
the battery voltage was only 11.75 volts (engine off).  It got to the
point that the running light would not work if it was cold unless I
tapped it very lightly with my finger, then it would remain lit no
matter how much I wiggled it.  I replaced both running lights and they
seem to be working fine.

As of this morning the turn signal isn't working again.  I'm going to
pick up a new relay this afternoon.

Ditto.  I've had mine for ~6 months now (backorder was 5 months), and am
waiting for my wideband upgrade letter...the offer to upgrade previous
owners for little more than shipping costs is a sign of good customer-focus.

In addition to the directional arrows, it counts "engagements" (up to 9),

80%+ in "All Bogies" mode, but I'm in NJ...home to tons of X-band security
systems and cars using radar detetors to keep their Insurance rates down.  
Detection of other radar detectors shows up as either X or K, sometimes both.

On the power cord, I have the optional remote display, which can be
mounted anywhere between the unit and its power.  I intended to mount it
near the speedo, but the "stock" configuration (tip of the cigarette
lighter power plug) works well and serves the primary purpose of getting
the display off the detector where "someone following you" can see it.
Custom cabling is made easy - it uses standard telephone wire & jacks.

On the down side, a friend who had one last winter says that the suction
cups don't hold onto his windshield as well as his Escort did when it's
"cold" (He's in the Midwest: "cold" = <10F??).  The price shouldn't be too
much of a downer for this group - roughly $300, plus $50 for the remote kit.

The goal is to reach 300 mph on the short course at Bonneville.  We should
have an extra 175 HP leaft over at that speed to burn in downforce and 
acceleration.

>On the other hand, at that speed, gas mileage is probably in the range of

We have two fuel cells each holding over 16 gallons.  The economy at top 
speed should be over 2.4 mi/g thanks to the low Cd.

>In a more serious vein, with all your computer power in the design of this car,
>have you figured out at what speed the car is going to be most fuel efficient?

Maximum efficiency is achieved at a cruising speed of 75 mph.  For fear of
being laughed off Porschephiles, I won't print our estimates.  But the 
low Cd again helps in that only 60% as much HP will be needed to propel our
prototype to this speed as compared to the 928.  This figure also accounts for
the friction in the full time 4WD system.

Now wouldn't it be nice to say "but, officer, that WAS the responsible speed
to be driving at!"

Seriously, if Detroit ever gets its act together and produces low drag, low
consumption autos, the average maximumally efficient cruising speed will rise
from 50 to maybe 70 mph.  Sounds like a great reason to raise speed limits 
to me.

Subject: 944 belt info solicited


Porschephiles,

I have been searching the archives and reading recent posts concerning the
cam and balance shaft belts on 944's.  There have been a couple of tantalizing
bits if information which lead me to the following questions concerning the
issue of 'replacing your own:'

1.  '87 and later models have a built-in tensioning device for the cam belt
which makes it possible to replace this belt without the Porsche tensioning
gage.  This should have two additional benefits.  First, since the tensioning
device should make up for at least some of the thermal expansion of the engine
block shoudn't the belt last longer?  And second, it seems that it should be
unnecessary to retension the belt following a break-in period (T or F?).

2.  The balance shaft belt still requires some method for achieving the
correct tension.  However, it looks like the geometry of this belt should
make for a reduced effect from the block's thermal expansion.  Also, the
function of this belt is less critical than the cam belt (barring a failure
which could induce a subsequent problem with the cam belt).  Therefore, it
seems to me that it ought to be possible to use some 'eye-balling' method
to adjust the balance shaft belt.  In fact, some of the posts have
suggested such a possibility.

I am particularly interested in the second question and would appreciate
any comments, suggestions, and (particularly) techniques from anyone out
there with appropriate knowledge.

Many thanks..

instead of the hit-rr.  When my wife almost broke the front wheel off her
front-wheel-drive probe last winter they whined and stalled and it took 
almost 6 weeks to get the car done.  We had to pay for most of the rental
car and for a lot of the work.  I had to beg and threaten for 5 weeks for this. 
The bottom line is they are the epitamy of insurance company greed.

Subject: Re: Turnsignal problem on 87 944S


Hi, 

I've had the same problem.

The answer: Change the turn-signal RELAY (about 12$Cdn).

The explanation: The soldering cracks after about 5 years.
                 -When it gets cold the cracks expand as the 
                 soldered material shrinks.
                 -When it gets hot the cracks close up as the 
                 soldered material expands.

Warning: This problem is an early indicator of
         similar problems with other relays
         in that beautiful box of "Bosch" components...
         But that's another story!

the Porsche factory.  He was describing watching an engineer do a
dyno test of a new 911 engine.  I don't remember the exact numbers but
the factory figure is 250hp and this engine was 264hp.  The tour guide
just smiled and said the published figure is a little conservative.

I came to talk with the engineer doing the test and one of the things he said
was that engines with too much or not enough power were taken off the
production line, legal implications beeing one of the reasons.

False. The built-in tensioner replaces the special tool in the tensioning
process, but the tensioning process is still manual, not automatic.
A pair of nuts are loosened, and a spring which is internal to the
tensioner then establishes the proper tension, and the nuts are retightened.
This will not alter the effect of thermal expansion, nor does it
eliminate the need for periodic retensioning, including the one after
the break-in period.

In concept this is true. The balance belt is less highly stressed, and 
the consequences of breakage are less, unless the broken balance belt
gets caught in the cam belt and causes it to break. However, you are
placing a rather large wager on the table (several $K), based on a
rather limited set of data. The fact that one or a few balance belts
have failed without taking the cam belt along for the ride isn't much
to go on, in my opinion. I would suggest that you let the cam belt
adjust itself, and perhaps use a heuristic method for the balance belt
to cover a few hundred miles until you can get the balance belt
adjusted with the tool (borrowed, done by dealer, etc.), but don't
bet the farm on a heuristic method alone.

No, but I do have the carbs.  A set of dual Weber 40IDA's, complete with

All Porsche cars were galvanized starting with 1976 model year.

For the 73S, the answer is it may be galvanized.

My 1972 911T Targa was completely galvanized.  I know because I personally
stripped the car down to bare metal.  Doors, doorposts, lockposts,  fenders, 
rear quarter sections, rocker panels and front hood, were galvanized.  

Even the gas cap lid and the headlight buckets were galvanized.  

The rear lid had been replaced with a factory non-galvanized version,
so I don't know if the car shipped with a galvanized one.

From various sheet metal purchases, I acquired a normal 72 front bumper that
was galvanized but a front "S" spoiler that was not galvanized.
Again verified by stripping to bare metal.

I understand there was a limit on the quantity of Thyssen (sp?) galvanized 
steel that Porsche could buy.  So galvanized steel was selectively used until
1976 when Porsche could get enough for all cars.

For example, the 911 floor pan should be galvanized on all non Karmann 911's 
after mid - 1970.

Here's some speculation, based on my very limited data.

  The best candidate for a galvanized car pre-1976 would be a 
  Targa assembled in the Porsche factory.

  Targas, because any structural rust weakens an initially weaker body
  than the coupe, and I know that galvanized Targa rear quarter panels existed
  in 1972.

  "Porsche assembled" bodies because the Porsche factory would not
  burden the Karmann factory with any production problems that resulted from 
  the gradual changeover to galvanized metal.

  The Porsche/Karmann origin can be determined by the paint tag on the
  door hinge post or the VIN number.

Every Porsche engine was a significant improvement over it's predecessor --
without exception. So comparing a 2.7 to a 2.4 (particularly around
the time the 2.7 was introduced) would only lead to glowing reviews.
*BUT* with the 2.7, there were some significant problems as well.

>I have read several discussions on this net regarding the low life expectancy

Actually, I'd say it may be optimistic. *BELIEVE IT!!!* We're not
making this stuff up. Several of us (myself included) have even
been bit by this sucker.

>Also, I've heard about the problems with overheating and the cylinder head 
>studs pulling out.  How common were these problems on the 2.7l engine.

That's *WHY* you get the rebuild at 50-70K. It's not that the nuts fall
off the con rods, or the main crank journals get square -- it's that
2.7 was more engine that you can reliably put on that wonderful
old magnesium case. It was overkill for a 2.0 or 2.2; it was still
measurably over-engineered for a 2.4. But just NOT up to the task for
the 2.7. 

Oh, for a race engine, it's still great -- but you get to rebuild them all 
the time anyway. But for the street, don't plan on getting more than 70K
miles. In fact, if you haven't sold it by 50K miles, start counting your pennies 
for that rebuild... You may need it any day.

Once it's rebuilt, you can relax for a good while. If you use a full set of 
Dilavar studs, new pistons and cylinders, and do everything else "right"
you'll probably get 100k miles out of it. Maybe more.

But not on a stock 2.7. And a rebuilt 2.7? Yeah, right. Who did the rebuild.
When. Using what for parts. If you didn't do it, and don't intimately
know who did, don't trust it. It's just another core engine waiting to 
be rebuilt...

Chris,
  Did you see the movie "Predator"? I borrowed "Old Faithful", the
hip mounted air powered Gatling Gun from Arnold. He kept it as a
souvenier after the movie was finished. I believe it used 60 caliber
rounds, but it doesn't matter. I blew the sh*t out of the aluminum
alloy intercooler, the stainless steel braided dry oil sump lines, and
the fuel lines. 
  So, both turbos locked up, the nitrous kept pumping until the 
fuel ran out, and then exploded, driving all 8 of the Carbon Fiber-
Kevlar coated Carillo rods out the bottom. 3 of the 16 Splitfire 
spark plugs (twin plug heads) stripped all their threads and came 
firing back at me. I took one in the left shoulder ( the gun is 
right hip mounted if you remember the movie ) and the other two 
went into the cinder block dyno room wall. The oil from the 32
quart sump caught on fire and singed my mustache (talk about getting
flamed!), I didn't know synthetics would burn like that! All in all
I figure this automotive design crap is dangerous business, so I'm
throwing in the towel, no more prototyping for me. I don't want to 
lose my VirtuaRacing shifting arm to some silly engine performance
test.


Hope you enjoyed it!!

Did the review mention the outside air temp?  It makes a big difference
on my engine temp at an auto-x.  Also, a new engine will run cooler,
less dirt to impead heat transfer.

The overheating may be reduced by going to an 11 (instead of 5(?)) blade
fan and removing the thermal reactors ('75-'77).

From what I've read/heard, the best of the lot is the '74 (no smog
pump, thermal reactors, etc.).  Unfortunately, it's the best of a 
bad lot.

Before buying a 911, read Anderson's book: "The 911 Performance Handbook."

It's the best $20 you will ever spend on a 911.

I think you're much better off spending another $5k and getting an 'sc.

I have heard that the 2.7 is a nice engine to drive, when they are running.

Good call, could indeed be the culprit.  If so, relays and switches are
often repairable.  If it's a cracked solder joint, reflowing the solder
may be all that's required.  Pull the cover off the relay and hunt.

I had a similar problem last winter with my rear window defroster switch.
A real pain to get out, and then to add insult to injury, the replacement
cost was in the $30 range.  So I opened it up, got a little clever with
the soldering iron (as much as that might be possible) and saved myself
some money.

With respect to the original problem, another thing I would check is
battery voltage.  Make sure you have no less than 12.6 volts when running
the car.  You'll obviously need a digital meter for same, but the accuracy
can be important.

I have a 1987 Carrera cab (fact. turbo option). The motor has 44k miles
but is strong as confirmed by recent leak-down and compression test.
I would like to get more performance at a reasonable price. Since the
car is not used on the track (I would need  roll bar installed for PCA
events) it would be great to get some added power in the low-end of
the rpm range.
   My local shop, Exclusive Motorcars in Montcair,NJ, showed me a product
by AutoThority which seems very good. It is an intake and chip replacement
which developes significant torque improvements in the 2200-4200rpm range.
I'll skip the full spreadsheet of test results (which I frankly don't
understand anyway) and summarize below:
            
           @2300 rpm: torque 154.9lbs(w/o mod)-173.7lbs(with)

PEAK PERF  @6100 rpm: torgue 186.8lbs(w/o mod) - 202.3 (with)

                      hp 217.o (w/o mod)- 235.0 (with)

The motor which was used was a 1987 carrera (mileage unknown). All results
conform to Standard Corrected Data for 29.92 inches Hg. 60 degrees F 
dry air.
   The cost for all of this was around $2000 installed. Exclusive is very
confident about the results. They were very negative on chip replacements
before this particular set-up.
   I would really like to hear what you think of the above. I'm new to
Porschepiles and am not sure if this is an old topic so please bear

Subject: Re: Turnsignal problem on 87 944S

Hi, 

I've had the same problem.

The answer: Change the turn-signal RELAY (about 12$Cdn).

The explanation: The soldering cracks after about 5 years.
                 -When it gets cold the cracks expand as the 
                 soldered material shrinks.
                 -When it gets hot the cracks close up as the 
                 soldered material expands.

Warning: This problem is an early indicator of
         similar problems with other relays
         in that beautiful box of "Bosch" components...
         But that's another story!

Subject: Broken rear factory sway bar mount on a 911

The rear right factory sway bar mount on my 1986 911 has sufford metal fatigue.
The clamp still has the bolts with the fixed nuts and some of the mount metal
attached. I was told by my local Porsche dealer that this is a common problem.
Since I need to get this repaired, I was considering using the Weltmeister mount
kit that is made for cars that did not have a factory sway bar. This kit mounts
to the torsion bar housing. The alternative is to weld an OEM sway bar mount
on the floor pan (as it came from the factory).I would like to prevent this
problem in the future. The mount from Porsche is $60 plus welding cost. The
Weltmeister kit is about $75.

Would it be better to stay with the factory design?
Would it be better to use the Weltmeister kit?
Would it be better to use both?

I would appreciate comments from others that have delt with this problem.

Thank you!

 Need advice on how to "release" the light switch from the dashboard on 
 my 86' 911. I plan to change the wires leading to the light switch. To do
 this without twisting and reaching under the dash requires a removal of
 a "plate" securing the switch to the dashboard. Is there a particular trick
 to accomplish this. The "plate" has four pin holes; are these intended for a 
 prong-type of a tool or is the removal behind/under the dash only ???

Subject: Zenith Carbs

P-netters,
        In the process of rebuilding my 1970 911T, I have found that the 
carbs are so gummed up (the engine was idle for over 10 years), that I
am debating whether to rebuild them, buy new ones, or update to Webers.
        Trying to rebuild the carbs looks like a big job.  The flaps are
frozen to the barrels, the needles are stuck in their ports, etc.
        What are the consequences of updating?  I would like to remain
as original as possible.  I'm not too concerned about resale, as I intend
to keep this vehicle for some time, but I like the idea of retaining
the "as-shipped" status of the vehicle.
        Any suggestions appreciated.  Also, anyone with a couple of
re-buildable Zenith's, lets talk.

        Thanks,
                Tom

Yes its really possible.  However I do not know about these
franchise operations.  I have had several dings removed
painlessly this way.  The person who did the work was German. He
had worked in the BMW factory for years (so I was told), his job
there was to remove dings that happened in production without
the need to repaint.  I watched him work, there was no magic
involved, he'd just get behind the ding with a metal bar (he'd
bend up a bar to get in inaccessible areas) and slowly work it
out, he also tapped at the painted side with a HAMMER while he
was working the ding.  It was pretty amazing too watch, you
absolutly  can't tell where the ding was, and my car is black
(seemed like anyone could do it if you took the time to practice
a lot). This guy lived in Minnisota I think, and a couple of the
local dealerships would get him out here a couple times a year
(Boston area).  If you need it I can try to dig up the info at
home. Cost was $70 - $120 pretty cheap in my book.

Hope this helps

On late model cars with more flexible paint, it's a snap to 
"pop out" smallish dents with this odd spoon looking thing.
Works great. Like I said, on newish cars. On your beast, it
might crack or chip the paint. I dunno -- since you'd have to 
repain the area anyway to fix it, you might give it a try...

On the injectors, just about anyone is cheaper than Performance
Products. Let me see what price I can get for them in Houston.
I just checked, and list is $85.97, so I might be able to
take $10 of that, depending -- they're a special order item.
In the meantime, you might check Tweeks or Stoddard.

Subject: 944 cooling fan

Greetings;
I am having a small problem with the cooling fans on my '87 944S.
Once the car is up to temperature the fan relay tends to cycle on
and off alot.  Sometimes in a very rapid manner.  Also when the 
engine is turned off the fans cycle on and off rather than comming 
on for a while and then turning off.  I have tried a new fan relay
and this had no effect.  What determines the triggering of the fan
relay?  Is the problem likely to be the fan switch in the radiator
or something else?  The car runs fine and is not having any kind of
overheat problem, but the clicking is getting annoying.

Any help would be greatly appriciated.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 I think 2.7ltr engines are being given a bad rap..again. Maybe I am just
 lucky, but I have had very good luck with 2 different 2.7 ltr engines. My
 first was a 77 model and I sold it running strong with 110k miles. I
 currently own a 74 Carrera with over 120k miles and it is still has good
 compression and leak down. Neither engine was ever rebuilt, however both
 were routinely maintained throughout their life.

 Before you start hitting me with reply notes let me say I don't disagree
 with any of the technical things heard about the 2.7ltr engines, mag case
 problems, pulled studs etc. All engines have their quirks and the 2.7 is no
 exception. I think it is more a matter of numbers. Porsche made more 2.7's
 than any previous generation 911 engines and it is not surprising mechanics
 began to see them more often, there simply were more around. (another
 example of this phenomena has occurred with the 944). Had Porsche perceived
 the 2.7 as weaklings wouldn't they have made the switch to the 3.0 sooner.
  Remember the 3.0 case was available the entire time the 2.7 was in
 production. One could argue that Porsche produced the 2.7 for 4 years, twice
 as long as the production of either the 2.2 or the 2.4, which was an
 indication Porsche actually favored the engine.

 Let me conclude by saying the 2.7 is a great motor, worthy of the Porsche
 name. Certainly comparisons to other manufacturers and its racing success
 prove this point. I agree it may not be as capable as the king of longevity,
 the SC's 3.0, but my experience has proven they are good for over 100k. They
 simply are not the 50k mile time bombs some people like to describe them as.

Last week you wrote complaining about the smell and mentioned
a strong fuel odor.

Have you check that the fuel tank breather hoses and charcoal filter
canaster are hooked up properly.  This can really stink up the inside
of the car if the fuel tank air is not routed back to engine or vented to
the outside of the car.  

A good way to check for leaks is to use a match or lighter.

Hey gang, before i engage the distant salvage yards or pano part'ers
i'm asking here first.  My '73 914-4 needs this part: 111.953.535D
it is a 'contact ring' (made out of unobtainium) found on the upper
steering shaft.  It appears on fiche plate 4/3/2 pg. 2 item 23.
Uh, fiche # WET 613 420.  Just got off the phone with Stoddard; NLA!
With exception to the 1.8L 914, all 914-4 and 6 use this part and the
bearing ring that fits over it.

This bearing will cause a lot of noise in the steering when turning the
wheel (a kind of shiiiish sound)[no pun intended] and both 914's i have
suffer(ed) this.  I suspect other 914's do this too because the bearing
is of poor quality  marked with a star.  The lower bearing is
a fafnir of good quality and durability. IMHO!

I am willing to purchase the entire steering head including wheel and
centerpiece if the price is fair.  Just the part i need would be ok
but i also need the steering wheel centerpiece too, anyone know if
these are interchangeable across years?

I also am in need of a couple engine tin pieces for a 1976 914 2.0.
These are peculiar to the '75 and '76 years, but I might rather be
wanting a complete HX for '73 or so...its so tempting to stray from OEM
for that year (76).

Hi fellow Porsche'rs

I have a bit of a problem: I have a '76 Carrera Targa with an electric
windshield. It has electric threads like the rear window, but they're
invisible so it doesn't disturb the front "out-view" (sorry 'bout
my english :-). Now the problem is, that I've gotte a few small cracks
in the windshield, and my garage tells me, that I can't get another 
electric windshield again! That is, I can get one where the threads
only go about 1/4 up the windshield, but with the (very) cold danish
winthers it's nice to have an electric window all the way up.

The question comes now: Does ANYBODY know if and then where I can
get another fully electric windshield? (My garage got the last one
from Finland, but he says they don't make them any more)

Thanks in advance,

Same thing on my car - evidently it's gone through 2 sway bars this way.
I can't say which fix is better - but a year or so ago in European Car
there was an article about 911 suspensions that used a reinforced replacement
rear sway bar mount bracket.  These sold for $100 a pair.  I can go look up
the place that sells them for you if you want.

The primary cause of fatigue in these things is that people use them as
jack points to jack up the car...I always use the lower bolt on the torsion
bar mounting fixture.  Is there any net wisdom on the correct jack points on
an older 911?

Subject: 87' "phone Dial" wheel confusion

I have a 1986 944 Turbo with "Phone Dials", 7*16 front and 8*16 rear.Through
investigation I have come to the conclusion that I have 87' "Phone Dials". The
wheels are set deeper in the wheel well, because of the offset. The offset was
changed on the 87' year to accomodate ABS.So different phone dials were
manufactured because of this ABS update. I purchased the car used 2 months ago,
so whoever had the car before me changed them, or maybe the dealer did at time
of sale. What was standard equipment on this car? I ask this question because I
get different answers,some people say "phone dials" (with the right offset,not
the ones I have).Tom hiser at Porsche Cars Of North America, customer service
department in Reno states that 1986 944 Turbo's came across the assembly line
with 911 type forged wheels as standard equipment,a 951 prefix part # (Sorry ,I
don't know the proper name of these wheels).He also states that the wheels that
are on the car now (87 "Phone Dials") will not work properly on the car because
of the negative scrub radius, and it changes the wheelbase specs. What does this
term mean,and is it a problem using these wheels? Other people say that the
correct phone dials were standard .Did it change during the production year? Can
anyone help me on this? I have option code # 395, which is a forged wheels
option.(I guess the car once had the proper wheels).This is confusing.I have
heard that even "standard" equipment is listed on the option code list due to
assembly procedures and point of destination (different countries).Any help
would be great.

This is another (unfortunate) example of why it pays to be a pain in the
ass.  Several years ago I bought a low mileage 84 cabriolet from a local
Porsche dealer.  I later discovered a loud "clunking" noise in the rear
upon a sudden weight-shift (hard corner, tight turn up and into driveway,
etc.).  The dealer was reluctant to work on it, but because I had an extended
warranty they tried to find things they could repair and claim (and even
went so far as rebuilding the limited slip, as silly as it seemed to everyone
I talked to).  Eventually they gave up and told me to drive it and enjoy it! 
No one could pinpoint the problem.  I wrote letters to Bruce Anderson, sent
complaints to all the trade rags, and finally heard from PCNA who offered
financial help to convince the dealer to redouble efforts.  In all, it took
2 years to resolve.  A new trailing arm mysteriously fixed it (and no
one ever understood why).

Four wheel drive plus traction control is the best weapon there is against
a .4 coefficient of friction.  We'll be able to burn some aero efficiency
for downforce with the active aero system until about 260 or so when we'll
trim out all the aero surfaces for minimum drag.  With this kind of an
advantage, we should be able to hit 300 on the short course with ease.

Subject: 911 0-60 times

I am starting to shop for a 911 and am considering the following varieties:

	- 1972-1973 911E or 911S
	- 1978+ (hopefully 1980+) 911SC

I prefer the style/approach of the E/S, but the SC has its torque lower in its
rev range and, reportedly, a much longer life between overhauls.  I don't know
that the handling is that different between the two (great with a bit of 
understeer right up to the limit but mind-bogglingly scary, with a lot of 
spinning, immediately after).  Another factor that is important to me is a 
car's ability to accelerate throughout the speed range that I normally drive.  
It seems that 0-60 times best describe this.

I saw in an earlier article that the 1972/3 911E has a 5.8 sec 0-60 and that
the equivalent 'S' has a 6.0 0-60.  

Could someone please tell me what the 0-60 times are for the 1978/9 911SC 
or the 1980+ SC?

Thanks.

Replaced my hood shocks in January...cold = double torture.  
Two suggestions, however, for replacing the retainer clip on the left side:

i) Tie a piece of thread to the clip.  It makes retrieval for WHEN you
drop it easier, and helps (a little) in manouvering it around.

ii) Ask your wife?  My SO has very small hands, which should make the job
easier, and it is HER car after all.  This is only a theory...I knew
better to ask mine (she's cold on 80F days in July...forget January!).

iii) How much does Porsche actually want to do the job?  Yeah, its a
rediculously "easy" job, but so, so frustrating.  Desn't hurt to ask...

Next time, I would plan to try designing a special tool.  Maybe some sort
of flat stock with a few zigs & zags, with a good pushing surface that
you glue (secure) the piece onto...might be able to cut one from
something like a putty knife?

Subject: rebuilding an engine



I have some generic questions about engine rebuilding I hope you folks can
help with.  A friend and I will soon be rebuilding a VW engine which will be
put into a 356 while the original motor gets "unseized"

The VW for the transplant has been hot-rod'ed with a bigger bore (1835cc, I
think) and some head and cam work.  I'm not sure how it was treated by the
previous owner.  While the engine runs now (barely), we're re-building it
primarily to get some experience before tackling "the real thing"

My questions are:

1)  What components need to be replaced during a rebuild?  I know things
like rings, gaskets, and bearing should be replaced, as well as things that
don't measure to spec, but what about things like cranks and rods?  If the
tolerances on the crnak and rod measure okay, and there aren't any cracks
when xray'ed, does that mean they are okay?  How do you determine if it's
too fatigued, especially with a component that's been subjected to more
stress than designed for?

2)  Should valve guides be replaced?  How are they reamed after installation?

3)  How do you check a valve seat for wear?  The head is basically toast if 
they are worn, right?

4)  What sort of allowances do you need for the expansion of different
materials when assembling the engine?  For example, chro-mo case studs and
aluminum cylinder block?

5)  Any other gotchas we should think about?

Thanks,
Mike

[stuff deleted]

Michael,

The '86 951s *did* have positive offset wheels, which were not to 
appear on any further cars.  As of 1987 many (all?) Porsche models had 
negative offset wheels for ABS.

'86 phone dials are all cast aluminum colored; the forged wheel option 
had black-centered Fuchs in the more classic pattern.  Phone dials were 
standard.  In fact the wheels were shared with the 911 series.

The information you posted, which you obtained from several sources, is 
substantially correct.  If your car truly has negative offset wheels, 
then your track (not wheelbase) is wrong and the car's handling is 
compromised.  Also, if the option sticker shows forged wheels, then it 
also sounds like the previous owner sold them (they're worth $$$) and 
replaced them with *wrong* equipment.

Good luck on getting this resolved!

I assume this is a grease caps, which pushes into a bore in the end of
the spindle.  That being the case, the official factory method recommends
something like tire irons.  What I do is tap around the cap with a large
chisel, pushing it out.  Avoid scoring or otherwise marring the spindle's

Subject: Re: rebuilding an engine

First off, I'm only answering this because it's a VW engine going
into a 356. There *IS* a VW-specific mailing list, which I unfortunately
seem to have lost the address for... So: no more VW questions to
the list, OK?

Get a copy of two books: the HP Books volume called "How to Rebuild
Your Aircooled VW Engine" (which also covers 914s, BTW) and John
Muir's classic "Idiot Book", which is really called something like 
"How to Keep your VW Alive for the Complete Idiot". Also, if you
want to *really* do it right, get the Robert Bently service manual
for Type I. Your total investment at this point should be about $60,
which is really cheap compared to slagging your engine by doing 
this wrong. If you had been talking about any Porsche, I would have
said get the factory service manuals and the "spec book" for your 
particular model. Total investment would have varied from $200 for
a late model 356 to over $600 for a late '70s 911 Turbo. Again,
cheap relative to the cost of the engine...

Count on replacing *all* of the "consumables" -- gaskets, seals, 
bearings, etc. For *EVERYTHING* else, there is listed in the
factory specs a wear tolerance. If anything else is worn beyond
tolerance, reapir or replace it.

I routinely send cranks and rods out to be magnafluxed, and if good,
checked for tolerance then re-done if necessary (including balancing).
It's just a good habit. On heads, you *will* need a valve job. You
may need valve guides. I always replace 356 guides, and measure 9xx
heads to see if it's needed.

Clean everything *SUPERFINE*. I use about 5 gallons of Varsol and
a case and a half of spray carb cleaner (which may be why the Tree
Nazis don't drive Porsches...) on a 914 or 356 engine, much more on
a 911/9444. Anything you miss when cleaning may kill your engine
later on. This includes the *outside* of the engine, too.

Other than that, it really helps to have the right tools. Muir claims
(and he's right) that you can rebuild a VW engine with two cresent
wrenches, a pair of screwdrivers, and an empty beer can.  You just
can't do a job that lasts very long or runs very well.o

Good luck! BTW, I routinely recommend that people contemplating
a do-it-yourself Porsche engine rebuild do a VW motor first. It's
a cheap way to get the hang of it...

WRONG! 944 fuchs wheels were NOT shared with the 911 series. they have their own part numbers and the offsets are clos, but not identical. the 8" fuchs is 951-1362117 and had a 23.3.mm offset. the backspace, i.e. the distance from the inside edge o' the 
wheel to the mounting surface is ~134mm.

I believe that the correct numbers are 23.5 mm for the 1986 and earlier 
944 series, and 52.3 mm for the later ones. I believe that some of the
Turbo S cars may have used something in the low 60 mm range like some
928's, but I'm not sure. 52.3 mm is definitely the correct offset for
1987 944's.

In any case, you don't need to measure the offset. It is embossed on
the inside of each wheel, along with the size(i.e. 7x15x52.3)

On the specific problem of how to get into your car, I would guess that
either you have taken care of that by now, or the car has run out of gas
and you don't need to worry about it yet... however, as far as dealing
with the problem, I would suggest having a copy of the key in your wallet.

Subject: RE: 928 GTS

RE:  Humidity and its effect on engine performance:

I dug up some old textbooks and found this:

Engineering Thermodynamics
by William C. Reynolds and Henry C. Perkins
McGraw Hill, 1977

They discuss humidity and its effect on air in detail,
including useful tables and equations.  I ran some
numbers as an example, under the conditions previously
discussed:

100% relative humidity
20 degrees C
1 atm pressure

And came up with this:

0.01469 kg water per 1 kg air

This relationship is linear, given constant press/temp, 
so at 50% humidity:

0.00734 kg water per 1 kg air

How this affects the partial mass/pressure of oxygen in the
air is: (@100% humidity)

mass of O2 = 0.9855 of dry air

Normally, this is insignificant, but in your case:

0.9855 x (1160 HP) = 1143 HP

You are giving up 17 HP and running rich for lack of
oxygen.  But, the good news is you have turbochargers
to pump up the boost, restore the partial pressure of
oxygen (absolute) and gain the added benefit of water
injection.  It sounds like your engine management system
could handle that variable.  The tables in the book I
mentioned provide enough info for you to construct
an array of partial pressures as a function of RH, temp,
and press.  A humidity sensor may be a trick, because
it typically involves a source of water.

Subject: 87' "phone Dial" wheel confusion


As Jim Selders has said, I believe that the 5-star forged Fuchs were
an optional upgrade.  If you want to keep the phone dials, one option
you might consider is using spacers and longer studs to make up the
difference.  I don't recall the exact dimensions, but the difference
in offsets between the newer and older wheels is within a couple
millimeters of the width of a standard 930 wheel spacer (27mm).  On my
'86 951, I have these spacers on all four wheels with 72mm studs.  If
I had it to do over, I would try 80mm studs on the rear with an
additional thin spacer to increase the rear track.  Nevertheless, my
current setup looks and works fine.  I bought the spacers and studs
from Automotion.  These aren't cheap, but are cheaper than 4 new
wheels.  My goal in using the spacers was to allow me to use "Design
90" wheels (as used, e.g., on the 944 S2s), which, of course, have the
newer offset.

The installation of the spacers and studs does require a bit more
effort than the simple "bolt on" operation one might imagine.  The
spacers on the front (at least the ones I bought from Automotion)
required a slight bit of machining in order to clear the dust covers on
the front hubs.  I paid a machine shop $20 to do this on their lathe
to maintain "hub-centricity".  The installation of the studs on the
front hubs is straightforward, since they are easy to remove and take
to your vise, press, etc.  Unfortunately, the rear hubs are (as far as
I can tell) impossible to remove without destroying the one-piece
wheel bearing assembly.  You need to rig up something (using, e.g., C
clamps and a metal bar) to press out the old studs (don't use a
hammer).  In order to get the clearance you need to slip the new
longer studs into place, you will need to remove the parking brake
linkage from the trailing arm so that use can use the cavity it
normally occupies to get clearance for slipping the new longer studs
behind the hub.  The studs can then be pulled into the hub using a lug
nut (preferably a steel one rather than the softer alloys).

I don't believe so (i.e., mine doesn't work that way).  Your owner's

spectra is made of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene.
it is very strong stuff, much stronger than fiberglass or kevlar.
I got two samples of the cloth. One is very finely woven stuff, 4 yards * 50
inches. I will use this for backpacks and clothing. The other is 30 yards * 50
inches. It is a similar weight (about 4 oz per square yard), but a
much coarser weave, making it unsuitable for clothing and the like.
Think of it as loosely woven fiberglass. I might use the coarse stuff
for building racing seats, or other fiberglass type uses.

You could use it also. I don't know if spectra shield has some kind of
resin like epoxy mixed in. I would guess that it does. The stuff costs
about $20 per yard. If you can't find a better source, I could sell
you some from my coarse roll.

I dont know how you would go about buying straight yardage of spectra shield,
but it is some pretty high-tech stuff.  It is kind of like suped up kevlar
offering higher class protection.  It is used primarily in class IIIA, and
classIII vests intended to stop bullets from light assault weapons.  Kevlar
tops out at class II which is a light load .357 for max protection.  spectra
will pretty much stop any of the handgun rounds except for maybe hot-load .44
and some hard to come by .357 rounds, and of course the newer .50AE magnum
round. In a car it definitely will.  It'll stop lighter assault rifle rounds. 
.223 (m-16), and 7.62(ak-47), but the latter will probably only take a direct
hit or two before it becomes total trash.  Unfortunatly the stuff is extremely
expensive, a little rectangle for a trauma plate  (about 12"X15") costs a
couple hundred dollars.  so forget lining your doors with it.  Thats why an
armouring job costs around 50grand.

is not designed to stand up forever to unlimited blows from whatever the

it is however designed to give you enough time to wake out of your stupor

a tire iron...did a small hold large enough to put one's hand through
appear.  
the article mentioned that for a chevy cavalier, the treatment of all side

as supposedly most cars today have a front windshield already manufactured

<kyle sez:>
Eric has pointed out an unexpected idea.  I have seen this myself and perhaps
this is a small item that could be of use.  Many of you are using a 
sun control film on your windows...I have personal experience in
the effects of this film on how glass breaks.  An impact from a blunt
object will not penetrate the glass/film combination on first attempt.
Since the film is on the inside, you are given a small measure of protection
from flying glass and penetration because the film tends to hold the glass
together.  A few moments may be all one needs to make a getaway.

If there is now a commercial product available for this application, it
may be the cheapest and least invasive of all.

The 915 will bolt into any '64-'86 911 chassis as far as the mounts are

 Yes, there is an old '72 vintage Road and Track article comparing 2.4ltr T E
 and S and in this article the E was faster than the S up to about 100 mph.

 However, there also was a '74 vintage R&T article on the then new 2.7ltr and
 in that article they commented on how much smoother running the new CIS FI
 was compared to the MFI 911's they previously tested in '72 (true or false I
 don't know and this is not my point). They went on to mention that in their
 last test the S version was especially running poorly. I think this
 indicates something was wrong with the tune on the S and this is how the E
 was able to beat it to 100 mph.

 After all, an S has more HP and power, throughout the RPM range, than the E,
 weighs the same, and has the same gearing...How could an E be faster?

 A brief commentary - I have heard this article often quoted as sole evidence
 in several E vs S debates. I try not to believe everything I read, including
 car magazines. I would bet a lot of their writers are journalists, not car
 people, and they probably would just as soon be working at Glamour or Vogue.
 For example, aren't these the same guys who ranted and raved about he Dodge

Reference: 77 911S (2.7)
OK, I am moving along with my engine troubleshooting (it used to not even
turn over).  It turns over but won't start.  The things I have tried:
1) pulled number one wire from distributer and held next to case - no spark
2) checked points and they are opening correctly
3) checked the resistance between 1 and 4 as well as 1 and 15 on the coil with
good resistance. 
4) with iginition on* checked the voltage at terminal 15 on the coil - no
voltage
* - I am doing this by myself and the key is in the on position not trying
to turn the engine over (I can't turn it over and watch the voltmeter at
the same time).  So, will voltage appear with the key in this position (not
trying to turn over the engine?

Another note, when I pull the center lead from the distributer and hold close
to the case and get the wife to turn it over, there is a spark when the
key initially turns on and when the key is turned off but not in between.
Is this normal?  What is supposed to happen, a constant arc?

I am beginning to suspect the wiring.  Are there any further tests that I
can do to track it down further?  Do I need to check the CDS? If so what is
the procedure?  What exists between the key and the coil, anything but wire?

Although I have a '73 911E and would like for this to be true,
I don't think it agrees with Porsche's official figures. As I
recall, the E is a couple of 10ths of a second slower.

A couple of reasons an E might perform faster than an S 0-100
on any given day -- There's more area "under the cam" (keeps
valves open longer and gives the car more low-end power) That's
why S owners scarf up all of the E cams when they rebuild. --
The S ports in the heads and air horns are bigger (that helps
high end performance at a slight sacrifice to low end performance)
An extreme example of this is like putting too much carburettor on a 
car. You know what that's like - you end up with a car that will pass 
anything but a gas station, but gets beat by Yugo's at every stop 
light. 

My guess is that an S with E cams and modified cam timing would
clean the clock on any E -- but they'e going to be as scarce as 
speedsters in a few years. It's fairly easy, however, to rebuild
an E to S specs (keeping the better cams)

Yes, I have seen a product advertised in my junk mail. It is some kind of a
conductive pad to be used on furniture and cars. It plugs into the wall and
gently nudges the animal away. Will let you know next time I see it. Personally,
I would crank up the VOLTS.

Come to think of it, there was an article on an old issue of the Porsche
Tech reprints (Upfixing, Vol 2 or 3) that described how this fellow made this
high voltage generator to protect his parked car. It looked crude and you had
to keep the floor wet (for conductivity...) We are talking '60s technology
here, you know. Let me know, I could probably find it.

Hey, how about calling MTV and asking Beavis and Butthead for a solution to
the cat on a hot tin roof problem. I'm sure those deviants could find
a good solution to your problem. :) Would make a great show!

It's probably unrealistic to borrow your parents' garage or bring one
with you, and you can never outstubborn a cat.  I've seen ads for what
I would call an "electric shock mat" to keep critters off your car or
away from the garbage, etc, but then you would need 110v. 

A shotgun with #8 shot would work well, but be too rough on your paint.

Subject: Did I buy Koni's?


Gang-

While looking through the factory manual (944) in the section specific to
identifying Koni shocks.  It states that the external appearence of the
factory Koni struts available with the M030 suspension ( I'm not positive
on that option code since I don't have the manuals in front of me) is
black with a GREEN painted dot.  

Since I purchased a pair of struts matching the above description for my
'87 924S from a Detroit dealer at last summer's Stoddard swap meet for an
icredible
price of $120 for the pair.  At the time (and because of the price) I
figured they were the std. Boge's.  What I'd like to know is if there are
other ways to determine if I indeed bought a set of Koni's.  I have not
removed the cartridges from the struts yet, but when\if I do what should I
be looking for? Yellow paint?  Is there any way of telling by the part #? 
The # listed in the factory manual doesn't match the one on the box/part. 
The struts came complete in factory sealed boxes btw.

One more note, the manual has a footnote stating that the mentioned struts
(black w/green dot) are not available as spare parts and should be
replaced with Koni's with a different factory setting.  This brings a few
more questions to mind - if I did purchase Koni's are they going to be
compatible with the 924S suspension tuning?  If the black w/green dot
Koni's are not available as spare parts how come I got them from a dealer
who appeared to be clearing out his old stock? Maybe 'cause they arn't
Koni's!  Guess I just answered my own question - It was fun while it lasted:-)

Any thought?

Thanks in advance!

I trust that you are joking about killing the cat. That is an extreme
action to keep from having to use rubbing compound from time to time to
remove a few scratches.

BTW, another way to solve the problem would be to build a simple wooden
ramp so the cats could get to where they want to go without walking up
sloped sheet metal.

sleeping on the hood of my 944 one day and I spotted him.  I pumped up
the BB gun and pretended to be a marksman.  I took a low, grazing
angle across the hood so I could nail him in the chest.  Well, my
aim was fine.  No problems with 'collateral' damage to the car from the
BB.  HOWEVER---The cat woke up startled and started trying to run with
it's claws extended.  It could not get traction, so it kept taking swipe
after swipe at the hood trying to get any of it's four paws to dig in.

I think there's a more rational solutions than trying to 'punish' the cat...

Will,

I received your message, wrote down the number (incorrectly, as it turned

Anyway, I just talked to Sam Shalala at ProTechnik here in Houston who did
the work last year.  They used a 924 turbo disk and heavy duty 944 parts for
the flywheel and pressure plate.  The machining was on the flywheel to
accomodate the 924 disk.  They also replaced the guide tube and throwout
bearing.  The whole job was expensive (~$1500) but should last the life of
the car.

Sam says he has talked to Sachs about the problems with the rubber hubs.
They say, basically, they would rather sell lots of replacement clutch
disks than fix the problem.  Further, PAG refuses to acknowledge their
flawed design decision.  In fact, the 968 is still using the rubber hub.
Sam also said the statements about the rubber hubs being 'kinder' on
components than the spring-centered parts is just BS put out by Porsche
to keep folks off the track.

By the way, I have been extremely with the spring-centered setup.  It even
seems to feel better than the original system.

Hope this answers your questions.  [oh yeah, the heavy duty 944 parts
mentioned above are 944 Turbo items]  If you would like to chat some try

I prefer the paintball gun approach. Not only does it provide
the animal with a physical reminder not to repeat the behavior, 
but when they go to clean off the paint, they also get negative 
food oriented stimulus. This approach gives the animal feedback
in two different areas of the brain, improving the possiblility
of affecting the behavior.

I don't think there's anything hard to believe about a 1200hp engine.
I doubt this whole story (and thank Hans, er Chris for saying so first)
because it doesn't seem logical.  Sure, I can see a project of building
a powerful engine.  It's possible for any of the other improvements, too,
like a body designed from scratch for low cf, with active panels; like
ABS; like a 4WD system; like sophisticated computer engine control.

However, what would undergraduates (any number of them) be doing putting
all of this together in the same project spanning 2 years so far?!  I was
at an engineering school only a few years ago, and our school had the
Mini-baja and the SAE Methanol marathon projects.  These are projects you
can get your hands around.

I would think funding would dictate a smaller project, and at least, it
seems like if you needed to get 1200 hp on a budget, a chevy would be
a much better choice than a 928GTS (not even just a plain old 928 or 928S).

    The good news is that the electrical part of the air box works as

    The bad news is that I'm back to square 1.

    Symptoms:  Poor idle, part-throttle lag, occasional backfire.
With the idle adjusted *way* up, it still just barely runs.  When the flap in

(probably close to where it's currently adjusted).  No obviously disconnected
vaccuum hoses.  Carb cleaner test so far shows no leaks.  Haven't tried all the
hoses with the cleaner yet, but that's probably next.
    The flap in the air box doesn't *quite* rest on the rubber stops.  It will
hit them when depressed and released, but then it comes to rest slightly off of
them.  Query:  Is this normal/tolerable?  It doesn't *feel* like the flap is

Hello from a new member, gardner@physics.nps.navy.mil,

Does anybody know the correct total number of spacers behind the 911 fan belt 
adjustment nut/washer? Am interested in information on any year.  Dealer 
mechanic says 7 for a '76 911S, but is not certain.

For sale:  Complete air conditioning system for 911 with York compressor and 
factory-style bracket.  Would like about $150.00 or trade for some other 911 
parts.  Buyer pays shipping, please.

While you're out there shooting the cat with air-rifles and spraying
Kitty with flammable agents *I* have learned to harness the energy of
my cat. Here's what I do:

I park the 911 in the garage and strap miniature buffing pads to my
cat, Toonsis' paws. Then, I squirt a dollup of liquid wax on the hood
and put him up there. Then I give him a good whiff of cat-nip and come
back in 1/2 hour and it's all done. Of course depending on the dosage
of cat-nip he can get down to bare metal around the rear view mirrors.

Short of a garage, try orange peel.  It lasts for two days or so.  I'd put the
orange peel on some saran wrap or something to make sure the car's surface
doesn't suffer any acidic effects from the peel.  Anyway, cats hate the stuff.

	Howdy,

	I just lost all forward and reverse gears on my 914 the other
week.  Let me describe what happened so that I can ask for help from
porschephiles.

	I was accelerating in 2nd gear when all of a sudden the gearshift
jumped out of gear and I was coasting along.  As a side note:  whenever
I accelerated in the car, the gearshift would deflect - why did it do
this?

	In any case.  Now I can get the car into first and reverse,
but it doesn't move!! :-(  I am unable to easily get into any other
gears.  I finally had a chance to crawl under the car and take a look,
but except for a little bit of fluid on the underside of the trannyu
everything looks fine.

	There are two possible scenarious (sp?) that I came up with:
		1) tranny blew up (through either lack of oil or
		some other reason.)

		2) shift linkage became misaligned due to the deflection
		(why it deflects I still don't understand)

	What does porschephile think about this?  I have gone through
the archives and no one else seems to have had this problem before :-(.

	Any suggestions and/or explanations for any of the above 
behavior would be appreciated!!

IMHO: buying a good cover is worth the investment

Before my daughter's cat got chewed-up by the neighbor's dog :-( (I
actually kinda liked the cat too...)
he resided in the garage containing my Porsche.  As long as I kept the cover
on the car, the cat stayed off of it.  I generally don't keep the cover in the
car all the time (my wife said I was being "anal" about it) when 

driving it about, but am pretty diligent about keeping it covered while
in the garage.  It would seem to be even more important if the car were

I live in a Condo so I don't have an enclosed garage, just under-

cats paw prints on the cover but didn't mind too much, cover can
be washed.  Then the critter slept on the cover one night and left
some of his fleas behind, I rolled up the cover and stored it in the
rear, presto, fleas in the carpets and bites all over my legs.
I had to set off a flea bomb to get rid of them.  After that I still
covered the car but then I safety pinned a thin sheet of plastic on
the surfaces that the cat would likely try to sleep, that got rid of
it.  One of my cat loving neighbors :-) suggested a saucer of anti-

Then there was the time it brought it's "kill" onto my cover, but
that's another story.

Hi everyone,

I'm looking at an '84 Carrera, 180K miles, 165-170 compression all around, 
synchros and clutch replaced 30K ago.  Has one broken head stud.  The
car is in IMMACULATE condition.  Tons of records.

Now the questions:

1. What is the car worth?
2. Should I forget about it?
3. Would I have a hard time selling in the future with the kind of mileage it has?

Again, the only thing I'm concerned about is the engine.  The rest of the is 
literally spotless.

Oh, they are asking $15.9K.

Subject: Thanks and Winter Storage (Again)


First, thanks for the comments on Zims - I'll send some business their way
this weekend.

Secondly, I was finally getting a bookcase re-stocked (only six months after
moving - I'm getting better at this! ;-) and came across an old issue of the
local magazine for the Roadrunner Region in New Mexico.  There was a reprint
of an article from West Texas Region about putting Porsches away for the
winter.  The author suggested that instead of running the motor for 30 minutes
every couple of weeks, you could:  

1)  Disable the fuel pump (take out the fuse, relay, unhook wires, etc.)

2)  Crank the motor until the oil pressure light goes out.

3)  Repeat a couple of times a month.

The idea was to send oil squirting around in the motor but not produce any
harmful by-products from combustion (like water vapor!)  The fuel pump trick
is to keep from washing down the cylinders w/ gasoline.  The article also 
mentioned that you could start the car and run it but you should make sure
that it comes up to operating temp. - drives off water in the oil and dries 
the motor innards.

In reading the article I realized that I may have a hard time getting the oil
up past 100 deg F this winter w/o driving the car.  It's a 2.7L that doesn't 
make it up to 210 deg F unless it's ran hard on a 100 def F day.  So, I may
decide on the *cranking but not firing* idea.  

Comments?  Has anyone out there ever had a 911 in storage for about six months?
I'm beginning to hate this Ohio life-style!!  Give me salt-free roads and
twisty mountain passes or give me a lobotomy so I can enjoy driving a Chevy

Sounds like air injection ports into the head.  The 928's used to have
this sort of air injection to achieve emissions.  Apparently, during
engine warm-up air injection would be applied to the heads to deal
with the very rich mixture used during cold start.  After warm-up, that
would stop and air injection would be done down-stream of the lambda
sensor, so that the sensor could do its job.

I am quoting someone else here, obviously.  I only have half a 928
engine in my car!  (A little humor for us 944S owners!)

I'm sure he is, but I can feel for him.  It's not so much the scratches,

Subject: ignition woes again


Due to the overwhelming under response to my last note (it may have been 
mistaken for a fur ball), I thought I would try again with a different
question.  What are the proper wire connections from the ignition to the coil
and distributer?  I have two white wires (that has a hot and ground) that 
appear to be coming from the iginition.  One goes to the coil with the hot
going to one side of the coil (4) and the ground going to the other (1). 
Another ground wire is coming from (1) and goes to the blower housing.  Now,
the other white wire goes to the distributer with the hot lead connected to
the (condenser) and the ground going to another bolt on the blower housing.
It was my understanding that one hot wire comes from the ignition and connects
to one of the terminals on the coil.  Then another wire connected the
condenser with the other terminal on the coil.  Is this not correct?

The problem I am having is that the plug does not get a spark when it is
supposed to.  When turning the engine over the plug seems to only get a random
spark when the key is initially turned on or off.  Any help would be
appreciated.

Book Review                                       Kevin Gross

Motorsports Medicine
Dr. Harlen C. Hunter and Rick Stoff
published by Lake Hill Press

Two years ago, when yours truly took on the task of being our region's 
Safety Chair, I did so not knowing a whole lot about safety stuff.  I was 
equipped with a certain amount of common sense, and of course had 
available all sorts of "received knowledge" (perhaps better referred to 
as "oral history"), for what they're both worth.  Probably not much.

So my plan was to educate myself.  There are thousands of books out 
there on cars and motorsports; just take a look at Classic Motorbook's 
catalog.  Surely there were at least a few having to do with safety sorts 
of things, right?  Well, no.  The only sources I came up with were 
published by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA): their General 
Competition Rules (GCR's), and their Medical and Safety Manual.

Both documents have quite a bit of interesting information.  The 
GCR's describe acceptable safety equipment, such as roll bars and 
cages, harnesses, and so forth, and how to install and use them.  It 
really is not a good source of the "why" sort of information, though.  
The Medical and Safety Manual is largely devoted to staffing racing 
events with medical and emergency people and apparatus, and to 
managing medical emergencies.  It does have a few other tidbits, for 
example, brief safety guidelines for fuel system design.

Then along came Hunter and Stoff's book.  To get right to the point, it 
is a terrific book, and I recommend it not only to the safety czars of the 
world, but to anyone involved with high performance or competitive 
driving.

The book's subtitle is "Race Faster! Longer! Safer!" and in its 250 
pages, the authors do their best to suggest how that might best be 
accomplished.  A good half of the book is devoted to driver 
preparation, how to get in shape, what sorts of foods to eat and drink, 
vision and hearing issues, and the role of age (good news here for us 
post-teenagers).  They also give attention to matters of sleep, 
dehydration, exposure to the sun, and so forth.  And after all, what's 
the point of having that MFI tuned to 100% if the driver's only 
running at 80%?

The rest of "Motorsports Medicine" has chapters covering safety 
equipment and medical issues, such as what sorts of injuries take 
place.  On the latter, quite a few surprises.  You might guess that the 
most common injury to a driver is to his or her neck.  But how about 
burns: most are due to contact with coolant, not fire.  "Wheel whip" 
injuries to the hands and wrists are also quite common; ask Nigel 
Mansell about that.

The only problem you're likely to have with the book is finding a copy
of this privately published book.  Locally, European Performance
Engineering has a number of copies in stock (508 651 1316).  You can also
order it from Mittler Bros. Machine and Tool in Missouri, (314 673 2464).
Those Santas out there looking for a stocking item for their car-
crazed spouses would do well to throw a copy of  "Motorsports 
Medicine" in the back of the sleigh.

I presume it's the same design as for my '82 Coupe. Then you have to remove
the backs of the rear seats and to remove the whole panel which holds the
speakers. That's no problem. The problem is to find replacement speakers
to fit that tiny space. I would guess that the Blaupunkt speakers that I
removed had a height of 1,5".

My plans for a better sound in the car is to remove the rear seat (like the '92
Carrera RS) and to place 6X9" in the box that I then have to build...

Good luck / Magnus

Based on the gearshift diflection on acceleration prior to the more
serious symptoms, I would suspect a motor mount problem. To relieve
(or exaserbate) your anxiety, you may want to disconnect the shift
linkage at the transmission, shift the transmission into a gear manually
at the transmission itself, and prove that there are gears still inside.
Then you can chase the linkage problems, from the motor mounts or
otherwise, more calmly.

Last Friday, I had a run in with a laser gun on the US35 bypass south of

I hold a NY license (which, as I understand it, means it won't show up on my

would like to contest this citation, and at least get it reduced to a non

    I have heard that a "broken transmission mount" will cause this

SUBJECT: '84 Carrera

In response to the question on the high mileage '84 Carrera....

I wouldn't be afraid of the mileage, although it will affect resale. You can
expect 250 - 300K miles out of a 3.2 motor that's maintained fairly decently.
Things off the top of my head: Have the cam chains been replaced? Should
figure this in to the price if not. Alternators fail every 60 - 80K or so. If
it has a ltd. slip it'll need rebuilding (won't hurt anything, just doesn't
work well). Compression test isn't good enough for me -- I'd do a leak down
test, it's the only *real* way to know the top end condition. Rotors could
need replacing, depending on what type of driving (city vs. highway).
Depending on the options, the price might be ok. If only a couple or none of
the desirable options are on it, I'd work on the seller over the price.

Take it to the *best* independent shop you can find in the area and have them
do a full "buyer checkout" -- should reveal any hidden items that will affect
your offer or even whether you want to purchase it at all. I once came really
close to buying a '78 SC that was still with orig. owner (wife only drove the
car, etc.), but failed the leakdown -- it crushed me and the owner (I really
wanted it, it was beautiful in all other aspects), but it had a cracked piston
or broken ring according to my trustworthy shop, and wouldn't have been worth
the hassle or expense (seller didn't believe my mechanic and thought I was
after a lower price) -- I just passed on it...

When I was out in CA last week I looked at a couple of '84s that had the
*right* options and in excellent low (for '84) mileage condition in the $22 -
$23K range. We've decided to keep ours until we get back to CA where the
market is better (offers in the $19K range aren't gettin' it..).

Hope this helps you some...       good luck!

Yes. They come out topside.  Try Circuit City, I found some really nice ones

It is an Oil Thermostat, assuming it's not *just* in front of the oil tank,
but rather in front of the rt. rear wheel and in the the fender well behind
the door.  This thermostat sends the oil to the front fender cooler when it
gets hot enough (192 deg F or so)

Subject: Re: ignition woes again

     I don't have a solution for your ignition problem, just a
little insight.  The coil will generate a high-voltage (spark)
whenever the primary current is *CHANGED*.  That is why you get a
spark when you turn the ignition switch on, and again when you
turn it off.  This indicates that the high-voltage portion of the
ignition is OK (coil and wiring).  The problem is either in the
distributer triggering mechanism (points, magnetic, or photo
triggering depending), or the electronics controlling current to
the primary winding of the coil.  Too bad it's so expensive to
just swap parts 'till you find it.

Subject: Re: Speakers

     I recently replaced speakers in my '83 Targa.  It made a BIG
difference.  In my car, the rear speakers were removeable without
fussing with any of the interior upholstery.  Just remove the
four screws (ea) lift them out and disconnect the wires.  When
you look at them it will be obvious why the sound is poor.

     I replaced mine with Boston Acoustics C700 plates (woofer
and tweeter).  These are rectangular units which stand about 1"
above the mounting surface.  The "plate" configuration solves the
problem with lack of depth clearance associated with an oval co-
axial configuration.  The woofer magnet fits through the old
hole.  You don't have to do any cutting, although you will put
screws through the upholstry to mount the plates.  This isn't a
problem unless you want to go back to the originals at some later
time.  They sound great!  You can save some $ by ordering them
mail order.

T&D Performance (Campbell), Ken's SportTech (Campbell), Anderson-

Scotts Valley and Santa Cruz I can't think of.  Incredibly, every one of
these shops knew Bob Grigsby and had great things to say about him
(and they are competitors!).  Grigsby has his own shop, and does all
the work himself.  He goes out of the way when he services your car
to look for warning signs and other problems you should be alert to.
His prices are comparable to the others, maybe even 5% higher or so
(but then he's doing all the work not some hourly grunt).  And he's
never failed me in the 5 years I've been going to him.

Grigsby only works on air-cooled Porsches and has been doing it for
more than 20 years.  His wife, Linda, is some kind of parts specialist
for Carlsen's.  They both drive 356s and show their cars.  Obviously
your typical Porsche-crazy family.

I was running some errands this weekend and happened to see this
car for sale.  I thought it was a good deal so I'm passing it
on for any local folks to consider if they are in the market.

The car is a '78 911SC.  The odometer shows 141K.  The car is 
VERY clean (bright orange) with a tail, and the rear fenders
may have been replaced as they looked very wide to me, but I
couldn't find any seems or other signs.  It has a 3.0 motor
(is that correct or is this still in the 2.7 series) that sounds
very healthy and I was told that all cylinders are around 160 psi.
The car was taken as a trade and the guy (Mike Hennessy) doesn't
want it, so the price to move it is $11K.  The car has a/c (didn't
check to see if it worked), sunroof, brown interior.  I'm really
more into the '69-72 911's but for $11K this car is so clean that
I gave it some serious thought.

Mike can be reached at (408) 292-3121, and is located in San Jose
CA.  This is a repair shop that also gets special interest/classic

  Anyone got suggestions on 4x6 replacement speakers they have put into a 944 or

Subject: Factory Tour....

I went on a tour of the Porsche Factory yesterday.  I thought some of you may be interested in some of the things I heard.  Mainly trivial facts.

Each car is made on order.  It must be prepurchased from the customer or dealer.  They have a spec for the thing that is to be produced, and the configuration must come together at the right points to give the right model, engine, colour, interior, country requirements, etc. as specified for the customer.  I think BMW do the same as well now.  But it sounds like a bit of organisation to get it all there at the right time....`

Apparently there are already 400 orders for the boxer from the U.S.  Production release is Sept. 1995- ready for '96.  Sales of the 993 (next generation 911) is quite good and they seem to think that this is going to pull them out of the s__t.

It takes average of 3 1/2 hours to assemble a 911 engine.  These engines are assembled on a production line by a number of mechanics.  On the other hand a 911 turbo, 928, and 968 engine are assembled by one person only, he (they only employ males on the production lines) follows the engine around the line.

Someone talked about the dyno testing and breaking in of engines.  An engine must be between 100 and 105% of the designed performance figures.  They also take into account the atmospheric conditions in doing the testing.  An engine, even when over powered is returned to be reassembled - or repaired - if it does not meet the perfomance criteria.  Except with special engines such as for the 911 RSR, here the overpowered engines are also sold to the customer, but completely at random, you can't choose the engine you want.

In the paint shop (didn't really get to see much there, except a poster describing what is happening) they do not use robots to do the painting.  It is still all done by hand.

The 993 - next generation 911 - was in production.  Main differences seem to be sloped back headlights, like on the 959.  Also the rear guards sort of looked like nicer shaped 944 box guards.  It looks real good.

There was a 3.8 911 RSR on the 993 production line when I was there.  I wonder who santa is visiting this christmas.  It was plain white with a huge rear tail on it.  It was about to go into the line where the "technical interior" is added (i.e. all the suspension, engine, etc.).  All the 911s at this stage have the interior, except for front seats in place.  The RSR only had its roll cage and the drivers seat mount - I suppose thats about all you want in a race car...

It takes them about 15 mins to bolt the car to the engine and transmission.  The car is lowered onto the engine and rear transmission with the rear engined thingies.  The engine is sitting on a trolley which starts to roll along as the car is moving on the production line.  The workers are mostly sitting on stools which roll along as well when the are doing this part.

The last thing we saw was the upholstery room.  Your 911 requires about 13 square metres of leather for the interior.  There is about 30% wastage in the cutting for cow hide, 40% for buffalo, and 70% for osterrich.  Yeah this guy got his leather interior done in osterrich leather.  He only wanted the leather which had the nice feather pattern as well (and it was died purple).  It cost about 20,000 DM for this option.  But Porsche will do it in whatever you can get hold of (same with paint colout).  I wonder what they would think of kangaroo or koala (bear)  (Oops, forgot about the animal libbers B^).  I think they said it takes about 10 hours to make a leather dashboard.

After seeing the factory and finding how out how long it takes to make things I have some serious problems with my mechanic, my painter, my upholosterer, etc....  I think I might pull my engine on a Saturday when I get home, you know pull it apart and put it back in on Sunday.

As we were about to leave the museaum Aerosmith (heavy metal band touring Germany at the moment) turned up to do a tour of the factory - and most likely pick up cars as well.  Our guide/ public relations woman was telling us that she hates taking heavy metal people around.  She told us that she showed Judas Priest around once and he started off into the production line, picked things up and waved them around, got carried away, etc.  Wonder what these boys got up to???

They had some Japanese guys wandering around the factory, looking over shoulders.  Apparently they are brought in from some managment consultants to improve production.  So management had all these signs for the workers saying try to work 10% more while they are here.  Doesn't seem to make sense to me - shouldn't they be seeing how they are normally working.

The museaum wasn't quite as good as I expected (especially after seeing BMW and Mercedes).  They only had about 30 cars.  While in Stuttgart you should also see the Mercedes museum, it has the first automobile there, as well as many others.  It includes many cars developed for Mercedes by F. Porsche no. 1.  I went there on a Sunday.  They said during the week it is quite likely you can just slip into a group for a factory tour there as well without booking (providing your not a large group).  However I did not really have the opportunity to go back for this.

At the Porsche factory I would have liked to have seen the body fabrication, I don't know why they didn't show us that.  I wanted to see some welding robots working, maybe at mercedes they would have that.  Anyhow keep that in mind if your heading to Stuttgart.  Next time I should find someone that can get me to Weisach as well.

Anyhow just a bit of trivia.

Subject: Cats and Dogs


The suggestion of tying a dog to the bumper reminded me of what happened 
on one of our region members a couple of years ago. He took about 30 minutes
to tell the entire story (it was the first time he could talk about it
since it had happened). Of course, a few beers and his spouse explaining
her side of the story made it quite humorous.

The dog was acquired when his spouse found it as a stray. They were headed
out of town the next day and she talked him into letting the dog go along.
The dog gets car sick and pukes on the leather seats. While visiting 
his brother, the dog messes up the white carpet in the living room.
Departing early, they head home and stop to eat at a restaurant. Not wanting
to leave the dog in the car, they tie it to the bumper. When they come out
of the restaurant there is something on the car. As they get closer to the
car they make it out to be -- the dog. Closer inspection reveals that the
dog had a really hard time getting up on the car. The scratches were so bad
that the car had to be repainted.

It was a couple of weeks before he spoke to his spouse. I don't know what 
happened to the dog (it did come home with them, inside the car - not tied 
to the bumper).

They joined one of our tours recently and they had a parrot in the back
seat (caged). I think there's an animal lover in the family.

Hello!

Some of you may recall me lamenting that the wastegate diaphragm on my
faithful (?) 931 "bought the farm" a couple of months ago.  Since then, 
I have been on a quest for parts to get the car back on the road.  During the
course of this work, I discovered that it is strongly recommended that the
factory boost NOT be increased on these machines, either by putting in a 
different wastegate spring or by using one of the variable "dial-in-boost" 
methods, in the absence of an intercooler.  Too bad, because these 
much-demeaned little 2-liter engines ("...really an Audi..., etc.") are 
really capable of a large output under high boost.


My naive question then: Does anyone know of any 924 Turbo Carrera 
intercoolers gathering dust somewhere that might be for sale at a reasonable 
cost?  If so, I would appreciate it if you would let me know.


Many thanks.

Subject: Looking for 3.0 911 Engine

Well the winter is upon us, and just in time my 2.4 engine
broke a valve and caused much related damage in 2 cylinders.
It was getting about time for a rebuild anyway. (probably cut this one
too close!) So I was in process of trying to decide 
whether to rebuild do a straight rebuild, bring it to "S" specs
or just swap in a 3.0 motor.  Haven't examined the bottom end
yet so how much work "down there" is unknown.

As long as I've already gone down the golden path of spending
more $$$ it seems like a good time to consider swapping up to 
a 3.0 engine.  The engine already has webbers so rejetting would
be needed. The transmission is a 915 series.  The car is a 71 911
but the motor+transmission was swapped in some 70K miles ago, so
originality isn't a high priority.

I've looked around Portland and haven't found a good 3.0 "just
laying around".  A couple that are probably in the same shape as
my 2.4, but I'd prefer a recent rebuild (I know more  $$$) and
consider saving the 2.4 fun for a 914 replacement when this project
finishes.

Soooo, anyone have good experiences to pass on? Both for engine
parts and 3.0 "suppliers".

  Why don't you call the guy up that you sold the car to and give

Fellow Porschephiles,

I am unlucky enough to own an '82 931 from the era of Big 
Brother when the 85 mph speedometer was imposed, even on 
Porsches.  At a recent swap meeting I was able to pick up, 
for almost nothing, a VDO speedometer that looks exactly 
like my original 85 mph VDO except that its range goes to 
170 mph.  It was allegedly from a 924 (170?!!).  The only 
part number I can find is on the back and it is 67 127 067.

Here is my question:  What do I have to do, besides the 
obvious swap, to make the calibration fit my 931?  In other 
words, does anyone know what I might have to do to make this 
speedometer read true if I do the swap?  My 931 has the 5-
speed transmission with 15 inch, five spoke "spider web" 
alloy wheels and disk brakes all around.

Any insight into this before I make the switch would be 
appreciated.

I am on the lookout for one as well.  I would like to work the 931 into a GT replica in about 1 1/2 - 2 years time, so I am starting to connect the parts.  If you find a source of second hand ones let me know.  I would really like to get the full specs for this car - if anybody has them let me know.

I think to get the intercooler new you are going to be looking at around $1500, but connected up well you are probably looking at least a 30 HP increase.

I spoke to a guy that has a black carrera GT for sale in Australia (only 14 were brought into Aus - his is the only one in black).  The guy wants about A$90 K.  So a replica would have to be getting close to half if done well I would think.

The other thing you have to think about is it is not just a matter of connecting the carrera intercooler.  You will want to do something to get the cold air to it.  Thus the reason why the carrera has the hood scoop.  If you want to mount it that way you are going to need some body work.

I have seen a 931 which had an intercooler fitted where the w-washer bottle is.  Thus you no longer have washers.  I think it was an intercooler from a RX-7.  But there was also a bit of ducting to connect it up.  Whereas the original intercooler sits on top of the tappet cover.  The guy couldn't close the hood as fluch as it was before as well.  I would prefer to do the job properly if it was going to be done at all.  It would also be worth checking out where the 951 intercooler is fitted and the possibility of connecting one of those.

Just some ideas....

My Carrera 3.0 came without an owner's manual.  Would I have cared
it was in German?  No.

Trying to understand the dashboard ("Druck?")  I bought a United
States `77 911 manual from Stoddard or somewhere (this covers both
S and Turbo and is the one I'm offering for sale).  Did they have
a Euro Carrera manual?  No.

Later I was able to find an English-language Euro Carrera owner's
manual, available at a highly inflated price from some
enterprising Rhode Island resident.  Probably a politician on the
side.

If and when I sell my car, I'll sell the manual with it.  Along
with all the other good stuff that didn't come with the car, like
the Fuchs and the '84 tensioners and the rear seat belts and the
CHMSL...

>    Several people have mentioned the 'leakdown' test to evaluate the

A leakdown test is in effect a measurement of the rate of air flow
into each cylinder with all of the valves closed. The magnitude of the
air flow determines the total leakage from all valves plus the rings
(plus anywhere else it manages to leak). It is possible to determine the
source of the leak (which valve, etc) by listening for the sound of
escaping air at the intake manifold, exhaust pipe or crankcase breather.

A leakdown tester is typically constructed by measuring the pressure
drop across a restrictor (just like measuring current by measuring
voltage drop across a resistor, if you think in electrical analogys).
Thus the physical appearance is an input to connect to a source of
air pressure (perhaps 80-100 PSI), a pair of pressure gauges (or a
pressure regulator and a single gauge) to measure differential pressure,
and an output hose to connect to an adapter which screws into a spark
plug hole. Leakdown measurements are most frequently expressed as a
pressure difference, rather than translated into an actual flow rate.

In use, the engine is first brought to operating temperature, so
everything fits. Then, with the engine stopped, each cylinder is brought
to TDC on the compression stroke, the plug removed, the adapter
substituted, and the pressure difference (e.g. flow rate) measured.
It is also possible to measure the leakdown at other than TDC (given
that the valves are still closed) if a means is provided to hold the
crank from rotating against the pressure (80 PSI x roughly 12 Sq. In.
for a 4" piston = lots of force). This allows measuring ring leakage at
other locations along the cylinder wall. You can get away without holding
the crank at TDC if you set it accurately enough.

Having said all this, does anyone happen to know if there are standards
for the flow restriction which allow readings from a leakdown tester
made by one supplier to be compared to readings from another supplier's
tester?
An alternative would be a "calibrated leak", formed by a certain size
drill, for instance, which produces a given pressure difference.
I would like to know if my leakdown tester produces readings comparable
to others, so that when I talk about an engine with 3 PSI leakdown I
know how it compares to others.

   .......LEAKDOWN TEST........
       Several people have mentioned the 'leakdown' test to evaluate the
   condition of an engine. Please, can someone describe the test method,
   the equipment used, and significance of the results in terms of
   engine condition.

Test Method: Bring cylinder to TDC (top dead center) compression
stroke, remove spark plug and insert tester. Pressurize cylinder with
shop air (approximately 100 psi) and measure the ratio of input
pressure to cylinder pressure. The result is what is called "percent
leakdown" and is expressed as a percentage. For example, if the input
source air pressure is 120 psi from the shop compressor, and the
cylinder gauge is reading 105, then the percent leakdown is:
(120-105)/120=13%. Note: shop air is kept on during entire test so
there is some "flow" through the system at all times. This helps to
determine problems, see below.

Equipment Used: Leakdown tester is very simple. Device has an input
for high pressure air (shop air) with a one way valve and a gauge to
read input air pressure. There is also a gauge to read cylinder
pressure so you can get the ratio. In order to pressurize the cylinder
there is a fitting to thread into the cylinder head spark-plug hole,
often interchangeable for different sized plugs.

Significance of Results: For a healthy engine, the measurement used is
"percent leakdown" which refers to the ratio of input pressure to
cylinder head pressure. There is always some leakdown, even in a new
engine, but it should be fairly low, like <10%. As long as the number
is low, no further diagnostics are required. *But* if the number is
high, then the device can be used to pinpoint the bad part, because
the excessive leakdown will make an audible "hiss" that you can hear.
For example, you do a leakdown on #3 cylinder of your 944 and you get
45% leakdown, and you examine further and hear hissing coming from the
exhaust it is possible you have a problem with the exhaust valve
seats, bent valve etc. Other area to look for air leakdown are bubbles
in the coolant (cracked head, blown head gasket, cracked block),
hissing in the intake manifold (bent valves, cracked head) or pressure
building up in the crankcase (rings worn, cracked block). This is only
one tool in the arsenal but it is very useful. 

Don't throw away the compression gauge however, it can do something a
leakdown tester can't, and thats give a nice time-history of the
combustion chamber pressurization. So one is not necessarily "better" 
than the other, they just tell you different information.

(as far as I know) so I guess I already have some idea of the condition of
my guides... ;-(

Thoughts?  I'm sure this will spur lots of questions on my part about rebuilding
of 911 heads...

Thanks guys.  Have a good Thanksgiving for our state-side friends.  Catch you

Rather than give results in absolute pressure difference from the
gages, I cumpute it as a ratio or percentage, so it can relate to
other measurements.  An easy way is to set the test pressure at 50 psi,
and compare this to the cylinder pressure.  For example, a cylinder
pressure of 47 psi would indicate a cylinder leak down percentage of
6%.  This could be compared to someone else's test done at another
pressure.  Porsche engines should always have less than 5% leak-down.

Subject: Alternator idiot light acts like one...

I recently had my alternator on my '80 SC rebuilt (all the insurance
company would cover).  It seemed okay until the other day, when I got all
the signs of a bad charging system - tach flying all over the place,
engine running rough, then dying followed by 'rrn rrn rrrrr<silence>' when
I turned the key.  The only missing sign was the alternator light not
coming on.  The shop tested the alternator, said it was bad, sent it to
the rebuild shop who said it was fine.  They're putting it back in this
afternoon to see what happens (real scientific guys, eh?)  My question is
how could the alternator light not be coming on in this case?  I thought
normally this would preclude starting the engine, although I do remember
it coming on when the ignition is first switched on, so I don't think it's
simply been bypassed.  Is there anything that might have been done by one
of the unscrupulous shops I've used in the past (hint: don't use the
authorized Porsche dealer in Columbia, SC) that would mask a low-charging
indication by the light without interfering with the ignition?  I'd give
more detailed explanations, but I haven't gotten a chance to commune with
my car for a while now... the shop here in Charlotte ain't exactly 'while you

I had been told, for the Snap-On leakdown tester, that if you
set the air regulator for 100 lbs, you can read the leakdown
as a percentage. Thus 3 PSI would be 3%. Wouldn't that 
automatically calibrate different testers? or is that too

Bob, as well as others, suggests that using percentages solves the
calibration problem. Percentages may solve the problem that one
tester measures at 50 PSI and another at 80 PSI, but it doesn't
solve what I see as the larger and also more subtle source of error,
which is the nature of the restriction across which the pressure
difference is measured. Depending of the restriction, a given pressure
difference (or percentage, if you like) can correspond to radically
different flow rates, which are what you are really trying to measure.
If electrical analogies help, think about measuring current by knowing
the voltage difference but not what resistance it is measured across.
Percentages don't help much.

This could be managed by comparing the details of the restrictions
in each different type of leakdown tester, but that is buried in the
instrument. Another approach is an external >>flow<< standard, like
a calibrated hole. I made such a standard by putting a pipe plug
(brass) into a quick disconnect fitting and then drilling a hole in
it, expanding the hole until the tester read 5 PSI drop at 80 PSI
(or about 6%). My intent was to take this "standard leak" to the
local Porsche guru, who is also a friend, and ask him to see what
his leakdown tester read with the standard connected. I made the
standard a year or two ago, but the right circumstances never came
up to get it measured by another tester other than mine.

If anyone else on porschephiles is interested, this may be another
forum for the same test. I don't remember the size hole I ended up with
(I do remember being surprised that the hole was relatively large-
perhaps 0.050"?), but I can measure the hole tonight. If someone else
wants to build the same "standard" with the same hole size we can
do the calibration remotely. The flow may not be exactly the same due
to the details of air flow, even with the same hole size, but it seems
that it ought to be in the ballpark.

Is anyone interested (who has a leakdown tester)?

Half the 'fun' of driving a 911 is figuring out what combinations will
keep you cool, warm or window-fog-free.  With 3 or so different sets of

When you get this kind of failure mode it can be that one of the brushes
are broken. You then don't get any current to the alternator light when
turning the key. And, of course, you don't get any warning that the 
alternator doesn't work when driving. I had this problem with my '82 SC 
with Paris-Rhone alternator (WHY a French alternator in a quality sport car??) 
so now I always check that the alternator warning light comes on when turning 
the key.

Carrera Sport :-)

	However, according to the UK car magazines, 3.2 Carrera prices have
jumped by up to 5k pounds (!) over the last 6 months or so (and the prices
I have seen do reflect this), whereas 944 prices are only just starting to
move upwards (according to this month's _Buying Cars_, anyway).

	So, when is the differential likely to be least? Will 911 Carreras
continue to rise faster than 944s or will the gap narrow? Any thoughts? My
finances will be in much better shape by early next year (one loan will
finally be paid off!!), but I don't want to wait till then only to find
that 911s have gone through the roof!

	Will the introduction of the "new" 911 affect used prices? Has
this happened in the past when the Carrerra 3.2 or Carrera 2/4 were first
available?

	Should I buy a 968 Club Sport instead?! (only 28k pounds new!)

  | Ok.  So how exactly *do* the heater controls in a `71 911T work?

I am not sure whether you are refering to *how* the heater system
works,or just how the heater control handles should be manouvered.

The theories behind the heating system in the 911 is very similar to
most conventional heating systems.The transfer of excessive heat energy from
engine to the driver's compartement.

Practically there are a few ways to do this,the most common with a
heat exchanger connected to the cars cooling system.This works
fine,....as long as there is water in your hoses.The water in your
cooling system should be about 85-90 deg. C.The water transfer a lot
of this energy into the air surrounding the heat exchanger.This air is
led into the car via ducting.

As the allmighty 911 is cooled by air,the solution mentioned above was
sort of awkward,.....of course being rather familiar with air cooled
engines the Porsche people knew the solution.They had to use the
exhaust gases for this purpose. By 'clamping' a heat exchanger upon
the exhaust tubes,one transfers some of the heat energy.The efficiency
is not as high as the water heated exchanger but the exhaust gases hold a
much higher temperature than the cooling water.
With some 'ducting' from the engine cooling fan,you can put pressure
into this system.Then the heated air is blown forward,via channels in
the chassi and into the car.Then by using a valve you can shut off the
air from the cooling fan,if the Arizonian Summer allows it :)
Some newer 911's have an extra electric blower too.This could be good
for city driving.Remember you need a steady revving engine to keep
that hot air flowing........;)

 To keep the heater system in good order,it is important to use it now
and then.Moisture is trapped inside the heater channels,so be sure to
use the system sometimes on sunny days too.That will assure you a good
working long living heating system.

cheers,
Trond

a key just above the door latch on the drivers side.  When activated the 
car will not start and opening any door or lid causes a medium loud siren
to go off.  The operation key is not the same as the ignition key.

Can anybody confirm that this was a factory option for 911's with a so
called Weissach package in 1980?

More importantly, what about the security of the apparently factory system?
Out of deference to the neighbors I have not been able to locate the siren
so evidently it is reasonably well protected somewhere up front.  But since
I can't find it or any obvious disconnect wires doesn't mean they are easy
for someone more knowleageble. 

Can the key be easily broken?

In short, does anybody know how much security this system provides?

Subject: Some Leakdown Details

To Whom It  May Concern,
	The leakdown test is a relative, not absolute, measurement.  The flow of 
air through the testor orifice is, among other things, a function of the 
pressure difference, fourth power of orifice radius, and orifice length, and 
described by Poiseuille's formula (Landau & Lifshitz, Fluid Mechanics, page 
57).  
	The question becomes one of how large an opening is permitting the air to 
escape from the cylinder.  If no air is escaping, then the pressure in the 
cylinder will equalize with the supply pressure.  Further, the qustion 
becomes the opening size relative to the port dimension.  For example, if 
both a large engine and small engine have the same size defect in a valve 
seat, both will give the same reading during a leakdown test.  However, the 
effect on a small 356 engine vs. a large dragster engine would be 
substantial.  Piston ring end gaps, etc, obviously contribute to the reason 
why the test is only relative.  
	When the test is made, the differences between cylinders is the 
information of value.  However, were someone to test a new or newly rebuilt 
engine and use that as the benchmark for comparison for similarly sized 
engines using the same tester, the leakdown test provides a bit more 
information as to the health of an engiine.  Another advantage of the 
leakdown test is that one may use a piece of hose to determine the source of 
the leaks, i.e. rings, exhaust valve, or intake valve; one does this by 
placing a piece of hose between the ear and the oil filler, tailpipe, and 
induction system, respectively.
	I have built two testers and compared them to the Snap-on tester.  The 
comparison was made by filling a plastic jug with water and inverting it in a 
filled sink.  I then inserted an air nozzle, which was connected to the 
tester, into the jug and measured the time required to fill the jug with air.  
Using a small valve in the fabricate testers, I was able to adjust the air 
flow to match that of the Snap-on tester.  As I recall, the time was 4.8 sec 
for a gallon of water (average after 10 trials).
	For my own purposes as a hobbyist, I have establised a value of 10% 
maximum pressure loss for any 2.0 - 3.0 911 engine cylinder before I become  
concerned (I only work on 911 engines).  At the 30% level, I would probably 
do a rebuid, the extent of which would depend on the source of leak.  

Hope this helps.

	This evening I talked my fiance into helping me with the 914
for a few minutes, as I grying to get a feel for what movements the
shift lever makes going from gear to gear.  While doing that I was idly
spinning  the drivers side wheel and noticed that the passenger side
CV joint was spinning, but the wheel wasn't!!!!  Upon closer inspection
it looks like that CV joint is trashed.  This looks to be the cause
of as least some of my problems (I hope).  I will let you all know how it goes :-).

	Also,  I checked the engine mounts by jacking up the engine,
and seeing if the car and engine or just engine lifted up.  The
car and engine lifted up, so I assume that the engine mounts are 
NOT causing my shift lever deflectiono on acceleratino, does
anyone have any ideas?

Wayne,
  The system you describe is the factory one.  It should not give false
alarms, so don't worry about the neighbors, if it's yelling, you want them
out their with their bats :->
  If you keep the lock lubed, they key will last forever, course, if you
leave it in the lock and close the door your in trouble.  The keys, btw, are
a royal pita to replace so be carefull with them.  I have been told of
blanks but none have ever come to pass.

Subject: Re: 911 security

I also have a question about alarms.  The car I bought today, a '77 911S
has an alarm, which goes off in 30 seconds after the door is openend if
the key does not go in the ignition.  Also, I am wondering if I should
have 2 keys (master and ignition only), as I just received one, which
seems to be a master key.

Here is more info. which I wrote off-line:
 
I bought my first Porsche 911S today.  It's a brown 1977 Coupe, with
125K miles on it.  It has BBS mags, and wider than stock tires, probably
too wide, as I think I've heard scraping once or twice in the 30 or so
miles I drove it today.
 
It leaks engine oil, not sure how much, but the oil pressure is down
around the 40 mark, rarely inching up to 60, and the "oel" gauge is
often down around the red mark, except when going about 90 in 5th gear,
then it gets up out of the red.  I expect it to need engine rebuilding
soon, but hopefully not too soon!
 
The dipstick was around the lower mark, and the manual states that there
is a 2.6 quart difference between the low and high marks, so I added two
quarts of 50 wt. Castrol oil.  I'll measure the oil level tomorrow
morning to try to see how much is burning and falling on the ground.
 
I've also found that the air pump and air conditioner belts are not hooked
up, and the heater is not working.  Hopefully these are simple hook ups.
 
Oddly, the owner, who also has a '75 Porsche 911S, gave me a set of
manuals (green) for a '77 911S turbo carrera, mine is definitely not
a turbo carrera.
 
The car is the most exciting car I've ever driven.  I hope I can keep this
thing running!  I bought some turtle wax, and a Haynes Porsche 911
1965 thru 1989 repair manual.  Thanks to everyone for the tips on buying
the used Porsche.

I am stuck trying to replace the camshaft belt in a 87 951. My model has the
mechanical belt tensioner which does not allow me to remove easily the 
cam belt. The only information that the manual has is that "the belt tensioner
must be removed from the upper crankcase section complete when fitting and 
removing the belt". They do not describe how to do it. 
It is mounted with a nut and a screw. By removing those two guys you can
move the tensioner outwards. I am afraid of removing it this way since there is
fairly strong spring that connects the tensioner arm to the engine. 
Does anybody has any idea how to remove the tensioning arm in order to remove
the belt.

Subject:  Porsche and Ferrari - Why?

A few comments on the recent subject of who owns which type and
why, with a few guesses for your consideration.

I've experience with both types, with both clubs, and with both
at concours.  Recently I've watched the level and content of the
messages here at porschephiles, and I've been watching the same
on USEnet "exotic.cars".

My observation is that a far higher percentage of Porsche people
have access to and interest in Internet communications than do
Ferrari people.  Porsche people are often involved in engineering
jobs and are still climbing within their profession.  They
embrace new technology (internet, email, computers) and have an
appreciation for the technolog embodied in their car.  Therefore,
we on this network see a strong following via
porschephiles@tta.com.

On the other hand, many Ferrari owners are involved in
professions that isolate them from internet, or have reached that
point in their lives where they get their information from others
and use their experience to act on it; they have no direct
contact with a networked computer.  They are involved in enjoying
what they have.  The land developers and private attorneys and
doctors and, well, we could go on.  These are the people who pay
cash for a new $190K Ferrari TR 512 primarily for show, to add a
notch on the goals in life chart.  Note that there is no group on
internet like porschephiles; there should be, but thus far the
critical mass required has not be assembled.

We could rage for pages on the reasons for owning each, and there
are as many valid reasons as there are people.  And certainly the
points I made above are generalizations, where exact opposites to
my assertions do exist.  I, for one, have no Porsches (now), do
have two Ferraris, and am still climbing within my profession (I
think) and am actively on internet, BBS's and play with
computers.  While I don't fit the profile, I do believe the
majority profiles are as I mentioned above.

Final note: I'll bet if we all had our way, we'd have one of
every sports car we saw, just to make sure we could experience
each one at will.  That's what I need!

You need to remember this: any time you ask about how you do X,
or how much X will cost, where X is *ANY* non-stock operation, the
answer is *ALWAYS* "It Depends."

In this case, you have lots of answers *I* need before I can answer:
do you have to worry about emissions issues to keep the car legal
and on the road? is it a racing or competition vehicle, and if so
what class under which sanctioning organization? where do you want
to make the power - under 4k RPM or over 5K RPM?  do you have the 
necessary parts/tools/experience to do this yourself (answer to this
one I know: NO - or you wouldn't be asking)? do you have the budget
to support the development of something like what you're looking for?

>What kind of life expantancy can be built into one?

Depends. Can build anything from a 195 HP 1.8 legal for SCCA Production
class road racing with a 6-10 *HOUR* life expectancy, to a say 135 HP
mostly stock 2.0 with factory EFI and a 50,000 + mile life expectancy.

>What would the displacement be? 

See above. General rules are as follows: smaller displacment means increased
heat of combustion to reach a given HP target. Heat is bad for air cooled
engines, and will shorten life of engine. Larger displacement than 2.0 liter
means you need *special* parts **AND** machine work to make things hang 
together (stroker cranks mean longer rods mean custom barrel spacers and
custom exhaust... big bore means bigger holes in the case and need for 
lightened parts... etc.).  You also have to factor in RPM limits -- HP ==
torque * RPM, right? (OK, more or less, but its good for a 1st order guess)
High RPM means you need stuff that will spin fast without breaking or breaking
the engine case. Low RPM means you have to optimize differently, *AND* that
you may have to put RPM limiters on the engine to keep from blowing it up
if you get rev-happy...  So it's an optimization problem, really...

>Could I reach that kind of hp with my 1.8? I have 40MM carbs and a bursch
>  pipe on it now. It will need rebuilt soon (110K, but still runs strong).

If you have carbs now, then you don't have to worry about emissions questions
or at least, you haven't yet (beware if you live in any about-to-be-interdicted
area, such as much of Texas-- what you can get away with TODAY will be fatal 
in 1995). 

Something else: the cases on these suckers are *IDENTICAL*. 1.7 == 1.8 == 2.0
*EXCEPT* for classes where you need to "prove" you started with a certain
engine, and then the serial number on the case matters. For street stuff, 
a 1.8 is as good a place to start as a 2.0, particularly if you don't have
EFI.

>I've clip the mail I saw from awhile back for those who didn't see it.

This is a frequent topic of discussion. As one of the resident 914 guys,
and as a racing constructor for a variety of Porsche based classes, I
*NEVER* let this go by without comment. So, there is a lot of commentary
to be read.

BTW, the prices you were given in one note are bullshit. A racing grade 
engine will cost you at least $6k, and a full 195 HP 1.8 EProd engine
will be *AT LEAST* $12k. For the street, the best deal I'm aware of is
Elmer Fohey's "street/autox" grade rebuild, which is $750 plus parts.
And parts can add up in a hurry -- a set of high-flow heads is over
$1k (although a racing valve job and some port matching is included in 
his base price), counterbalanced crank is $400, Carillo rods are $900 a 
set, pistons and cylinders are $600 a set, etc. Obviously the higher your
requirements are, the more go-fast parts you need.

>I'd appreciate any feedback.

Hope you mean that...

Subject: success (at least partial)


Well I have achieved a partial success in getting my 77 911S running (for
anyone that really wanted to know).  It was GREAT learning the inner workings
of the ignition system, only to find out it was a loose connection. But,
that IS why I bought a non-running 911.  For the success, after the
ignition and a new fuel filter, I finally got it started and it ran.  The
partial side is that it seemed to run on 90% oil and 10% gas, judging on
the oil that was splattered on the wall behind the exhaust.  I roughly
estimate the amount to about 1/2 a quart.  During this short run (about 30
to 45 seconds) I had the air filter/air box cover off.  After I assesed the
damage to the floor and wall behind the exhaust I noticed there was at
least a quart in the air box (and running out of the corner and down to the
floor).  I understand this is NOT good ;-) but, I would like to hear a
possible reason there was SO much oil in the air box.  Where would it come
from; loose fitting somewhere, missing connection?  Would bad rings cause
this much oil to surface?  I do understand that the engine is probably
history. But, the way I look at it, it provides me with a great opportunity
to break into it without hurting it any worse than it is (again one of the
reasons I bought a non-running one is to learn about more about the
insides of the engine).   Now to my questions; when pulling the engine and
breaking it open, are there any hints, "watch out for"s or "make sure you
do"s that I should be aware of?  And last of all, is it possible to make it
run again (barring structural damage)? 

NOTE: this engine had a major rebuild within the last 2 years and has 15k
miles since the rebuild.  It was running fine up until the beginning of this
year when it was diagnosed to have some bad rings.

Yes, I will get another engine for it in the future, but I would like to
learn more with this one first.

BTW, a BIG thanks to those that helped with troubleshooting the ignition
system.

Subject: $931 Woes

Dear Fellow Porschephiles,

Thanks for all of your helpful comments regarding my questions 
on 931 intercooling and "other than 85 mph" speedometers.  I 
thought I'd bring you up to date on developments with my 
machine.

Following replacement of a ruptured wastegate diaphragm 
(Andial, $100) I decided, upon the recommendation of the Andial 
tech guys, NOT to increase the factory boost without an 
intercooler.  There is no doubt that increased boost will 
create more power from the U.S. spec'ed 931, but IMHO, I feel 
there is a significant risk of having a "hand grenade" under 
the hood without the intercooler (especially with 103K on the 
clock of mine!).  BTW, judging from the response to my question 
about intercooler availability, there does NOT seem to be a 
superabundance of old 924 Carrera GT intercoolers gathering 
dust anywhere.  (On the other hand, it has occurred to me that 
there must be a lot of thermostatically fan-cooled intercoolers 
from Renault Fuego Turbos that could be picked up "for a song" 
in junkyards all over the place.  These are compact and might 
be fitted under the hood of a 931.  Just a thought.)

I did replace the original 85 mph speedometer with a 170 mph 
VDO and seem not to have experienced any calibration problems.  
(I had calibrated the original VDO against the tach in 5th gear 
from 55 mph and up and the replacement seems to be reading 
within a few % of the original).

Finally, after having the car in the shop for more than two 
months and spending more money than I would like to think about 
on esoteric, factory-available-only turbo bolts (@ $50 ea.!) 
etc., it was time to adjust the valves and get on the road for 
one last run before the winter salt trucks appear here in the 
rust belt.  Guess what, $931ers and others interested in a sad 
tale?  A camshaft with the hardened lobe surfaces worn away, 
exposing the soft, fast-wearing inner metal!  Ditto for most, 
if not all, of the lifters!  Oh well, what's another $350-400 
for a camshaft and about $70 each per lifter?  Anybody else had 
this problem?  I am told by a mechanic for whom I have a great 
deal of respect that it's probably not much of a gain to put a 
"hot" cam regrind into a $931 because the original is already 
so "peaky".  Any comments about this?

Best regards.

Subject: '77 911 oil leaking

I haven't had a good look under my car yet, but have noticed that every
time I stop, I am losing several tablespoons of engine oil from two spots
under the engine.  Also, driving around, especially with the heater (if
you can call it that!) on, gives an aroma of burning oil and gas. 

I have not lost a significant amount from driving 100 miles, so I am
hoping that the burning oil is from a leak from the valve covers, and
dripping on a hot surface.  

I'd be interested in knowing if anyone has bought the Anti-Leak Carrera
valve covers on page 129 of the Automotion catalog and/or the expandable
oil return tubes on p. 155 and had any luck with these parts? 

My engine is a 2.7 original from the '77 911S, and has 125K on it.  To my
knowledge, the engine has never been rebuilt.

Also, I'd welcome any suggestions on types of oil (I live in N. Calif.),
and oil/engine additives that might help keep the engine running.

The seller of the car, and from some of the posts here, indicate that I
might want to look for a 3.0 engine rather than consider rebuilding the
2.7, are there inherent problems with the 2.7?  Thanks, as I'm sure these
are commonly asked questions.

Subject: Impressions of driving a 911 and a 968CS


	In my quest to change my 1985/2 944 for something faster, I went to
my local Porsche dealers on Saturday to test drive a 911 (1989 3.2 Carrera
Sport) and a 968 Club Sport, the first time that I have driven either of
these cars.

	First off was the 911, in Baltic Blue, with 46k miles on the
clock. Perhaps I was in awe of the car (after wanting one for so long), or
perhaps it was trying to cope with the offset pedals, or perhaps it was
the unfamiliar road, but I was disappointed :-( I'm quite happy to admit
that the fault was probably more to do with how I was driving it than with
the car itself, but it never seemed to have the "kick in the back"
acceleration that I found in a BMW M5, and it was only towards the end of
the test drive that I discovered that much of the power only comes in at
about 3500rpm. Low-end torque wasn't much to write home about and the
gear-change not very well defined (at least not by 944 standards).

	The 968 Club Sport (*very* yellow, with 5.5k miles), on the other
hand, was instantly familiar (a 944 S3?). The Kevlar seats are very
awkward to get in and out of, but very comfortable once you are in them.
The steering wheel is small, padded and has perfectly weighted power
assistance. The 6-speed box is very smooth and tons of power is there in
both 2nd and 3rd gear (I didn't get a chance to try any high-speed
motorway driving ... perhaps the 911 would have shone here?), though I did
stall it a number of times when pulling away from rest! Porsche have saved
weight by removing everything unnecessary from the car (sunroof, electric
windows, rear seats, coathooks!, etc) along with some they should have
kept (rear wiper). The car has ABS, though. A fantastic car, but just a
bit too easy to drive and lacking excitement - though I never took it
anywhere near the limit. 

	So ... I want a 911 but with the power and handling of the 968CS!
I've got to go and drive another 911 or two, just to make sure that I
wasn't mistaken. But, if they all disappoint, I may well go for the M5
(heresy!) ... or some performance driving lessons!

	Any comments welcomed.

Here's something I posted a while back, hope it helps on oil leaks:

For the 911, the following oil leaks can be fixed with the engine in
the car:

* indicates more commonly seen leak.

*1. Oil thermostat O-ring
 2. Oil pressure/temperature sender seal
*3. Oil return tubes (collapsing type)
*4. Camshaft O-ring/paper seal
 5. Any oil lines
 6. Valve covers
 7. Timing chain covers
 8. Timing chain housing to case <-- not 100% sure about this one.
*9. Front crank seal
 10. Intermediate shaft seal

Cannot be fixed with engine in car (without major difficulty and
perhaps some cutting of sheetmetal):

 1. Case halves leaking
 2. Cylinder to case seal (accompanies broken head stud)
*3. Cam housing to head
*4. Rear main seal

Alright, another Weissach owner!  I've got a metallic black Weissach - is
yours platinum?  Yeah, these cars came with all available options as far
as I know.  I've heard they were meant to sate the American public since
no Turbos were being imported - that's where the tail comes from.  The
alarm system goes off whenever any interior lights go on, or at least it
is linked to those switches, i.e. when my left driver's door switch was on
the fritz, I would sometimes open it with the alarm on, not notice it
since the interior lights didn't light, then as i sat down - WONK WONK
WONK!  BTW, the 'siren' is just the car's horn - no wonder it couldn't be
found.  The keys are easily made at a locksmith's - cost me about $20 and
got to listen to a guy describe being a repo man/bounty hunter and what he
thought of his 911 Targa (wonder how he came by it?).

Other options that were standard on the Weissach:
1. all power accessories, sunroof, heated mirrors, headlight washers (not
sure how many of these had become standard by 1980), antenna, etc.
2. Whale's tail (same as '76 Turbo Carrera I believe - my favorite tail)
3. Custom interior and exterior (colors - interior: Dorian grey with
burgundy piping, exterior [2 variations, 200 copies each]: metallic black
with metallic platinum wheel accents & all metallic platinum 
4. Bilstein shocks 
5. I believe an upgraded stereo

As mentioned above, 400 of these were made, 200 in each color scheme.  If
you need to know anymore, please let me know...

   estimate the amount to about 1/2 a quart.  During this short run (about 30
   to 45 seconds) I had the air filter/air box cover off.  After I assesed the

   least a quart in the air box (and running out of the corner and down to the
   floor).  I understand this is NOT good ;-) but, I would like to hear a

   this much oil to surface?  I do understand that the engine is probably

One reason for oil to enter the CIS airbox is from overfilling. The
oil enters the airbox and also pours out of the oil breather vent
which is located *in front* of the oil cooler (hard to see) and
usually has a little rubber nipple over it. Don't assume your engine
needs a rebuild yet until you check compression and/or leakdown. What
you are experiencing is *normal* for a overfilled CIS engine.

Subject:  RE: 911 security

 ( I originally posted this on 7/20/93, if it sounds like a repeat to anyone )

The factory alarm system for an '85 911 is the "key in the side of the
drivers door" and uses factory controlled keys that are impossible to
replace (I tried).  Only option is a new tumbler (with 2 new keys; ~$75).

After a bonehead event, I'm at my locksmith (Master Grinding, Denville, NJ.)
to get my key fragment removed.  He comes up with a blank that works!
The ID# of the blank that he got to work is YM22...a SAAB key, I think.

It took a second try on the cutting machine to get it right, so it's not
perfectly straightforward, but for only $10, I got the fragment removed
and *three* new alarm system keys.

Non-1985's should be the same if it uses the same tumbler as the '85;
I have no way of checking part#s.  But at only $2/key...what the hey?

Given its vulnerability to human error resulting in a broken key, I wish
that I would have tried the locksmith before I broke the original, as it
would have been easier to make a duplicate had it been intact.  I'm not
too concerned about how it probably hurts the 'concours' value of the car
some far, distant day in the future, but it is a consideration for others.

Subject: 951/944 headlight motor

    I had a problem with the headlight motor on my 86 951 this
weekend.  Start the car up, turn on the lights, there was a
noticeable pause before they came up.  Then I realized they were
not all the way up.  I turned them off (they went up a bit
before going down indicating they hadn't fully opened) and back
on, they didn't come on at all this time :-(.  Tried a couple
more times and could see that the headlights were on in the down
position.  No problem I'll use the manual override.  I get under
the hood, remove the rubber boot, and turn the knob clockwise.
After a couple of turns it pulses back at me, I shut the engine
and lights off and it behaved the same (I didn't remove the
key).  I was able to open the lights by pulling the fuse to the
motor and then rotating the knob.  I haven't had a chance to
poke around with a meter yet.  
	Any advice?  Is the motor screwed or is it something
else?  Thanks in advance for any help.

Hello everyone, this is my first posting.  I've been reading for
a couple of months, and the rennwagen wisdom of this group is quite
impressive.  I'd like to ask for advice regarding my first Porsche 
purchase.  I'm currently driving a 72 VW (I like to call it a Type 60
Porsche :)  but something in me won't stop pining for a real one.  So
far, I have _almost_ bought a '66 911s and a '67 912.  Both times, my
calculator and parts catalogues had to tie me down until I cooled off.
I really regret passing on the '66.  It lived in Yuma, Arizona with the
original paint (badly faded) and about 120K on the original 2.0 (I checked
the #'s)  It ran strong and had no holes.  The seller didn't like the way
it looked sitting next to the new 400SEL in the garage, and he didn't 
know how to sell an old Porsche.  So after it sat in front of the Benz
dealer for about 4 months with exactly one serious offer (mine) he was
willing to take my $6000.  But, during those four months, I had crawled
all over that car and decided I just couldn't afford to own it.  It 
needed everything:  All the turnsignals were cracked (the one piece
kind, ka-Ching!)  All the rubber was crumbly, All the chrome pieces had
dents/scratches, All the leather was cracked/torn, the carpets were 
trashed, the wheels were wrong, the clutch was dying, the torsion bars
were about 26 years old, etc etc.  Anyway, my question is:  can a VW engine
be temporarily installed in a 914 or 912 with no cutting or welding?  
Thanks for your time, Les  kyger@sage.cc.purdue.edu

I think you hit the nail on the head there, my 3.2 Carrera only starts
to rip up the road at around 4100-4200 rpm. I think that to get maximum
thrill factor from an 911 you need to be pushing up towards the redline for each
gear change, this gives optimum torque in the next ratio. It took me
some time to learn how to do this. Fear that I would die in an untimely
but glorious RTA was the main constraint. 

Also, it is somewhat tricky to take a 911 to the limit while test driving
(especially as a 911 novice) as it tends to produce white knuckles and brown 
trousers in the unfortunate sales droog.

Subject: Removing half-axles

P-netters,
        In trying to remove my engine this weekend, the final step in the
workshop manual is to disconnect the half-axles.  It does not say to completely
remove them and the photo shows the axles hanging from the wheels as the engine
is being lowered.  I removed the four socket head bolts that hold the half-axle
to the tranny, but was unable to release the axle.  
        What else do I need to do?  Will the axles slip out as the engine is
being lowered (I didn't think so)?  Do I need to use a little brute force
to knock them free?
        Any help in this area would be appreciated.
Thanks,

Actually, it's a C2 Cab.  My daughter asked Santa for one for Christmas
last year and it immediately displaced the Vette as Barbi's daily driver.
Can't say that I care for the color though.  It kinda reminds me of that
Salmon-colored Roadster seen in the press awhile ago, Yuck!

steering wheel						$ 50

all gauges but tach (as a package, not each)		$ 50

front suspension (no brakes)				$200

rear deck lid (no rust)					$150

rear tail lights w/ lenses				$ 80

the transmission, brakes, wheels, doors, floor pan, carpet, rear seat
bottoms.

If you have a specific part you're looking for, give me a shout. If

Subject: Wierd electrics&slipping clutch

      I have a 73 914 2.0 bright yellow. I have been having some
interesting little problems with the electrics in the car that only happen
ounce so I can't figure out what is wrong. I hoping for ome advice. The
things that have happend are: 
1)All the electrical systems stop working and the car dies. The next
morning everything works fine
2) All the gauges stop working, but everything else is fine. The next
morning nothing wrong
3)Go to strart the car turn the key all the ekectrics work but the car
won't turn over. There is no sound or anything just painful silience. And
again 24 hrs. later everything is working normally.
Any body have a clue to why my car is doing this?

Second question now that it is cold out the clutch on the 914 has started
to slip when the car is cold. After it has been driven for 5-10 miles it
stops.Is this the telling sign of its time for a new clutch or is it just
the way it is.

Thanxs a lot

I was driving down the street and out of the corner of my eye I see a shell 
for a 911 sitting in this feild behind an auto repair place. I drove up to it
check it out it's missing the engine and transmission but it has the heat 
exchangers(at least one) and exhaust system. It is also missing the deck lids
and front fenders. This is how I figured out if it was pre 73 or post 73. How 
do you figure out what year the car is? Also how much would you pay for it.
 This is what it has
shell very little rust that I saw in a quick inspection
both doors
most of the dash(no instruments)
side glass 
recaro seat
part of the transmission(part that the starter bolts to)

what appears to be four new shocks 
3 wheels (not oem i think depends on year)

no apparent crash damage
brake system is there, not sure about the master clynder or booster) the
 trunk was full of parts.

found the owner of the auto store and he said he would try and get a hold of the
owner tonite and see how much he would sell it for. What do you guys think? I
know it will be a long project to get her roaring down the interstates again
but is it worth it and how much is it worth.
 Always dreamed of finding a 356 speedster in a barn or in a feild and picking

I use the expando oil return tubes on my '79 SC 3.0. They're from Imparts, 
though, not Automotion. The seal in the middle is simply rubber o-rings- 
no snap-rings.  I used motor oil to lubricate the end rings (in the head 
and case), no gasket sealer, etc.  The middle seals work fine, a couple end 
seals have very minor leaks- much better than before replacement. I'm 
satisfied until I can do a proper reconstruction (for broken head stud 
replacement- different story). Another leak source was the fitting for the 
external oil cooler line at the case.  I have no suggestions to fix this one.
There have been previous discussions concerning motor oil selection, with 
a partial consensus in favor of synthetic oils.

key blanks and that I would need to purchase a new alarm system lock if I
needed more that one key. I took the car and the one key to an old locksmith
who matched it to a BMW ignition key blank. The key he cut works fine and only
cost a $1.50 or so.

Also, the siren for the factory alarm is located behind the front bumper in the

I have found a problem with my 1986 911 Coupe brake lights. In slow traffic,
depressing the brake peddle with low to moderate force will not cause my rear
brake lights to come on (my wife pointed this out to me when she almost hit
my car while following). I have observed that this model uses two brake light
switches mounted to the master cylinder (hydrolic pressure swiches ?) and a
connecting rod from the brake peddle to the master cylinder. Could someone
answer the following questions:

1. Why a two brake light switches used in this design?

2. Can the sensitivity of the switches be adjusted by adjusting the brake

3. Is this problem an indication of a larger problem with the master cylinder?

Greetings everyone,

I am the person who is selling the 71 911T manual to the netter.
I've been getting a lots of e-mails scolding me not to the manual when
selling the car.

I just wanna clarify something, I agree wholeheartedly that when selling
a car, the manual should go with it. I'll be pissed if I found out the
car I bought has the manual and the owner didn't give it to me.

The reason for me to sell it seperately was that I sold my Porsche in
a used car dealer who lowballed the hell out of me and he has a bad attitude
about old 911s (pre 73). Therefore, I don't think he deserves anything
other than the car and the title. I even took the floor mats.

I rather benefit the netters than giving it to the dealers who is gonna
sell it seperately for five times of what I am asking for.

There you have it.
Thanks for your time.

I used to own a '77 911S with 110K miles and over a couple of years I
tracked down and fixed many sources of leaks. The lower valve covers and
the oil return tubes were two of the first things that I replaced. The
lower valve covers were so prone to leaking that they may have already been
replaced on your car, so I would check first before replacing them. The
originals were smooth, the later models were ribbed to eliminate the
warping tendencies. I'm not sure which expandable oil tubes I used (there
are probably several types available).

Additionally, I replaced all gaskets and O-rings on the chain tensioner
covers (you can do this without removing the chains). Next I replaced all
gaskets and an O-ring on the top front of the engine at the breather
hose/oil thermostat connections. Finally, the engine oil radiator developed
a leak and I replaced it. After all this the engine was *almost* completely
dry - only a drop every once in a while.

Hope this helps.

It seems to me that the leakdown tester at least has the opportunity to
be an absolute measurement, with the units of measurement being flow
(i.e. liters/min., or other similar units). As you say, the flow is dependent
on many things, but a leakdown tester should, in concept, be able to have
the parameters you listed considered in the design, or at least included by
a calibration process, perhaps at a given input pressure.
As you note below, the interpretation of the
leakage rate (expressed as an absolute flow rate) is still application
dependent, but you could at least compare flow readings from similar
engines made with different leakdown testers and draw meaningful
conclusions.

I don't understand your reasoning here. Leakage past piston ring end
gaps is still leakage, and indicative of reduced performance. Why isn't
an absolute measure of total leakage, including piston ring end gaps,
of interest as a measure of the need for a rebuild? Again, the threshold
for a rebuild might be dependent on cylinder displacement.
 
>	When the test is made, the differences between cylinders is the

I believe that racers, and presumably others who track the aging of
a particular engine, use the evolution of the leakdowns of each cylinder
over time as a useful measure, even if all of the cylinders are
uniformly increasing in leakage. I used to do this with my race
engines, anyway.

Do you recall what the Snap-On tester read (in differential pressure, or

Since you mentioned four socket head bolts, these are probably older
half-axles which also have dowels holding them in place (2 I think). 
Between them and the gaskets, I think you just need to apply some elbow
grease.  I wouldn't just drop the engine with them attached - ouch!

This is probably obvious, but you should check to make sure that
nothing is interfering with the mechanism that raises the headlights.
On my car (1983 944), the windshield washer pump occasionally falls
off and jams my headlights.  In my case they usually don't close fully.

Another thing to check is the light switch on the dashboard.  A few
months ago when my headlights wouldn't raise or turn on the dealer

I think a lot of Ferrari owners have access to internet - they

all this chaos at such a favorable price!

I've seen Ferrarri and Lamborghini drivers at Watkins Glenn and
Lime Rock driving schools and they seem to fall into two
categories (neither one technical) those that drive around the
track like old ladies on the way to the market, so they won't
cause any damage to their life-savings-on-wheels, and those who
WILL NOT BE PASSED no matter what the speed of the other vehicle.
One guy a couple of years ago got into a testosterone contest

I'm sure that a lot of "car people" end up driving these cars
too, but as you said, they seem to attract people who buy them
as an icon of success.

Road and Track had an article some time ago about the Rolls
Royce Owners Club and talked about what an ordinary group of
people they all were - of varying means, but all with an 
undying enthusiasm for the marque.

In our local PCA region there is a healthy mix of techies,
socialites, track rats, etc. I've come to respect all of them.
What Porsche needs more than anything right now is sales volume.
That doctor, lawyer or broker who is buying a new 911 turbo 3.8

that he/she can take good care of the car and pass it along to a

A little rubber hammer persuasion usually does the trick.  Once loose,
the "flange" part of the joint that bolts to the trans can be backed

Of course, this assumes you've got CV joint axles, not the u-joint nadellas.

Subject: 911 heater fans

     I was poking around the engine (83 SC) after a turkey dinner
and noticed the "can" on my heater blower motor was loose - not
the mounting clamp, but between the motor and the squirel (sp)
cage housing.  Thinking I would just tighten it up, I removed the
heater blower.  Well, it seems the clips that the two screws
attach to to hold the thing together, are gone.  Rattling along
loose also broke the piece of composite stuff that holds the
brushes.  Perhaps I could fix the composite stuff (epoxy) and
fabricate a couple of clips, so I quickly made a blocking plate
to cover the hole in the "Y" duct resulting from removal of the
fan (to preserve the cooling efficiency of the engine.)

     Driving to work this AM, the heat output seemed as strong or
stronger than normal. Could it be the defective fan was actually
blocking the airflow from the engine fan?  This thing may not
have worked since I've had the car!  To my taste, the heater has
been working fine for San Diego weather, even on chilly days sans
top.  I'm *CERTAINLY* not going to spring $245 for a new one!

     Here's the question - It occured to me that I could clean up
the engine compartment if I could "Y" the ducting to the heat
exchangers at the engine shroud, rather than continuing to use
the stock plastic duct up to where the blower motor used to
mount.  How is the ducting set up on pre '75 cars?  Has anyone
else removed the heater blower from their '75+ engine
compartment, and come up with a sanitary arrangement for the air
ducting?  Is there a pre '75 part that would do the job?

Having backed out all the CV bolts, the CV should be released from the
stub axle in the transmission.  I suppose that corrosion could bind it
in there, but have never seen/heard of that.  There's nothing wrong with
undoing the end at the semi-trailing arm as well, and then just getting
the whole half-axle out of your way.

Unless I'm missing something...

Quick answer: 914 already had a VW engine, so "yes". But I know you 
meant "VW Type I" engine, for which, alas, the answer is "no".
Hmmm, well you *could* have meant "GTI engine", for which the answer
is also no, but the results would at least be more entertaining
(a former list member races a 914 on a dirt track series with a
water-cooled GTI engine bolted up to his 901...odd, but it *does*
work...)

For the 912, the answer is "kinda". You can bolt a Type I engine to
the 901 transmission, but making it work is another matter entirely.
You need a custom machined flywheel, to fit the VW crank with the
Porsche pressure plate and clutch disk. You also no longer have *any* 
engine sheet metal that works -- which means you *WILL* overheat the engine.

But as a stop-gap, it's doable. Just don't plan on (a) using it for
any length of time or (b) using the VW engine for anything else
without a rebuild when you're done with it. Oh, and there is the matter
of needing the flywheel...

OK, gang -- I'm going to be in San Jose the week of December 6-11,
for the Sun User Group Conference and Exhibition (where you should
be, too, if you're a Sun user -- but that's another story).

So, instead of deciding on Thursday that I'd like to get together
with anyone able on Friday 8{), how about some advance notice
this time???

I am free the evenings of December 10th and 11th.  I have a shopping mission 
I need to handle during the day on the 11th in downtown SF, and like to hit 
EASY, Bell Motorsports, and High-Priced House looking for obscure parts, or 
good deals, or something.... but anytime either of those evenings is fine.

I also have some time during the week, but I'd rather save that for 
"special cases" rather than planning a group get-together...

So, do I have a volunteer from the North-Left coast of CA to handle
getting people together? First volunteer gets the job, then I'll let
this go off-line to the NorCal contingent to plan a gathering...

Depending on the year etc, the half axles are held additionally by big
dowels so you may have to pry them off after removing the socket head
bolts. Also, try tapping with a mallet or wiggling them. They will
separate but sometimes they're stubborn.

Subject: Impressions of driving a 911

Phillip,
  Driving a 911 for the first time can be somewhat of a disappointment if
your used to a 944. The 944 is a much better driver right out of the box
where the 911 takes some getting used to.  Driving the 944/968 can be a no
brainer when you want it to be.  If you want some quick 911 excitement, dive
into an exit ramp from the local expressway at about 110 and lift at the
apex :->  Seriously, the 911 does not come to life until you get the revs up
as you found.  For a daily driver the 944/968 is probably a better all
around car but there is more magic in a well driven 911.
  As to the M5, remember, Friends Don't Let Friends Drive BMWs.

I've done several CV joints where they just seem to want to stay on real
tight.  I've
found the easiest way is to wipe them clean enough to see the gasket between
the joint and the gearbox flange, and use a chisel and mallet _on the gasket_.
Just tap away at one spot until you see the joint pull away from the flange,
then rotating the wheel will
cause the joint to pull free.  It totals the gasket, but then, you were going
to replace that anyways, right?
  I also recommend immediately putting the CV joint in a baggy, taping it shut
  around the driveshaft.  There's no easy way to clean and repack the joint
  installed in the car.
  I didn't catch what kind of car you are pulling the motor from, but if it's a
  911,
remove the throttle linkage from the gearbox lever to the engine before you
drop the joints, it gets in the way.

      Here's the question - It occured to me that I could clean up

the stock plastic duct up to where the blower motor used to
mount.  How is the ducting set up on pre '75 cars?  Has anyone
else removed the heater blower from their '75+ engine
compartment, and come up with a sanitary arrangement for the air
ducting?  Is there a pre '75 part that would do the job?

Bob

  The 74 911 uses CIS and has a clean hose setup.  You might want to look at
  changing to that style.  It takes a hose off of either side of the fan
  straight down through the shroud.  You would have to find the air director
  (?) for at least the right side of the fan, if not both.  I seem to recall
  seeing them in Pano.  I'd check to make sure everything would fit befor
  spending any money, but off hand it looks to me like it would.

Subject: Re: 914 vs 914-6

To clarify my questions:

I'm thinking of either rebuilding my 1.8 or building a 2.0.
It will be for the street.
Emissions are an issue but for '74 it's only a tailpipe reading, they don't
  care about original equip.
I'm thinking 130HP would be a good compromise because I want more performance
  but I want to build a reliable, lasting motor.
I was wondering was mods could/need to be done: Stroked, cam profile, etc.
I also don't want to go WAY up because I'd like to keep the rest of the
  car pretty stock. I know when I start adding power other things will
  age faster or show their weaknesses. 
I've seen advertisements for BIG stroked motors, but I don't know what kind
  of lifetime they'd have.
Cost is something I'd like to know. I've read ( and I very much agree )
  you can build it with any 2 of these 3 issues:
  Performance
  Reliability
  Cost
  
I want the 1st 2, in the 130HP range, but I'd like know how much it will 
  cost.

I appreciate your feedback Stan, or anyone elses.

I had a similar problem w/ both my 75 911 and 74 914.  With those models you
simply (!?) adjust the little screw/locknut set-up on the switch.  It can
take a little work to see what you are doing but it's not hard.  The arm on the
switch works against a washer on the master cylinder rod - as the rod goes down
the switch closes.  I have no info on an 86 (I WISH I had one to worry about :-)but it might be something akin to the old style.  Good luck.

Thanks for all the help on the 911 security.  And there seems to be a lot of
interest in the Weissach edition which can hopefully provide me with
some more information about this car I bought a few months ago.  It's in
winter storage now :( so I have the time to think about some of the
details.  I have the original window sticker which lists the following
options for the Weissach series:
	metallic paint (Blaine informed me that Porsche made 200 each of
			black metallic and platinum)
	forged alloy wheels, painted inside
	front- 7JX15 W/ 185/70 VR15 tires
	rear - 8JX15 W/ 215/60 VR15 tires 
	front and rear spoilers
	right outside elec./heated mirror
	power antenna, halogen head lamps
	black roofliner, two rear speakers

My main question right now concerns the wheels and tires. 
My wheels appear to have anocized centers instead of painted.  The spokes
are a kinda bronze color and the rim part seems a polished aluminum color.
Does anybody have any ideas?  Are they definitely not stock?

The other concern is the tires.  The tires on it are
	front: 205/50 R15
	rear : 225/50 R15
This deviation is no doubt the source of my speedometer reading 65 when the
car is only doing 60 mph.  Is there some way to tell what kind of tire I should
put on my wheels when replacement time comes?  What do the numbers mean?

Thanks again for the help.

Paul, I researched headlamp motor circuit operation a few years ago 
(figures, doesn't it?).  Your problem is that you drove the car in bad 
weather over the holiday.  Come on, admit it, you got salt on the car 
didn't you?

Anyway, it sounds like your "up" direction wiring (headlamp switch, 
wires, connectors, motor contacts) is flaky.  It would take a little 
diagnosis to determine the exact problem.

The other symptoms (motor runs all the up, then back down when lights 
turned off) is normal - that's how the system works, as long as the 
"down" circuit is intact.  Call me for further, exhausting details (try 
this Friday/Saturday, I'm in NY).

Subject: re: headlamp motors

Just from the sound of it, your problem may be the rotating contacts
in the headlamp motor assembly. These contacts tell the motor when to
stop running (it's a motor turns counter, essentially.)  There could
be a bad spot on the contact which causes the motor to stop
prematurely... but when you manually move the motor, the contact wiper
again makes good contact and the motor turns.

Repair of the problem involves minor motor assembly surgery and
perhaps (ugh) motor replacement if the contacts are truly trashed.  I
posted a wiper/headlamp motor rebuild procedure some time back; email
me and I'll send a copy to you.

I hope that you can't extrapolate this to the weight of 911 owners. Sadly
my data points suggest a correlation. Must lay off the beer in 1994.

that.

not-so-hot reliability.  Now it's OK, though on long tracks you might 
upset the motor after a period of time.  Dunno about the xmission, but 
the CV's wear a bit faster...

My 217 HP is somewhere around 250-265 now, I'd estimate.

No other alterations are necessary with these chips.  Well actually a 
higher maintenance budget is a good idea.

Ok netters just came back from looking at that car. I took every thing out of
it to see what all was included. Here is what I found

2 wheels  165r 15 one 165r13
all side glass
1 heat exchanger good condition
2 doors good condition
3 window frames (chrome pieces minor rust) 2right sides
rear deck lid minus grill good condition
rear porsche reflector
911 S glove box cover bad condition
Oil filler pipe (I think)
transmission  I think is in decent shape rode that moves gears has rust on it 
2 shafts that connect transmission to wheels  look in good shape (packed heavly 
 with grease)
2 pre 73 rear lights
lots of interior pieces(heater nuts bolts window cranks etc.)
1 chrome hub cap with porsche crest fits 15" wheels
1 door lock
1 post 73 fiberglass front bumper
1 engine mount (forward mount)
1 one sun visor with electric mirror(don't know if porsche piece
looks like it has most if not all wiring
clutch and brake pedal
dash pad black in good shape
steering colume( steering wheel is destroyed, used to be wood)
Hand brake lever
Box of extra rubber(doesn't appear to have been opened before)
What appears to the rubber lip of a whale tail
no rust through except for back right fender
all brake componets minus booster and master clynder
1 recaro seat in decent to good condition

The only numbers I could find on the car where in the front door jam on the
driver side. There was a plack that said made in west germany 
  KAROSSERIE
nr 307066
  KUNSTHARZLACK
   97-6602-L
My german is very very rough so I don't know what this means but I hope some of
you do.

What would you offer for this car, I would be very happy if you could get back
to me by 3:00pm today(11-30) if not he can wait to hear my offer. I know it
will take a lot of time and cash to get her running again but this is project 
I have been wanting to do or at least I think I want to do. I think I can pick
up a 3L engine for $2000 or so from a guy that I know with several laying around
the garage. Can you put this engine in a pre 73 car with little problem and hook
it up to the original transmission(if it is). Sorry this so long won't happen 
again I promise

Not all the symptoms match by any means, but my 914 entered a new world of 
electrical reliability after I replaced the battery ground cable.  Before
replacement, I could see different symptoms from minute to minute, not to

Sorry Henry, I don't agree.  Who are you hurting, the dealer with the bad
attitude who pissed you off or the guy who eventually ends up with the
car?  I think the answer is obvious.  Taking floor mats is one thing.  They
wear out and need replacement anyway.  But not the owner's manual.  Or
the toolkit, the spare tire, compressor, extra keys, etc.

I've noticed that also. is the annual weight gain all the luxo and safety crap?
my 83 944 seemed to handle better than the 86 951, more tossable. how much
for example does power steering weigh? It was missing from the early 83s
and all the race cars. what about A/C? electric window lifts (the RX7 twin turbobo
has drilled pedals AND electric windows).

I did this to my '83 SC, and it definitely sanitizes the engine
compartment... lets you get a good look at that ugly mess of CIS
plumbing hiding behind! :(  Plus you save the 5 lb of blower back there
at the wrong end.  Look around till you find a cheesecake shot of an
early 911 engine bay (I think the "Illustrated Buyer's Guide" has one)
and note the heater plumbing: two tin bits, one each side of the engine
shroud, that duct off some blower air and send it down to the heat
exchangers.  I don't have a part numbers, just went to a Porsche
dismantler and asked and gestured and got something that works.  You
have to re-contour the left one a bit to fit around the later
distributor.  

I find the setup fine for CA and it was even okay back in Massachusetts;
stop-and-go driving in the rain is the only dicey bit... but
that was a problem even with the old system (sure wish
Weissach had invested in decent defroster vents rather than that klugey
tacked-on blower!).  You *will* have to adjust the heater levers more
often, like any time your enthusiasm (=rpm) level goes up significantly.
Engine cooling didn't measurably change (my CHT sensor is on #4) and you
only use the heater when it's cool out anyway, no?

Subject: Cold start problem with 76/911


P-Netters,
 
Last friday after work, my 911/76 2.7S would not start. It cranks
but would not start up. I know the battery is fine, but I ask my 
friend to give me a jump anyway. I kept cranking the engine (while
my friend kept charging) and couple of times the engine started
but die immediately when I let off the gas pedal. Finally after
about 20 minutes of trying the engine come up and I held the pedal
down to about 2500 RPM. Initially the exhaust had white smoke 
coming out, then cleared up after about a minute. 
After reading some literature, I suspect either the fuel system
or the engine is at fault. If it is the fuel system, it could be
the cold start valve (where is this located?) or I need to change
the fuel filter or there is a air leak. However, the car drives
and accelerates great after it warmed up. If it is the engine,
oh, I guess I am up the creek.  Also normally, after the engine
starts, I hear couple of pops from the pop-off valve (due to backfire?)
 
Another problem that could related to the one above is that while
cranking the engine, the starter and the blower continue to spin
even after I turn OFF the ignition key. Is this an electrical wiring
problem? The original owner did put in a different re-built engine
some 30K miles ago. Maybe the installer screwed up in the wiring?
 
Your expert opinion is seek and appreciated.
 
Thanks
 -James

   OK, gang -- I'm going to be in San Jose the week of December 6-11,

   I am free the evenings of December 10th and 11th.
   .... but anytime either of those evenings is fine.

   So, do I have a volunteer from the North-Left coast of CA to handle
   getting people together? First volunteer gets the job, then I'll let
   this go off-line to the NorCal contingent to plan a gathering...

I haven't seen any suggestions go by yet, so while I'm not sure if I'm
exactly volunteering, I will throw out one idea in the hopes of at
least stimulating some discussion:

We meet at the Sports City Cafe in Cupertino on 12/10 for drinks
and/or dinner.

Aw, come on -- it's still motorcycle weather!

Seriously, I'm also interested in sources for 6 volt 356 gas heaters.
Also for US "fresh air" heater systems -- that's one option mine
doesn't have...

In the meant time, I refer you to...

>Also, I'd like to hear any zany

One of the crazier ideas I've seen for a while comes from VW land --
see, you block off your oil cooler, and run a line from the block-off
fitting through the back bulkhead of the car to a heat exchanger under
the back seat. There you also have a fan and some duct work, and
voila! instant heater... Of course, you also usually need another 
heat exchanger somewhere else to really cool the oil, and all other
appropriate plumbing, like some way to turn this off in the summer or
if the Fat Man sits in your back seat or...

Hey! I *seriously* considered doing this to my 914 racer before we
decided to not go ice racing on an asphalt track last weekend...
You can get kits for it -- see Hot VWs magazine.

Subject: Re: how do you tell what year a 911 is

Well, I'll do my best to present some approximate answers  -- I'm doing this 
from memory, so please bear with me (I'm sure others can help me get the
details, here).

First year 911 had the '911' diagonal across the lower-right corner of the
engine cover (I guess I'll call this the 'hood').

If you're looking at a targa, the back window goes from the soft-type to 
glass between the '68 and '69 model years.

I believe it was 1969 when the 911 first got any flair at all to the fenders.

The door handle went from push-button to pull-lever between the '69 and '70
model years.

If you're really lucky, you'll get a '2.2' (for 1970 and 71) or a '2.4'
(for 1972 and 73) badge on the grille over the engine.

In 1972, only, there's an oil filler flap on the front of the left (?) rear 
fender (this should be the same side as the fuel flap, which is on the front 
fender).

The 911 script changed from the skinny kind to the fat kind in the '73 model
year -- and, of course, there's no more 'T' model (I believe that you're limited
to the 911, 911S, and 911 Carerra).  That's also the year that you get the fat 
bumpers and, I believe, the reflector across the whole back that reads 
'P O R S C H E'.  Along with the fat bumpers, the trunk (front of the car) 
goes from curved-over to flat where it hits the bumper.  This is also when the
side-view mirrors went from the small metal to thick body-colored variety.

In 1978, you get the '911SC' with in-dash (rather than under-dash) air 
conditioning, cruise control, and electric windows.  I don't know if the 73-77 
cars had these features.  When do the really wide fenders (the SC style, not
the 930 style) arrive?

In 1984, you get the Carrera.  The fog lights are inset into the valence 
(according to James Fuerstenberg) on the Carrera where they stick-out on the 
SC.

In 1987, I believe, you lose the American-style "fat-boy" headlight rims in
favor of the, IMHO, prettier thin euro rims.

In 1988, I believe, you go from the clear 'P O R S C H E' on the back reflector
to the black name.

In 1990, I believe, you get the Carrera 2/4 and the new-style bumpers.


What am I missing, here?
