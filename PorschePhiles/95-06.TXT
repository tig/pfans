As a water-cooled porschephile, I would suggest that you get it fixed.
Now, before you have a warped head to go along with the gasket.

Also, these things never fail completely at the most opportune time.
Now is the time to fix it...

One thing that you may want to try is double clutching on the upshift.  You
won't win any stoplight drag races shifting this way but the 915 sure seems
to like it.  I gotten into the habit of doing a little abbreviated
double-clutch
on most of my upshifts and have no trouble shifting into any gear at any
speed.  BTW, my 915 gearbox also has about 100k miles on it, has never
been opened up (to the best of my knowledge) and I think it shifts rather
nicely.  (big "FWIW" there...)

Subject: 1988 911 Cab

Well I have found an 88 Cabriolet (it's even black!) that I am interested in, following everyone advice I had it 
checked by a dealer.  Even had the compression and leak-down tests done.

The results were:
165 lbs	.25%
175 	.20
170	.20
170	.20
175	.20
175	.30

According to the dealer these are OK.

They did find LOTS of small stuff that needed attention:
*Top needs adjustment (it is new) and possibly needs seals on window  $280.00 plus parts if needed
*Exhaust leak, needs gasket				        350.00
Cam oil lines "seeping" (not leaking yet)			        265.00
*4 wheel alignment (new tires but wearing inconsistantly)	        120.00  
Deck shocks will need replacment			        120.00
Belts will need replacement				          80.00
Check vlave on windshield washer needs replaced		          43.00
Drivers side mirror does not go up and down ( left right ok)	          85.00 plus parts if needed

* should be done now according to dealer

All told about $1,350.00 plus parts.

Sort of seems like a lot of stuff has not been attended to!  Supposedly they do have records for oil changes 
and other maintenance.

Should I overlook all these items that have been neglected, just use them to get a better price (asking price is 
$27,500), or does this seem like a danger signal?  The car has about 47,000 miles on it.

Thanks for any advice.

Us wabbit wacers have a *lot* of fun in those cars.
Set up right they are great handling cars.  OK, mines
a Golf not a Wabbit.  Racing Rabbits are popular out
here in Portland, OR.  I've had mine at a Porsche track
day and none of the modified street Porsches could pull
away from me in the turns.  Quite a few held me up.  Of
course they all blew by me on the straight.  The only
thing which could corner faster was a race 911RS.

At last month's track day I took my stock 911 out
in the rain so the car would point out all of my bad
habits.  A 911 *demands* to be driven correctly.  My
Golf is so easy to drive it covers up bad habits.
Boy, did I start out driving bad!  It took half an hour
before I was driving the car well.  The next hour was
spent giggling every time the car skated over the slick
part of the racing line.  Then the line started drying
out. :-(  I credit that time in the rain helping me
get my first win in the Golf a week later.

Are the leak-down numbers between 20% and 30% or do you really mean all are
less than 1%?

If the leak-down numbers are really between 20% and 30%, I would run away
from the car. If the number are really less than 1% the dealer is lying to
you and you should run away from the car or have an independant shop check
it out. Leak-down numbers between 2% and 10% are what you should look for.
I would prefer closer to the 2% but this is not likely to be what you will
find out there.

A lot of creativity seems to go into race team names.  C.f. "Watts-Wong
Racing", a Porsche team featuring the oft-discussed Hank Watts, and my
personal favorite, "Piston Broke Racing" (say it out loud), I think they
were a BMW team...

All racing takes two things (1) more money that sense and (2) a car that
you don't mind seeing get wadded up into a little ball of smoking metal,
because that's what you *CAN* get at any event, at any time, through no
fault of your own.

SCCA is also Club Racing, but it's a different club. Alas, they have little
to no place for most Porsches, since all Porsches are really race cars that
hang out on the street. The rules make it difficult to compete effectively
in any of the club classes in any Porsche (but lots of us do so anyway).

As to requirements, it depends entirely on the class, ranging from Showroom
Stock (bolt in roll cage, window net, harness, driver safety gear) to
GT ("all cars are assumed to be of a tubular frame construction...")

There is no class in which the 928 is legal other than in PCA Club Racing.
Sorry.

Subject: 1983 911SC Help

Once again, I humbly come before the Porschephiles gurus asking further 
questions regarding the 911SC.

I really didn't want to be put in this situation, but my toyota celica 
blew up this weekend, something about a cracked block...why did I ever 
have it in my mind to purchase a MR2, 140,000 miles and ka-boom.  Who was 
that person who started the myth that toyotas run forever?

Anyway, the long and the short of it is that I need to purchase a car.  
I've been slowly looking at 911's for about 2 or 3 months, not wanting to 
rush into anything.  However, my hands been forced.  I am willing to rent 
a car for a couple of weeks to keep from buying the next car I see.  But 
I will have to buy one within the next month.

Tomorrow I will be looking at a car that seems almost too good to be 
true.  A 1983 911SC with 68,000 miles, asking 13,500  Second owner (for 
only 4 months, divorce forces sale), the original owner was a mechanic 
and did all the tune ups and oil changes.  The owner, who imports Porsches 
told me that nothing 
else has been done to it except tune-ups and oil changes.  What should I 
expect?  Isn't there a major 60K service that should be done?  Of course 
I will take it to a trusted Porsche mechanic to check it out completely, 
but I just wanted to pick the collective minds of porschephiles before 
looking at it.

One more thing, the owner couldn't really give me an adequate description 
of the paint color.  He said it was the original paint and was a cross 
between Platnium and Bronze.  Any idea what color?  Will it offend?
Thanks, 
Tim

Subject: Re:      Head gasket?...

Yo Sean!

Regarding your smoking 928, the first thing to do is find out where the oil is
being ingested.  Pop off the airbox right after this happens (it will happen
again) and see if there is oil in the airbox.  If there is oil there, it's 
coming from a pressurized crankcase which is forcing the oil up through the
oil supply tube in the pan, past the breather and into the airbox, throttle body
and engine.  You'll need to make sure the breather tube from the "V" of the
engine to the oil cap is clear.  Mine wasn't.  It had collapsed inside and
was blocking the flow of air, pressurizing the case and pumping oil into the
airbox.  Makes for a great misquito-killer (and birds) but not much else.
Mine only did this when I was under full-throttle for several seconds and then
a sharp turn; the autocross guys were not impressed.

If your airbox is clean and has no oil residue, then a damaged or weak head
gasket is likely.  Is there oil in the water?  How does your mechanic know the
head gasket is "seeping"?  Oil leaks?  Water leaks?

later,
bill

The local SCCA folks here in the Pacific Northwest have agreed to
a Porsche-only grid at their road race events. The big difference,
as I understand it, is that PCA club racing and the p-car grid both
abide by the 13-13 rule. I don't think SCCA uses the 13-13 rule (but
I could be wrong, which is why I am asking for correction if so!).

The 13-13 rule says that if the race steward finds you as the cause
of an "incident" you go on a 13 month probation. If you cause an
incident during the probation, you are bared from competing for
13 months. Not sure if an incident would be limited to bent sheetmetal
or if merely running someone off the course would be an infraction.
The idea is to encourage participants to respect the lives and
property (cars) of the other participants.

BTW, I am not yet a racer. I have just started attending driver's ed events
so I can develop my meager skills. Sure is a lot of fun, though!

After installing the 1/2" bump steer spacers under the steering rack of my
'72 911, the steering binds during certain steering wheel positions.
Since I loosened the U-bracket under the access cover in the trunk to
allow the steering rack to move up, I know the binding is caused by the
U-joint under this access cover.  I can loosen the U-bracket that holds
the shaft under the cover and release the tension on the steering column,
but I can't drive the car like this.  To fix this, do I need to loosen all
the U-Joints in the steering column to release the tension, then tighten
everything back?  This requires removing the plastic cover in the trunk,
and the passanger compartment fan.

Be careful with the PreKleano (sp?).  It's great for prepping cars
for paint.  It also *softens* the paint (to give the surface better
"tooth").  I would recommend trying a less agressive product.

Subject: 914 Axle Nut + VW Engine Rebuild Book C

Did anyone suggest using the old gas hatchet?  An oxy acetylene 
torch with a fair size rosebud (about as big as your thumb).  Heat
until cherry red.  If that doesn't loosen it heat again and cool
immeadiately with ice water.  I've found very few fasteners
will stand up to this kind of abuse.  (a new nut is HIGHLY 
recommended)  Use fireblanket and water soaked rags around
non-target parts.  And a firewatch!  Have someone standing
around for firewatch with an extinguisher.  After all, you really
don't want to set your car on fire, do you?

(don't ask me how I know)

Wilson's book, "How to Rebuild Your VOLKSWAGEN Air-Cooled Engine"
ISBN 0-89586-225-5, should be required reading for all flat four 
wrench benders.  The guy has ALOT of good ideas (did anyone mention
the flywheel saddle for your floorjack?  I just caught this thread.)
I don't agree with *everything* he says.  This comes from being
experienced and/or highly opinionated.  It's the kind of book that
Larry Reynolds will ultimately write about car care (given a few more
probing, insightful posts!)

Hi Rich,

The seat bolts are standard 10 mm heads. They can be removed by
a 10 mm thinwall socket (try snapon or sears craftsman) on a 1/4 inch
drive extension with a universal joint.

The 3/8 inch drive is too large to get in there, I agree...

Hi y'all,

If any Pfiles will be at the Ohio Valley Region track event at Putnam Park,
IN this weekend, look us up.  Nancy and I will be in a red 944T, Escort
Series car (you can tell from the Matter roll cage.... ;)  ). We will both be
instructing. The 944T may or may not be behind a dark blue Suburban with a U
Haul trailer, depending on U Haul.   We have the tow vehicle, but not the
trailer. Which leads me to my next question.

We are in search of a two car open trailer, preferably one that lifts one car
partially up, and lets the second drive partially underneath for storage
space considerations.  I've seen on made in New Jersey, but I want to know if
anyone has other leads.  I'm especially interested in manufacturers in the
southeast.  New or used is fine, and if there is a two car tandem tag along ,
with both cars flat on the trailer at the right price, I might be interested
also.

Thanks & see you at Putnam!

they are parts cars or projects or what, but if you're interested I'd be glad
to stop by and check 'em out.  They are located in Manayunk, PA.  One is

	Welp, I looked in the belt "peephole" on the top of the cover
	last night and it LOOKS OK from the outside, but you can't really
	see the toothed part.  The owner's manual recommends checking the
	oil in the hydraulic tensioner at 60K miles - could be that I suppose.
	I ordered a belt mail order anyway for about $40 (amazing price
	differences) and it'll come in tommorrow along with a bunch of 
	other stuff.

	So I've decided not to risk a 5 grand engine rebuild and go in and 
	have my mechanic replace the belt next week for about $400.  I'm
	writing it off as part of the price of the car.  I got it for $18.5K
	which was a fairly good price, less than the $20K they were asking.
	This will give me a chance to ease into learning the car too, rather 
	than attempting probably the hardest maintenance item on there.

	For now, I'm back to the blue bomber (87 Integra with 180000
	miles but still going strong, OK a few rust spots) - what the heck, I 
	can save maybe 20 bucks in gas this week and when I finally get the 
	belt, filters, plugs etc for 60 K service all set, I can REALLY drive 
	it nicely!  


Thanks for the pointer on the belt peephole, btw

>RE: 928 belt tension

Chuck,
Like Clint Eastwood/Dirty Harry  would say, "Do you feel lucky?"  Being an 
S4, allot of expensive head work will need to be done If it breaks.  Mine 
broke once, luckily I have the 16 valve US motor, so no damage other than a 
belt.  Replacing it is pretty routine, but time consuming.  It took me about 
9-10 hours at a leisurely rate, breaking for coffee often and cleaning 
everything really well as I went.  I didn't want to rush it my first time 
through. <g>

Hardest part was torquing the bolt down on the Harmonic Balancer, it takes 
some effort.  You will need to lock your flywheel down to do this or you'll 
just turn the engine.  I think Automotion sells a flywheel lock for the 928 
for around $20-30.

The belt tensioning tool is needed to adjust an S4 belt correctly.  Bruce 
Anderson advised that on the older 16 valve motors you can usually get away 
with adjusting the tension by hand (if you have the feel for it), but not on 
the S4 motor he advised.  The tool runs about $400.

As for replacing the water pump, it's probably a good idea.  I replaced mine 
while I had it all apart.  If the pump goes bad, you will have to do all 
this work over again.  Of course you could get a bad new pump too, but 
chances of that are less likely.

I've heard horror stories of bolts breaking off in the aluminum block, so 
you may wish to use some penetrating oil like PB Blaster (my favorite) or 
Liquid Wrench.  Don't forget to use anti-seize where appropriate when 
putting it all back together for the next time.

Even after you buy the parts and the expensive special tools, you'll still 
be ahead of what a dealer would charge you for this service.

Well after getting a new S-hose and fitting it,  it looks like I have
a couple of questions with which the wisdom of porshephiledom may be able to
help.

The new hose is in place, the leak is gone, but when I run the car the
hose gets pretty hot.  Almost too hot to touch.  Now I suspect that the
oil gets pretty hot, implying that the hose will get pretty hot.  Thus
I assume this is normal.  Can anyone help me out with a "this IS normal" ?

Also,  while crawling around under the car (pretty tough since I'm well
over 6' tall) I noticed what seems to be an "inspection hole" in the
transmission area.  As a novice, I am not sure what this hole is (it might
not even be an "inspection hole") can anyone tell me what this is for ?
If it is an "inspection hole", what am I inspecting, what am I looking for ?

Thanks,

Hi. About your rocker panels: I took mine off (rather Stan took mine off, 
they were so glued to the car that it took all of his considerable power!).
Then I took off all the decals, etc. (with WD-40 helping), banged them 
straight with a good old trusty hammer, sanded the rough spots, and then 
primed and painted them flat black. 3 coats, took no time at all. They 
look new. Used new hardware to put them back on. I then put the 
new little rubber pieces over the jack inserts and it looks real good.

The 944 Turbo was only sold in the US from '86 to '89.  It was sold in
the rest of the world from '85 to '91.  The 924S was only sold in the 
US in '87 and '88.  I assume like the Turbo it was sold in the rest

Go out and watch a weekend of SCCA racing and a weekend of PCA racing.
At the SCCA weekend watch how many cars come off the track broke or
bent.  There *will* be more than one.  As Stan already mentioned you
have to be willing to accept the fact that if you take the car out
on track for *any* event it may come back rolled up in a ball.
Been there, done that.  SCCA racing is very aggressive.  From what
I read PCA racing is much more low keyed but I haven't seen one yet.

As far as "easier to get into", the requirements are on the driver
and both forms have similar requirements.

Wise move.

As a former (sniff :( ) 86.5 928S owner, I'm always interested in the 32 
valve engines.  I had an opportunity to see one out of the car the other day 
at my favorite shop.  Seems the owner had neglected to change the belt @ 
60K, and, stopped at a stop light, the engine died.  That was it.  7 bent 
valves  (ONLY EARLY 928s HAVE ENOUGHT CLEARANCE!)  $7000 later, (had other 
stuff done while it was out) he's back on the road, a wiser and poorer P-car 
owner.

$5000 will cover the cost of the head work, but not a rebuild.

I would spend an extra $40 and have the car moved via flatbed towtruck to 
the shop.  It's an expensive risk to drive it.

Hi all,

	Well first off, I have now determined that my speedo is -not- the
original unit. It's aparently from an early model, and not a 74. Unless of
course the factory had a habit of supplying mismatching gauges to the cars.

	Secondly, I'm starting to notice that under harder acceleration in
1st and 2nd gears that the shift lever is moving under my hand. This
movement seems to corelate to the engine. Is this normal behaviour that I
havn't noticed untill now? Or is this the sign of some mount somewhere that
's starting to go?

	And lastly, my rear window is getting really loose now and rattles
and slaps in the wind. A rolled up newspaper behind my harness bar is doing
an ok job for now, but is there an easy way to repair this myself? If
anyone out there is familiar with this, a step-by-step would be really
appreciated.

They are only available, at this time, from Porsche Motorsports North

amount + $50.00 shipping. Upon receipt of funds parts will be ordered 
from Germany. Parts are shipped withing 24 hours of receipt from Germany.

Rear stub axle nut. There is no Loctite or other similar compound used 
with the nut. The nut is a ONE-TIME use only. Use a new nut if the stub 
axle is serviced in any way. The torque is 362ft-lbs for the ALLOY stub
axle nut only.

The steel arm stub axle nut torque is 268ft-lbs +52ft-lbs (the extra is to 
allow for alignment of the castle for the cotter key).

We tend to use some "adapted" tools for tightening these nuts. Porsche 
makes a special tool that adapts a normal torque wrench to these nuts for 
achieving the proper torque. If you have an accurate tool that 
accomplishes the same thing, use it. This is one area you do not want to

This sounds like bad motor and/or trany mounts.  BTDT.  I replaced the

Mine was the same many years ago....here's what I did:

 - Go to your local automobile windshield supply
place and buy some "black windshield adhesive
stuff for a Porsche 914".  They will look it up in
their book and give you a roll of stuff which has
the correct dimensions (I can't remember the
size).
 - Remove the interior trim around the window
 - Remove the rear defroster wires (if equipped)
 - Remove the window with a SHARP utility knife.
Don't pry the window or force it in any way - it'll
break.  Simply cut away the old "goo" so the window
can be separated from the car.  This may take
a while.  It took me about an hour to remove
a front windshield without breaking it.
 - Carefully clean the window and frame mating
surface to remove all traces of old "goo".
 - Unroll the new "goo" on the frame in the same
place the old stuff was - don't squash it, just gently
press it in place.  It's sticky stuff, so it'll stay
in place.
 - Using a heat gun (paint stripper), heat the
"goo" and the window where it'll touch the "goo".
 - Wearing gloves, and with a friend helping you,
press the window into place by applying a fair
amount of pressure over each inch of the "goo".
 - Enjoy your rattle-free window for many more
years.

I've done this with both the front and rear windows
on my car.

Good luck!

I have exactly the same symptoms at exactly the same rpm. I found that the

        1)  Jack the rear of the car (or the whole thing) up into the air
and support it.
        2)  Put a jack under the engine and take up the weight of the
engine on the jack.  It is a good idea to put a solid support under the
engine as well as the jack.  One place to put the jack (esp. with either the
special VW jack support or a wooden facsimile) is at the engine/tranny seam.
        3)  If the clutch and speedo drive cables run underneath or through
the engine support bar, diconnect them from the tranny end and get them out
of the way.

        I'm told that early cars have rubber mounts on the ends of the bar
and solid mounts from the bar to the engine.  73+ cars are the other way
around--and are the only ones I've done.  The next few steps may need to
be changed a bit to fit your installation.

        4)  Undo the two 10mm nuts holding the rubber engine mounts to the
middle of the bar.
        5)  Undo the two nuts and bolts holding the bar onto the solid
outboard motor mounts.  At some point in this procedure, the bar will fall
on you--be prepared to catch it.
        6)  Undo the two 10mm nuts holding the rubber engine mounts to the
engine.  It helps to be limber for this one!

        Ummm...  "Installation is the reverse of removal."  (TM Haynes).
(Well, it's true, *this* time!)

        You'll want to check the clutch pedal adjustment after you get the
clutch cable hooked back up.  Also be careful when you take the jack out
from under the engine--you want to make sure that the outboard nuts and bolts
are not still loose!
        Remember that you are removing the part of the car that supports the
weight of your engine, and then putting parts of your body underneath that
engine!  Be very very careful because not many people can bench-press the
weight of the engine, and fewer still can do it in the split-second that it
takes for the engine to fall on their head!

        Good luck!

Wayne, man, you're DATING yourself.... These days, Production starts at
"E", there are no higher classes until you get to GT, where you spend
money like no one's business... (figure car plus $45k to show up for Race #1
and only be middle of the pack...)

Besides, isn't the 928 better suited for something like the German
Touring Car Championship? How was it that I described them here a few
months ago -- "rocket sled mated to a Barcalounger"?? Just a wee bit
over the size I personally am interested in pushing around a track...

I'm sorry to say that my car is on the floor. But unconfirmed rumor has it 
that it is in the trailers. (commercials and previews) Either way the $84.50 
(pre-tax) that it was paid was worth the experience.

Rick,

Tail shift or side shift trany?  It makes a difference.

On the tail shifter, it's easy!  The mounts are at the outboard ends
of the engine mounting cross bar.  The other thing to look for here
is that the bracket where the bar attaches to the engine is on securely.

On the side shifter, you'll need to get to the mounts, which, when
I did mine, required removing the fan and fan housing (but, I did
it with the engine in the car).  This is considerable work, but
not unreasonable.

        I did it with the blower and housing (shroud) in place--but
out of the car.  Not sure how much difference it makes.  It was
indeed a b*tch getting the open-ended wrench and/or 1/4" drive
socket on the nut--but it worked for me.
        If you *do* have to remove the fan and shrouding, you'll
need extra tools:  A BIG honkin' slot-head screwdriver to take the
sheet-metal off the front of the shroud, a "CV Joint wrench" (check
your local VW Bug specialty shop, or find an 8mm triple-box socket)
and a 13mm socket and extension.
        Unscrew the slot-head screws holding the sheetmetal on the
front.  Use the CV Joint socket to undo the three fan bolts, then
pull the fan off the hub.  This will expose four 13mm nuts that you
can remove.  Use a phillips-head screwdriver to loosen up the clamp
that holds the rubber air duct from the fan housing to the alternator,
and remove the duct from the alternator.  Then pull the housing for-
ward.  You may be able to get enough space by tilting it outward at
the bottom.
        When you put it back together, follow the torque spec on the
fan bolts.  It would be a *very* bad thing to have them come loose
out on the freeway somewhere.

Opps.  Dave is correct.  I forgot that the big reason that I took 
the cooling stuff off was because of the solid mounts I made/installed
with the grade 8 hardware going through.  (Also, the mounts were
torn in two, but that's another story...)

Take a look before you do this.  Some of the motors don't have the
same type of bolts holding the fan onto the hub anymore.  I've seen
some that all you will need is a 13mm socket with an extension.

Subject: Porsche Model Range

As a recent P-car convert I have been avidly reading about current
and future developments at Porsche. Unless I have misunderstood it 
seems that the future model range will consist of only the Boxster
and the 911 replacement. Two two-seater sports cars sharing a lot of 
components but with different drivetrain configurations. At the risk
of stirring up a hornets nest at best, and being excommunicated at 
worst it seem to me that if the Boxster is as good as it should be
then it should be a 'better' car than it's rear engined stablemate.

I would be interested to know if Porsche ever seriously considered 
continuing with a front engined car, and perhaps making a 2-door
4-seater. This might of course have meant *dropping* the rear engined
concept retaining only the Boxster if a two car range is all that 
could be accomodated. The world is changing and high performance cars
may not always be as socially acceptable in the future as there are at 
present. The future might better accomodate cars with a 'family' image
and a 4 seater P might be better than no P. An old English proverb 
states 'half a loaf is better than no bread!' It seems to me that 
there will be a lot of Stuttgart eggs in a single basket going into
the twenty-first century.

Apologies if this has been discussed previously and to anyone upset
by the heretical ramblings above.

Again I approach the well, greetings!
  My newly acquired '76 2.0 is in great shape BUT, I need LUMBAR SUPPORT.
Recaro makes seats with ajustable Lumbar and can be had for $850+ each.  Are
there any other seats Porsches came equipped with that have this feature, and
will fit into a 914 (bolt in)?  "Dee" makes seats for VW's, does anyone know if
they build them for 914s?  Any other brands I don't know of?  Used is dandy for
me as long as they work.  If need be, I can do any machining to adapt a set.

  Non Porsche Seat Issue- My MB 240D (1979) has seats that died and went to
heaven (horsehair totally gone, springs in my decrepit backbones).  I need my
driver's seat rebuilt with springs repaired, new horsehair pads, and new

will help my back out, but never sat in a young 123 Chassis seat (since last
123 was built in '85).  Any help out there? Has anyone tried putting a late

good way of diagnosing the vacuum limiter? I am pointing at it 
because of the location of a fragment of rubber in the throat of the 
auxiliary air valve, and lousy runability of the car. That is, the 
piece of rubber looked like part of a valve, and the vacuum limiter

Subject: A mountain drive in a Porsche

Well, Memorial Day dawned moderate and sunny, after weeks of
drizzly/stormy/snowy spring here in Salt Lake City.  I ran in to the office
early and crashed through a project that just had to be ready for tomorrow,
came home for lunch, and persuaded my spouse to ride along in the 944 for a
few hours of mountain touring.  She's an artist, and the cumuli were building
over the Wasatch mountains; she thought there might be subjects to paint, so
agreed enthusiastically.

First, we cruised up Emigration Canyon, route of the infamous Donner party on
their way to an appointment with tragedy, and of the Mormon pioneers first
entering the valley in 1847.  Climbing steadily, past historic Ruth's Diner,
the Santa Fe Restaurant (try the rack of lamb and don't forget a margarita or
two, with salt), past Crompton's Roadside Attraction (best hamburgers in a
log cabin yet), we crested the front rank of the mountains slowed a bit by
the hardy mountain bikers climbing the 3,000 feet or so in their colorful
spandex.  Then it was down the smooth, twisty switchbacks to the edge of the
Mountain Dell reservoir.  Then we turned left, and began climbing again, up
to the saddle of Big Mountain, where Brigham Young last camped before
descending into the valley.  (The ascent that took us 30 minutes for them was
a descent of six days!)  We drove to the edge of the parking area, looking
southwest with snowy mountains ahead and to the left, the valley in view
below us, and the Oquirrh Mountains clearly visible across the valley, maybe
30 miles away.

The Porsche was humming, temp in the middle of the band, oil pressure right
where it ought to be, the sunroof tipped up so we could smell the breezes as
we started down the mountain switchbacks headed north.  We ran down the
valley past East Canyon Lake all the way to the Interstate, took a run down
toward Ogden on a lumpy, barricaded single lane, pursued by a hostile moving
van, until we pulled off at Peterson for a soda and enjoyment of the scenery.
 Behind the snack shop, we found a shady spot for my platinum baby, and
sipped our drinks while watching horses munch grass in a lush green pasture,
with snowcapped mountains spread behind.  Here was one of the paintings my
wife sought; photos were taken.

Then we headed easterly down a curvy two-lane, through several tiny burgs,
huge lilac hedges in full bloom, the hillsides teeming with brilliant yellow
flowers amongst the sagebrush.  Soon we were back to East Canyon lake, then
retracing our miles over Big Mountain and down Emigration Canyon.  

Back in our garage, Heinrich II cooled, clicking and clacking and making its
settling-in-for-the-night noises.  I cleaned off the brake dust, closed the
sunroof, and stepped out onto the deck to enjoy the late afternoon beauty of
the valley.  Yes, a lovely afternoon, in a lovely little car.  This was the
kind of day, the kind of road, the kind of loving companion this *sports car*
was made for.  I can't wait for the next time; maybe out to Cedar Valley for
a long fast run where you can see the sheriff coming 20 miles away!

I hope you all had experiences at least half as pleasant with your Porsches
this weekend.  Vroom!

Subject:   Re: 911 Tunes

A solution that worked for me was to get a 
portable CD player that plugs into the cassette
player.   You'll want to get one of the better 
ones though, they skip quite a bit in a firm car
like a 911.   I managed to work around it by 
using a foam insert that ethernet card 5 packs
are sometimes packed in (what a geek!).   Stuck
the CD player in one of the slots and shoved the 
whole thing in the glove box.   Not 100% but
usable.

I couldn't bear the thought of pulling my
CD changer out of my (dreaded) 4x4 and drilling
holes in my 911 to mount it.   Don't care 
about the truck, the drilling holes part is
like nails on a chalk board.

I agree with Uncle Bart, there's lots of other
"music" to listen to and things to observe
but I find that pulling out of the laneway with
something like Sugar's Copper Blue playing puts
me in a good driving mood to start off.

Funny thing though, when driving for enjoyment
the disk replay is rarely pressed...

Go figure.

550 Coupe in 1953.
        I hope this helps the guy with the trivia bet.
        Porsche has won Daytona's 24 hour 19 times, too.
        This also satisfies "why we like Porsche" queries.  Just attend

Yes, this is what I do.  I don't remember why I started doing it, but
probably something I was told or read.  It's cheap enough, and I figured
that if Porsche wanted us to use phosphate-free antifreeze to keep sediment
and calcification to a minimum, then using distilled water would be a
pretty good idea too.

Who is the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          Principal, 
          Technology Tranfer Associates
          P.O. Box 2087
          Bellaire TX 77402-2087

          e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
          voice:  1-713-661-2084 

     His Porsches currently include:  
          '64 356 SC (daily driver)

=======================================================================

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

=======================================================================

Are there any suggestions on how I should submit to the list?

     Beyond using normal good sense and discretion, you can submit
whatever you like that is relevant to Porsches.  You might want to use
descriptive "Subject" lines, including the model number when it is
relevant (e.g., "944 S2 Fuel leak query").  Your submissions would be 
easier for others to read if you make sure that your mailer wraps 
lines of text at 80 characters or less.

=======================================================================

How do I submit administrative requests?

     Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  

=======================================================================

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/archives.
Archives in six subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95) each of which 
has the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan
may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to mail you
archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY
mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program,
or equivalent, to restore to textual format.  Mac and Windows versions
of "uncompress" are available via FTP from /pub/porschephiles/programs.

=======================================================================

What else is available in the tta.com archives?

coffee mugs, stationery, etc., made up.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

=======================================================================
 
Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/porschephiles.  The 
FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

=======================================================================

What about other Porsche-related WWW links?

     There are several WWW home pages related to Porsches.  Stan has 
created an unofficial PCA home page, and has offered to make room for 
additional PCA region home pages.  Contact him if you're interested.  
The PCA home page, listed first below, contains references to all of
the known PCA region home pages.  Here are some other interesting

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions.  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts...

     "In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split."

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state/country of residence, their car's year and model, and
their net address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the
information, and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out
on a monthly basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't
send your Alfa Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send
submissions or changes to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Fund?

     From Bart Chambers, the custodian of the fund: "Here, gentle 
reader and Porschephile, is *The Problem*!  Porschephiles has over 1200
members and generates so much traffic and creates such a demand for
computer and bandwidth resources, that its future is in jeopardy if it
remains dependent upon the *ability* and willingness of any individual
to *donate* them.  In order to ensure the continued survival of
'Philes, we, like PBS, are asking members to donate to a non-profit
fund to be used to acquire the required resources, to be *owned* by
Porschephiles.  This will reduce the load on our beloved Listmeister to
merely backbreaking.  We are asking everyone for a *VOLUNTARY* Donation
for the survival of Porschephiles.  Send your check, made out to
`Porschephiles Acct# 3933150532' to Porschephiles Custodian, c/o Bart
Chambers, 1270 Lavall Drive, Davidsonville, MD 21035.  We suggest $50
for members, $15 for Students and $100 for Patrons.  Thanks."

I want to join the Porsche Club of America; what do I have to do?

     The following comes from Judy Hendrickson, Chairman, PCA National
Membership Committee (DH993@aol.com):

     "PCA membership is unique among car clubs in that the criteria to
become an Active Member includes ownership of a Porsche.  This is
apparent when you see a membership application and there is a blank to
fill in the VIN.  I know for a fact that "speculation in VINs" for
acquiring membership in PCA is not new.  We have a 35-year member who 
admits his original membership was based on a 10% share in a car! 
Innovation I have witnessed includes "loaning" a VIN number to a 
friend who wants to join so he can do his first Porsche shopping.  
Using a VIN from a car acquired by a PCA member who joined with 
another, earlier car's VIN, and I'm sure some people have just made 
up a number!  Also, once you have joined PCA and are in between 
Porsches, you can remain an Associate Member, as long as you continue 
paying the $36 dues each year.  Application for Associate Membership 
can also be made by "...any person, employed by a Porsche-oriented 
business, interested in the Club and its objectives, having paid Club 
dues and fees as required."  Associate Members cannot, however, vote 
in National PCA Elections or hold National Office.  Requests for 
Associate Membership must be done through a local Region's Membership
chairperson, to verify their relationship to a business.  If you need
to be put in contact with your local Region's Membership Chairperson,
send me a note including your ZIP code.
     "The $36 annual dues (Active or Associate) not only includes your
monthly subscription to *Panorama*, but an annual payment of $12 per
member to your local Region.  Other subsidy payments to the Regions 
may also be voted by the National organization."

     Additional PCA membership information (courtesy of Stan):

     The Club affiliates you with a local region based on where your
ZIP code falls on their territory map.  You *CAN* request to join a
specific region, and you can specify an affilate region or dual
membership in another region.  The local regions put on many different
events, some social, some educational, some driving or compeition
oriented.  The annual gathering of the whole membership, the Porsche
Parade, features competition for the national championships in many
events, seminars, a GREAT goodie store, and one of the most fun weeks
you'll experience.

     Once you have a VIN number, there are four ways to join:

     1) Send a letter to the national office saying that you want to 
join, with your name, address, car info and a check for $36 to:

	Porsche Club of Americia.
	P.O. Box 10402
	Alexandria VA 22310

     2) Call them up at 1-703-922-9300, roughly between 9:00 to 5:00
EST (GMT - 6).  If you have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number
handy, you can do it over the phone.  (Otherwise, they'll send you an
application which you can mail in with your check.)  This is the FASTEST
way, and if you need to be a member *RIGHT NOW* to go to an event that
is members only, this is your best bet.  Don't count on using this
method the week of or before Parade...

     3) find someone active in your local region.  *MANY* of the regions
are represented on the Porschephiles list, so that's a good place to
start.  Once you have found someone, get them to put you in touch with
the local region membership chair, they can give you the form, and off 
you go.

     4) National membership chair Judy Hendrickson is reachable as 
DH993@aol.com (see above).  She'd be happy to help you out, as would
Nann Weissenberger (NannW@aol.com).

=======================================================================

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     If you own a North American Porsche, Porsche Cars North America 
will, for a fee of $20, research the original bill of sale for your car
and give you a Certificate of Authenticity stating the facts and 
figures for the car as it was delivered to the dealer.  If you're 
interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  A similar service is
available in Great Britain from Porsche Cars Great Britain, for about
30 pounds Sterling.  Porsche AG can also perform a similar search.

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

=======================================================================

What are the model numbers of cars related to the Porsche name?

     The following list was extracted from _Illustrated_Porsche_Buyers_
Guide_, _Porsche_Specials_, _Cars_Are_My_Life_, _We_At_Porsche_, and
the article "Project Porsche, The Early Years" in the June '83 issue of
_Thoroughbred_&_Classic_Car_.  It includes only more or less complete 
automobiles designed by Ferdinand Porsche or by the Porsche factory.  
Components (engines, transmissions, etc.) have not been included.  
The list is incomplete, in part because there has apparently been 
imperfect record keeping at the factory.  In addition, the nature of the
list has changed over the years from an in-house listing of project 
numbers to a market-driven listing.  Additions and corrections are 
welcomed:

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What references are available for information about Porsches?

     There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for 
you depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

     The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the 
technical articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of 
their Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's 
executive office.

     What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  If 
you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note: there's 
not much information about water-cooled cars; those with favorites

Should I use an oil additive in my Porsche engine?

     This is Stan's response:  "Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil.  Or as Bruce 
Anderson commented about something else, "a cash flow device."  Slick-50
is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case.  Guess what we 
all have, eh?  There is a bit of info on it via anonymous FTP in tta.com
in /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo.  Additionally, many of these additives 
use teflon.  DuPont (the inventors of Teflon) have stated categorically 
that teflon is useless in such applications."
 
=======================================================================

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other renowned Porsche people) here?
 
     Yes. There are many luminaries in the Porsche world on this list.
If something is relevant to them, they'll typically respond to you
privately.  Their participation is greatly valued, so respect their
privacy and don't try to draw them out in the open.  If they want to
say something to the list as a whole, they'll do so.

     The FAQ is maintained by Walt Thode (thode@nprdc.navy.mil).  I have
a 1972 911T as my daily driver.  Anyone who wants to contribute should 
do so.  Contributions, revisions, and suggestions for new items are 
always welcomed.  I peruse the list for potential additions, but I don't

about sending suggestions directly to me, or to the maintainers of the
model-specific FAQs in the tta.com archives.  Also, don't expect me to 
know anything about those model-specific FAQs -- this one is my only

It's more likely that you are pushing a little coolant into the combustion

How timely you should ask this. After recently refilling my '86 944 rad
with 50% regular (aluminum compatible) Prestone and 50% distilled water, I
wondered about corrosion.  Would using this cheapo (phosphate loaded?)
antifreeze really make a difference? And what about using distilled water? 

I decided to do a little experiment. I polished a small sheet of 
aluminum, washed it with a solvent, and cut off 4 strips. I placed each 
strip in identical jars which had been cleaned in a laboratory. I filled 
each jar as follows:

1. 100% distilled water
2. 100% tap water
3. 100% Prestone
4. 50% Prestone, 50% distilled water 

That was May 19th. Today, here are the results so far:

1. White precipitate (flakes) coating the top surface of the aluminum.
   (looks almost like 1 mm specs of dandruff) There are also flakes settled
   at the bottom of the jar.
 
2. About 1/4 the precipitate of jar 1. The flakes are much smaller, almost
   making the water look cloudy rather looking like they are in suspension.
   Also visible are small gray specs of corrosion on the aluminum (not 
   visible in jar 1 perhaps due to the thick coating of flakes).
 
3 & 4. No discernable precipitate or cloudiness. Aluminum surface still as
   satiny as when first polished.

So jars 3 & 4 proves what we all know already, that antifreeze prevents 
corrosion. Only time will tell whether my use of an antifreeze which 
probably has phosphates will make any difference. Unfortunately, I don't 
have phosphate-free antifreeze to use for a 5th jar.

However, jars 1 and 2 behave the opposite as I would have expected. Any 
chemists out there to explain why using distilled water produced more 
precipitate than tap water?

Subject: Rev Limiter

Hello Folks,

Those of you that depend on your electronic rev limiters beware.

I recently repaired a set of 911 heads from an '82 euro.  I replaced the 
exhaust valves and guides.  Intakes were fine.

The car was recently purchased from one of our local (Springfield MO) used 
exotic dealers.  (They advertise in Autoweek & Hemmings)  The new owner 
took it to Branson MO at a high rate of speed.  He steered onto the off 
ramp and shoved it into a lower gear 1st or 2nd I'm told.  His complaint 
was the engine stopped running and would not restart.  The mechanic 
called me asking why this engine would not have any compression.  I told 
him to put air pressure into the spark plug hole and listen for the 
escaping air.  

The engine continued to rev even though the ignition cut out.  All of the 
exhaust valves hit the pistons and bell shaped the ends of the guides.
The engine would not restart because it had no compression.

Don't depend on your rev-limiter to replace common sense.

Subject: Monthly Update, June 1995

June 1995

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

Wow. The last two months have dwarfed anything I've had in a LONG while, all 
the way back to when I was hitting consulting gigs in 4 different cities a 
week... *BUT* things are looking up. I can't say more just yet, but there's
a very major change coming that I've worked a long LONG time for...

Don't worry, this will be one of the first places to get the announcement.
If you miss it, don't worry, it'll make the WSJ, etc...

Bart Chambers continues to fight for truth, the American Way, and the
establishment of the Porschephiles Foundation. If you haven't sent
him a check and can, please do so. If you have no idea what I'm
talking about, stick around, Uncle Bart will be around shortly with
the collection plate...

List membership continues to climb, hovering in the zone between 1500 and
2000. Speaking of such things, I've been VERY busy, so requests are no
longer guaranteed to be handled on a daily basis. I'm doing good right 
now to get to it every other day. So if you want an add/move/change,
don't get all upset if it's not happening in real time. *NOTHING* is
happening in real time right now...

COPYRIGHT AND FAIR USAGE STATEMENT

The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence by and between
members of a closed community. As such, the copyright for EVERYTHING that 
ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 18 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

FINAL NOTE: As I noted in a prior mailing, the FTP restriction above applies 
to major downloading of stuff from the archives, not WWW access. Suggestions 
for improving the WWW pages would be welcomed, as well as experienced help
in doing so.

CLUB-INFO

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 if you have to.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Subject: Re: Rev Limiter


Hmm. It's my understanding that Porsche's "under load" qualification
for the rev limiter's behavior actually means simply that you can't
get it to go past an RPM brick wall _using the throttle_. On the other
hand, downshifting can't possibly be guarded against without a very
large piece of extra machinery, essentially a brake on the engine
itself. Common sense, indeed!

Subject: Subject: name that Boxster


Hi, all,

   I believe the commonly acknowledged designation number
for the Boxster is the 986.  At least, I seem to remember
seeing that in some auto mags, and that is what is in Walt
Thode's FAQ.  However, during my recent visit to the factory,
I could have SWORN the number used on the various Boxster
parts was 886.  I know that seems weird, but that is 
what I remember.  I even double-checked it with my SO, 
who doesn't share my praeternatural bias for numbers
that have the form "9xy".  She said, unprompted, that she thought
it was "886 or something."  When pressed for the "8xy" vs. "9xy"
she said that she was pretty sure it was an "800" number."  What
gives here?  Did Porsche go back to the future, or did the missus
and me have a few too many Stuttgarter Pilsners??

 TIA,

Subject: torque wrenches

I'm gonna get myself a torque wrench (manual variety) to
work on my 911SC (there's the only Porsche content).  I
haven't been to the h/w store yet, but I checked a coupla
catalogs I happened to have lying around and was stunned
by the variation in price.  Griot's has a FACOM wrench for
more than $300 and an Amurrican one for $165.  Performance
Products has only one, but it's $32.95.  Hmm.  That's about
an order of magnitude difference.  I know you get what
you pay for, generally speaking, so I'd be willing to bet
that the $32.95 one is pretty cheesy.  But is it worth paying
more than $300?  I don't plan to put it to very hard use.

Before I go down to Sears or OSH, does anyone have any
opinions or advice to offer on what a good quality manual
(as opposed to compressed air powered) torque wrench should
cost?  Any testimonials or caveats?

Thanks for any suggestions (besides "get a life" 8^))!

I visited the factory a month ago.  I think it will be called 986 as I believe
our guide said us, but we didn't saw any parts of it.

If you're right, it will be a great `marketing' event.  Maybe Porsche wants to
split its production into two different lines of cars.  A 8 serie at the entry
level and a 9 serie at the upper level.

An another to show that the Boxster is not a wanna-be 911, but a real different
sport-car.

The next 911 should be called 996.  Even if it has been debated to death in the
past, I'm still wondering about what they'll do after the year 1999 ?

Dear Paul,

I bought a torque wrench from Imparts which probably compares with the
PP one.  The price when I bought it was lower.  Don't see it
advertised in the Imparts ad any more, but they probably still have
it.  With PP you pay both shipping and tax if you're in CA; Imparts
used to be free of shipping charges if your order was over $45, but
now it's a flat $3 on every order, no tax.  My only complaint about the
Imparts wrench is that the case (the only thing cheesy about it)
doesn't have room for the soft socket I bought for my lug nuts.
Otherwise it does the job.  The other wrenches are most likely better,
but five to ten times better?  I doubt it.

I'm not sure about the numbering system these days (since Porsche seems 
to keep pretty tight security on ideas and numbers, unlike some 
companies) but I would say that it is very possible that 886 is the 
testing stage car, I don't know if you've seen it or not, but it is the 
black one, with the working roof that looks like a mangled Miata with 
vacuum cleaner attachments on the side... not that looks matter, that car 
is a test of the engine/transmission and roof.

	Made the hour and a half trip to check out a '76 914 2.0 last night.
The seller (who shall remain nameless - he is a car salesman) told me the car
was perfect except for one small surface rust spot - I should have known better.
	The body was beautiful - the interior was perfect - it looked awesome
until I saw the "surface rust" right below the sail panel (what are the odds
of finding rust there??!!  :)    )  Further inspection revealed more bubbles
along the rocker panels.  

	A quick drive down the hiway revealed a spongy suspension and horrible
brakes (even compared to my 1,000,000,000,000 pound Audi Quattro).

	The worst was the seller's list of receipts.  The engine was supposedly
rebuilt 8,000 miles ago.  A lot of white and blue smoke for a new rebuild.
The famous Porsche "leaky engine tubes" were also shot.....  see oil covered
heater boxes for further proof.

	Asking price was about $8,000 - he'll probably get from someone who
has no 914 experience - the car looked and sounded great.

	Oh well, the hunt for another 914 or 911 Targa continues.

My 1990 928 has a separate intensive windshield cleaning system which you

 The stuff works but is very expensive at $20+ for a small container at my 
local dealer.

I cannot determine the contents from the packaging but can anyone suggest a 
cheaper alternative?

The liquid is quite volatile, as a leaking tank gasket, where the pump 
enters at the top of the reservoir, accounted for evaporation of most of my

> -Ed Mellinger

    Sean, I agree with Ed; this is too cheap ! Forgetting the cost of the
 parts, removing the head on a 928 is a nightmate job (well, actually getting
 the head off is easy; its getting the cam towers off thats hard). Unless your
 mechanic has done a 928 head before, and if you value whatever relationship 
 you have with him, to be really decent you may leave your final price "open" 
 and rely on his generousity in billing....or by the time its over your 
 mechanic will shudder at the sight of you and your car when he is done.

      I don't know which year the change was made, but at some time the 928
  changed from "hidden" allen head bolts mounting the cam towers to ones
  that come flush to the outside of the towers. If its possible, I'd 
  definitely change the fasteners to the newer style so that its easy to get
  your head off in the future. Getting any of these off (upper or lower) is
  -THE- pain of the head job.

     Parts costs are going to run higher; a head gasket is about $40
 (I can't remember if the cam tower gasket is reusable), but then you'll need 
 about 8 rubber plugs to refill the access holes that in the cam towers (I  
 think about 8 at $5 each). If you are lucky, you will only need need 4
 intake/exhaust gaskets more, but likely you will break those custom
 German plastic hoses (gee, I think new cars use rubber instead of that
 brittle plastic :> ). Likely you will also have problems with frozen or
 broken allen-head bolts on the way out.

     All this is a mess and will probably cost closer to $500 than $150.
 But if you have anything marginal, fixing it quickly (and treating your
 mechanic fairly) is by far your cheapest alternative...

Subject: Update - 944 Puzzler Solved

Since I only got one response to my previous post (thanks, Trevor), I post
this message with some reservations.  However, we have found a solution to
the surging/anti-surging 1983 944 with a whining fuel pump.  Perhaps this
message will save you folks a few bucks.

I thought for sure I needed a new fuel pump.  The engine was obviously
burning extremely rich.  The pump was whining like Holly Hunter and pumping
at about 140 lbs of pressure.  In fact, I was just about to ask my mechanic
to order one, when he suggested trying the fuel pressure regulator first.
It worked.  The car runs better than ever now with a relatively cheap part.

The mechanic shared a story with me of a similar problem that he
encountered.  The owner of a '84 944 pulled in his car and asked the shop
to replace the fuel pump.  He told them that it was whining and that he
needed a new one.  Well, I'm sure you know how it turned out - he broke
down about 20 minutes after leaving the shop. Fuel pressure regulator.

I'm told, however, that this is not a typical malfunction.  In the 15 or so
years this guy's worked on Porsche's, it's only the 2nd fuel pressure
regulator he's done.

Moral of the story:
1) Look at the whole picture when you're dealing with Bosch FI System.  (ie
a whining fuel pump may not necessarily be a bad fuel pump.)
2) Get yourself a mechanic who's seen a few Porsches.  On the atypical
problems, there's no substitute for experience.

    Hey, I'm proud of being anal about my car... but I've heard that you

Subject: Re: Distilled or Non-Distille...

No, you are not being AR, I believe it is officially recommended that you use
distilled water. Not so much from a corrosion standpoint, you will still need
corrosion inhibitors, but to prevent scaling from hard water impurities. 

I run distilled water with Red Line "Water Wetter" which improves heat
conductivity and also (recently added) has corrosion inhibiters in it. A
little anti freeze is also useful as it will raise the boiling point as well
as lower the freezing point of the mixture.

If you plan to run on the track, you will be loved by all if you eliminate
anti-freeze from your system and replalce it with distilled water only. Anti
freeze is worse than oil on the track surface and can cause long delays for
mop up in the event of a spillage.

Note also, that anti-freeze does just that, by adding glycol to water you
raise the boiling point (which is why we still use it in summer) and lowers
the freezing point. But it also LOWERS the heat dissipation capabilities of
your system .

How about a quick sanity check?

Front brake pads are, what, $50.00?  Certainly less than $100.

The cost of repairing the 911 after you've had to romp on the brakes
because some LOL in a Volvo station wagon decided to STOP to check
traffic on an otherwise empty freeway on-ramp, and your 911 took off
sideways because the brakes grabbed funny, and you got some assistance
stopping from one of the majestic oak trees along the shoulder.....

What I'm trying to do is point out that brakes are IMPORTANT.  Don't
risk it by trying to save a few bucks.

My 2.4S cams are worn and pitted, looks like the shiny finish 
on the lobes is worn off in spots. Maybe they were reground poorly?

Anyway, I would like to repair or replace these cams to get some
performance back (I need it to keep up with 993s!)

Does anyone have a GOOD set of MFI S cams for sale?

Anyone know a reputable shop that can get these cams back up to
factory S specs in a short time?

Regards, Mike Piera '72S and '73E (sold?) Targas, '73 914/2.0 (?)

  As a 911 devotee for 10 or 12 years ('72 S Targa & '88 Targa) I have had 
my senses attuned recently to replacing my '88 Carrera, destroyed in a house 
fire, with another 5-7 year old 911.  During this time I have somehow had 
"blinders" in place as far as my exposure to the 930 model p-car goes.  I'd 
like to correct this deficiency.

   I would appreciate any input from those of you with knowledge about the 
930 series to educate me about its pros and cons, especially as they relate 
to the 911.  Could you also give me an idea of what a '86 930 turbo cost 
new?

   Thanks for your time.

It has to do with a thing called the KSP.  What is happening is that
the Al is dissolving in the water.  The reason that the tap water
looks better is that there is already a lot of metal dissolved in
it; it can't dissolve that much more.

One of the reasons for distilled water is so that YOU have control
of what metals are dissolved in the water.  Certain metals are less
soluible than others, and will be exchanged for the more soluible
metal in your engine.

Then again, what is water doing in your motor anyway?  <flinch>

I recommend Illustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide. It covers EVERYTHING, even 
different model numbers for engines, trannies, and concept cars! (not in

Well I tried everybodys suggestion of double clutching and it works.  
It does slow down the 0-60 times but it stops that grinding noise.

Is it really true that 1-2nd syncro's go after 10K?  What kind of

and looked at.  My guess is that just taking the transmission out and 
opening it up would be the majority of the cost.

Subject: Re: 914 down in FLA

Dear Darrin:
I stopped at Specialized Motorcars this afternoon to look at the 1976 914 
you're interested in.  Here's what I found:

BODY

Original lime green, now red.  Paint job is below average.  I don't 
believe that they used primer between colors (I could be wrong about 
this).  I didn't find any major accident repair.  Car never had A/C.

Front Trunk - Front torsion bar mounts badly rusted.  Entire front trunk 
coated with black undercoat.  Otherwise OK

Rear Trunk - Painted red (including wiring harness).  No rust detected.

Bottom - Outer rockers seem to be OK, inner probably OK, but you must 
remove the outers to be sure.  No rust or other damage noted.

Engine Compartment - Also coated with black undercoat.  Battery bracket 
badly rusted.  What I could see under the bracket seemed to be OK, but 
the salesman didn't have a flashlight handy (of course), and we couldn't 
move the battery.  The battery was held in place with a U-shaped bracket 
screwed to the sidewall, pushing down on it.  There didn't seem to be any 
other rust in the engine compartment.

Passenger Compartment - No rust under seats or on floorboards.  Otherwise 
average interior.  Plastic dash cover glued to dash. Alpine stereo and 
speaker upgrade with door speakers.


ENGINE & TRANS

2.0 litre with original fuel injection - smog pump removed with a lot of 
loose plumbing left over.  Probably could use some new vacuum hoses.  

Shifter is very sloppy.  I'm sure that new bushings would help a lot.  
Third gear synchro is probably shot, but it could be a linkage problem.  
Maybe someone else can comment on this. Other shifts were OK, so it's 
probably the synchro.  

DRIVE

Car runs fine.  Engine has power and doesn't smoke (of course this 
observation is no substitute for a mechanic's inspection).  It sure is 
hot down here without AC.  Salesman said that he has been driving it 
every day to his home in Miami (about 30 or 40 miles).

CONCLUSION

I certainly would not be happy with this car for 6K plus $800 shipping to CT.

Any questions, call me at the office - I'll be here Saturday morning 
305-755-1993 extension 600

or at home tonight before 11:30PM 305-345-8089.

Subject: 968/944/924 Rest In Peace?

Can anyone confirm the truth of the death of the 968/944/924?  I have heard
from two p-filers that just toured the factory that one- the last 968 has been
built or two- Porsche is making one or two 968 a day?  What is the official
word if known?  We should have a nation minute of silence in respect for the
passing of such an important part of our auto heritage or better yet maybe
Porsche will realize it's mistake and find a way to continue it's water cooler
line.  I personally can't see the big deal of having a new line of 2.0 liter
rag tops starting at $40,000.  My first two cars were rag tops a Sunbeam
Alpine and  a Fiat  124 Spyder (which I still have) so I know the fun of such
cars but for a Porsche I love the 968 (which I also still have) looks/feel etc
etc.  I don't think Porsche's problem is the 968 cars themselves and I fear
that the 986 isn't going to solve it either.  

I guess I'm a little p#ssed off because I took my 968 into the shop today to
get the AC fixed-bad switch and have the valve cover gasket replaced-all under
warranty and I was told after I got there that I would have to leave the car
for the whole day.  This is the second time I took the car in and they knew I
was going to be waiting for the car while the repair was done.  I should have
at least been told beforehand that I would need to leave the car for the day. 
It turns out I had to rent a car or wait 8 hours till they finished.  I live
an hour and a half away so it's a real pain having service done.  Since it was
warranty work I guess I should be  happy that I did not have to pay for the
fix but a lot of car dealers give you a loaner car since you are deprived of
the use of your car for the day due to "their" fault.  If Saturn can do it why
can't Porsche?  A nice new Turbo would have made my day and think of the good
will they would create.  I might just have my car serviced weekly?  Enough
bandwidth.
Thanks for the vent.

Well, I've the same problem on my 86 Carrera, but since it's only when 
shifting to 1st, I can live with it.  My local P dealer want's $1088 for 
labot plus parts.  Incidentally, I didn't have this problem with my 81 or 
82 SC and both never had the transmission rebuilt.  I'm a bit skeptical 
as if 10K is really a resonable estimate as both of my older SC had over 
70K on them...  Comments?

Subject: Torque wrenches


My first one came from Imparts about seven years ago; after a couple of 
years of decent service, it would suddenly slip at 90+ft.lbs, just when 
tightening those lug nuts on the wheels, with the result that the air would 
turn blue from the foul language, the latter resulting from the smashed 
knuckles on your right hand. After about three vituperative outbreaks over a 
span of one year, at which point I was contemplating driving with loose nuts 
in preference to smashed knuckles, I got an Armstrong from a San Fernando 
Valley tool store (General Industrial) model 64-066, cost $135.31 (in 1992) 
and have been delighted with it, as well I should be at that price.

Like the Imparts one, it's a clicker type and goes up to 120 ft.lbs.  It 
includes metric calibration, albeit on a non-linear scale, the primary scale 
unfortunately (at least for P cars) being US.  the only problem has been 
that the rubber handle started to slip off a few months back, easily 
remedied with some glue.

While I would recommend the tool, I think the Home Depot alternative 
mentioned earlier is probably the way to go.  While Griot's catalog looks 
like it has some fine tools in it, the prices are unrealistic, and there's 
so much badge engineering going on now I wouldn't be surprised if the HD one 
was the same thing.

By the way, I bought Griot's soft jaw channel pliers and cannot recommend 
them.  While beautiful to behold, the curve of the jaws and the wide closed 
gap to severely limit the tool's use.  Also, the polyurethane (?) jaws are 
too slippery for most purposes.  The one really great tool they sell is the 
ratcheting box spanner - ideal for fiddling with belt tension on my 928 
('belt' as in alternator, smog pump, etc, not as in cam!).  Try that why 
lying on your back with an open end wrench....

  Imparts offers 2 different sizes of torque wrenches, a 1/2" & 3/8" drive.
  I have both & they have given me good service for a very reasonable
  price.  I use the 3/8 drive for installing spark plugs & the 1/2 drive
  for lug nuts, CV joint bolts, front strut upper mounting bolts, etc.
  These may not be durable enough for every day use in a shop, but for the

Paul-
For the kind of home wrenching you're talking about, buy
the Sears wrench.  I'd even recommend the torsion bar type.
They're cheaper, they don't go out of calibration, and they
don't break.  In a shop where a tool ius used every day, and
time is money, this might not be the best solution.  But for
those of us who use it a few times a year, so what if it takes
two minutes longer, or if it's handle isn't silky smooth.

I think they cost around $20.  Thing of what you can get with
the $280 you saved!

In my view Porsche's are race cars period.  I think BMW does an

Subject: Re: 542 again

Hello all,
A bit of background as I know it on the 542, maybe those more knowledgable
in Porsche history could correct me.

Probably because some Studebaker family members with lots of
relatives in Germany still sat on the board
of the Studebaker Corp, and because  the Marshall Plan to help out Germany was
underway, the Studebaker Corp became involved with the German auto 
industry after WWII.  Volkswagon of Canada and Mercedes of North America were
started as divisions of the Studebaker Corp.  For the '53 model year Studebaker
wanted a 'continental' look.  Design contracts went out, one being to
Porsche for the design of a sedan (saloon).   A prototype was built called
something like the 630 or 633.  From this first design a production
design evolved called the 542.  Now I had thought this was maybe just a 
prototype.

A fellow I met here, now deceased, worked at South Bend at that time 
and knew about the Porsche project, he said he worked in 'experimental' as
a toolman.
He said there was a small production run in '52 for testing.  He didn't
recall which parts were made in South Bend or Germany, but
the assembly was done in South Bend.  He thought the cars went to the
factory engineers for testing.  He did not know whatever happened to them
as the project was discarded when the Loewy design for '53 was adopted.

Anyway, I thought it might be fun to have one of the 'US-built Porsches'.
Also curious he said, 'Yep, they were gonna make them there Mercedes too,
in Plant ....' apparently some WWII truck plant.  Possible, since they
owned the sales rights.

Oh, I asked him if any photos were ever taken, since I had never seen a 
picture of one, and he said the photo guys were there all the time.   So
any Pfilers ever seen one of these..........is there a photo in the
'Excellence' book?  Is there one extant?

Folks,

A mechanic of good repute in Seattle wants to sell me a '64 'B' motor that
I'd put in my '69 912 - just long enough to sell the car in running order.

I figure my car, before the engine went, was worth maybe $6000.  tired paint,
but no rust, and LOTS of new parts (generator, shocks, clutch, etc.).  He
wants $1700 for his '64 'B' motor.

I looked at the motor the other day.  He pulled it out of a rust bucket,
and the motor looks like hell (corrosion on the valve covers, dirty grease
everywhere), but the sheet metal is all there.

Will this motor *really* bolt into my car?  For how many mechanic-billable
hours?  How long to switch Zeniths for Solexes (manifolds need swapping, too)?

On the positive side, at least the car would be running and, hence, far
easier to sell.  On the negative side, I could spend this money and come out
a little more behind $$$-wise than I would if I could sell as is.

Thanks,

Pete

Yer Unka Bart and I know well of the ebb and flow of unbridled
testosterone in gentlemen so with your next 'shipment' we will include,
along with the green ones you adore, some of our red specials, each
with their own igniter cap.  Also, a copy of the 944 in the Excellence
ad of a couple a months ago suitable for framing *plus* an autographed
autopsy report for your very own collection.  Then, for a nominal fee, we
can provide a replacement for your odometer that, instead of miles covered,
allows you to see what your insurance premium will be the next time you renew.

Dear Steve:
About 3 months ago, just before I got the 76 911, I sold a 74 2.0 914 
that had been in my garage for about 5 years.  Before I knew better, I 
spent about $10,000 restoring it - engine, body, paint, euro P&C, etc., 
everything but the interior.  It got to the point that I completely lost 
interest in it, I hated it because there was still much to do, and I sold it 
through the Auto Trader for $2200, which is what I asked.  It's a long 
story, but the car was nicer when I bought it for $2500, before I put a 
penny into it.  Live and learn!

Dear Mike,

I have had good luck with hardsurface overlay regrinds from Web Cam.

It has been quite a bit of time since I spoke to them last.  I ordered 
them through a friends machine shop and we got a pretty good discount.

The rule of thumb has been that you could go up one level of grind 
without an overlay being applied to the cam.  In your description you 
could probably regrind the cam to the original profile and repair just 
the damaged lobe (maybe lobes?), with this overlay method.  Be sure and 
refurbish the rocker arms.

Heed this!!!!

When you put too agressive a regrind on a cam core, the geometry gets 
all hosed up. The rockers no longer track at the right angle, they
push not *DOWN* on the valve stem but sort of down and *OUT* on the
valve stem, causing premature guide wear, and possible stem failure.

Yup. It's significantly heavier than the early 911s. Gives up a whole lot
in power to weight to the '73 S (or E for that matter)...

> I've always had small, light sports cars (Triumph GT6, MGB, 912), so I'm
> wondering if I'd be happy with a 911SC...

Hard to say. I personally was very very happy with my Euro SC. On the
other hand, it made a lot (a whole lot) more power than a US spec car,
so I had a lot of that "punch" back. On the whole, as 911s progress up 
the timeline, they get more "refined". On the whole, that's good. For
Jim Bob General-Public, it's *REAL* good -- any gooberhead can drive a 993
pretty close to the limit, whereas that limit slips up on you pretty damn
fast in say a '67 S. However, if you're looking for that "sports car feel",
it's hard to get in any 911 -- they're just too heavy.

I made this discovery when I started driving my 356SC more. The more I drove
it, the more I wanted to drive it. Eventually, when something had to go
to cover the five-figure vet bills last year, it was the 911 *NOT* the 356
that made the exit trip.

Then again, while just about everyone I know instantaneously goes "wow!
cool car -- and you drive it all the time??" after the 2nd or 3rd trip
with the highly primitive no-support-at-all seats, early aircraft style
seat belts, no radio, no 12 volt "amenities" and no A/C, that changes 
rapidly into "why the bloody hell don't you get a REAL car and keep this 
in a garage somewhere???" On the other hand, that settles the "who drives 
to lunch" question really quickly... 8{)

Like I said, tough call. My next 911 will either be a '72-73 E or S in
bone stock condition, a project 930 that gets that tired old KKK swapped
for a Paxton blower, or a 993 if this new venture turns out well. 

At the risk of starting something I don't want to see started again, they're
like women -- they're all wonderful, they're all special, there's something
that draws you to each, there's something that drives you crazy about each,
and as much as you'd like to have a dozen of them, you're best settling for
one at a time...

..on my 928 seems to be clogged. At first I thought it was just empty,
but filling the reservoir made no difference. I can hear the motor
whirring, but no squirt. What can I do to unclog it?

While I'm on the subject of pet peeves, what's the kosher method for
realigning the hood? When properly closed, mine is slightly above the
side panel on the left, and slightly below on the right.

Random observation: I have a set of Yokohama HPT's with an overall
diagonal pattern to the tread. The tires are put on right, in that
they all say "this side faces out" the way they should, but the tread
winds up being assymmetric: all 4 tires have a tread angled downhill to
the right viewed from behind. How can this be right?

Finally, and this is a total non-sequitor: I am thinking of trying
those patented spark plugs with the snake tongue cathode (is cathode
the right term?). Should I bother? Is there a good reason _not_ to use
them? Heck, will they even fit? And am I correct in assuming I need to
unbolt the exhaust "crown" to get at all 8 plugs?

Subject: Hotrod parts for 944?


Hello all - I'm new to the list, and to Porsches.  It's good to be here.

I've recently picked up a 1988 944.  It has 36K miles, and runs great!  
Too bad it's not an "S" or "Turbo" model, however.  Luckily, a 5-speed.

I really want to throw on some hotrod parts; I've never been under the 
hood of a Porsche but I've built VW and V-8 engines before.

I'm totally unfamiliar with what hotrod parts exist for the "plain" 944 
and I request some input from other 944 enthusiasts, please.  Here's what 
I envision:

1) Header/non-catalyst pipe for off-road use.   I've been told that as late
   as 1988 (they quit 944s in '89, right?) the 944 was "tweaked" by Porsche
   such that a header won't really flow much and isn't worth the expense on
   this car.  Any second opinions?

   Toward this end, I've been told that a "test pipe" to replace the 
   catalytic converter (no tree-hugging speeches, please) and a cat-back
   (or test-pipe-back) system and muffler would work as well.  Can someone
   recommend or suggest a course of action and source/brandname for such
   equipment?

2) Computer chip - The only experience I have with playing with PROM chips
   in a car was on an '86 Corvette, and the difference could be felt -
   I didn't fully realize it until I swapped back in the stock part prior
   to selling the car, and it felt slower by the "seat of the pants."  I 
   am curious if the $300 cost will garner a significant gain on "such a 
   small" engine as the 2.5L in the 944.

3) Fuel pressure adjuster - this was a highly-touted Corvette item.  Is
   such also the case with the 944?

4) Camshaft - Although I know little of the 944 engine, I am intrigued with
   the OHC cam and the apparant ease of change due to the overhead location.
   I'm sure it will be more difficult to change than I anticipate, but at
   least it's not in the block!  What is the lift and duration of the stock
   part, and what is a popular recommended "high performance" replacement?
   As I have never changed camshafts on a computer-controlled engine, how
   will the F.I. and computer controls respond to a camshaft change?  How
   expensive are 944 cams?  While I wish I did not even have to go into 
   changing internals of the engine (such as cam), I am afraid that this
   may be necessary since how else am I going to eeek out some more
   grunt from a tiny SOHC engine?


Does anybody know what the rater HP was for the 1988 Porsche 944?  I 
looked up a Chilton's guide and it said that the 1986-1987 model (non-S, 
non-Turbo) was rated at 147HP.  Indeed, the car is no slug considering 
some of the wimpier "performance" cars to come out of Detroit during the 
'80s, but with Japanese 4-bangers abounding with multiple cams and 
variable valve timing, I feel that the stock performance of my 944 is in 
need of a little helping hand.  Anybody know what the 0-60 and 1/4 mi. 
times were for this car?  Anybody with an equivalent 944 that has bested 
those times with or without hotrod parts?

Thanks *VERY* much for any suggestions you may have!!  I assure you 
they'll be put to good use!

Let's just say that Porsche probably did a better job setting up the fuel

Here's where you might find some value, but consider that you might have
to raise compression ratio, use larger valves, etc. to get the most out of
the cam.
 
>Does anybody know what the rater HP was for the 1988 Porsche 944?  I 

Yes, 158 bhp. It is higher than the early cars due to higher compression 
ratio.

Don't waste your money on trying to make this car faster. Spend the money on 
your PCA membership and take advantage of their track programs, then your 
car will be faster because of you, not because you have made undriveable on the 
street...

Subject: Rear Lid strut question



Well, I finally got around to putting in the new strut.  Actually 
amazingly easy (1/2 hour max just to be sure you don't drop anything).  
Here's my question:  I got the strut from Tweeks.  When I took off the 
old strut, I noticed the end which connects in the back of the engine 
compartment was significantly wider than the same end on the Tweeks 
part.  The connectors on both ends of the Tweeks part were the same 
narrow width.  On the end connected to the lid, I noticed the original 
part had an identically narrow connector but had a bushing to take up the 
spare space.  Does anyone know if Tweeks will send the busshing to fill 
the space on the front?  Is is a problem to run the car without the 
bushing (other than the obvious potential rattle?  Anyone else have this 
problem with a replacement lid strut from Tweeks and if so how did they 
handle it?  I was told to call their customer service department on Monday.

Thanks for any info!  BTW, just got the car back from her 60k mile 
service.  My wallet will be hurting for quite some time from that one.

Neil,

What I can tell you is I had to replace the compressor in my 83SC, and took the
car to CT Engineering (formerly Carrera Tech) in Campbell. They replaced it with
a rotary (japanese) that works just fine. I dont remember exactly what they
charged me, I have the receipt somewhere, but it was a lot less than $1000. This
included the compressor, labor, and the recharge of the system.

I've finally managed to get some time to get back to work
on my '82 SC that's being converted for track service. Of course,
I started this 6 months ago and still don't have the front suspension
back on the car yet...:-(.

In order to install the Charlie bars, the A-arms had to come off to
remove the factory sway bar mounts for the U-tabs.  While I'm at it,
I've decided to replace the ball joints.  What is the proper process
for removing the "nut" that holds the ball joint to the A-arm?  I
assume that there is a special socket for it, but are there any
other non-destructive options for removing it?

Thanks,

Subject: unable to reverse

well after blowing out the injectors & replacing the intake
manifold gaskets (one was sucking air) the 928 passed inspection!

the trouble is it would not back out of the yard on its own
this weekend cuz it won't go into reverse gear!   this has
never happened before & the previous owner assured me the
same thing but added that it might only need to have a set
screw adjusted.   

does anyone have any experience of not getting into R?

i'd like any info on estimates or suggestions in how to
resolve this problem.   is there any chance the garage
might have screwed it up while they inspected it?   if
so, how could i prove it & what could i do about it?

the good news is that the car is noticeably smoother &
much quieter after they did the injectors/gaskets!  

p.s.  thanx for all the suggestions last time, the ac 
only needed a wire reconnected & is now working great

p.s.s.  i have begun saving relevant 928 comments in
hopes of assembling a possible faq this fall.  just
wanted to let you know that somebody was preserving
it (thanx for the suggestion stan).    if anybody 
has been doing this already please let me know cuz
i only just started on this list very recently &
probably missed quite a bit of great stuff.

Subject: Ouch


     Hello pfiles,

          I've been off the list for the last couple of weeks as I
     was in a bit of an accident on May 17th, and couldn't get near
     my computer until now. On my way to work I had a car decide to
     turn left in front of me (he was coming towards me) and I hit him
     head on. Unfortunately for me I was driving my Yamaha FJ100
     and proceeded to do a very good superman impersonation. I landed
     on my back with my lower half on the sidewalk and my upper half on
     the road. I suffered a broken back and fibula. My right knee has some
     torn ligaments and you should see the huge dent in my gas tank that
     was put there by my pelvis/ naughty bits *ouch*. The doctors say that
     my back is very stable so I'm currently hobbling around on crutches.
     When I was in the hospital getting my X-rays done I noticed a can of
     WD40 sitting on one of the X-ray machines, *as used in hospitals*,
     reminds me of the Monty Python sketch about string. My knee surgery
     is scheduled for July 5.

     Now for some Porsche content. Last month I decided to purchase a
     1989 911 Cabriolet, but figured that I would have to travel to get one
     as there aren't that many for sale locally (Vancouver, B.C.).
     The week after the accident I noticed (well my wife noticed it)
     an add in the local paper for the car that I have decided to purchase.
     An 1989 Carrera Cabriolet, in the color that I want, blue, and with low
     mileage that I want 47000 kms (about 30k miles?). After getting it
     checked out by the local experts I bought it. I still haven't driven it
     yet. My wife has been doing all of the driving, although she was scared
     to drive it initially as she was worried that I'd be pissed if she had 
an
     accident in it. She thinks that the location of the key to the left of 
the
     steering wheel is a little weird, and she also thinks that the pedals
     feel weird as they pivot at the bottom instead of the top. Other than
     those two weird things, and the stiff clutch  she doesn't mind driving 
it.
     If I wasn't injured she probably would never have driven it.

      I can't wait to get better so I can drive it as I have never driven a
     911, only my 914.

This is a weird one.  For years my 911SC has started flawlessly.
But for some reason the darn thing won't start today. The engine

Ummm. Are you talking about the actual element, or the canister itself??
I've seen canisters bulge  a bit from either having the tops overzealously
tightened or from having a plugged up exit hose. I've never seen a
"bulging" element, though...

Hi Porschephiles,

I just acquired what I hope to be the first in a long line of Porsches....
a '72 914/4 which had alterations made to make it look like a 916.

I really like it except for the fact that as I took it out for a drive
after work I noticed the following problems.....

1. The front left driving light(the orange light mounted on fender) doesn't
light I'm not sure if the bulb is out or not.

2. The previous intermediary owner said I should get more/stronger bolts
for the passengers seat what size is supposed to be used?

3. When I turn the key the first notch a red light to the left on the
farthest left gauge turns on and the car makes a clicking noise which comes
from behind (the engine, I think).

4. The rear window rattles

5. The front window is just epoxyed in it looks like. I think there is
supposed to be weatherstripping, but there isn't. Is it supposed to be like
this because I think it would be a perfect spot for the formation of RUST!.

6. The flashers and turn signals don't work( no clicking to or anything).
The horn doesn't work.

7. It stalls unless you are actively accellerating.

8. I can't figure out gearing (No label showing 1,2,3,reverse. When I first
started it I almost backed over my friend.)

9. One fuse is missing, so I'm interested in what fuse sockets affect what
and what color and amp the fuses are supposed to be.

10. The seats both have rips in the seams.

Other than said long litany of problems I love the thing. I just really
want to fix these problems so I can drive it ALL the time.  I really would
love to hear any suggestions you would have  for fixing these problems and
other preventative measures I could take to prevent common problems.  It's
a carb conversion so I think vapor lock shouldn't be a problem.  

Thanks,

Hi Adam! A Porsche (por-sha) at 16 - congrats!

The shift pattern is:

R  2  4
|  |  |
+--*--+
|  |  |
1  3  5

There's a strong spring detent which forces the shifter away from 1st and
reverse.

Fuchs is pronounced Foochs, where the "ch" part is like the ch in
"Achtung!" if you've ever heard it pronounced properly -- Sorry, but it's
not a dipthong that occurs in English, French or Spanish (but does in
Russian, Yiddish and German). Say "Fooks" and you'll be pretty close.

I suggest you get a manual -- it will prove invaluable. Haynes and Lash

Subject: Possible car worth a look

I was out on errands today, and ran across a car that might interest someone.
 It is on the used car lot of Larry H. Miller Lexus, Salt Lake City, UT
(801-264-3600.

1989 944T medium metallic blue
Lt grey leather seats, lt grey carpets
ca. 52,000 mi on odo

I inspected and drove the car, and thought it was pretty solid.  I saw no
signs it had been hit, all paint/upholstery looked original.  The salesman
(Rex Pearson) said it was a local tradein on a new Lexus.

Problem and good areas noted by visual inspection etc.:
  Paint good but needs a good treatment; looks as if it would be
    gorgeous when cleaned up
  Leather in good shape, minor cracking driver's seat only
  I saw no signs of being hit, no repaints, no waves, not even the
     usual door dings
  Hood shocks weak
  Hatch motor and sunroof both work normally
  Carpet under driver's feet is a bit nasty but looks as if it would detail
     out okay
  Clear light RF has cracked lens and must be replaced
  The plastic/rubber trim pieces at the very bottom of the front
     fenders just behind front wheels are slightly bowed downward
     at front but look repairable
  Tires Goodyear Z45 (?), in very good condition
  Wheels need detailing but didn't look bent
  A/C worked
  Car felt tight and together on brief test drive

The really good news: the price on windshield is something like $15,500, but
he offered it to me for 13,995.  By my NADA book (now out of date, 12/94
ed.), this is way below lowest retail.  The car looked as if it had sat on
the lot for a while (I do not believe the market for 944s is very strong
here) so maybe they need to move it.

I have no connection to LHM Lexus, just passing along what I saw.  Hope it
interests someone; looked like a good deal to me.  They were happy to sign it
out for independent inspection.

Ciao,

Dear Peter:
     With regard to that '64 "B" (sic) engine that supposedly will "bolt
into" a 912- it WON'T!!! (Well, actually  it WILL "bolt into" it just won't
work!) 
      First of all, there aren't any '64 356B's. It's either a  '63 356B or a
'64 356C. Tell me what the Engine Number is and I'll tell you what the Engine
really is.
    356B/C's have a completely different clutch, than a 912, and (more
importantly) 912's  are 12 Volt while 356's  are 6 volt. You must change the
flywheel and clutch. Also- the sheet metal is different- you must use the
912's Side Horizontal Tin, and Front & rear Plate. Also, the 356 6 volt
generator, coil, oil temperature gauge should be changed. 
    But more importantly- the 912 has a Rear Engine Mount that bolts onto the
Third Piece of the Case. 356's don't have any such thing! So, you gotta
change the Third Piece- putting the 912's Third Piece onto the 356. Oh, and
the 912 Third Piece requires FOUR long studs to mount the rear mount, the 356
only has ONE long stud there on the Third piece,  so you gotta change out
three of the short 356 studs for 3 of the long 912 studs.
      Oh, and don't forget  to check the size of #4 Main  Bearing on both the
912 AND the 356's crank ifin you're switching Third Pieces. 'Cause the Third
piece from the 912 may have a crank that's a different size on the Mains than
the 356. In which case, don't forget to change the #4 Main Bearing in the
Third Piece- using the old #4 main from the 356's Third Piece in the 912's
Third Piece you're putting on the 356. Is that clear?
    Oh, and the 912's  two lower engine mounting studs that mount the engine
 to  the trans  are jusssst a itty bit longer, long  enough  that the 356
lower studs won't fit through the 912's trans case. So you gotta swap the
lower studs from the 912 to the 356.
   Yes, you CAN put a 356B or C into a 912, it'll bolt  right up.
Unfortunately, it WON'T WORK unless you make the above changes/mods.

   If you'd like additional details, give me a call at (408) 727-1864. And:
KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!

Subject: 914 F.I./Carb Questions

I have a few questions that maybe someone can answer.

1.  I have a '74 914 with the L-Jetronic system.  Over the years the F.I. 
has been butchered and jury-rigged together, but it seems to run okay.  
The biggest problem is, the car only gets about 25 MPG.  Is this normal 
for 2000 lb., 76 HP car?  I haven't checked the color of the spark plugs, 
but it doesn't smell or look like its running rich.  As far as I know, 
all of the components are there, just the vaccuum hoses are awry.  Does 
this poor mileage have a solution?

2.  I really want to go to carburetors, but I don't know what would be 
the best selection.  I want Dellortos but would take Webbers just as 
fast.  Question is, what size would be best for a stock 1.8L?

3.  Does anyone have some used carburetors for sale?

Thanks alot!

Sure, trade for a Civic CRX HF.... No really, that's about right. You may
be able to get all the way up to 30, but there's really not that much room
for improvement. And if you drive it hard, there's *NO* room for improvement.

OK, you asked for it.... The *BEST* size is **NONE**. You'll get worse milage,
worse performance (unless you increase compression and change cams), and
worse streetability with carbs. The *ONLY* advantage that carbs have is
that they're "easier to understand". And if you're bright enough to be
working for that piece of Ford, have and be able to use Internet access,
and find this list, figuring out the EFI should be *NO* big trick, you just
need to spend the time on it.

If you persist with this lunacy, Webers are a *slightly* better choice than
Dellortos for one (and only one) reason: you can get Weber jets *anywhere*
because it's the default carb of the SCCA. And you'll need them, because I
can gurantee that you'll have to change all of them, as the unit will NOT
be jetted correctly for your application.

Near as I can tell, CB Performance in SoCal is the only real source of
parts for Dellortos. I have *NO* idea why the VW world decided that they
were a better choice than Webers, but as I say all the time, just because
you see it in a magazine doesn't mean jack shit about how well it really
works.

> 3.  Does anyone have some used carburetors for sale?

Sure. Lots of people in CA, NJ, NY, and parts of TX where they're making you
go back to the original EFI to pass the emissions inspection. You *DO* want
to be able to drive the car in a couple of years, right? Then save that 
old nasty EFI you take off -- you'll eventually need it again.

Subject: Re: '81 911SC Won't Start

Steve,

I seriously doubt you have burned any gizmos, (or razanfrats or flavens
either).

When the key is in the "run" position you are supplying 12 volts to the
heating elements in both the auxiliary air regulator and the control pressure
regulator taking them from "start engine mode" to "normal operation" mode.
 The lower control pressure provided in "start engine mode" provides a
slightly richer mixture in the FI which is needed to start a cold engine even
on a relatively warm day.

Letting the car sit for a while (with the key off) should solve the problem
by returning the heating elements to ambiant air temperature.  Then you can
start over.

You might also try slight "priming"  of the engine.  This is accomplished by
removing the air filter housing, turning the key to the "run" position, then
lifting the sensor plate arm (seen in the back of the right side of the
airbox slightly hanging down from the top) until you hear a screeching sound.
 This sound is the injectors opening and will provide a little extra fuel for
the cold start.  If the arm offers no resistance to up-pushing and you don't
hear the injectors opening, you may have a fuel pump relay or fuel pump
sensor plate contact problem.

My guess would be that after sitting for an appropriate length of time, your
car will start fine.

Dear Scot:
I had a 74 2.0 that I converted to dual Webbers, with the following 
results:

1) Better acceleration.
2) Much more noice from the engine compartment.
3) Worse gas mileage.
4) Harder starting.
5) Dirtier engine compartment.

So I went back to FI.

This doesn't make sense, the bolts are 10mm and they can only go in the

The light is the generator light which is normal when the engine is
not turning, hence there is no charging.  The fuel pump which would be
behind you on a '72, goes on for a few seconds when you turn the key,
however you say later that this is a carb conversion, so this should not
apply.

The windshield should have a black butyl seal going all the way around, and
aluminum trim pieces.

Check fuses first.  You may have either 1 or two horns in the front

Subject: 993 Questions

Fellow P-philes,

Not the best weather this weekend here in Florida fo cruising (<----
Hurricane Allison), and I thought I pick the collective brain of our group.

I recently replaced the rear tires on my 993(I got almost 11K out of them).
 The Dunlop SP-8000 are super tires; I especially appreciate their
performance in the wet.  Unfortunately, the Porsche-spec version of this tire
is in very short supply (the 255/40ZR-17 size) and my set took several months
to get here from Germany.  Dunlop customer service was very helpful, however:
ask for "Jim" at 1800.847.3382. Since I got the tires I sense a little more
vibration at "high speeds" (we're talking significantly more than 65MPH).
 Obviously the tires were balanced after being mounted, but how critical is
balancing in here?  Will just a small amount of imbalance lead to significant
vibration? Any thoughts?

Next topic: the 993 headlights are the BEST OEM lights I've ever used.
 They're nice and bright with an excellent "Z-beam" like pattern (the new 911
Turbo's lights are supposed to be even better, utilizing new "ion discharge"
technology!).  My owner's manual gives clear instructions on replacing the
individual elements in the headlight but doesn't identify the specific bulb.
Are these run of the mill bulbs? 9004-9006, and if they are, could they be
upgraded to the higher wattage bulbs now on the market (for "off road usage"
only, of course)?

Thanks in advance for your help

Congradulations! The 914 is an fun car, that just gets more enjoyable the
longer you drive it! :)  Before you try and tackle anything dificult, get a
repair manual. Haynes makes a book for the 914 that get you through almost
anything you're likely to encounter.

Probably a bulb, the're cheap enough to replace.

>2. The previous intermediary owner said I should get more/stronger bolts
>for the passengers seat what size is supposed to be used?

Did they say why? This sounds kinda fishy to me. Pull up the carpets and
look for rust. Either that, or it really is missing a bolt or two.

>3. When I turn the key the first notch a red light to the left on the
>farthest left gauge turns on and the car makes a clicking noise which comes

The red light is the generator light which is telling you that the Key is "
on" but there's no voltage coming from the generator. This is bad if the
engine is running, but normal if it isn't. If the engine were running, it
would most likely mean that the belt broke. The "clicking noise" is
probably your fuel pump. It's loud and makes a whiring sound when you first
turn the key to the "on" possition.

>4. The rear window rattles

It's loose, mine rattles to. I'm going to try and fix it sometime in the
future, but not right now.

>5. The front window is just epoxyed in it looks like. I think there is
>supposed to be weatherstripping, but there isn't. Is it supposed to be like

Hmm, I can't say more without a better description. Is this aparent from
the inside or outside?

>6. The flashers and turn signals don't work( no clicking to or anything).
>The horn doesn't work.

Check your fuses. One may be missing or burnt out.

>7. It stalls unless you are actively accellerating.

I can't help you much with a carb'ed engine, but I'd say you're probably
running lean. The stock 914 FI is really simple and quite effective, it's a
shame when people carb the engine in the belief that they can get more
power. Maybe at the top end a little, but not without loosing drivablity. 

>8. I can't figure out gearing (No label showing 1,2,3,reverse. When I first

Could be your horn/flasher fuse. There -should- be a plastic cover over the
fuses that say which is which, but the owners manual should also have it.

>10. The seats both have rips in the seams.

Those seats are over 23 years old. You should be happy that they han't
collapsed. There are some things that just come with the package when you
get an old sports car. But there are probably some good upholstory shops
near you that can do a good job. Personally, I'd just get some seat covers
and put the money into tires or maintenance.

Subject: 911T - Zenith vs. Weber Carbs 

My 911T currently run with Zenith carbs and K&N Air filters. A 
buddy of mine has a set of Weber carbs to sell, but they are in 
the need of a rebuild. The local Porsche gurus tell me the 
Zeniths are okay as long as they work (which they do) but the 
Webers will add to the performance of my 911. Plus they are 
becoming rarer than hen's teeth, and I should at least grab a 
set and leave them on the shelf until I can either afford to 
rebuild them or the Zeniths give their last puff. My questions 
are these:

1. How much HP are the Webers likely to add?

2. Are they really becoming so rare?

3. How much should I be prepared to spend on them?

4. How much for a rebuild and where? (I understand this is a 
specialized art)

5. And finally, is there a market for my functioning Zeniths?

Subject: RE : why want 71-73.5 911's

Charlo Barbosa asked :

>Can someone tell me why people want these older Porsches
> so badly these days? 

some reasons :

1) Light weight : my '72 S weighs 2330 pounds. It has 190
horsepower. Any questions?
When I carry 4 spare tires/rims, tools, jack, etc, it still
weighs less than an SC, but feels sluggish, and brakes
very weak (no power brakes!).

2) Simple to repair : My '72S has no power anything. It will
drive fine with no batteries except for the ignition.

3) easy to upgrade to later model stuff without destroying
the good points (although this hurts the value of an S, E,
or clean T).

4) rare - most have rusted away, and only a few thousand
of each year and model were made anyway.

5) performance in autocross and track : go to one
and find out. Though not faster on a high speed track,
they are more fun to drive than the later models.
A 2.4 (especially S or E) should be able to beat an SC
and most 3.2 Carreras in an autocross.

> What does CIS and MFI mean?  

CIS was introduced on the 73.5 911T as a cheaper alternative
to the MFI, as carbs would not meet pollution specs and MFI
was too expensive. CIS is a constant (non timed) injection
system which is also used on VWs, Audis, MB, and other
cars. It was used on all USA 911's from '74 to '83.
It is considered somewhat mechanical, as there are
no electronic injection pulses. CIS needs mild cams for air flow
monitoring. But it was good enough to use on the 930
turbos (and even the 934?).

MFI is a purely mechanical injection 
with a cam-belt driven pump with pistions forcing fuel at VERY HIGH
pressures to the injectors at exactly the right time. MFI can be
found on all 911E and S from '69 to '73 and the '72 - 73.5 911T.
It was also used on many early 911 engined race cars, and 
up to at least some 935 turbos (although the race version 
was often simpler without warm-up or cold start stuff).

Subject: Alternator Problems (AGAIN!)


Hi All,

In Feb of 94, about three weeks after I brought my 84 911 Carrera home, 
the alternator died.  Put off by the local dealer's price I bought a 
reman unit from an outfit in Miami that advertises in Excellence.  Car 
ran great, until last week.

After a two and a half hour drive in the dark hours of the morning, the 
alternator again gave up the ghost.  Same symptoms: no battery light with 
the engine off and the key in the on position.  A burnt diode I'm told.

I did not have time for any problems on that day.  So my twisted little 
mind worked out a plan to get me through it.  I called my wife to bring 
out my truck.  Yes, she drove the same 2.5 hours as I did and took the 
day off to help me as well!  What we did was swap the batteries every 
hour and she accompanied me to every stop that day.  We drove about 400 
miles doing this and by the time we reached home again that evening the 
correct battery was in each vehicle.  The day was saved.

The next AM I wanted to check a few things regarding this problem, turned 
the key to the on position, and the damn light was back on!  I have never 
heard of a self-repairing alternator so I was reluctant to believe that I 
was out of the woods.  I have since driven the car for a week with no 
other problems.  I'm stumped.

Could there have been a loose wire or corrosion that I may temporarily 
have remedied while swapping the batteries multiple times?  Could high 
temps in the engine compartment have caused an intermittent problem with 
the alternator?  In my experience, diodes are like light bulbs, when they 
blow, they're gone. (Obviously not a burnt diode; at least the first time, 
last week.)

And worst of all, did I possibly spend money on an alternator that I didn't 
need last year?!  All suggestions/replies appreciated.  BTW, the priest 
won't consider exorcism until I rule out all of the normal possibilities.

Thanks in advance for the help!

Scott, just cut a circle from a couple of layers of cotton cloth and cover
the end of the hose (a rubber band works fine to hold it in place).  This
will filter any oil from the crankcase fumes.  Change it as it gets dirty.
 Not an elegant solution, but it works fine on a daily driver.

Subject: Re: 944 performance: thanks



Thanks to all who replied in regards to my quest for improved 944 
performance.  Also, thanks to those who suggested the FAQ.  I was hoping 
that the FAQ would deal more with some of the cat-back exhaust systems, 
and perhaps camshaft selection - although I fear cam swaps/lifters are 
prohibitively expensive.

It is somewhat disappointing to learn that the standard 944 performance 
is all that can be expected from the car.  I've never owned a Porsche 
before this, and the only reason I ended up with this car is I was 
fortunate to find a low-mileage car at an ABSOLUTE STEAL.

Some of the suggestions I've received range from "enjoy the car the way 
it is" to "unbolt the steering wheel, enter a 944 Turbo, bolt the 
steering wheel back on the new car."  Heh heh heh.   In actuality, it 
would seem that those are the only options  if I am to drive a Porsche.

I will say that I am very surprised with the performance dilemma 
surrounding the Porsche 944.  As I knew almost NOTHING about Porsche 
prior to purchasing this car (and I still know almost nothing), I just 
knew that Porsche has had a reputation for wringing out enormous 
quantities of horsepower from comparatively small cubic centimeters.  I 
drove the 944 and found it to be a fairly spirited little car, but no 
drag race contender by any stretch of the imagination.  I bought the car 
because it was dirt cheap, and because I figured that with the Porsche 
stigma for high performance, I could tweak a few more horses out of the 
car without too much effort.  How wrong I was in the latter assumption, eh?

I cannot stress how surprising it is to me that hot-rod parts and 
practice are so rare.  The last "high performance" car I had was an '86 
Corvette (another good deal) that I was able to tweak into a formidable 
tread-burner with reasonably few dollars.  I figured that in regards to 
automobiles, the Germans usually do things better than the Yankees.
Do they really?

The Corvette, as much fun as I had with the car, was certainly NOT
an automotive paragon in terms of quality (IMO) - at least not the
1986 model I had.  Some parts weren't necessaryily cheap, either, but I was
able to do everything (inc. engine replacement) myself, and the Chev. 350 
parts were DIRT CHEAP.  I had LOTS of little things going wrong with that
car, which irritated the hell out of me and drove me to clean it up and 
sell it.  As I understand it, the newer ones (I hope) are better; the 
80's SUCKED in terms of quality coming from Detroit and I'll never own 
80's Detroit iron again.

What about my 944's quality?

According to the FAQ, the list price of the windshield is $2000!!!  What???

The timing belt potential for problems is not good news.

The motor mount problems are a problem I DO HAVE.  Good news to hear it's 
just a motor mount causing the vibrations I was having.  Lame that it 
will cost $110 each and I don't know how many I will need.

I haven't had any water pump problems yet, but what?  How many years have 
cars had water pumps, and there are still problems?   If I interpret the 
FAQ, the thermostat is a difficult item to change?  What???

The oil cooler seal (allowing antifreeze/oil mix) sounds like a real 
headache.  I haven't noticed anything wrong, but I guess I have no way of 
knowing if my seal has been replaced.

Ball joints not removable from suspension arms.   WHAT???  WHY!!!!


Good lord!  This makes my 944 sound as bad as something slapped together 
by a drunk UAW team on a Friday.  I suppose my expectations were that 
Porsche reputation for quality was up there with other fine German auto 
makers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz.  I find it difficult to believe after 
all the problems with the 944.

Nevertheless, I do like the car, although not as much as the 911 series.  
There is no doubt in my mind that a fine late-model 911 is waaaaay 
outside my budget.  However, a 944 Turbo may not be too far away - but I 
have never seen one for sale and don't know what I can get for my 39K 
mile '88 944.  Any suggestions?

A friend of mine picked up a used low-mile '93 Camaro (275HP/325 lb-ft) 
for a mere $13K, and put a Paxton supercharger kit ($3500) and some 
aftermarket headers.  Hell, the thing probably outhandles my 944, and 
with roughly 400HP/400 lb-ft on tap, offers performance probably close to 
a new 911 Turbo. (WHICH IS MY DREAM CAR, INCIDENTALLY).

Of course, I don't expect a 4-banger to run like that, but I suppose I'm 
surprised that if a "cheapie" American car like that can receive such a 
boost from bolt-ons, why can't a "fine quality" German car like my 944 
receive similar treatment?  Sure, I can bolt my steering wheel on a 944 
Turbo, and the Camaro owner could have bolted his steering wheel on a 
Corvette ZR-1, but he didn't have to - for a mere $3500+, he can make 
mince meat out of a Corvette ZR-1.

Here's to hoping that Paxton makes a 944 kit!  Heh heh heh.

I've got to just write this up and leave it laying around somewhere so I
can just forward it to the list every time this comes up...

Solexs have *SIGNFICANTLY* larger main venturis than Weber 40, so they make
a lot more top end power. Weber 40s have higher air velocity at the intake valve
due to the smaller venturis so produce more power in the lower R's, but that
falls off rapidly over 4000 RPM. Weber 44s don't have the right metering
circuits for giving reasonable performance at lower R's (read: can't use on
the street), but work as well as Solexs in the high R's.

Solexes can be "worn out" -- the main bore is not round and the butterfly
doesn't fit, the throttle shafts "wobble" in their holes, etc. This is due
to old age (many are more than 30 years old), and can be fixed *TRIVIALLY*
by places like Eurometrix, NLA, Stoddard, etc for under $200 a carb.

Webers are most likely to be newer and for a variety of reasons, like they
have ball bearings on the shafts instead of bushings, don't wear out as
much. Webers are highly configurable and it is a very exacting art  to get
a pair of Webers set up just right for your engine, mean air density, and
operating characteristics. Can't be done without a dyno, can't be done without
a whole shitpile of spare parts. There is no "tuning guide" for the Webers
for your car, but you can assemble your own from other people's anecdotal
evidence and one of the several pretty good books on Webers. 

The Solexs on the other hand were *MADE* for this car, and the tuning
guide in the factory service manual is both exact and accurate. Even with
sophisticated tuning equipment, Peter Albrecht didn't find much room
for improvement in some testing he did this winter.

I have  Webers on my 356 right now, but that's because I needed something
"right then" when I was done with the engine and I had all this Weber
crap laying around from the various E Production engines so it was easy
to do. I have lived with the backfiring, the weak acceleration, the mis-jetting,
and all that for the last 18 months but haven't liked it. The Solexes that 
are supposed to be on the car are in the process of being rebuilt, and as 
soon as they come in, I'll change. I should have done so earlier, but had
other priorities like suspension parts gone bad, brake parts gone missing,
and the ever present electrical gremlins... Just got around to addressing
the carbs late last month, in fact.

Someone has either been smoking something, or is trying really, really
hard to sell you what they have in their garage...

> 1. How much HP are the Webers likely to add?

Zero. Well, not really, but damn near. If I recall correctly, the venturis
are slightly larger, so there will be additional airflow at high RPM, but
you gotta wind it on up there to "find" that power... Around town, you
won't notice the difference.

> 2. Are they really becoming so rare?

Weber is discontinuing production of NEW carbs. PMO is gearing up to produce
Weber knock-offs, at close to the original prices. There are still a few
thousand sets of 40 IDAs out there, though. So "rare" is *NOT* an appropriate
adjective. Finding a set for sale may be problematic, but as increasingly
larger numbers of states adopt CA emissions standards, people that have put
them on cars with CIS will have to re-fit CIS, so there should be a steady
supply...

> 3. How much should I be prepared to spend on them?

A set of new 40 IDAs from PMO under their Zenith Conversion option is
what? Just under a grand?? It's in that neighborhood, anyway. And that's
new carbs.

> 4. How much for a rebuild and where? (I understand this is a

A "casual" rebuild can be done by any competent shop, figure on a few
hundred per carb. A "complete" rebuild will be someone like Eurometrix
and I have *NO* idea how much they're likely to charge.

> 5. And finally, is there a market for my functioning Zeniths? 

Yeah, to people who wish they hadn't bought Webers.... This is one of those
deals where it's a tough call -- it's not like replacing the Zeniths
will hurt the value of the car that much, but I'd certainly keep them 
intact and with the car just in case it becomes important to someone 
at some time down the road. Originality is starting to become important
for these older cars, so screwing it up is not a good idea unless it's
reversible...

Porsches are great -- "Better" is completely in the eye of the beholder.
Or sometimes the seller, as it were.

The '78 and '79 models had larger intake valves and air pipes and plenums,
so they would flow more air. The later models had smaller valves and pipes
for the simple reason that at the lower operating speeds in the US, the
performance is *MUCH* better with the smaller valves as it increases
mean air velocity across the valve, pushing up power. Of course, there
is *SOME* restriction that shows up at higher RPM, but I have not been
able to find it with "street engines" using CIS at speeds up to 7000 RPM.
I will grant that with modified cams and valve timing, and programmable EFI 
instead of CIS, that the bigger valves are better for racing applications 
where you spend a lot of time north of 6000 RPM.

Me? I'd go for a later engine. In fact, I'd consider *SERIOUSLY* a '84-86 
Carrera instead. It makes more power, it already had the tensioner update,
and most importantly, it's not CIS. Don't get me wrong, CIS is *GREAT* when
it works right, but all this stuff is getting to be 15-20 years old and
hasn't always been taken good care of. You can spend a ton of money replacing
the fuel distributor, the control pressure regulator and the injectors
before you get the car running right. The DME systems in the Carreras are
a lot more "binary" -- they either work right, or thye don't work. And
when they don't work, it's a lot easier and cheaper to fix.

Hi Gang:

I've posted on refinishing alloys in the past and I got a lot of great replies.
The wheels I have recently purchased look like they were spray painted by a 3
year old (on one of Bart's little pills).  I would like to clean them up before
I repaint them.

I wanted to get all of the paint off and then dip them to emulate the original
finish but the dipping may be a bit too much trouble and others have gotten
great results with the thin 3M tape and Wurth Matte Black.  I may go the spray
route but now it's time to prep them.  Here's the question:

Has anyone ever used any type of paint remover to clean up a previous "botch"
job or to remove the paint from their alloys?  I am concerned that a harsh
chemical like the paint remover would damage the alloy... true?  I was told by
another that any type of media blasting would ruin the anodized finish... true?
Does anyone really know the process under which these wheels were made?  Can you
offer me any pointers?  Are you out there?  My car should be totally finished in
the next 3 weeks and I would like some nice wheels underneath it.

As usual, thanks in advance for all your help.

Jim,

  I enjoyed your honest musings upon becoming an "accidental" 
Porsche owner.  I hope you come to enjoy it as much as me and 
some of my colleagues here like ours.  If not, you could probably
sell it to one of us for a modest return, if you really got
a deal!

   I'll leave most of the "defense" of 944's to others with 
more 944 experience, but I have to comment on two things.  
Why do you believe that the ability to improve the output 
of an engine by simple "tweaking" is a characteristic of 
a well-engineered car?  Would good engineering not already 
make use of more of the potential of an engine configuration?
Note, however, that the charms of a big, torquey, easy-to-
maintain 'Murrikan V8 are not lost on me!  I simply prefer
light slot-cars.

   As to the specific output, your "bottom of the line" 944 
has what, 158 hp/2.5l = 63.2 hp/l?  Your buddy's Camaro has 
(normally aspirated) 275 hp/5.7 l, or 48.2 hp/l, and even blown 
has only ~70 hp/l.  Hell, a 944S makes 75.2 hp/l!  So, yes, I 
think that your perception that the Schwabians are able to
wring more hps/cc than most folk is correct.  And there is no
way (IMHO) that the Camaro will "outhandle" your 944.

Also, there was really no great advantage to the Euro chip in these cars

Don't get me wrong -- it's not that hard (well, it obviously is for some
shops, but that's another story) but it can be *EXPENSIVE*. If you need to
change all the parts until it starts working right, that can be another
$2k. *PLAN* on changing the injectors as no one has likely done that until
now, and you *MAY* need to change the fuel distributor. At some point, you
will need to change the control pressure regulator, and if you do that
you may be *FORCED* to change the fuel distributor to remain compatible with
all the supercession parts in the series... So you're "cheaper" SC might
not be such a bargain in the long run. 

This is just something that I've started seeing in the last two years as
this stuff starts to age. I personally like CIS injection a lot, and
spent a fair amount of time learning how to make it jump through hoops
and let you pump up the power on a CIS engine. But you gotta be prepared
to spend the bucks if you want to keep it. DME on the other hand seems not
to have electronics failures for the most part, just injector and sensor
failures (which also show up in CIS) making it significantly cheaper to
maintain.

You can spend big bucks for the "optical alignment tool", Tracey, or you can

James, your statement about the Camaro outhandling your 944 brings to mind
scenes of IMSA Camaros chasing 935s (admittedly not 944s) up the hill in Turn
1 at Road Atlanta, skittering wildly in the drifts as those solid rear ends
tried to match the firmly-planted independent rear suspensions of the
Porsches.  Bill Elliott, a NASCAR and Ford pilot of some renound, was
overheard saying, after a few laps in the Porsche, "Now THESE things HANDLE!"
 And THAT about a Porsche that's not noted for its forgiving demeanor.  Such
refinement is what you'll find in your 944.

Welcome to the fold.  Join the PCA and stay awhile.

My 944 engine seems to be whisting.  At first I thought it was the belts 
so I replaced them.  But it was still there.  It seems to be coming from 
around the distributor cap area or the main drive shaft.  Any Ideas of 
what it could be or how to get rid of it?  If it were a clogged valve or 
tube, how would I locate it without ripping the engine apart?

Subject: Tips on the 924 requested ..


Hi,

I am making a gingerly step into this part of the auto-world ... eyeing
on buying a '82 924. I am looking for a car that has just a good
measure of the 'thing' in its looks and label. The 924 seems a
perfect fit ! But I do need to be sure that I can offord maintain.

The question I have .. how expensive are we talking about ? Can you
give me an idea in some dollar terms so it can help me make up my
mind.

I am told that a 924 is not too expensive to maintain - I combed
through the entire porschephile archives, and generally found very few
people talk about the 924. But at least every reference to a
"water-cooler" was also accompanied buy a word suggesting "relatively
inexpensive" ... which I think was encouraging.

For eg. one particular 924 I am looking at, is a '82 924 with probably
80-90K miles on it. This one needs a new muffler, and maybe a bunch of
other similar things replaced as well. What would a muffler cost ? How
much does the fact that the 924 is not in production make a difference ?

Any Porsche parts catalogs on-line somewhere ? or anywhere I can call
for a quote or catalog ? (Will try my local mech. morrow).

Thanx much in advance .. Please eMail cc: shri@cs.umass.edu as well ...
I have just sent a request to sign on this list, and dont want to 
miss any replies.

PS: BTW.. anyone want to seek a 924 in the NE area ?

Well, I've seen them from $6K to $25K.  Of course, the $6K ones are 
basket cases that need everything and the $25K ones are concourse
winners.  

I'm looking in the $15K region for a daily driver which may
need a little work (but for that, I expect a rust-free tub and good
mechanicals).  I don't know if this is a fair expectation, however,
since I haven't been able to find one these past several months.

Nope, not being a half-measures kind of guy... However in the two-wheel
world, there's this product called "Golden Spectro" that's a hybrid blend
that's supposed to be just the thing. Partly due to the problems that those
wet clutches have with having synthgoo sloshing around them, I think.

Since my ride is a Beemer, and I don't have the wet clutch problem, I went
straight to the real synthetics a long time ago.

I'm also using the Valvoline synthetic in my 356, so far to good effect.
It did exacerbate a problem I had with accuracy on my oil temp guage which
was finally fixed by some re-wiring, and it does seem to slip past the rear
main seal a bit, but it's fine otherwise. Change it every 2k miles, just
like clockwork....

Subject: POC Tribute to LeMans - Report

Just returned from beautiful Willow Springs, where I had the good fortune
meet, not one, but 2 Pfilers, in person! It's great to be able to put a face
with the messages posted by Wade Guthrie and Thomas Kuby!

Unofficially, Saturday nights's 3 hour, Tribute to LeMans, enduro, was won by
Mark Mehalic. I worked as a member of a pit crew for a 944 that finished 16th
overall/2nd in class (starting field was about 40) cars. 

It's an impressive sight, and sound, when 40 Porsches get the green flag and
head off into the night on a extremely fast track like Willow Springs.

After 3 hours, 3 cars were on the lead lap (R. Raimist's 3.8L RSR leading,
Mark Mehalic's 911 2nd, and B. Auberlein's pole sitting 911 3rd), with the
1st/2nd place cars only seconds apart. Raimist's RSR slowed, running out of
fuel less than 1/2 lap from the finish, allowing Mehalic to win! Raimist's
car coasted across the finish line in 2nd place (we later learned that the
driver for this leg of the race was unaware of the RESERVE switch!).

23 cars finished the race, with the leaders completing 108 laps.

I you have a chance to enter or attend this event in the future, I highly
recommend it.  We'll have a more complete run down on the event in PML this
month.

1986 928S Auto (low Ks)					$ 69,990
1988 944S (63,000ks)					$ 55,000


These are all out of the local rag (Sydney Morning Herald) and mostly
dealers prices. I've also just discovered the "Porsche Club" (no-one answered
the phone so I'll try later) More on that later ..(I'll point them towards this
wonderful list :^)

I've seen a few 928(S)'s (my choice) around the 1978-9 vintage for about
$31,000, some even for $25,000 but I'm keeping away from those (dogs usually).
A 1980 + is my choice ... I'll hang out for it ..NO rush !!

Subject: Webers or  Solexes for a 912?

to: CKRAUSE13@aol.com
from: maestro@well.com
Subject: Webers or Solexes on 912's?

Ah, yes, which carbs to use? Solexes or Webers? Yes, it's True-
the Maestro admits it! He likes Weber Carburetors. He ALSO likes good 
Solex and Zenith Carburetors!
    (Note that the operative word in the above sentence is "good".)
When Solexes and Zeniths are Good, they're great. And when Solexes and
Zeniths aren't good, they can be Very, Very Bad! 
But Solexes and Zeniths are Original! So, ifin you REALLY want to
Win the Concours, it helps to be Original. 
(Fortunately, the Maestro has a Solution for bad Zeniths or Solexes-
a MaestroMaster Carburetor Rebuild! Which magically makes good-running 
Solexes and Zeniths out of what had been Very, Very bad running Solexes 
and Zeniths.)
    However, ifin you're NOT climbing the concours ladder and just want to 
DRIVE the car. And say, you're living in an Area of the Country
"blessed" with oxygenated gasoline that comes and goes with the seasons,
you'll
find that changing the Main Jets or the Air Correction Jets makes your
356 run better.
 And ifin you've ever changed a Main Jet in a Solex or a
Zenith, you'll note that the entire contents of the Float Bowl gushes
out like a Mississippi flood- all over what used to be your Concours
Sheet Metal and onto your Spark Plug Wires, on its way to your hot
exhaust pipe.
 Nowadays with the Tertiary Butyl Ether oxygenated gasolines have,
a float bowl full of today's gas might put you to sleep before the 
fire starts. 
However, ifin you happen to have a set of Weber Carburetors, you 
can change the Main Jet (and air correction and Emulsion Tube) in less 
that 30 seconds per hole! With a dime. Or a screwdriver ifin you're 
broke and out of dimes. And NO gas leaks anywhere!
Try THAT on your Zenith or Solex! In less than 10 fun-filled,
gasoline-drenched minutes per carburetor.
Webers are meant to be adjusted, played with, raced with, have fun with,
so the adjustments are made with some forethought. 
Buy, hey, IT'S YOUR MONEY! Ifin you want a Concours set of
Solexes or Zeniths, no Problem. Or ifin you want Weber Carbs- 
either the 40 or 44IDF's, again, it's your money. 
     Anyhow, like everything else, Webers have gone through several 
evolutionary versions- mostly with the intent of improving the breed. 
Years ago Webers had a lousy 2-position accelerator pump (the fulcrum pin
for the accelerator pump lever had two positions- giving you a choice of
too much or WAY too much gas, or Too much and Not Enough.)
All Zeniths and Solexes had infinitely adjustable
accelerator pumps- so one could screw them up in infinite number of ways.
Weber soon saw the advantage of this and some 10 years ago
added infinitely adjustable accelerator pumps, as the current model
Webers currently have. (Check your Webers to see which you have.)
About 5 years ago, the Weber Jet Stacks sprouted a 1"
extension so they stood above the top of the carb. This made removal
of the jet stack a lot easier than when they were flush with the carb top. 
(Year ago, with flush-mounted brass jet carriers, unscrewing them was a
cinch, but getting the bastards out of the hole was a real pain. And no,
a magnet won't work-'cause the jets and carrier are brass!)
They fixed that with the 1" extension. Now, the only thing the Maestro
doesn't like about Webers today is that the importer INSISTS on supplying 
Linkage Arms that wedge at half to 2/3 throttle. After telling the importer
repeatedly about the wedging linkage arms and being told repeatedly by the
Importer that "Nobody else ever had this problem before",
the Maestro gave up and made up linkage arms that Go All The Way
Down! Giving you Full Throttle, 'cause you deserve it.
 Now, if you want a mild to warm street engine,
the 40IDF Webers are best for a mild engine, the 44's for a
"Hot" street engine. The 40IDF Webers should be used with Solex
Intake Manifolds and the 44's should be used with the "Weber"
intake Manifold and the necessary surgery performed on the
Side Vertical Sheet Metal. (The Weber Manifold sits lower than
the Solex Manifold, and the inside of the Weber 44IDF will hit
two of the three bolts that hold the Spring Plate for the Top 
Linkage Cross Bar. You must remove the washers from under those
two bolts and/or grind the bolt heads down a bit.)
Currently, there are several Weber
kits of varying degrees of quality. Or lack thereof. There's
a 20+ page section in "Murphy is my Copilot" describing the
detail difference and difficulty (or ease) of installation.
Since I install many Weber kits a year, I like the kits I use
to be as trouble free as possible. This was learned The Hard
Way by installing most every kit available!) 
 The current batch of 40/44IDF Weber kits, are the
Latest Model Weber having the Infinitely Adjustable
Accelerator pump and the 1" extension on the jet stack that
make jet changing a joy, the Large K&N Air Filters, linkage
that WORKS and the Weber manifold. Check your set to see what you have.
Any questions? Give me a call at (408) 727-1864. And:
KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!!!
The Maestro

Subject: 944 DME and strange noises 

Hi there -
- ----------
As the proud newPorschephiles #1454                         Mon Jun 5 10:28:05 CDT 1995
 owner of a clean '87 944 S, I've of course got a few 
questions for the knowledgeable fellows I know are out there - my apologies 
if they've been covered after january '95! In that case, I'll find them in 
the files some day.... I bought the car with 67578 km, which is exactly 
42 k miles (and had both belts changed immediately thanks to this very list). 

1) On lesser cars, you can often just release the clutch without any extra 
throttle for initial acceleration. This works on my 944 S _when the engine 
is cold_, but any later starts without extra throttle, such as at traffic 
lights etc., mostly kill the engine. Seems that the engine requires some
1100 rpm before releasing the clutch to avoid trouble when hot. Has this 
anything to do with the idle regulator? Have already fixed the too low 
contact resistance due to an oil film or similar - as I learned from previous 
postings. That cured the slightly high idle, for some time at least. Now, the 
slightly high idle seems to have returned, _except when cold_. Think I've 
read somewhere that the L-Jetronic has a coolant temperature sensor - could 
a defective device cause an additional 200 rpm at idle?? Anyway, applying 
throttle before/when releasing the clutch only when the engine is hot seems 
weird to a newcomer like me. (Yes, this is my 1st car!) 

2) DME functions: Previous postings, for instance Stan's in july 94, indicate 
that the DME is adaptive. Exactly what is being adapted, and on what kind 
of information/sensors is this adaptiveness based? How long does adapting 
take, and to what extent is this of significance to the not-so-fast driver? 
Does the CPU (1802?) know the thermodynamics of fuel combustion etc.
Seems to me that I can depress the throttle fully when in 5th after some 
time at a constant 120 km/h - and nothing much happens the first few
seconds. Is this really 'a feature'? (120 happens to be the Autobahn speed 
limit around here <g>) Enlightning as to the secrets of the DME would be much 
appreciated! Maybe someone would care to elaborate. 

3) The steering wheel or its bushings sometimes emit 'rubbing' noises. 
I believe the noises are produced somewhere inside the coupe, along the
steering wheel shaft (not in the foot well), - and they are possibly 
temperature dependent. Is there a horn contact to be lubed or something? 
Sounds as if something plastic is touching something else. 

4) There's also a most peculiar noise coming from the leftmost air inlet,
or possibly from behind the instruments, again at certain times. Sounds very 
much like a frozen pea being gently shaken in a plastic cup, if you know what 
I mean... Seems to be correlated with acceleration, at 20 km/h in 2nd as well 
as at 80 km/h in the 4th. Pulsing the throttle reliably generates the
sound, if it's there at all that day. Is this car about to self destruct??

5) The lefthand windshield wiper emits rubbing noises even when the
windshield appears to be sufficiently wet. Very annoying to have to switch to
'intermittent' at every traffic light.. Can the wiper pressure be
adjusted?

6) Rainwater gathers at the bottom of the luggage compartments, although
all visible hoses seem to be intact. ASD Porsche, Zuerich, told me that
'this is normal, just dont't place anything in the compartments'. Should
I ever let them touch my car again? Can't really imagine this to be so 
'normal'. The car was beautifully repainted some years ago, so I guess the 
rear light seals were temporarily taken off. But would this really allow 
water into the luggage compartments?? I remember something about brake lights
turning into aquariums from the archives... The little 'platform' behind
the lights just below the carpeting is the most moist area, and the
drivers' side is most affected. 

7) All my new tires, Bridgestone RE71, lost 0.1 bar during the 1st 2 weeks,
with just 110km of non-heavy driving. The old ones kept their pressure for 
much longer. Is this ok? (another 1st-car-in-my-life q., I must admit!)

8) Had the front weels aligned some time before I got new tires, the old 
ones were badly worn on one side. Should I realign again (+1500 km)?

9) Someone said in the archives: 'If the cassette compartment hinge is ok, 
then buy the car'. Well, I did, and the hinge did of course break from
old age or whatever the 3rd time I carefully opened it. Someone
mentioned metal hinges a while ago - where can I get one (in Europe..),
and what should I expect to pay??

10) Compulsory newbie options sticker question: This has been covered several 
times, but apart from side mouldings #418, speakers/antenna amp. #441, the 
sunroof #650, electrical windows #651 and the power steering #657 , I've found 
nothing to decipher C10 and CL7. Seems to have sport seats etc. as well, but 
these don't appear on the sticker... The car is a ROW. Also, the sticker says 
the car is a 944 type 042. What's 042?? If anyone happens to know what these 
numbers mean, I would very much like to know! 

This got slightly long, but I'm of course a bit concerned about this my
1st car (nice choice, I think!). As I'm on a strong diet concerning e-mail, 
I would appreciate any answers to these questions directly to me as 
'lien@hoggar.ethz.ch' as well as to the list. 
Thanks in advance for any competent answers!

Sincerely,
Hans-Petter Lien

Hi All,

My '82 911 SC has some wiggles in the steering wheel at about 60 - 70
mph.  My guess is that the schocks are gone or the car is out of

The alignment 'seems' ok.  I check it by moving to the right side of
the crown of the road and seeing if the car crawls down toward the
shoulder (good) or back up toward the crown (bad).

Anyone have an idea how I can test the front schocks?? I've seen folks bounce

Subject: 944S2 down on power

I ran into a problem with my 944S2 (1991, 15K miles) at Watkins Glen this
weekend.  The car ran great for a day and a half but then several laps
into a mid-day run session I started to lose power at high RPMs.  I was
getting concerned that I wouldn't even be able to make it back into the
pits.  The car wasn't missing, but wouldn't pull high RPMs.  It seemed 
like it just wasn't getting enough fuel so we decided to replace the fuel 
filter.

The other symptom is that at low RPMs it's "bucking" as if I'm jabbing
at the throttle or not releasing the clutch smoothly.  You can even feel
this at 2,500 RPM in 5th gear.  It smooths out at higher RPM (so we just
drove faster on the way home... :-))

Replacing the filter made the car run _much_ better, but it was still very
slow to rev.  For example, I usually pull about 6K in 4th gear at the 
top of the esses.  Yesterday I was lucky to be hitting 5,800 RPM by the
_end_ of the back straight.  I guess I'm down about 20MPH in top speed.
I _could_ hit the rev limiter in 3rd gear, but it took much longer to 
get there.  All four spark plugs look okay.  Disconnecting the O2 sensor 
didn't help either.  The fuel pressure regulator has vacuum at idle, as 
does the other regulator at the front of the rail.    All the ignition 
connections are clean and tight.

Any ideas?  Could I have bought bad gas the night before?  We bought
gas about an hour after a very bad thunderstorm.  The car did run great
for two run groups the following morning though.

Subject: My First Time!

Greetings!

If you can remember the anticipation, nervousness, worrying about
everything you took apart or rebuilt, and hearing your *first* porsche
turning over and *starting* - then you know how I felt this weekend!!

Finally, after *three long years* of restoring a rust-bucket '66 912,
it finally came to life this weekend!  It actually started rather
easily - I guess marking down all the carb settings during the rebuilds
payed off.  Then, smoke filled my garage!  Uh oh - but, after looking
towards the fire extinguisher, I realized that the smoking was coming
from the paint burning off the new Bursch muffler pipes near the
cylinders - phew!

After running it a while (stored for 3 years, a short idle then, and
before that 12+ years of storage) I noticed the driver's side carb
was backfiring a little bit.  Slight timing adjustments and adjusting
the valves took care of that.  Float bowl adjustments were easy, but,
messy.  Carb sync was close and we couldnt figure out how
to "twist the throttle shaft" as the factory manual suggests.  So, we
left that for another day. 

The valve covers leaked, even with new seals, so we still need to
figure that out - maybe some gasket sealer is in order?  The cork
doesnt want to form to the cover.

Well, it was time to back her out of the garage and try out the
transmission.  I had vowed to 'drive no Porsche before my own' so
the desire was high - even if it was a 50' driveway!  Reverse, no
problem, 1st okay, 2nd okay, 3rd yup, 4th nope, 5th nope!  What
the H*LL!?  I just knew that I should have left that leaking
transmission shift-fork seal alone!  Murphy had finally visited
me in a painful way.....

I decided to not let the transmission "rain on my Porsche parade"
and it could wait until Sunday night for closer inspection.  I'll be
damned if I can figure out why the stupid shift fork thingy isnt
engaging the 4-5th "floating gears"; guess I need a second pair
of eyes to see what I'm missing.

Although the transmission stuff is a bummer, it couldnt come close
to overshadowing the sweet sound of *my* Porsche idling smoothly in
the garage/driveway.  All my neighbors came over during the day to
hear it run and congratulate me (after privately wondering if it
would *ever* leave my garage!).

So, life is good!  Those long three years all of a sudden dont
seem so bad afterall!  I kinda like it that you could point to
anything on the car and I would have some kind of story to tell you.
Where the part came from, what it took to rebuild/restore, 
what it does, or who helped me.

Well, I hope this e-mail reminds those of you who like to do stuff
yourself and learn in the process of "your first time."

      If you mean a Torque wrench, I was finally satisfied (after
  having 3 or 4 just go bad....) with going to a Pawn shop and
  buying a Snap-On for $80. Nice stuff. Don't get a cheap torque
  wrench unless you are only fixing lawnmowers.

      If you mean an Impact wrench (I don't think there is an air-powered
  torque wrench, at least for automotive) you can probably get by with
  a cheap one from Home Depot or Harbor freight or..... Handy things to have

Subject: mirror, starter, glass 911 questions

Well,
an interesting weekend all the way around.  Most of the bad stuff had nothing
to do with Porsches, so I'll limit myself to the three small things which now
need attention on the car...

Passenger side mirror is nearly dangling by the wires.  It appears that the 
small threaded, brassy colored "pipe" has come unscrewed from the mmirror,
and is sitting in the base.

Do I use an allen wrench to remove the base from the door, and will this all 
be painfully obvious as to how I can re-thread this into the mirror?  I'm 
hoping it is really that simple.  If not, please tell me where to look to get
started.  I can't believe how much I depend on that mirror.

Secondly, and even more strangely, I have had a problem three times in the 
last two weeks.  The car (having been driven relatively hard for about three
hours at highway speeds) doesn't start.  Now this is curious for two reasons,
the battery is fine, powers the guages, etc., but the starter won't turn.  No
clicking, no attempt to make noise, nothing.  All three times, a short roll
down a hill, pop the clutch (with the key on of course) and the car starts
instantly and runs fine.  I am suspecting the starter solenoid, but it will
start all the rest of the time just fine. And, YES there are hills in texas,
I was at canyon lake, not in Houston all three times. <g>

Anyone ever have this kind of behavior before?  I'm puzzled.

Lastly, I picked up a rock chip and 12 inch crack right in front of the drivers
side in the windshield.  Damn muddy pickup trucks throwing s*#& everywhere on
the road.  Do you recommend Porsche glass, or has anyone any experience with
these "repair your windshield" things?

thanks for your time,

Tracy,

Another simple method for adjusting headlights is the 'garage door method.'
Drive the car up close to a garage door or suitable vertical surface with
the lights on.  Mark the center of each beam spot.  Back the car up about
15-20 feet and see where the beam spots fall relative to the original marks
and adjust accordingly.  Final test is on a dark road at night.

Subject: 911 Brakes are binding slightly.


Hi,

After fixing all my problems from last week...
My disc brakes on my 1981 911SC are not releasing completely after
stepping on them SOMETIMES.  I am not sure which wheel(s) are binding
on me, or if its front and/or back.  I happens maybe 3 or 4 times out of
15 or so stops.  

The brakes pads seem to stay pressed against the disc, but not so
bad as that I can't pull away from a stop.  Just a slight bind.  And
if I get them to bind then coast to a stop, it slows the car, and 
then stops it as if I had been pressing the brakes lightly.  After
they bind, the brake pedal is then hard to press right from the start 
of depression.  If I tap it a bunch of times, usually the binding 
releases, sometimes it takes a while.  I guess it must be the pistons 
in the calipers???

I store the car winters.  Do the walls of the cylinders in the brake
calipers get corroded after time?  How can I diagnose this problem
to figure which wheels are binding?  Is there a simple fix, or big $$$?
The rotors are smooth with no pits or scratches.  How hard is it to
remove the calipers and then the pistons, and smooth the walls, or
replace worn parts like the pistons?  Is this only a job for pro mechanics?
Lastly, how much would rebuilt calipers run me?  Thanks.

I think you have just had some bad luck, it's not hard to work on these.
Even the Haynes manual is enough to do most things. But I think you may
not be preparing correctly for you repairs. When you do points, plugs, 
rotor, and cap, you should replace one at a time and make sure the car is
running OK after each step. Then you know which one is bad if there's a
problem. I have had several NEW Bosch and other parts that were NFG.
I have found it is easier to change the points by removing the distributor.
Then you can clean it, set the gap, and grease the cam a bit. Also
a drop of oil down the shaft will make it happy.

The Bosch points are made very poorly - they don't line up parallel and
will often only touch at one side. Before installing them, hold them up
to the light and view between the points contact area. You will probably
see light coming through one side. Bend the solidly-mounted point
with pliers to make them meet parallel. Now you have blueprinted points
that will run longer before going out of spec.

Don't sell your car,  just get in the right frame of mind and you should
be able to do any necessary repair work.

  Hey Trond,

  I have a '73 T that I put an '83 SC engine into. I wrestled with the
  decision for a couple of years, then went ahead and did it when the old
  2.4 (MFI) was having difficulties with emissions. IMO, it is a good blend
  of old and new ( or perhaps more appropriately now, old and older) which
  make the car very enjoyable to drive daily. It is reasonable to maintain,
  and there is enough documentation and help (this list included) that I
  can work on it and learn more about it.

  As for creature comforts, it's pretty spartan, but is
  comfortable/convenient enough for my tastes.

   I suppose it is not a good choice for club racing or
  originality/investment, but I don't plan on racing it soon and if I
  worried about the car's value, I wouldn't drive it, in which case its
  value to me would go down.

  If you want to know anything more specific, e-mail me directly and I'll

Subject: Webers or Solexes on 912's?

Ah, yes, which carbs to use? Solexes or Webers? Yes, it's True-
the Maestro admits it! He likes Weber Carburetors. He ALSO likes good 
Solex and Zenith Carburetors!
    (Note that the operative word in the above sentence is "good".)
When Solexes and Zeniths are Good, they're great. And when Solexes and
Zeniths aren't good, they can be Very, Very Bad! 
But Solexes and Zeniths are Original! So, ifin you REALLY want to
Win the Concours, it helps to be Original. 
(Fortunately, the Maestro has a Solution for bad Zeniths or Solexes-
a MaestroMaster Carburetor Rebuild! Which magically makes good-running 
Solexes and Zeniths out of what had been Very, Very bad running Solexes 
and Zeniths.)
    However, ifin you're NOT climbing the concours ladder and just want to 
DRIVE the car. And say, you're living in an Area of the Country
"blessed" with oxygenated gasoline that comes and goes with the seasons,
you'll
find that changing the Main Jets or the Air Correction Jets makes your
356 run better.
 And ifin you've ever changed a Main Jet in a Solex or a
Zenith, you'll note that the entire contents of the Float Bowl gushes
out like a Mississippi flood- all over what used to be your Concours
Sheet Metal and onto your Spark Plug Wires, on its way to your hot
exhaust pipe.
 Nowadays with the Tertiary Butyl Ether oxygenated gasolines have,
a float bowl full of today's gas might put you to sleep before the 
fire starts. 
However, ifin you happen to have a set of Weber Carburetors, you 
can change the Main Jet (and air correction and Emulsion Tube) in less 
that 30 seconds per hole! With a dime. Or a screwdriver ifin you're 
broke and out of dimes. And NO gas leaks anywhere!
Try THAT on your Zenith or Solex! In less than 10 fun-filled,
gasoline-drenched minutes per carburetor.
Webers are meant to be adjusted, played with, raced with, have fun with,
so the adjustments are made with some forethought. 
Buy, hey, IT'S YOUR MONEY! Ifin you want a Concours set of
Solexes or Zeniths, no Problem. Or ifin you want Weber Carbs- 
either the 40 or 44IDF's, again, it's your money. 
     Anyhow, like everything else, Webers have gone through several 
evolutionary versions- mostly with the intent of improving the breed. 
Years ago Webers had a lousy 2-position accelerator pump (the fulcrum pin
for the accelerator pump lever had two positions- giving you a choice of
too much or WAY too much gas, or Too much and Not Enough.)
All Zeniths and Solexes had infinitely adjustable
accelerator pumps- so one could screw them up in infinite number of ways.
Weber soon saw the advantage of this and some 10 years ago
added infinitely adjustable accelerator pumps, as the current model
Webers currently have. (Check your Webers to see which you have.)
About 5 years ago, the Weber Jet Stacks sprouted a 1"
extension so they stood above the top of the carb. This made removal
of the jet stack a lot easier than when they were flush with the carb top. 
(Year ago, with flush-mounted brass jet carriers, unscrewing them was a
cinch, but getting the bastards out of the hole was a real pain. And no,
a magnet won't work-'cause the jets and carrier are brass!)
They fixed that with the 1" extension. Now, the only thing the Maestro
doesn't like about Webers today is that the importer INSISTS on supplying 
Linkage Arms that wedge at half to 2/3 throttle. After telling the importer
repeatedly about the wedging linkage arms and being told repeatedly by the
Importer that "Nobody else ever had this problem before",
the Maestro gave up and made up linkage arms that Go All The Way
Down! Giving you Full Throttle, 'cause you deserve it.
 Now, if you want a mild to warm street engine,
the 40IDF Webers are best for a mild engine, the 44's for a
"Hot" street engine. The 40IDF Webers should be used with Solex
Intake Manifolds and the 44's should be used with the "Weber"
intake Manifold and the necessary surgery performed on the
Side Vertical Sheet Metal. (The Weber Manifold sits lower than
the Solex Manifold, and the inside of the Weber 44IDF will hit
two of the three bolts that hold the Spring Plate for the Top 
Linkage Cross Bar. You must remove the washers from under those
two bolts and/or grind the bolt heads down a bit.)
Currently, there are several Weber
kits of varying degrees of quality. Or lack thereof. There's
a 20+ page section in "Murphy is my Copilot" describing the
detail difference and difficulty (or ease) of installation.
Since I install many Weber kits a year, I like the kits I use
to be as trouble free as possible. This was learned The Hard
Way by installing most every kit available!) 
 The current batch of 40/44IDF Weber kits, are the
Latest Model Weber having the Infinitely Adjustable
Accelerator pump and the 1" extension on the jet stack that
make jet changing a joy, the Large K&N Air Filters, linkage
that WORKS and the Weber manifold. Check your set to see what you have.
Any questions? Give me a call at (408) 727-1864. And:
KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!!!

Subject: 944 DME and strange noises 

Hi there -
- ----------
As the proud new owner of a clean '87 944 S, I've of course got a few 
questions for the knowledgeable fellows I know are out there - my apologies 
if they've been covered after january '95! In that case, I'll find them in 
the files some day.... I bought the car with 67578 km, which is exactly 
42 k miles (and had both belts changed immediately thanks to this very list). 

1) On lesser cars, you can often just release the clutch without any extra 
throttle for initial acceleration. This works on my 944 S _when the engine 
is cold_, but any later starts without extra throttle, such as at traffic 
lights etc., mostly kill the engine. Seems that the engine requires some
1100 rpm before releasing the clutch to avoid trouble when hot. Has this 
anything to do with the idle regulator? Have already fixed the too low 
contact resistance due to an oil film or similar - as I learned from previous 
postings. That cured the slightly high idle, for some time at least. Now, the 
slightly high idle seems to have returned, _except when cold_. Think I've 
read somewhere that the L-Jetronic has a coolant temperature sensor - could 
a defective device cause an additional 200 rpm at idle?? Anyway, applying 
throttle before/when releasing the clutch only when the engine is hot seems 
weird to a newcomer like me. (Yes, this is my 1st car!) 

2) DME functions: Previous postings, for instance Stan's in july 94, indicate 
that the DME is adaptive. Exactly what is being adapted, and on what kind 
of information/sensors is this adaptiveness based? How long does adapting 
take, and to what extent is this of significance to the not-so-fast driver? 
Does the CPU (1802?) know the thermodynamics of fuel combustion etc.
Seems to me that I can depress the throttle fully when in 5th after some 
time at a constant 120 km/h - and nothing much happens the first few
seconds. Is this really 'a feature'? (120 happens to be the Autobahn speed 
limit around here <g>) Enlightning as to the secrets of the DME would be much 
appreciated! Maybe someone would care to elaborate. 

3) The steering wheel or its bushings sometimes emit 'rubbing' noises. 
I believe the noises are produced somewhere inside the coupe, along the
steering wheel shaft (not in the foot well), - and they are possibly 
temperature dependent. Is there a horn contact to be lubed or something? 
Sounds as if something plastic is touching something else. 

4) There's also a most peculiar noise coming from the leftmost air inlet,
or possibly from behind the instruments, again at certain times. Sounds very 
much like a frozen pea being gently shaken in a plastic cup, if you know what 
I mean... Seems to be correlated with acceleration, at 20 km/h in 2nd as well 
as at 80 km/h in the 4th. Pulsing the throttle reliably generates the
sound, if it's there at all that day. Is this car about to self destruct??

5) The lefthand windshield wiper emits rubbing noises even when the
windshield appears to be sufficiently wet. Very annoying to have to switch to
'intermittent' at every traffic light.. Can the wiper pressure be
adjusted?

6) Rainwater gathers at the bottom of the luggage compartments, although
all visible hoses seem to be intact. ASD Porsche, Zuerich, told me that
'this is normal, just dont't place anything in the compartments'. Should
I ever let them touch my car again? Can't really imagine this to be so 
'normal'. The car was beautifully repainted some years ago, so I guess the 
rear light seals were temporarily taken off. But would this really allow 
water into the luggage compartments?? I remember something about brake lights
turning into aquariums from the archives... The little 'platform' behind
the lights just below the carpeting is the most moist area, and the
drivers' side is most affected. 

7) All my new tires, Bridgestone RE71, lost 0.1 bar during the 1st 2 weeks,
with just 110km of non-heavy driving. The old ones kept their pressure for 
much longer. Is this ok? (another 1st-car-in-my-life q., I must admit!)

8) Had the front weels aligned some time before I got new tires, the old 
ones were badly worn on one side. Should I realign again (+1500 km)?

9) Someone said in the archives: 'If the cassette compartment hinge is ok, 
then buy the car'. Well, I did, and the hinge did of course break from
old age or whatever the 3rd time I carefully opened it. Someone
mentioned metal hinges a while ago - where can I get one (in Europe..),
and what should I expect to pay??

10) Compulsory newbie options sticker question: This has been covered several 
times, but apart from side mouldings #418, speakers/antenna amp. #441, the 
sunroof #650, electrical windows #651 and the power steering #657 , I've found 
nothing to decipher C10 and CL7. Seems to have sport seats etc. as well, but 
these don't appear on the sticker... The car is a ROW. Also, the sticker says 
the car is a 944 type 042. What's 042?? If anyone happens to know what these 
numbers mean, I would very much like to know! 

This got slightly long, but I'm of course a bit concerned about this my
1st car (nice choice, I think!). As I'm on a strong diet concerning e-mail, 
I would appreciate any answers to these questions directly to me as 
'lien@hoggar.ethz.ch' as well as to the list. 
Thanks in advance for any competent answers!

Sincerely,
Hans-Petter Lien

In preparation for a driver's ed event this weekend, I replaced my

using the Castrol GT LMA stuff) I opened was a different color than
I had ever seen before.  It had a very definite "antifreeze green"

Hi All,

My '82 911 SC has some wiggles in the steering wheel at about 60 - 70
mph.  My guess is that the schocks are gone or the car is out of
alignment.

The alignment 'seems' ok.  I check it by moving to the right side of
the crown of the road and seeing if the car crawls down toward the
shoulder (good) or back up toward the crown (bad).

Anyone have an idea how I can test the front schocks?? I've seen folks bounce
the car and say yea or ney, but I dont know what they are looking at
and they have a hard time explaining it.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: 944S2 down on power

I ran into a problem with my 944S2 (1991, 15K miles) at Watkins Glen this
weekend.  The car ran great for a day and a half but then several laps
into a mid-day run session I started to lose power at high RPMs.  I was
getting concerned that I wouldn't even be able to make it back into the
pits.  The car wasn't missing, but wouldn't pull high RPMs.  It seemed 
like it just wasn't getting enough fuel so we decided to replace the fuel 
filter.

The other symptom is that at low RPMs it's "bucking" as if I'm jabbing
at the throttle or not releasing the clutch smoothly.  You can even feel
this at 2,500 RPM in 5th gear.  It smooths out at higher RPM (so we just
drove faster on the way home... :-))

Replacing the filter made the car run _much_ better, but it was still very
slow to rev.  For example, I usually pull about 6K in 4th gear at the 
top of the esses.  Yesterday I was lucky to be hitting 5,800 RPM by the
_end_ of the back straight.  I guess I'm down about 20MPH in top speed.
I _could_ hit the rev limiter in 3rd gear, but it took much longer to 
get there.  All four spark plugs look okay.  Disconnecting the O2 sensor 
didn't help either.  The fuel pressure regulator has vacuum at idle, as 
does the other regulator at the front of the rail.    All the ignition 
connections are clean and tight.

Any ideas?  Could I have bought bad gas the night before?  We bought
gas about an hour after a very bad thunderstorm.  The car did run great
for two run groups the following morning though.

Subject: My First Time!

Greetings!

If you can remember the anticipation, nervousness, worrying about
everything you took apart or rebuilt, and hearing your *first* porsche
turning over and *starting* - then you know how I felt this weekend!!

Finally, after *three long years* of restoring a rust-bucket '66 912,
it finally came to life this weekend!  It actually started rather
easily - I guess marking down all the carb settings during the rebuilds
payed off.  Then, smoke filled my garage!  Uh oh - but, after looking
towards the fire extinguisher, I realized that the smoking was coming
from the paint burning off the new Bursch muffler pipes near the
cylinders - phew!

After running it a while (stored for 3 years, a short idle then, and
before that 12+ years of storage) I noticed the driver's side carb
was backfiring a little bit.  Slight timing adjustments and adjusting
the valves took care of that.  Float bowl adjustments were easy, but,
messy.  Carb sync was close and we couldnt figure out how
to "twist the throttle shaft" as the factory manual suggests.  So, we
left that for another day. 

The valve covers leaked, even with new seals, so we still need to
figure that out - maybe some gasket sealer is in order?  The cork
doesnt want to form to the cover.

Well, it was time to back her out of the garage and try out the
transmission.  I had vowed to 'drive no Porsche before my own' so
the desire was high - even if it was a 50' driveway!  Reverse, no
problem, 1st okay, 2nd okay, 3rd yup, 4th nope, 5th nope!  What
the H*LL!?  I just knew that I should have left that leaking
transmission shift-fork seal alone!  Murphy had finally visited
me in a painful way.....

I decided to not let the transmission "rain on my Porsche parade"
and it could wait until Sunday night for closer inspection.  I'll be
damned if I can figure out why the stupid shift fork thingy isnt
engaging the 4-5th "floating gears"; guess I need a second pair
of eyes to see what I'm missing.

Although the transmission stuff is a bummer, it couldnt come close
to overshadowing the sweet sound of *my* Porsche idling smoothly in
the garage/driveway.  All my neighbors came over during the day to
hear it run and congratulate me (after privately wondering if it
would *ever* leave my garage!).

So, life is good!  Those long three years all of a sudden dont
seem so bad afterall!  I kinda like it that you could point to
anything on the car and I would have some kind of story to tell you.
Where the part came from, what it took to rebuild/restore, 
what it does, or who helped me.

Well, I hope this e-mail reminds those of you who like to do stuff
yourself and learn in the process of "your first time."

      If you mean a Torque wrench, I was finally satisfied (after

  buying a Snap-On for $80. Nice stuff. Don't get a cheap torque

Subject: mirror, starter, glass 911 questions

Well,
an interesting weekend all the way around.  Most of the bad stuff had nothing
to do with Porsches, so I'll limit myself to the three small things which now
need attention on the car...

Passenger side mirror is nearly dangling by the wires.  It appears that the 
small threaded, brassy colored "pipe" has come unscrewed from the mmirror,
and is sitting in the base.

Do I use an allen wrench to remove the base from the door, and will this all 
be painfully obvious as to how I can re-thread this into the mirror?  I'm 
hoping it is really that simple.  If not, please tell me where to look to get
started.  I can't believe how much I depend on that mirror.

Secondly, and even more strangely, I have had a problem three times in the 
last two weeks.  The car (having been driven relatively hard for about three
hours at highway speeds) doesn't start.  Now this is curious for two reasons,
the battery is fine, powers the guages, etc., but the starter won't turn.  No
clicking, no attempt to make noise, nothing.  All three times, a short roll
down a hill, pop the clutch (with the key on of course) and the car starts
instantly and runs fine.  I am suspecting the starter solenoid, but it will
start all the rest of the time just fine. And, YES there are hills in texas,
I was at canyon lake, not in Houston all three times. <g>

Anyone ever have this kind of behavior before?  I'm puzzled.

Lastly, I picked up a rock chip and 12 inch crack right in front of the drivers
side in the windshield.  Damn muddy pickup trucks throwing s*#& everywhere on
the road.  Do you recommend Porsche glass, or has anyone any experience with
these "repair your windshield" things?

thanks for your time,

Tracy,

Another simple method for adjusting headlights is the 'garage door method.'
Drive the car up close to a garage door or suitable vertical surface with
the lights on.  Mark the center of each beam spot.  Back the car up about
15-20 feet and see where the beam spots fall relative to the original marks
and adjust accordingly.  Final test is on a dark road at night.

Subject: 911 Brakes are binding slightly.


Hi,

After fixing all my problems from last week...
My disc brakes on my 1981 911SC are not releasing completely after
stepping on them SOMETIMES.  I am not sure which wheel(s) are binding
on me, or if its front and/or back.  I happens maybe 3 or 4 times out of
15 or so stops.  

The brakes pads seem to stay pressed against the disc, but not so
bad as that I can't pull away from a stop.  Just a slight bind.  And
if I get them to bind then coast to a stop, it slows the car, and 
then stops it as if I had been pressing the brakes lightly.  After
they bind, the brake pedal is then hard to press right from the start 
of depression.  If I tap it a bunch of times, usually the binding 
releases, sometimes it takes a while.  I guess it must be the pistons 
in the calipers???

I store the car winters.  Do the walls of the cylinders in the brake
calipers get corroded after time?  How can I diagnose this problem
to figure which wheels are binding?  Is there a simple fix, or big $$$?
The rotors are smooth with no pits or scratches.  How hard is it to
remove the calipers and then the pistons, and smooth the walls, or
replace worn parts like the pistons?  Is this only a job for pro mechanics?
Lastly, how much would rebuilt calipers run me?  Thanks.

I think you have just had some bad luck, it's not hard to work on these.
Even the Haynes manual is enough to do most things. But I think you may
not be preparing correctly for you repairs. When you do points, plugs, 
rotor, and cap, you should replace one at a time and make sure the car is
running OK after each step. Then you know which one is bad if there's a
problem. I have had several NEW Bosch and other parts that were NFG.
I have found it is easier to change the points by removing the distributor.
Then you can clean it, set the gap, and grease the cam a bit. Also
a drop of oil down the shaft will make it happy.

The Bosch points are made very poorly - they don't line up parallel and
will often only touch at one side. Before installing them, hold them up
to the light and view between the points contact area. You will probably
see light coming through one side. Bend the solidly-mounted point
with pliers to make them meet parallel. Now you have blueprinted points
that will run longer before going out of spec.

Don't sell your car,  just get in the right frame of mind and you should
be able to do any necessary repair work.

Subject: Re: 911SC versus '72 - '73 S;E;T's


  Hey Trond,

  I have a '73 T that I put an '83 SC engine into. I wrestled with the
  decision for a couple of years, then went ahead and did it when the old
  2.4 (MFI) was having difficulties with emissions. IMO, it is a good blend
  of old and new ( or perhaps more appropriately now, old and older) which
  make the car very enjoyable to drive daily. It is reasonable to maintain,
  and there is enough documentation and help (this list included) that I
  can work on it and learn more about it.

  As for creature comforts, it's pretty spartan, but is
  comfortable/convenient enough for my tastes.

   I suppose it is not a good choice for club racing or
  originality/investment, but I don't plan on racing it soon and if I
  worried about the car's value, I wouldn't drive it, in which case its
  value to me would go down.

  If you want to know anything more specific, e-mail me directly and I'll
  answer any questions you have about it.

carerra questions
Hi, my name is Elliott Lee and I'm new to this list.  I have a 1988 Carerra
Cabriolet and I have a few questions.  About 5+ months ago I had my clutch
fixed -- I was having extreme difficulty putting it into gear.  Lately if I'm
driving at low rpm's i can hear the rear of my car vibrating.  It sounds like
the license plate vibrating against the bumper, but I can't tell because of
course I'm driving.  It seems to happen say if I was shifting to 2nd at a low
rpm and start accelerating.  It really sounds like something is loose.  I tried
putting something between the license plate and the bumper, but it still made
the noise.  Could this have anything to do with the clutch service?  I think I
have to be moving in order for this to happen.

Secondly, I've just moved to the Santa Monica area and I was wondering where a
good place to take my car to get fixed can be found.  What's the best place to
get parts?  The only place I've been to is Performance in Van Nuys.

I had a chance the other day at Automotion to look through all of these
books. The Bosch book is a great book for learning about FI, but if your
car has D-Jetronic, the information is pretty limited. I was hoping to 
find a technical guide to D-Jetronic that had great detail on all of the 
components (i.e. complete info on each system component, electronic and
mechanical specs, etc.). L- and LH-Jetronic and K- based systems are covered
in great detail, along with Motronic. 

The restoration guide is excellent, filled with many pictures and details
about the cars. The "914 Handbook" is a manual similar to the Haynes guide
that is published under a new cover (I've goe one of the old ones at home). 
It's a very good complement to the Haynes guide. 

WRT this subject of FI: Has anyone on porschephiles ever made up a 914 
D-Jetronic and K-Jetronic tuning guide? I'm talking about a procedural 
guide for taking a car and putting into a base state of tune, with 914-
specific tips and specifications? Something like:

1.	Adjust valves (list of valve clearance specs for different 
	engines and proceedure or reference to proceedure goes here...)
2.	Set timing...

and so on. When getting my '73 2.0L engine into a state of decent tune,
I had a whole list of problems I presented my mechanic with (I went to 
a mechanic after years of screwing around with the thing with no luck).
He listened patiently, then told me that he would check on these items
after he went through his procedure of putting the car into a base state
of tune. Needless to say, many of the "problems" I had weren't around after
he was finished. He did a number of things I wouldn't have done, such as
check all the plug wires resistance (found a bad one) and a number of other
small items that added up to poor tune. An eye-opening experience for your
typical untrained home mechanic. 

One more thing: I'm getting ready to do my pedal bushings with the 
Automotion kit. Any tips?

Hi Steve,

I had the same problem with my '88 911 a few months ago.

I was adjusting the windshield washer nozzles and had to leave the ignition
on for approx. 10 min while adjusting the spray pattern. When I finished I tried
starting the car but it wouldn't start; it would crank well but it won't start.
It finally started about 20 mins later. This starting problem would manifest
intermittently after that incident. 

I was told that a bad DME relay was the cause of the problem, I replaced the
relay about a month ago, and the intermittent starting problem still exists!

I suspected a ground problem, and checked/cleaned all ground points, relay contacts,
checked/replaced fuses and the problem still exists.

In my particular case, when the starting problem happens, the engine cranks ok
but it appears like there was no spark. When it finally starts, the engine runs
perfectly.

Now, I also think that somehow something happened to the ignition system. I hope
the problem is not the control unit.

Any ideas, please help us,

Javier - '88 911

Subject: headlight alignment

Folks,

First, many thanks to those who reponded to my "Queer Ride Height" post.  
After careful inspection, the rear springs look like hell and will be replaced
with the 195lb progressive springs Stan mentioned.  Additionally, the 
passenger side torsion bar adjustment was "all the way in" while the drivers
side adjustment was "all the way out".  

I had some trouble trying the get the adjustment bolt to move on the drivers
side, but I will continue trying to adjust it as a short-term solution 
pending replacement of the torsion bars.

Now to the problem at hand.  I've tried three times to get the headlight
motor assembly properly aligned with marginal success.  After reassembly with
the covers, with the headlights in the closed position, they still are not
flush with the hood as they stick up just short of an inch.  

Since the drive bar is a solid, fixed-length piece, I can't see how the 
adjustment could be made there(I have tried).  Is is proper to make the
adjustment via the mounting plate for the light-mount itself? (The one with
three allen screws in trunk and two in the wheel well)

Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

The Camaro will *not* outhandle the 944. Improved as it is over the
previous generation of Camaro's, it still has a solid rear axle and
the cowl still shakes on rough roads. The 944 is as stiff and tight
as anything I've driven. And when the Camaro is as old as your 944
it'll be up on blocks, half primer / half rust and a salvage yard
would have to be paid to come pick the thing up.

Your original post also mentioned quality. If my car is any indication
the cars were built with quality. That means that when they came off the
line they were assembled to the specifications produced by engineering.
I also think the car was engineered with quality. When I work on my 951
I see lots of clever engineering and most of it looks like it was derived
from race experience. A response to your post pointed out the specific
power of the 944 engine. A similar situation exists in the chassis and
suspension. There are a lot of high-performance parts in a very stiff
and fairly light package.

Enjoy the 944. Maybe you should drive a 951 and see how that feels. Good
luck with your car.

Subject: Questions

  
  My car is a '83 928S Euro. 
  
  1) I've recently been hearing a sound coming from the
  direction of the front of the car while driving that
  sounds kind of like valve ticking. I typically hear 
  the sound (it's faint) under mild acceleration in
  second or third gear. I turned the A/C off and I 
  still hear it. If I rev the car in neutral I don't 
  hear it. One strange thing I noticed is that if 
  I depress the clutch very slightly, maybe on half
  of an inch, the noise seems to go away. Any ideas?
  
  2) The car has 64k miles on it, never had a timing belt change.
  When I had it in the shop for it's regular maintenance 
  I asked the dealer his opinion as to whether I should
  have the timing belt changed. He said he took the belt
  off and inspected it and that it probably had another
  15k miles in it. From what I've heard about changing/tensioning
  the timing belts does it seem likely that he really
  took it off to inspect it? With the timing belt talk
  recently I'm getting a little paranoid. Who needs a $5000 
  engine rebuild, Yikes!
  
  3) What repair shop do people recommend in the Houston area?
  
  4) On the back of the door that closes to cover the 
  gas cap is a sticker in German that seems to be saying
  that the minimum octane fuel to be used is 98 RON/ROZ.
  Should I be using some kind of fuel additive in addition
  to the typical 92/93 octane super-unleaded?

Subject: Removing 914 Head Studs: Help wanted

 Greetings to all,
 
 Yes, the 914 engine saga continues -- I need to remove the head studs before I 
 bring the engine to FAT to get machined.  So far I have removed all eight from 
 one side of the case, but on the other side, they seem to be quite confortable 
 in their current location.  I have only been able to remove two of them.  I 
 have been using the "double nut" technique and am wondering if I should bop on 
 down to Sears and buy one of those stud pullers (device that fits to a ratchet 
 set and uses an eccentrically mounted cam-like thing to clamp the stud.)  My 
 worry is that when using a stud puller, I will end up leaving some sharp little 
 tooth marks where it clamps.  This makes me worry about causing stress 
 concentrations in the stud at those discontinuities.  Most likely this won't 
 cause problems, but the solution seems less than elegant (perhaps I should 
 polish the head studs to a mirror like finish, thus impressing all admirers who 
  crawl underneath the car and look at the shiny studs... "And the winner for 
 the People's Choice Award in the Air-cooled Division is... Tim Radsick, and his 
 Blue 914, license plate "crom stud""... sorry, too much Diet Coke....)
 
 Also, methods to loosen up the studs would be appreciated (already squirted on 
 Liquid Wrench -- no dice....)
 
 Thanks Ahead of Time,

To Everyone,
     I have a used '82  911SC Targa seat if anyone needs one.  It has a 5
inch tear in the leather in the bottom part of the seat,  but all the
mechanicals are in good shape.  Someone handy with a needle might be able to
replace the panel at a reasonable cost.  I tried to use it for a spare chair
in my rec. room, but the wife wouldn't go for it.  It's free to a good home
(you pay shipping). Or maybe someone would like to trade for the vinyl for a

You can find most of what you're looking for in the factory service manuals
and updates. Honest. The Haynes book does a respectible job of helping
with some of the measurements, but the factory book has it all. As one might
expect, if one thought about it.

Again, see the factory service manuals.

The proceedure is really simple. You can't do *ANYTHING* until the valves
are adjusted correctly. Then comes static ignition timing, then fuel pressure.
As you progress from there, what you do next depends on the car model.

Patience. If the bushings have never been done, you may have ah, an

Subject: (Un)stuck gearshift


Can anyone shed some light on the following? 

This weekend I opened the transmission on the  $1250 '72 911T that I 
lucked into a few months ago, and am now rebuilding.  You might 
remember it was stuck in one gear, either first or second, and couldn't 
be shifted.

The problem was that the ball end of the little arm on the shift 
selector rod, the arm that's accessed through the small cover plate,  
had somehow come out of the 1st/2nd -- 3rd/4th selector fork rods.  
Everything else looked fine, clean and in the right place.  I put the 
arm back in place, and can now shift through all gears (on the bench).  

My question is how did it come out?  The only thing I can think of is 
that someone really applied a lot of force, enough to pop the ball end 
out of the notches in the selector rods.

Has anyone seen this happen?  Should I do something more before 
putting it back in the car?

Thanks!

Actually, I've seen 35mpg on a tank full, preceded by a 33mpg tank and
a 34mpg tank.  This was in full track trim (other than tires) and
fully loaded for camping.  It was pretty long stretches across Nevada,
Utah and Colorado after the '90 Parade in Monterey.  Nothing fancy,
and I'm still running the same setup (except for maintance) for
autocross and time trials.  However, 25mpg is pretty good on a general
note.

Subject: correct way to adjust valves?

This weekend I had some extra time on my hands (SO was out of town) and
I figured what better way to spend the day than in the garage banging up
my knuckles.  Anyway, since the valves hadn't been adjusted in a while and
I was noticing a few more backfires than normal I figured that would be
a good project for the day.  I was a little nervous having never done this
before and having seen those nasty pictures of what happens when the
valves are too loose or too tight.  I removed the exhaust valve cover,
set the crankshaft for TDC for the first cylinder, got on my back and went
to work.  The first problem I had was getting the feeler guage between the
valve and the rocker arm.  I spent WAY too much time fiddling with it.
When I did finally get the feeler in there, there was enough oil all over
the place that I had a hard time telling when I had the correct amount of
pressure on the guage.

My questions are:
1. what is the proper procedure for getting the feeler in
correctly, should I loosen the set screw way up and go from there (what if
I just wanted to check the clearence and not necessarily set it).  I'm using
one of the blade type feelers, should I be using the "wire" types?

2. How much pressure on the feeler is enough, and should that be without
engine oil all over the place?

3. How paranoind should I be about doing this myself?  Is .005 or .003
going to cause major problems?

TIA for any help

I've found the best way to get those pesky bolts to move is to lift the 
front end off the ground to relieve the tension on the bars.  This makes 
the bolts much easier to turn.

Make sure that the cover is not hitting on the headlight blind (the little
trumpet shaped piece in the front of the assembly).  My driver's light
does this sometimes on my '74 because of rust where the two rubber points
position.

If you are not hitting the blind, one method would be to remove power to
the assembly, disengage the motor, set the proper height of the assembly
and then reinsert the motor.

When I first joined the list, I had had some repairs done and thought I had

I took the car to him.  He runs a small shop off gulfton near rice, just west

Doug,

Find another mechanic now.  Unless you misunderstood what you said, this guy 
is outright lying to you.   And to tell you to run a relatively inexpensive 
belt (although not to change) for 75K miles when the factory recommends only 
60K is just plain f*cking stupid.  And $5000 might cover the repairs, but 
not a complete rebuild.

Change mechanics and the belt now.

Subject: Got the Porsche!!!!!

Folks,

I am now the proud owner of an incredible (pardon my humility :-) 
1985 Guards Red Factory Turbo Look Porsche 911 Coupe. Oh by the way, dreams do
come true! After two days of driving I am HOOKED! I would like to 
thank the folks on the list who responded to my earlier message looking
for information. It really helped make the purchase go smoothly.

The car seemed to be
pretty stacked with options but I don't know what was standard in
85. I am very interested in determing what the price of the car
and extra goodies might have been in 1985, any information on this
would be greatly appreciated.

Particulars:
32,188 Original Miles
1985 Factory Turbo Look (amazing brakes)
Original Guards Red Paint (Looks like new)
Full Leather Interior (Black)
Power Sport Seats for Driver and Passenger
Power Sunroof
Cruise Control
Upgraded Sound System ?? (I'm not sure on this, has Blaupunkt cassette head
unit with separate Boston Acoustic Tweeters and MidRanges in the door with
Boston Acoustic 6x9's in the rear)
Headlight Washers (Do we really need this??? :-)

Other Stuff:
Chromed Wheels
B & B Aftermarket Exhaust ? (more info would be appreciated)
Lowered to Competition Height
Clifford Alarm System

I think that's IT. Half this stuff was pointed out to me by the
mechanics at Rennwerke in Elmsford NY. That's who did the pre-purchase
check out for me. 

The only thing the car needs is some new rear tires. I believe it
takes 245/55ZR16's. Can anyone recommend some tires and a process to
get them put on. Should I just go to a tire shop, or a porsche shop
or should I order the tires mail order and have a porsche or tire
shop put them on? Thanks in advance.

Well that's enough for now, I am looking forward to info on pricing
of the car. I am also interested in any books that mught be useful in 
educating myself on this beast.

Later,
Darryl

Greetings all.

So as not to embarrass myself (or GF), I'm painting my 73T targa before we 
drive up to Parade. Going back to the original Gemini Blue Metallic, in a 
Deltron base/clear. DP-40 primer, K-36 surfacer.  I'm lifting weights to get 
my arms ready for sanding :).

I have my list of seals etc.  I'm replacing the dash (if I can sell enough 
blood before July) and will start the tear down Tuesday night.

I still need a factory S bumper/spoiler, if any of you have one you'd like 
to part with.
I also need black horn grills, since the ones I have are in poor shape.

Does anyone have experience with the new Continental CH-94 tire?  I'm 
thinking of trying a set for street use.

Cool. I wasn't aware that Elmsford was big enough to have a Porsche

The normal drill is this:

1) figure out what kind of tire you want. This is a religious issue in the
   main. I, and many others, worship at the Temple of Yokohama. There
   are competing schools of thought promoted by infidels, best not discussed
   in polite company 8{)

2) call Tire Rack and get current pricing, *INCLUDING SHIPPING*.

3) call your local Large Tire Vendor that also sells your Brand of Choice
   and say "I can get these tires from Tire Rack for $x each, delieverd,
   what's YOUR best price". 

4) if they're within say 10%, not counting mounting and balancing, drive on
   over and do it; otherwise, call Tire Rack back and order your tires. If
   you order them, take them to the Large Tire Vendor or other shop for
   mounting and balancing.

Hint: find out who supports the local PCA region and do a lot of business
with them if possible. In Houston, and for that matter most places that
have one, Discount Tire is very agressive. They not only try to match Tire Rack
or Dicount Direct mail order prices on a tire, but they throw in mounting
and balancing for free to PCA members.

Caution: don't put on rear tires that are less sticky that front tires. It's
also best not to mix brands and models within brands lest your car do odd
things when pushed to the limit. If that means you need to swap all four
tires to get where you want to be, then by all means do so.

Subject: Re: 914 books (fwd)

In response to text from Brad Anders:

I had a chance the other day at Automotion to look through all of these
books. The Bosch book is a great book for learning about FI, but if your
car has D-Jetronic, the information is pretty limited. I was hoping to 
find a technical guide to D-Jetronic that had great detail on all of the 
components (i.e. complete info on each system component, electronic and
mechanical specs, etc.). L- and LH-Jetronic and K- based systems are covered
in great detail, along with Motronic. 

There are only a few differences between the L-Jetronic and the D-Jetronic
systems.  Therefore, the author makes note of the differences and states
that the L-Jet information applies to the D-Jet as well. 

The major difference is the method of measuring the air mass at the intake
manifold.  Although both systems use air temperature senders as a compensator,
the D-Jetronic uses a manifold pressure sensor and the L-Jet a vane-type
air flow sensor.

Another difference is in the fuel pressure regulator.  I believe the D-Jet
fuel pressure regulator is exposed to exterior air pressure and thus is
automatically compenesates for changes in air pressure(due to altitude, etc.)

The book does cover the manifold pressure sensor and fuel pressure regulator
in detail for the D-Jetronic system.  If memory serves, none of the details
of the control units are discussed in the book in great detail.

I've found the book to be indespensible, especially since it applies to 
almost any Porsche you'll ever own(except for the ol' 911s with MFI/carbs).

WRT this subject of FI: Has anyone on porschephiles ever made up a 914 
D-Jetronic and K-Jetronic tuning guide? I'm talking about a procedural 
guide for taking a car and putting into a base state of tune, with 914-
specific tips and specifications? Something like:

This is a good idea.  Since I will be installing my engine soon and it is
a complete rebuild, I'll be double-checking *EVERYTHING* twice from the 
ground on up.  If I take the extra time to make good notes, I could come
up with the framework for such a guide.  We could sent it around for
editing and then install it with the FAQs...

Peter,

I don't have the pedigree born of years and years of sweat and toil like some 
of the folks here, but. . .

My Dad's somewhere close to the pedigree I mentioned, and, somewhere along the 
way post-puberty (mine, that is), he decided I was trustworthy enough to drive 
his cars.  So I was fortunate enough to drive a whole series of sports(?) cars 
as he's traded and doubled up over the years (MGB, 300ZX, 944, 924, 911SC, 914, 
930--all before I was 25!).

For my money, the SC was the best overall.  Some comforts of modernity, to be 
sure, but not all stable and civilized like the 44, nor underpowered like the 
14.  The 930 is a BEAST, and is more of a super car than a sports car, 
especially if we're talking about MGB-type stripped down, no power anything, 
feel every bump and heave driving.  944 was nimble at speed (50/50 front to 
back was ultra stable), but a little ponderous in town; had all the creature 
comforts--A/C, stereo, power everything, serious soundproofing.  SC had the 
best mix of exciting am I gonna fly off the road and o.k., the windshield is 
fogging up so I should turn on the defroster since IT WORKS.  Of course, 
sitting in city traffic during the summer in the SC, you're gonna wonder, "What 
the hell am I driving this and not a 944 for?"  Not having driven a 912, I 
can't tell you how much heavier the SC would "feel".

I love the fact that _my_ 914 is a totally bare bones driving environment and 
sports car.  No frills, no stereo, even.  SC seems to keep in touch with that 
sensibility, IMH(and young)O.

P-filers:
Greetings from the Mojave Desert!
Here's a new thread I hope!  After reading some assorted articles recently on
the Beck Spyders (those well done copies of 550 spyders-for the uninitiated
among us) I began thinking: what has become of the original James Dean Spyder?
This isn't such an innocuous question: 
About two years ago, at a memorabilia swap in Los Angeles (I collect die-cast
Porsches, as well as fart around with the real thing) I had tried to buy a
nice model of an early America Roadster from this particular guy.  We got to
talking about Spyders and early Porsches in general, and he proceeded to tell
me that a certain, west coast Porsche/Ferrari dealer, was responsible for the
disappearance of the wreckage of Dean's car.  
I do remember reading elsewhere that the "'lil Bastard"'s carcass had
disappeared from whereever it had been in storage (in a rather professional
manner at that...)  I also remember reading from yet another source that James
Dean had never finished paying for the Spyder, having only traded in the
speedster that he had at the time.  this "source" went on to say that "this
dealer" had the Spyder extensively/completely restored and is in hiding
somewhere, presumably to surface when"the dealer" himself passes on.(I'm
assuming he's still with us...)  
Obviously, for everyone's protection, I ain't using any names other than
Dean's and my own.  I can't decide if this is all b******t, or if there is any
truth to this theory...does any one have any ideas?

Subject: getting manuals, etc.

I guess I need to buy a couple of things.  Specifically a hayne's manual, and
probably a set of shop manuals for my 1983 911 cabriolet.

Where do I go looking for these?  I am (finally) joining the PCA (mailed a
check today), so looking in Pano will now be possible.  Currently I get
Excellence, but I don't recall seeing a place to order a hayne's and shop
manuals from.

I guess Porsche parts dealer is the place for the shop manual set???  Are they
year/model specific?  Is there a special supplement for the cabriolet
(nearly everything else about the car seems to cost extra, why not the manuals
too??? <g>)?

If I'm going mechanic shopping, I'd at least like to know/understand what
they recommend, and I'd do a lot more stuff myself if I had some docs to
tell me how.

If you were looking to buy a car that you could transform into a 
tread burner, you made a bad decision.  Porsche, unlike GM, cheated
us Porsche owners out of cheapie upgrades to significantly boost
performance - they included all of that stuff from the factory.

Reading the rest of your post, I get the impression that you would
be alot happier with a Camaro, Mustang, etc.  In the interests of
mass production/low costs, GM and Ford left ALOT of room for
improvement in their cars.

If you would really like to develop an appreciation for the 944, take
it to a PCA driver's ed event.  Not only will its performance surprise
you, but you will be investing in the best upgrade of all - the driver.

My 914 2.0 is smoking out the valve cover vents and crank vent.
Looks like gas or water vapor, (white) not black or blue like oil.

I'm running carbs and have checked everything out with them.
(I think).  The car runs a little rough at idle, but fine under power.

I have changed the plugs and the oil, but it still smokes.  When
I changed the plugs, one looked fouled.  Could I just have a lot of
gas that got dumped in the motor, that's trying to burn off?  It
started doing it all of the sudden and would not idle until after I
changed the plugs.  

Any help is appreciated.

Dear Thwen:
I kept the old fuel injection for the 914 (one of my better decisions in 
life), so it 
only cost a couple hundred dollars for labor from my former mechanic (now 
in jail) and new vacuum hoses to reinstall it.  This was about 5 years ago.  

I just purchased a complete fuel injection for my 1976 911S from 
Performance Wholesale for $450, and it's in very good shape.  It cost 
about $400 for the labor to reinstall it.  I also bought a new fuel pump 
because I didn't want to install one with unknown history, new hoses, and 
a fuel accumulator.  So I guess it's about $1200 to trash the carbs.  A 
914 should be somewhat cheaper, especially if you do the work yourself 
(or call my former mechanic in Rayford prison, somewhere in Northern 
Florida!).

I'd recommend calling all the used parts dealers in Panorama and 
Excellence.  I'm sure that you can come up with FI for a 914.

I only wish that the Porschephiles collective knowledge base was 
available years ago when I made that warped decision to install carbs.  
I would be about $1200 richer (parts and labor to install carbs - then 
reinstall FI), and spared untold aggrevation.

(Car had been idleing (sp?) at high rpm, 1500-2000rpm, when driven hard at

Porsche will not stall after 10 minutes of driving, but will idle very

I painted my burgundy-orange-red-white-black-light grey
 -dark grey 914-6 last week....now it's mostly white.  I painted
it to provide some sort of rust protection, and to make it
one colour so it isn't too much of an eye-sore.  I won't be
doing the final bodywork until later this summer, or next year
so this is a temporary paint job.

This was my 1st time painting a car and I learned many things...

1)  Wear a baseball hat or *ANYTHING* to cover your head,
unless you like "interesting" hair.

2)  No matter how well you think you sealed off a partition in
the garage, cover everything else outside of your "plastic paint
booth" because the paint WILL find its way onto the car being
worked on in the other half of the garage.  In my case it took
about 3 hours of washing and waxing a black 911 targa since
it now looked "grey"!!!  Ooops....  :-)

3)  Mix the paint VERY well before proceeding....what you
see in the can is what you get.  A beige colour in a can of
gloss white paint will actually come out beige.

4)  Enamel paint may be cheap, but is a b*tch to spray,
especially if you've never done so before.

5)  Seal off the bottom of the car (ie engine area) unless
you like a painted engine.  It's amazing how much that
paint mist gets into everything.

6)  Painting a car in a cramped garage isn't the best idea.
You may discover you need to be in awkward positions to
paint, and this may result in runs, and having a greasy
air hose fall against your wet fender (BT,DT).

7)  You need good lighting to see what you're doing.

8)  Flies like the smell of the paint.  If one lands on your
wet paint, picking it out will definitely show.  I picked
out the first fly, then realized my attempt to "fix" it
didn't work, so I then painted over the next few flies
that landed on my car.  Perhaps in a million years
some future scientist can extract the DNA of a fly
encased on my car and clone it.

My car is a mix of various shades of "white" and also
ranging from "gloss" to "flat", with a couple of good-sized
runs on it.  From a distance it looks great, get a little
closer and you'll see it for what it is - a temporary
paint job worth every penny I paid for it!  :-)

But it was fun.....I'd do it again, but with laquer paint
or some other type which has the sanding/polishing
features of the laquer.  I'd also rent a spray booth
and wear a baseball hat!!!   :-)

Well, in all honesty - I don't think anyone can look at the upgrade 
potential of a vehicle as a disadvantage.   "Cheapie" or not, a Paxton 
garners REAL HP, no matter what brand of car it's on.  Someone else 
mentioned in this thread that there IS a Paxton kit for 944!   It seems 
to me that unless your Porsche is force-fed, then there's one thing 
missing from the factory.

I am very fond of Porsches indeed, and I wouldn't for a second insist 
that the quality of a GM product comes close in terms of refinement, but 
I wouldn't say that the new Camaros "leave a lot of room for 
improvement."  After the past 20 years of Camaros, I can't say that I was 
very fond of Camaros, but the latest genre is an admirable performer (in 
most quantifiable regards) and inarguably one of the best values on the 
planet in terms of bang for the buck.  As a Porsche owner (now), I can't 
look at the industry from a one-sided perspective and totally condemn 
what the cheap Yankee rides achive.  However, I admit I'd take a 911 over 
one anyday - who wouldn't, save for some gear-head Chevy man who thinks 
Porsches are overpriced and too difficult/impossible to modify to run
low 12's.

I really do appreciate the 944 already!  I was just poking into the 
never-ending quest for more HP.  However, even in its stock form, my 944 
is a quick car if you bang the gearshift at the right revs.  There's a 
lot of pretenders out there (even some of the more "wuss" V-8s) that 
can't accelerate as quickly as the little SOHC 2.5.  Most anything out of 
Detroit from late 70's to mid-80's is a joke and even a 944 can toast 'em!

> Reading the rest of your post, I get the impression that you would
> be alot happier with a Camaro, Mustang, etc.

I don't know.  I'm going to stick with the Porsche for a while; it's new 
and feels sort of "exotic" (to overuse a word) to me.

However - just because I like HP that sinks the eyeballs in the skull 
doesn't mean that I'm some Chevy man who can't appreciate the unique 
qualities of a Porsche.  My real surprise stems from my humble Volkswagen 
beginnings.  My first car was a VW Bug, and despite all the laughs and 
jokes from the Chevy guys, I cleaned a number of clocks and blew some big 
Detroit iron away with 2-liters of normally-aspirated VW air-cooled 
power.  I had dual Webers and dual valve springs (etc. etc.) and never 
even got into turbos.  Seeing that Porsche always seemed like a "big 
brother" to VW, my surprise was that my 2-liter Bug ran low 15's and my 
2.5 liter Porsche - well...I don't know what it runs, but even with a VW 
Bug - question is:  How fast do you want to go?  There was nothing like 
watching the laughs turn to frowns when their 289 cid V8 got walloped by 
a air-cooled 4-banger...heh heh heh.

My first suspicion would be that your are too rich on the mixture.  Try

Replacing fouled plugs with good ones will help for a while, until the

With the announcement and arrival of the 996 in 1997, would not all 911's with
air cooled motors increase in value.  Certainly the 993, which would be the
last model years for the "Classic" motor.  Don't get me wrong, I did not
purchase my 911 for the investment, I bought it to drive.  IMHO cars, boats,
houses, and such are terrible investments.
 
Why buy something to make money on that was built to be used, and requires
maintenance to replace items that wear out.

The '87 and later Carerras have the G-50 transmission.  I've been told that
all G-50s make a groaning vibration noise at low speed when under load.
Mine does.

Other than the noise, it's a strong transmission; it's also used on the 930
of the same period.  And the G-50 syncros seem hold up better than the
earlier 915.  But the clutch had some problems that were apparently fixed
in various updates over the years.  My clutch was replaced (by the previous
owner) at 45K miles.

You should have a special Porsche feeler gauge with a bent handle 
and replaceable blades (buy a half-dozen spare blades when you
get the gauge). Some guys grind the handles to provide 
additional clearance. Yes, you should loosen the adjusting screw
a lot so that you can easily get the feeler gauge in.

It should be snug, but not so tight that the blade chatters when
you push or pull. Oil doesn't matter.

Good luck. It helps ease the frustation if you think up creative
tortures for the engineer responsible for the maintenance-unfriendly
design. He's probably the same guy responsible for the allen-head 
screws on the cam housings - when he designed the castings he didn't 
leave enough room for regular bolt heads.

Hi Everyone,

First off thanks to 911 owners and supporters for all the great responses to
my questions about getting my first 911, and thanks also to the water pumpers
who tried to talk me out of it, don't worry I'm not telling who you are! :-) I
don't want to see anybody who is sharing their honest feelings to get Flamed.

which seemed to run "Don't do it on your(Brian's) budget :-( VS. the response
to my post, for which the consensus was "GO FOR IT!"

After reading the responses to Brian's post my S.O. is really worried, but I
think I may have found a compromise to start with .... a '76 912E.  At least
it's a 911 body, and with the Type IV motor I think we can get it repaired
even out here!  And I can write a check for one! DLIsPF :-))  I seen several
posts for the '76 912, they seem to be running (asking) 6.6k(straight Driver)
to about 12K for "pristine".  What's this car really like?, what's a fair
price?, should I hold out for an SC?,  will a912E hold it's value?, i.e. can I
drive it for a couple of years and then trade up without losing a bunch of
$'s?  I like the fact that if I scatter the engine I can buy one complete for
less than the top end on a 3.2!  I'd like to hear the pro's,  con's and
history of this car.  And yes, if you know of a "good" one for sale, your
welcome to write as well.  

Still Looking!

Subject: re: 914 gas mileage

I had to put in my 1/50th dollar on this one, since I just made a 1000+
mile trip in my 1.7L 914, and got 37mpg.  I will grant you, this is
all highway, and I never really drove hard, just 65-70mph.  This car
has the stock FI but has (I think) 135000 miles on it.  The key to getting
good mileage should be to keep the tuning good, adjust those valves,
make sure the fuel pressure is within range, and check that pressure
sensor (D-jet only) for leaks by blowing in it.  As I recall, my 2.0
from years back would only do about 30 under similar circumstances,
but I think it was more worn out, too.

Dear Chris,

The 912E was made strictly for the US market as a stopgap between the
phaseout of the 914 and the introduction of the 924.  It seems to have
held its value very well, as the car sold for about $12-13K when new.
If you get a nice one and keep it that way it should not go down at
all; in fact, since there were relatively few of them, its value may
in fact go up.  It's already done better in that department than the
911.

The upside is the easy maintenance and economy of operation.  The
downside is performance:  the engine of a 914 in a heavier body.
That's why it would never do in Europe, where a Porsche would be
expected to perform nearer its limit on a daily basis.  If you're
talking performance, there's no comparison.  If you want a car with
the eyeball of a 911 and the economy of a VW, then the 912E might be
for you.  I don't know of any for sale, but look for a stock one with
no accidents, maybe even original paint.  Finding a nice example with
a motivated seller may not be easy.

Good luck.

Subject:       Porsche Dealers From Hell


Hi folks. I sent this to Gary Cook earlier, when I was still even 
*more* wound up, and with his advice, I have edited it for general 
consumption. I hope I removed a sufficient number of expletives and 
I *still* might send it to the Globe and Mail, Canada's nearest 
substitute to the Wall Street Journal  ;- )

I have owned a 1981 924 Turbo since 1989 and with the help of Gary, 
Kelvin, Paul, a bunch more fellow $931-ers, and Pfiles, I have managed 
to keep my car running most of the time even though I haven't always 
tricked the Bank Balance Sensor, and even repaired most of the damage 
done in the past, by often highly recommended Porsche, specialists. I 
have like most well seasoned $931-ers, been sorely tempted to burn 
this sucker to the ground on more than one occasion but so far, that 
first on-ramp has been sufficient to stave off my wrath. Still, the 
car keeps it alias -WCFH, The White Car From Hell...

In my early experiences, I knew very little about where to get good 
service, or parts but I slowly caught on. I eventually became a 
Stoddard's Fan Club Member, even though I had to endure the 
ridiculous import duties, shipping charges, and lag time of having 
parts sent over the border to Canada. They are in my opinion great. 
Generally a lot cheaper than the Canadian dealers and always 
plaeasant to talk to whether I want to buy parts, or pick their 
service guys brains for guidance. My experiences with other American 
dealers has been quite similar. No complaints.

Well, I am a poor graduate student, trying to feed one of Porsche's 
more hungry models, and now that the exchange rate has become so 
dreadful, it has become more difficult to continue buying parts 
across the border. Now it is further complicated by the fact that I 
am commuting every week between Toronto and Kingston and I only have 
the weekends to repair whatever goes wrong on the week's 300 mile 
flog fest so I find it more difficult to wait a week or so for parts 
delivery. Therefore I have found myself at the mercy of a few Toronto 
dealerships to a much greater extent than I would ever have chosen. 
My first exposure to these guys was with a dealer called Pfaff, who 
not only wanted $40 (CDN) each for 4 parts that I obtained across the 
border for about $11 (CDN) each, but also insisted in an uncalled for 
surly manner that I first FAX my credit card information before 
he would bother himself to process my order. I didn't bother to call 
there since that first treatment.

I have had reasonable treatment from Downtown Fine Cars, but they no 
longer seem to stock *anything* but must order it which means a 
minimum 4 day wait. Yes I know it is an old car. But 4 days for a 
G.D. filter!!!  :-(

Subject:       Pcar dealers from Hell.

Hi Gary. I am still steaming from my latest visit to the local 
Porsche dealer here in Toronto. *So* pissed off that I am going to 
write a letter to Volkswagen  Canada over this *&%$. I scoured 
all over trying to find that vacuum limiter thingy here in town. 
Stoddard's listed it at about $75. I Checked around locally to find a 
used one and quickly figured that the time I was spending was adding 
up to the dealer price pretty quickly, so I called two of the Toronto 
dealers, as well as some Bosch places. Both dealers had the same 
price tag. $134.xx (CDN). Both required 4 days to get it in stock. It 
was running so crappy that I figured it would *have* to be done over 
the weekend so I didn't want to wait 4 days unnecessarily. I called 
another dealer. Same price. BUT, he had it on the shelf. AND he was 
not far out of my way on the way home to Kingston! :^)
I drive up in front of his place and park among the 911's and 968's 
etc. There is a guy out front washing the glass front of the place 
so that I can't get to the front door. He ignores me. Just then I 
remember I have a fragment of what I believe is part of the innards 
of the vacuum limiter, in the car so I do an about face and retrieve 
the bit of rubber. This time he looks up long enough to growl that  
the service entrance is in the back. I go to the back and find the 
garage bays open and make my way through to the parts counter. The 
parts guy has his back to me and is talking on the phone. No 
acknowledgement yet. Finally the uhhh...extremely friendly guy from 
the front makes his way back through and sees that I am still 
standing there. Asks me if he can help me. I tell him that I suspect 
I need a vacuum limiter, and 
holding out the bit of rubber, I explain that I found it in the 
throat of the auxiliary air regulator and ask 
if he thinks my guess as to its source is reasonable. "NEVER SEEN 
ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE" , he snarls. "I've never had an auxiliary 
air regulator apart." I calmly explain  that it is definitely not 
part of the aux. air reg. (I didn't get smart and tell him that I 
was more curious than he, and I had in fact taken an auxiliary air 
regulator apart before) but I am reasonably confident that it is 
from the Vacuum limiter, and considering how far I am from home, 
and 
how expensive the part is, I would feel more comfortable if he or one 
of his mechanics were able to identify the piece. This is where his 
cork pops. "WeLL! I am LUDWIG HEIMRATH!! AND IF I HAVEN"T SEEN THAT 
BEFORE THEN THE MECHANICS HAVEN"T SEEN IT EITHER BECAUSE I AM THE 
HEAD MECHANIC AND I TAUGHT THEM *EVERYTHING* THEY KNOW!!!!!! SEE THIS 
GUY HERE AT THE PARTS COUNTER. He will sell you anything you want! If 
you think you can diagnose a turbocharged Porsche, then I wish you 
luck! These guys who work on them everyday find it is sometimes 
difficult! There! Let him fix you up! I can tell you that I have 
never had to replace one of those things on a car yet! "
Knowing that this total fucking asshole has the only in stock one of 
these damned things, I keep my cool. I don't tell him that I 
have 100,000 miles of personal experience with this piece of 
shit, nor do I tell him that I have the collective experience of 
all of the rest of the $931-ers on Pfiles and perhaps if he had 
an I.Q. even marginally above room temperature, he might learn 
things from the people who drive *and* fix these damned things. 
No. I keep quiet. After he nips around the corner, 
I ask the parts guy why his boss is so obnoxious? He informs 
me right away that Heimrath doesn't *have* to sell *anything* to 
anybody. Besides, they do all the diagnosis in the back. If they had 
to answer questions from owners all the time they would need two more 
full time people. I 
bite my tongue. I make no comment about getting a hell of a lot 
more help from Stoddard's and neither do I comment about the 
wonderful and enthusiastic assistance I have grown accustomed to 
from fellow Porsche enthusiasts. I shove my MasterCard across the 
counter to pay still not providing any indication as to just how 
steamed I really am. He sneers and tells me that "they don't accept 
MasterCard. Only Visa."  
"Where's the nearest cash machine?" I politely inquire. He directs me 
across the  street to a Royal Bank. I return with the bucket full of 
cash. While paying I *sweetly* inform The Twerp that I am on the 
network with a 
*lot* of other _Porsche enthusiasts_ and I have become accustomed to 
Porsche people being very helpful, and friendly and that's why I 
found it difficult to understand why _Heimrath_ was behaving like 
such a TFA. "But. THAT'S NOT A PORSCHE!!!!", The obnoxious 
bloody Twerp snarls. Miraculously, I don't wollop him over the head 
with the gold plated part, but bite down hard on my tongue, vowing to 
get even somehow.
Apparently everybody around here knows this guy is an asshole. The 
next closest dealer, Pfaff, is hardly superior. 
Heimrath used to race for Porsche back when there were no Canadian 
racers and he made a lot of money. Now they still think it is ok for 
him to treat customers like shit or do whatever the hell he pleases. 
Volkswagen Canada has the whole game up here. I was told by a VW 
dealer that they are in deep shit all across Canada because none of 
their cars are getting off the lots. This is the third Canadian 
dealer I have encountered up here and NONE of them have made it above 
a grade of shitty, where service is concerned. 
This is a new low though. I am still wound up just thinking about it! 
I definitely will write a bleeding letter to the idiots.
I always thought I'd like a 911, but maybe those BMW's, Nissan's and 
so on deserve a much more serious look when I finally have deeper 
pockets. I really think the days when luxury car dealers could 
get away with that nonsense are gone. At least I hope they are. >:=> 
Grrrrrr.... Latuh. Ken.


P.S. It _was_ a faulty vacuum limiter. The car runs better and I took 
the limiter apart to see what makes it tick. Of course if I was a 
perfect mechanic like Heimrath, or if I only was allowed to know what 
He taught me, I'd know that  the person who drives and fixes the car 
couldn't possibly know anything about this car and therefore 
the problems are just my imagination. Gary, it's like the Pcar guy 
you talked to in Reno... "Vee haf no problems vis hower kars!"  ;-)

Subject: Re: Questions

I get a similar sort of sound in my antique '79 928. Emissions are
clean as a white sheet, which makes me think it's not valve-related
(correct me if this conclusion is unwarranted). The "guy at the
Porsche place" thinks it's the airpump. It does not, in fact, seem to
be emanating from the block at all, but rather slightly in front of
it, and below the level of the valves. Pop the hood and see if you can
localize the sound. I ran into a guy today who's stripping an '84 928
for racing purposes, and he commented that the rocker arms in these
engines have a tendancy to stick. He also checked my oil level to make
sure I wasn't some sort of idiot :-).

98 RON =~ 94 US Octane (CLC). I would think it's quite OK to use 93
octane fuel as is. Go much above that and you're talking about
airplane fuel, which is 2+ bucks a gallon and 100 (RON, I guess?).

I have seen additives that turn unleaded into leaded (or
pseudo-leaded?) gas in the supermarket, but are there octane boosters?
It sure would be nice to pay $1.25/gallon for 92+ octane gas!

Subject: 944 Brake Question

Hi everyone,
My '84 944's brakes just started acting strange last night, and I'm 
wondering if anyone can explain.  I drove the car about 100 miles, with 
some stop-and-go toward the end, with no problem.  At the end of the 
trip, it idled for about five minutes, then I moved it again to park it.  
At this point, I noticed that the brake pedal felt mushy and seemed to 
depress a couple inches farther down than usual.  It did not hit the 
floor, and I was able to park with no problem.
	Today I turned on the ignition (but not the engine) and pressed down 
on the brake pedal.  It felt the same as it always did before last 
night.  Then I went looking for any brake fluid leaks.  Pulled all four 
wheels, examined the reservoir, master cylinder, etc.  I couldn't find 
any, and the reservoir is as full as always-right between the min. and 
max. markers.  The only strange thing I found is that when I jiggle the 
plastic brake fluid reservoir from side to side, I can see a little fluid 
squishing in the seam where the plastic meets the top of the master 
cylinder.  It doesn't drip, but fluid is visible.  Is this supposed to be 
tightly sealed?  The dealer who 
checked the car when I bought it 6 months ago did not mention anything.  
	Is it possible that air is somehow entering the system?  How can 
I test this?  I obviously don't want to drive it until I find out what 
happened....
	Just remembered this-may not be relevent-I parked last night with 
the nose of the p-car facing up about a 15% grade.  Today when I tested 
the brakes it was on a flat surface. ??

Thanks in advance for any help!

Don't get me wrong, I don't look at investment potential when I decide upon

should be irresistible!
Heck, doesn't have to be on the top 10 list, if it copes with the Bank

I get a similar sort of sound in my antique '79 928. Emissions are 
clean as a white sheet, which makes me think it's not valve-related 
(correct me if this conclusion is unwarranted). The "guy at the 
Porsche place" thinks it's the airpump. It does not, in fact, seem to 
be emanating from the block at all, but rather slightly in front of 
it, and below the level of the valves. Pop the hood and see if you can 
localize the sound. I ran into a guy today who's stripping an '84 928 
for racing purposes, and he commented that the rocker arms in these 
engines have a tendancy to stick. He also checked my oil level to make 
sure I wasn't some sort of idiot :-).
     
98 RON =~ 94 US Octane (CLC). I would think it's quite OK to use 93 
octane fuel as is. Go much above that and you're talking about 
airplane fuel, which is 2+ bucks a gallon and 100 (RON, I guess?).
     
I have seen additives that turn unleaded into leaded (or 
pseudo-leaded?) gas in the supermarket, but are there octane boosters? 
It sure would be nice to pay $1.25/gallon for 92+ octane gas!

Subject: 944 Brake Question
     
Hi everyone,
My '84 944's brakes just started acting strange last night, and I'm 
wondering if anyone can explain.  I drove the car about 100 miles, with 
some stop-and-go toward the end, with no problem.  At the end of the trip, 
it idled for about five minutes, then I moved it again to park it.  At 
this point, I noticed that the brake pedal felt mushy and seemed to 
depress a couple inches farther down than usual.  It did not hit the 
floor, and I was able to park with no problem.
 Today I turned on the ignition (but not the engine) and pressed down 
on the brake pedal.  It felt the same as it always did before last 
night.  Then I went looking for any brake fluid leaks.  Pulled all four 
wheels, examined the reservoir, master cylinder, etc.  I couldn't find 
any, and the reservoir is as full as always-right between the min. and 
max. markers.  The only strange thing I found is that when I jiggle the 
plastic brake fluid reservoir from side to side, I can see a little fluid 
squishing in the seam where the plastic meets the top of the master 
cylinder.  It doesn't drip, but fluid is visible.  Is this supposed to be 
tightly sealed?  The dealer who 
checked the car when I bought it 6 months ago did not mention anything.  
 Is it possible that air is somehow entering the system?  How can 
I test this?  I obviously don't want to drive it until I find out what 
happened....
 Just remembered this-may not be relevent-I parked last night with 
the nose of the p-car facing up about a 15% grade.  Today when I tested 
the brakes it was on a flat surface. ??
     
Thanks in advance for any help!

Subject: Re: 911 - Cooling Fan/Alternator Noise


Hi,

About your cooling fan/alternator...

For the rattle, check to make sure the fan belt pulley which is
bolted to the fan and alternator shaft is not loose.  I just installed
a new alternator in my 1981 911SC last week, and I forgot to completely
tighten down that shaft bolt.  When the engine was running, it made
a rattling noise.  This bolt should be snug.  It may be hard to tell if
its tight.  Try this - with the engine at idle, open the rear engine
trunk lid and listen for rattle.  If nothing, remove the oil cap from
the oil fill spout.  This will decrease the RPM's of the car and slow
the engine, due to the drop in oil pressure in the oil tank.  
With this decrease or change in RPM's you may hear the rattle.  You
can put the oil cap on then off then on then off, etc and isolate the
rattle.  My rattle from this loose fan/pulley nut would only appear
under changing RPM's, and this slight change allows you to detect it.

Also, check to make sure the fan itself is not rubbing on the fan housing.
This may be from something that hit the housing hard and deformed or dented
it.

Next, get a socket that fits the nut on the alternator shaft, loosen it,
to release the pulley and belt.  Be careful, there are some thin washers
on BOTH sides of that pulley.  Keep track of how many washers are on each
side of this pulley - this determines belt tension by allowing the pulley
to increase or decrease the distance that the belt must ride up or down
inside of its track between the pulley and the fan.  With the nut loose
and the belt off, the fan, and alternator shaft should spin freely and
swiftly by hand - without the feel of any resistance except its initial
weight inertia.  Try wiggling the shaft to see if the alternotr bearings
are shot.  If so, you probably need to replace the alternator, or if you
are a master mechanic and electrician, it is possible to rebuild the
alternator with just the needed parts.

Changing the alternator in a 911 is a job most people can do and it will
save them prpobably $200-300 in labor.  I can send you info (or the list) on
how easy it is to do if you would like.  Another list member helped me
out (H. Wilson Busby - thanks!) with detailed instructions he posted
about 2 weeks ago.  I bought a new alternator from Europroducts for $235.
You can get rebuilt ones for about $150.  Your is a 1971 911 so it may
be less - these even may be VW alternators???  The ONLY tools I needed
were a flat head scrwedriver, the rachet and socket for the fan pulley
nut, a 10 mm wrench, a 13 mm wrench, and an 8 mm wrench.  Also, an alan
wrech that fit the hex nut which held the fan housing clamp in place -
but your car will have 2 bolts instead of this hex nut I think.  I had
to remove and re-wire the alternator 3 times last week, and I got it
down to under 15 minutes to remove it on my third try.  Works fine now,
my windows (passenger side too) go up real fast!!

Dear Mr Beuselinck

Her majesty ha asked me to write to you on her behalf.

Mam is rather tissed auf with you claiming to supply her with recycled 
944 parts.

Mam wishes it to be known that whilst she has been known to wear wellies 
to feed the corgis, she has never-ever attempted to service german 
machinery, in fact he is greek. The stories about the german seem to stem 
from a misunderstanding, the german machinery was only being used for 
evaluation and was rejected when it was realised that metric screws did 
not have the reliability and longevity of the imperial hardened steel stud.

To quote her highness, "not much sense in putting in one of those 5mm 
jobs where an alf inch whitworth has already been".

Her highness suggests that in future, you modify your patronage claim, 
she is sure that you may claim to have supplied her daughters in law. 
They are both quite happy to experiment with used parts and their wide 
and varied vast experience in this area has often been used to foster 
improved anglo-german relations.

There's another downside: maintenence. It's a one-year only car, there
were not very many made, it was never popular so no one stockpiled parts
and guess what? Many of the SPECIAL one-year only parts that adapt the
914 2.0 engine to the 911 body are truely no longer available.

Don't get me wrong, I really like the cars (even contemplated racing

Subject: 911 Heel and toeing


Hey,

While "fondling" my 911 this weekend (as my wife likes to call it),
I decided to try to adjust the relative position of my brake pedal
to allow me to heel and toe.  The problem I had (and from what
I can tell, it is a common 911 problem) is that even under hard
braking, my brake pedal was too far above the accelerator to
allow me to heel and toe.  Well, I seem to have fixed the problem.
I adjusted the brake pedal "down" a bit and was even able to
bring the accelerator closer to me by adjusting the threaded rod
that connects the pedal to the linkage just above the pedal assy.

It didn't take much adjustment at all.  Now I can easily blip the
throttle while braking.  This is an *easy* thing to do if anyone else
has this same problem.  I heard all kinds of fixes from screwing
blocks to the gas pedal to attaching another pedal on top of the old
one.  This works fine as long as you don't need alot of adjustment
(I moved each pedal about 3mm).

FWIW, YMMV, et al...

It's hard to test a 911 by bouncing it because they are quite stiff
and the bushings and sway bars tend to bind it up.

I checked mine last week with the following method. It takes more
work, but it's the only way to really check them.

Jack up one side, remove the wheel, and disconnect the sway bar
(another reason people like the older 911s better -sway bar design
is better and easier to work on). You may not need to disconnect
the sway bar, but it lets you lower the suspension arm more.

Now open the hood and remove the big nut on the top of the shock rod.
You may first have to flatten the lock washer. Be careful that the suspension
does not fall down hard when you remove the nut!

Now from below, pull down on the top of the shock to compress it and
pull it out of the top mount. If it's a Bilstein (high pressure) you really
have to pull hard.

Now you can feel the shock through it's full range of travel. There should be
no weak points or sounds. The shock should be very firm. If not, you are
halfway done with it's removal!

This happened to me a few years ago on my 1981 911SC.  It turned out
to be the fuel pump check valve.  Was the car warm when you shut it off
and then did you wait a while (say 15-20 minutes) and then it would not
start?  If so, let it crank for about 10-15 seconds, and the fuel will
finally reach the fuel injectors and fire up.  If the check valve is bad,
your may need to replace the fuel pump.  If it did not start first thing
in the morning, it may be the cold start valve.

From: ben@wet.sbi.com (Ben Evans)
Subject: Taking the Piss


I was pulled up in my 911 on the A23 fifteen or so miles
outside of Brighton by a large marked Police Jag several days ago. 
The offence was "Taking the Piss", "Taking the Piss in a Red 
Porsche 911" to be precise!

What happened was that I was in a hell of a hurry to get
down to the south coast for my flying lesson, cruised past
the Jag until he was half a mile back and round some bends, 
figured that he was not interested in me, and nailed the throttle 
through my favourite set of sweepers that go up through the South Downs.
El Big Mistake!

Three or four miles further on I saw a tiny white spec in 
my mirror, Oops, I lifted off and slowed down as the tiny 
white dot started to become rather larger very fast indeed. 
Too late, much, much too late. Various scenarios sped through
my mind "Yes, you got me bang to rights Guv, I was the one
wot done it, you got me red handed", or perhaps "you'll Never
take me alive copper, on top of the world Ma!, hahahahaha" or
perhaps "let him have it, Derick" all of which seem to
have been employed in the past. I considered all options, and 
there was no doubt that this was a sticky wicket.

The officer explained to me that I had averaged 89 MPH over 
the distance that he had pursued me, and that since I had 
passed him at 79 MPH and had been pulled up at 70 MPH I must 
have been going indecently fast in order to average 89 MPH.

He also explained to me that he regarded this as "Taking 
the Piss", an offence that I had not heard of before, but 
which sounded sufficiently naughty for me to decide that 
perhaps I should not explain that I was actually holding the 
afformentioned Red 911 back at the time, and that
really it was at it's best at 120 or 130 through the sweepers.

The Officer was suprised that I had Taken the Piss to such an 
extent, and I mentioned to him that I too was suprised at the 
extent and henious nature of of my crime, and I mentioned that 
I had no real explanation for Flouting The Law in such a grave 
and dastardly fashion except for oversight and the human condition. 

I discussed with him the remarkable nature of the oversight, 
considering that they were driving such a large and obvious 
Police Motor Car in the legitimate pursuit of collecting taxes, 
it really was inexplicable and remarkably clear that I had Made A 
Big Mistake.

The Officer asked for documents, all I had was my Class 3 CAA 
Medical Cert. I handed it to the officer, who inquired as to my 
destination, which I indicated as Shoreham Airport. The officer 
then wanted to know what kind of flying machine I was receiveing 
instruction in?, "Fixed wing or rotary?" were his very words. 

Well let me tell you, "Fixed wing or rotary?" is not something the 
non-airhead Police Officer will say to a citizen who has admitted 
Taking the Piss in a public place, and who is all ready to be taxed. 

No indeedie, "fixed-wing or rotary?" is airhead talk! Sensing that 
Perhaps There Is a God After All I mentioned that I was a fixed wing 
student pilot, and he inquired as to perhaps whether I was late for 
my lesson. "Why yes I am" I replied, to which he responded that 
perhaps I had better be Getting On My Way, because It Really Would 
Not Do to be late for one's flying lesson.

Yep, no ticket, no license points, no extra tax to pay, just the 
stern admonishment not to be late. The offence of Taking the Piss 
seemed to have evaporated like AVGAS in the breeze, and I jumped 
in the Red 911 and made excellent time. Yes, perhaps there is a 
God after all.

I checked with my local P-car dealer's parts dept a few weeks ago and they

I'm in the market for a set of these myself, but holding out for a better

 Your local P-Car dealer's parts dept has a kit for about $340 + painting
 costs. I too am in the market for turbo mirrors, but holding out for
 a less costly set of mirrors. I think that another P-philer, Scott Kelly
 might also be interested in a set, so maybe we could work a deal with
 some parts supplier for 3 sets. 

 Anyone else want a set?

If you have multiple cans of paint, don't take the chance that they don't 
match.  Box them.  That is, mix a whole can with half a can, then keep adding
to the mixture before it runs out.  Ideally, you'd have a 5 gallon bucket and 
mix a couple gallons at a time.

You should probably use a paint strainer, too.  Helps keep the spray gun from 
clogging, cause when it does the paint still comes out, just not in a mist and 
you get big, uneven, drops.

Subject: Gas tank leak


I just discovered the source of that overpowering smell of gas in my 69 912 
is a leak around the seal where the fuel gauge screws into the top of the 
gas tank.  It looks like the previous owner put some sort of brown epoxy 
around the seal which makes me think he was either too lazy to replace the 
gasket or he did replace it and that didn't work.  What's the best thing to 
do here?  If I "re-epoxy" it what should I use?  Is there something that 
will make a good seal without fusing these pieces together for eternity?

Subject: RE: 951 cold idle problem

John- 

Although I have never worked on a Porsche DME box, I have fixed plenty of
other temperature-related electronics problems.  Success rate is generally
about 60-70% if you are patient and careful.

Most temperature-related problems in electronic equipment are due to simple
thermal expansion and contraction.  Something in there has developed a crack,
come loose, or otherwise developed excessive tolerance between parts that are
supposed to be in electrical contact.  At cold temperatures, the parts contract
and the electrical contact is broken or increases in resistance.

Some things to check are - 

Contacts - check the pins on the main connector for wear, spreading, or other damage.
If these are ok, remove the box from the car place it on a grounded worksurface.  
Ground yourself with an ESD wriststrap (available at Radio Shack for a couple dollars), 
and carefully open the box.  Check internal connections first.  If there are any socketed
chips, carefully press them down into their sockets.

Solder Joints - Remove the board from the case if possible and check all solder 
connections, including the ones where components are soldered to the board.  
They should be bright and shiny, with good mechanical contact between the solder 
and the component leads.  Look for dull, corroded connections, or for tiny, hairline 
cracks between component leads and the solder.  If you find a bad or suspect connection, 
you could have a pro resolder it, but it is not that hard to it yourself.  Use a fine tip,
 low wattage iron (25 watts or so), NOT a soldering gun!  Use an iron with a "grounded 
tip" to avoid stray voltages which can damage components.  Heat the component lead (not 
the solder) until the solder flows freely around the lead (a tiny drop of solder between 
the iron and the lead will speed heat transfer and make it much easier).  If possible, 
use a heat sink between the iron and the actual component (hemostats or self closing 
tweezers work well).  When you are done, the solder joint must be clean, shiny, and well 
adhered to all parts.  If not, clean it up as best you can and repeat the process.

Components - If the above do not find the problem, it is most likely a mechanical
defect within a component.  Chips have tiny wires inside them which connect the 
external leads to the IC die itself, and these sometimes become partially detached.  
You cannot repair a chip, but you can replace one if you can determine which chip 
is causing the problem.  Or, a resistor or other component may have developed a 
temperature-related problem.  Reinstall the box with the cover off and start the car.  
Now use a freezing spray (available at any electronics shop) to chill each component 
in the box, one by one.  If you find the one that is causing the problem, start by 
inspecting it extra closely for any external mechanical problem.  If none is obvious, 
it is most likely internal, and you will need to get a replacement.  The box will likely 
contain a mix of standard, off-the-shelf parts and Bosch proprietary parts.  If you
are lucky, the problem will be caused by a readily available part.  Look for part
numbers that start with an SN or an LS (i.e. SN7400, LS7400, etc.) - these indicate 
standard, readily available chips.  Or bring the box to your local electronics store,
point out the bad part, and ask the counterman if it is available.  If you are not 
an experienced solderer, it probably would pay to have a pro install it.  If the part
is Bosch proprietary, you may still be able to get it from a junked DME box (it doesn't
necessarily have to be from a Porsche box, as long as it is the exact same part).  Try 
your local junkyards, or ask here on Porschephiles, giving as much info about the part 
as you can (part number, size, number of leads, etc.).  Some Bosch proprietary parts may
have been used in many years and models, and so will be readily available, others 
may be tougher to find.

Good luck, hope you find it.

For the TechTips one, it must be simply in the format of JPEG or GIF87a

Hi, Charlie,

Look for a vacuum leak... I know that's a lot to ask for on a 951, but the 
likely culprit.

Make sure that the clamps on the hoses leading to the intercooler are tight, 
and that no 
hoses have loosened...

Subject: tensioners - 83 911

I've rolled past 95000 miles quite happily with my nearly stock 1983 911 SC
Cabriolet.  I'm going in for major service thursday.  I hae a couple of 
questions:

The place I'm taking it is trying to talk me into an $1100 tensioner update
and chain replacement (he says it is needed at 100,000 miles).

There has been a lot of talk about these lately, EXACTLY what is the best
thing to do here (part numbers if possible).  I've seen stuff about
spacers, arms of different thickness, etc and it has just confused me, so
what is the best update to make?

I never had an owner's manual, so what needs doing at this mileage?  I am 
assuming the following:

last major work done at 78000 included:
  front brake pads
  pack all 4 cv joints
  new clutch cable
  set suspension all around
  new tires
  new rear torsion bars (broke one!)
  fluids, etc


This time around I'm doing the following:
  Rear brake pads (fronts are new at last service)
  brake fluid flush and change
  Oil & filter
  trans oil change
  clutch adjust (although it was done at last service too)
  valve adjust
  starter replace (intermittent failure due to probably worn bushings)

  do you recommend re torqueing the cyl/head studs?
  anything else I should have done while they are in there, epsecially going
  after the starter?

thanks,

To Thom Kuby and othe curious folk,

The Dean 550 Spyder was stripped of it's drivetrain and then exhibited 
at various car shows despite the protests of the Dean family. The car 
(remains) disappeared in transit sometime in 1958. I suspect that Porsche
and the Dean family had had enough.

The drivetrain is still accounted for and the pieces exist, the engine 
was in Los Angeles in another 550A Spyder asnd the transaxle in a car in 
the San Francisco area. There was an article in the Panorama about one
fan's research and finding these components.

Due to the impending 40th anniversery of James Dean's death, the press 
will no doubt publish more. 

It is true that Dean had not finished payment on the car. The estate sold
the car to settle his affairs, thus it fell into hands that tried 
to capitialize on the tragic event.

Subject: re: refinishing wheels - phone dials

Mine are getting done today, so here's some info:

Professionally, they clean 'em up, paint them a "matching" grey/silver color 
and then clearcoat them.

Robert Wood wanted $125/wheel including center caps.  For $10/more a rim,
they would polish them instead of paint.  For $25/more a rim, they would
chrome them.

I personally don't like the look of polished rims, plus when the clearcoat
fails (it will, eventually) they will look very bad very quickly.

The whole idea of chroming aluminum seems silly and bad chemistry to me.

So I decided to stick with the stock look.

Wheel Techniques (San Jose) wants $60/wheel, plus $15 mounting/removal,
plus $40 for mixing up the paint for the whole job.  If you want the
center caps detailed (black paint inlay) they send them out to a specialty
guy.  Wheel Techniques wants $35 to do this part.  That comes out to
$120/rim.  They have a 10% PCA discount.  So that's $432 for all four
rims.  They use Sikkens paint, if that matters.

The moral of the story:  wipe your brakedust off every day, wax your
rims every time you wash your car, don't use *anything* to clean them
besides car wash soap and water.  Never, ever, ever take your car through 
an automatic car wash (the tire cleaner spray is extremely nasty here).

Hope this helps!

Hi Allan,

This isn't my first complete repaint, fortunately.  I did a BMW 5-series in 
the fall, also in Delton.

I have the luxury of using a 'booth' that's an extension that I helped add 
on to my friend's garage.  LOTS of room, lighting top and sides, and best of 
all, a real Binks exhaust fan with filter system.  I also will use a fresh 
air respirator system, THIS time.
I get to use his LPHV (or is it HVLP?) guns too (Sata).  It's amazing how 
much less paint you use.  At $100/gallon, the guns pay for themselves pretty 
quick.

I usually put a balaclava on my head; covers what little hair I have left 
and my beard.  One of those disposable paint suits, too.

Think about using something other than laquer when you squirt your -6.  PPG 
and Glasurit make some pretty cool paints, and they aren't hard to work 
with.  It's nice having something you can spill brake fluid on and not have 
to worry about  it, at least for a short while.

Thanks for the comments.

Hi,

I have been asked to submit my columns on autocrossing Porsches
to the archives. Here is the fifth of nine(?) columns. Please let
me know if there are any mistakes or omissions, or other questions
that I should answer. I am editing and submitting them one at a time,
and will upload the whole thing after final editing.

There have been several requests for permission to use this material
in PCA newsletters, etc. Please ask before using it, but basically
any PCA use will be granted if the author is noted. If not too
difficult, I would like a copy of the publication with my material.

	Three-Wheeling by Mike Piera	Part 5

	Setting up a Porsche for stock class autocrossing

	"Every Porsche ever built is a race car."

	"You can't make a race car out of a pig, 
	 but you can make a very fast pig!"

So we must maximize our Porsche's autocross abilities so we will 
not be beaten by any "pigs".

Starting with the basic car condition : everything should work
properly before getting involved in the details. You should
check the engine condition with a leakdown tester, which is
much better than a simple compression guage. By forcing compressed
air into each cylinder and reading the leakage, the valves, pistons,
rings, and seals can be checked. If there is much leakage, it is
easy to determine the culprit by listening for the hissing sound
in various places. If your engine proves to be worn-out, you will
need a rebuild. Excellent luck, as you can easily balance and
bluprint the engine while it is apart! Most rules do not allow much
blueprinting, all that is needed is weight and volume matching of
components (pistons, rods, cylinder heads, etc) so that your engine
runs smoothly and evenly. Some rules allow a slight overbore with
bigger pistons, which I recommend if possible (water-cooled engines).
Note that SCCA stock rules no longer allow this type of blueprinting
other than by matching unmodified factory parts. This makes it more 
expensive to balance an engine, but it can still be done.

	Ignition components (plugs, points, wires, cap, etc) should
be in perfect condition or replace them with genuine Porsche parts.
Don't try to save a buck at K-Mart! Ignition timing should be set
as advanced as the factory spec allows. A new air cleaner should be
used, or a cleanable K & N type (be careful on the 944 series, as the
K & N has been known to leak!). On cars with catalytic converters,
much power can be lost by a clogged-up cat. If your engine runs out
of breath at high RPMs, have the exhaust back-pressure checked,
try a "power tube" cat bypass, or just crack-open the exhaust pipe
before the cat to see if it improves. New cats are very expensive
but worth the performance and economy. Valves should be adjusted
and cam timing set correctly. The fuel mixture on older cars should
be not be adjusted too rich, you want good throttle response rather
than ultimate top-end horsepower. 

	Brakes are the next important item to check. Make sure
your pads are in good condition. Factory pads are OK for autocross,
but "soft" pads like Repco and some of the new carbon pads are better.
Stay away from hard road-racing pads like Ferodo DS-11 because they
have poor performance when cold. Rubber brake lines on older cars
should be replaced with new factory rubber lines. Many aftermarket
"high performance" steel braided lines are of poor quality and even the
good ones are not much better than stock. Steel braided lines must be 
replaced often, as they seem to fail regularly. Bleed your brakes 
carefully, purging all air and old brake fluid from the system. 
A pressure bleeder such as the easy-bleed seems to be the best
choice, as the vaccuum type tends to suck. Check the balance of your
brakes by locking up the tires at 25 MPH or so with an observer.
The fronts should lock up first, but you should be able to lock up
the rears with a little more pedal effort. Check that one side is not
locking up well before the other side. Don't go overboard and flat
spot your tires!

	Suspension bushings are the next "wear" item to check. Replace
any rubber sway-bar bushings which are cracked or distorted in shape
with new factory bushings. Aftermarket plastic or nylon type bushings
will not improve handling much over new stock bushings, but will make
the suspension harsher and noisier on the street. And only stock bushings
are allowed on the rear sway bar or any suspension points in SCCA classes.
Suspension bushings on older Porsches are not easy to replace.
911 front A-arm bushings are not normally removeable and new
A-arms must be purcha$ed to replace worn out rubber bushings. The old
rubber bushings can be cut off and replaced by aftermarket hard plastic
bushings, but these are not legal in SCCA stock classes and make a car
harsh when driven on the street. 911 rear spring plate bushings 
are very important. The spring plate must be replaced to install
new factory bushings. This is expensive in both parts and labor.
"Sway-Away" adjustable rear spring plates are legal in PCA, and
make adjustments much easier. Contrary to popular belief and
advertisements, the adjustment screw does not have enough range
to change the ride height much, it is useful for corner balancing.
But the advantage to these spring plates is that only a small 
part of the spring plate needs to be removed to re-index the 
torsion bar. This can be done without disturbing the camber
and toe-in adjustments. All of these bushings mentioned can be 
replaced by the hard plastic type legally in the Porsche club PCRs.
	
	Shock absorbers are extremely important in stock class cars,
as they are one of the only improvements that are legal. A Porsche
with perfectly functioning factory sport shocks (Koni, Bilstein, etc)
can probably use the original shocks, but all others should
be replaced. Koni makes an excellent low-pressure adjustable gas shock
which comes in a "Sport" model that is stiffer than the
normal model. This shock is good for Porsches without adjustable
ride height (914 rear, 924 front, etc) because the low pressure
will not raise the car as much as the high-pressure Bilstein shocks.
The Bilstein sport shocks work well in a 911. They seem to last
longer than Konis, ride better on the road, and keep the tires
on the ground better. The lack of adjustment is not such a big
drawback, as the adjustable shocks just give you one more thing to
worry about adjusting at the autocross (although many others like
this adjustability). Definately get a good pair of sport shocks on the
rear, which is much more important than the front on a 911/914.

	Alignment is one of the other ways that your car can be
made faster than stock legally. First set the ride height to the
lowest useable setting, with the front slightly lower than the rear.
On a 911, this will be when the front and rear wheel arches are at
about the same height. The suspension should not bottom-out on its 
bump stops on a normal autocross course, or it is too low.

	NOTE : in '94, SCCA rules stated that cars in stock classes
	must compete at the stock ride height! This made even sagging stock
	springs illegal. But now any factory adjustable suspension may
	be lowered again.

	On 914s, the front can easily be lowered to give
about 1 degree of slope front to rear (the rear is probably lower
than the front due to sagging of the rear coil springs). On 911s the
front can be lowered just as easily, but the rear is a pain in the
neck (as is the rear on the 924/944). The "Up-Fixin" books from the
PCA have many articles dealing with these procedures and most others
that I mention here. Some 924s/944/928 and Carrera 2/4s with sport
suspension options have adjustable threaded spring perches which allow 
slight lowering very easily. I believe the 993 has these on the front
only. Go as low as you can on most of these cars with coil springs.

	Next, the camber, caster, and toe should be set. For best
handling, negative camber is needed. About 1.5 degrees is a good
starting point, with a little less in front. Much more may hurt
braking performance. More can be used on the rear if the car tends to
oversteer. Caster should be equal on both sides, and I like to have
more than stock (try for the maximum equal caster). The front wheels 
can be toed-out slightly (1/8") for quick steering response on initial
turn-in. The rear should be toed-in slightly (1/16") for stability, 
especially on the 911/914. These settings should be OK for limited 
street use, but be careful on the track at high speeds with toe-out.

	Now the car must be balanced. On most cars without chassis
problems or bent sway bars, there is a simple method of getting the 
car set to baseline levelness. Simply disconnect one end (or the 2
center mounts if easier) of the sway bars and place something in
the driver's seat to approximate the driver's weight. Then try to
re-attach the sway bars and you will see if one side is higher
than the other because the mounts will not line up. Adjust the
sides until the bars line up and you have a basically level car
with no swaybar pre-load. But it is possible to have more weight
on two opposite corners of the car with this method. Try jacking up
one end of the car at the center-line and see if the car comes up
straight and both wheels leave the ground at the same time. If so, you
are probably OK. If not, or if you are a serious competitor, you
should corner-balance the car. The purpose is not to get the left and
right weights equal, but the proportions equal. The left side of
the car almost always weighs more than the right. Fred Puhn's book
"how to make your car handle" has a good explanation of this
procedure, or take your car to a good shop that understands the
concept. For example, if your right side weighs 1200 and the left 
1300, with a 40/60 weight distribution front to rear (mid '70s 911)
then the right-front should weigh .40 x 1200 (480) and the left
front .4 x 1300 (520).

	Now your car should handle better than when it left Germany,
without really modifying it. Next we will look at some more
improvements to make a stock class killer car. In addition to the
PCA autocrosses, you should try to attend some other autocross events.
The PCA is now pushing autocross over track competition in Porsche
Parades, Zone events, etc. because of safety and cost. Attending
other clubs' events will give you an advantage over other PCA drivers.

Hi,

What is the best way to diagnose/fix a problem with my 911SC brakes
which bind or stick slightly after my foot releases the pedal?

They stay stuck while driving, as if my foot is on the pedal slightly.
Afterwards, the brake pedal is hard to press at the start.  Not sure 
if its the front/rear or both.  How hard is it to rebuild the calipers 
myself with the rebuild kits you can buy?  I can get rebuilt ones for
$75 and send my cores back.  Is this a simple bolt on swap?  A few hints

  One of the biggest tricks of home painting--never paint at night. Every bug
 is attracted to the lights. One morning after I finished a car (the first
 time I'd used Glasurit) I found where a bug had fallen a foot onto the hood,
 and re-enacted the trail of tears before finally falling off a fender. Roach
 prints everywhere. I told my wife that if she saw a roach limping around

	Well, that's the weight for a NEW 911.... look at the weights for an
early 911, and you'll see a much larger discrepancy the other way.  If
we're talking 911, I'll take an early "S" any day over a new C2.

Okay folks,
 
I've lived with the Florida-itas of my '74 914 for long enough!  So, as of
last evening, I've begun the task of removing the engine and tranny and
performing the major rust restoration that is required (inner rocker,
outer rocker, battery shelf, inner fender well - all passenger side). 
Therefore, I'm documenting the whole process from the perspective of a
novice to the world of vehicle reconstruction and restoration.  Step one
is the actual removal of the plant.  Drained the oil and removed the
various cable bits.  Photos all along the way.  As I progress, I'll be
putting together the evidence of my neophyte status on the 914 Fan web

I 'may' document the engine rebuild, but I've done that before, so I may 
not be as thorough with the step by step.

I've noticed the same effect, although the 911s are maybe 100-200 pounds
less. a car can be made to handle fat, however. I think my 850, also around
3400 pounds, handles fat.

In going from my 944 to 951, I think I noticed the extra couple hundred
pounds, at Mosport where I drove both cars, maybe the suspension made it
feel that way (i.e.fat). Can't wait to get that turbo cup suspension on!

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	Just got back from my 11:00 court date, took 2 HOURS just to get
to my case!  It was interesting to hear the other cases, though.  The 
judge let a 78 year old man off for running a stop sign at night (just 
couldn't see it officer :^)  then gives full sentence (20 miles over the
limit) to a young man in a BMW who was, according to the officer, "showing
off".  When my case came up the officer described the situation then I 
showed him pictures of my 914 on my uncles trailer beside the "Welcome to
Tennessee" sign on I-40.  This convinced the judge that my car would no
longer be a nuisance in Charlotte, so he let me off.
	So now The Bastard sits next to my brother's '76 914 2.0 in my
uncles barn in TN, warm and dry.  My uncle also stores in his barn a '61
MGA 1600 and a rare early '74 MGB which has chrome bumpers with rubber
pads, rather than the ugly full rubber bumpers.  My sister's '85 VW GTI
also sits there up on stands, victim of a timing belt failure (never 
replaced with 132K miles on it!  I told her to change it but sisters 
never listen :^)  It also has knocking rods, maybe because it only had
two quarts of oil in it when I checked!  ARRGH!  So now she drives the
Toy 'rolla (332K) under explicit instructions to check the oil EVERY 
WEEK while I find a replacement engine for the GTI.  
	So I guess I'll have to do without The Bastard during the week
and commute in the Green Machine (924).  I get up to Chattanooga every
other weekend or so and can run her then.  My brother and I like to go
road carving in the TN back country, each in his 914.  I love TN laws,
it's as close to anarchy in the US as you can get!  Here's to Porsche's

Subject: 928 Clutch Master Cylinder Replacement


While my clutch can still wait for another couple thousands miles
before the very end of its life, I discovered that my clutch master
is seeping fluid out when I depress it. It is just seeping at this
time, but I got the parts already to put on it.

I looked through the micro-fiche workshop manual, but it has no
coverage on this procedure. I guess this may be too trivial.
Anyway, here is what I plan on doing. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Description
	The clutch master is hiding below the brake booster. There
	are just two screw to hold it in place, which can be un-screwed
	from the cabinent. There are just two hydraulic connections to
	the master cylinder: One to the brake fluid reservoir, another
	is the line towards the clutch slave. 

Removal
1.	Use a clip to hold the fluid from the reservoir to the
	cylinder. 
2.	Disconnect the tube from reservoir to the master
3.	Unscrew the line that goes to the slave  from the master. Plug it
	with something.
4.	Unbolt the master and take it out.
5. 	Empty the brake fluid reservoir. Later replaced by new brake fluid.

Q. However, the space is kind of cramping. Any technique in reaching the
   master cylinder at ease? Do I really have to take out the brake master,
   brake reservoir, or even the booster to reach the clutch master?

Installing
1.	Connect the line from slave
2.	Connect the line from reservoir
3.	Bolt the clutch master
4. 	Fill reservoir and bleed the clutch system

Q. Is there anything I have to do with the new master before connecting?
Q. Am I over-simplifing the procedure here?

TIA,
Carlos

This is the rest of my post about 911 shocks :

Removal can be accomplished without removing the whole strut if
you are careful. Remove the brake line attachment on the inner 
fender to give more room to tilt the strut out. Remove the cap 
on the top of the shock body holding it into the strut. This is 
usually easier with the shock attached to the top strut mount. 
You may also have to remove the dust cover first.
A large monkey wrench can work, and soaking in penetrating oil
will help too. The Bilstein has a special tool for this which is
supplied with the shocks.

When loose, compress the shock and pry down on the suspension
arm (you need the sway bar disconnected for this operation).
Tilt the top of the strut CAREFULLY out of the fender opening, making
sure not to scratch the paint on the fender lip (put some tape on the
lip for extra protection). Also don't pull on the brake line too much!

Now the insert can be removed and the new
one installed. Put some oil in the strut to come close to the top
when the new insert is installed. Put the top of the shock rod 
back into the mount. Now you can tighten the insert collar with
a monkey wrench or special  tool. Then lower the shock again
to put the dust cover back on. Finally re-mount the top of
the shock and replace the washers and nut. Torque to
spec (~60 ft/lbs). Then re-bend the lock washer.

Good luck!

The '83 SC has the good late style tension arms, which don't need 
spacers or anything to use the pressure fed tensioners. They also 
work the best with the normal 930.105.053.00 type factory tensioner, 
due to improved geometry with less binding. So you don't need 
spacers either way.

The BEST update would be the carrera pressure-fed tensioners, but
as you said they are not cheap (but the price quoted seems high).
The next best is to simply replace the stock tensioners with new ones,
with the safety clamps. 

As far as a new chain, I'm not sure if it's needed. But if you use a new
chain,
you don't want to use the safety clamps until the chain has a chance to
stretch.

If you don't change the chain, you should get new chain ramps.
They are cheap and not diffucult to install.

I tried that one here last Summer in the Arizona heat.  Doesn't do much for

dust.  Unfortunately, it lets MUCH more of the desert dust INTO the

I did my own detailing of the black paint inlay -- it was really quite easy.
Just brush the black paint into the groove area and wipe off whatever smeared

Yup...I painted at night - finished up at 1:30am.  Lots of bugs!!!

To answer Doug's question about the fly on my car, it turned
into a little blob.  The air pressure and sticky paint was too
much for the little guy and he just collapsed into a blob.

Thanks for all of the supportive e-mails about this...as I
mentioned, this is a temporary paint job.  The rear fenders
are still held on by sheet metal screws and the front
fenders haven't been "smoothed" into the rest of the car
yet.  More epoxy, bondo and sanding is required.

Question #1: what type of magic tool should be used to get to the nut on

Question #2: since all of these stud/nut pairs are in horrible condition,

Can anyone confirm this?  I know it's true on the older 944s, but I was told
that the S2 has a single filter.

The current theory is that we got bad gas.  The knock sensor is very quick to
retard the timing but very slow to restore normal performance when the gas
improves.  That's probably why I thought things were getting better.  
Disconnecting the O2 sensor sent me back to the beginning as the computer
assumes the worst in that case.

Thanks to everyone who offered advice!

Sorry I did not make this clear. The insert is not a completely
tight fit in the strut. So pour a few ounces of engine oil in the
empty strut tube before inserting the insert. Then slowly
lower in the insert. You can add some oil if it does not seem to
come up towards the top. 

If you are replacing the original shock, it is probably full 
of oil when you remove the "guts". Then you have to remove 
lots of oil or it will pour out when you lower in the insert.
(The original shock is not a sealed insert, but a valved thing
that uses the strut as part of the shock).

This bit of oil oil helps in heat transfer, and to keep the
insert in place.

Sorry to hear about your motorcycle accident, I've still got a metal plate and six screws in my left leg to

just waiting for you...

Thursday evening I got my 88 911 Cab and I love it!!!  I also find the ingition switch on the left a little 
disconcerting.  I also noticed, when backing out of my fairly steep driveway, that if you stall it <cringe> you 
have to rotate the key all the way off before it will engage the starter again.  There does seem to be a 
"knockout" on the right side of the steering wheel, might be able to relocate the key, anyone know or done it? 
 The pedals don't bother me as my first car was a VW back in the early 70's (oops dating myself and not as 
lucky as Adam who has a Porsche at 16!).

I messed up my back again yesterday attempting to play golf, for the first time in years, at a company outing 
and I can tell you that the drive back from the club this morning was very uncomfortable but the car and the 
open top does provide some dose of "medication". 

I had my share of accidents back in the 70's...
AH Sprite totaled when a guy ran a stop sign in a snow storm.

Monte Carlo totaled when a drunk thought a road we were on was actually an entrance ramp to a highway 
and hit me head on.

Lotus Elan S2 totaled when the vaccum operated headlight took a dump rounding a series ofvery sharp curves 
at speed in the middle of no where.

Then the motorcycle...

Narrowly missed a minor one on the way to the resort yesterday morning, thru no fault of my own... the jerk 
tailgating me changed lanes and, when someone ahead rearended some other unluckly soul, I stopped easily, as 
did a non-tailgater behind me.  He was not so lucky as he was hit as well, as were a couple of cars behind 
him...  Since I relocated to Florida I have seen more rearend accidents than anywhere else I have ever lived!!!

I've only had this car a couple of days and it seems that everyone either wants to cut you off, race you or 
tailgate you.  Porsche's MUST be an accident magnet!

Anyway enough rambling.  Kevin, hope your surgery goes GREAT and you get driving that Porsche 
SOON!!!

 Greetings,
 
 L-Jet mileage:
 --------------
 My '74 1.8L with L-Jet (that's a bit redundant, huh) drove me to Colorado a few 
 years back.  Loaded with luggage for a 6-week trip, about four different Air 
 Force uniform combinations, with a mountain bike strapped to the back decklid 
 and blazing through CA, AZ, NM and CO at around 75-85 MPH where possible, it 
 averaged...
 
 33 MPG.  Oh, and the windows were open!
 
 I don't think I ever got 25 MPH, 'cept perhaps when I first got it and 
 introduced myself to world-class handling and trabant-class acceleration (sort 
 of requires having one foot on the floor at all times: either on the right 
 pedal (thinking that pushing really hard might give some sort of Flintstone 
 acceleration boost) or on the middle one (wishing you could augment with a 
 Flintstone braking system).)
 
 
 911 wheels, brakes and rotors on 914:
 ------------------------------------
 One of the junker 914's I bought has, besides the chrome bumpers and fog lights 
 I got it for, a set of oxidized Fuchs 5-spokes and what I can assume to be 911 
 rotors (radial venting and cross drilling).  I might want to swap this over the 
 the (soon to be) running car.  Is there a correct way to convert?  I don't want 
 to slap this stuff on if the PO used all the half-assed parts, etc.  Particular 
 questions: Are the rear wheel bearings the same? Are caliper spacers OK?  Will 
 offset remain similar?  Perhaps dumb questions, but if someone out there has 
 gone through the process I would appreciate any assistance (I would go look at 
 the car, but it is stored a ways away from me....)
 
 
 Random 914 stuff: 
 ----------------
 -I scraped off about two coke cans full of oil and dirt from the engine case 
 yesterday.  I guess a steady oil leak, a dusty, desert climate and a PO who is 
 too cheap to replace seals is not a good combination
 
 -I checked the Wilson book.  Indeed, book says to install engine first, then 
 transaxle.  I think most here would disagree.... 
 
 -According to responses: I will use the Viton pushrod tube seals, wet with 
 motor oil (of course the way the engine rebuild is going, that will be a ways 
 away.... :-(

Welcome!  I've had my 993 for 1 year and have enjoyed it until about the 10k
mark.  Braking was OK and then I began having fade when braking at speed ie
1-110 down.  pedal became very mushy and decided to bleed brakes.  I obtained
a huge amount of air out of the rear calipers and the bleed nuts were still
sealed with paint.  That tells me that they were never bled right at the
factory if at all.  Needless to say I'm p*ssed.  Porsche has some explaining
to do

Shrikumar -
You can buy a 924 relatively cheap, but proper maintenance and repairs aren't
significantly cheaper than a 944. Best buy on a muffler is from PAR Porsche
in NY, about $150. Check the ads in Panorama or Excellence.

IMHO - Take the extra $1500-$2000 you'll spend to make the 924 right and buy
an 86 944 - you'll like the extra HP, 4 wheel disc brakes, etc.

Make sure that you include a water pump lubricant in whatever mix you

(the powder vs. the liquid form, I think).

Hi Hans-Petter,

Let me answer what I can of your questions.

2. DME adaptation.  I have never seen an official statement of what the
ML.3 DME adapts.  But I have been told that there are two basic kinds
of learning it does:

  1. It will retard the spark timing of individual cylinders to eliminate
     knock.

  2. It will ignore sensors whose signal values are obviously out of
     range (eg, a resistive sensor which is zero or infinite impedence).

6. Rainwater at the bottom of the luggage compartments.  This will happen
if you are missing the rubber one-way valves which insert into the drain
holes.  They do tend to fall out.  The part number for the left and right
"cubby" valves is 111.801.177.  That for the spare wheel well is 111.701.309.

You can also get rainwater in the cubbies if the sunroof drain hoses are
not right.  In particular, there is a T-fitting hidden under the right-side
carpeting.  Make sure it's hooked up.

It is very common for the rear lenses to take in rainwater if not resealed
properly after removal and replacement.  There is a seal kit for them,
from VW is fact, but I do not have the part number handy.  I can dig it
out if you need it.  Typically, the lenses will fill with water, more so
than letting water into the cubbies.

It is *not* normal for water to enter the car.  I drive mine twelve months
a year, and it is perfectly dry on the inside at all times.

9. Someone else posted the part number...

10. In the US, the '87 944S was designated with "model order code"
944 342.  It has no meaning other than something for the salesman to 
write on the order form.  I do not know what the other option codes
mean in your list.

Subject: Continuing 944 thread



Thanx again to all who have contributed to this thread.  One can learn an 
enormous amount of information about Porsches in a comparatively short 
time via this list!

And now to quit pissing about 944 hotrod prospects....  Despite my 
inquiries about more HP, I can't say that the car is unpleasant to drive, 
nor can I say that its performance is bad.

There are a lot of neat things about the car.  It's difficult to put into 
words some of the things that I like about it - the styling?   Compared 
to other kinds of cars, there's some really cool styling in there, but 
there are NO gimmicks.  What's a gimmick?  I bunch of wild decals, gaudy 
tape-stripes, wild paint jobs, and tacked-on spoilers to give an ordinary 
car an illusion of being a performer.  There is a spoiler on the back of 
my 944 (all 944's?), but it fits in nicely with the lines of the car.

Subtlety?  Perhaps that's what I can describe it by.  When I get in the 
car and look at the dashboard, it seems so "German" and the gauges are 
the coolest assortment of any car I've owned - no gimmicks (like the LCD 
dash of my former Corvette - a $1000 maintenance nightmare if anything 
goes out) - no sharp angles in an attempt to "be cool" - just subtle 
signs of quality.  [note: I looked in an older 944 and I didn't like it 
as much as the newer ones - no offense].

Interesting is the reactions that even my "low end" 944 receives from 
observers.  [It's mint condition, black, all polished&waxed]  It gets 
more recognition than my big loud punch-packing Corvette did.  My mom is 
a good example.  She isn't really concerned with cars at all and doesn't 
pay much attention.  She could hardly tell my Corvette from a Camaro I 
used to have.  However, upon seeing my 944, she asked me "Where did you get 
that fancy car?"  She knew it was a Porsche immediately!  My boss's young 
son was absolutley MAD about the car, and I had to let him drive.  After 
we went for a short trip (he didn't even make the tach swing very far), 
it was obviously an important experience for him...heh heh heh.  The 
verdict: PEOPLE GO MAD OVER PORSCHES!!!....even my meager 944!!

I can see why Porsche drivers are some of the most "loyal to their brand" 
of any make.  Before I got this Porsche, I never seemed to pay much 
attention to Porsches - I did notice/lust for ones that were right under 
my nose, but now I find myself looking for Porsches (even unconsciously) 
when I'm on the road.  Even when I'm not looking, my subconscious picks 
them out.  Now I'm at the point where I wish I could guess what year car 
I'm looking at - but have insufficient information.  I can't even tell 
what year another 944 is!

I'm also interested in the history of Porsches - all of them.  How did 
the 944 come to me?  What is the relation between the 944 and the 924?  I 
am nuts about both the 928 and the 911.  From my casual observations, the 
911 becomes better-looking and faster with each year.  The 928?  There's 
a very interesting car - I love the back end - first saw one in the movie 
"Risky Business (Tom Cruise) years ago.  Am I correct in my assumption 
that every 928 hauls ass?  Don't they all have V-8s?  When did this car 
debut?  I'll bet it was waaaaaay ahead of its time when it did.

Rambling mode off....I did get the FAQ but want more information.   Is 
there any book that charts the changes and gives history of the Porsche cars?

Subject: Re: 912E as a first time

     Well here is my experience with a 912E -- it was an  association that 
     lasted 16 yrs!!!  I purchased the vehicle in 1979, it had:  A/C, SR, 
     El. windows, leatherette interior, 15" rims/tires, thermos removed, 
     etc.
     
     I had to have the engine redone twice in 60K miles -- first time 
     because a gallery plug between the two engine halves fall out -- 
     caught in time, but engine had to come out and be fully dismantled.  
     So -  we did it right, and did a full re-build - pistons, jugs, 
     camshaft, clutch,  etc..
     
     Three or four years later, the crankshaft end-seal (?) blew, and oil 
     spilled all over -- again caught in time (just as I pulling into a 
     gas station) but again total take apart.  This time crankshaft 
     regrind,  again new jugs and pistons, bearings, etc.
     
     I appears that most of the problem was due to the HEAT from the A/C 
     heat exchanger -- mounted in the engine air intake, which just 
     preheats the air, and overheats the oil, etc.  On hot days with A/C 
     on the temp gauge would get close to red!
     
     Installed an oil cooler with electric fan in rear fender.  
     Temperatures OK from then on.  I also installed full 911 gauges, 
     Cruise control, Sanyo AC compressor, etc.  Car was "pristine". Note I 
     did all this by myself, thus costs were nominal. I did a number of 
     valve adjustments -- it appears that every 3-5K miles they have to be 
     adjusted - the good about this is that I could do in 1 ~ hour.
     
     Just sold the car -- I paid $10K when I purchased it, and sold it for 
     $12K - not bad as to price, but not good given 2 rebuilds.
     
     I had fun with the car -- but now I have a 91 C-2 -  wow!!! what a 
     difference.  
     
     If I had known then what I know now, I would have never purchased 
     the 912E!!!
     
     So, if you like driving, handling and sophistication, buy a 911.
     
     If you want to be able to maintain the car yourself, save on 
     insurance, oil costs, low yearly license fees, buy the 912E!
     
     It is a good compromise, but it is a compromise -- you have one life 
     to live -- enjoy it!

I am the guy having the brake sticking problem.  

I bleeded my brakes last night and noticed that when the bleed
valve on a caliper was open, and I pumped the brake pedal down to 
eject fluid from the valve into a one-man-bleeder tube that
I bought, the pedal did NOT spring back up.  It wold stay
depressed at the floor.  Note that this was with the bleeder
valve open.  Is this normal?  Could my spring be bad on the 
pedal (as someone suggested).

Note that after bleeding, the brakes still stuck on the way to 
work today.  I used DOT 4 fluid I bought new from a car parts 
store, is this correct?

Before you blame the factory for not bleeding your brakes, which I doubt,
remember that air can get into a closed system by other means.
Perhaps the fluid has been contaminated with moisture, giving it a lower
boiling point. In that case spirited driving could cause boiling of the fluid
in the caliper and the resultant air and soft pedal. 
Have you done any AutoX or track events? If you did you easily could have
boiled the fluid even if it was fresh. Repeated high speed stops would do the
trick.
Replace your fluid and bleed the system carefully. ABS presents no problem
when bleeding. If your problem persists then get worried.
Good Luck

Subject: 83 944  DME box failure 


The recent mention of an intermittant failure mode on a 951 DME
unit comes at an interesting time.

Some pphiles may remember the intermittant '944 dies' problem 
that I have been having , on and off, for nearly a year now.

Every time I tried to trace the problem, the car would spring back to
life.

I systematicaly went through the entire engine management system, checking
components, cleaning up relays and contacts, checking the wiring, and so on
without a great deal of success.

What I ended up doing was repositioning the DME control box so that easy
access could be gained to the back of the wiring connecter. I then measured
all the voltages under various 'normal' conditions. ie cold engine/ hot engine,
ignition on but engine not running, idle, etc. etc. , then I just waited
for the little darling to go wrong again. And waited, and waited ..

Last weekend it eventualy failed, and I was able to detect the following.

Pin 13 (engine temp sensor) normaly reads 5.00 volts with sensor disconnected.
It reads 0.99 - 1.2 volts with sensor connected and engine warm.

When the car died, it read 0.01 volts . All other readings were OK., and
pin 13 - ground was correct at 260 Ohms.

Conclusion ? The DME box is busted .

Does anyone have, or know where to obtain , circuit diagrams for this little
beast .  Unfortunately I can't even trace this line on the PCB , as it's 
hidden by the part of the casing that acts as the heat sink. To remove the
board completely I need to unsolder the power trannies, and the multi-pin
connector. I am reluctant to do this .
What I would like to do is be able to trace back through the circuit to find 
(I think) a pcb crack, or dry solder joint.

Failing that, what is the general concensus on trying to pick up a used DME
box ?? Availability ?? How often do they go wrong ?? 

All help/advice welcomed.

FYI, I had all the belts on my car replaced a year ago at the

myself and cost less than $10.  Btw, the plug wires cost close
to $200 from a dealer, but you can pick them up for under $100
from a couple of the aftermarket places.  Are you sure they weren't

Hope this gives you some useful info for pricing.  What bearings are

Subject: Allstate 911 flood payoff

Thank you all for your good wishes re: the recent loss of my 1986 Carrera in
"the flood" of New Orleans. As so many of you were interested in how much
they were going to give me for the car, I am writing with good news.

After taking receipts for renovations, rebuilds and accessories and a recent
3rd place in a Concours into consideration, they came very close to "high
blue book". I lost some for the 120K on the odometer, but received credit for
the Fuchs, spoilers, sunroof, leather, and the aforementioned work and award.
Basically I got in excess of $25K less $500 deductible {and the banks
portion].

I did inquire re: salvage, but this would greatly delay payment due to
cumbersome payment, transport and storage fees. That, combined with
sentimental reasons, eliminated this option for me.

For those interested, the car is now the property of Allstate and at the
Greater New Orleans Auto Auction in Slidell, LA. It has a blue interior for
those wishing to restore theirs. Most of the vinyl made it thru OK. For
information on bidding for the car, call the auction at 800-783-2062.

I am waiting to purchase another 911 until I am established in California. I
will be moving out there within the next 12-18 months. If anyone knows of
open positions in the preventative health and/or computer sector, please
e-mail me. CA is my home, and I will accept any decent offer in order to get

the first time, and that 4th-5th gears were not working.  We
got underneath the car last night and tried shifting/moving
the shift linkage through the shift fork opening.  

We can sucessfully move the trans into r,1,2,3, and into 5 but
it pops out when we rotate the tire.  4 is impossible, the
linkage inside the transmission will not move past nuetral.

What could be blocking the 4-5 gear set from completely engaging
5th gear and totally not moving towards the 4th gear?  Visual inpsection
shows no wear on the gears and synchros look fine - given the limited
view.  BTW, we did get the shift fork/linkages correct when we
had everything installed.

Also, is there any reason to believe that pulling the car off the
jack stands and starting/driving it would produce different results?
Is there something that rotates/moves differently when being spun
by the engine that we cant reproduce on jackstands and rotating
the tire by hand?  Synchros?

We've decided that its *not* the shifter (or its rear tunnel linkage
connection) since we cant shift the 4-5 gears from underneath the
car with the shift fork out (using a screwdriver carefully).
And, we can shift all the other gears sucessfully from underneath.

Any help would be appreciated, or its rebuild the trans time....

Thanks (and very bummed out),

Ron D.

Hiall,

Yesterday it happened, my newly aquired '65 911 showed up at the first
stop on it's way 'home' to Europe. It will leave next Monday, and I
will have it in time for my Holiday.

The car will taste our splendid mountain roads this summer.....

I got some requests from people about which company to use for
shipping, and in my case it turned out that DEAN worldwide, through
CROWN Pacific is a very good choice.

Shipping from CA to Gothenburg, Sweden sums up to $900-1050 depending
on how lucky you get (e.g. last car in a 40 footer?).

I expect to pay $300 for hauling etc in Gothenburg, and all in all
$1200 plus insurance must be considered to be a good price.

cheers,
Trond V.

Subject: 022 Distrib. rebuild - HELP!

I am rebuilding an 022 distributor using the Shim kit, new springs, Insulator 
kit and new teflon piece from Stoddard.  I pressed the pin that holds the drive 
gear out successfully and now have a couple of questions.

1)  The springs attach to this plate that is slotted and is held down by two 
screws.  The two screws are only accessible if I remove the drive gear and pull 
out the shaft.  These slots allow you to change the position so that the weights 
can move without actually hitting the springs and also exert more or less 
tension on the weights.  My distributor had the plate tightened down so that the 
screws were at the extreme end of the slots and the spring tension was at it's 
greatest.  How do I determine what position to tighten this plate down?   If 
this effects the advance (which I think it must), is the only way to check it   
to attach the drive gear, press in the pin and install it in my 912?  If it is 
wrong then do I have to press out the pin again and start all over?

2)  Does the Stoddard shim kit designed to fit several distributors?  I have one 
shim size in my kit that doesn't fit anywhere in my 022.  I also have 2 
different types of retaining clips that don't don't fit my 022.

3)  How much movement should the drive shaft be allowed to have at room 
temperature?  When I say movement I mean if you pull back and forth on the  
drive shaft, the shaft will go up and down.  I can easily put enough shims in to 
allow no movement at all, but I would imagine some room is needed for thermal 
expansion.  How much?

Thanx in advance!

The consensus on 16 valve heads is: stay away. The 1979 Lemans 924 turbo
had 16 valve heads, but the 968 RS turbo has a two valve head. Of course
Andial claims to have two customer cars with 2.8 l 4-valvers running, so

You do not have to have, but it is highly recommended that for the

Is it a whistle or a whining?

When I first got my 87 944S, it had a rattling sound when the engine
was cold.  Turned out to be the balance belt was so loose, it was
rubbing against the belt housing.  So I tightened it a little to
stop it from flopping.  From that point on, I had this irritating
whine (worse when car is cold). A few weeks later I replaced the
timing and balance belts and all the rollers. Even had the balance
belt tensioned properly with the tension gauge. Still had the whine.
I've heard this is normal with some 944s.  So I hope you arent going
to spend $1000 on a whine that you may not be able to get rid of.
By the way, my timing/balance belt and rollers I got from Zims for
$200 and the mechanic charged $25 for balance belt tensioning.
I'd get a second opinion on those prices.

Oh, I have 131K on my car.

Actually it did start with a really bad whistling.  At first I thought it 
was cute, for the first minute because it sounded like a remote control 
car.   But I had it looked at and it turned out to be that the timing 
belt was on the verge of falling off within the next hundred mile and 
that the rollers weren't doing their job.  In fact, one wouldn't even 
turn!  So all that needed to be replaced and so did the fuel filter since 
it was still the original!  Obviously the previous owner didn't care to 
maintain such a nice care as this.  The total service maintainance costed 
almost $1000 and I still have to replace the engine mounts since the 
right side is blown to high hell which causes the care to vibrate quite 
violently when I accelerate and sit at idle.

        The /6 front rotors were also vented.  Beware of the cross-drilled
stuff, though.  Unless it was cast that way (i.e., not really "drilled"),
the holes make for really dandy stress risers which can lead to cracking.
Which is not a good thing.  If you put these on as is, be sure to check
them very frequently.  I don't know if once a week is too much or too lit-
tle, but we're talking about a possible catastrophic failure of your brakes.

        I would.  If you can buy/borrow/fake up the special VW support tool,
put 'em together first and then stuff the whole assembly in.  You'd have to

Yep, it's a reality (at least conceptually)...

What's up you say?  Well, after missing that last opportunity to get a
glimpse of the Boxster when I let hesitation stand in the way of
unbridled spontaneity, I didn't let a nanosecond pass before saying "yes!"
when a local marketing research firm called asking whether or not an hour
of my time was worth $100 and did I in fact own a Porsche.

The whole interview was was rather fast and furious with computer screens,
spec sheets, photos, and conceptual drawings coming at me at a mile a
minute. The basic minivan looked like a Camry Station wagon/Taurus wagon 
hybrid.  The platform appeared to be closer to the Camry in size, with the 
roofline raised to accommodate six bucket seats (2x2x2).  There was a 
Taurus wagon-like integral roof rack also.  I was presented with 3 front 
cowl, side, and rear configurations all of which were none too spectacular, 
and without the Porsche badge on the hood and C2 turbo wheels I would have 
never quessed the vehicle had originated from the Porsche concept shop.

The specs I saw were as follows.  V6, biturbo, 2.9 liter, 248hp.  All 
wheel drive, 17 inch wheels, "Porsche braking system", 5 speed manual or
4 speed triptronic. Engine was obviously upfront, but none of the
concept drawings showed what was under the hood.  Cost was $53,960 US.

I was also shown some interior concepts representing sport, family, and
business options.  Some of the acoutrements looked rather Jetsonque.
Options included integral FAX/PC/phone hook-ups, onboard refrigerator,
digital stereo, video screens, refrigerated glovebox (The 928 lives on!),
a trash can ($20 <g>), heated seats, traction control, side impact
air bags, equipment racks, super-duper sun roof, and on and on.  A
pseudo ad for the business package I was shown stated the vehicle was 
"The Lear Jet of minivans!".

And I'm not kidding about the name - Vanerra.  Alternatives included
the Maxster, the Magster, and the Verrara.  Hey, take your pick, vote
now.

A  portion of the interview was dedicated to comparing the Porsche
concept to a Chrysler Town and Country and the Volkswagen Sharan and
Sharan RS.  From a cost and performance standpoint they were 
obviously in different leagues, but I'm sure they had their reasons.

Just to reiterate, everything I saw on the Porsche minivan were
drawings, nothing in metal, clay, or plastic. So, I don't think
this baby will be rolling stock for quite a while, if in fact
Porsche chooses to pursue it any further.

Subject: 944 History, very long (maybe boring)

Hi James,

In a message dated 95-06-07 01:21:28 EDT, you write:

>I'm also interested in the history of Porsches - all of them.  How
>did the 944 come to me?  What is the relation between the 944 
>and the 924?  I am nuts about both the 928 and the 911.  From 
>my casual observations,...

Here is a brief history of the 944:

The 944 was first sold in 1983. Actually, the Porsche factory raced a car
called the 924 GTS Carerra (or something like that) in the 1981 or 1982
LeMans race my books are at home). This was a 924 Turbo, with special body
work, that looked VERY similar to what became the 944  In 1983, Porsche
discontinued the 924, and started selling the 944. 

The 944, although based on the 924, was a much better car. It has a real
Porsche engine, with 143 HP (as oppossed to the Audi 924 engine), 4 wheel
disc brakes, and a Porsche suspension. It was an immediate sales success.

Midway through the 1985 year, the car was extensively changed. The dashboard
was redesigned, the steering wheel was raised for more leg clearance, and the
suspension was improved. The car would basically stay the same until the 968
replaced it in 1992. 

In 1986 Porsche introduced the 944 Turbo. The design goals were a 50%
increase in HP and Torque, and no decrease in MPG. The HP went from 147 to
217, and fuel economy dropped by 1 mpg. The suspension and brakes were
upgraded to handle the addition power. I believe that 1986 was the best sales
year for the 944 line. Here are the sales figures: 944 10,901, Turbo 7,513

In 1987 two new Porsches appeared. For increased performance without a
turbocharger, there was the 944S, which went from an 8 valve to a 16 valve
head. For a less expensive car, Porsche reintroduced the 924S, which used the
older 924 body and suspension, with the 944 powertrain. The 944S has 188 HP.
The 924S was actually faster than the 944, because it was lighter, and more
aerodynamic. In 1987, ABS brakes and airbags were available.  

1988 was the banner year for the 944. There was a 924S (924 body, 944
powertrain), regular 944 (8v engine, 158HP), 944S (16v, 188HP), 944 Turbo
(8v, 217HP), 944 Turbo S (8v, 250HP). The 944 Turbo S was the fifth faster
production car in the world, behind 2 Ferrari's, 1 Lamborghini, and the
928S4. It has a top track speed of 162! It also was the best handline Porsche
in 1988, being quicker in slamons and on the track than the 911 Club Sport.
Even though there were all these 944 models, sales continued to drop. This
was probably due to the continuing price increases. The 944 Turbo S model
cost more than $50,000!

In 1989 the model line was changed again. There were now three models. The
regular 944, which tried to improve performance by increasing the engine
displacement  from 2.5l to 2.7l. HP went from something like 158 to 165. The
944 S was changed into the 944 S2 by increasing the engine size from 2.5 to
3.0l, HP went to 208HP, and 944 Turbo (same as 88 Turbo S, 250HP). 

In 1990 and 91 the only 944 sold in the US was the S2, which was produced in
coupe and cabriolet version. 

1992 saw the 968 being sold. The was bascially the same as the 944, with the
front body work being different. The headlights retract like a 928.. The
engine is the same 3.0l as the 944 S2, with the addition of variable valve
timing. This increased HP from 208 to 236. It looks like 1995 is going to be
the last year for the 968, as the 986 or Boxter is due to appear.

Some other interesting notes:

Porsche created a special suspension package for club racing called the M030
option. This included stiffer sway bars, stiffer springs, adjustable shocks,
and a Limited Slip Transaxle. This was standard on the 1988 Turbo S and the
89 Turbo. 

The ultimate 944 performance cars are the 88 TurboS (400 -1000 sold in US)
and the 89 Turbo (700 -1000 sold in US). These cars are really set up for the
race track. They have adjustable shock absorbers, special brake ducts to cool
the brakes, oversized brakes from the 928S4, transaxle coolers, etc. These
cars are
selling for $15 - 20 K depending on condition.

The real bargain car is the 85.5 944. Most people think they are 85's, but
they really are 86's, with all of the benefits. You can find these cars in
good condition for around $7000.

The first Porsche with available ABS brakes and airbags was the 944. This
happened in 87, a few years before they were available in the 911. If you did
order the airbags, you had to order them for both the driver and the
passenger..  

If you have any more questions on 944's, just ask.

Subject: Shrikumar and his 924 vs.944

Hello Shrikumar and Phello Porschephiliacs,
	Regarding Shrikumar's prospective '82 924 and Paul's suggestion 
that his money would be better spent on an '86 944 I have a few opinions.
For one, I've never seen an '86 944 for $2-3,000 more than Shrikumar's
924, whose owner is asking in the 2K range.  Even '85.5-'87 944s I've
driven in the $7-9000 range are trashed and in need of AT LEAST as many 
repairs as Shrikumar's '82 924.  Also, parts for the 924 ARE significantly
less expensive than 944s.  Where can you find a 944 muffler for $150?  A
friend of mine on p-philes has compiled a list of 924 parts that are
interchangeable with variable VW's and Audis.  These parts can be found at
NAPA whereas the almost all-Porsche 944 parts must come from one of the
communist Porsche part suppliers.  
	I have freinds with 944's that report up to TWICE the yearly
repair bills of my 924, which last year only needed $228 in repairs.  My
average yearly repair bill for the past five years is $296.53, though I
do small repairs myself (a must with any Porsche).
	Paul does suggest a great place to buy specialized parts such as
the $150 muffler.  PAR in Yonkers NY can be reached at (914) 476-6700, 
but have no 800 number that I know of.  The only thing that bothers me
about his particular 924 is the broken odometer, which can be repaired
(about $100) but never made "correct".  Shrickumar, the best way to make
a deal on a car that needs a few repairs is to find out how much the 
repairs are going to cost, show them to the owner, and ask that this 
amount be taken off the price.  I still think that around $2000 is a 
good deal on an '82 924, which is a fairly rare car.  Write back and tell
me (or us :^)  about the condition of the car and what other repairs it
needs.  Hope this helps!

my bulb has not burned out but is really too dim to

a slightly higher wattage bulb.

does anyone a part number, my manual lists most of

if they've raised the wattage since 1978?  i hope so!

any suggestions would be most appreciated,

Subject: Broken 944 three-spoke steering wheels


Chester,

This is more common than you think. I have broken two three-spoke 
steering wheels (two different cars) while autocrossing. The welds 
actually fail. This is due to the high level of effort required to 
turn sticky tires with no power assist.

When you replace the wheel, I will highly recommend the 4-spoke sport
steering wheel. It is slightly smaller in diameter and a little easier 
to grip. Perhaps George Bueselinck can help you georgeb@mhv.net. 

You will need a 24mm socket to remove the remains of your wheel. A
15/16" inch socket is close in a pinch. Set the wheels straight prior 
removing the steering wheel. Make sure your new wheel has all of the 
pads, springs and horn contact with it. I paid around $150 for a good 
4-spoke steering wheel.

I realized when I wrote my initial note that I was being misleadind.  Ooops.  
The rotors in question have axial venting that I believe is cast in (nice little
chamfers at the edge, stuff like that.)  They look just like the came that way 
from the factory.  Can anyone tell me which year/model 911s had radial and axial
venting cast in from the factory? (if any?)

Yeah -- I am a fan of the single unit install (tranny and engine) although I 
must say that the third "single unit" I removed came out MUCH easier when I 
removed the injectors and rails.  Those things always seem to catch on the body 
where the outboard ends of the engine-mount bar bolts up.  I don't know if I 
will install sans fuel injectors though -- I seem to remember having a hard time
connecting those 2" pieces of fuel hose from the rail to the injectors.


MINIMAL P-PHILE CONTENT:

Does anyone have a Blue Book, Used Car buyers guide, or similar such book handy?
I am thinking of buying (don't laugh ta me yet) a used '93 Honda Civic SI (125 
hp 1.6l engine, air, in dash CD).  The guy selling it wants someone to take over
payments when he moves to Israel.  The remainder of the load will be $5600.  I'm
thinking that I could buy the car, drive it for a few months, detail it and see 
if I can sell it for more (thus allowing me to spend more $$$ on the 914!).  
Anyway, if someone can give me an estimate of worth, I's appreciate it!

I faced the same question with my '72 911 distributor, and I adjusted 
it so that at rest, i.e., with the weights snugged in, the springs were 
neither loose nor under tension, but just ready to stretch as centriptal 
force cause the weights to swing outwards.  Works fine.

There are special tools, like a Sun analyzer, that allow you to check 
advance curves with the distributor out of the engine.  You can take it 
to a shop that has one.  You can also put it in the engine and try it.  


>How much movement should the drive shaft be allowed to have at

Had the same question, but in the end I figured it wasn't a real 
important issue.  There really isn't any load to speak of on the 
distributor drive gear.  It sort of just rests lightly on the intermediate 
shaft gear.  I just shimmed it so there was some play, but not much.  
Maybe .003" or .004"

Actually, there is an easier way.  If you use two floor jacks.  
Put one in from the side of the car and the other from the tail.
Roll the engine/trany on one of those moving dollies (these are
great and reasonably priced.  Or, just put casters on a square board).
Reach under the engine cross bar in the front with the jack moved in
from the side, and under the tail of the tranny with the jack moved in
from the tail of the car.  Now, either with a helper slowly jack up
the drive train and align it (be careful of FI and electricals on the
way up!)  Or, jack a few inches on one, then move to the next and
repeat until you've got the assembly up all the way.  Very doable.
I've done the job both ways.

I know a guy in Baltimore who has for a sale a European spec '78 
911SC.  I've driven it and it is a very tight, well maintained car.  
Not concourse by far, but in very good condition. 
  
The car was in Florida most of the time and the owner has had it for 
about 15 years.

The specifics:

1978 911SC European model with original ducktail -nice thing is that 
the whole back opens up to the rear seats like a hatch back.

85K mi  (gauges are in km though)

Bright yellow w/black vinyl interior, in very good condition -not 
mint.

Has been repainted in some areas (original color) and has been in a 
minor accident but everything has been restored with metal etc.

The guy is a manager at Merchant's tire and auto but has always taken 
the car to dealers, porsche mechanics etc. 

All receipts including the ones after the accident and one for a major 
valve and clutch job.  

I did see some oil seeping at the bottom but there are no oil spots 
in the garage.

BBS wheels

New Pirelli P700's

Asking $13,900.  Car does need new heater boxes and will need new mph 
speedo to pass MD inspection.  The cost of these items will be 
deducted from the asking price. Other than that the price is firm.  If 
interested call me or send me an e- mail.  

If interested  I can take pictures of it and put it out on my web 
site.

 - Body is near perfect, straight and true, NO RUST, never crashed or
damaged, and newly repainted with semi- rear flares.
 - Wheels are almost perfect 16 " - and with new Goodrich R1 track tires
 -205x55 front and 225x50 rear.
 - Inside has race seat, with 2 five point harness, race steering wheel and

I recently bought a factory cover for my C2 and after using it 2 times
returned it. It seemed a bit cheap to me, a lightweight, thin material,
that was kinda rough to the touch with a silver, spaceman coating that
looked like it would eventually flake off. I then did a little research and
found that the Evolution 3/4 fabrics, although good at repelling the sun
and water, are quite bulky. One would probably fill the entire trunk of my
911. And the Evolution fabric is only moderatly durable. THere's a new
fabric called Tyvek that is kinda like paper surgical booties and hats. No
thanks. Finally, there's Ultralon, a mid to lightweight fabric with a 
slight stretchy quality, provides excellent sun protection and water
repellancy and is quite durable. This is what I decided upon and so far I'm
well pleased. Can't attest to the water repellancy yet, but I like the
weight and the sun protection (South Florida sun is brutal).

I also recommend buying from AutoXtra in Santa Monica. Their prices
were the best (~$130) I found and they are very helpful.  They also have great
prices on Lloyds floormats (got a set from them a few weeks ago $99)

I just received one in Kimbery Clark Evolution 4 from APA industries (COvercraft Brank).

As far as sun protection - it sure looks like it protects as it is opaque.

They are available in Blue, Tan, Grey.

$99.00 for custom fitted.  I havn't tried it on though because the car
is being paineted at the moment.  See page 127 - May pano.  Delivered
in 7 days though they said 2 weeks, so they are good in  my book!

Subject: My 1st 914 experience



All of this rambling, and the mentioning of "snobbery" against a 914 
being a "real" Porsche leads me to ramble about the 1st and only race I'd 
had against a 914.

This was during my high-school days, in 1986.  I was in a then-new '86 
Camaro with a 5-liter and 5-speed. (pathetic carbureted pile)  In my 
youthful ignorance, I thought I was driving a fast car.  One day while 
crusing up and down "the strip" in Anchorage (AK), I encountered a couple 
of hippies (no offense, anyone) in a bananna yellow 914.  The car was 
very ordinary, and it looked like it had VW Beetle wheels on it.  I'd 
been into VW Bugs back then - didn't know anything about Type 4s, but I 
didn't figure 914s were much of a car.

These dudes were certifiably, undeniably inebriated.  The passenger 
nonchalantly toked on a pot pipe, while in between swigs of his 
40-ouncer, the driver challenged me to a race, in slurred speech.  I 
thought he was joking and I laughed.  It took some serious facial 
expressions on his part to convince me that he was indeed serious.

We faced off at a stoplight (popular spot) where a city road becomes 
freeway - that way you get to drag and go for top speed in a single 
race.  I revved that sluggish 305 until the pushrods would have liked to 
bent and slipped the clutch a little off the line to avoid wheelspin 
(what little that wheezy powerplant could muster) and we were off!  We 
were only even to the top of 1st gear - when I hit second, I knew I'd 
lost.  Everytime he let off to shift, his 914 would backfire and spit 
flame - which only dramatized his victory.

However, prior to the race, I made sure and told him that this was a 
top-end race too, and we'd race to the next town if we had to.  I figured 
there might be a possibility he has a light car with a modified engine 
and 4.56's in the transaxle.  Well, when I hit 120MPH (which took time), 
his taillights were only getting smaller.  I don't think they Chev had 
much more in her.  I maintained speed for another little while, thinking 
how fun it would be to catch up - but I never did.  I let off and took an 
exit, fearful of speedtraps.  I took a parting glance down the highway 
and those little 914 taillights looked awfully small....I never saw them 
again - they probably hit a moose!

The verdict:  I think a 914 qualifies as a Porsche.

Subject: Re: car covers


I may not be the most informed person about car covers and where the 
technology has taken them in recent years, but I've seen car covers do 
more damage than good - on a couple occasions.

A friend had a cherried-out '56 Chevy all car-covered, but left it 
covered for about 2 years (through snow, etc) without checking it.  The 
chrome on the car started to rust under the cover.  Perhaps a pinhole 
developed or water/moisture just blew in - but however the moisture got 
there, the cover kept it from evaporating.

Another instance was where the wind chaffed the paint of the car with the 
cover.  THis wasn't a "rough" feeling fabric, either.  I suppose it's 
just like you can theoretically rub through your paint with the finest 
Carnuba wax - if you rub it long enough and as constantly as every breeze 
blows your car cover.

Technology may have improved - just my $.02.

It's probably time for a pedal assembly rebuild. The bushings are 
probably binding due to swelled bushings. I have this problem
on my 2 project cars (73 911E and 914/2.0).

Use new factory-style nylon bushings. It is not a difficult job but

For car covers I use only the ones from beverly Hills motoring.
In fact I use the blue guard I think they call it. Have used one on our
bonneville since 1987 and it is still going strong.

Do not use any cover in the rain. There is nothing worse in trying to fold
up and put away a wet cover. Let alone getting it dry.

Covers work great for sun and also as a theft deterint as most folks will
not go after a car with a cover as they don't know what awaits them under
the cover.

Subject: HRE Wheels - Bad experience

I recently had a disasterous mail-order experience with HRE Performance Wheels 
of Vista California.  I liked the look of their wheels from an ad in 
Excellence and ordered a set at over $3000.  That's where the nightmare 
begins:

(1)  I was initially promised delivery within three weeks.  I didn't receive 
the wheels for over 2 months.  They were then sent to my home, instead of to 
the address of my mechanic, where I asked that they be sent.

(2)  The wheels were sent with the wrong center caps (chrome instead of GPX 
white), and the center caps protruded from the wheel as opposed to the way 
they appeared in pictures they sent me in which they were machined flush with 
the wheel.  When I discussed this with HRE, they told me that "different 
center caps have a different fit" and that if I wanted them to look like they 
did in the picture, I would have to send the 4 wheels back to California for 
lathe machining.

(3)  After a couple of months on my car, the valve stems in 2 of the 4 wheels 
began to leak leading to flat tires, and requiring that I send the wheels back 
to HRE.

(4)  Since I had to send the wheels back to HRE for the valve stem repair, I 
asked that they fix the faulty center caps so they would appear as they did in 
the literature they had sent me. They told me I would have to pay for this.  
They didn't even offer to pay the shipping to get the valve stems repaired 
even though the wheels were still under warranty and less than 3 months old.

(5)  I didn't get the wheels back for 2 months.  Then they sent back the 
wheels, but didn't send back the tires.  Several calls and 3 weeks later, I 
finally received my tires.

(6)  The people at HRE have been rude, discourteous and obnoxious.  I had to 
threaten to reverse credit card charges to get any service at all.

In summary,  this has been the worst mail order experience of my life.  I've 
ordered Porsche parts and equipment from numerous companies and have never had 
problems.  If I could turn back the clock.......needless to say.....I'd order 
from elsewhere!!!!!!!!!!!

   You asked about rebuilt calipers.  Foreign Autoparts on Massachusetts 
Ave. in Arlington farms out caliper rebuilds to someone located somewhere in 
lovely Everett by-the-Sea).  They've done them for me a $80.00 per 
caliper and I've had no problems. (porsche and mercedes).  
   With regard to your pedals sticking, I'd say it's high time to pull 
the pedals out and install a bronze bushing set.  Well worth it.

: Hope this gives you some useful info for pricing.  What bearings are

The belts are fairly cheap, as you stated.  The rollers and sprockets that 
the belts ride against aren't real cheap, and are important to replace if they
aren't in good shape.  

I just finished chasing a similar squealing/whistling noise problem, and
ended up having the belts, and all the rollers and sprockets they ride on
replaced.  Mine is an 87 944S with about 76k miles that I've owned for about
three months, and I'm just too busy to have undertaken this myself right now,
even if I had known going in what to look for.  I spent just under $950 for
parts and labor, and am pleased with the results so far (160 miles or so
post-repair).

The rollers clearly had no grease left in the bearings and were starting to
"wobble" a bit.  One of the sprockets appeared to have a bearing that was 
coming apart, it sort of "clunked" around instead of turning smoothly, and 
was very noisy even when turned by hand.  Further, there was a chunk missing
from the external, multi-ribbed belt that drives the alternator, et al.  And 
we went ahead and put a new v-belt on the power steering pump for good 
measure since it's cheap and was off anyway.

There was also a weird noise around the end of the driven can, which turned
out to be some trash on the hall-effect sensor that feeds cam position info
to the DME, I guess?  The labor to pull the cover and find that, then clean
out the sensor and put things back together, probably added to the "normal"
bill for belts and rollers, if there is such a thing.

The balance shaft belt was *really* worn from running back and forth across
the rollers and sprockets due to the wobbling roller, and the squealing noise
was *very* un-Porsche-like...  I'm much happier now!

mujahid:

Call A.P.A. Industries at 818-361-9719.  They carry Evolution IV Technalon
(the Kimberly-Clark stuff) covers, custom fitted, for $95-$105 depending on
the vehicle.  I've bought six or seven such covers from them over the years
(they last about 2 years in the SF Bay Area, and one was stolen on
Halloween :(  ), and have been very happy with them and the product they
sell. All their covers (that IO have) fit like a glove.

Evolution IV is pretty cool stuff - it can rain for days and the car will,
at worst, have a faint "wet" smell underneath the cover -- the underside of
the cover will still be dry, though.  They certainly reduce the harmful
effects of the sun. These Evo IV covers fold up pretty bag -- don't even
think about putiing them in a trunk sack, day after day.

It is very powerful, and will tear skin right off your fingers.  However,

	The 71 911T Targa fit perfectly in the garage.  Now, I have
a couple of questions for the list.

	The engine is a 74 2.7 T.   What octane gas is best to use?
	I plan on changing the oil and filter this weekend.  Any good oils
or filters to use or bad ones to avoid?


	Lastly, 

	The targa top seems to leak not at all  :)

	Just to be safe - any companies that make a cover to protect the 
targa top from potential leaks??   I'd rather not get an entire car cover
if I could help it.  ANy good places that redo the vinyl(?) covering on the
targa top - it couls use a little work.


	Mu poor 914 will have to be patient while the new member of the family
settles in.

I've been using one which puts out 1500 psi. Does everything I've needed, 
and a neighbor borrowed it to clean the mess out of an MGB when the engine & 
trans were out. Did a spectacular job!

The smaller units would probably do a reasonably good job. Their main 
limitation is in the area of volume of output rather than psi. OK for small 
parts/jobs, but when you begin to find out all the things a pressure washer 
can do it may become a limitation.

FWIW mine is a 5 HP and puts out almost 3 gpm @ 1500 psi. Cost between $400 
and $500 and I wouldn't want much less.

Subject: faster!

This is a cloud-9 fantasy by someone who thinks his 928 isn't fast
enough. If you don't like this sort of thing, skip to the next
message... If you've actually _done_ this sort of thing, tell me how!

I am very happy with my car as-is. However, I have concluded that the
car of my dreams is a 928 with 500HP, limited-slip differential AWD,
and a six speed gearbox. I think this would necessarily also involve a
different clutch, perhaps crankshaft work?, I've never done anything
like this so I just don't know.
I want to keep the suspension as-is; perhaps slightly harder
springs. I want to keep the chassis, cockpit, and shell as-is also.

What does one have to do to a 1979 928 engine to get that sort of
horsepower? Is it possible? If so, how do the two turbochargers and
intercooler(s) fit into the already-crowded engine bay? What sorts of
modifications to timing/injection/camshaft/cylinder/piston/crankshaft
are standard fare for this sort of thing? Also, is the cooling
infrastructure going to lose its marbles? Instinct says yes, so how do
I fix?

I would like to have cockpit-controllable boost levels, from zero to
40PSI (*very very* high, race car territory (actually, those pressure
levels are against regulations in most if not all events now I
believe)). Are there turbos that can achieve this sort of pressure,
with <.5s turbo lag to full boost? I believe the way to achieve the
pressure modulation ability is to have some sort of valve system that
routes the exhaust into the turbo and exhaust pipe in varying
ratios. A similar configuration on the intake side would work, with
the necessary addition of a one-way valve (a simple slap-shut job
would work I think) to allow the turbo to do its thing when it is
generating pressure. This would allow the engine to operate with
entirely conventional aspiration, entirely turbocharged, or anywhere
inbetween, at will. I believe a new injector computer would have to be
integrated with the turbo system for this to work as advertised. A new
fuel pump is probably also needed, to achieve that dreamt-of 5MPG (heh
heh).

Because I plan to replace the entire post-engine powertrain, I think
concerns about the increased torque are taken care of. So, when one
buys a gearbox, can one choose the ratios, and will it fit where the
old one was? Will the higher-capacity clutch fit where the old one
was?

I would like to add another brake caliper to each of the wheels. Does
this necessitate a reworking of the entire brake system, starting with
a new master cylinder?

How can I fit three limited-slip differentials under the car, and
modify the front wheel mechanics to allow power transfer there? I
think this might be one of the harder things to do (most of the things
I want to do seem fraught with gotchas, come to think of it..).

A final addition is some modest aerodynamic enhancements: an airdam
and a modest, understated, but unique "signature" spoiler.

How much would all this cost in parts and hours? I am guessing 30
grand in parts and over 1000 hours by a genuine expert.

With the modifications, the car will weigh at least 3700 pounds
(an increase of 350 pounds). With that weight and limited-slip AWD,
will a 500HP engine be able to spin all four tires in a clutch-drop
launch, or will it just bog down? I would like the engine to be
powerful and tractable enough to spin the tires (in a straight line!)
at up to 30MPH. With this sort of weight, what sort of power curve
does the car need to achieve this? Target numbers are <=3.5s 0-60, <12s
through 1320 feet, <=100 feet 60MPH to 0MPH braking, top speed >=210MPH.

If I can build this monster, and the final product has real
refinement, is there a market for this sort of thing? Are there dozens
of people out there who would shell out 200 grand for a 928 that can
leave diablos and (1996) 911 turbos in the dust? Starting with a new
GTS engine (360HP), I would aim for over 600HP, creating a real
rocket, with real-world ergonomics (drive to work in it! you don't
look silly in one, more than can be said of a diablo or testarossa).

Maybe all I'm doing is reinventing the 959, sans four wheel steering,
with more power.

Subject: 914/914-6 Owners/Experts -- I need your help

I'm preparing a Tech Tip for Porschephiles on upgrading the front calipers
of the 914-4.  It's pretty in-depth (3000 words and counting), and covers a
whole lot of 914 brake and brake upgrade issues. 

I'd like to get my facts straight on the 914-6 (don't own one, :( ), so I'd
like to ask a few questions and would appreciate responses, with specs if
possible.  I've scoured my various manuals and catalogs, but many points
are still unclear. Here they are (there's a little overlap, but please bear
with me):


1) Are late (73-76) 914-4 front pads thicker than the early ones, and if so
by how much?

2) How do the early (70-72) and late (73-76) 914-4 front brake rotors
differ? See 8)

3) Does the 914-6 use the same proportioning valve as the 914-4? Does it
use one at all?

4) Does the 914-6 use the same pads front and rear? Do the 914-4 and the
914-6 share the same front pad, or does the thickness vary over the years?

5) What's the difference between the 914-4 (914.352.423/4.00) and 914-6
(914.352.901/2.00) rear calipers? Just the ability to accomodate a bigger
pad and thicker rear rotor on the 914-6?

6) What's the difference between the 914-4 rear axle flange and that of the
914-6?  Did the early 914-4 units have reinforcements to permit 5-stud
mountings?

7) Am I correct in saying that the 914-6 uses _exactly_ the same front
struts, brakes and rotors as the same vintage 911 with vented front rotors?
If close but no cigar, what's the difference?

8) When did the switch to hubcentric front rotors occur on the 914-4? In
73? Is that the only difference between 411.407.075 and .075B? See 2)

Thanks,

The 924 was discontinued in 1985, and the 924S came in 1986 as a

Reason to this was to give catalythic equipped cars same performance as 
they used to have with the non-cat 163 hp engine. This was the general 
Porsche philosophy at the time, that cars should not suffer from tougher 
emission laws (in Europe...).

>In 1990 and 91 the only 944 sold in the US was the S2, which was produced in

Also the 944 Turbo was being produced until 1991, sold mainly in Germany.

In addition, Porsche also produced the 944 Turbo Cup, for a special racing 
series in Europe. This car was available in 1987-89. Production figures I 
don't know, and for tech details I have to dive into the bookshelf, will take 
some time... Maybe someone else can fill in?
What I remember is: top speed in 1987 about 170 mph, suspension upgrade 
included coil-overs in the rear, bigger brakes (same as 944 Turbo S?) and a
roll cage. If you U.S. guys want one, please don't buy Swedish because I
want to get one myself and there aren't to many of them here (two 89's) ;-)

I mentioned the 968 Turbo S (ADAC-GT racing series homologation car) a

I've seen some ads claiming 20 produced. Also, price in 1993 was 175.000 DEM.

Hello all,

I have a 911 tune up/maintenance video for sale.  It's the one out of 
Performance magazine.  I've viewed it several times and have no need 
for it now (I've memorized it).  It's in excellent condition.  It has 
the following contents:

Short history of Porsche
Safety
Tools you need
Overview of engine components, suspension and brakes
changing spark plugs 
Analyzing spark plugs
Replacing fan belt
replacing oil & oil filter
replacing transmission oil
changing cap, rotor, points
timing
valve adjustment
engine removal
Preventive maintenance

The video is about an hour long.  I have found it to be invaluable 
especially when you are getting started with just the haynes manual.

Price I paid was $49.95
Price I'll sell for $39.95 + s&h

Broken 3 spoke steering wheels are easily fixed.

1. Undo the stitching on the leather cover.
2. Slit the rubber padding.
3. Neatly MIG weld the joint.
4. Glue rubber back.
5. Re-stitch the leather.

This takes an hour or two but saves $$$ and works well.

Subject: 914 smokin 

Hello all,

I am still having problems with my 914 blowing smoke out the
valve cover vents and the crank vents. Appears to be a light misty
smoke, maybe gas? No smoke coming out the tail pipe.

here is the situation:
914 2.0 motor with 40 IDF carbs.
Pertronix Ignitor and Bosch blue coil.
Motor rebuilt top to bottom 4 years ago,  approx 40,000 miles.
Running carbs for 6 years.

I have checked or replaced the following:
Oil and filter replaced
Spark plugs replaced
spark plug wires replaced
removed top of carbs and checked float level
cleaned jets and float bowl on carbs (looked OK)
swapped coil 
checked timing
checked air flow on all 4 venturies

After running for a while, rechecked the new plugs. #1 seems a 
little too clean, like it's not firing much on the idle circuit. Unplugged
#1 plug wire, not much change, just a little rough at high idle 
3000 rpm.  Plugged #1 back in, unplugged #2....engine dies.

I have been running the same carb setup for several years now, so
it is jetted and set up more or less correctly. 

I had noticed some smoke occasionally for the past couple of
months. Two weeks ago I left the car at the tire store for alignment.
When I picked it up it was running rough on idle but OK once under
power. After driving the 15 miles home on the highway, it was 
smoking heavily from the vents and would hardly idle.  My first thought was
that they may have turned the ignition key to unlock the 
steering wheel for the alignment, which also turns on the fuel
pump. If left on for a while I figured it could have dumped some gas
into the motor. So I changed the oil....but its still smoking. I haven't
driven it more than a few miles so the oil temp has not gotten over 
180 for any extended period.

Questions:
could I still have some gas in the new oil?
could the carbs need new needle valves? 
could this be worn valve guides, rings, burned piston??

This ones got me stumped.

Fellow Pfiles and Distinguished PCA Members,

As much as I hate to do this, a pending domicile purchase is forcing
me to part w/ my dearly beloved SC.  Yes Listmeister Stan and Unka' Bart,
I know you can sleep in your Pcar and you cannot drive your house, but 
I'm having difficulty mounting the tv in the dash ;).
I am going to post this to the list before I adv. locally, so if anyone 
is interested you may have first chance.  Here goes:

'79 911SC Coupe w/ 150450 miles, # 9119201937

Dark Copper Metallic (Chocolate Brown) w/ Camel Interior.
Leather is in excellent shape (no cuts or rips),
No cracks in dash. AC ok.

16x8 Honeycomb Enkie's w/ Yokohoma AV1-50i's  in rear.
16x7 Honeycomb Enkie's w/ Pirelli P7's in front.

Engine has all current updates: C-tens, air box flap, oil reg, etc.

Clutch was replaced approx 2 months ago w/ Sachs kit. TO bear, p-plate,
disk, along with flywheel resurfaced.

Case was split at 80k miles and inspected for wear, everything was in
spec.  Updated studs were installed.

Has Lucas H-4's w/ 100-80w bulbs. Blau Charleston w/ Blau door and 
Kenwood rear speakers.

Currently using Castrol 5w50 Syn.

There are (2) small areas of rust that need attention. 1) just behind
the fuel door and 2) drivers side door strike area.  I was planning to
replace the left front fender and door strike area this summer while
having it painted.

Records were mis-placed by previous owner (Patent Attorney) but we can talk to 
the local mechanic who has done most all of the maintenance.

I could not decide which one to part w/ the 72S or 79SC.  Finally came to
the conclusion that I can always find another SC or Carerra but not a 72S.

The key reason that I purchased this SC was that I knew the mechanic and
he practically knew the complete history of the car.  The car is extremely
solid and with a new paint job it would make an excellent 1st Pcar or
daily driver.

Please email me directly if anyone is interested.
I am asking $11,900 FOB Camden, IN.  Approx 1 hour N of Indy.

Since removing #1 causes very little change in the idle - you either have 
a bad spark plug wire, fouled contact point for #1 in the disti-cap or 
another bad spark plug.  The oredr of presentation here is the most 
likely order to solve the problem.  What you are seeing is the unburned 
gas from #1 being thrown out of the exhaust and, possibly, back through 
the recirc from the blow-by.

Subject: Advice on busted 914 torsion bar replacement?

DD,
cc: Porschephiles

Thanks for the info (and your artistry!-) on the motor mounts.  I'll have to 
compare your ASCII art with the car.  Unfortunately, the welding must wait (oh, 
gotta call the welder today), since I busted a torsion bar yesterday (driver's 
side).  Car's sitting on its wheel, and the adjuster for the ride 
height/torsion bar moves in my hand (but is rusted solid so I don't think it's 
stripped splines).

So, I'm trying to figure out if it's worth taking it in to someone (2 hours per 
side, $55/hr, plus they order parts from AutoMotion!  Something like $500+ _if_ 
the bars/bolts aren't rusted in there solid).  Any advice on doing it myself?  
(probably end up replacing the bushings while I'm in there, especially if I 
have to take the whole A-arm off the car.)  Are used bars a bad idea?  Or 
replacing just the one?

Thanks, as always.

Thwen.

This is actually an interesting question from a chemistry
          point of view. Being an analytical chemist and not a
          inorganic chemist this is not my direct forte. I will give
          my attempt at an explanation.

          Here goes; First we need to think about what corrosion is to
          understand the chemistry involved. Corrosion, as used in
          this E-Mail, would be the oxidation of metals to form metal
          salts and  precipitates. Different metals will oxidize to
          form different metal salts. Rust is the classic oxidation
          product of Iron.

          For those who forgot their general chemistry oxidation is
          the loss of electrons. This is promoted by what is called a
          oxidizing agent. An oxidizing agent is something that wants
          an electron or is electron deficient. Chlorine (Cl) is one
          of the best oxidizing agents there is. Cl is one electron
          short of a full electron state.  So it will take an electron
          from anywhere it can.

          Next we must look at what metals come in contact with the
          coolant to figure out what things may be corroded. In most
          cars that would be Iron (Fe), Aluminum (Al), and steel
          (which is a blend of Fe, Carbon, and other metals, like
          Nickel (Ni) and Chromium (Cr). Any of these can be oxidized.

          Al is easily oxidized, more so then Fe or steel. The reason
          that Al looks dull is the surface is oxidized and this
          prevents further oxidation. If you polish Al it will oxidize
          immediately and if you continue to polish it will continue
          to oxidize.

          Now to the heart of the matter. Why did they Al in distilled
          water oxidize more then in tap? The answer is that distilled
          water is more reactive then tap water. This is because in
          distilled water you need to think of the water as a lose
          association of H+ and 2O- ions. These ions can react or
          oxidize metals. Tap water has other ions like (Fe3+, Mg3+,
          Fe2+, Ca2+, Cl-, F-).  These ions will form lose
          associations with the H+ and the O- and make the water less
          reactive.

          The bottom line is that you should use antifreeze and tap
          water as your coolant. Antifreeze is designed to help
          prevent corrosion. At some other time I can talk about what
          is in antifreeze and how it works.

As Murray Wilkes points out, the three spoke steering wheel can be 
repaired. It will also break again if you are autocrossing or on the 
track. This is why I am recommending the four spoke steering wheel as a 
replacement.

If your wheel breaks on an 85 or earlier 944, you can use a 924 two spoke
steering wheel in a pinch.

Any 924 owner can upgrade to a three or four spoke steering wheel from 
the early 944. 

Or you can use a VW chain steering wheel if you desire. (VBGrin)

It's always best to replace these as a matched pair.  You can replace 
just the one, but I would suspect that if ONE was weak enough to snap, 
then just how long can you trust the other?

You can replace these with little grief.  Here's what I did:

Lift the entire front at least 20" and make sure that the jackstands are 
NOT directly behind the rear of the torsion bar tube.

(of course, the wheels are off)

Remove the front valance

Remove the protective cup (uses a hex wrench) - two bolts each side.

    On three cars that I've worked on, there's been small holes in the front 
    cap of the torsion bar tube.  On one, it was solid.  Since the 
    three were stock, I suspect that either the holes are factory, or
    someone was looking out for me.

Loosen/remove the adjusting bolt and then remove the rear section of the 
bar in the adjuster.

Using the hole I mentioned above (or a close facsimile) spray a volume 
of Liquid Wrench or WD-40 into the tube.

Using a small metal rod, tap the remainder of the rod out of the rear of the
tube. 

Spray the splines on both ends of the new torsioin bars with a light oil or 
WD-40

Insert the new bars.

Place the adjuster onto the rear splines.

Insert the adjustment bolt and set to the middle of the travel.

Put the wheels bacl on

Lower the car and examine the set of the tires.  I actually had my 
neighbor sit in the car before I looked.

raise the frontend enough to relieve the pressure on the bars and adjust 
based on your inspections.

Drive around the block and then reexamine the set.  Repeat this until 
satisfied with the results.

I'm not claiming that this is 100% factory, but then again, it beats 
$55/hr times two sides!

Dear John:
Two things immediately came to mind:
1. The head temperature sensor is failing. This can be checked by
substituting a grounded wire for the sensor. If the problem disappears
replace the sensor. It is located at the right rear of the engine and its
lead exists through the cylinder cover.

2. The fuel pump circuit is momentarily failing. Either the fuse or relay is
temporarily losing connection and the pressure is dropping. Hot wire the fuel
pump and install a high pressure fuel guage between the two drivers side
injectors to monitor pressure.

While I certainly won't try to argue chemistry with Barry, the

Unfortunately, I found out that others don't take care of their cars, even 
a Porsche, like I do.  So far I've rebuilt the front end, replaced all the 
rotors and brake pads (the previous owner didn't have the wear sensors 
hooked up), replaced the alternator brushes, and the fuel pressure 
regulator.

Two months ago the balance shaft belt broke and became fouled up in the 
timing belt.  As I tore into it I found at least one bent valve.  A number 
of people I've talked to advised me to do a complete rebuild on the engine 
because of the number of miles on it: 120,000

Does anybody know of anything particularly touchy that I need to know about 
as I rebuild this engine?  The only oil pump I've seen in a catalog was 
over $500!  Is this possible?  While I have the engine out  I want to 
replace the clutch but I don't want the one with the rubber piece on the 
pressure plate.  

I am beginning to wonder if it is economically worthwhile to rebuild this 
car.

Any suggestions?

Subject: How does 944 cooling sys. work?

Hi all,

Please help me to fully underdstand how my 85.5 944's cooling 
system works. I sometime think mine behaves strangely, because
some hot summer days, in city driving, temp gauge cycles in
between middle two marks (which is how. I think, it should be).

Occasionally, however, temp gauge stays steady close to the
lower middle mark (no recycling) even in heavy city hot day 
driving. What worries me is the loud whining sound coming from
the engine. This whining does not change with rpm. 
Is it oil cooler or what? I have noticed that it usually happens
when I use the A/C. But even after turning off the A/C, I does
not stop.

Can somebody please explain me what is going on together with
how the system works ?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Armagan.

I'd like to offer a counter to the above.  I bought a factory cover last
year and it's unquestionably the best car cover I've ever had (and I've
had alot).  It is light and easy to use while providing great sun and 
water repellency with good breathability.  I unfortunatly have to leave
my car outside all the time (no garage right now) and I pay alot of 
attention to my cover performance.  I'm not all that cost conscious, but
this was also quite a good deal.  I haven't tried Ultralon, but I'd 
recommend against Evolution.  Aside from being bulky, it degrades into
some kind of funny state wherein it always leaves a nasty film all over
the windows and paint, in addition to "Ultralon particles".  Kind of like
ArmorAll outgassing does to the inside of a car (although no one who is 
reading this would use ArmorAll I know).

I'd give the factory cover a try, the shiny coating keeps the interior
temp down and I've got about a year of constant use on mine and it just
looks a little dirty, no other signs of deterioration.

Besides it says Porsche on it and its not overpriced, how often to I
get to buy a "part" like that?

Subject: 951 and zero oil pressure

I got a good scare yesterday on the way home from work.  I was doing a max 
boost run down this twisty road going thru the gears shifting at 5500k.  When 
I hit 3rd gear somewhere around 4000-5000 rpm, the engine lost power suddenly 
and the oil pressure dropped to **ZERO** bar and the red light came on.  The 
engine still ran and would rev freely in neutral but there was no response to 
throttle input.   I couldn't pull over right away due to the traffic in the 
right lane and coasted to a stop with the engine still running about 500 yards
away.  I killed the engine immediately to prevent further damage.  I thought I
had blown my engine but when I checked under the hood, the large (2.5" diam) 
metal hose to the intercooler had popped out from the rubber hose (going to 
the turbo?) right above the airbox.  I got out the tool-kit (Thank you, 
Porsche, for being so thoughtful), and had the hose back together in 5 minutes
and the engine started right up with regular oil pressure.  

Now, I think I left the hose too loose the last time I worked on the car and 
it worked itself loose under the max boost conditions, but why would the oil 
pressure drop to zero????  What is the likelihood of any engine damage under 
the above scenario?  What is the correct action to take if you lose oil 
pressure suddenly?? I didn't want to switch off the ignition and lose steering
control as I maneuvered between traffic.  

P.S. 1/2 hour later, I had to rescue my wife because the clutch went on her 
car.  When it rains...

You should coat the entire new bar with grease before
inserting it, especially the splined ends. 

You may want to use 911 19mm torsion bars instead
of the stock 914 ones, as they are readily available and will
match many of the stiffer rear coil springs available.
This will make the car handle better (unless you have 
the soft stock rear springs) but ride slightly stiffer.

My guess is the hi-speed fan that comes on when you turn on the A/C.
My electic fans switch to high speed (depending on engine temp) when
the A/C is turned on and when the A/C is switched off, it takes a few
seconds before the fans return to normal speed.

Subject: 914 starter advice needed


I'm in the middle of a cross-country trip in my 914 and am having
trouble with the starter.

Power gets to the solenoid when I turn the ignition to 'start', and
power gets to the big terminal on the starter (the one straight from the
battery).  The solenoid clicks feebly and the alternator and oil light
dim when I try to start it.

After a day of driving without shutting the engine off (from Salt Lake
City to San Francisco) I was all ready to replace the starter & solenoid
but today the car starts fine.

So what's the diagnosis?  Do solenoids typically fail intermittently?

I seem to remember reading about a 914 modification wherein a relay is
added somewhere in the starting circuit - does this sound familiar to
anyone?

I hope to at least understand the problem (if not rememdy it) before I
start the return trip to Illinois in about a week...

At least a 914 is easy to push-start.  They should put more gas stations
at the tops of hills.

        Auto Atlanta and AutoMashin' both sell "fixes" of this type.
Something else to check is the ground strap between the tranny and the
chassis.  That's the major ground path for the starter.  I seem to re-
member that there was a heat-induced problem where that ground wasn't
working so the current found another ground through something else... ?

It goes in the driver's side battery box.  Sidewise.
You'll have to fashion a hold down strap.  It's
pretty straightforward.

Don't forget tio disconnect or cover the other

Barry,  your point about distilled water being a loose association
of 2H+ and O- ions is understandable, I've long forgotton my chem
courses but doesn't this imply that the attraction of the H+ and O-
ions is weaker than the O- and Al+?  Ifso, I guess it makes sense..

I always thought it better to use distilled because I was concerned
that any dissolved minerals in tap water would precipitate and leave
deposits and scaling when the water temperature is raised, then 
lowered. (like in a water heater)

Is it a strange black substance that is almost like rubber?  Maybe **that**
is what the crap was all over in front trunk of my latest chassis.  It was
in the engine compartment as well.  What a mess.

I used a scraper at first (some came right off others left residue) and

alot of painstaking work to do by hand.  I'm currently in the process of

Hella:	0 231 174 007

Then I snagged one from a wrecked '72-1.7  Its numbers are:

Hella:  0 231 174 005

It did a decent but not great job on the car. It cleaned up areas like
wheelwells and suspension components ok. But baked on oil/grease under the

unit would test my patience. You'll probably still want to spray on some
sort of degreaser anyway to loosen up the crud.

Well, I guess that it depends on what you mean by "repair"...

If your end caps are broken, and that is keeping the "roller shade" from 
returning, then you need to buy new end caps (available from the dealer for 
about $22 each) and pop-rivet them in place, with the proper amount of 
tension on the spring...

Simple, yet effective.

Or, you could buy a used one from me...   :-)  After all, "Her Majesty" is

economic activities concerning low prices?


> And you know "nothing" about Porsches?

Uhhhh, I believe that is a little of an overstatement.  I know little about
Porsches.  I know a little about a lot of other kinds of cars, though.
I have never owned a Porsche before, so I used the term "nothing" to 
place emphasis on my deficit for knowledge about the car I had just 
bought.  Pardon me if you find the concept incomrehensible.  I belive it 
was a simple and straightforward concept.


> And you rhapsodize about a hopped-up Camaro?

A "rhapsody" would mean that I am overly enthusiastic about a hopped-up
Camaro.  I do not believe that over-enthusiasm was involved in my 
mentioning of the Camaro.  I'm sorry that it is so difficult for you to
understand.  My mentioning of the Camaro was implemented to compare and 
contrast its performance aspects and potential with that of my Porsche 944.  
The intent was to learn of any possible modifications and results 
analgous to those I mentioned about the Camaro.  I simply stated value 
free observations I had made about the Camaro's performance, and the only 
evaluation I made of the car was a short "best bang for buck."  A vacuous 
imbecille could reach that conclusion from reading automotive magazine
headlines or comparative performance evaluations.  I didn't say that it was 
"better" or that "I'd rather have" one, nor did I advocate that I or any 
Porsche driver should dump their Porsches and get one.  Gee, is it 
even o.k. to *mention* some other brand of car merely for comparison 
to my Porsche?  I think you're way out of line, hoss.


> Say, aren't you on the wrong list?

Just a minute - let me look out the window.   Oh, there - I see my Porsche
still in the driveway.  I cite that fact as evidence that I am in the 
correct list.  Thank you for your concern.

> My advice is to sell your low-mileage 944 to someone who'll appreciate

So noted.  However, I feel it worth mentioning to you that your advice - 
and your erroneous assumption that I do not appreciate the car - are of 
no concern to me, so you might as well internalize your opinions.  I 
already appreciate Detroid heavy metal for what it can does well, and I 
slight it for what it does not do well.  I have found that I gain a 
better appreciation for something as I learn more about it.  As I have 
not owned the Porsche very long, I have yet to fully experience the car.
I have yet to try "autocross" racing and the other members of the list have
piqued my interest.

  I find the proceedings in question to be an entirely
sensible sequence of events:  see car, like car, buy car, drive car,
want more, ask about getting more [caution: this step may involve 
comparison, contrast, and anology], receive answers from the rest of the 
list, satisfy curiosity.  THEN you come in whining and asking me to 
leave.  I'd just as soon we drop it and you save bandwidth.  However, if 
you have any questions about what I really think about you and your

I don't know what endgine bad adhesive is., but:  I once took a pinstripe

$34K for an RS America is dirt cheap.  The only reason
I could see someone selling one for this little is that
the car has been wadded up and subsequently repaired.
Most of the examples I've seen run in the mid $40K range.

Subject: Adhesive removal

The safest product for adhesive removal is trichloroethane, which is
harder to get than it used to be.  Glass shops use a spray version
called "Quick Release Agent."  It is pretty benign as far as paint is
concerned, and softens rubber-based cements.

I haven't used 3-M Adhesive Remover, which may be the same substance.
BUT I'd be careful with other brands.  There's a Jasco Adhesive
Remover which is basically a paint remover.  Check the chemical
composition:  1-1-1 trichloroethane is what you want; methylene
chloride is *not*--unless you want to have your paint emulsify into a
washable goo!

Mineral spirits ("paint thinner") is cheap and readily available.
It'll do the job...eventually.

911 factory LSD, much like all of the Porsche LSDs since the '50s, is a multi
disk clutch affair. Slippage of a wheel causes power transfer via a collection
of friction and pressure disks, etc. Lockup is pre-set at some point to
facilitate maximal power transfer without really eating up the clutches.
Needless to say, the clutch disks are a wear item, have to be rebuilt with
some frequency. In the 356 world, rule of thumb is an LSD is good for about
10k street miles or a nearly infinite number of track miles. The 911 LSDs
are a lot better, but should still be considered a routine service item
at about 50k intervals.

The Quaiffe is a licensed version of the Gleason-Torsen torque sensing
differential. It uses a complex interwoven planetary gear setup to send
power to the wheel best able to use that power. It does not have a lockup
mode. The Gleason-Torsen is *WIDELY* used in high-power four-wheel drive
applications, as it is nearly indestructable, can transmit tons of power,
and is *NOT* a maintenence item.

I've compared (via seat of pants and stopwatch testing) the Quaffe, the
factory LSD, and a welded locker diff on the 914 and late 911s (915 gears).
For a full-race car that has enough power, and a driver that knows how
to drive such a thing, the locker is faster on high-speed courses. For
"Joe Average" (and maybe even "Joe A Little Above Average"), or for
low speed courses, and all autox applications, the Quaiffe is clearly the
best setup. The LSD is best reserved for those situations where sanctioning
body (like the Sports Car Communist Assholes) rules stipulate use of
the factory parts to remain in a "stock" class.

Define "variable". You can set the factory LSD lock-up when you're 
installing or rebuilding it. But not once it's in without taking it out.

See above.

we long ago (1975 ) stopped using it and used IPA ( iso propyl alcohol )

I once had a ziebart treated motor ( my trusted TR6 ) it used to p*ss me

every time I cleaned the engine bay I was left with a pool of oozing

After that, I went and bought one of those big plactic trays that brickies

It seems to me that if you got a bill of sale from the dealer, then you've
got a sales contract for that amount stated on the bill of sale.  I'd 
contact a lawyer and have him send a nasty note to the dealer.  You seem
to be on pretty firm ground here.   Further evidence of sale is that the
dealer accepted the bank wire as payment for the car and let you have

The trouble with tap water is that it is an unknown quanity

in some areas it it full of lime, and thus tends to cause little damage 
in other areas it can be slightly acidic - for example water running off 
off peat bogs (scotland etc) 

the acid areas pose the big problem, because you have a nice little 
battery cooking away, copper rad, aluminium head, and sundry iron 
components all washed in weak acid. I once took to bits a 2 year old 
central heating system that had been run with acidic tap water. the 
pressed steel rads were full of FeO not rust but black iron oxide, there 
were numerous pin holes in the rads.

I guess that the manufacturers say distilled water, so they can be fairly 
certain of what they are mixing with the anti-freeze

In my opinion the only battery to use is the Optima 8000 dry cell battery so 
you no longer have to worry about corrosion problems due to the battery. 
I've been told it has more cranking power than the two original batteries. 
The only catch is you have to mount it on it's side but it's really no 
problem since these batteries do not have to be mounted upright.

	I'm an idiot!!!

	Last night I closed my door  -  however, the latch (u-shaped) was
down and when the latch hit the plate inside door frame, it broke.


	We are talking about a 71 911.


	The door closes, but it appears that the u-shaped part on the door is 
moving too much inside the door.  Is there a washer or something in there or
is it made of the pot metal that breaks when you do dumb things?


	Repairable or weldable or merely replaceable?


	It looks like the window frame has to come out before this piece can
be removed, so I thought I check the list experts before disassembly.

I have a 1975 914 and I plan to put in a Carerra 3.2 engine with a 915 
gearbox.  As the gearbox would be in a different location a cable linkage 
system would be needed.  Has anyone heard of Patrick's Motorsport out of 
Arizona that offers such a cable system.  Is it good.

Given the weight of the 914, I hope that this engine combination would 
give it a good power to weight ratio and make it a quick 914.

I also plan to upgrade the brakes to the 911 brakes.  

I would really appreciate  it if anyone can offer me technical tips or 
suggestion for such a conversion. Any idea on how fast would this car be.

I plan to take this car on the track and would also be grateful for

Subject: Porsche 944 Engine Durability / 911 Costs


Hi Porschephiles,

By the end of summer I hope to be a Porsche owner. I'm not a "newbie" per se,
I've been on the list for the past six months and have read the FAQ's so I
know the standard stuff (timing belts, water pumps, maintenance records, etc)
I have come across a couple good prospects in the past and the list has been
most helpful in offering advise. Thanks!

My new question is: How many miles can you get from a 944 engine without 
doing a rebuild ? (Assume average maintenance, I know YMMV :) 

I ask this because there is a '87 944 advertised w/ 130k miles for asking price 
$5,000. Sounds to good to be true! (Haven't seen it yet, it probably is :)


Also, I've gotten 944 average yearly maintenance costs estimates from list 
members in the $1,000 to $2,000 range. What would maintenance costs on a 
74-77 911S run me ? (I know about the 2.7 durability issue :)


As always thanks for any and all advise!

Subject: 77s -> 87 turbo, The Story, long

Since so many have asked about 77s-87turbo here goes:

The story goes like this:

Boy has 77s drives it around, thought it was pathetic, (tired suspension, 
sticky pedals,a/c that didnt, IMHO weak motor for the weight of the car) 
sells motor to Joe Povi aka man with dp 935, looks around and finds an 87 
turbo drivetrain and suspension for sale.
Buys it.
During the 6 month project many people saw it in the shop and made comments, 
some
were sorry to see a 77s cut up to be a turbo, others thought it was a neat 
idea; pretty
obvious what I thought.  Just for kicks I drove it by the original owner that 
I bought it
from, he couldnt believe it was the same car,  (He is a realtor and opened an 
office 1mile from the shop)  He asked for a ride; I said no just to be a 
a-hole.

Motor had 29k miles on it, with one of those big ss exhaust systems on it.
Front suspension went in easy, just a few bolts had to be ordered for the 
thicker mounts.
Rear suspension was another story, it turns out that 87 rear susp arms are 
SHORTER
then 77s.  So new brackets had to fabed and installed, easier done then said.

Then we went to bolt the motor in, but the tranny mount wants to push the 
motor
back 1.5 inches, so a new crossmember had to be fabd, and some room made for
the turbo.

Electric, hole had to be drilled to run wires to mount computer under driver 
seat, no big deal, a little bit of harness work was done to wire in the dual 
fuel pumps and different CD box, no big deal.

I fitted 8x15 in the front and 10x15 fuchs in the rear, glass front fenders, 
steel turbo
rear quarters, glass IROC turbo tail. (big)

People break their necks trying to look at it, right now its in yellow primer 
getting ready
for MR2 yellow paint. This color is a little more green then the turbo 
yellow.
I like it, we painted the tail that color to test it, looks great.

The whole project took about 6mos to complete, and a lot of money.
Worth it, yes and no.
No in that It took so long and I will probably have to sell it, tho I dont 
want too.
Yes in that it is lighter then an 87 turbo and has the same 
brakes/suspension...

Oh if any one is interested in it, the price is 22k firm.

Other mods: turbo pedal assembly, turbo oil cooler in rt front fender, new 
radio,
new windshield with antenna in glass.

If there is enough interest i will post a picture.

Mike said that 911 19mm torsion bars will fit the 914.  I was under the
impression (perhaps false) that the bars are different.  Has anyone actually
done it?  I am sorry if I doubt Mike's advice.  I have a pair of these
around and am running 140 lbs springs, without rear sway bars.  I will be
doing more driver's ed events this year and wondered if it is a good idea to
run rear sways (the fronts are 22 mm Weltmeisters).  I also have 3 year old
KYB gas shocks.  Will Koni's give me noticeable advantages?

Now that I got myself going, I'll ask more questions: Anyone have any
experience with racing seats (Konigs are quite expensive but do not have
shoulder support)? What other seats fit the 914?  Anyone want to sell me
one, used one is fine? Anyone interested in getting rid of their roll cage?

I'll pass it along through our internal mail. He has a '78 911

Sure fire: point out to him that if he fails to deliver the appropriately

Hi Naresh

I am a high mileage 944 driver, my current stead now has 127k miles.

My engine appears to have plenty of life left in it, however there are 
lots of other things that tend to wear out.

as you have been round the list for a while, you will know about engine 
mounts, brake rotors, cam belts.

I would also add interior trim, if the trim is tatty, expect to spend 
$1000 to buy replacement seats lockerbox etc. I also have a shot radiator 
$200.

window lifters may be worn, the list is endless

Right now to get my machine back to a lets say "good condition" would 
cost me around $2000.

If the engine was seized solid, a replacement engine from george b would 
cost say $1500, so seen in that light you can see that you need to 
consider carefully the whole condition of the car. If you can find an 
early car with say 60k miles for another 2k or so then I think I would 
try to find the extra cash ( yeh I know about student funds ) anyway go 
look at it, make a comprehensive list of things you want to check, then 
be carefull it's easy to get seduced once the engine goes rrrm.

Oh by the may, if the owner turns the hi-fi on before he starts the 
engine, you can guarantee he is trying to hide some unpleasant noise.

Have fun

Hi All,
  Am laying groundwork for switching over to 5-lug 16"x6" 911 wheels/brakes on
my '76 2.0 914.  I'm interested in a long lasting (big commute miles) compound
for the 16" tires.  I realize that this wheel format is intended for high
performance and thus (usually) soft "grippy" compounds.  Who makes a 16" (50ser
es) tire that leans toward the hard compound/high mileage side?  My definition
of "high mileage" is a tire that is good for about 40K miles. What is price
range for these tires.  ( I would expect around $ 150/ea)
  Also, anyone have any 914-6 rear hubs they want to unload?
   Now the Politics:  Regarding the "Camaro-Admirer or XXXXXX-Brand Bashing", I
                     feel that comparisons or even COMPLIMENTS toward other
                     brands and models is ENTIRELY appropriate in this forum. I
                     use this People-Base as a resource to LEARN as much as I
                     can about PORSCHES.  Since I have the HUMILITY to ADMIT
                     that I HAVEN'T owned or driven or got to know intimately

                     for comparisons to be made to cars I am familiar with.
                     The use of ANALOGY is a very POWERFUL learning tool.
    Camaros do some things very well where Porsches are quite pathetic, and

Subject: 951 Oil Pressure Indication


Steve Jagernauth reported that the oil pressure dropped and the oil light
came on when the intake tube worked loose on his 951.

This is probably normal for the Motronic system when this occurs. The 
system is all elctric, the idiot light comes on when there is ignition
on but no fire on the engine. The event reset the ignition to the "on"
but engine not running point. The loss of indicated oil pressure is 
because the engine ignition and the DME box were off, electrically 
speaking. 

This can happen to all CIS and DME equipped Porsches when the intake
tract develops a sudden, massive air leak between the throttle plate 
and the airflow sensor. 924 owners have had one of the rubber tubes pop
off the intermediate tube with the same results Steve had. 

If this occurs, do as Steve did, reconnect the loose pieces and the car 
will start. If something occured that was expensive, you will hear it or 
see no or low oil pressure.

I have seen very few 924/944/928s with any sort of massive oil pump/
system failures outside of the oil cooler on the 944. Failures seen on
track vehicles were concentrated at #2 main and rod bearings for other 
reasons. If you have a bad 944 motor mount, it can break the oil pickup
tube in the sump. I have two from club members that managed to catch the 
problem before it ruined the bearings.

If you have any reason to suspect oil pressure, substitute a mechanical
gauge at the point the stock gauge takes pressure and compare. I have 
had a few bad VDO senders and gauges in my cars. One did go to zero and
gave me a real start. I tapped it and it worked again for 15 minutes.

I would suggest a chat with the District Attorney.  You have the bill of 
sale and proof of payment.

Alternatively, if your state is like California, (cough) you could file a 
lost title form, signed by a rep from the insurance company, bypassing 
slimebag dealer altogether.  Personally, I'd like to see the dealer get his 
ass kicked.

Subject: Big Brakes for a Modified '75 911S

	I am in the process of rebuilding a 1975 911S, upgrades are numerous 
but include a Kremer built 3.2, with K-jetronic and SSI's, based on an SC 
case, Carrera flares and attendant tire size increases to 17 inch (255/40 rear 
and 205/50 front).

Question is whether anyone out there has had any experience with adding the 
power brake booster to a non-power brake equipped car, and secondly, has 
anyone out there have any experience with any of the numerous big brake 
upgrades. My bias is towards using the C2 Turbo "red" calipers, but I am not 
sure how the other options would work and how reliable and well engineered are 
the adapters which mount them. I currently have the type M calipers all 
around, and expect to have to use bolt on adapter pieces.

Other question is what to do about rotors and the mounting of them. Any 
experiences which perhaps I can learn from? It makes sense to me to move to 
the cross drilled rotors which would match the C2 calipers, but have looked 
with lust at the aluminum composite rotors in Panorama...

Car will be a street driver, odd bit of track time (for the fun of it), but 
since I may be transferrred back to Europe for a while I want to be able to 
bahnstorm with the best of them!!

REGARDING                911 search 

Hi Gang,

O.K., so the 912E wasn't such'a hot idea.  Thanks for all the info, even the
loving owners of 912E's alluded to the fact that it's a bit under powered(a
dog!), thermal units...overheating, a/c brackets that are prone to breakage,
parts that are no longer available.....the general consensus seemed to be
"hold out for the 911, if you can't afford that, get a 914!"

So the S.O., after a quick drool on the nice neighbor's beautiful Petrol
Blue'79 SC, has given in.  The "search" is now back to the 911.

More questions:
Spoilers-Were the "Factory Spoilers" a dealer installed option or did the cars
come from the factory with them.  How could you tell (and would you care?) if
the spoilers were install after purchase?  Are any of the after market
spoilers "better" than the factory?  I understand that the factory spoilers
have a second a/c condenser in them, would this be a way to discover a
nonoriginal installation? Were they a common option?  If I find "THE CAR" and
it doesn't have the spoiler kit, how big of a deal is it to add($$?) and how
does it affect the cars value(+-).

86 A/C vents- I've been told that the '86 P-car has better A/C vents, a big
deal here in the desert! Are the Fresh air/heater and A/C vents different duct
systems? Is there a really noticeable improvement?  I rather not rule out
pre'86 cars, but if the A/C was marginal before, it's a big factor. Forty five
consecutive days over110F last summer!!!

87 G-50(?) transmission- same questions as the A/C, is this a big deal or just
an incremental improvement?

Hi Porschephiles,

By the end of summer I hope to be a Porsche owner. I'm not a "newbie" per se,
I've been on the list for the past six months and have read the FAQ's so I
know the standard stuff (timing belts, water pumps, maintenance records, etc)
I have come across a couple good prospects in the past and the list has been
most helpful in offering advise. Thanks!

My new question is: How many miles can you get from a 944 engine without 
doing a rebuild ? (Assume average maintenance, I know YMMV :) 

I ask this because there is a '87 944 advertised w/ 130k miles for asking 
price 
$5,000. Sounds to good to be true! (Haven't seen it yet, it probably is :)


Also, I've gotten 944 average yearly maintenance costs estimates from list 
members in the $1,000 to $2,000 range. What would maintenance costs on a 
74-77 911S run me ? (I know about the 2.7 durability issue :)


As always thanks for any and all advise!

Naresh, I have an 84 944 with 79,000 miles on it. I purchased it in 1989 with 
32,000 miles and have spent the following on maintenance and repairs. All 
costs are in Canadian dollars.

front brake pads - $27
slave cylinder kit - $8
timing belt,pulley & labor - $200
cap & rotor - $100
tires - $400
tune up - $60
spark plugs - $10
alternator rebuild - $65
regular oil changes - $20
fan temp switch - $17

I do all my own work with the exception of tensioning the timing and balance 
shaft belts.
I also drive it in the winter (I know, I know) but the car always starts, has 
a great heater and shows no affects of road salt (I try to keep it clean). For 
my money I'ld be hard pressed to find a Japanese car that 
has been as trouble free as my 944. I understand in talking to Bruce Anderson, 
the technical editor of Excellence magazine, that a well maintained 944 engine 
should be good for up to 200,000 miles.

        There's something that shuts off the fuel on overrun on the earliest
cars (like yours), but the "decel valve" on later cars (at least 73+) was
for the exact opposite purpose.  It lets air bypass the closed throttle on
overrun.  It was discovered that shutting off the fuel on overrun actually
created *more* emissions instead of less!  Supposedly due to the air-cooled
nature of the beast.
        The 2.0 decel valves are adjustable--you get to pick how quickly
you want your engine to drop back to idle.  Not sure if the 1.7's are or
not, and I can't find anything on my 1.8's valve to adjust...

Nice artical, with good explainations, but as both an SCCA and PCA racer, I
have to take exception to your feelings on SCCA rules. I don't know of any
current class that requires a factory limited slip in SCCA, The various
GCR's and such all seem to indicate that any limited slip is ok. (with the
possible exception of showroom stock... actually by definition, showroom
stock must have factory items).

It is PCA (racing) that has a silly rule about limited slip diffs, saying a
factory diff is ok, but a non factory diff moves you up one class.

Now if you want to help me complain over a beer about the shamefull lack of
classes for Porsche in SCCA, I'll buy!

This is a matter of taste. 89 944 turbo wheels were anodized and once damaged
they are a bear to fix. You can have them re anodized to close to the
original, polished and clear coated to your taste, or polished and them
chromed, again to your taste. 
IMHO just polishing is a short term deal. They will look good for awhile but
soon go tatty on you.
Any method requires the removal of the original anodizing and this is not a
small job.

While I don't claim to be a chemist either, your owner's and shop manuals
make the most sense to me.  Sure distilled water is corrosive due to it's
lack of metal ions, but tap water has many things in it which are not really
harmful to your cooling system directly, they can (and often are) deposited
in the system.  

Think of boiling a pan of tap water dry, you get all the salts (metals)
deposited on the inside of the pan, and it requires a corrosive acid to
remove them (ie. vinegar).

Theoretically, deionized or distilled water will not contain these things to
be deposited, and instead, being corrosive, it should help pick up those same
salts (metals) from your cooling system.  This is why we flush and change
coolant periodically.

Antifreeze may (I don't know) have a specific chemistry to control this 
corrosive nature of distilled water (I strongly suspect this is the case).
Using distilled water with antifreeze prevents you from introducing anything
else which may be much more corrosive, and which the antifreeze is not designed
to control.

I was looking through the FAQ on 944s & Barry's recent post on 944s and was

First, what, if anything, is the difference between the 88 Turbo S and the 89
Turbo (besides the year and the S after Turbo ;-)?  From what I have read, they
both have the same 250hp engine.  What else (suspension, brakes, special
packages, etc) is different from 88 to 89?  Which year should I buy if given a
choice (all else being the same: mileage, maintenance, condition, etc.)?

Second, given the *small* number of these cars sold in the US, do I have a
chance in hell of finding one these two beauties?  What would be an appropriate
price range for a well maintained 88 Turbo S or 89 Turbo?

Barry or George: care to share any more of your knowledge on 944s?

If the details are as you present them here, with money and bill of sale
changing hands, you should proceed directly to the nearest lawyer having
no connection with either the dealer or the insurance company. I'll bet
that throwing a couple of hundred dollars at the problem will make it go

Subject: Aluminum engine blocks


hello,

I've been following the thread on distilled water/tap water in coolent 
and was just wondering if aluminum engines are coated with something to 
prevent oxidataion/corrosion? Isn't there Silicon is the Aluminum  and 
does this affect the degree of corrosion? Ok, I agree that this is a 
chemistry test and not about porsches but I am sure there are plenty of 
people out there who would like to know about this. 

my $0.03 worth.

Hi Peter,

In a message dated 95-06-09 16:33:36 EDT, you write:

There is really NO difference between an 88 Turbo S and an 89 Turbo. I quote
the Porsche brochure for the 89 944 Turbo

  "However impressive such a level of performance may be [talking about
original 944 turbo], last year [88] Porsche introduced an even higher
performance version of the 944 Turbo. Produced in a limited series of a 1000,
this automobile was derived directly from a racing version that competed in
the Porsche Turbo Cup series waged throughout Western Europe. For 1989 the
new 944 Turbo includes all performance chacteristics of the 944 Turbo S. It
features 30 BHP more power, significantly higher torque and improved
suspension, brakes wheels and tires..."

So all 89 944 Turbos are really Turbo S models. I would look for either one.
Buy the car that is in better condition, regardless of year.

One thing that surprised me when I was looking for my car was that I was able
to find plenty of cars for sale. Of course they were scattered around the US.
I actually found three of them withing an hours drive of my house, but the
owners all wanted about $3000 more than I was willing to pay. I eventually
found a suitable car in Florida (I live in NY), had it checked by a mechanic
(oddly enough, my local shop recommended a mechanic in the south), flew to
Atlanta, bought the car, and drove it back to NY). 

Of course when I took it to my shop for a PCA tech inspection, my mechanic
insisted that I replace the water pump and all belts before he would let me
drive it on the track, (about $1000) but that's another story...

If you look in Panorama, Excellence, Autoweek and Hemmings, you can find
plenty of the cars. Current prices range in the $17 -$22K range, depending on
condition. I also found a few at Porsche dealers. Any car bought from a
dealer (year 87+) includes a 1 year UNLIMITED mileage warranty. This might
make it worthwhile to buy a car from a dealer. I thought I save a LOT of
money buying from a private person.

Good luck in your search. These cars are fantastic, and are about the fastest
best handling cars you'll ever see. 

Let me know if you need more info.

The definitive answer can be found in the MY89 944 Turbo Technical Info
book from PCNA.  I have a copy but do not have it or its p/n handy.  The
differences were small.  At some point, they changed the brake calliper
piston sizes.  They also dropped the rear anti-sway from 16 to 14 mm.;
forget exactly when.

There are lots of both the MY88 and MY89 cars around, and lots for sale.
At the time, PCNA had overproduced them for the US market, and a large
number of them went for well below list price.

I would not worry about 88 vs 89 differences.  Find a nice clean one of
either year, and think about fine-tuning the package later if it becomes
terribly important to you.

Just so people don't get the wrong idea, if you buy an '87+ Porsche from an
authorized dealer, a 1-year warranty is AVAILABLE, at extra cost.  They aren't
included with the price of the car.

At least, mine wasn't, and I know of one other person who paid for theirs --

It sold today for $6,500, the guy got his first call at 7:30AM.  Does this

Subject: 944: paint & owner's manual



My '88 944 isn't quite mint:  There's a little spot on the front fascia
(down low) where somebody must have bumped a snowbank and the plastic 
flexed and a very small triangle of paint popped off.

The car is all original paint.  I feel reluctant to paint any panels and 
just try and touch this up.  With other brands of cars, I've been able to 
find a decent match (eventually) at automotive paint stores, but the only 
Porsche literature I have says that the paint is "special" and has a 
certain fade characteristic/etc. that has to be matched.  Is this special 
paint?  Will those characteristics be matched with brands like PPG or 
DuPont, or must I find a can of paint from across the Atlantic?


Also:  There was no owner's manual.  Kudos to the FAQ and its 
contributors; I had uncuccessfully tried everything short of a crowbar 
(jesting) to get that sunroof off and for many days I hung my head in 
shame - bested by its complexity!

I don't even have an address or phone of wherever I might get the manual 
from.  Any suggestions where I might get one?  Shoud I just go to the dealer
or is there and easier/cheaper way to get one?  Junkyard?  It's an '88 944.

Thanks.

Here's an autocrossers view of the silliness of the PCA rules.
In SCCA Solo-II Stock class, you can use ONLY the factory LSD with
no penalty, but ONLY if it came stock in your year and model.

In PCA's stock (production) class PCRs, you get penalty points even 
if it was stock. An aftermarket LSD (quaife) seems to be legal
with the same penalty points, but I'm not sure.
In SCCA street prepared, you can use any type of LSD
(except for the grateful dead type).

Subject: 914 Ground straps/rear caliper kits

Dave Darling mentioned spontaneous re-routing of the ground in the 
914 a couple of digests ago.  When this happened to me, it was the 
accelerator cable that was forced into service.  Not a good 
arrangement.  The cable is rather small (relatively), heated up and 
melted the casing causing the accelerator to sieze (fortunately, 
throttle *closed*).  If you find you have to push increasingly hard 
on your accelerator, check the ground strap. 
 
Someone else mentioned sub-standard rear caliper rebuild kits.  The 
story I heard several years ago was rebuild kits were not made 
available by the factory initially (as in "when the car was new") and 
so a 'substitute' was found in an effort to avoid buying new calipers 
every time one started to leak.  The 'substitute' was a VW kit.  The 
seals didn't fit well, but it was better than $400 per for some 
people.  The story has persisted, however, and some parts vendors 
maintain that 'appropriate' kits are unavailable. 
 
I have rebuilt a whole 4 (oooo, ahhhh) rear calipers using the kits 
from Automobile Atlanta and have never had a problem.  YMMV.

The kits sold now are ATE and a mixed bag of other vendors-but they actually
for a SAAB...NOT a 914.  The guys at UGI are extremely careful to handle only
the CORRECT part. The SAAB kit works ok but the seals are different in the
thousandths of mm in measurement and thus not an EXACT fit. Until recently
the Porsche/ATE kits were available, but for some reason the are NLA
temporarily. Most vendors latched on to the closest thing...a sale is a sale

will work in the long haul...after many heat cycles, etc etc....but I think
searching for the correct part is a worthwhile thing especially if its brake

Subject: 944/968 control arm replace

                      944/968 control arm replacements
I'm glad to see the PMNA acknowledges the problem with stock 944 control arms,
although their proposed part is expensive and not really a major improvement.
The following is an explanation of the 944 control arm failure problem based on
the information we've been able to gather. I prepared this to provide
information to 944/968 owners who have asked for a relatively concise
explanation of the problem, and who are concerned that they are in danger of
experiencing a failure.  Please feel free to distribute this to anyone who is interested.

The Sports Imports Racing replacement control arm prototypes have now been track
tested on two different cars, and destructive strength testing of one of the
prototype arms (in comparison to stock aluminum arms) will begin shortly. 
Volume production has begun and we expect arms to be available for both pre-87
and 87-on cars to be available from stock in approximately four weeks.  The arm
is fabricated from chrome-moly steel, is heat-treated, and has replaceable ball
joint bearings and studs, as well as spherical front pivot bearings and
adjustable rod-end swaybar mounts (with adapters available for both stock and
popular aftermarket swaybars).  The price is $650/arm.

Please contact Scott at 508 563-3848 to order, or myself (Nathan Ulrich) at 508
564-4995 for technical questions.

<< Begin enclosure >>


944 Front Control Arm Failure

Nathan Ulrich
Technical Director, Sports Imports Racing


A number of individuals have reported problems with failure of 944 front control
arms in track use. Since a control arm failure can have dramatic consequences in
high-speed driving, this problem has received a great deal of attention recently.
This explanation is the result of anecdotal evidence from individuals who have
experienced failures as well as technical analysis of the stock cast aluminum
control arm and two acceptable replacements, the Fabcar arm and the Sports
Imports Racing product.

The stock cast aluminum control arms exhibit two failures in track use:  first,
the arm fractures at the anti-roll bar mounting point; second, the ball joint
loosens in its mounting bore and/or fractures at the base of the stud.  Although
it is difficult to determine this conclusively, the parts in question seem to
fail primarily because of material fatigue rather than overload.

Both types of failure are much more likely on cars with stiff anti-roll bars and
stock or near-stock spring rates.  In this situation, nearly all of the roll
resistance is caused by the anti-roll bars, which puts very high loads on both
the mounting point and the ball joint stud.

The first type of failure occurs because the stock Porsche casting is marginal
in strength for cars with stiff anti-roll bars and stock springs. Voids or inclusions
in the casting, repeated high shock loading (such as hitting curbs or off-course
excursions), or simply many miles of service can eventually lead to failure.
Simply because of the geometry of the forces, the danger is exacerbated by
anti-roll bars which mount above the A-arm (for example, the ubiquitous Weltmeister
bars). The suggested Porsche Motorsport alloy control arm is not significantly
better than the stock arm in this failure mode.

The second type of failure, fracture of the ball joint stud, is not as easily
explained. Unlike some information has suggested, there is no evidence that wear
in the joint or cracking of the epoxy potting at the bottom of the ball joint is
necessarily a contributing factor to the failure, but rather is a further symptom
of control arms that have been highly stressed. There have been reports of
brand-new control arms exhibiting cracking of the epoxy. Again, very stiff
anti-roll bars with stock springs cause high forces at the ball joint studs,
which eventually can lead to failure. The little anecdotal evidence available
suggests it is a tension failure rather than a shear failure. Cars that have
been lowered can exhibit a geometry in hard cornering that maximizes tensile
stress on the inside ball joint, causing failure.

Because there is so much variation between the various 944 models, as well as
between each car which has aftermarket suspension parts, it is difficult to
accurately predict which cars are at the highest risk.  However, it is clear
that cars with stiffer aftermarket anti-roll bars are more likely to experience
control arm failure.  In addition, lowering these cars can significantly lower
the roll center, which increases the roll moment and can dramatically increase
the stress on the control arm and ball joint.  This is why IMSA has required
replacement of the stock control arms for the Firehawk (now Street Stock)
series, where cars are lowered, endurance raced on sticky tires, and driven aggressively.

Replacement of the stock control arms is recommended for cars that are modified
and are driven aggressively on the race track. There are currently four options
available. Some firms are adding reinforcement to the early (Rabbit-style) arms
and suggesting these as a replacement. These arms, in their original form, are
dangerously overstressed even in street use, but will usually bend rather than
break.  Adding sufficient reinforcment to make them safe for track use would be
very difficult, especially since they are formed of mild steel and cannot be
heat-treated.  In some cases, welding reinforcement to these arms may add stress
raisers or brittle weld areas, resulting in a control arm more dangerous than
the original part.

Dave Klym of Fabcar has been supplying replacement control arms for some time.
The Fabcar arms are simply a copy of the stock design in sheet steel. They are
approximately 50% stronger than the stock control arms, and, although there were
early problems with the design, seem to have worked well in Firehawk use.

Porsche Motorsport North America is offering a factory motorsport version of the
aluminum control arms which has an improved ball joint fixing.  Although this
should minimize the chances of a ball joint loosening and/or failing, it is only
a marginal improvement.  These arms are not significantly more resistant to
breakage at the anti-roll bar mounting point.

The Sports Imports Racing control arms are a proper engineering redesign, and
have been developed to handle the extreme loads experienced in professional
racing use. They are fabricated from tubular alloy steel, with plate
reinforcement and gusseting, are heat-treated and are approximately three times as
strong as the stock arms. Although originally designed only for racing use on
the SIR Porsche 944 Turbo race car, there has been sufficient interest from PCA
members that a small production run has been started and the control arms are
available for sale.


Sports Imports Racing was formed in 1993 as the racing division of Sports
Imports of Cape Cod, based in North Falmouth, Massachusetts. SIR has prepared
and raced 944s and 944 Turbos successfully in a variety of SCCA amateur and
professional racing series, winning two championships and setting two lap
records in the process. They currently campaign a car in IMSA's Exxon Supreme GT
series. Dr. Ulrich, SIR technical director, has been developing suspension and
chassis components for 944 series race cars since 1992.  In addition, he has
extensive experience in the field of mechanical design on projects ranging from
NASA space robots to consumer electronic imaging products.

Heh, heh, heh...  mine did the exact same thing on a trip from
Kaliforn-i-a to Wisconsin.  After a goodly amount of driving,
the starter would soak up heat from the engine and quit working.
After things cooled down, the starter would work fine.  The
relay kit is supposed to fix this.  In my case, I had a worn terminal
in the "start" position of the ignition switch and the wire from the
ignition to the starter solenoid was partially broken.

When this happens, a way to get going again in an emergency
is to set the parking brake, make *SURE* the transmission is in
neutral, turn the ignition switch to run, reach under the back end
with a screwdriver, and short the big terminal on the solenoid
(straight from the battery) to the solenoid terminal from the ignition
(the one on the right, I think).  This energizes the starter solenoid
directly from the battery.  Be very careful if you do this as you will
have your head and body under/behind the car when the engine
starts.

The best thing is to fix the problem so you don't have to do this, but
this trick has saved me a couple of times on long trips.

Subject: I am told it is totaled.

Help is needed to instruct my directions in an accident. I just bought a
1974 914 2.0 less than 30 days ago. It had been reconstructed from an
accident over 3 years ago and looked super else I would have not bought it.
The only thing I could see wrong with it was the battery tray was partially
missing. In other words, it was almost a perfect rust free 1974 2.0 with
Fuel Injection still intact except for the battery tray. No corrosion below
anywhere. All I did was replace the muffler. Beautiful Niverna Green without
a blemish. Original.
Now to my problem. I was driving to work. A huge truck with about a 40 foot
trailer jacknifed across the center line and hit me all along the drivers
side of the 914 with the major damage concentrated behind my seat and the
built in roll bar. The door was also heavily damaged. The firewall is broken
loose 3/4 ways across the width of the car with the engine lid standing at
about 30 degrees high on the drivers side. Windshield and back window
shattered.Oh yeah, the dash is buckled out to the left of the steering
wheel. Dash was perfect, but now split in straight lines in 2 places and
mirrors went south at crash time. The hood and truck are rolled just at
their  drivers side edge about 1 inch.
The driver admitted fault and I had him write on his business card to that
effect, sign and date it. I received no ticket. I was hurt in the lower
right side of my back, left shoulder and right leg. No injuries are visible.
Back is the only pain I am feeling now, 16 days later. No broken bones but
the damn pain is sure real. The Insurance Co. for the truck driver is
claiming that the 914 was totaled when the previous owner had it, but in
fact, it was reconstructed. I was titled and insured at the time of
accident. My quest for help is: Since it is again called a total loss, do I
have to accept what they offer? Can I demand that they replace it with 914
of similiar value? Can I demand it be reconstructed at their cost to its
condition prior to the accident? Anyone have any idea of the cost? (I am in
Memphis. Tn.) Do lawyers only do the injury claims and what about my 914?
What will you sell your 1974 914 2.0 with fuel injection for? Answers from
Stan Hanks or Dr. 914 appreciated although I did not want to bother anyone
who may not have the time to ponder on this.
Thanks in advance for all interested. You never know when it could happen to
you.
A 914 is not a car, it's a way of life. I have owned 14 since 1970.
Financial problems is the only reason I don't still have them all!

Subject: Stoddard swap meet!

Got to the meet around 11:00 a.m. today and saw some beautiful cars 
displayed.  Not too many vendors present, but a surprisingly large 
variety of parts.  Here's what I got for $60.00:

Pair of 2.0L heads (bare)
"after exchanger" bolt on header and muffler
914 fog light switch
Thwen's drivers side mirror

Not too bad, if I do say so myself.  I think that part of my fortune was 
due to the weather.  It looked like it was going to rain really hard 
(which it did) and some people didn't want to take much home with them.

Anybody interested in a caravan for next year's swap meet?  I'm 
definitely going again!

Subject: I got my 924.


Hi everybody,

I can now claim the rightful place on the list ... I went and bought
the 924 yesterday !

This is a crimson '82 924, with the obligatory cracked dash, obligatory
drivers seat cushion split :-) one obligatory minor dent when someone
backed into it years ago, and not much else amiss. The speedo was
broken, so I checked compression on the engine - all cylinders checked
about 150psi, which I gather from the archives on this list is pretty
good for 80K miles (estimated).

Not bad .. Esp. since this is my very first car ever, I am excited.
(have I said that enough times already :-)

My sincere thanx to Paul, Jay and Lee for their encouragement and
positive discussions related to my query.  Hey, I owe you guys a beer!
Also thanx to people responded with equal gusto to a thread some
year(s) ago - I recall it was "Sreelal's 924 .. which he thought was a
928" - thanx to the P-file list and archives I knew more about the car
than the guy I bought it from !

And now I continue my quest for that slightly elusive 924/VW/Audi
compatible parts list ... I have to prove myself one again that there
is indeed a P-car that is possible to maintain for $200-300 a year :-)
Oh, and to start saving for my upgrade to a 944 :-)

From: Mark Krieger <msk@unipress.com>
Subject: 914 transmission

Here's what happened to the Mark & Fred 914 last week and a few 
questions-- this is kinda long:

Fred was coming into the straight at Lime Rock, tried to shift gears, and 
found within a few minutes that he had only 3rd gear to choose from. He 
drove home -- 100+ miles -- in 3rd.

It was either (a) the transmission or (b) the linkage. 

We found out this morning that it was the linkage -- we're both very
happy: The car is running, and the real problem was a lot cheaper than a
new transmission. ($5 worth of nuts and bolts, *not* a new trans.) What
was the 'real' problem? The motor mounts, of course. 

When we started to jack the car up we both simultaneously noticed that
there was this loose crossbar attached to nothing. It was the motor
mounting bracket, with no bolt. (the other side was barely holding, I mean
barely.)Thanks to Keith for telling us what size nut and bolt to use, and
to Stan, Mark S. and Doug for advice. Yes we did bolt it back in
place...and when we tightened the other side that bolt (22 yrs old) broke
in half. We have two new nuts and bolts now, one on each side. With lock
washers too. The shifter bar sure works better without the motor mount
bracket sitting on it! And we drove the car, it works now... 

What's the moral of this story? Check *everything*. I thought we did, but 
we almost screwed up bigtime. If the other bolt falls out at 95 mph, what 
a mess.

And I have a few questions:

1. We have checked lot's of stuff out in this car, like the braking 
system, etc. We obviously missed the motor mounts. What else isn't 
obvious but should be checked. Our car has very very little rust and 
seems very sound, but what can anyone suggest. I drive the car every day 
and Fred tracks it, so we can usually notice when something is wrong, but 
what might we miss?

2. The rubber boot where the shifter bar attaches to the trannie had a 1/2
cup of trannie oil in it. This might be a 9 month buildup or be recent,
due to the shifter bar pulling so hard on the trannie where it is attached
and letting oil past the oil seal. Can this oil seal be renewed without
taking out the transmission? (We are changing the trannie oil on Monday)

3. The speedometer cable broke -- not in the cable itself -- but where it 
attaches to the trans. It looks like this attaches to the rear of the 
trans. and that the speedometer unit can be replaced by bolting a new 
unit into the transmission and into the cable on the other side. Is this 
correct? If so, what should this part cost? Does anyone have one of these 
they'd like to part with? (We own the porsche shop books for the 914, but 
I just cannot find the speedo unit in any of the books)

Thanks.

Mark -- Blue 914 2.0 1973 ---running again,yeah!

Bob:

I know enough to be aware that Panteras are MID-engine, not rear...

Seriously, though, there are a LOT of things to watch out for.  Buying 
performance cars (especially old, multiple-owner performance cars) is 
sorta risky, since most have been thrashed by their owners.  DEFINITELY 
join your local Pantera Club and learn all about the cars before you go 
out and spend... what are they going for now?  $20-25K or so?... on 
one.

My wife (yes, the same one who now owns that Toyota MR2 Turbo that 
caused such a furor here) briefly owned an early-70's Pantera... If you 
have any specific questions, I guess I could ask her.  All I know about 
them is that they MUST have the "cooling updates"; early Panteras 
apparently overheat pretty badly.  The "Hall mods", whatever they are, 
are also allegedly desirable.

Jim:

Disconnect your battery.

Find the wire from the ignition key that controls power to the CD or 
coil.  It's likely to be red, and it goes through the fuse box on its 
way to the CD/coil.

Remove it from the fuse block and connect it to one of the "z" 
terminals on the underside of the kill switch.  Add a wire from the 
other "z" terminal back to the fuse block.  You should now have the 
kill switch between the key and the fuse block, with the wire from the 
fuse block to the CD/coil undisturbed.

Find the cable that's between the positive terminal of your battery and 
the starter.  Remove it from the battery.  The kill switch has two 
large threaded terminals.  Connect the cable from the starter to the 
one on the same side as the wire that's going to the fuse block.  
Connect another wire from that terminal to the "w" terminal under the 
switch.

Buy a battery cable and connect it between the other threaded terminal 
on the kill switch and the positive terminal of the battery.

Finally, add a wire between the remaining "w" terminal and the 3-Ohm 
resistor that should have been included with your switch.  Connect the 
other end of the resistor to a good ground.

At this point, you should have:

    On one side:
    a wire from the key to the "z" terminal.
    A wire from the starter to the lareg threaded terminal.
    A wire from the large threaded terminal to the "w" terminal.

    On the other side:
    A wire from the CD/coil fuse to the "z" terminal.
    A wire from the positive terminal to the large threaded terminal.
    A wire from the "w" terminal, through the 3-Ohm resistor, to
    ground.

Voila.

    No.  Your message was a little vague on the "insurance company
    claims the car was totalled last time" point... If they're claiming
    that your car was worth nothing at the time of YOUR accident
    because it was once totalled and later salvaged and repaired, you
    may have a case.  If, on the other hand, they're offering something
    close to what a 21-year-old 914's usually worth (I'd guess around
    $1.-2K), there's not a lot you can do.

    It's probably not worthwhile to repair the car, but if the cost
    estimates you get from your favorite body shop are less than about
    150% of what the insurance company's offering, you may be able to
    get a reputable Porsche expert (maybe even the body-shop guy) to
    convince the insurance company that yours was a
    particularly-valuable 914, and so is worth more than the cost of
    repair.  This has worked for me in the past; I've been hit a couple
    of times, and my body shop has always managed to convince the
    at-fault drivers' insurance companies that $5K-or-so repairs on my
    914 were justifiable.

    On the other hand, my car's visibly different from most
    run-of-the-mill 914s.  It sounds as though yours is basically
    stock, which is going to make the task difficult.

    Good luck...

(Remember the joke about the difference between a porcupine and

impress. It's refreshing to find  Porsche has recognized their 
roots and dropped snobbery from the tone of their advertising 
and gotten back to the sheer joy of driving and hey, with a 
smile instead of smugness. And it's  great porschephiles has 
the sense of fraternity which makes the car even more special. 

So with this backdrop, back to this James Wood vs "The Heath" 
thing. I found James' questions (while causing me to wince at 
times) made out of a sincere desire to understand. Should "the

Guten tag,

Saturday June 10th, the Alabama Region PCA held a 
driver's ed event at Talledega Gran Prix Raceway
(near *the* Talledega).  Several pfiles were in attendance
despite the brutal heat/humidity.  I think this event
was run in conjunction with Weight Watchers - that's
how hot it was.

Darren Evans-Young continued his streak of bad luck (his
thermostat stuck closed at the last school-dang) when he was
suddenly unable to find *any* gear in his 944S.  He was
able to get thing working after sitting out a while and
bravely headed right back out onto the track.  The only
thing more brutal than the heat yesterday was Jon and
Nancy Lowe's 944 Turbo.  Ludicrously fast car.  Bryson
Beaulieu (sp? - sorry) was there in his white 928 (that
serves double duty as a support truck - he can really pack
alot of stuff in the back of that thing)!  Keith Roberts
made the trek from Atlanta in his beautiful 930.  Pfiles
Jim McCullers and Jack Criswell were also there, but sans
cars.  I wouldn't have been able to stand watching everyone
else.

I sacrificed all-out speed yesterday to work on my heel/toe
downshifting (yeah, that's my story and I'm sticking to it)
and treated everyone to a nice spin right in front of the pits
as a result.  I wasn't very pleased with my driving.  Sadly enough,
the most encouraging thing for me yesterday is that my 2.7
liter engine (with the 5-bladed fan, no less!!) never got over
230F in the heat of battle.  

Too much fun!!

Subject: 924S Incontinence

My '87 924S has been dribbling oil (Swepco 201) from the transaxle since I
bought it last November.  The transaxle was rebuilt (bearings and synchros)
early either late in '93 or early in '94.  I'm pretty sure less than 5000 miles
have been put on the rebuilt tranny.

Not wanting the car  to be piddling $50/gal Swepco on my floor, I had my P-mech
(who did the rebuild) take a look.  Input shaft seal was leaking.

Seal has been replaced, and after about 100 miles is again leaving spots on the
garage floor <grr>.  P-mech and I immediately hit on a possibility...  shaft
bent?  This is scary.

Even scarier...  could the main shaft of the transaxle be out of alignment
slightly?  Bearing problem??  Mechanic wouldn't be happy if I impugned his
rebuild as the cause of the leak...  am I off base here (I hope)?

Being a long-time lover of the marque, but a neophyte in ownership, is this a
common high mileage problem (114k... mostly hard miles, by my guess)?  What
would cause a bent driveshaft?

Could the Swepco be slippery enough to get out of the shaft seal?  I like it,
but would be glad to switch to conventional oil if the fix is that simple...

Any other ideas?

name "filtercharger."  Is there anyone with a semblance of a brain who 
believes that Madison Ave. hogwash???  I clearly understand that it may 
be a "low restriction" air filter, or at least "lower restriction" than a 
stock paper filter, but a "charging" effect and "straightening" of the 
intake air?  If that was true, I'd order a truckload of K&Ns and fasten 
them to the front of my 944 and be able to go 200 MPH due to the 
"charging" effect of the filter....hah hah hah!  How does the FTC let 
them get away with that claim?  What jury-rigged "test" have they based 
that claim on?  The only K&N I ever used was on a late-model Corvette - a 
flat-panel type element.  It was very thin and when I held it to the sun, 
I could see lots of little holes letting the sun shine through.  I would 
be concerned about its effectiveness if I lived in a dusty area.

#2!! "High performance" spark plug wires.  If your factory wires are in 
good condition and the motor is running great, how are larger diameter 
(or pretty colored) wires going to get you a lower 0-60 time as some 
vendors advertise?  If there's enough juice for you to pull to redline 
smoothly, what difference does it make?

#3!!  Split-fire plugs.  I've seen claims of "easiest 5HP gain there 
is."  I've had salesman try to vigorously push these on me (at some 
ridiculous price I can't remember) when I try to buy exhaust or intake 
parts that actually contribute to making HP.  I base my skepticism on the 
same reasoning that I question new plug wires.

I'm certainly no expert, but I still remember from "How to Hotrod VW 
Engines" (my 1st hot-rodding exp. and subsequent rebuilds) that 3 ways to 
increase HP are (1) getting more air/fuel mixture into engine, (2) 
getting the most out of what gets in (such as increased compression), and 
(3) reducing friction and pumping losses.

Obviously, most mods that produce significantly increased HP fit in the "#1" 
rule."  Plugs and wires would have to fit in the "#2 rule."  I don't know 
much about electricity or spark plugs, but my suspicions are that if 
getting proper voltage and spark was a problem, then ignition coils would 
still be as big-a-round as a coffee can - rather than the tiny things 
that sit inside the distributor cap on some models.  I just can't see the 
inadequacy to the stock parts or how the highly-touted replacements will gain a 
stock motor 5HP when I've run the piss out of all sorts of modified (and 
stock) cars all with stock ignition components and no problems.  Am I off 
base here?  Since I've never tried "split fire" plugs, I can not 
definitively say they are worthless, but I'd like to hear from someone 
who put them in and noticed increased performance.

Subject: 944 mtr mts and timing belt



I haven't had the time to crawl under my 944 since I've suspected the 
motor mounts were bad.  One of my curiosities when I first got the car 
was that the engine wasn't as smooth as I had anticipated for a Porsche.  
I was further surprised when I saw that the 944 has balance shafts, and 
it was still so rough!!!  Then I read the FAQ and now I am almost sure of 
what I need.  There was a place mentioned selling the mounts for $110 
each.  As mentioned, I haven't looked (yet) to how many there are, how to 
tell if they are all bad, etc.  How many are there?  How can I tell if 
they are bad?  I'm assuming that it is possible for the fluid to leak out 
and my untrained eye won't be able to tell.

I'm also paranoid about the timing/balance shaft belts.  I won't trust 
the car (and I won't even rev it high) until I get these replaced.  
However, I haven't been able to completely comprehend the procedure.  I 
bought a Haynes book on the 944, and it seems like they don't even want 
to get into it and recommend a dealer, then there's an engine rebuild 
section that (obviously) has to deal with it.  Seems contradictory.  
Somewhere I read that tension is a delicately-performed procedure, 
requiring special tools and expertise.  I believe it stated that if you 
"guess" at the tension then take it (slowly) to a dealer immediately, 
they can set the tension on a belt that you install.

Then I read somewhere else that the 1988 model (that's what I have) has 
an "automatic" tensioner??  Does this mean I can slap it on myself and 
not worry?  This car has about 38K miles on it now - I assume the belts 
have never been changed.  If these belts are good (typically) for 60K 
miles, then should I even worry about it now?  Any advice in this regard 
will be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Head Studs

I've just returned from a rather brutal encounter with my mechanic.  What was
going to be regular maintenance (valve adjustment) on my '78 911 has turned
into a top-end rebuild.  Leakdown was horrible:
1 - 10%
2 - 26%
3 - 100%
4 - 26%
5 - 6%
6 - 95%
Needless to say (but I'll say it anyway), it looks like about 2/3 of my
cylinders are in pretty rough shape.

At any rate, while he's doing all the valve magic, he's going to check the
tolerances of each piston and cylinder.  When everything is being put back
together, he'll install new Dilivar studs.  My question concerns Raceware
fasteners.  Has anyone had any experience with these and, if so, has it been
a pleasurable experience?  I do find their ads tempting.

Well, this is another one of those "it depends" cases...

If you're doing this in any state with CA style emissions laws, you're
already hosed -- you won't be able to register it as-is because you need
to comply with emission regs for the NEWER of the engine or the body year 
of manufacture, which means you'd need the DME back, *AND* a catalytic 
converter.

Let's assume that for the sake of argument that this is NOT the case, or
that you're building this as a not for street vehicle. In that case,
the single biggest improvement you can make is in the exhaust system.

There are several really good header systems for 914-6 conversions. 
You need to avoid the temptation to get really big diameter pipes,
though -- smaller pipes == higher velocity == better scavenge effect
in the header. And trust me, you're not going to be doing *ANYTHING* 
that can challenge the throughput of the smaller pipes. Big problem with
most of these is that they're designed as straight-pipe systems. You
can fit SuperTrapps to them, but again, remember to think small -- each
"half" of the engine is only a 1.6 liter, so you should use the smaller
SuperTrapp setup (one per side). The previous owner of my 914 racer made
that mistake, and as a result I had a very very hard time getting the 
car to run right -- I had an exhaust basicly designed for a 4.0 engine...

Other than that, there's *NOTHING* cheap that you can do. The next
stop is probably a programmable crankfire ignition system, like the
Electromotive. That adds some flexibility but not much power. For more
power, you'd into opening then engine up which you can't do on your
budget.

Good luck.

Now about your back. If it is hurting- get off it and lay down. See a doc

It sounds like what happened to my car a couple years ago is happening
to yours. Apparently, the lock/key system is sufficiently worn by
actuation over the years that they eventually don't work right
together. If the key will not physically turn in some or all of the
cylinders then I would guess this is what has happened. You will
probably need to have the car rekeyed if this is the case, but see if
you can find a really honest locksmith to have a look at it.

Okay, this I believe is part real, part crap. Part real: the lower the 
resistance, the better, the bettwer the RF shielding, the better... the 
pretty colors are for show engines. Part crap: even zero resistance 
wouldn't give you more power than a gnat slamming into your rear, why?

I just put these in an '85 Buick today... They were.. expensive, yes. BUT 
they did make the car run smoother, and they did remove that nasty top 
speed of 55 MPH (for how I shall never know)... I think that they are 
mostly hype, and considering that not all engines are the same, how can 
everyone get 5 more HP? (not EXACTLY what the box reads, but for the 
flaming purposes, it'll work) They are basically spark plugs with a 
little more spark... The spark isn't any hotter, So I'm not sure what the 
real advantage is, other than they are new...
(oh, BTW, the engine did run smoother and have a faster 0-60 time from 
what I could tell, but then, I don't have the time, equipment, or desire 
to test this car)
The thing about Split Fires is that just having them will make the 
average uninformed person go "ooh!"

guiding me. having an expert driver giving me constant
coaching was invaluable to me. fortunately, he wasn't afraid 
to let fly an almost constant blitz of admonitions and
comments. he managed to get through my "wall of adrenalin"
and my helmet. the primary goal, he urged, was to follow the 
correct "line" around the course. this enabled me to drive
through the turns at a maximum pace and use the whole track. 
gradually, by following his advice, my laps became smoother 
and faster. i knew i was doing something right as my
passenger became uncharacteristically quiet. there are fews 
delights greater than passing a car with 60% more hp than
you have. though i often pushed it to the redline, my
worries about pushing my "daily transportation" too far
 subsided, as my respect for porsches grew. afterwards, i

Meantime, those splitfire things make some sense. They spark along two

ignition unless the car was already igniting completely (due to proper
injector adjustment and in-cylinder vapor tumble/spin). It is unlikely
any of us have near-perfect fluid dynamics in our cylinders, so we can

to play a bit, my friend took it up to 110, but then stoped playing.  A 
short time later, the engine died at 85mphs.  My friend popped the clutch 
and got it started again.  We then cruised home between 75-80 MPH.  A

Subject: 944: Extra keyhole, alarm



James here again....neverending 944 questions.

Of course, I didn't get an owner's manual for the car and since
I'm traveling away for the summer leaving any day now, I'll have to
order one at my destination, so I'm without.

What the hell is that extra keyhole in the left rear fender of the car?
I strongly suspect it's an alarm, but I didn't see any results when playing
with it - which I am afraid to do intensively for fear of setting off a 
possible alarm.

On the subject of alarms:  I'd like to put one on this car.  Anybody else 
have an alarm on their 944?  It seems kind of cheesy to put on another 
alarm (over the factory) and end up with a bunch of redundant components, 
but many factory anti-theft measures are woefully inadequate.  I remember 
when the 1986 Corvette came out with "pass-key" antitheft measures, the 
theif would just bring along the "black box" computer from a 1985 
Corvette - break in and plug it into the wiring harness under the dash - 
and drive away in the car....ha ha ha!!!!

As always - your contributions to this 944 thread will grant you eternal 
salvation (or at least contribute thereof)!

Oh yeah -- I'd completely forgotten about that particular brand of crazy.
Shit like "oxygen free copper wiring" to prevent "audio distortion due
to pathyway impurities"... I used to be a closet audiophile until my
officemate in grad school (who had about a $20k stereo) decided to get
a CD player. I had a First Generation unit from Phillips, where the whole
transport slid out of the unit for changing the CD, and had just
replaced it with a newer Phillips, their first with just the sliding
CD tray, dual DACs, and 4x oversampling (this was like in '84 or so).
He wanted to buy this super-high end product that started life as my
Phillips unit but had all of the power supply, analog, and connector parts
replaced by "high end" "pure" components to the tune of about $1500.
So naturally, we had to arrange a blind A-B testing... *EVERYONE* in the
store picked mine as the high-end unit and on asking where I got it, rushed
right down to the discount shop where I'd paid $269 and cleaned them out.
Dave stubbornly insisted that the $1800 unit *HAD* to be better even if
he'd picked mine 4 out of 5 times. I sort of swore off the whole thing
after I saw him write that check...

Wrong. You get *ONE* spark path. At best, you get two chances for the
spark to form in case there's anything keeping the "primary" path
from forming. All of the tests I've seen indicate that there's not a
net difference that couldn't be matched by just replacing the plugs
with *NEW* conventional plugs of the correct heat range.

The SplitFire isn't even as good as the Bosch W225T7 plugs from the Dark 
Ages -- they at least had multiple different electrodes rather than this 
forked tounge thing... (Hmmmm.  Interesting to note how good a metaphor
that made...)

Not to mention real problems had by people I know that thought it might
at least be worth trying. Everything from "car ran like shit" to "blew
plug out of head, major damage".

Hats off to y'all for setting me straight on the splitfire thing.
I got one relatively flammacious personal reply from an AOL'er (heh

After the two following paragraphs of hifi-related crud I have a
question about the 928 hood, so skip to it if you know about that sort
of thing.

Stan: I *have* a stock CDB650. I once put it head to head against an
Accuphase CD player, wired through a Cello passive attenuator,
Levinson line-level crossover, Levinson low-end and Counterpoint dual
mono mid/high, into Beveridge electrostatic tower + subwoofer, with
cabling worth more than the average Porsche. The owner "[thought he]
might hear more depth and ambience in the Accuphase." We are not
amused :-).

I have every intention of keeping my li'l Magnavox spinning into the
next century. I've never heard a more neutral, quiet, clean reproducer
of PCM.

928 question: the hood on my car is not flush on the left or the
right. It's slightly above on the left and below on the right, with
the skew slightly more pronounced toward the front. What can I adjust
to fix this?

Subject: High-performance hype

According to what I learned in school (some 10 years ago, excuse me for bad 
memory), when the voltage is high enough on one electrode to overcome the 
resistance (i.e. number of electrons gets high enough) they'll take the 
shortest way over to the opposite end (the one with least resistance), until 
both ends are counterbalanced. Conclusion:

The spark will _not_ be split between the two ends of the electrode, but 
use only one of them. Exeption is if both ways are equal in resistance 
which would be virtually impossible.  So, where am I getting it all wrong, or 
does this prove they're bulls** t?
As I see it, best would be to have the thinnest electrodes possible, but 
still be able to pump up the voltage high before releasing a spark. 

More spark plugs:
I used to have really expensive Bosch WR7DS (silver) in my 944, but switched 
to regular NGK BPR6ES (copper). Result: performance exactly the 
same... Made lots of acc. tests before and after, no difference.

Hi ,

I've got a special case for the sunroof. It's some kind of leather 
bag which you zip around the roof. It still needs to go in the trunk 
but at least it prevents scratches. (the zipper *will* scratch 
it if you don't take care :0) ) I think it's a standard item that 
comes with the car so you probably can get one at your local 
dealership for lotsa $$$.

Hope this helps,

Hi,

>From the Owner's Manual of my '82 924, I learnt about the O2 sensor
wire, and that got my attention up. To an avid electroniker, this spelt
opportunity of combining an old hobby with a new preoccupation.

Found a thread on fuel injections in the P-file archive -
>From stan Mon Jun 22 08:12:40 1992 >Subject: EFI follow-up

One thought, instead of just putting a resistor in the signal wire of
the O2 sensor (which I can understand wont work too well), I am
thinking I can insert a variable transconductance op-amp, (whose gain
is close to 1, but is adjusted by something.)

What I am thinking of doing is to sense a COMBINATION of low gear (esp
gear #2) AND high accelaration, (typically the face-off scenario) - and
under that situation alone diddle the lambda to run a richer 1:12.4
gas/air ratio than the usual lambda = 1.0 (1:14.5).

My knowledge of automobile fuel injection is just 2 days old, so I may
be a bit naive, but the above seems reasonable to me. Should give just
a bit more oomph on the 0-60, without hurting emissions.

BTW, what lambda is 1:12.4 ? (got to get me the Bosch book).

Of course, the next step is to couple a GPS reciever to a uP diddling
the CIS - switch modes from city-mode to highway-mode to face-off-mode,
depending on lat/longitude and tacho/speedo :-) :-)

James,
I can only try to answer one of your questions;  the K&N filter.
K&N claims that their filters straighten the air-now if this is true, 
there should be an increase in intake air flow.  Most intake systems 
aren't the optimum shape a create turbulence at the inlet that the air 
has to fight to get into the engine.  K&N filters don't charge, just aid 
flow.  And if you'll remember from fluid mechanics, a bell shaped inlet 
is the choice for optimum flow i.e. velocity stacks on Webber carbs.  
This all goes back to your explanation of more intake flow/fuel=more 
horsepower.  As for me, I don't know if they work but they sure have 
built themselves quite a reputation (good).

We've been through this before, there is no way you will actually
get 2 sparks from this or any plug.  Otherwise why don't you
just build a plug with 47 leads coming off it and ignite the leanest
mixture you can think of?  A spark is current getting through the
air between 2 points with a high voltage difference.  The spark will
occur betwween the 2 points with have the lowest resistance at the
instant of time when it occurs.  The spark ionizes the air in its
path, which reduces that air's resistance, so that the whole spark
will choose that same path.  So you only have ONE spark.  And the
strength is not any different for a normal plug or tor the splitfire plug.
What it could do, having a probably larger area for the electrode,
is that when an area becomes fouled, spark will happen from another
area, thus having a longer life (if all other thiings are equal,
which may or may not be).

Subject: RE:  How does my 944 cooling system work?

Armagn-

You do not have a problem  - the cooling system is working as designed.

Under normal driving conditions, the coolant temperature will rise until
the fan switch activates, which turns on the electric cooling fan.  This
cools the radiator, and thereby the coolant, until the fan switch opens
(at a considerably lower temperature) and shuts off the fan.  Then the 
temperature will begin to climb again.  In traffic on a warm day, it is
perfectly normal for the system to cycle between two temperatures as the
fan comes on and goes off - this means everything is working right.

When you turn on the AC, a second, high speed cooling fan comes on.  This
fan is somewhat overpowered, and will have no problem keeping the engine 
temperature at the low side of the gauge, even in traffic.  It also runs
for a short while after the AC is turned off.  So with the AC on, you will
not see the cycling that you do without it, unless it is an extremely
hot day.

Jim,

Your problems with the central door locking feature will be extremely hard to
troubleshoot without an electrical schematic diagram. In addition to the
control switch (with the button on the console), there is a logic module
which resides under the cowling, accessible from the front trunk, an
electrical switch in each door, and an electrical solenoid in each door which
does the locking.   The logic module contains bunch of diodes and other
electronic components, as well as a a couple of relays which control the door
solenoids.

In lieu of having the factory manual wiring diagram, there is a publication
by Mitchell which you may be able to find at some larger libraries which has
Porsche wiring diagrams that include those for the door locks.

Hope this helps.

Tim,

I don't have direct experience with the Raceware stuff, but from their ads,
know they have both rod bolts and head studs available for the 911 engine.
 If I'm not mistaken, Bruce Anderson has had some experience with them and
rather than tell you what he said to me about them which I interpreted as
positive, perhaps you should email him if he hasn't already responded to your
question.

I know that the fasteners are quite expensive, but then, so will your
rebuild, and if they are as bullet proof as the ads indicate, might be good
insurance.  The main problem with the dilavar studs is long term
susceptibility to corrosion-related stress cracks, which is probably the root
of your leakdown figures.  The latest dilavar studs were epoxy coated to help
mitigate the corrosion problems.  I don't know how the Raceware fasteners
will fare in this area.

Nothing about Porsches, but I had to put my 2 cents about the CD
players.

The reason that the older Magnavox CD players sounds so good is that
the chip sets in them are the classic SAA7220 Digital Filter and the
TDA1541Dual 16 bit DAC from Phillips which are considered as one of
the best of the multi-bit chips.  It was even used in other players such as
the older Rotel 855.

WRONG!

 The spark will not work any harder than it has to. That means that as the
voltage across the electrodes increases, it will arc as soon as it can,
across the lowest resistance path. In a car ignition then starts
immediately. in a TV commercial, the ionized air will present a lower
resistance path, but as the ionized air moves around and is heated, the
path will distort and "dance" resulting in many paths becoming the lowest
energy path over extended periods of time. The flame front in a car spreads
away from the electrode at the speed of sound in the air/fuel mixture, and
will be long gone before the second electrode gets around to doing anything
useful. The likelyhood of both electrodes arcing simultaneously would
require truly identical conditions, including gap, electrode surface
condition, and path resistance. How likely is that?

Ever see a jacobsen's ladder? Thats the old frankenstein movie special
effect where two wires are arranged vertically and have a larger separation
at the top than at the bottom. As the voltage is cranked up, an arc starts
at the bottom, and runs up the "ladder". Have we learned why?

Flame off.

I have to apply this comment to the world of Porsche audio.  While Bart
has a good point in the fact of "drive for the sake of driving," I still
like my tunes (ala "Iron Eagles" movie).  I've gone through all of that
promotional crap and even had a competition system installed in an older
Jetta.  Phooey - once you're rolling at '70 with the revs hitting 5K in
third, all that performance audio sounds like so much static.  The judges
should be forced to check the sound under REAL conditions. 

I've since smartened up.  Both of my 914's have $98 pull out Craig units 
(built in 25 wats RMS per side) and a pair of Radio Shack Minimus 7's 
behind the seats.  Total package deal: $210 per car and I can hear it 
fine even with the top off at the posted speed limit of 55mph (yea, 
right).

When a crook looks in a spots a Craig in the dash, I'm surprised that they 
don't leave me a sympathy note (or someone else's Alpine!).

Subject: Re: How does 944 cooling sys. work? 

Hi Armagan,

My experience with the later model cars is that, all things being OK,
the coolant temp will pretty much stay put on the lower white gauge mark.
It may come off a little bit if you are running the AC or stuck in
city traffic on a hot day.

Porsche updated the radiator fan switch, to memory, in Feb '88.  That
would make the fans come on at a slightly lower temp.  It will not
change behaviour in highway driving, though.

The later cars have a three-contact fan switch, controlling the two
fans.  If you run the AC, the high-speed fan is also automatically
switched on (I believe).

Most common problem with cars that won't stay cool in the coolant is
insufficient bleeding of air from the coolant.  Particularly with the
sixteen-valve heads, it sometimes take a little driving to move air
through the head to the point to which it can be bled.

Hi James,

The only way to really check the motor mount is with a C-shaped gauge,
which you can make from stiff wire or flat stock.  Porsche described
this "locally made" tool in a tech bulletin some years ago, and I would
be happy to send you instructions.

You cannot accurately eyeball it, and because of the part's location
and surroundings, you cannot hold a ruler up to the mount.

Regarding the belt tension, the MY87 and forward cars have an automatic
tensioner on the cam belt.  However, a couple of caveats.  First is that
the tensioner can go soft or otherwise fail.  Second is that despite the
tensioner, Porsche had belt slap problems with the 944S2 and recommended
use nonetheless of the gauge.  Third, you still need to measure the
balance shaft belt tension.  (They also call out gauge values for the
PS and alternator belts).  Finally, if you are reinstalling an old cam 
belt, say because you just did the water pump, you need to use the
gauge to "index" the tensioner so to get the lower belt tension (2.7?)
called out for broken-in belts.

And, for all of you 911 owners chuckling at this 944 foible, get this:
Last December Porsche issued a tech bulletin prescribing the need to
measure the 911's fan belt tension with a new tool!

When this happened to my 944, I just got one of those Locktite rear-view mirror
adhesive kits.  First, take a marker or grease pencil and, on the outside of
the windshield, mark where the adhesive is.  This is so you'll know where the
mirror should be attached.  Then, take a razor blade and scrape the old adhesive
away.  Then, remove the little metal insert from the rear-view mirror.  Scrape
all the old adhesive off of that, too.  Then just follow the directions given

twenty minutes, then reattached my mirror.  I did this about three months ago,
and haven't had any problems.

Hi All,

Thanks to those of you who responded to my 901 xmission questions.
I found a 901 tranny at the Stoddard swapmeet for $100 which I 
could shift into all gears by hand.  I'll use this as a temporary
trans and rebuild my original this winter.  I hope $100 isnt too
bad a price, it seemed fair at the time....

Got lots of goodies this year, weather played a important factor for me!

1.  Got 3 boxes full of "stuff" from a '67 912 for $5
2.  Jack for $5
3.  Really "cool" fat/bullet like mirrors which I think are
	hard to find.  $25/pair, and they are perfect!
4.  901 5speed Tranny $100
5.  5spd shift knob (new in Stoddard's parts tables) $5
6.  Early tail light rear lenses pair for $20 and they are in great shape!
7.  After it started raining, people put cardboard boxes in front of
	their table and yelled "free box!" and the chucked "stuff"
	into the box.  Got a whole bunch of stuff, dont even know
	what it all is, but, a lot of it is 356 stuff.

My buddy got a pair of nearly new Recarro seats so he can autox for $500,
he was excited that it was a fair price.  Another person had a 911 wood
steering wheel for $1000, boy am I glad I got mine last year
for $50 and I just have to refinish it! Lots of wheels, but,
outrageous prices - many were just plain junk.  I saw one wheel
with 6oz of lead on it and he wanted $150 for it!

All in all, not bad!  Weather cut our time short, but, a good shopping
spree just the same.  The Toyota 4Runner was packed!

See ya at Tweeks (7/16) in Indianapolis!

Just for a note, according to the EPA, the average car has an 
inefficiency (that's what this all is about, getting the most out of 
everything) in the area of unburnt gas of .003%, so out of every l litre 
of gas, you burning all but less than one drop.

I've installed a 3.0 SC engine and 915 tranny in my 914.  I'm using the
Patrick Motorsports cable shifter too.  I don't know if I can recommend
it or not....shifting my car is difficult right now compared to the 914
tranny I had in it last time the car ran.  It could be due to a few things:

 - Cable shifter design (not likely...those are HUGE cables!)
 - Fresh tranny rebuild (definite possibility - should get better)
 - Pennzoil gear lube - not Swepco (will change this ASAP)
 - Short shift lever and throw (3.5"!) - not enough leverage (definitely)
 - I'm not used to the new shifter and new tranny (definitely)

My main complaint is I have to "muscle" the shifts....it takes a
lot of force to move the lever in and out of gears.  Not good for
autox where quick shifting is necessary.

Another problem with this setup is the cables are a little too long.
Finding a good cable routing is hard.

I believe the Renegade Hybrid guys have their own cable shifter - you
may want to talk to them for more info about their setup.....or you
could go the Vellios side-shift conversion route...more money, but
more "factory".

As I weed out the issues listed above, I can give a more accurate
recommendation.

>Given the weight of the 914, I hope that this engine combination would
>give it a good power to weight ratio and make it a quick 914.

It will.....I know 2 local guys who have the 3.2/915 combo in their cars.
One guy is running GT2 track events, and the other is the current
DM autox champ in our area.  Both of these guys have Vellios
side-shift conversion kits - 1 guy likes it, the other has had a
few problems.

>I also plan to upgrade the brakes to the 911 brakes.

Good.

I've got a bunch of info I'm compiling into a 914-6 conversion FAQ

got to figure out.

>I plan to take this car on the track and would also be grateful for

What % of use is it going to see (and how important is each area
to be "correct"):

Street_______%
Autox________%
Track________%

This is VERY important if you'd like a good recommendation from
the very experienced P-philes on this list.

Considering your other message about a $3000 cap on modifying
the engine, I have to ask if you've thought of all the things you'll
need in order to get this project going.  It WILL be expensive.
Here are the areas I've modified from the stock 914-4 in order
to get my 3.0/915 combo installed:

911 struts/brakes/master cylinder
rear stub axles/CV's
stiffer rear shocks/springs
wheels/tires/flares
motor mount
tranny mount
muffler mount
914-6 engine sheet metal
shifting mechanism
oil tank and lines
interior gauges (oil pressure/temp, tach,speedo)
throttle linkage
clutch linkage
modify 915 tranny for mid-engined use (includes speedo pickup
    for street use)
headers/muffler(s) (cable shifting needs dual mufflers - this area
    is critical for good performance - I'm still gathering info)
wiring harness changes

Each area listed above has its own headaches and problems
you've got to decide how to solve.  A lot of it depends on what
you're using in another area.  For example, don't go out and buy
a motor mount from company "A" and a tranny mount from
company "B"....they may not line up.  There are also ground
clearance issues with a "Quick-6" motor mount....some
companies make short ones, and others make tall ones.
Of course, ground clearance problems really become
apparent with low profile 15" tires.....which is what I have.
3" of ground clearance underneath my motor mount isn't
what I'd call a "good" thing - especially when a speed
bump is in front of you and a growing lineup of cars
behind you.  :-)

Your carbed 3.2L has its own issues too....smog check,
throttle response, recurving the distributor....

I'll try and get my FAQ done ASAP.

Hello Brake Experts:

What is the benefit of having very big brakes on a car? My car is an 89 944
Turbo. In 89, Porsche made three different 944 models, all with ABS. Each car
had different brakes. The standard 944 had single piston brakes, the S2 and
Turbo had 4 piston, with the Turbo brakes being larger, from the 928 S4.

Since the regular 944 brakes were powerful enough to lock the font wheels,
what is the benefit of having the larger rotors / calipers? Is it to
dissipate heat better, so that the brakes continue to work under extreme
(track) conditions? If so, would the addition of a cool brake duct kit make
the regular 944 brakes as good as the Turbo?

Subject:      944 Clutch


Had some problems with my 944S this weekend at drivers ed.
Perhaps someone can shed some light on what's wrong.

While going around the track, it would not go into gear.
I pulled into the pits and the car would not go into any
gear.  It would go into gear with the engine off. I started
the car in 1st with clutch pushed in. It bucked a bit against
the parking brake, then quit bucking. From that point on, it
went into any gear easily.  I did my track time and everything
was fine. However:

1) when I let the clutch out in neutral, it makes
   a loud clack noise that it never made before.

2) I get engine vibrations at certain RPMs, (1400, 2800)
   The steering wheel does not vibrate at all. Just the
   engine (visibly) and the shifter. Dont think it's MM.

3) When driving and I let off the gas, there is a clunk feeling.
   And again when you hit the gas. It used to be a smooth transition
   from acceleration to coast and vice versa. The car goes into
   gear just fine. It just feels like there is some play somewhere
   there shouldn't be.

I suspect a clutch problem, but I'm not sure. One theory is the
slave cylinder. It has never been bled before (since I've had the
car for 1 year).  As for the engine vibrations, I checked the balance
belt and shafts. They are in time, belt is ok.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: re: Pressure Washers -- tearing your skin off

I remember my dad telling me a story about a guy at work who
was using a pressure washer to clean out a bucket he had been
using for a painting project.

Seems the stream from the pressure washer hit the bottom of the
bucket where there was still a little paint hanging around,
and a jet of water/paint reflected back up off the bottom of
the bucket and drilled a nice little tunnel of paint and water
right into his index finger.

The guy didn't think much of it 'til he went to the doctor
because it hurt a little.  The doctor *immediately* operated
to get the paint out, and then had the guy keep the finger
elevated for weeks, with the threat of losing his finger
if he didn't.

Moral of the story: BE CAREFUL with a pressure washer.
Wear all the protective stuff they tell you to.

Tim,

Surely you suspected something a little more amiss than the
adjustment of your valves?  Regular maintenance?  I would
guess that leakdown numbers of 100 & 95% would be highly
noticable??  If the car wasn't running *that* badly before

I would guess that your rubber center of your clutch disk has let go.

That would explain the clunking (metal stops hitting) and the vibration 
(chunks of 
rubber have been torn out of an otherwise balanced assembly) and the "would 
not go into any gear (chunks of rubber jammed into the works, preventing 
normal clutch release)        

Probably not the slave cylinder (it does not explain the vibration or the 
clunking).

Just a clarification on the below opinion of Gleason differentials
_____________________________________________________________________________

The Quaiffe is a licensed version of the Gleason-Torsen torque sensing
differential. It uses a complex interwoven planetary gear setup to send
power to the wheel best able to use that power. It does not have a lockup
mode. The Gleason-Torsen is *WIDELY* used in high-power four-wheel drive
applications, as it is nearly indestructable, can transmit tons of power,
and is *NOT* a maintenence item.

____________________________________________________________________________

        I installed a Gleason in my Jeep (AMC20 rear diff.) a few years
back.  The unit worked very well in that it transferred torque much better a
Spicer Positraction (disk type), and was less harsh than a Detroit Locker.
However, the Gleason only lasted about a year!  I'll admit to abusing it in
two ways.  First, in "Jeepin" we do some pretty tortuous things at very slow
speed.  Climbing over boulders with two alternate wheels in the air, where
you simply would go *NO WHERE* without "lockers".  Second, the Gleason unit
specified a maximum tire diameter of about 28" for my application.  I used
33" tires, so was applying more torque than specified.  Anyway, the "barber
pole" hears in my Gleason galled, turning the gear lube into something
approximating metallic metal-flake paint.  It started acting funny one day.
I returned home immediatly and pulled the Gleason out shortly before
catastrophic failure (saving the R&P, etc.)

        The Gleason works fine in a high speed/low torque (relative to
boulder crawling) applications.  However, due to numerous failures in the
application I described, Gleason stopped making units for aftermarket
off-road applications.  I was unable to obtain rebuild parts for my unit,
which could be very nice in a less extreme application.

I don't think that the camber will cause the car to wiggle what the negative
camber will do is make the car handle better. When you turn the tire will
roll under the car with more negative camber the tire will still roll but
the roll will cause the tire to place a bigger contact patch on the pavement.

Toe in or tow it out of adj with cause wiggle. The major cause of wiggle is
out of round tires, out of balance tires, and lose wheel bearigs.

Subject: SC brake problems while racing

Posting question for a friend because I don't have an answer to his question:

Stock 911SC which has new slotted rotors front and rear, using Cool Carbon
pads. Outside front pads had at least 60% material left after a weekend at
Watkins Glen with a very skilled driver ( fast). Inside pads on both front
sides completely gone. 
Rears were fine with equal wear. Pistons were properly orientated with proper
gauge.
The slotting had the trailing edge pointing backwards on the outside of the
rotors and forward on the inside. Same with the back. 
I always thought that the slotting should be facing away from the rotation
but it didn't seem to make any difference on the back, just the front. Cool
brakes were used and there are no other variables that we could come up with.
Net wisdom would be appreciated.

Subject: Re: camber, was 911SC wiggles, was 911 shocks

I don't think it's a matter of zero camber versus -1.5.  Zero camber
may be the official factory street setting, but many of us are driving
with negative camber without any wiggles.  It sounds more like unequal
toe-in.  

Dwight Mitchell, for example, has a competition alignment that calls
for aggressive camber, but no toe-in in front. 

An improperly lowered car will bump-steer; that may be the problem
here as well.  From what I've known and experienced, I'm pretty sure
your situation is not a result of negative camber alone.

Negative camber is the norm in competition settings because,
presumably, the car will lean in cornering and a negatively cambered
wheel will have more tire surface on the ground in those conditions.
Conversely, a zero camber will have you more on the edges.

FWIW, IMHO, and all that.  Hope this helps.

When I opened (for inspection and cleaning) the MFI

the four bolts surrounding the idle adjustment screw
were not screwed down tightly.  If you've been inside
one of these things, you'll know why I say it is not
obvious that they should be screwed tight.  They are
odd shaped bolts that sort of 'hang onto' cylindrical
pieces that press against a series of springs.  Can't
make it any clearer than that.  This is a case where
one picture is worth...

Is there someone out there who knows whether they should
be snugged up?  I did it, so it's too late to go back
to where they were, so please tell me I did the right thing.

BTW, this is the second one of these 23 year old pumps

with solvent to remove old oil residue, there have been
no visible signs of wear.

collant mixing...ouch!).  So I need a new ride.  I don't want to rush 
into a purchase of the next Porsche I see, so I have two possibilites, on 
which I have placed a $1000 ceiling.

1.  Get a rebuilt engine droppeed into my Celica for about $1000, in a 
shop that only installs rebuilt motors (I'm wondering if they are reputable?)

2.  By a beater car for about a grand, a VW rabbit (it is German)  or 
something along those lines?

I know what has been done on my  Celica, and if it will run ok after the 
new (rebuilt) engine, I will be happy.  But if the new engine will lead 
to other problems...

I post this message here because I trust and respect the opinions that 
have been given in the past...

THanks,

Tim

Hi Scot,

This is inaccurate.  In fact, you want laminar flow up until the charge
enters the cylinder head, or close to it.  It's the most efficient way
to move air.

You do want turbulence past a certain point because it does a better job
of mixing the air and fuel.  Hence "swirl" designs in ports, for example.
There are also considerations given to controlling flame front propagation
within the combustion chamber: with an off-centre spark plug, you want
to use assymetric air flow quality to control flame front propagation in
the chamber and so even it out.

A good source of info on this sort of thing is David Vizzard's book,
titled something like "Theory and Practice of Cylinder Head Modification."

Subject: 951 S Power "loss"

I am getting closer to realizing my ultimate dream of auto-exotica. I 
just purchased an '89 951S, gaurds red, black leather, the works. I have 
notice, however, that sometimes upon accelerating the car does exactlly 
what I would expect (and love); snap my neck when the turbo reaches its 
power-band. This sudden rush of acceleration is what its all about in my 
opinion. Other times, though, when accelerating the same way, and 
stepping on it at the the same RPM level as before I feel nothing. The 
car still picks up speed quickly, but there is no turbo "rush" and I 
don't get that kick in the seat like usual. Instead it accelreates like 
a V8 hot-rod (of the domestic type).

Has any ever experienced this difference? What was the cause, and more 
importantly, how much did it cost to fix? 

Also, My idle has starting surging when the car is cold and when the A/C 
is on. What is the fix? I know BMW's and Audi's were known for this and 
a service bulletin was issued to replace the idle valve and control unit 
free of charge. Does Porsche have anything like this? Where can I get 
information on Porsche service bulletins?

OK, enough questions for now. Thanks to anyone who can help me out.

Thanks

Before you beef up an engine that already will just about triple the
HP over a stock 914, what about the rest of the car?
Have you already modified the chassis and suspension to take the
200+ HP of the new engine? If not, you will have an ill-handling, even
dangerous car. The normal 914-6 mods include chassis stiffening with
weld in brackets (a full suspension-console mounted roll cage would
be even better), 911 front suspension/brakes, 911 (or if you can find
them, 914-6) rear brakes, and heavier springs, torsion bars, and
sway bars.

I haven't done this yet, but I am seriously considering a 914-6

Subject: What color to paint?  Your .02 wanted!


Now that I've got my car running and its gone a few hundred miles without a 
serious breakdown, I'm ready to start thinking about painting it.  I've been 
going back and forth about what color to choose and I figured why not put it 
out to this group?

I'll post the results and let you all know the "top 10 colors to paint a 
porsche."

Here the info:  The car is a '69 912.  It's totally stock (no flares, etc.) 
 The interior is black.  The original color was this ...unique... shade I 
call "wacky '60's green" -- I think if I painted it that color I'd have to 
buy a matching nehru jacket and wraparound sunglasses.  Anyway, the green is 
not one of my top choices.  It was later painted burgundy which has faded to 
the color of an old wine stain on a cheap carpet.

Keep in mind also that this car does not have a/c and I live in LA, which 
brings up concerns about painting it black.  (Also, one of my friends told 
me that a black porsche would be "too LA.")

So, tell me what color YOU think I should paint it and why.  I'll let you 
all know the results.

Thanks.

Subject: Re:  Hirschman automatik antennae

I took mine apart a couple of years ago - if I saved any information,
it's at home, and I'm at work now. So I don't remember the colors
of the leads. But it's pretty simple inside. There should be ground
on one lead, +12 all the time on another. The third lead switches
between +12 (radio on) and either ground or open (radio off). The
third lead controls a relay, which reverses the polarity of the dc
to the drive motor, and also determines which of two limit switch
positions (fully up or fully down) the voltage to the drive motor
goes through. The limit switch is kind of cute - takes about five
turns to go from one stop to the other. In my case, the relay was
hanging up - a bit of filing and a drop of oil fixed it. It still
doesn't always retract 100% unless I keep the mast lubricated a bit.

It appears to me that you can't do any harm by briefly applying +12
to two of the three leads and ground to the other. The worst that
could happen is that you would have the wrong match between drive
direction and limit switch - obviously a bad long-term match, but
not harmful for a few seconds. Or you could just go ahead and take
it apart; it's an imperfectly sealed unit in a very wet location
and could probably use some cleaning up anyway.

Ujjal-

Before you do anything, get a crayon, and mark the perimeter of the adhesive
footprint on the windshield on the OUTSIDE of the glass (so that after you
clean off the inside, you will be able to put the mirror back in the right
spot).

No get a "Mirror Remount Kit" from your friendly auto parts store.  This 
kit has two vials of chemicals, and should cost around $3.

Clean the inside of the glass by using a razor blade to scrape off the 
remaining glue, then use pure alcohol to remove any oil or residue on 
the inside of the window.  

Examine your mirror, and carefully remove the mounting button from the
mirror arm.  Now follow the directions on the remount kit to glue the
button back to the window.  After it is set, remount the mirror on the 
button.

Don't worry if you don't get it exactly right, because you will be doing
it again in 6-12 months.  So far I've done mine 5 or 6 times, and it always
comes off again.  I suspect that UV light degrades the cement that they
use.

I have heard that there is a double sided tape that can be used on the 
85 1/2 and up models, but don't know anything more about it.  If anyone
has a better or more permanent method I'd love to hear about it.

Ujjal,
I am a recent mirror replacement survivor, so let me give you my 
experience.  There's rear mirror adhesive made by Loc-tite which includes 
a solvent and the adhesive.  There are good directions on the back of the 
package.  One thing I learned though (after the mirror fell off the first 
time I used this stuff):  Do NOT be conservative on the application of 
the adhesive to the back of the mounting plate.  I did the "one drop" in 
the center and when the mirror later fell off I dicovered the "one drop" 
had only sread out to about half the full diameter of the mounting 
plate.  Lesson:  Make that "one drop" of adhesive a BIG one (yes, there 
may be a little mess around the base of the mirror, but at least the 
mirror stays stuck!)  To get the old adhesive off the windshield AND the 
back of the mounting plate (don't forget this!) just use a razor blade.

Subject: Porsche limited used car warranty

For what it's worth:

I bought my 1986 944 Turbo two years ago and received the factory warranty.
 (Incidentally the warrenty is for all cars from model year 1986 on)

The program had been in affect all of one month.  The warranty was included
in the price of the car at apparently(!) no cost to me.  It came in handy
because I had the air conditioner compressor (a cozy $1000 part) replaced for
free.

I have heard from other fanatics who have since purchased their cars at this
dealer that a) they did not receive a warranty and/or b)  it was offered at
an additional cost.

Perhaps the dealer wisened up after a couple months under the new warranty
and was trying to take advantage of un-knowing customers?  

It helped me out at any rate.  I wonder how it is "really" supposed to work
and would be curious to hear from others who received/did not receive the
warranty.

YES! If you actually use those brakes they eventually "go away". The fluid
boils, or the rotors warp, etc. If you are going to start up the
modification spiral, the cool ducts are a good investment, as they can be
used with virtually any brake set up. In general the brakes were upgraded
by the factory as the cars got heavier. The factory pads also reflect a
different design philosophy: the factory would prefer you warp the rotors,
BEFORE boiling the fluid, so the pads are more thermally insulating than
some of the available track versions.

The 86 951 was an exception. It was WAY underdesigned from the beginning.
If you're worried about cooking the brakes on the track, you can attach a
thermocouple gauge to the brake pad and monitor the temperature while
driving.

was sent a postcard inviting me to bring my 86 911 Carrera in to Town North
Porsche and Mazda in Richardson TX (Dallas) for a free Porsche Service Clinic
(the postcard came from PCNA in Reno).

I took my car in last Saturday afternoon expecting that I would
be getting an estimate for $$$$ money. The head Porsche mechanic test drove
the car and than put it up on a rack to check it over. He than brought me
into the garage to go over what he found. To my supprise, the work he
recommended was the following:

  1. Repack and adjust the front wheel bearings.
  2. Repack the CV joints on the half-shafts.
  3. Weld new rear sway bar mounts on.

I have been needing to get item #3 done for a long while, but have not
taken the time since I had removed the sway bar after I found one mount
broken. Items #1 and #2 were expected with the age of the car.

I made a comment about how small the estimate was and he said he wish he could
find more things to fix, but that was all it needed. The mechanic also told me
that my car was one of the best he had seen in a long time. He said that people
had brought some cars in that had been so abused, that they were unsafe to
drive. He also looked up my options using the sticker under the front hood
and told me that the car came loaded, except for limited slip. He also gave
me a coupon for a discount on all parts and labor good until the fall.

Even though I do my own maintainance, I feel much better about this shop and
will use them for anything that is beyound my know how. I hope this gives

Subject: PNW PCA tour report

On Saturday I took part in my first PCA event: a 300 mile tour of the Olympic
peninsula in western Washington. We met at 9:00 just south of Seattle, went
south to Tacoma, west to Gig Harbor, and then took a beautiful winding route,
with a couple of stops for coffee and B.S., north to Port Townsend, where we
arrived at about 2:30.

We had about 18 cars -- mostly 911s, ranging from '74 to '89, plus three 944s
and an extremely menacing-looking black '89 928. Our route included travel on
I-5, where our caravan was quite the gawk target, and highway 101, the lovely
and curvaceous coast-hugging path along the Pacific, where we had to deal
with the occasional Winnebago. Despite these slight inconveniences we made
good time and I had occasion to discover that my magnetic-mount CB antenna
does stay firmly affixed at 100 mph, despite the manufacturer's only
assurance being that it would stick "at legal highway speeds."

The scenery was gorgeous, even in the cloudy weather, and it was an
incredible high to be screaming around the curves in the middle of a pack of
beautiful, roaring Porsches. We made a stop at Dosewallips national park,
where our arrival and departure drew scores of onlookers out of their damp
tents.

On the return trip I cut out early and took the Kingston ferry to Edmonds,
then drove home to Seattle. While waiting for the ferry to arrive, two people
stopped by the car to ask if I'd been with the pack and ask what it was all
about. I gleefully took the opportunity to proseletyze for Porsche and PCA!

As was suggested by other list members, I purchased a CB radio before the
trip and found that it greatly enhanced the experience. If you've never done
a tour like this with your local PCA club, I highly recommend catching the
next one -- you'll have an absolute blast.

I'm sporting MAJOR wood in anticipation of the next tour! Wahoo!

Subject: Splitfires and Hirschmann Antennas



Hi all,

Splitfire spark plugs, as a few people have already posted, are basically
snake oil. The only advantage, as a few posters noted is the additional
area exposed to the center electrode under very high load conditions, 
noteably midrange acceleration. Other spark plug types offer similar 
characteristics from the use of noble metals, which take longer to break 
down in these conditions.

All spark plugs should be indexed to expose the open area of the electrode
to the top of the piston, assuring a minimally shrouded spark and ignited 
mixture to expand and propagate correctly. The angled spark plug holes in
914 2.0 heads allow a better mixture burn than the stock 1.7/1.8 straight 
plug heads because the angle and indexing will provide better combustion 
and scavenging as the exhaust valve opens. 

The new Splitfires yield a little more torque and a few HP in the midrange 
area. But so do the Bosch Silver plugs. 


Hirschmann electric antennas.
The wiring is thus: Black is ground, Red is + battery 
power, on at all times, white is actuation voltage (+) from the radio. To
test, connect the power leads to a 12V power source, observing polarity. 
Touch the white lead to the power and the relay should trip and the antenna 
extend. Remove power, the antenna should retract. Occasionally the relay 
opens, it is on a printed circuit board and can be replaced with a Radio 
Shack replacement unit. 

If the internal mechanisim corrodes, toss the unit. You can't get parts unless 
you have a few laying around.  There are replacements that work exactly the 
same and will fit in the original location for less than $70. There is nothing
magic about a Hirschmann except the price. I addapted the mechanisim of a 
replacement to fit a Hirschmann case for a concours car. 

If the antenna mast is sticking as it extends or retracts, a little WD-40 to 
free the mast segments can be sprayed at the junctures. If the mast is broken, 
replacements are available from car radio shops that sell Hirschmanns.

Do not loose any of the fender mounting hardware for your 924/944 as the 
angle pieces are special. If you buy a used unit, make sure it works before 
you pay for it. Most shops do not allow returns on electrical components.

Just a brief report about the Karcher Global Endurance GT Series that
has grown very popular here in Europe.

I just got a glimpse of the results last night from the last race
and noticed that there where Porsche's (GT2's) on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 
5th and 6th positions. This in competition with McLarens (that usually
wins), Jaguars, Venturis, Ferraris etc. The Porsches have much less
horsepower than the McLarens so its quite interesting to see these
results. I unfortunately missed the race so I don't know what happened
to all the McLarens. 

Many of these cars will be at LeMans but the next race in the series
is at Anderstorp, Sweden, 2nd of July.

Subject: 911 Test drive fatalities


Three people were killed during a 911 test drive in
the UK. A potential customer and a salesman were
on a test drive in a 911 Tiptronic when it collided
head on with a Renault 5.

The Porsche driver and passenger and the driver of the Renault 
all died as a result of injuries sustained in the crash or the 
ensuing fire.

Police were unable to say who had been driving the
Porsche because the nature of the accident means that dental
records need to be traced to identify the casualties.

Police said speed may have played a factor in the accident.
Porsche UK said that it checked that customers were experienced
drivers for test drives, and that it was their policy for
the customer and salesman to adhere strictly to speed limits during 
demos.

This is the second fatality during a sports car demo in 
recent months. A Ferrari test drive in April concluded when
the customer crashed and burned after loosing control
of the vehicle.

The article in "The Independent" of  13th June 1995 from which I draw 
these facts was commendably neutral. rather than a "BAN these
Killer Kars NOW!" headline, with a picture of a 935 on a racetrack
cartwheeling into the barriers or similar, the article was restricted
to the facts. It included quotes from The MD of Porsche GB who
stated that the 911 was a very safe car, particularly in terms of
the handling and braking performance, as well as a quote from the 
spokesman for the British Safety Council who called for a code of 
practice to provide guidelines for promotional driving of
high performance motor cars. 

I am not sure what the guidelines would contain except for
the fairly intuitive direction that driving outside of
your performance envelope in an unfamiliar motor car might
result in crashing and burning. Having said that, there does seem
be a problem with customers who screw up big time on a test drive.
I wonder how many people are killed in test drive situations in 
motor cars other than Porsche or Ferrari, and simply don't get 
reported in the newspapers because it does not make a good
splash in the headlines?

Cheers

As the anniversary of my involvement with the Porsche marque approaches,
I've been putting the finishing touches on the chassis that will accept
my rebuilt power train.  

After I finish with the electricals, only the brakes and wheels/tires
will need to be done before the engine install.  I'm getting close to
see countless hours and about $6,000 fall into place and take my sunflower
yellow roadster for it's first drive.  I can hardly wait.

Now, I just traced out an evil gremlin in the electricals and am testing
circuits before I re-wire the front end.  I have a few questions for those
of you who know 914s:

a) headlamp wiring:  there are three wires and no numbers on the connector.
   Could someone let me know how they are oriented to the connector?  It'll
   save me the trouble of trying 6 different permutatios. 

b) What is a good source for dash lights and other bulbs?  Imparts?


c) Are the driving lights wired to only engage when the headlamps are 
   already on? [ It appears that way from the diagram. ]

Thanks much,

No, but you're taking a big chance on getting stranded somewhere...probably

Subject: Hirschmann power antennas

I've been following this thread with interest.  I also need to
take mine apart and fix or clean the motor unit, but I've got
a more basic question than the ones being asked and answered
so far:  how do you get it off the car?  I've found the bolt
underneath the motor unit and know what to do with that, but
it's only half the story.

My theory is that I need to remove some part of the stuff that
shows on the outside (top) of the fender.  There's a little
screw fitting with flats on it right under the bead at the
tip of the mast in fully retracted position.  I tried unscrewing
that a few turns and it does unscrew, but it doesn't appear
to be freeing up the unit.  So I guess that is just part of
the mast itself.

The only other thing I can see above the fender that looks 
like it might unscrew is circular, as viewed from above.
It is about 16mm in diameter and has two slots in it on
opposite sides.  My theory is that I need some kind of
special tool to unscrew this doohickey.  I checked all my
catalogs and the h/w store and can't find it.  I can draw
a picture of what I want, but the h/w store person said this
is probably a special tool from the antenna manufacturer.

Of course, I could just do the old "screwdriver as chisel"
scenario and tap it with a hammer.  But I've got a sinking
feeling that my reward for trying that would be some nice
gouges in my fender.

Can anyone enlighten me on how to do this?

Thanks for any guidance.

2.  By a beater car for about a grand, a VW rabbit (it is German)  or 
something along those lines?

I know what has been done on my  Celica, and if it will run ok after the

Neil Halvey

That was probably for an early RX-7.  The later RX-7s had the ground
electrode as a ring around the positive tip.   This I believe increased the
size or area of the spark to increase the probability of ignition.  Some
Nippondenso have a "U" shaped groove to manipulate the shape of the
spark as well.  The Split Fires is just another chapter of the same story. 
They just market it like crazy.  People who do not understand the basics
of the IC engine are the must susceptible.   They would probably buy the
gasoline pill, too.  The people at Mazda used knowledge from their racing
program.  So the answer is YES.  Its just that there are other spark plugs
that will do the same.  The differences will be the shape or area of the
spark and the material of the electrodes (this contributes to life
expectancy; ie the Platinum Bosches)

(to conserve bandwith) It needs basically an Oxygen sensor, an OP-AMP (Operat-

bolts and wire. Plus it could also be manually tuned by the driver on the fly.
All that is actually modified on the fuelk system is a clever modification
to the warm up regulator. (The thing that controls fuel pressure, and thus
the Mixture on CIS...)   Anyone interested email me direct for faster response

    I've seen the splitfire thread for a while and nowe i want to put in my
$.02.   Whoever said that the spark goes along two paths is wrong, but
thats not the purpose of the plug. The split in the electrode is for the
FLAME FRONT (no pun intended) When the mix ignites it fires through the split 
going straight down to the piston the outward. (more effective combustion) 
Where as a conventional plug has a flame front that comes out sideways
and hits the walls first creating a less fierce and lower power "bang"
As for all the claims on power. I never really noticed a difference. But what
did change was idle. The splits' ran with a smoother idle and seemed to last
a hell of a lot longer in my nissan which had tended to run rich. I haven't 
been able to try them in my 924 though.  But if you're interested in the 924 
bit. Excellence wrote an article on spilts in a 924. And i believe that they
came up with a zero difference in accelleration and in mileage.

Well thats my 2 bits....

Actually, they stole this one from a Bosch plug last made in about '62,
the W225T7.

Again, nothing new here: more electrodes means more chances that the
plug won't foul. But note that the ShitFire has *ONE* electrode, with
a forked tongue. Must be from marketing...

BTW, you can get the same "ring electrode" plug mentioned from Bosch as
well as NGK. The Bosch unit was apparently developed for NASCAR, according

  In particular, I noticed a center insert that
  protrudes maybe 1/8" beyond the threads into 
  the oil pan. What's that for?

On my 944 (and, I imagine, on the 928) that is a magnetic pickup.  It'll grab
and hold any small pieces of (ferrous) metal that might find their way into the
oil pan.  You should check and clean it every time you change the oil.  On my

Hi Timothy,

   I have done both of the suggested courses of action, with mixed results.
I put a used engine into an '80 Datsun 210 for a total outlay of $140.
The result of that was that I had a rustbucket that ran great. It still
does, you can have it for $700 if you want, and I have since fixed most
of the rust. Compression is 184-186psi on all cylinders, power is good and
the rest of the drivetrain is fine. Good brakes too. Also I bought an '80
BMW 320i for $1000 last year. I have put about $200 in parts (waterpump,
rear shoes, front pads & rotors) onto it, and will proceed with rust chasing
this summer. No, it's not for sale. My general feelings about the two
alternatives is that they are quite evenly matched, but there would be no
comparison if I had paid someone else to do the work instead of doing it
myself. The Bimmer would win hands down in that case - the Datsun would have
been a write-off. Moral: never pay someone to work on a beater, particularly
one that is easy to work on yourself. The other moral: don't waste your money,

What a beautibul Mornin!
I walked out this morn, the air was clean, crisp, and there was a fresh smell 
in the air.  Decided right away to pull the sunroof out of my 924 for the 
mornin commute.  Cranked up the engine - love that sound!- and started my 40+ 
mile commute into Ann Arbor over some of the best country roads Michigan has to 
offer a porsche.  (they made em that way just for me)

Once up to the main ave. I spied a white Mustang 5.0 tooling along at above the 
posted - so since my ride is white, and for NO other reason - I proceeded to 
catch up. Having my speedo buried in no time, (damn 924's only say 85) we had a 
wonderful time makin it to the next town - best time i've done in a while.

Keepin a sharp eye in the rearview just in case. All that I saw was a new kelly 
green dodge ram tryin to keep up - doin a damn good job, if I must say so too!

When I finally got to my fav coffee hole, the dodge pulled in behind me, as I 
proceeded to exit my ride for that cup-o-joe I noticed the gentleman in the 
dodge ram and said "HI! nice mornin, Nice truck!".  He said good morning also 
and. . .  "Nice car!" with a big grin.

I held open the door for him, and as I proceeded to get my coffee, he hit the 
doughnut counter.

Just a lovely mornin I thought as the man in the uniform, a deep blue uniform -
with a badge and all the fancy riggin on - left the store -

"Youall have a great drive home now - yahere"

P.S.
You 914 owners seem to commune well together, as well as you 911, and 944 
owners.  I consider myself fortunate to count a few 914/944 owners as friends, 
even been under the hoods fixin em, but no acquaintences drivin 924's. Anyone 
in the area -Ann Arbor - want to carry on some dialog?

I want to thank you all for your input about my clutch.
The concensus is that my rubber center is toast.

I've already figured out which banks to rob to pay for it.
What I would like to know is do these things disintegrate
because of driving on the track?  What would a spring center

Subject: Porsche Autocross information - Part 6 : TIRES!

Hi,

I have been asked to submit my columns on autocrossing Porsches
to the archives. Here is the sixth of nine(?) columns. Please let
me know if there are any mistakes or omissions, or other questions
that I should answer. I am editing and submitting them one at a time,
and will upload the whole thing after final editing.

There have been several requests for permission to use this material
in PCA newsletters, etc. Please ask before using it, but basically
any PCA use will be granted if the author is noted. If not too
difficult, I would like a copy of the publication with my material.



	Three-Wheeling by Mike Piera Part 6 of ?

	Setting up a Porsche for stock class autocrossing

	Of all the modifications that can be made to make a killer
stock class autocrosser, tires give the greatest improvement over
factory equipment. Street tires are designed with tread life
as one of the top priorities, whereas autocross tires are
designed strictly for performance. There are only a few special
purpose street-legal autocross tires on the market : BFG Comp TA R-1,
Yokohama A008 RS-II, and Hoosier Autocrosser. Nearly all serious
autocrossers use one of these tires. There are a few newcomers who
make very soft performance tires such as Toyo which may be 
competitive. Goodyear and Bridgestone make good tires for road
racing, but they do not currently have autocross-specific tires. 

	In '94 the BFG tire was available in two versions, 
Competition (230) and autocrossing (226) but the 226 was discontinued
in '95 as the 230 seemed fast enough. The 230 was designed mostly for
road racing, but is also good for autocrossing, especially long 
courses or pro-solos where your tires get warm. The Yokohama is also
available in a road racing version (RS) and autocross (RS-II). Even
the Hoosier has a road-racing version, called the Street TD. The
difference between the two versions of these three brands is
basically the tread compound. The autocross version is generally
softer and designed to work best at lower temperatures (there is no
warm-up lap in autocrossing). The tradeoff of the autocross tires'
great performance is that they wear out much faster. For occasional
autocrossers, or those who also want to use their competition tires
on the track, the road racing compound can be used for autocrossing. 
These include the Goodyear, Bridgestone, Toyo, and Hoosier street TD.
The road racing tire will be slightly slower on most autocross courses.
In 1995, the BFG 230 "competition" tire is still winning most classes
in the big events, so may be the best compromize.

	The Hoosier is in a class by itself because it is a bias-ply
tire, not a radial. The handling characteristics are quite different,
and the Hoosier was not legal in SCCA stock classes even though it
was "street-legal", until 1995. In general terms, the Hoosier is not
as quick to respond to driver input, but will not lose traction as 
quickly as the radials. The bias ply tires work with a greater slip
angle than the radials. This means you must drive with more effort,
and allow the car to slide more than on radials. You can drive as
much with your feet as with your hands. This suits some driving styles
better than others. Tire pressures are lower and tire roll-over is
greater than radials. Hoosiers are generally better suited to cars 
with a higher level of modification than a stock class car. These
tires can be faster than radials, but they are an aquired taste. If
you are serious, try a set and see for yourself. Hoosier is also
making a radial street-legal autocross tire, but it probably will
not be legal until 1996. This tire has a super-aggressive tread
pattern, almost a slick! There are only one or two grooves.

	The BFG R1 has a very stiff inner sidewall and a tread 
pattern similar in concept to the Yokohama, with an outer tread
area which will become a slick after use or shaving. The outside edge
is very square, but does not roll over even at very low pressures.
These tires work well at lower pressures than previous autocross
tires. Try pressures in the low 30's or lower. Pressures are a
personal choice depending on your car setup and driving style, there	
is really no "ideal" pressure. A higher pressure will give quicker
response, but a lower pressure may give more cornering speed
in a constant corner. For the truly serious competitor who
needs immediate performance, tires should be shaved on a tire
truing machine. New full-tread autocross tires handle poorly until
they are worn in. The Hoosiers are an exception and work well
after a few "scrub-in" runs. The BFG may actually last longer if
shaved due to less "scalloping" of the outer area, and less uneven
wear to the middle block, which causes the tread groove to wear to
the cord while the rest of the tire is still fine. The 230 is
better than the 226 in this respect (maybe why the 226 was dropped).

	After selecting a tire, the size must be chosen. Basically you
want the lowest profile tire in the widest size that will fit on your
rim properly. Also consider the rules, as PCA parade rules have silly
minimum circumference rules. I was able to get around the PCA rules
and still run a 50 series tire by squeezing a 225/50/15 on my 6"
rims in '91 (not recommended, but it worked!). For '94 I got a set
of 7" rims for the 225/50/15. This was legal, while my normal
205/50/15 on 6" rims were not. A standard 911/944 7" rim will fit on 
the front of most 911's, but a pre-78 911 may need the 911R offset to 
fit 7" rims on the rear. Revolution makes a wheel for this application. 

	Before spending lots of money on new tires, make sure you
have the widest rim that is legal for the class you are running. 
Also a smaller diameter rim is better because it will effectively
change your final drive ratio and lower the car if a smaller diameter
tire can be used. For example, several Porsche models such as the 911 SC,
Carrera, and 944 can choose between 15" and 16" rims. The 15" rim with 
50 series tires would be the best choice unless the width is less. A 
911 Carrera with 7" and 8" wide 15" wheels with 50 series tires will be
faster than 16" tires of the same width in an autocross.

	Here are some common Porsche rim sizes and tires. For the 914,
the 5 1/2" x 15" forged Fuchs alloy is best, with 195 or 205/50/15
tires. The 195 will really help acceleration and lower the car,
although the 205 has been more popular. Even with my heavier and
much more powerful 911S on 6" wide rims, I had one of my best events
ever on 195/50/15 Yokohamas, giving Roger Johnson's Corvette one of
his few losses at a Pro-Solo. For the early 911 or other Porsches
with 6" x 15" rims, the 205/50/15 is probably best. This tire will
also work very well on a 7" wide rim if a 225/50/15 tire will not
fit under the car's fenders (an early 911 with 7" wide rear rims).
The 225/50 fits well on 7" and 8" rims. But on a powerful 911, 
245/50/15 tires will work great on the 8" rears. These recommendations
generally apply to 16" rims also, but 45 series tires are available 
which are even better. In 17 inch rims, the new BFG 235/40/17 is
great for the narrow 7" fronts on late model 911s. The tire 
companies have "recommended rim widths" for their tires which will 
also help, and they can tell you what sizes successful 
autocrossers are currently using. The BFG tires seem to work OK
on narrower rims than you would think, so if you are stuck with 
narrow rims they may help.
	
	The Yokohama tires can be ordered from most tire dealers. Call
Kevin Rogers at Yokohama in California at (800) 423-4544 X-3862 for
technical questions. BFG tires are ordered direct from Team T/A,
although there are a few "team T/A" dealers who can get them for you.
Call (800) RACE BFG to join team TA. You will get their informative
newsletter and can find out how to order tires.

Pressure plate and t/o bearing: you don't, you replace them as a matter
of practice.  The belleville washer-style spring fingers on the PP
get tired.

On the flywheel, look for signs of gouging.  Absent them, it is probably
fine.  If you want to be very careful and correct, have the surface
milled flat and have it balanced.  There is probably a run-out spec
but I don't have it handy.

Subject: RE:Want my Title...

Please understand that I am not trying to defend the actions of the dealer in
withholding your title, but from your description "something smells fishy".
 Until you identify the chain of ownership and custody of the vehicle in your
possession you won't find out the real problem in withholding title and
precluding registration.

You indicate the car was in possession of an insurance company.  Did the car
have a salvage title at that time?  Was there a lienholder on the original
title (DMV should be able to tell you)?  Was an additional lien recorded (or
a mechanics lien established) as a result of repair or other event that put
the car in possession of the insurance company?  Did the dealer assert at the
time of your purchase and payment that they were the legal owner or were they
merely acting on your behalf as a agent in negotiations with the insurance
company?  Does the bill of sale you received (or a conditional sales
contract) indicated the form was approved by the Department of Motor Vehicles
in the State of Purchase?  Does the document indicate liability or exclusion
from liability on any liens, documented on title or otherwise?  You really
need to find these things out (I would presume the lawyer you have would
already have done that).

The bottom line (in my view) is that if the dealer clearly asserted ownership
at the time of your agreement and payment to them, they committed fraud by
offering a vehicle for sale for which they did not have clear title.  Your
state's attorney should be able to initate fraud action against them (include
a copy to your state's dealer association).  If one the other hand the dealer
merely acted as a purchasing agent on your behalf with the insurance company,
you may have a problem.  You mentioned repossession.  If the dealer incurred
additional costs (towing, storage, etc) associated with repossession, then
they could in turn expect to pass these costs on to you as the ultimate buyer
if they were acting only as your agent.  The clue here is that the DMV
apparently recognized the dealer as the legitimate owner by issuing the title
to them somewhere in the process.  You or your attorney need to find out why.

Le Mans.

BTW, since we're on the subject of trivia, I have found a few more
pointers to what we (and Pano) called the 924 GTP Le Mans in messages
posted a few weeks back.  It seems that the factory called it a
944 GTP Le Mans (944 vs. 924).  One of the pointers I came across was,
of all places, in the liner notes of the "Porsche Sounds" LP which
was put out in the mid-eighties.

To the p-filers
I am looking for some technical input, and I'll need it real soon.  
I have a friend with an 84-85 (don't know which) carrera targa that he bought
new.  the car has slightly more than 100k showing on the odo.  He came to me
the other day complaining about the "assist spring" going away...
Before we get to the actual problem; Let me give you guys a little
background...Since we live out in the middle of nowhere, I have taken it upon
myself to help the other Porsche owners in this immediate area however I can,
before any real shops get called in.   Trying to get a p-car fixed locally is
a huge pain in the ass and general waste of time/money.
Going to any good, Porsche-oriented shop from here is at least a four hour
road trip-needless to say, it's a good idea to have a firm grip on whatever
the problem is beforehand.  So, I try to help...Besides the necessity
factor-this is actually a lot of fun for me.   
Now, having said that, let me point out that I'm not exactly a pro mechanic,
far from it-I learn as I go along.  But I am comfortable with the basics (I
have a fairly well-equipped garage...) and I think I can generally save the
other local p-car owners time, money and grief by simply being a nice guy and
helping out...
Now-"the problem"
The driver has said that his spring assist (for the clutch) has gone away. As
I write this-I have not actually looked the car over yet (hence your
suggestions and advise are solicited beforehand)  
My immediate thought was the pedal cluster-is this valid? 
do the pedal clusters on these later cars have a similar spring layout like on
the early 911/912s and 914s?
Is there another spring layout that I can get to on these later transaxles?  
Is this serviceable without splitting engine and transaxle?  
Would it be worth it to take the engine out? (if so, might as well change the
whole clutch while we in there right?)
could this problem stem from any other linkage areas? (Like the transaxle
coupling?)
Whatever input, advise, comments, suggestions any of you may have is highly
welcome. 
Thanks in advance!

A magnetic field gets weaker as you move away from the source. maybe if you

It would stick to the plate in my head, or I'd have one on right now.

In general, if you find yourself saying " Doesn't seem like it could hurt,

I bit the bullet and this weekend bought one of

clean and degrease my current project.  It really
was a big help, and I'm sorry I didn't do this 
years ago.  What used to take a half dozen applications
of Gunk and vigorous hosing--sometimes more--took only
one or two.

As others advised, it's not the kind of tool you'd use
to clean a large concrete driveway, for example, because
the size of the spray pattern isn't that large, whereas
the more expensive units offer the needed wider spray.  But
for engines, transmissions and an annual deck washing,
it seems just fine.

I look at the mating surface where the throw out bearing meets the

Subject: Paint Codes


I am thinking about getting my car repainted.  The color code
on the door jamb says that the color is "L 96 B".  Which is
supposed to be "Alaska Blue", and I like the color.

The first shop I talked to; I told him that I wanted the car
painted "Porsche L 96 B".  He said that he would have to see
the car so he could match the paint.

Am I crazy, or can I expect to be able to say: "Paint the 
car Porsche L 96 B", and have the person be able to find
the right color of paint?

Gary.

Maybe this my own little soap box subject, but I think this
kinda sums it up.  I strongly feel that a Porsche owner cannot
truly experience everything his/her car has to offer without
going to the track.  The 4WD club I am in requires that every
prospective club member go on at least one trail ride before
being allowed to join - maybe PCA should require that owners
attend one driver's ed/autocross etc?  ;>)

I am a relative novice (5 events) when it comes to track events,
but I can safely say that my driving skills have increased orders
of magnitude.  But nevermind that, ITS FUN!!  I don't play golf, but 
I think braking at the end of a straight, turning in, clipping the 
apex and powering out of the turn (and getting it perfect) must 
be like hitting the ball really well - it just feels good.

Well, I'm about to start rambling, now....sorry,

Subject: 951 Control Arms -- Failures without lowering susp

Hi all,

Are control arm failures on 951s common even if the car has not been lowered?  
A local dealer, who decided to give me a free check up while the car was in 
the shop,  informed me that my 1988 951 has a loose control arm on the driver 
side.  A second opinion from a reputable independent shop (where my car is 
usually serviced) confirmed the diagnosis.  Both tell me that it is time for a 
replacement.  

What troubles me is that the car has only 35,000 miles and has been tracked 
only once.  Also, the control arm is loose only on the driver side.  The 
passenger side control arm is fine.  My regular mechanic also noted that 
*recently* he has had to replace  the *driver side * control arms of several 
other 951s, all of which were not lowered!!  He hasn't seen much on the 
passenger side control arm.  So much for all the attention that have been 
devoted to 944/951 track cars that have been lowered.

Have any of you experienced similar failures (defects?)?  I certainly didn't 
believe it when I first heard it from the dealer.  Given the confirmation and 
the other incidents, I would suggest that folks check their control arms even 
if the car has not been lowered.

Hopefully, this is not widespread so there's is no cause for alarm.  

I will be communicating with PCNA to explore this issue.


Cheers,

Sean,

The Potomac Region Club Race will use the standard Club Race format which is
2 open practice sessions for each run group (there will be 4 run groups of
approximately 25 cars each) followed by a third session Friday afternoon
consisting of practice starts and fun races for each group.  Saturdays
itinerary will be one warm-up session, one qualifying session and one feature
race for each group.
There is a cookout at the track Friday night, but I don't know details such
as cost or how to get tickets.  I would assume you could get tickets for the
dinner at the track Friday by seeing someone in registration.
There is a rumor floating around that there is going to be a "bragging
rights" showdown between Nick Ventura and Martin Snow at this event.  The
Chief Steward for this event (moi) finds this interesting and will paying
extra attention to the conduct of both drivers.
Cars will be going out on track at 9:30 Friday and 9:00 Saturday.
If you want to be even more involved, check with registration when you arrive
and I'm sure they could even find a worker spot for you.  It's a lot more fun
when you are directly involved in the event and Potomac Region is putting
this event on with an all volunteer crew.
If you come, look me up and say hello.  I will be in the tower while cars are
on the track but will be out and about at other times during the weekend.

Subject: T Top noises

In response to the following message.  After 5 relatively silent years, my
Targa top started making noise (a low frequency squeek).  I tried lubing the
indexing pins with silicone spray.  The noise became worse, TERRIBLE!  I
wouldn't consider driving with the top on, it was so bad.  Next I tried
cleaning the pins.  I used the same SEM vinyl cleaner I had bought to prep a
headliner re-paint.  Be careful with this stuff, as it is supposed to soften
the vinyl a bit.  Anyway, I just used on the plastic pin covers, and in the
pin sockets.  Instant silence!  :)  FWIW

I had recently treated the vinyl on the top.  Possibly some of the vinyl
dressing found it's way to the indexing pins and caused the squeek.
Cleaning them well certainly solved the problem.

The problem with lowered, track driven, 951's has been the ball joint stud
breaking in half catastrophically, and the suspension collapsing as a result,
usually at a bad place on a racetrack.  Ball joints can still wear out and
get loose.  Two ENTIRELY separate issues.  I've had a ball joint wear out on
our 951.  Got a rebuilt one from an advertiser in Panorama.  Some ball joints
just wear out early.  Happens on American cars, and happens on Porsches.

Subject: Bargain 911 Update


For those who are interested, here's where I'm at with the $1250 
(I still can't believe it!) '72 911T Coupe that I bought a few 
months ago for restoration/rebuilding.

The engine's out, apart and cleaned up.  Found only two 
problems, both minor.  One rod bearing had spun, but the 
crank journal looks fine and measurements show it is right on 
spec.  I will polish the crank and resize the guilty rod.  I've been 
told that once a bearing has spun, even if the rod big end looks 
and measures fine, and mine does, one should still refinish the 
rod to provide a good grip on the new bearing.  The second 
problem is that the top piston ring groove is worn and is now 
out of spec by a few thousandths, i.e., the side clearance exceeds 
the 0.004" spec.  On the previous 911 I did, where the top 
groove had worn to a few thousandths wider than spec, I 
simply used US standard 1/16" rings instead of 1.5 mm Porsche 
rings.  They are 0.0035" thicker, and accommodate that much 
wear.  In the present case the wear is greater and 1/16" isn't 
thick enough.  I also think the ring groove is so worn it should 
be squared up, so I'm having it grooved for a standard 5/64" 
ring which is 0.078" thick.  I don't have the bill yet, but a new 
piston/cylinder set is about $1500, and I think this will wind up 
costing less than $100.  Anyone ever followed this route instead 
of getting a whole new p/c set?

Heads are at German Precision getting a valve job.  

Transmission is cleaned up, and as far as I can tell is fine.  When 
I bought the car it was stuck in one gear, 1st or 2nd.  It looks to 
me like the previous owner must have forced the stick so hard 
that he managed to pop the shift selector lever out of it's proper 
position.  Now back in place it shifts through all gears just 
perfectly.  It's still possible that one of the selector rod detents is 
out of place.  I still have to check that.

I discovered that the car is equipped with alloy 'S' calipers in 
front, as well as Koni adjustables that seem OK.  Nice surprise.

Stay tuned.

Michael,

Don't take this the wrong way, but the only time I have heard of Porsche
suspensions doing something like this is when the owner either abused the
suspension or did not properly maintain the suspension. This would include
regular inspections just to verify everything is as it should be.

I know I would not take any car around a high speed corner unless I knew
the suspension was in proper condition.

Let us know what broke when you find out....

Sure could.  Depends on how it was preparted for storage and where
it was stored.

But I wonder.  Did you first warm the car to operating temperature before
checking the compression?  Or did you check a cold engine?

There can be a **huge** difference between warm and cold
tests.  The one that's meaningful is the one that's done
on a warm engine.  I hope you checked yours cold.  It still

Subject: Re: 944 Clutch

Darren,

Your rubber centre has gone to its great reward.  The difficulty in gear 
selection is because bits of it have lodged in places which inhibit
the normal motion of the clutch bits.

The clunking you feel is because of mechanical stops in the friction
disk centre.  They are sort of like big, loose splines which back up
the rubber centre.  The nice thing about them is that if the rubber
centre goes, you still have a car which can be driven -- gently --
home or to the shop. ( However, I've seen an example where someone
drove the car for an extended period on the stops, they failed, and
s/he was stranded.)

1st of all you should do some shopping. I use RD Enterprises (no affiliation)
for shocks and springs. 2nd of all at the very least while you have the rear
assembly apart put in shocks with those new springs. If the OEM springs are
on the car now, you need a spring compreser to do the job. It's NO FUN and 
dangerous. The replacements I have seen (since I was told OEM is NLA) need 
no compressing to install. Be carefull with the old springs, spring jobs 
give me nightmares. Have fun!

...on the way home from the PartsHeaven Swapmeet last weekend:

I say a Beck Spyder in a parking lot that I had to stop and look at.

The owner came out of a shop and we talked for a minute about the
car.  It has a 4 cyl VW engine now, but he has a 3.2 he plans
to put in it  :-0    Then he asked me if I wanted to see his *current*
project.  In his shop is a *massively* modified 928:  600hp (on the dyno)
supercharged motor.  Enormous racing tires.  Roll Cage.
Lot's of weight removed.  You get the picture.  What a project.
The car looked evil.  I may have to start following SCCA just to keep
track of the car.

What a great detour on my way home....

1st of all you should do some shopping. I use RD Enterprises (no affiliation)
for shocks and springs. 2nd of all at the very least while you have the rear
assembly apart put in shocks with those new springs. If the OEM springs are
on the car now, you need a spring compreser to do the job. It's NO FUN and

no compressing to install. Be carefull with the old springs, spring jobs 
give me nightmares. Have fun!

The standard practice is replace the clutch as a set, disk pressure plate.
Always replace the throw out bear any time you have taken the clutch off.
Just cheap insurance. What does it cost to R&R an eng,trans now. $500 +++.

For a street car I don't recomend any flywhell lightening. It makes that car

You're almost there.

There are two 10MM nuts under each quarter panel that you'll need to
remove.

Then the targa bar covering can be lifted up off the car.

On the 72 the oil tank must be removed/dropped down to get to the right 
side nuts.  

The tank is clamped on with one metal strap.

BTW, when it is time to re-install it, get some help to guide
the covering into position. 

This will lower your risk of chipping your new paint.

Subject: Chrome strips under Targa rear window...

Hi all,

When I took my Targa rear window out (73.5 T), the rear window was enclosed
in that expensive piece of rubber weatherstripping. The rear window and
aforemention rubber sat on a couple chrome strips. Under these chrome
strips were thin pieces of rubber that provided sometype of weatherstriping
between the chrome strips and the actual body.

Is this the way things are suppose to be?

I just bought a full set of weatherstripping from International Merchantile
(good company by the way, competitive prices and according to others on
this list, provide high quality weatherstripping) and they don't carry or
know anything about that weatherstripping below the chrome strip. They said
that their catalogs don't show this piece (althought they have had calls
before on this part before). I was told that the chrome strips are enclosed
by the rear window weatherstripping that I was sold.

What's the facts here?

Do I need the chrome strips at all? (Mine have seen better days and I was
going to buy some new ones).

Thanks!

Subject: DME chip?


Automotion/Weltmeister is looking for a car like mine (88 944S, Manual) to
finish up their power chip program.

Normally I would avoid the whole DME chip concept on general principal, being
of the opinion that there is too much mechanical variation among different
cars for them to be of much use.

However, the concept of using my actual car to base the DME profile on is
intriguing.

I've already spoken to them and they say they need the car for 2-3 days.
They use Dynan Engineering (a BMW shop, I believe?) to do their chips.
They stick on their own wheels/tires so mine won't get torn up on the dyno.

So, unless someone out there can talk me out of this I'm going to do it.

Besides, it will be cool to have a full 500 rpm increment torque/HP
graph before and after the chip (which they said I will get).

Any reason I'm going to regret letting them torture my car?  Since the 944S
has knock sensors I don't think they can actually damage the engine by
advancing the timing too much?

Thanks much.

Subject: Re: 911 Flywheel


Mike-

Check both the flywheel and pressure plates for signs
of small cracks on the face.  Replacement/machiningh is
in order if there are any.  Also, check the flywheel to
see how much of it is worn away by the clutch disc.  If
you can see/feel a ridge on the flywheel you ought to
have it resurface to better accomodate the new disc.
Machining a flywheel is inexpensive, especially
compared to the high price of Sachs pressure plates and
discs.

If the throw out bearing turns smoothly with no grinding
or rough sounds, it's OK.  A lot of people routinely replace a
throw out bearing when the clutch is done, just to be on
the safe side.  For lots of cars a TO bearing is $15, in
which case it makes sense.  For a 911 it's $100 which to
my way of thinking warrants rethinking popular wisdom.

If your disc is down to the rivets, I'd bet your pressure
plate is worn and that your flywheel needs resurfacing.
In fact, if any rivets became exposed, they would have scored
the flywheel/pressure plat and that would definitely mean
machining and replacing.

          -voltage at battery falls below 12 while car is running at
different RPM and speeds.
          -idiot light does not come on at all (Even when key is in accessory

13 volts to run)
          -Oil level gauge and sometimes others jump around

I have looked in and under engine compartment and haven't had any luck
locating it.  Could the car function without one?  Any other suggestions re:

Subject: CV joint question


  Hey P-filers,

  I have taken the halfshafts off of my '73 911T and dis- and re-assembled
  the CV joints. The joints themselves look to be in good shape. On the
  driver's side outer CV joint, the flange that the boot attaches to is
  eccentric (I guess if it came off of a cheap car it would be crazy  :->
  ). I was reasonably careful in taking these off, so I don't THINK that I
  caused it to be bent out of round, so if not me what may have caused
  this? Is this an indication that the joint is bad, and what constitutes a
  'good CV joint' vs one that needs replacement (ie what should I look for
  as far as wear, movement, etc.)? Would I be best off bringing the joints
  in to a shop and having them look at them? I prefer to do as much and
  learn as much as I can. Also, if the CV joint is good, can I
  replace/repair just the flange (4 bolt)? The flange on the passenger side
  outer axle is very slightly out of round, but not by much. Both inner CV
  joint flanges look OK.

  Another question that came to mind while doing this was, how can I check
  the condition of the wheel bearings and knowing their condition, how easy
  are they  to replace? I am aware that there is a tool ($200 plus) that
  does this 'in-situ', and I wouldn't mind buying the tool if needed.
  Anybody with experience with this?

  Thanks for any help.

Subject: Re: "Big Brake" question

	My understanding, being the one who asked about big brake upgrades for 
a 911S, is that the major benefits are twofold:

	1. Increase in braking power, which is only of value if you are short 
on the ability to apply friction, your point on being able to lock the wheels. 

	2. Increased heat sink capacity and heat radiation capacity. The 
larger calipers and rotors can absorb more heat without doing nasty stuff like 
boiling fluid and vaporizing pads and thus retain their capability for 
stopping. Porsche did a test between a C2 and an Acura NSX a couple of years 
ago. Both cars are very similar in horsepower and weight. teat was to 
accellerate to high speed (220 kmh or so) and then decelerate at maximum rate. 
By the 8th iteration, the Acura's brakes pads were burning, and it went past 
the stopped C2 at 80 kmh as its brakes were essentially completely faded. 
Brake pedal effort increase for the C2 was minimal while the NSX's pedal 
effort was very high with little effect as the brakes were not functioning at 
all. Porsche attributed this to heat sink and the open bridge caliper design, 
vented and cross drilled rotors all contributing to radiating the heat far 
faster than the NSX could.

My logic for upgrading is 50% to gain the benefits of 1 and 2, especially if I 
go back to Germany where you definitely eat brakes, the other 50% is pure 
vanity as I love the lookd of those shoebox sized calipers peaking out of my 
17 inch rims!! The power brake upgrade is only to make the larger calipers 
work as the manual master cylinder can't move enough fluid to fill all those 
pots....

Sorry for the longish note... I tend to wax lyrical from time to time

Subject: Re: 84-85 Carerra questions

Thom,

There are two spring assists on the 84-85 Carerras.  The first is a large
coil spring on the clutch pedal itself which was first used in 1974.  The PN
is ( I think) 911.423.305.06.  It is a pain in the keister to replace, but
can be done in the car.  Save up an adequate cache of 4 (or more) letter
words and go for it.
The second is referred to as the "over-center" or "horseshoe" spring and is
located on the bottom of the gearbox above the clutch arm.  The PN is
930.116.064.06 and is not that difficult to replace.  Once you are under the
car and see it, it is very straight forward.  There is also a third spring
going from the clutch arm to the side of the gearbox, but it has little
effect on clutch feel.  It is a small coil spring and it's job is to hold the
short clutch arm away from the long clutch arm's adjusting bolt, allowing you
to see and feel the freeplay between the two arms.  (Should be 1-2mm) PN is
915.116.614.02.
If you disassemble any of the rear clutch linkage, you will need to readjust
everything.  first, connect the cable to the long arm and adjust it with the
nuts on the bowden tube so there is no slop in the cable.  Tighten it so the
cable just starts to pull the arm off the stop, then back it off until the
arm just touches.  Then adjust the freeplay with the adjusting bolt so there
is 1-2mm between the end of the adjusting bolt and the short arm.  This makes
a big difference in the clutch pedal feel.
Also while you have the floorboard out to check the spring on the pedal
assembly, check the clevis pin bushing on the end of the clutch crosshaft,
where the cable connects to it.  If it is gone, the clevis pin has probably
started to wear the hole oblong and you will need a new crosshaft, bushing,
and clevis pin.  To do this you must remove the pedal assembly.

Hope this helps.

The following is a report on Day 3 of my use of SplitFires... the engine 
runs an incredible amount smoother compared to before, although, it has 
this tendency to go boomp-boomp when you back off the gas on an 
upgrade... This was there before, it isn't like a major thing, as it 
happens only 1 out of every 20 times, but it is more noticeable now. The 
beast appears to have slightly better midrange acceleration (30-50 mph), 
although, as I said, I have no numbers, so this is not a Slick 50 
'independent' study or anything... I haven't a clue about the time they 
last, as this is only day 3, although they do come with a 2 year (I 
believe, I'll get the warranty out tonight) warranty...

Obviously, I don't TRULY believe they'll have any major impact for 
changing such a piddly piece of engine can't have that type of effect... 
There are no good bolt on, or pour-in hot rodding tricks (well... octane 
booster seems to make a tank of gas last a little bit longer, but the car 
doesn't go any faster)... I do believe that the split fires will probably 
last longer, and due to the fact that this is an early GM inverse layout, 
changing spark plugs can take a great deal of time and effort (in the 
back 3)...

Either way, the car that these are being used on has had two major 
frontal collisions, runs relatively well for a 10 year old car, etc... 
and so is a good guinea pig for all sorts of things before they make 
their way to better cars... Luckily, I must say, that nothing has ever 
made the car any worse... but nothing has made this car a performer either...

In conclusion: Split Fire's (or as Stan prefers: ShitFire) not worth the 
money... They are nice to have, for there is more electrode area, but 
they don't gain anything... After all, you're not really changing the 
system, you're just modifying a little component of it...

Subject: Re: "Big Brake" question

Hi Barry,

As your speed increases, it becomes harder to lock the brakes.  You have
to overcome the energy of the rotating wheel, which goes up as the square
of the speed (I think!).  So despite being able to lock 'em up at 50 MPH,
it's a different story when going 150 MPH at the end of your favourite
track's long straight.

The bigger rotors have the advantage of greater heat sink mass.  That
means lower temperature rise for a given amount of sunk energy, and so
lessened problems with overheating of the pads, rotors, and fluid.

Larger pad area means larger pad volume and similar heat-sink grooviness.
It also means more pad area to do work.

A Cool Brake is pretty much essential, IMHO, for any 944 whose driver is
starting to learn go fast.  (Except George B.)  It will not, however, make
your 944/S brake like a 951/944S2.  I wrestled for years with keeping the
brakes of my 944S happy, and with marginal success: Cool Brake, high temp
fluid, Cool Carbon pads, rebuild/rebuild/rebuild, feh.  Even when they
didn't overheat, they simply would not slow the car enough.  At
Bridgehampton, that ended up meaning I had to coast a bit between Turn
7 and Turn 8, 'cause there just wasn't room to straighten out and slow
down enough (twice...)  Temperature paint showed pad edge temps above
1100 F, rotors above 1000 F.

The larger pad area and fixed-calliper design of the 951/944S2 brakes is
a night-and-day difference from the floating-calliper, single-piston 944
(928) brakes.  I upgraded to them, and now brake much later and have zero
fade.  Phenomenal.

booster seems to make a tank of gas last a little bit longer, but the car 
doesn't go any faster)... I do believe that the split fires will probably 
last longer, and due to the fact that this is an early GM inverse layout, 
changing spark plugs can take a great deal of time and effort (in the 
back 3)...

Either way, the car that these are being used on has had two major 
frontal collisions, runs relatively well for a 10 year old car, etc... 
and so is a good guinea pig for all sorts of things before they make 
their way to better cars... Luckily, I must say, that nothing has ever 
made the car any worse... but nothing has made this car a performer either...

In conclusion: Split Fire's (or as Stan prefers: ShitFire) not worth the 
money... They are nice to have, for there is more electrode area, but 
they don't gain anything... After all, you're not really changing the 
system, you're just modifying a little component of it...

Hi all - I have a 79 924 with the heated power mirrors (yes the same ones on
your expensive p-cars too). Sometimes they work and adjust properly in all
directions. Sometime they just sit there and vex me. Anybody have any ideas
on how to trouble-shoot them?

BTW - keep the 924 stuff coming. Even though I long to move up to 951 or a
944S2, the 924 is fun to drive and it is cheap! It gets around a short track
like Gateway in St. Louis pretty quick. It's going to be another story at
Road America! I feel the need for speed.........

Subject: Excellence - 911S article


I quote from the 6/95 _Excellence_ article, "Faster Than Schnell" by David
Colman: "But the euphoric good times came to an end in 1974. That was the
year all 911's (911, 911S and 911 Carrera), regardless of model
designation, served up exactly the same amount of horsepower. ... How dare
the company build a 2.7 liter, so-called S, that put out exactly the same
horsepower as the garden variety 911?"

Okay, am I missing something here? I have one of these '74 models, and the
spec book and Bruce Anderson's book point out that the "garden variety" '74
911 had engine type # 911/92 and was good for 150 DIN HP with 175 lb-ft of
torque, whilst the 911S and Carrera had type # 911/93 with 175 and 187.
While I know engineers that would claim 175 was "exactly" the same as 150
(what's 20% or so among friends?), I certainly would not. Too, while the
2.4 liter is a great engine (and the 2.7 has more than its share of
problems), the stock 2.7 (even "garden variety") has more low end torque
than the 2.4 S engine. And, sure, the change to the CIS and the milder cam
dropped the HP (190 to 175), the bigger bore brought the torque up (158 to
187). AND you don't have to wait 'til 6500 revs to get at the HP peak on
the 74 engine either (it comes at something like 5800). Of course, the red
line on the 2.4 S was quite a bit higher than the 2.7.

I am not saying the 2.4S was bad (it most certainly was GOOD), I am just
trying to salvage some measure of dignity for those of us unfortunate
enough to have a '74 model. Though the author rags on the rubber bellows
crash bumpers, I actually like my '74...

Subject: 914 rebuild

Dear P-files
My 914 engine project is going nicely, I broke down the main engine today 
and found a valve in pieces in cylinder #3, with a cracked piston and  
rings in pieces. So that's why the po said it wouldn't drive no more! ;)
I am going to increase my engine displacement to 1.8. I know this is a 
stupid question, but is there any difference in heads between the 1.7 and 
1.8? I still have sodium valves in the orginal heads- I plan on keeping 
them and having them reground. Is that a good idea? I plan on putting 
hydralics in to make it a hydralic  1.8. ( I know Stan, you don't like 
the idea, but I am making this a later model engine )  I will get a 
hydralic cam, lifters too.  My final question is compression- The 1.8 was 
really low (7 something) what would be best way to increase compression?  
I am also going to hemi-cut the heads, to make the unleaded gasoline a 
bit more digestable.
Thanks for all your help!

Subject: Hirschmann power antennas

Paul,
The little ring with the two slots is the piece you need to unscrew.  It's 
called an "escutcheon" and you will need something like a set of snap ring 
pliers to undo it. Directly below it, is a spacer and below that, is a 
rubber gasket.  Once you undo the escutcheon, the antenna can be removed 
from the bottom of the fenderwell. Make sure you dont just drop it.  You can 
prevent this by holding the antenna mast.  I am assuming that you know how 
to undo the unit by removing the screw that secures the "L" shaped bracket 
inside the fenderwell.  I also found that the leads going into the unit are 
very short and had to unscrew the plastic grommet and rubber seal first, 
then removed  the plate cover off the unit to release the wires from within 
the unit before the unit can come off the car. (the antenna wire also needs 
to be unscrewed)  BTW if you are only replacing the mast you do not have to 
take the unit off the car.  All you do is to unscrew the escutcheon, have 
someone turn on the radio and while the mast is extending pull it out of the 
unit.  To reinstall, you thread the plastic mast lead back into the unit as 
far as it will go and then have someone turn off the radio,      thereby 
retracting the mast back into the unit. 
Voila! you are done.

The little hole is indeed an inspection port to view the TDC marks on the 
camshaft sprocket and should be closed off with a 75cent rubber grommet. I 
however don't think that your moisture problem is due to this hole being 
open.  IMHO I think you should check the distributor cap for hairline cracks 
and also the condition of the gasket between the cap and the camshaft cover.

Subject: Re: 944 Wet Distributor

The most likely cause is a water pump leak

what is happening is you are dribbling a small quantity of water on to 
the cam belt, this is being spun off when you try to start the engine.
Try tasting the water - if you have any anti-freeze, the water tastes 
revoltingly sweet.

There should be a plastic disk behind the rotor arm to stop muck getting 
into the dist cap, if this is missing then the water gets into the cap.

The plastic disk get left off, because often the rotor arm cannot be 
removed from the cam shaft, so you cannot remove the cam belt. Crook 
mechanics break the disk, remove the belt ...

I am surprised that the small amount of water that you get in the dist 
cap is sufficient to stop the car firing. This sounds like the last 
straw, ie your motor has so many minor problems that the bit of moisture 
is just too much.

When were the plugs, air filter etc last changed, are you burning oil?
is the ignition timing correct?

Hope you find your problem

Subject: Carrera Engine Failure?

A friend of mine has an 1986 Carrera engine with a custom chip and a 915
transmission. At a track event, he overaccelerated going into corner, the
rev limiter came on at 7,300 revs to cut the engine off, and then a few
seconds later after getting back on straight, he stepped on gas but engine
was low on power. It turned out, valve was bent and valve guide was in pieces.
How can that happen? Valves should not get bent from the gas pedel when the
rev limiter is working  - valves should only be bent by misshifting into too
low a gear ( ie 5th to 2nd) and where it causes engine revs to go above
8,000 rpm. Anybody got an idea? Could custom chip cause this problem ( even
though the rev limiter did come on) ? Could valve be weak from past and then
later bend from acceleration?

    Unmodified Panteras are hard to find. Most owners are heavy on making them
 look like a Countach (complete with flares and wing) but a stock Pantera is
 a beautiful car (tip your hat to Tom Tjarda).
    Call Hall Pantera in Bellflower, CA for tips and a catalog.  Most prices
 for Pantera parts from Hall are actually very fair, and a huge amount of
 aftermarket product exists to spend on the car.
    Panteras are famous for rust (the kind that goes to the core) and
 overheating. There are a couple dozen "solutions" for the overheating
 problem...its just a matter of money. I nearly bought a '74 L, but at the  
 time was driving a 928; if you've driven either, you'd have to agree the  
 Pantera is  a world behind as a driver, and (despite the domestic V8) not a
 dime cheaper to really drive than a Ferrari (a 308 will cost you just a bit
 more anyways).  The Cleveland motor is famous for making power, but is groggy
 at lower throttle and is NOT famous for its reliability (poor crank oiling).

    As with any car this old, maintenance and care means everything. Avoid an
 abused car.

This isn't a big deal on most cars, but because you have to replace

35k miles seems a bit low - you may be able to get PCNA to replace
the arm at their expense.  If not, there is a place in Texas that

I will be posting a summary of the information which others may

Second, my 914 has a solenoid trunk release mechanism which I cannot

engine compartment from the trunk and when I tap it to the positive 
lead of the battery I can hear a dull <thunk> but the trunk does not
release.  I have had an assistant try to push/pull on the lid while I
engaged the solenoid, but to no avail.

Could it be an improper ground?  I need to find a way to get into

Anyone else have any ideas?

So far I haven't gotten a response about my friends AC problem..(perhaps 
you are all sick of my 911SC questions, not to mention Toyota questions...)

Anyway, my friends AC in his 1980 911SC makes a very obnoxious loud sound 
that can be best described as a off-tune saxaphone.  We both think that 
it is the fan.  To get the noise to stop, he has to turn down the AC, 
wait...then turn it back on.  Usually the noise stops, for a little bit.  
Then this whole routine is repeated.  His mechanic at Dennis Sherman says 
that many Porsches do this, and that it would take 3 hours of labor just 
to look at it.  He said "That's why they invented radios."

Does anyone know whats going on?

Terry,

Yes, I noticed this too.  Mr. Coleman made an error I'm think.  Your point on
the low end torque of the larger displacment engine is well taken and makes
the '74's nice drivers, more tractable than and early "S."

However, for sheer on the cam acceleration and a real push the 2.4S's stand
alone.  Don't forget, too, that these cars were lighter (I don't recall the
exact weights) and had all the neat goodies.

Content-Type: Message/rfc822
Content-Description: RFC822

 My understanding, being the one who asked about big brake upgrades for 
a 911S, is that the major benefits are twofold:

 1. Increase in braking power, which is only of value if you are short 
on the ability to apply friction, your point on being able to lock the wheels. 

 2. Increased heat sink capacity and heat radiation capacity. The 
larger calipers and rotors can absorb more heat without doing nasty stuff like 
boiling fluid and vaporizing pads and thus retain their capability for 
stopping. Porsche did a test between a C2 and an Acura NSX a couple of years 
ago. Both cars are very similar in horsepower and weight. teat was to 
accellerate to high speed (220 kmh or so) and then decelerate at maximum rate. 
By the 8th iteration, the Acura's brakes pads were burning, and it went past 
the stopped C2 at 80 kmh as its brakes were essentially completely faded. 
Brake pedal effort increase for the C2 was minimal while the NSX's pedal 
effort was very high with little effect as the brakes were not functioning at 
all. Porsche attributed this to heat sink and the open bridge caliper design, 
vented and cross drilled rotors all contributing to radiating the heat far 
faster than the NSX could.

My logic for upgrading is 50% to gain the benefits of 1 and 2, especially if I 
go back to Germany where you definitely eat brakes, the other 50% is pure 
vanity as I love the lookd of those shoebox sized calipers peaking out of my 
17 inch rims!! The power brake upgrade is only to make the larger calipers 
work as the manual master cylinder can't move enough fluid to fill all those 
pots....

Sorry for the longish note... I tend to wax lyrical from time to time

Hardtop. Karmann hardtops are rare but not valuable. This car is in good shape
(certainly not concours). It is yellow with black interior. The interior and
paint were redone about 7 years ago. The engine was rebuilt at that time (it
is a Super) with NPR big bore barrels. The engine is stock otherwise. The 
transmission was rebuilt at that time (with new synchros and bearings). The
car looks good, but it has a lot of bondo in it. It has been converted to a 12
volt system and has the 5 1/2 inch brazilian chrome wheels. It has been driven
about 10,000 miles since it was redone ( I have 4 other cars, so it doesn't get
driven much). I am asking $8,000. The car is located in Arkansas (as I am).

Subject:       Lightened Flywheel

To All and Sundry:

Mike Willis' comment on lightened flywheels rang a bell with me.  My 
'75 911S tends to bog when I let out the clutch at a light, even if I 
have the revs up.  Once it gets moving things are fine, but the first 
ten feet are usually kinda slow.  Now I'm wondering if perhaps my 
car has a lightened flywheel.

You see, the P.O. lost the documentation on the engine rebuild, and 
he couldn't remember all the details.  I've been trying to piece 
together what all was done, but I fear I'll never know.

So, can anyone tell me what the advantages, disadvantages, and 
symptoms of a lightened flywheel are?  Whether or not I actually have 
one, I'm curious as to what they are good for (I can guess, but I'd 
rather ask).

It's wonderful to hear someone talk up a '74 with the often harangued  2.7. 
I have humbly driven a '74 911 for 6 years. I love it. If there is such a 
thing as an understated Porsche, this is it. To take it a step further, it's 
brown!

I bought this car with 125k miles and a fresh, properly rebuilt and updated 
engine in 1989. Since then it has been a daily driver everywhere I have 
lived, Portland, OR to Toronto, ONT. to Vancouver B.C. back to Portland OR. 
Only in Toronto, in the winter (heavy salt), did I resort to a beater to 
commute. It now has 185k and is running very strong. It has been from 
Northern Maine to the Florida Keys; from San Diego to the northern tip of 
Vancouver Island. It the last two summers alone I have logged 6,000 miles in 
road trips with many hours of triple digit speeds.

On top of all this commuting and road trip use, it is a notorious track car! 
I have driven it numerous times at Mosport and Shannonville Ontario, Watkins 
Glen NY, and probably 50+ times at Portland International Raceway. There is 
nothing more gratifying on a track then driving my light weight homely 
little 911 right past 944's, 911 SC's and even the occasional Carrera.  Now 
it is evolving into a PCA Club Racer and it's first event will be the 
Portland race August 13.

These cars are amazing, I doubt that I could ever be content driving 
anything less and I seldom see anything comparable.

Subject: high-performance hype solution

 The more I hear about all these "performance parts/fluids/etc" the more it 
 seems that their performance claims can be verified by using one of three 
 techniques:
 
 (1) Gee Wiz Method
 ------------------
 
 Manufacturer makes some nifty claim and demonstrates it in an ad.  Everyone 
 goes "gee wiz"!  But their experiment has NO CONTROL GROUP to show what would 
 happen if their product was NOT used.
 
 -Engines running without oil because of an additive:  Hmmmm, do engines run 
 without oil even no additive was present?  They do.  Just as well as the ones 
 WITH the additive
 
 -Magic Spark plugs are inserted into an engine and instant horsepower gains are 
 measured.  Hmmm, what if a clean set of STANDARD plugs was installed?  For the 
 most part if the previous plugs were crummy, instant horsepower gains will 
 result.  (In my best David Spade imitation) It's called a TUNE-UP! Get one!
 
 (2) Gedankin (sp) Experiment
 ---------------------------
 
 Ahhhh, the things I learned in my Physics days.  Make a little mental 
 experiment by looking at the extremes.  If you are interested in the effects of 
 coolant flow (a discussion on the Brit Car list where it was asserted that 
 slower flowing coolant will stay in the radiator longer and thus cool the car 
 more) look at the extremes.  Coolant flows infinitesimally slow: cyl head heats 
 and boils, coolant in radiator cools off to ambient and just sits there.  Bad!  
 Coolant flows infinitely fast: water in rad and head are same temp. Good!
 
 -Filtercharging:  Hmmm, if I reduce the flow restriction, I get a bit more 
 horse power.  What if I totally eliminate the restriction?  Even MORE flow! 
 What if I totally block off the air?  No contaminates enter the engine.  AH!!! 
 I see!  There is a trade off between filtration and flow rate!
 
 (3) Why isn't the car Made that way! (thanks to STAN)
 ------------------------------------
 
 Self explanatory.  If car get 10 more HP and 15% better mileage with the 
 addition of a $10 part, why doesn't the car manufacturer use it?  Is it because 
 the "hype-rformance" part manufacturer is making so much money on the 
 aftermarket that he would rather not seel to a big company?  Uh... if you 
 believe that, look at corporate earnings or perhaps see if Slock-50 or 
 ShitFires stock is calculated into the Dow Jones average.
 
 Well, that's it for now. Caveat Emptor!

I really don't want to add a universal one:  Main reason is that the

The original mount looks like it's welded on and its easier just to  
add on the rear view mirror.

Magnetic numbers are very sensitive to the thickness of the paint (and 
bondo) thickness. If the car has never been repainted magnetics are fine, if 
not you might want to look into static cling numbers on the inside of the 
rear window if your club doesn't have a size restriction that prohibits 
this. Up here in the Northwest a lot of people use static cling.

914 which has a 2.0L and a "severely" lightened flywheel. I'm convinced
that when I go back to a stock flywheel my problems may be fixed. BTW,
I've had the FI and ignition worked on to no end to fix these problems,
but they still persist. And I too, have the transitional bog others have
noted. It does spin up nicely, though.

For this, another solution would be to mount the normal vinyl numbers
and letters (for classes) on a background.  Pegasus has white circles
for mounting numbers on in either magnetic, static cling or adhesive
application.  

I've been quite happy with the contact/shelf paper solution.  Remember
to wax the paint first, and then if you use a water bottle and spray a
fine mist over the area before applying the number, you can work the
air bubbles out and get the possitioning with a lot less work.

Hi Ross,

How does this work?  The "cup" of the control arm ball joint is the
control arm casting itself.  Does this place sleeve it in some way,
or is the assumption that the cup is OK and all you need is to replace
the rest of the bits?

BTW, getting the circlip out is a trick.  It's not designed, at its

Yes.

There is a thin piece of rubber under the chrome strips.

I replaced my rear Targa window after a repaint, so I got some personal
experience.

The 72/73 parts book, which I have at home, has the part number.

It is a dealer only item.

I re-installed mine.

When it comes to manufactured items, I assume if the profit oriented company 
tooled up for a non-cosmetic part, produced it and installed it, then the 
part has a good functional reason for existing.

But I can't say for sure the chrome strips are needed.  

Possibly the rear window gasket shifts during driving and can wear
away the paint if the chrome strip isn't there.

You might consider re-chroming the strips, or getting better ones
from a salvage yard.

Uhm, I don't mean to be rude, but this mailing list has the highest "signal
to noise" ratio of any mailing list or newsgroup I've ever seen. What do
expect this list to be anyway. An official "help-line"? This an open forum
for people to talk about the cars we love and technical issues that concern
them. We are -NOT- a corporate help-line or a proffesional on line
technical assistance program. We are 1200+ porsche owners who have a fairly
broad base of experience and would like to share that experience. Yes,
there are proffesionals on this list, but I don't expect them to respond to
each and every question as soon as it's posed. And secondly, I wouldn't
call it "worthless jabber". Just because the topic of someones mail doesn't
pertain to what you're interested in doesn't mean it's worthless. I play
with 914s, but I don't consider all of the 911 and water-pumper posts to be
worthless. There's still quite a lot of usefull info out there. 

Yes, there is a very large volume of mail that goes through this list, 1200
+ porsche folks with internet access tend to create a high volume of text
spewing accross the lines. But if you're not interested in it, don't read
it.

Ok, I've spewed enough for now, unka bart? some more green ones please...

P.S. I would like to say that I am always pleased to see profesional porsche
people on this list, but don't expect this to be entirely dry and technical
. It wouldn't be as much fun to read if it was.

[This is the best mailing list I have ever seen. The list seems to be made 
 up of a lot of guys with older cars that they have restored themselves.  
 Hat off to you guys, I'm envious.]

I'm in a tough spot and need some help from the vets (no pun intended)
around here.
 
I currently have an `88 951 that is in very good shape.
Having learned more about the boosted '44, I have started to desire an
'89 951 or the unobtainable `88 Turbo S.

I have since come across a very low milage '89 951 that is almost perfect
but is priced very high w.r.t. market value.

This situation brings up the following questions.

1) What exactly is the different between an '88 951 and an '89?
   (for the millionth time I'm sure.)

2) What is a good price for a very low milage '89?

3) What is a good price for a below average miles '88?  The local 
   dealership offered me $9500 for a flat buy out.  I laughed in his face
   and he admitted I could get $14K+ fairly easy (just did some paint work).

4) Would I be better off to put the extra money I would have spent getting
   the '89 into my '88?

5) Can any of the later S2's be turbocharged and if so, is that an
   interesting option to the '89?

6) What are the mods I can do to a stock '88 951?  Which should be done
   first for the biggest gain?
	Chip it?
	Bigger turbo?
	+1-2" wheel/tire set?
	etc.

I have obviously been bitten by the Porsche/Power bug. Any help is 
appriciated!!!

ps.  My local dealership is supposed to get a new 911 Turbo (996?)
     this week.  Anyone on the list driven one yet?  Drool.

Subject: Bra for 911


I have purchased a porsche bra for my new to me porsche 911. I have
a red car with low miles (so the paint still looks good). In searching for 
this car I saw alot of red cars with many nicks, I assume from street 
gravel and such. I expect to use the bra for longer trips to keep the
nick and bug count down, and I have some questions about its use.

For those that choose not to use a bra, why not (other than esthetic)?

For those that do, what is the best procedure for it's use?
Is it OK to leave the bra on in the garage for an extended period
of time? 
What about in the sun? 
Under what conditions will the bra damage the paint?
Is there anything I should do other than take it off to dry if it gets wet?

Any insights would be appreciated.

I'm not 100% certain on this.  It appeared that they had cut the
seem of the weld, inserted the new ball joint, and rewelded the
control arm cup.  I hope that makes sense.  The name of the company
is European Dynamic Something-or-other (Engineering maybe?).  They
advertise in Pano and/or Excellence.  You might give them a call.

So far, I've put almost 10k miles on the new joint with no problems.
For a daily driver that sees an occasional auto-x I think it's a 
good solution.  For a car that sees a lot of track time I'd invest
in the FABCAR control arms or the control arms that Nathan Ulrich 
advertised a few days ago.

I'll be under the car sometime before the end of this weekend.  I'll
take a closer look at them then.

Subject: Re: Bra for 911

Dear Darryl,

This is the sort of thing that belongs in a FAQ--not an answer,
necessarily, but a summary of the debate.  The bra is an American
invention, and the factory types from Germany still don't see what we
see in them.  Some people still don't like them.  "I'd rather repaint
my hood every once in a while," I've been told.  Well, I wouldn't.

To make a long story short, a bra will help protect your painted front
end.  It's not perfect.  Especially on lowered cars, pieces of road
junk will collect between the bra and the front valence.  The question
is, whether the junk will do more harm if it is stationary or if it is
moving toward your hood and windshield.  I think the former. 

The caveats are, therefore:  take it off and clean the backing after a
trip.  Don't leave it on in the rain, especially if the car is
standing still.  Don't put it on paint that isn't fully cured.  And
(this will only apply if your car has been repainted with lacquer)
don't let bare vinyl rest on lacquer paint.  That's why the back is
flocked.  I once had a horror story with a vinyl piano cover on a
black lacquer Steinway--the exposed vinyl along the seams etched into
the lacquer and made funny scratch and hatch marks.  It took a while
before I realized what that was--thought it was my cat's doing.

Subject: 951 Control  Arms


Well,

The only explanation I can offer on only the left side being bad is thus,
consider which direction you turn on most freeway exits. It is to the right
in many cases. The cornering loads go to the outside of the car, the left 
front wheel in this case.  Some RX-7s have the rear floorpan 
sheetmetal get very distorted over time.

If the rear of your 924/944/968 is set to ride high for the bumper/crash
test requirements, you will throw even more force against the control arm.

Set the car to level height, get a good alignment. Put some (1/2 to 3/4
degree negative) camber in the front. you will have much better stick in 
the front with somewhat lower forces.

And above all, avoid roads that have bad pot holes. That does a lot more 
damage than you think to ALL cars. Some RX-7s have the rear floorpan 
sheetmetal get very distorted over time after being continually driven over
pot holed roads.

As Kevin Gross and others have pointed out, these are ball joints working 
loose rather than catstrophically.

Hello 'philes,

A while back I was driving a '76 911S with a 3.2L euro-spec
engine (231 HP).  Fast, fun car....about as fast as my 914....
and even more scary when the gas pedal jammed against
the tunnel as I was approaching a corner!!!

The stamped metal "pivot" piece of the pedal assembly
suffered from a broken factory weld and moved sideways
to jam itself against the tunnel - holding the throttle wide
open.

I've heard of this happening on another local 911.

During the replacement of my throttle cable on my 914,
my mechanic discovered a similar broken weld between
the stamped metal "pivot" piece and the metal pin.  I fixed
this last Saturday by removing the part and re-welding it.

Next time you have a chance, check out your gas pedal
and associated lever assembly for side-to-side movement.
You shouldn't find much play....if you do, it could be a
weak gas pedal itself, similar broken weld problem as I
had, or worn bushings.  Whatever it is, have it properly
fixed ASAP.....I was very lucky I didn't go flying into
something!!!

Take care,

A 911 is very different from a 944.  

911: An early 911will be expensive if it is in good shape or even if it is in
restorable shape.  (71 - 73) 911s 's  are very fast and very desirable. 
Save more money if you want this one.

944:  These are more in the price range of $6 - 8K and I see more
becoming available as sellers start to move into newer 944s.  944s are
also easier to drive and the office is more driver oriented (read race
oriented).  This would be my pick especially if you can get an S (16
valves).

window-mounted light, it's a rubber-based adhesive that can be removed
without damaging the rear window defroster.  If I recall, the lines of
the heating element don't interfere.  Since the third brake light is a
U.S. atrocity, I don't think the lines were curved in the way American
cars are--that is, I don't think Porsche made a specific rear window
for the U.S. market.

Conversely, my Porsche mechanic mounted one in his '85 Mercedes to
create an '86 factory look.

At one time, _Motor Trend_ ran a piece on ten things to watch out for:
drivers with hats, drivers whose heads do not project above the seat
back--in short, drivers who are likely to be inattentive and
notoriously conservative.  I would add people with big old cars with
aftermarket third brake lights!

Actually, the '72 911S and '73 911S are the real desirable and expensive
early 911's. The 911E's from '72 and '73 are actually a little better for
daily driving due to the street oriented power curve. There is nothing to
special about the '71 911's.

944's are easier to drive at the limit sure. But they are not any faster
and, based on what I can see, may be a tad slower when the 911 (when the
power to weight ratio is similar) is in competent hands. Anyone that wants
to race a 911 is going to take a little more time getting up to speed, but
watch out when they figure it all out.

What, pray tell, "is more driver oriented" about the 944 cockpit when
compared to a 911 cockpit? The cockpits are different for sure, but I
cannot see how the 944 would be any better. Especially the early 944
cockpit.

Both the 944 (later models) and 911 are very nice cars. I would pick
the one that turns you on the most. Why drive a 911 when you really
want a 944?? Why drive a 944 when you really want a 911???

Subject: Re: 86 Carrera collapsed rear suspension

Well,
my car (three years older than yours) did something similar recently, it turned
out to be a torsion bar failure.  This is apparently NOT very common.

I looked at the failed part and it looked like a flaw in the forge/cast (I
don't know which it is) process.  It also appeared to be factory original.
I agree I was upset at the prospect of this happening at speed or in a turn
(neither was the case for me, just when I was in stop and go traffic).

I must say, it took 80000 plus miles and 11 years before the flaw became 
critical though.  That is realistic in my opinion.  We drive old (relatively)
cars, we must expect things to break from time to time.

BTW, I believe it is accepted practise to replace both rear torsion bars at
once, and not just one side (if this is what really failed).

Hi Barry,
Magnetic numbers are OK but tend to scratch the paint and blow off. Not to

keep them on.
I used to make my numbers out of a stencil kit that is available at any art
supply or office supply store and white vinyl shelf paper. Just trace the
numbers desired onto the paper and cut them out with sharp scissors. They are
low tack and come off easily when you want them to come off. There is no risk
to the paint.

It sounds like you broke your torsion bars!  Egad!!

If you replace them yourself, it's cheap - even new aftermarket bars
are only $200 or so.  If you pay someone else to do it?  Hmmm, I would

When I bought my car the PO would NOT stop talking about the $1400 stereo he

it was a negative as I would have to remove it, locate and install
replacement door pannels and locate and install a period 911 radio.

It turned out the engine exhaust valve guides had about 5mm of play, the MFI
pump had been jury rigged to avoid a rebuild and the transmission was
defective. Also the car had tires from 1986 which were hard as rocks.  It
would have been nice if he spent the $1400 on some of this.

Of course this does not mean everyone with nice stereos in early 911s ignore
the mechanical integrity of their cars. But I must say that (for early 911s
driven for recreational pleasure) an expensive stereo does not add vale and
could be a warning signal.

"The second

groove had worn to a few thousandths wider than spec, I 
simply used US standard 1/16" rings instead of 1.5 mm Porsche 
rings.  They are 0.0035" thicker, and accommodate that much 
wear.  In the present case the wear is greater and 1/16" isn't 
thick enough.  I also think the ring groove is so worn it should 
be squared up, so I'm having it grooved for a standard 5/64" 
ring which is 0.078" thick.  I don't have the bill yet, but a new 
piston/cylinder set is about $1500, and I think this will wind up 
costing less than $100.  Anyone ever followed this route instead 
of getting a whole new p/c set?"

My 71 911E had the same problem on all pistons, i.e. the top piston ring
groove was rounded and the machining required to re-square the groove made
the groove too wide for a single ring. Since I did not plan to race the car
or drive it at high rpm for extended periods of time, the head mechanic
sugested to use TWO rings per groove. He installed a new Porsche ring of
standard width with another, thin US ring. The combination would give the
right gap.  I wish I could remember why a single wide ring is undesireable,
but I did not include this in my notes. I think the rings seated quite
slowly. The idle smoking (see below) decreased steadily throughout  the first
2K miles but it never went completely away. 

I have about 4K miles on the engine and it works well (so far!).  The oil
consumption is well below specification. I have noticed the generic "cloud of
blue smoke"  during some - but not all - cold starts. Occasionally (oil T
showing 180 or greater) at idle there will be more blue smoke than I would
prefer and I can not correlate this with anything driving hard, loafing
along, etc. I have never noticed smoke upon hard acceleration or extended
engine braking (deacceleration).

If your pistons are otherwise in good shape (mine looked perfect when cleaned
up and all other measurements were in spec) and the cylinder walls also check
out, you might want to try this fix.

I suspect as others do the torsion bar broke, perhaps the inner support which 
holds the inside of the spline went poof as well or as a cause. 

As to why, my understanding is that these bars are taking some pretty severe 
stresses as a result of all the suspension movement over time. If a crack 
begins to develop, maybe at a rust pit or perhaps a flaw (what!! would Porsche 
actually have a flaw in a part??) the stresses will over a relatively short 
period of time cause the steel to fracture. 

Carroll Smith has a nice article in his book Engineer to Win which talks in 
layman's terms about stress and fatique....may not fix your problem but will 
at least give you an insight as to what happened.

For normal track events, good mag numbers will work just fine - assuming you
don't have a door full of Bondo.  If the numbers do not lay flat due to
improper storage or whatever, you can put a small piece of tape on the
leading edge to keep air from getting under the number and lifting it.
another thing to be careful of is the grit than can get under it.  A good
coat of wax on both the door and the bottom of the number will help there.
Many moons ago I bought a roll of the heavy duty stuff from a company in
Ohio and used templets to cut out the various numbers.  Found that the door
on the spare fridge in the basement was a wonderful place to store them to
keep them flat.
 Current hot setup seems to be the static cling numbers but I have found that
they don't like a nice wax job and can come free at speed.

My 1980 SC does the same thing.  It's done it for the entire 4.5 years
I've owned it.  When really bad, at low speed, it will stop blowing.  I
think it's a bearing in the fan unit in the little 'secret compartment'
that used to hold gas heaters in older cars up in the front trunk.  It
gets better as the summer wears on, so I suspect it's partially a
lubrication problem.  You'll find that thunking the unit (while the car is
stationary, preferably) will often stop the squeal for a bit as well.  As
the units cost several hundred dollars, I've been waiting for the final
squeak, but it ain't come yet...

I have the 17" X 8" & 9" RUF (original style) on my 911, and have mixed
feelings about them.

They look fully boss, and have a maximum of pose quality, and the workmanship
is excellent. 
The downside is that they are really heavy, which supposedly "stabilizes" the
car on the old autobahn, but makes them a decidedly lousy choice for autoX or
track.
Another down is that the flange tipe rim is easily scraped on curbs and such,
although several tire companies have started to mold a protective lip on the
lower profile tires. (Yoko AVS for example). 
All in all its hard to beat the factory alloys, that's what I use on the
track. Maybe the OZ wheels are lighter?

80 street hours if you drive them hard. Difference is, I can *freshen*
a race motor and have it back in the harness that day, but these big
bore hummers, when they go, you usually get to start over again with all 
new parts. Well, I take that back -- at least new *CASE* and often cam
and crank. Carrillos are roughy indestructible and the pistons and cylinders
usually aren't a problem...

I keep being asked if there's maybe not a way to "mate" all the things I
know about high-performance engines and high-reliability engines to build
a large displacement street engine that gets 100k miles. It's not likely --
just the increased heat alone will mean you need a rebuild significantly
sooner, and the added torque from banging that larger piston down a longer
hole means the mains had *BETTER* be checked very frequently....

No free lunch, guys.

Subject: Whale tail for 912E

I am looking for a tail for my '76 912 and have heard that there can be a
problem getting a good fit.
There certainly is a shortage of parts in my area. Would it be a good idea
to pick up a replacement hood to mount the tail on, thereby perserving the
original body? The body is in mint condition and I have had the engine
redone. I would like to maintain its authenticity as close to the original
as possible, but must admit that I did put a alpine in it and would like the
cosmetic look of a tail.

Subject: What color to paint?  Your .02 wanted!

Always repaint a car the original color.  When rock chips occur,
and they always do, the old color will show back through.  It is
very difficult to do a color change without disassembling the car.
My 66 912 came from the factory paint code 6609 (black).  It had
been repainted to BRG.  Whoever performed this abortion did a
very complete job.  It took me a couple of hours to find any black
when I inspected it before purchase.  When I repainted, I repainted
it green again.  The prospect of disassembling all those parts and
shooting the jambs correctly just turned me off.  Bottom line, if you
want a red, (or black or (for godsakes) yellow) car, buy that color car.

I wish mine was still black.

Rick:   take your pick on springs, depending on your requirements.  However,

have to pay more than ~$500 for the shocks, and anyone can replae the front

Well, I've always liked the 911.  That's why I bought one.  I still prefer the
944s cockpit, though.  In particular,  the shifter is shorter and positioned
high.  The orientation of the pedals are better suited to driving
techniques, like heel and toeing and double clutching.  On my 911sc,  I
tie-strapped a block of wood to the accelerator pedal to bring it closer
and adjusted the brake pedal forward to match the acc. pedal.   Now,
they are closer together when I brake hard.   The clutch, though, still has
a longer travel than I am used to.  These little things add up.   Look in a
cockpit of a 962.    Everything is positioned better for the driver.  You
don't see a long shifter.   Anyway, the newer 911s (C2 and C4)  shifter
has improved dramatically.  I guess, we could go on and on, on this one. 
But anything that improves the driver-to-car interface will improve that
persons driving at the limit, whether its a smaller steering wheel, better
grip with gloves and shoes, more supportive seat, 5 point harness, etc.
You might step into one car, adjust everything, and say "this car fits like
a glove"  and step into another and say "this is going to take awhile".

Anyway, thats what I meant!!

My friend owns an alarm/stereo shop and he sells BEL and the K40? devices.  I

Subject: Chagrin d'amor endure la vie...

Please forgive the non-automotive bandwidth, but you are my friends, and
once *again,* I seek the catharsis of unburdening my self to my friends.

Those of you on this list for a year may remember the painful passage of
my old buddy Spike last August.  Tuesday, I had the anguish of giving the
last loving gift, that of surcease from the pain of living, to my Sweet
Little Precious varmint, Felix.  At the moment, my heart is filled with
grief; my attachment to Felix is making a mockery of my alleged ability
to deal with life's viscisitudes ...

He hadn't eaten anything for the last 8 to 10 days, and only a few
nibbles in the week preceding that.  His liver had failed him, and that
was exacerbated by his failing thryoid.  He wanted food, but the smell of
it nauseated him and he could not eat.

Monday night, he came, as he always did, one last time to lay inside the
crook of my arm as soon as I got in bed.  He always woke me if I had gone
to sleep before he came to join me, and waited until I rolled onto my
left side so that he could lay against my left arm with his head under my
palm. If I would fall asleep too soon, he'd butt hy hand, telling me he
still wanted "head scritchin'".  After about 15 minutes of this cuddling,
he got up and went down to my feet to sleep, as always.

I stayed with Felix all day.  In the morning, he seemed so relaxed and
happy as he glued himself to my lap and stretched out fully, that I was
racked with doubt that I had made the right decision.  After noon,
however, his increasing discomfort became obvious.  He wouldn't
(couldn't) stay in my lap because he couldn't stretch out.

About 2:00 PM, I accompanied him down into the forest for a last trip.
When he tired, he asked me to pick him up and take him back up to the
deck, where he retreated into his house (a small fiber-glass airline
animal carrier with a cushioned floor and no door, that stays just
outside the kitchen door).

I made him a fresh catnip sock (from a stock we keep in the freezer) and
offered him a crushed leaf that I picked from *his* catnip clump in the
garden, both of which he refused.  These were his *favorite* treats,
showing how *badly* he felt.  He spend more and more time in the pain
posture, his back increasingly humped, showing his increasing discomfort.
I sat down beside him and waited with him until the vet arrived.

He died in my hands in his beloved home, from a lethal injection at about
5:35 PM. The things that make this bearable are knowing that he had as
rich and happy a life as was possible, there was no option, and it was
not a moment too soon.

Well, *thanks* for being there to hear this!  I had to share this load of
grief, and writing about it has helped.

Rest in Peace, Felix, my little love.  And to the group, Thank you for
your indulgence.

Cheers

  Dennis, my understanding is that knock sensors are ineffective over
 5krpm (of course, where you were interested in making power...!) so the
 knock sensors are basically ignored anyways over that limit and could never
 really prevent you from overadvancing your engine. I expect that some DSP wiz
 will do it eventually, but for now keep your ear tuned and think about
 whether this is something you -have- to have done....

    I would think that two rings would give you positive sealing, a la
total seal rings for 'murrican hot-rods.... just align the gaps 180
degrees apart and you have almost no blowby/leak-down.  The extra area
of ring would probably explain slow seating.  Sounds like a pretty good
setup, to me.
    You probably lost a little power due to the increased friction... 
but did you really notice it?  (Total seal rings aren't any thicker,
they just have funny machined ends where the ends of the rings are each
half as thick as the whole ring and overlap each other.)  I've never
used either setup (if my 914 needed pistons, they're cheap, and total
seal rings are a bit beyond my hot rod budget) so I can't speak from
experience....

Folks,

First of all, I appreciate the help that many of you have offered me in the
past several days regarding my considering the purchase of a '73.5 911T.

I had a nice one checked out by my mechanic yesterday.  Everything is in
good shape: no rust, good engine/tranny, etc.

The leakdown test results puzzle me, however, and I don't know how to
interpret them.

They came out between 6% and 10% (median 8%).  My mechanic said, however,
that they first were 20-25%, but after turning the crankshaft a TEENY bit,
the leakdowns went down to the 6-10% range.  He explained that he was moving
the pistons juuuust enough to seat the rings, and that the valve trains
did not move.  His explanation is that the ring lands are wearing out, and
that moving the piston just a squeak is enough for the rings to grab in the
cylinders and seal better, thereby improving the leakdown.

I've never heard of this before.  Are the *proper* leakdown values in the
20's or between 6-10% ???

The engine has 125k miles on it, 30k since a valve job.  Original pistons
and jugs, no leaks, runs even and strong.

I thank you for your help!

Subject: Porsche Sighting TV

Hey anyone seen the two new (for New England anyway) TV ads which start off
showing a 911 type Porsche (sorry I'm not to good with 911 types yet).  The
first one shows the p-car running down a country road then turns into a Texas
tourism ad.  I guess them Texans know how to advertise, it sure made me want
to go try my car on the long flat strips.  The second one was a Nissan 300 (I
believe ) ad which starts off showing a p-car then says something about new
sports cars and switches to a Nissan picture and bullsh*t.  Seems they need a
real car to get your attention before they switch over to their car, like no
one would look if they start off with theirs.  Funny how they both start off
using p-cars to get your attention then switch over to the real message of the
ad.  But it works until the real message starts at least.  Wonder if Porsche
gets paid for using their image?

This is true, however even Automobile Atlanta says that by fliping a driver side 
mirror upside down it will work the same as the factory passenger mirror.  Only 
the factory may know why a single part was not used for both sides.

On top of that, Automobile atlanta wants $10 more for a used passanger

I'm confused....   When I replaced the REAR shocks on my 914, all
I had to do was unbolt them top and bottom, move the springs over,
and bolt the new ones in.

When I did the FRONTS, I had to pull the struts away from the body,
mess with the ball joints, screw in a very large nut with a 
special wrench, and watch out that I didn't mess up the alignment
in the process.

Laser detectors don't work.  The tiny spot that flashes onto
your car is so small that unless you covered the entire car
with detectors, it wouldn't be "seen".  Users are trained
to spot it at the headlight, so you would have to cover those.

A radar jammer would involve putting a fairly large UHF transmitter
in your car.  People that operate these on a regular basis have
probles with various body parts wilting and falling off.  (Seriously!
It's a major cause of work-related injury with traffic officers.)
Are you sure you want to do this?

But.  Someone out there is making a 'stealth bra'.  Covered with
the same stuff they put on the skins of the Stealth Fighter.  Makes
the car harder to "see" with radar and laser.  Worth looking into.

Subject: an amusing car tale


Well, not Porsche specific.  But a friend of mine told me this last night,
and I was amused.

Apparently this couple my friend knows decided to purchase a brand spanking
new top of the line Volvo - the one with all the super duper hyper attenuated
safety airbags, etc.

A week later, his wife accidentally drives up on a curb at low speed.

*All* the airbags explode.  Taking the dash, and most of the windows with
it (no fooling!).

Obviously, replacing all the airbags, dashboard, and windows was expensive.
Insurance covered it.

But, Volvo won't guarantee the warranty unless the car is sent back to
Volvo for a check up.

The cost of all this together was within a thousand or so of the value
of the car.  If volvo finds anything wrong with the car, the insurance
company would write it up as a total.

Next time I ride in a Volvo, I shall feel very safe knowing that if
any curbs suddenly jump in front of the car, I'll be saved.

Hi,

Love this .. having much fun with my new toy, (and a new hobby)
my '82 924.

Can someone decode the options list for me please :
C51 423 425 461 477 650

TIA 

I have told you how it sounded like harley davidson :-) when I
test drove it. So I said "bad muffler" and went ahead to make a
deal, using the muffler to negotiate the price by $500, and buy
it.

The day I bought it, drove it to the mechanic for a compression
test. In the first 15 mins of the drive (first drive for the car
that day), I heard a phenominal backfire. I apply my newly
being-acquired car-debugging skills on its first ever real case
(other than religiously listening to car-talk on NPR :) and
figured :- air-leak between muffler and engine, lets out sound.
Just needs some tightening of screws.

Also first 5 mins of drive, muffler is cold, condenses unburnt
gas, next 5 mins of drive, muffler gets hot - gas explodes with
air from leak (backfire), thereafter muffler is too hot for any
condensation.  If the theory is right, just need to tighten
muffler - so I save myself some bucks, pat on the back, I got a
good deal.

Mechanic takes a look next day - news is bitter sweet. The
engineer in me is thrilled - since my first ever car-diagnosis
is right. The grad student in me is worried - apparently the
exhaust manifold has a unweldable crack :-( He says $400, 3
weeks special order !!

Luckily located a Bofal (sp?) after-market exhaust pipe, Imparts
had it ex-stock, for $198.  Thanx to the P-files list, I knew
where to look. Pat on the back, its still a good deal.

So my new toy should be on the street before next weekend.

Along similar lines, I've seen a product advertised that covers the license
plate with some kind of laser-diffusing plastic. Not a clue if it works, but
the concept seems sound if the plate is, in fact, the common target. I dunno
about this bra idea -- does a 911 bra really cover anything that reflects a

    "When your 914 trunk lid refuses to open, you can still get in the trunk.
 Open the engine lid.  Locate and remove the forward bolts holding the trunk
lid to the hinges.  The lid will then move enough so you can remove the rear
bolts and lift off the rear lid.  When replacing the lid, align it on the old
paint marks and tighten the bolts."

     If this works, tell the world (if they ask).  If it doesn't, tell

I guess it doesn't matter where the answer comes from as long as you get it.

Subject: Re: Electrical Adventures


The electricals on my 914 are sorted out :). Turned about to be a bad
ground(what else?) and a bum relay.  Lights work, fan works, wipers work, 
signals, radio, et. al.  Many thanks to those of you who helped me out.

a) Headlamp wiring is:  (looking at rear of lamp) 
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
figured out by trial and error:

			 yellow
			 ----- 
                 white |       | brown
		       |       |


b) Wiring 914 foglights for independent operation(thanks George and Dave):
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Two wires need to be switched and the they are as follows:
     	1. The white with blue striped wire exiting the 85 terminal on the
    foglight relay has to be connected to a hot source. (The wire goes to the
    high low beam relay on 70/71 and to low beam on the fuseblock (fuse No.1)
    on the '72 and later vehicles).
     	2. The black with blue wire on the driving light switch terminal 15
    needs to be connected to a hot source. Originally connected to terminal
    58b on the early 70/71 914s or terminal 56 on the 72 and up 914s on the
    headlight switch.

c) Getting into solenoid activated trunk when solenoid fails:
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   (good advice from many here)

   1. get trunk open(remove targa top cups and manually activate latch)
   2. fix solonoid
   3. (best advice:) make a secondary cable release by running a cable
      to the engine compartment should the solenoid fail again.

  The problem was caused(I believe) by the fact that one of the torsion
  bars for the rear deck lid wasnt cocked under the driver's side door
  hinge(the plastic roller-type piece was missing and hence the torsion
  bar flipped over against the chassis).  This caused the deck lid to
  want to fall closed rather than spring open.  Shouldn't be hard to fix.

  I just dread having to remove those torsion bars.  The last time I did
  that with a 914 I didn't get my hand out of the way quickly enough and
  one caught me right on the end of my thumb!  I was cursing six different
  ways to Sunday on that one.

d) What mail from me would be complete without a question?
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I haven't installed the fuel tank yet(waiting on new hoses/filter up
  front) and was wondering about the pump.  Should I hear it run when 
  the key is in the on position?  Is it ok to run it dry?  It seems like
  either a) it won't operate without fuel and b) it *needs* the fuel
  for lubrication and cooling.  Please advise.

Hello Philers,

This morning was a nice bright sunny day. Perfect weather for the Porsche.
Since I loaned my daily driver to my brother-in-law  on Monday, I had to
drive the Porsche in the rain on Tuesday. I couldn't stand the thought of
driving a dirty car on such a nice day, so I washed it before I drove to
work. 

Do you think I need a qualified psychiatrist? Once I started washing it, I
had to Amourall the tires (only for the tires), and then use "Black Again" on
the rear spoiler and rubber bumper pieces. And then I took the sunroof out
because it was a nice day, so I had to "Black Again" the wind deflector, and
clean the area where the sunroof sits. Luckily, I had cleaned the interior
the previous weekend, so that was ok.

Am I sick, or what?

I think it'd be better to say, never do a paint job without disassembling
the car. If you're not going to take the time to do it right, why bother?
The paint'll never look right, and you'll still have all the rust, waves,
dents, dings, etc, of the original paint.

The ONLY way to do a good paint job is to strip it down to nothing -
everything that can come off, should. Doors, trunk lid, hood, and, of
course, engine, tranny, etc. Any rust or questionable areas should be
completely sandblasted, everything should be fixed RIGHT (no Bondo or 'glas,
if there's filling, use All-Metal), then primed, wait as long as possible,
and paint (obviously, there's tons of stuff I'm leaving out - prepping,
sanding, etc). And wait as long as possible before re-assembling, so the
paint can dry as much as possible. Then re-assemble with all new seals,
gaskets, re-install the glass, put the doors back together and on... And
voila, a car better than the factory did, and it will last longer than it
did before. If you're really slick, paint all black underbody areas with
POR-15, and it'll REALLY last.

It's impossible to do a real high-quality paint-job cheaply, unfortunately...

Well, what about using clay and polishing compound on the outside surface 
and all the crevices? And you gave it a new coat of your favorite wax, 
too, right? If you didn't do at least all that and plenty more, then you 
just haven't bonded (much different than bondoed) with your car! :P

I'm afraid that if you are sick, I must be too.  I check the
Weather Channel every morning, then decide if I should drive my
dirty car, or my nice shiny Porsche.  If it rains on my Porsche,
it ruins my day, and I can't wait to get home to wash it again.

FWIW:

   I did read an article about laser detectors and radar jammers in C & D 
about a year ago.  They basicly said the same thing that all the jammers 
were worthless, some even were had only a couple of LED's and not much 
more inside.  Anyway, their reccomendation against laser was the plastic 
license plate cover you mentioned.  They suggested it was well worth the 
$25-50 they went for.  On a side issue, I've been told (by IL state 
troopers and others) that the reason many cops are actively ticketing 
people without front plates is because they are slowy switching to 
laser & photo (which uses laser) and these typicaly use the front plate 
to bounce the beam back.....

     I'm really puzzled with this one. I have a '86 944 and after it has 
     been running for a while (after engine gets to full temp), the oil 
     pressure at idle drops to just a hair below 1. This of course causes 
     all of the red lights to light up. The engine runs exactly the same. 
     No missing or changes like that. With the slightest bit of pressure on 
     the gas the lights go off and the pressure goes up as normal.
     
     I had a bad oil pressure sending unit that was replaced about two 
     weeks ago and I didn't notice this for a week or so because I drive 
     short distances normally and the temp doesn't get that hot. 
     
     Could it be a sending unit that the calibration is just a hair off or 
     possibly (as on person commented) the oil that I am using has a low 
     viscosity and I should change to something like 20-50 weight.
     I could also very easily idle up from 800 to 900 rpm and eliminate 
     this problem but I don't want to take this to lightly if it could be 
     something else.
     
     Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Subject: Laser/Radar Jammers


I'm gonna call this the "Internet Ebola Topic" since there seems to be
a continual reccurrance of outbreaks :)

Ways to "defeat" radar:

1) Passive ... by design (shape) or material ... there are Bra's made
   that *supposedly* reduce the range, but I wouldn't bet my license
   on them ;)

2) Active ... any active jammer is illegal ... some work .. Stealth
   Technologies makes the VRCD which DOES work, is FEDERALLY legal,
   and has been tested by C/D and the BMW CCA Roundel staff ...

   All the others are JUNK!

   You can also build a hi-power jammer which is FEDERALLY (read FCC)
   illegal, they work .. but ....

   (The reason all jammers are illegal are that every state I know of has
    laws against "obstruction of justice"!)


Now onto laser ...

1) Passive ... Remove the front plate ... Cover it with something non-transp
   arent at 904nm IR light ... get a paint color that's LOW in IR reflectance
   at said wavelength ... 

2) Active ... Get some Hi-Watt driving lights covered by IR filters ..
   this was tested by C/D and works ... build a jammer with some 904nm laser
   diodes (expensive as heck!, but *should* work)

All of the other stuff out there is ONLY good at separating you from your
hard earned money ...

Buy a good detector .. a VALENTINE or a Bel ... learn how to use it ...

	I too have seen these "laser-shielding plate covers" advertised 
in a national mail order catalog for about $40 a pair. Couple months back 
I remember a thread about this very topic on rec.auto.driving. I think 
the general consensus was "snake oil."  (I've learned well Stan :) 

	I remember someone saying that troopers always aim for the 
headlights because the radar/laser is attracted to the heat and it gives 
back a good reflection. Don't know how true it is.

	Concerning photo radar, I've heard that when the film is 
developed all the "out of state" plate shots are thrown away. Any truth 
to that... (Don't speed in your home state :)

	On a more serious note, I doubt that they discard "out of state" 
plates because an out of state plate draws more attention to the car in 
the first place. Ever try driving down to Florida with New York plates...

I have a '71 911 T that needs to pass california smog.  It has original zenith
carbs that have been professionally tuned.  I have changed the oil, put a
bottle of swepco 503 down the carb venturis, checked the timing, dwell, and
carb syncronism (all checked out ok).  Spark plugs are new, but as you might
guess sooty black.  I was told to shoot some some water into the carbs and
clean them off (anyone else try this?). I had it tested and it failed.  The CO
was 6.6 and HC was about 1500 at a higher rpm than idle (rpm unknown). I took
it to the mechanic that tuned my carbs and he said that he's had about 4 70's
vintage 911's that he has worked on and none of them have passed.  One in his
shop now has failed four times!  He thinks the new gas may have something to 
do with it.  He's going to try different idle jets. 

He says the idle circuit works up to 4000 rpm, is this true?  

I did notice that a vacuum line that goes between the two carburetors was
unconnected.  What does this do and could it be the cause of my high emissions?
 I replaced the vacuum hoses with new hoses and you can still see the exhaust. 
Going to retest. 

In California you must now spend $450 and fail twice to get a one time waiver.
Does anyone have any advice on how to get my car to pass?  Re-adjust or replace
valves?  Rebuild engine?    

Should I spend $1400 on Weber carbs?  What model of Weber's? 

Any help or other stories about CA smog hassles invited.  How did you get yours
to pass?
Thanks, John.#000#

Hartford, Conn., was taken hiking on the Dipsea Trail over
 Mt. Tam on Monday by her Berkeley friends, Lee Tiedemann 
and Marya Frech. Ms. Tiedemann parked in Mill Valley, 
figuring they'd take the bus back from Stinson, but what-ho, 
no bus on Mondays. So Lee started hitch-hiking and was 
presently picked up by a stark naked guy in a Porsche who 
nodded ``Yeah, I'm heading for Mill Valley'' and explained, ``
Just finished my weekly Ultimate Frisbee game at the nude beach.''
 The ride was otherwise unremarkable, says Ms. Tiedemann.

Just an update on the bumper guard question I posted some months ago.  I
finally took off the torn one on my 87 930 and replaced it with one from a
78 911SC.  The parts number on the bumper guard itself were the same.
Therefore it is still a puzzle to me why there are two numbers listed for
the early SC's and later Carreras and Turbos.  The latter cost more.  The
people at Tweeks did not know.  The person I spoke with at Stoddard did not
know but went to the warehouse and pulled the two and compared them for me.
He said that the inside mouldings are different.  Go figure.

Is this typical of Porsche to make slight variations and charge more?

Subject: 914 plastic fuel lines

	This weekend I'm planning on swapping the plastic fuel lines
that run through the center tunnel with metal replacements. The way I
see it, I have 3 commonly available choices to do this with.
	1. Use steel the tubing with flared ends and fittings (like
large I.D. solid brake line type) and barbed fittings to attatch the
hose.
	2. Use copper tubing with compression fittings and barbed
fittings to attatch the hose.(I vaguely remember hearing somewhere
that compression fittings aren't good to use with fuel lines - if
anyone can confirm or deny...)
	3. Use copper tubing with as close to 7mm O.D. as possible
(1/4" ?) and simply slide the hose over and clamp it like the factory
did with the plastic lines.
	I'd appreciate hearing from anyone else who has done this as
to their experience, methods, materials, etc. or anyone else with
 experience in this "plumbing" work.

PS if anyone wants my old lines, their yours for shipping costs. I
have all 4(2 long, 2 short). there isn't anything wrong with them
besides being 20 some odd years old.

___________FOR GENERAL INFORMATION_____________


In order to repair my automatic power antenna of my 1984 911, I went directly
to the source, Richard Hirschmann of America, Inc.  for parts.

This is what I know:

Address: R. Hirscmann of America, Inc.
          P.O.Box 229
          Riverdale, NJ 07457
          Attn. Customer Service
          1-800-225-0524

They do have replacement masts (telescopes) for the older units (mine is a
6000 U ). No other parts are available for those older units.  They will ship
to individuals with Certified check or Money Order (No Cards or COD).  For
reference, my mast costs $35.55 for chrome tip or $36.10 for black tip.  The
mast is available only in chrome.  They were able to identify the replacement
part Number from the model type of the unit.  The Hirschmann Part number for
my mast is 825.948.105.

Imparts told me the mast that fits the 6000 U is Imparts #477.035.513 for
($32.79).  Is it the same item??  Would be nice to find out somehow.

Hope this helps.

Put it this way:

I am the classic case of a car abuser.  Used to try to light 'em up on every 
car I had every time the light turned green.  Didn't know to check the oil 
until I ran a Ram 50 dry once.  Wash the car?  For what?  Vacuum?  Why?  What's 
that noise?  Oh, it went away so it must have "fixed itself."  Ad infinitum.

So now I find myself with a little rust bucket 14 I bought for $700.  With a 
backyard paint job.  Dent in pass front fender.  Not much left behind the 
firewall on the passenger side.

What do I do every morning before the 15 min. ride to work?  Wash it by hand in 
my suit, of course.  Vacuum it 3 times a week.  What do I do when I get home?  
Work on it then wash it again.  Even though I have to park outside under the 
sap and crap from black walnut trees and willows (that will require washing in 
the a.m.).  Car cover and therapy soon, at this rate!  My SO wants to know who 
I am and what I did with her husband.

P-folks,

I am looking for:

		a) right taillight lens (euro or USA, doesn't matter)
		b) left  taillight lens (euro or USA, doesn't matter)
		c) center rear reflector for solenoid conversion kit.

Prices from shops I've tried for a) & b) range from $80-$110 each,
while the price for c) has been $80-$100.

Alternative sources for new/used lenses would be appreciated.  I was thinking
about giving Doc & Cy's a call or maybe PartWerks in Chi-town.  As long as
their are *no* cracks(read water leaks), I'm interested.

$240-$320 is a bit much for rear lenses, especially since two guys stopped by
my house the other day saying that their roommate has two 914s sitting
in their yard he wants to get rid of for $300. 

(Thwen - you better find their #!)

Subject: 914 CV joint problem - Advice sought

Hi Everyone.

I just was under my '74 914-4 2.0, bleeding the proportioning valve.  In
the process I noticed that the gasket-material-like "seals" (Haynes, p. 96,
Fig. 6.11, #4) that go between each inner CV joint and the tranny's output
drive flanges are "coming out".  This despite a careful installation and
correct torquing.  

I presume I'll slowly lose CV joint grease if this isn't fixed.  How does
one properly install and maintain these seals?

Subject: 911 shocks/etc.

Since everybody's talking about shocks, I have a few questions which have been
puzzling me...My car was lowered about an inch before I bought it.  Ever since
I've been driving it, if I ever hit a bump on the freeway, or even certain
driveway entrances my front tires hit the fender.  It also happens quite
frequently when somebody is riding in the passenger seat.  I've noticed that
the right side of the car is more prone to hit than the left.  Would this have
anything to do with my shocks?  I asked several people that have worked on my
car and nobody will give me an answer -- at least for free!  What's the best
(all) solutions to this?  If it is my shocks, will it be difficult for me to
fix myself?

Last but not least, is there a good bike rack that I could put on my 88
Carrera Cabriolet?

Yea.... Beware of instructions that start with "all ya have to do" ;-)
The problem with switching the springs over is that if they are OEM
factory springs, you must compress them 1st. And you must compress them
if you are going to reinstall them. The compressers are of interesting
design. If you don't get them straight, they tend to be a problem. Personaly,
I have nightmares of the gaurage springs that shot thru our roof when I was 
a kid! As I stated earlier, I beleive that OEM springs are no longer 
available and, if you reinstall the replacements (at least the 100lb 
springs) they require no compression. They just "drop" right in.

You folks will probably think I'm the sick one.  Two months

Not much you can do to stop it once it starts.  Try using a dash cover (I 
prefer the fabric kind - handy place to leave the radar detector under) to 
prevent the sun from beating on it...

Mostly, the new style 944 dashes that I have seen are in pretty good shape, 
without cracks in them... Needless to say, I have a couple of good ones that

Subject: 911S Ergonomics

Hi everyone! I recently bought a 1977 911S in very good shape as my first
Porsche. I'm absolutely thrilled with the car. I use it as my daily driver,
and in never fails to provide me with an adrenaline rush! Two things about
the ergonomics of the car puzzle me, though, specially for a sports car:

1. The car has the stock seats, which are very high. These seats put my
shoulders way above the steering wheel, and my forehead almost at the top
of the windshield. My legs are very close to the bottom of the steering
wheel, and when turning I touch my legs when my hand gets to the six
o'clock position, especially if I need to press any of the pedals at that
time. So the question is: how is it possible that this car doesn't have a
*much* lower seat? Is there anything that can be done to lower it? In case
there isn't, is there any relatively inexpensive seat replacement?

2. I have no idea what the designers of this car were thinking of when they
designed the pedal assembly. There's no way you can heel-and-toe on those
pedals! Can they be adjusted? Is there any other solution?

On to a different topic: has anybody installed a subwoofer in a 911? Is
anybody familiar with the one Pioneer manufactures that goes on top of the
spare wheel (!?), or another they make that looks like a small rectangular
box that could conceivably be installed under or behind the seats, or what
about a non-amplified Bazooka (or any other suggestions)?

My last question is about Driver's Education in southern California. Does
anybody know if there is such a thing, where, when, how much, who to
contact, etc?


Thanks very much in advance. I'm looking forward to exchanging some info
with you guys!

This reminds me of a stupid question I've been meaning to ask.  I

think it would kinda cool to put them on the car (I already put the
H4 headlights back on).  Now for the stupidity - are these lenses

It should be be very smooth and flat.
For flywheels (and brake rotors), I check for ridges by scratching
along a radial line with my fingernail. If there are any grooves
or ridges, you should definitely have it resurfaced. (With brake
rotors you need to be on the lookout for warpage as well).
I agree with the other posters that you should avoid a light
flywheel for street use.

The clutch, pressure plate, and TO bearing in my 911 have only
about one year's use in them but the PO managed to nearly
wear out the disk in this amount of time (I know why, I have
witnessed the guy's driving style: rev up to about 4000 rpm
at a stop, grrrrradually let out the clutch over about a 5 sec period...
argghhh!).  Since I had no problems with slippage, I'm replacing only 
the TO bearing and disk.

Valentines are only sold directly by the manufacturer. I don't have the 
number handy, but you can easily find the ad in almost any car magazine 
in the USA. Pricewise, I think the radar-only model is something like 
$329, and the laser model is around $400.

I heard on this list that Valentine also has a limited quantity of 
reconditioned detectors at a discounted price. Anyone who knows about 
this, please re-post this info on the list. I might get one.

For Sale
- --------

1969 Porsche 912, polo red/black, coupe, ~130k miles.

5 speed, 5-gauge

Body straight, never crashed, 100% structural rust-free (small amounts of
   rust only in lower edge of driver's door, nowhere else).  Complete service 
   records going back many years.  Driver's log going back seven years.

Blown Motor (suspected broken crank right behind rear main bearing, specific
   cause unknown).  Tranny is okay, clutch seems okay.  10k on new
   generator; 50 mi. on tuned ignition, fuel system.  Engine sheet metal
   good.  Brakes, steering, suspension in excellent shape.

5-1/2 x 15 Fuchs clone alloy rims in excellent shape, good Yokohama A378 tires.

3k on four new Boges, 5k on new clutch, 15k on refurbished fuel tank.

Interior excellent (forward map pockets missing - I never had 'em; driver's
   map pocket in good condition but not in car; carpets 50% worn; nice-fitting
   dash-cover in place [been there since I've owned the car], interior
   otherwise clean).

Absolutely everything on the car works except the rear defogger window (and
the engine of course).

Exterior paint is tired but otherwise all there.  No bare metal showing.

In a nutshell, this car is all original, well-maintained, but unrestored.

VIN 129021117; have pedigree from PCNA, original owner's manual, several
   fix-it books (Haynes, etc.).

- --

This is an excellent 912 project car for someone who wants to get into a 
Porsche for not a lot of money up front.  IMHO it's too good to part out.
Literally, this car would be an excellent daily-driver with only a working
motor put in it.

Why don't I fix it??  I don't have *time* for a project car.

$3000 or make offer.  Located in Seattle, Washington, USA.

How tall are you? I'm 6'3", and most of it is from the hips up. My big
problem is that I can wear a helmet in a sunroof coupe. Otherwise, no
problem. The wheel *DOES* drag on my thighs.

There are a couple of fixes, ranging from Recaro's to surgery on the seat 
mounts. I've done both in two different cars, and finally decided to just
live with it in my last 911.

Beg to differ. 30 years of the most successful competition record of *ANY*
car ever devised might be used as a counterpoint. You do have to adopt a 
slightly different style, but it is *FAR* from impossible.

Perry, 
chain of custody is should not be of my concern,I have made no agreements
with anyone exccept the dealer in mention.
I have done my own investigation and found out the previously stated facts of
the tranferal of all paper trails lead and end up back to the dealer in
mention.New research tells me that the title has come back as salvage for
being a previous theft.this explains the insurance companies involvment.
As to holding the title, it is clearly written on my bill of sale of
recieving a clear and clean florida title upon payment in full .my only guess
todate is that the ultimate dealer I bought the car from has gotten a salgave
title, and is stalling to find a way to fix it :says the RMV.
One way of stalling is to  tell me I owe him more money and provide a
situation to get more money at the same time waste time in the hope of fixing
this title discepency.Fact,he has the title.Fact refuses to release it unless
more money is sent.Fact he is lieing out the yazoooo.
He also states my copy of bill of sale was only an estimated cost now and not
an affixed price.I doesn't say that anywhere and was not expressed or
implied.

I have set the state on him.They gave him an ultimatum A)turn over this title
to the state of VT and if money is owed write it as being a lien holder for
this amount he allegedly says I owe ,because holding this title is illegal,no
excuses!! or B) all of his dealer wright will be revolked until this is done.

He has chosen option B it makes no difference to him because he has other
dealer licences available in other states to him and can continue business as
usual only that they can not be on display for sale or be seen making
transactions of sales in VT but still has the power to sign off paperwork and
transferals of ownership because he is still a dealer even if he is'nt in
that state.It can all go through one of his other dealer licenses.

The part about radar/laser being attracted to the heat is completely
nonsensical.  A radar or laser gun is simply radiating a beam in the
direction it's pointed.  I make no claims as an expert in radar
gun technology, but I did take a couple of years of undergraduate
physics (longer ago than I care to admit).

The reason that the headlight would make a good target for a laser is
that it is a nice smoothly curved surface that is facing forward.
It is likely that there will be at least one point on the surface that
has a tangent plane perpendicular to the incoming laser beam,
which will thus reflect the beam right back at the gun.  Which is the
whole point:  the gun has to receive a reflection from the target in
order to detect anything.

It is because curved surfaces make good reflectors that the
stealth fighter looks so bizarre.  Somebody used one large boatload of
computer time (that was a *metric* boatload <g>) to compute the exact
angles at which to position all those flat surfaces to minimize the chance
that an incoming beam of anything will hit a surface perpendicularly and 
reflect back to the point of origin of the beam.

I knew a gentleman who was driving his BMW 325ix(4WD) and hit a small deer.
 That doesn't do a car much good, but unless you either swerve into traffic
or off the road nothing much happens. In this instance the driver hit the
deer and was still in complete  control, However the deer was propelled
forward and hit the front a second time. This time the air bag went off
blocking his view and keeping his hands from the wheel. As he could not steer
he went into the ditch and ran over a rock. The rock ripped out the oil
pan(with integral differential and pass through sway bar) and broke the
bellhousing!!!!   The damage to the front was about $1800. The rock(ahem air
bag) damage exceded $12,000, to top it off while in the ditch his arm was
broken!!! 

           Air bags probably provide significant protection in a heavy
frontal impact, however there seems to be a few trade offs.

Don't mess around with this!

Get a calibrated gauge and put it in place of the sending unit.  Check
the pressure at idle when warm.  Now you know.

By the way, my guess would be the sending unit - always suspect the last 
thing you changed.  But it could also be that the pressure has been low
all along, and the old sending unit was hiiding the problem.  Given the
potential negative effects of low oil pressure, this needs immediate 
attention.

Carlton,

The problem with the belt tension on the 944 is that the engine grows in 
dimension (length, width and height) by 9 mm from cold to hot.

I use the tension tool because I have to guarantee to my customers that it 
is going to work for them on the street and on the track.

I have never done a Ferrari belt, so have no opinion on their tools...

>>> Gabriel Wilensky <gwilensky@gryphonsw.com> 06/15/95 06:46pm

Hi everyone! I recently bought a 1977 911S in very good shape as my
first
Porsche. I'm absolutely thrilled with the car. I use it as my daily driver,
and in never fails to provide me with an adrenaline rush! Two things
about the ergonomics of the car puzzle me, though, specially for a sports
car:

1. The car has the stock seats, which are very high. These seats put my
shoulders way above the steering wheel, and my forehead almost at the
top of the windshield. My legs are very close to the bottom of the
steering wheel, and when turning I touch my legs when my hand gets to
the six o'clock position, especially if I need to press any of the pedals at
that time. So the question is: how is it possible that this car doesn't have
a
*much* lower seat? Is there anything that can be done to lower it? In
case there isn't, is there any relatively inexpensive seat replacement?

2. I have no idea what the designers of this car were thinking of when
they designed the pedal assembly. There's no way you can heel-and-toe
on those pedals! Can they be adjusted? Is there any other solution?

On to a different topic: has anybody installed a subwoofer in a 911? Is
anybody familiar with the one Pioneer manufactures that goes on top of
the spare wheel (!?), or another they make that looks like a small
rectangular box that could conceivably be installed under or behind the
seats, or what about a non-amplified Bazooka (or any other
suggestions)?

My last question is about Driver's Education in southern California. Does
anybody know if there is such a thing, where, when, how much, who to
contact, etc?


Thanks very much in advance. I'm looking forward to exchanging some
info with you guys!


Gabriel Wilensky


- --------------------------------

First off, congratulations on the purchase!! I just bought my first 911sc,
too.  For the seats, you might try removing some of the padding on the
bottom.  You didn't mention if they were the sports seats or not.  Also,
think about getting a MOMO steering wheel (12.5").

About the pedal assembly, I had the same problem.  After some research
and discussion with the PCA members, here is my solution.  The
accelerator has only about a 1/2 of adjustment, so I just tie-strapped a
block of wood to it. Not elegant but it works.  I also glued a rubber pad to
it for some grip.  The clutch is not adjustable, but the brake pedal is. 
Remove the carpet and panel cover.  Both the brake and accelerator use
the same type of adjusting rod.  Its self explanatory once you see it.  By
the way, you should be able to move the brake pedal forward enough to
match the accelerator.  Remember to adjust them so that the brake is just
a little closer to you than the accelerator when braking hard.

Good luck.

I need more info to diagnose this one.  What do you mean by turn off?
Does the fuse in the RS adaptor get blown? Or the fuse in the car?
If the portables are getting turned off, they must not be getting enough
voltage.  I don't how that happens just because you downshift.  Also,
does the voltage of the adaptor match both portables?   Typically, the
cheaper adaptors (voltage regulators) have some small caps.  If you
want, just hang a big polarized cap off the adaptor wires.

Dear Mike:
You can only get the Valentine direct, although they do discount 
reconditioned units, slightly.  I have an Escort and a Valentine, and 
while I think the Valentine is fantastic, there are a few things about it 
that bother me to no end.  First, they use a RJ11 phone jack for power 
connection.  This is a standard telephone connector, not meant to be 
plugged and unplugged daily.  They last about 2 or three months, each.  
Second, the mounting bracket doesn't hold the unit securely, and the 
plastic cracks easily (although the last one I got at no charge, has 
lasted about 6 months).  Third, you must reset the mode every time you 
start the car.  This is OK if you want to use its most sensitive setting, 
but I need the full logic mode, and I have to reset every time I start the 
car.  Even the Escort keeps its settings.
Otherwise, I like it a lot, and wouldn't do without the feature that 
displays the direction the radar is coming from.

Frank I have heard you should never ever use copper fuel lines as the metal is
to soft and can break from the vibration and flexing over time.
I'm no expert but I would stick with steel.

RE: front plates

I have nowhere to put a front plate on my 928.  I hate the thought of drilling
holes in the nice smooth front spoiler.  What have others done?  Is there a
bracket you can install from Porsche that doesn't ruin the appearance (or block
my radar detector ;)?

For now, I've got it in the glove box, but it's probably a good excuse for 
some officer of the law to pull me over, so I don't want to leave it that way.

Subject: 951 Maintenance info

Hello Fellow 'philes;

With all the recent traffic about maintenance costs and the value of the Porsche 
Used Car warranty, I thought I would pass along this food for thought.

I took my car into my trusty Posche dealer yesterday because the AC was not 
working, the right front ball joint was spitting out grease and the sunroof 
would not raise.  All this stuff was OK aboout 10 months ago when I bought the 
car and had a pre-purchase inspection done.  I got a call from the dealer about 
lunch time with the results of their investigation.  Not only was the right side 
ball joint bad, but the mechanic also found play in the left side as well.  The 
AC condenser had a leak and needed to be replaced.  The sunroof lift mechanism 
gears were stripped.  The dealer had to special order all the parts.

I went home and added up the damages: left and right control arms, AC condenser 
and sunroof gears.  Using the Euroselect catalog price listings the total came 
to about $2,500 in parts alone.  Since my car is an '89 Turbo I do not think I 
can use the Euroselect parts although they are the same in many cases.  I figure 
with labor at $62 an hour and a front end alignment I am looking at a bill of 
over $3,000 for a car that basically runs well.  This car is a daily driver with 
only 49K miles on it.  I have put on about 12K of those miles.

Now for the good news.  I received the Porsche Used Car warranty when I bought 
the car last August.  All of these items will be covered by the warranty.  The 
moral of the story: If you buy the car from a dealer, get the warranty.  It only 
costs about $500 and the dealer will usually throw it in to close the deal (mine 
did).  End of story.

Subject: Re: 911 Head Studs

          Thanks to Bruce Anderson, I have the rest of the info from
          the article I recalled reading about Raceware vs Dilivar
          studs.

          Apparently, for the last couple of years, Bruce has been
          getting regular reports of Dilivar studs from reputable
          sources failing while being torqued.  Also, tuners going for
          high power outputs in 911 turbos have had problems with the
          Dilivars stretching, causing combustion leaks.

          The Raceware Fasteners have the proper thermal expansion
          properties, and are 24% stronger than the Dilivars.  Bruce
          goes on, "These studs achieve a higher initial clamp force
          without having excessive force when the engine has thermally
          expanded.  To achieve this result, the manufacturer has
          managed to alter the effective stress-strain curve of the
          stud.  They accomplished this by both mechanical and
          metallurgical processes.  These are a much stronger cylinder
          head stud without the brittleness of the Dilivar which leads
          to the broken head studs.

          The Racewares also have a special finish that prevents
          corrosion and galvanic action with the alloy 911 crankcases.
          Bruce continues: "I really think that these 911 head studs
          will be a good replacement for the Dilivar heads studs that
          we have seen breaking in the 911SC, 911 Carrera and 911
          Turbo engines as well."

          Since the above article appeared in a national publication
          (Excellence, I think), I have assumed that Bruce does not
          mind being quoted.  Thanks Bruce!

          Raceware advertises a set in the latest Excellence for $390.

but have yet to find a supplier, can anyone help?  What does it look like?
Also is this tool good for bleeding the clutch which I'm told is a bear on the

2.  Anyone have a source for a leak down tester and are their major
differences from one to the next?  I've seen two in the mags, one was $50, the
other was $100.  Is there any real difference?

Oh by the way I just bought some P21S wheel cleaner and as far as I can tell
it is the same stuff as Porsche sells as their wheel cleaner and cost about
$7.00 a half liter cheaper than Porsche's.  Same color, same smell, same shape
bottle.  Anyone know if ATE Blue is the same as the Porsche Blue brake fluid
which Porsche lists for $26.00?  My 968 owners manual says to use only Porsche
brake fluid.

Gentelmen-

	I am requesting your assistance and expertise in generating a price
quote for a 1983 Porsche 911 SC.  Here are the details:

 - the car has been garaged all of it's life with only 6k miles and has been
	driven in upper Wisconsin, no rust can be seen.
 - for the last seven years, it hasn't moved...it has become a closet for 
	old clothes (I know...it's a terrible fate).
 - it is RED with black trim and interior....fully loaded with all the
	options.
 - the main crank _does_ turn over, but oil hasn't been changed in at least
	seven years.
 - the car has not been on jacks for the seven years.
 - unfortunately, there has been gas in the tank.

So, that is what I know...when I saw the car a couple of months ago, I
wasn't in the market.  But now I have the opportunity,  and garage, to take
on such a project as getting this car back into shape.  My goal would be to
restore it to it's orginal condition and then decide if I just want to use
it as a Sunday driver or turn it into an Auto-Cross car.  There is no
question it is a great looking car, but it needs a lot of work:

 - New tires, fuel lines, possibly new tank and injection system.
 - the engine could probably stand being rebuilt.
 - the shocks and other suspension parts need to be looked at to determine
	if any damage has been done to them just by sitting there so long.
 - and of course..there will be some electrical problems (Murphy's law).

I would appreciate any advice or tips, along with what price would you all
think is reasonably for this car.  Please send responses directly to:

Well, I'll bet that the _really_ long days would let them get more done
each day than most anywhere else. And although I've never been to Sweden,
wouldn't the lower traffic and population density let them get more testing
in without attracting tons of attention?

If that is of no relief, seek professional help.

The cigarette lighter is a *terrible* way of getting at the battery.

Before I went to all the trouble to build an external regulator,
I would put a better connector in.  Even a 1/4" headphone jack
would be better than the lighter socket; I'm sure you can find
something even better.  What you're looking for is called a
"quick disconnect power connector".

I need some help on installing the aluminum trim strip on my 356 coupe.  
Because the rubber was shot and the windshield leaked, I cut out the old one
and installed a new gasket.  No serious problems, but I am unable to get the
trim strip inserted into the slot on the rubber.  Was I supposed to put this
in before I installed the windshield?  I assumed that it was a locking strip
and therefore would go into place after the windshield was installed.

By the way, the car sat with the windshield rubber just laying across the 
passenger seat and now I find that the vinyl is stained from something in
the rubber...Grrrrrrr.

Fact..... A reconstructed title is worth SERIOUSLY less then a vehicle that
has a clean title. Fact... once that title is marked with an R it is the 
sellers responsability to represent that vehicle as being reconstructed.
Fact... Even if the dealer "cleans" your title, Carfax and a couple of other
title databases will record it as an R title.

 Or how about this. Option C. Dealer has made a material misrepresentaion
on the bill of sale (assuming that your buyers guide and bill of sale do not
mention the Reconstructed nature of you purchase). This is unexcusable 
business practice. Dealer owes you $$$$$. You realy should get proper 
representaion. Either that or tell dealer your plans in his misrepresentation
of you purchase. Beleive me that R on your title was very important to be 
mentioned to you before the sale.

if the owner wants $5k for the car buy it, if he/she wants

I normally respond to people directly with my comments (something

the more info we have on these cars (like a price range) the

Stan,

>Can't get case apart == you missed at least one fastener. Not to worry,

Having read my Wilson book (and having screwed up alot with Type I engines) I 
carefully layed out all afsteners on the table so I could count them up.  I 
promptly found that the Haynes manual and Wilson differ in how many fasters they
say to remove.  I originally came up with 19 and then spent 20 minutes scraping 
away gunk and looking for the last one.  Then I remembered that I had to remove 
one to take off some FI part.  Ah, they are all off!

Then I started searching for the dang metal tabs to smack.  Not as prominent as 
with the Type I.  I tapped with a rubber mallet, and used a brass drift with a 
metal hammer. Crack opened but case didn't separate.

Then I cut some "all thread" rod and two blocks of particle board and using two 
counter rotating nuts I made a little spreader tool to insert in the oil 
strainer, main seal and oil filler holes.  Viola (not the big violin, the other 
one) the case halves now have an open crack all the way around.  But when I try 
to open one area, the other area closes.  I gave up on getting it done by 
yesterday (the day I drove down to LA to do a funeral with the base honor guard 
(I am the commander-type guy) and scheduled a drop off of the heads with Bieker)
so I guess I am just going to make multiple spreader tools and bang on the case 
for a few days.  I suspect that a dowel pin is happy where it has been for 20 
years and doesn't appreciate the fact that I am going to remodel it's house 
before it moves back in.

I sympathize.  My uncle has the same problem with his 928.  The
difference is that he owns the company.  He has electonic security
and several hundred employees.  But, still his 928 gets vandalized
regularly.  Luckily, no major damage so far.  The vandals seem to
be ex-employees, who are trying to torment him by breaking into his
warehouses (whichever one he is parking his car in at the time),
and partially dismantling his car.  It has caused him to loose all
joy in driving that car, because every time he looks at it, he is
reminded of these incidents.

I am in the St. Louis area and am in need of either a complete 3.0 engine or
the bottom end for my 2.7. In May I had a problem best decribed as a spoon in
the blender sound and had the engine pulled out. upon removing the heads it
seemed that the valves were hitting the tops of 2 pistons, so we did a
complete valve job on it but to no avail and the sound is still there. It is
not a consistent sound but rather comes and goes, any idea's? Also if anyone
can tell me of a good mechanic in the St. Louis it would be much appreciated

Subject: Re: Radar Detectors/Jammers

Mike--
I posted almost the same query a few months back. The consensus:
Valentine 1 is the VERY best. Bel 645STI Plus was second choice. The 
consensus also was that if a jammer is legal, it won't work. To work it 
would have to return some sort of signal to the radar/laser source, and 
that is illegal.
I had a great experience with Bel. Tandy Corp. closed all its Video 
Source outlets, and sent a lot of merchandise to Denver for discount 
sale. My son and I bought three 635STIs for $135 each. Unfortunately, 
each proved defective in one way or another (mainly giving false alarms).
I called Bel Customer Service. They replaced all three with top of the 
line 645STI Plusses, no charge. There is now a new top of the line model, 
the 745STI which includes stealth (detector detector) technology, a good 
thing to have in areas where detectors are banned. The advantage of the 
Bels is that they combine radar and laser detection, whereas the 
Valentine is only a laser detector. It is also very pricey at $399, 
especially when you have to add another couple hundred for a radar 
detector. I have has the Bel 645STIs for a couple of months now, and have 
used them on a couple of long trips. They work as advertised. No tickets.

Subject: Type IV Lifters & Cams


The July issue of European Car published an answer in their Tech Letters feature 
regarding 914/4 engine rebuilds.  Excerpts of the question and answer are as 
follows:

 - Reader Writes, "#4. Are VW Type IV 2.0 hydraulic lifters compatible and 
encouraged for use with Porsche 2.0 cam, pushrods and heads? "

 - European Car Replies, "On question 4, the VW Type 2.0 hydraulic lifters are a 
drop in replacement for the 914 motors, but you'll want t get a complete kit, 
including the stiffer valve springs for hydraulic lifters.  Your stock push rods 
will work fine with this set up, but you'll need a new camshaft designed to work 
with the special characteristics of the hydraulic lifters.  The experts we talk 
to tell us that virtually every 914 needs a new cam at rebuild time anyway, so 
this won't add to the cost too much.  You may want to choose a mild performance 
cam, one compatible with the stock injection.  We understand that Automotion is 
going to offer both stock and performance versions of the Type IV hydraulic cam 
and kits for the 914.  Hydraulic lifters are a highly recommended swap because 
air-cooled motors depend on correct valve adjustment for best engine life, and 
hydraulics are always adjusted correctly.  We understand the motor is quieter 
and produces more power and less emissions as it's always adjusted correctly."

This seems like a good argument for hydraulics and I know that this has been 
discussed here before, but I'd like additional clarification from Stan and 
others who have knowledge/experience with lifters and cams.  Is this really a 
good idea for a 2.0 liter 914 ?

P-folks,

Anyone heard of an outfit in Boynton Beach, FL that makes an oil filtration 
system called Purifiner?  I saw an article on Headline News a few weeks ago.  
Apparently, you buy the kit, hook it up, put oil in your car, then change the 
filter and send an oil sample to the company periodically.  But the oil stays 
in there for years!

According to H-news, it is in service on Jacque Cousteau's Calypso (that huge 
floating laboratory), and several trucking companies.

If cost is not prohibitive, would there be enough value-added in not having to 
recycle all that oil to warrant eventual switchover to this technology?  (Not 
that I want to, just wondering. . .Not as a cost- but rather environmental-
conscious issue)

One of the obstacles to overcome with this approach is that many of the additives that are put in oil are sacrificial.  It's likely that they will need to be replaced long before the oil "wears out"

I saw the news story also.  It sounds like a sophisticated version of
the Frantz filter, which my cousin used in his fleet cars 25 years
ago.  The filter element was a roll of toilet paper--you just replaced
the toilet paper, never the oil.  Really.  And it apparently worked.

The downside was that the car manufacturers didn't approve of it, so
it voided any warranty.

I guess if it makes your day to use it in a diesel truck, that's one
thing.  But I wouldn't burden a sports car with more plumbing.

Putting oil in the ground, IMO, is recycling in its purest form.
That's where it came from in the first place :-).

I'll let everyone know how they work when I get my new engine fired up(soon).

During my rebuild, I chose a FAT Performace FI Type IV Cam and the 
corresponding lifters to match.  Should offer a *mild* performance increase
while still supporting the FI system.  I think I'll be happy with it.

Unfortuneately, I had already sent the heads to the shop for rebuilding when
I ordered the cam/lifters and therefore didn't get the stiffer springs. I 
plan on swapping the stock ones out when the time comes for the first 
top-end rebuild.

Could someone explain to the un-initiated why hydraulics ensure that the
valves hold their adjustment?

And don't overlook the fact that, as Listmeister, Stan will probably become

Subject: Re: 911 Child Seats

          Well, I thought I would thank everyone who has posted
          suggestions and offered advice, and then provide a summary
          of what seems to be available.

          Generally, no one seems to have found a US-made seat that
          will fit in the rear of a 911.  Part of the problem is that
          the seatbelts are mounted too far forward, and part has to
          do with the shape of the seat bottom.

          I currently use the type of restraint that consists of a
          flat steel, plastic-coated backing plate that has padding
          and a 5-point harness attached to it.  To use it with the
          911 I have to stuff a pillow behind it to take up the space
          between the forward mounted belts and the seat back.  I
          think this is safe, but I would like something that works
          better.  This type of restraint is offered in the One Step
          Ahead catalog.

          The inflatable seat offered by Imparts looks interesting,
          but is only good up to 40 lbs.  My son is 30-35 lbs, and I
          know I'll still need some type of restraint once he's over
          40 lbs, so this one is out.

          Maria Duryee and Vol Spalding sent me the phone number for a
          dealer (AFN) in Chiswick, England.  AFN told me that they
          sell two seats made by Porsche that should fit my 1979
          (without a 3-point rear harness).  The cheapest is 175
          British pounds, exclusive of VAT.  They said they ship about
          one a month to the US.  It is designed to fit perfectly in
          the rear 911 seat.  It is the only seat available in the UK
          that will fit.  If you want a leather seat, they have
          another style for 350 pounds.  This seat will supposedly fit
          children up to 9 years old (as if a 9 year old would
          actually sit in a car seat). If anyone is interested, AFN's
          number is 011-44-1-81-742-7700.

          Before I spend $300 plus shipping on this seat, I will look
          around a bit more.  If I find a solution, I'll post it.

You have to take their "knowledge" with more than just a grain of salt!

In the very same letter, they state that the 914 motor is IDENTICAL
to the VW bus motor.  And that just ain't true.

     Oil becomes ineffective and not usable for more than the contaminates 
     suspended in it.  If I remember correctly, the thermal cycling 
     (especially in an air cooled motor!)and mechanical stress reduces the 
     lubrication properties of the oil.  
     
     In low stress applications,such as a low specific output, slow reving 
     motor on a boat, maybe this would make sense.  I doubt you could get 
     away with it on an automobile power plant.  
     
     It's a proven fact that proper maintenance, especially oil changes 
     improves the longevity of an engine.
     
     While it's nice to be environmentally correct, I think practical 
     solutions will more readily adopted.

Hi Pdudes!!

I have a small annoying problem.  My 911sc came with a power antenna
and I do not particularly like the aesthetics of an antenna in the
passenger fender.  So, I just removed it and left the black collar and metal
tube in the fender.   Most of the newer 911s have a windshield antenna. 
Does anyone have the same problem? What did you do?

 I know that the VW Golfs that have the fender antenna have available to
them a plastic antenna plug if the owner wanted the roof antenna to get
the GTi look. The only Porsches that have the roof antennas are the 928.
Putting a roof antenna is out of the question.  (Drilliing = eeek; yuck)

My options are:
1.  Radio Shack windshield antenna (foil tape type)
2.  Cellular lookalike FM antenna (any sources?)
3.  Internal whip hidden in the cabin.

What can I do about resulting antenna hole?  Does anyone know of a
good way to cover it (antenna plug?) without resorting to body work?

     It all depends on what's important to you.  I have a very nice stereo on my 
     1985 carrera that have the worst time with a windshield antenna.  It seems 
     that a windshield antenna is not what you want if good radio reception is a 
     priority.  The reception is especially susceptible to areas with tall 
     buildings or through mountain passes.  At first, I thought this was a 
     problem with my radio.  But even with a replacement with a top of the line 
     Pioneer Premiere system did not result in improving the situation.  My 
     stereo installer informed me that this problem can be easily fixed with a 
     external antenna.  He must be right.  Since I put the old stereo in to my 
     Toyota pickup.  It sounded great!

Sigh... Here we go again....

*NO*. Absolutely, incontroverably *NO*. That is the word; there is no other.
**NO**

Reasons, in Four Sections:

Section I: Evil Between The Lines -- What's Wrong with Car Mags

1) reading car magazines where editorial policy is set by advertising sales
   considerations (like *ALL* of the for-profit mags) for any kind of technical
   detail and expecting it to be unbiased and correct is like asking 
   Dan Rather to read the evening news from the National Enquirer. Sure, 
   it's *INTERESTING* but it's not necessarily all right. Not necessarily
   all wrong either, but it's damn sure not all right. And guess what?
   Joe Average will never know the difference until it's too late.

2) these mags are writen by journalists who want to be car guys. Real car
   guys are too damn busy making cars work to write most of the time. There
   are exceptions, but they are *VERY* easy to spot: it's a tech tip
   column, the author is *CLEARLY* identified and has impeccaible credentials,
   and he has no financial benefit derived from any suggestion or promotion.
   In the Porsche world, mmmm, that's *EXACTLY* one. (side story: the former
   car editor for many, many years of a no longer existant major metro paper
   has been a personal friend of mine for a long time. If he was really
   lucky, he's be able to go down the feature list in the marketing crap
   and tell you why a given feature was supposed to be good. Inevitably, 
   he would fail to be able to identify *where* on the car it was... And
   lots of folks lived and died by his Wednesday car reviews...)

3) even if the article is written by someone of the highest caliber with the
   best possible intent (our own Jim  Pasha's work in Execellence comes to
   mind), it still has to make it past the editor. You may not realize it,
   but all articles are but to fit the space around the ads. Sometimes, the
   not-a-car-guy editor will rip out whole sections that have KEY information
   about the caveats associated with other sections, leaving you the reader
   to draw inappropriate conclusions based on what's left. 

Moral: don't trust the for-profit car mags. Enjoy the ads, enjoy the pictures,
even enjoy the articles. Just don't believe any of it.

Section II: I Just Want to PUMP... You Up: Hydrualic Lifters

The Type IV engine was designed to be flexible. It was *NOT* a Porsche 
design, and was really not even built to Porsche specs -- it just happened
to be on the shelf and handy when the original VW-Porsche handshake deal 
was done that created the 914. On the VW side of the house, the target was
to do a couple of things: increase the life of the core engine, deal with
SIGNIFICANTLY hotter running environment (the 411/412) than the Type I,
and provide the evolution for the next generation Type II engine. That's
why the case is thicker, made of aluminium instead of magnesium, has bigger
oil passages, etc. On the Porsche side, that turned to be an advantage 
as it let you put in more power.

The hydraulic setup was designed for the 412, where service was effectively
impossible. (Ever worked on one? I have. Girlfriend in high school had one.
Nice car, impossible to work on..) There was *SIGNIFICANT* motivation to
keep from having to adjust the valves. Shit, even I would lie about having
done so... Alas, the 412 died out, and as the engine went into the Type II,
the hydraulic cam was kept for the same reasons. Now, NOTE THIS: both of
these applications had several things in common: low engine speed, high
heat, VW owners where the motivation to follow the service manual seemed
inbred. We'll get back to that...

What you do when you put a hydraulic cam in a 914 is use something that
was *NEVER* engineered by the factory to do this job. And further, I can
just about certify that it was *NOT* engineered by anyone in the aftermarket.
They just said, roughly, "oh cool -- we can take this part from here, and
this part from there, and hey, it's a 914 hydraulic cam kit!"

So how do you make sure that the followers track the cam? Well, you design
them so that they just do. *OR* you put in *BIG* springs to make damn sure
that they do (which may wear the bottom surfaces off the followers or just
eat the surface of the lobes, which ever is softer). How do you keep the
lifters from either pumping up solid, or going soft (depending on the
design flaw you wish to exploit here)?? Well, if this is engineered for the
application, you know what sort of specific heat you have to face, the
oil recommended, the filtration used, etc and you cope with it. *OR*
you have a part that is for a different application and can't as a result
say for sure that won't happen.

This is not to say that all hydraulic lifters are evil -- if they're designed
in by the engine's designers, and you operate the engine within its service
envelope, they're GREAT. I've even built dragster engines with hydraulic
lifters...

But it very much *IS* to say that you gotta have the right stuff. In this
case, you want the right cam grind to start with, and the right valve timing.
Then you gotta have the right slope on the lobe, so that you don't dig in
too much and cause the internal bits of the lifter to drag on each other and
stick. Then you gotta make sure -- really sure -- that the oil is as thick
as it needs to be, and as clean as it needs to be so that it meters out of
the internal lifter valving just right. And then the pushrods have to be
right so that they aren't 100% stiff so as to somewhat cushion the load
but don't collapse from being overly flexible, and you gotta get the
valve springs right to make sure that the valve closes properly and the
follower tracks the lobe with the right pressure.

No one has ever convinced me that they had all this for the 914.

Now, if that's not enough, consider this: you have a car that is supposed
to have the valves adjusted with some frequency -- 3000 to 6000 miles or
so. So you put in the new hydraulic cam. You're happy -- that's your
last ever valve adjustment. Now lets say that for some reason -- you're
busy, you sell the car, your regular mechanic is out sick, whatever --
someone that does not know that this car has hydraulic lifters is the
next to adjust the valves. Ever look at the specs on how to adjust hydrualic
valves? They're *VERY* different than mechanical valves. And just looking from
the heads, you *CAN'T* *TELL* that it has a hydraulic cam. So it get's a
regular mechanical cam adjustment. If you're really lucky it makes enough
noise that you figure it out before you get to see the next valve adjustment
happen on an engine rebuild stand.

What is it that I keep seeing on someone's signature: "be very happy that
the previous owner took good care of your car". Yeah. That. It's missing
BIG TIME in this conversion.

Section III: True Confessions

Go back and grab the archives from '90, and you see that I come off big
time  in favor of using hydraulic cams in 914. Ease of maintenence. We've
had the pump up thing whipped for *YEARS* in the 'muriken V8 world. The
mags say it's just the thing. Etc.

Yup. I said it all. I meant it all. Then I got bit by it all. Started looking
into *WHY*. Did the engineering work that needed to be done to determine
what was wrong. Determined that I hadn't the time nor facilities to re-do
all the work that needed to be done to get it RIGHT. 

Concluded that hydraulic valves were *NOT* the right answer for 914s. Or,
if you will, that I had previously been wrong. So there.

Section IV: Finis

There is no reason to believe that with readily availble parts that can
be cobbled together that *ANYONE* in the biz will actually put the time
into re-engineering this stuff correctly. That's not to say that they 
might not SAY that they will, but the economics just don't work that
way. It's cheaper to say "so sue me" every so often over a $150 part 
than it is to do The Right Thing.

That however does not deminish the notion that a correctly done hydraulic
cam would not be thing of joy. It's just that about 10k miles in,
it's more like a thing of dog doo.

Save your money. Doesn't do a thing on the street except add weight. Minimal

Subject: RE: 944 clutch

Darren,

I suppose many theories exist as to the demise of rubber centers.  It 
is a problem as, in my personal observations and experience with 
mechanics, 70-90% don't eventually wear out.  They break!

I don't think this is common with most cars, and this lends itself to 
how 944(S) should be cared for (as well as maybe some 911's).  The 
rubber wears out because in its life time it has seen all the twisting 
it can take.  This twisting comes from basicly two things: The natural 
acceleration/deceleration through the driveline and the 
engagement/disengagement of the clutch by the operator.  The former we 
can not (or will not) do much about, but we can always practice 
smoothing out the latter (I hope going through a clutch a year was an 
exageration on your part). 

When we learned how to drive, we were always taught to minimize clutch 
wear by minimizing slippage, or the time that we are on it.  In  the 
small amount of distance it takes the 944's (and most Euro cars) clutch 
to engage, this becomes pretty easy.  Problem is, we got too used to 
the accompanying forward/backward jerkyness that came from not mating 
the revs well.  This jerkyness really helps kill that rubber center.

So, now we have two evils to dance between.  Wearing it out by slipping 
too much, or breaking it by poor, less than seemless, engagement.  I've 
let the failure stats tell me the lesser evil:)

I have a 1990 911 C4 with 48k miles.  I have owned the car 3 months with 
no serious problems (see below).

All of a sudden - driving home tonight - I noticed that the acceleration 
wasn't as fluid as normal.  Just a slight studdering effect.  Very slight 
 - but noticeable.  Two other things:  the engine doesn't seem as powerful 
as before and under hard acceleration the is a noise coming from the 
engine.  It is hard to classify - but it sounds like a misfiring or maybe 
a gasping cylinder.  I just don't know.

It idles fine.  No obvious leaks.  Gauges/dials all read normal.  No 
warning lights.  With clutch in - acceleration is smooth and strong all 
the way up.

History - bought car end of March 95.  Has had 40k mile service.  When 
first bought - had problem with hot-starting.  Like vapor lock.  Problem 
disappeared within days (could have been my driving skills).  When getting 
emmisions - dealer says it failed.  
Found bad O2 sensor.  Dealer replaced under 50k/5yr emmisions warranty.

That's it.  Driving at normal speeds/acceleration all I notice is a 
little studdering.  But there doesn't seem to be anything wrong.

Is it possible I have a fouled plug, bad plug wire, bad plug, or 
something else?

Any help is much appreciated.

The warm up regulator on these cars seems to a constant source of 
problems. My '76 got progressively worse on temperature correction until 
I replaced it. Do you have your air pump working? Sometimes having a 
richer (unburned mixture) in the exhaust can cause backfiring, as can an 
overly rich mixture. The dipstick is inside the oil filler neck. Be sure 
not to add oil unless the level is low at idle and at full warmup 
temperature. Otherwise the dry sump system will appear to be low on oil 
when it's just attributable to the oil being to cool or the engine not 
being at idle.

Yes, the red light is the indicator to tell you that the alarm is on or 
off. THe unit used to be made by Techne Electronics located in Palo Alto, 
California.  Techne was bought out by Clarion, Inc. about two months 
ago (the company only and the name Ungo, not the name Techne Electronics).  
The alarm is probably a remote activated unit which has been their 
common on/off activation for many years.  The "brain" as they call it is 
probably located under the dash or in the 911 more certainly located 
under the front trunk carpet near or around the fuse box area.  From what 
I understand, Techne is still warrantying their previous sales including 
fixing broken units, while Clarion (Ungo) is now manufacturing the new 
alarms and doing their own warranty on the equipment they produce.  
Previous manuals and parts are readily available from what I understand.

You can try and contact Joe at Techne.  You should be able to reach him at
415-856-8646.  

The reason I know so much is because I have two of their recent units
(1990 and 1993 models) and one of their older units (early 80's).  I also
take care of their heating and air conditioning equipment on their
buildings. 

I have had great success with their equipment including the optional 
garage door opener switch that is part of the remote unit that goes on
your key chain.

Good luck.

Mitch:

I own two Valentines.  One's permanently mounted in an enclosure 
against the rear window of my 914, and the other is shared between two 
other vehicles.  I've had to solve all three of the problems you're 
having.

The first one's easy:  Cut the telephone cord and put more-suitable 
connectors on the cut ends; instead of plugging and unplugging the cord 
from the Valentine, you can simply plug/unplug the new connectors.

If you're not using the Remote Display Module, you only need two of the 
four conductors; a simple mini-plug/jack (like a headphone plug/jack) 
will work fine.  If, like me, you use the Remote Display, you'll need a 
slightly-more esoteric connector.  Actually, you could go the easy 
route and just buy a short telephone cord (like, for a wall-mount 
telephone -- about 8 inches long) and an inline telephone-cord coupler. 
Both are sold at Radio Shack.

The second problem was easy for me, too, but may not work for you and 
your car:  Throw away the mounting bracket, buy some Velcro, and put a 
strip or two on your dash with matching pieces on the Valentine.  Aside 
from anything else, this keeps the Valentine off your windshield, where 
it can be easily seen by any peace officer.  This is useful even if you 
don't live in an area where detectors are illegal, since there's no way 
you'll talk your way out of a ticket if the cop sees by your taste in 
automotive accessories that you're an obvious compulsive speeder.

Because the detector in my 914 is mounted in an enclosure against the 
rear window, the button became inaccessible.  This was a huge problem 
for me, since I also run the thing in "L" mode.  A note to Mike 
Valentine (delivered thru "Unka" Bart -- Thanks!) immediately got me a 
"remote button" wiring diagram.  The remote button just shorts one of 
the two data lines in the 4-conductor telephone cable to ground, so I 
built a simple microcontroller-based circuit, spliced into the 
telephone cord, that "presses" the button twice whenever the unit's 
powered up.  If you have no software experience, yuo could probably do 
the same thing with a 555/556 or two.  I also ran a couple wires out to 
a real button on the dash so I could mute the audio when I wanted to.

The Valentine setup in my 914 is ideal:

1.  The detector's mounted where it has an unobstructed view thru the
    front and rear windshields.

2.  It's fully enclosed (except for the front lens, which had to remain
    uncovered for the laser detector), so I don't have to worry about
    tempting would-be thieves and/or forgetting to pull it out of the
    glovebox and plug it in every time I get in the car.

3.  Since it's mounted right next to my right ear, I have no problems
    hearing the alarm.

4.  The Remote Display is mounted right in front of me, so cops behind
    my car don't see the detector light up like a Christmas tree when
    they switch on their radar.

Hope this helps...

Subject: "New" Oil Coolers?

        Can anyone tell me how to get a *NEW* oil cooler for
a 914?  I've tried three *reputable* sources so far, and the
"new" coolers that they have did *not* look new.  How can it
be new when one or more rows of fins are all mashed up?
        It looks as if their supplier(s) are telling them that
there are no more new coolers, and are supplying "factory re-
manufactured" coolers instead.
        Hell, my old cooler looks better than any of the ones
I've looked at!  If it didn't have debris in it, I'd use it
instead of these "new" ones.
        Can anyone help?

Subject: Warmup regulator (was 911 2.7 questions)

A contributory factor to the warmup problem in '76 is that '76 was the
first year of the automatic warmup regulator in the 911.  The '75 was
basically the same car, but it still had the hand throttle (which I've
always been glad to have).  '76 was also the year of the disastrous
five-blade fan, but that's another matter and simple to change.

My 2.7 does the same thing.  It may be due to small air leaks in the 
exhaust allowing unburned fuel to ignite.  I've noticed that mine does
it when I have the mixture adjusted a bit on the rich side.  I wouldn't
worry a whole lot about it.  Maybe someone else can tell us if we
*should* worry about it.

Sounds possibly like your warm-up regulator might be a little screwy.  I
would get a set of pressure gages and check your system and control
pressures during warm-up to see what is going on.  You may also want to
make sure your "auxiliary air device" is functioning correctly.  This thing
is supposed to stabilize the idle during warm-up, so it is suspect also.

If it is not in the tube where you add oil to the tank, then I'm stumped.

Yes. They're ancient, made of plastic and have been under pressure for the
better part of 25 years. They're brittle and can go without warning.

Not to the best of my knowledge. There are probably NOS parts around

that they *ALSO* are twenty years old....

Safety. Common sense. You don't want to run gas through the passenger
compartment in a potentially porous material. Particularly if you ever
have a smoker ride with you. And, if you compete, *ALL* of the major 
sanctioning bodies say that any fuel or oil lines routed through the passenger
compartment must be of a solid metal or braided steel construction.
(BTW, we used to use 5/8" thinwall conduit for the racing 911s, and 1"
for the oil lines. *SHITLOADS* cheaper than AQP, just as effective)

> Also,  different diagrams and manuals show fuel filter ahead of fuel pump and
> some show filter after fuel pump.  Does it matter?

Depends. On the pre-75 914, the fuel filter is used as a diameter converter, 
taking 9mm hose coming from the tank down to the 7mm hose used for
distribution inside the engine compartment. Given that, you gotta do 
*SOMETHING* to make it work. But then, the fuel pump is in the rear
then too... For the racing 914s, I used a Fram HG41 filter between the
tank and the pump, then a "regular" filter at the back end of the car
before the fuel rail. And I get crap in both, even with all-new parts.

Dear friends,

	A couple of days ago I posted a message about the eratic turbo
performance of my 89 951S. I took the car out on "the back roads" and did 
some "research" into the problem. It appears that sometimes under hard 
acceleration my boost gauge won't go over 1.2 bar. The next time I try, 
it pushes up to at least 1.8 bar under the same conditions previously 
(this is when I feel the "turbo rush" that we know and love). What's up? 
Does anyone know what the maximum boost should be on a stock 951S? Is my 
wastegate performing improperly?

	In looking at the past service records I noticed the Turbo Timed 
Valve had been replaced. What's that and could that be the cause of my 
performance delima.

	Any help would be greatly apprecieated. Have a nice day and happy 
 Porsching.

                 FIRST PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT

Coming this summer, there will be new model-specific subsets
of Porschephiles. This will feature sections for the 356 and 928.

Why do this, after years of saying NO? WHy *THESE* models?

1) there is very  very little bleed over from any of the 356 or 928 topics
   that apply to the other cars

2) it's an EXPERIMENT. Needed to be done, given (1) these were the
   logical cars to do it with

3) my filtering technology is a lot better than it used to be.

Here's how it will work: you sign up for either Porschephiles, in which
case you get *EVERYTHING* from all the groups, or just the 356 or 928
groups in which case you just get the material direct from those groups
*plus* anything relevant from the main Porschephiles group. Otherwise,
its' just like Porschephiles.

TARGET DELIVERY DATE IS 1 JULY 1995.

Don't be a dumbass and try to sign up before it's annouced. Sheesh.

Watch this space for further announcements.

Subject: Re: 951S power loss-solution

You have the classic "what happened to the power" syndrone common to
specifically 89 turbos. The default boost for the car is 1.2 on the gauge. In
other words if any thing is wrong it won't go over 1.2. If everything is
right then it will go to slightly above 1.8.
Most often it is the throttle position switch which is located on the
throttle body. This is just forward of the intake manifold. On one side of
the throttle body is the cable the controls the throttle opening. On the
other side is a black plastic device that reads the position of the throttle.
This is usually the device that is at fault and I have found that most
usually it is the connection to that device that gets slightly corroded and
f**ks up the electrical system. Usually wiggling the connector does the trick
for a couple of months and then suddenly the problem reappears. The solution
is to take the connector of and use some dielectric grease on it.
Of course it could be something else but I have had this happen to my 89 and
I know of several others that had the same problem. All were solved by the
method I described.
If this works let me know. If it doesn't work let me know also. Send money if
it works!

slide down almost out of the bracket. The (+) side of the coil was resting on
the fuel line, (that has an inline fuel filter connected with rubber hoses)

Subject: 924 CIS MODS MISSING POINT!

     After seeing varying topics relating to this cross the bandwidth for
some time, I feel it necessary to respond.  Forgive me if this just sounds
like the demented ramblings of a madman.

     It has been my experience that to deliver "true" Porsche performance
form a 924 one must increase its ability to move air not fuel (necessarily)
and reduce reciprocating mass.  I have seen everything from people trying to
use their cold start valve for fuel enrichment to tweaking their oxygen
sensor via resistors, etc.  All of these methods seem to have produced no or
only marginally measurable performance gains.  Bosch and Porsche spent a
considerable amount of time and a large amount of money developing these
systems to perform correctly.  If there was a fix this easy THEY WOULD
ALREADY HAVE DONE IT!!.  There is no easy fix.  I've seen too many burned
valves and pistons, broken rods and wasted fuel to not say something.  I do
not want to see yet another 924 go to the dismantler due to lack of
information.
     In order to gain performance the two aforementioned issues must be
addressed.  Since obtaining lightweight internal engine components can be
prohibitively expensive, here are a few lesser steps you can take.  On my
cars, and the cars of my friends, these have worked.  Most, except for the
major (i.e. $$$) ones yielded very small performance gains.

- -- My exact setup is actually a lot more detailed than this and required
hundreds of hours of tuning and experimentation so don't take it verbatim;
however, for making my point it will suffice.
 
Use a K&N air filter.
Obtain and install the throttle body form a 924 turbo.
Use a mild after-market camshaft (if possible, avoid regrinds as the smaller
base circle causes severe ramp angles and possibly premature follower/lash
cap wear or even bent valves)
     Headers, a header, pardon me, are still a matter of contention.  Some
will tell you that they are definitely the way to go.  To me, headers crack,
rust out, their flanges warp, are noisy and most are of such a poor design as
to offer little or no performance gain for the tradeoffs.  Plus, if you live
in an exhaust nazi state, like Connecticut, California, Colorado etc. you
wont get away with it.  The local DMV barbarians can spot a header in an
instant, but to the other modifications they are totally oblivious, as long
as its tuned right.  I suppose you could have the exhaust manifold Extrude
Honed, I just left mine alone.

Now, if you still have any money left you could have the intake manifold
Extrude Honed and the head ported and larger valves installed.
- --BTW, Eurorace makes a big valve head which is much to the same effect as
the latter and seems to be an excellent choice if you prefer not to do the
work yourself.  I haven't seen an ad from them in a while but it was $1299.00
with your choice of cam, exchange.
     After having gone this route, it helps to use the turbo injectors and
their requisite insulators (yes, the insulators are different, even the
dealer did not believe me).

     THE POINT IS,  just what are you trying to prove.  Do you ask a 356 to
go 200 MPH?  Do you like to build engines and spend lots of money?  I suppose
if you spend extended periods of time at or over 95 MPH like me you may
really need this.  Even after all this I still have only 185 real horsepower
(runs at 11.6:1 A/F  to a perfect stoichiometric 14.7:1 with an otherwise
factory stock fuel injection) even with the lightened rods, albeit a 70 hp
gain, but at a large expense.  If you want to put effective money into your
924, put it in the suspension and tires.  Springs, larger anti-sway bars,
shocks, and plus 1,2,3 performance radials work wonders.  
     In any case which would you like to run out of first at speed, power or
handling?  With the former you don't win the race, loose that pesky state
trooper or dust that Camaro.  With the latter, you DIE!!  If you want all out
speed, start saving for your 993.

Feel free to pick my brain, a have a vast body of information.  Also, if you
know something TELL ME.  I am always learning and will never chastise someone
for telling me something I already know.

Ignore me at your own risk,

A solution to the problem of exhaust studs corroding and breaking that I have

high-tensile, aerospace grade stainless.  A-286 nuts are readily available in
US threads, not sure about metric threads, altho I would expect that Kaynor

Expect to supply the A-286, most toolrooms don't stock it unless they do a lot
of aerospace work (must admit even the machine shops here on the Missile Range
don't have it).  A-286 is pretty much just used for fasteners, so only a

Subject: re: C4 brake startup delay


A while back someone asked about the time it takes for the brake
system warning lights to go out when starting up their C4.

On my C4 the light will stay on for about 15-30 seconds when I 
first start the car; longer if I haven't driven for a few days.

The hydraulic system on the C4 combines to serve the needs of the 
brake & clutch assist and the drive locks. A pressure accumulator
keeps pressure ready, and a pump fills the accumulator when pressure
drops. The delay on startup is the pump cycling to build pressure.
The pump will run any time it's needed; typically depressing the brakes
three to five times depletes enough pressure to cause it to run during
driving.

I was recently sensitized to the brake system on my C4 when I lost 
assist as I approached a red light. When I pressed delicately on the 
brake pedal (as we that are spoiled by power assist are wont to do)
it was like pressing on a rock. Surprise! I stomped more firmly and
discovered (re-discovered?) standard (i.e. non-power assisted) braking.
I stopped about 2 inches from the rear bumper of the guy ahead of me.

I drove the car over to the dealer where they determined that the ABS
control unit had failed and disabled the hydraulically assisted brake 
booster. Porsche, to their credit, fixed the problem, parts and labor
on my 4 year old, 20k mile, car. The new pump caused a hum when it ran
and a click if the radio was on when it stopped. Porsche suggested that
the dealer add an additional grounding wire and the hum is mostly gone.

I plan to install the Valentine unit in my C4 and want it built-in.
I had thought of shanghai'ing the third brake light fixture as a home
for the detector to achieve the effect that Andy seems to have gotten
with his 914 installation.

Does anyone see a problem with this plan (other than the loss of the 
third light)? 

What other approach has anyone taken to building in a radar detector 
in a 911 or 964? 

Thanks in advance!

Subject: LeMans Update -

 Two McLarens were leading midway through a rain-soaked
 Le Mans 24 Hours race, where Mario
Andretti led his team back into contention after an early accident Saturday. 

An all-British team of Andy Wallace and the father-son 
combination of Derek and Justin Bell led with a McLaren BMW F1
GTR with 142 laps, or 1,931.2 kilometers (1,200 miles), on the 
13.6-kilometer (8.45-mile) circuit. 

Another McLaren with Yannick Dalmas of France, J.J. Lehto of 
Finland and Massanori Sekiya of Japan was less than a lap
behind. 

The Courage-Porsche C34 of Andretti and Frenchmen
 Bob Wollek and Eric Helary was in third after a long battle to come
back after dropping to 27th following an accident by Andretti after four hours. 

Rain began shortly after the start of the race and continued, causing a 
number of accidents. 

Just before dark, Andretti skidded while coming up behind a car, 
spun and hit a wall. He was second at the time, just more
than a minute off the lead. His car had damage on the right side and rear 
wheel and lost its rear wing. He was uninjured. 

Andretti said he hit mud that caused him to crash. ``You can't go on
the brakes on that stuff, it's so loose. I spun and hit the
wall,'' Andretti said. ```It was not that hard. We just kissed the wall just 
enough. It just was something we didn't need.`` 

He made it back to the pits, but the car needed nearly 30 minutes to get 
repaired before returning to the race more than six
laps behind. 

Once back on the track, the Courage car consistently ran laps a
few seconds faster than the McLarens in the rain and
overtook a number of cars. 

After restarting in 27th, the car moved back to eighth over the next
four hours. Then Andretti got into the car again just after
midnight and brought it into third, four laps behind, by the 12-hour mark. 

``I was in a groove,'' Andretti said. "I was in a groove all along except 
for that surprise early.'' 

He found the wet track was in worse condition in 
the early-morning hours. ``It was atrocious. It's like a slime, an oil mix
and mud,'' Andretti said. 

Johnny Nielsen of Denmark and Germans Thomas Bscher 
and Jochen Mass led for nearly 10 hours driving a McLaren
BMW F1 GTR and were in the top spot before dropping 
back just before the 12-hour mark with clutch problems.

Subject: Concealed Radar Detectors

I hope that this question is relevant.  I am looking for a radar detector 
that can completely be concealed.  Radar detectors are illegal where I 
live and what I need is a radar detector that is totally concealed, with 
a small switch to turn on the unit and perhaps a small led that will 
flash when a radar is detected.  Usually the sound from the radar 
detector is loud enough to be heard even if the unit is hidden in the dash.

However, the sensor would have to be mounted behind the front grill under 
the bumpers in order for it to work (I guess).

Does anyone know where I can purchase such a unit or have any suggestions 
on modifying a regular detector.  I would be interested in using a 
reputable detector like a Valentine or Escort.  Thank you.

Subject: Re: corroded exhaust stud

Morning Wayne,

One of the old time solutions that was used on 'merican iron was brass 
nuts on the exhaust manifold.  These held well.  If the stud corroded you 
still could get the nut off.  Need brass metric nuts?  Well for 13 mm I 
use 1/2" brass hex and tap them with a metric tap. You can purchase 1/2" 
brass hex in bulk length.  These could be made long enough for your use 
to cover the entire exposed threaded area of the stud.  

I also use Anti-seize compound on all of these studs.  This helps prevent 
corrosion and forms a sealent for the threads that are in contact with 
the nut.  It helps when you take them off.

BTW for those of you following this thread, 8 mm X 1.25 mm nuts that are 
normally found on P-Cars with 13 mm wrench flats can also be had with 
12mm wrench flats.  Check out the Nissan-Toyota type cars.  This extra mm 
of clearance is especially helpful in the exhaust area of early model 911 
turbos.

This valve might still be a problem.
that little valve baried under the intake manifold
is about 60mm diameter and has 3 vacuum houses going to it.
It controls the waste gate via DME signals.
It might be malfunctioning, but first I would
check hoses and connections for good flow and sealing.

(a hose broke of my T-valve, the result being the wastegate NEVER opened
resulting in overboost - DME shuts off fuel-injectors when that happens)

Melissa,

I gather from your userid that you are posting from Singapore...

Given recent reports of punishment there, are you sure that you want to 
break the law?  It would not be nice to hear that a porschephile was flogged 
for using an illegal radar detector...

Given that radar detectors are illegal, keep in mind that there are several 
types of radar detector detectors (units that can determine the presence of 
a radar detector in a vehicle by detecting the heterodyning frequencies used 
within a radar detector...)

That having been said, there are several manufacturers of remote radar 
detectors and several detectors which can be easily modified to do what you 
want...

That's pretty odd. I'm used to seeing valve guides where the bore of the
guide is out of round, but not LOOSE in the head...

Hmm. Sounds roughly correct. I usually press the guides in with an arbor
press and ream them to the correct size, per The Book. Never have any 
trouble with that.

I've got a couple of thoughts:

1) the guide holes are in fact oversized. There's some chance that this could
   happen, but it's not real likely. In fact, there's not even a spec in
   the spec book for checking that dimension. 

2) you had defective guides. That's real unlikely, as the wear would be
   along the guide path, NOT on the outside.

3) you have *WAY* screwed up valve train geometry. That's possible. If the
   valve stem is mainly being pushed side to side instead of straight up
   and down, then you *USUALLY* get oval shaped guide interiors and funny
   wear patterns on the valve stem.

4) your installation was flawed. This is most likely. You did't use the 
   right method. What else didn't you do? Did you check the resulting ID 
   of the guide? Did you check the OD of the valve stem? Did you check the 
   clearance between the valve stem and the guide? Did you check the
   "rock" (i.e. how much side-to-side end play you have)?? And, of course,
   it's entirely possible that you really didn't get the guide to go in
   all the way with the heat-and-beat technique you used. 

Suggestion: just on the off chance that something *IS* wrong with the heads,
send them off to one of the more competent places to have it all checked
out and made right. I tend to prefer H.G. Bieker for anything I don't
do myself. Super high grade service. You get a little attitude with that,
and there are cheaper people, but damn few better.

There is something drawing current. It's not like the electrons just drain

Have a competent shop that specializes in automotive electrical problems
check this out. Hint: it's likely to be some aftermarket doo-dad that was
added incorrectly. I had this problem in my 911SC, turned out to be a
power amp wired directly to the battery that did in fact *NOT* turn itself
off when the stereo head unit was down...

Subject: Braking at track-events

Hi,

I have a couple of questions for you track-gurus and instructors, since
I've been told different things by different people (and read differently
in Vic Elfords book), and I'd like to know what's the best and why...:


(1) When for instance braking at the end of a long straight - why should
    you downshift through the gears (4-3-2)?

    Isn't it better to just (a) declutch (b) put gently it in second during 
    your brake (or whatever needed at the turn) (c) brake hard (d) heel-and-
    toe some revs to the engine and engage the clutch when you're about 
    finished braking.

    If (1) the brake balance is adjusted perfect such that the front locks
    just a fraction before the rear and (2) your brakes can handle the
    heat - wouldn't the downshifting through the gears (and engage the
    clutch) actually upset the balance in the car?

(2) When braking hard (again :-) ) - should you press down the brake-pedal
    40% first and then do for max preassure or should you just go for max
    pressure immediately and as fast as you can. (Vic Elford says do the 
    40% first to move weight to the front - and then go for max. preasure).


I'd like to know what's the best way of braking - especially after a long
brake. I'm having a tough time getting used to braking as late as I should
so I'd like to know the optimal way before experimenting with later braking.

Thanks,

Christian

Subject: Brakes From Hell

Ive posted this problem before with no response, but Im repeating it
again with the hope that I can get some ideas about the solution to a 
really serious brake problem Im having.

Ive got an 86.5 928S whose ABS brakes come on by themselves when Im
driving.  It can happen at any speed.  It starts with slight dragging
in the front and the brakes slowly begin to apply themselves.
Strangely enough, if I sense it happening, I can stop it by pulling
up on the brake pedal.  There seems to be nothing obviously wrong
with the braking system.  I put a second return spring on the pedal,
but it did not help.

I believe this is the same S4 braking system that is used by
944 turbos and 911 turbos, so maybe the data base will be big
enough that someone besides 928 owners will have had similar
experiences.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject: Re: Battery Drain (89 911 C4)

Poorsh,

Like Stan says - it could be an aftermarket drain.  It could also be a 
drain caused by the sophisticated alarm found on C2s/C4s.  There was a 
write-up in Excellence (Aug 91 pg79) that discusses one owner's problems 
with resolving the drain.  Seems a wire from his newly installed radio 
head was shaved establishing a short.  This kept the alarm from arming 
itself properly and imposed a drain b/c all alarm "inputs" are on one 
circuit.  In '91 Porsche changed it so that all system inputs are on 
different circuits.

One other Porschphile (don't remember name) had similar problem.  Let's 
see .. article says that the background draw should never exceed 15 to 20 
milliamps.

The article also mentions that even though the alarm doesn't "arm" - the 
LEDs in the door buttons flash.

How can you test to see if alarm is armed?  Do what I commonly do by 
accident- turn off car; pull handle to open front bonnet; get out of car; 
shut-door; lock car; LEDs flash; go to front of car and raise bonnet to 
remove car cover,etc ; when bonnet is raised - alarm will go off.

Good luck,
Scott (scokelly@netcom.com)

Subject: P club event in Taiwan

Greetings from Taiwan!

I am in Taiwan for about a week for business and had a chance to attend a
local track event that included a Porsche Club time trial/race today (as a
spectator). 

This is the only road course in Taiwan and boy, it is tight! Approx. 1.1
miles with TWENTY-TWO (yes, 22) turns. Imagine a wide autocross course with
FIA curbing and concrete walls and Armco!  The place used to be a tea
plantation, so the locals call a spin "picking tea leaves"

About 16 Porsches were on the track, including 993s (one of them just took
delivered yesterday!), a 3.6 turbo, a 968, a 928 and a lot of C2/4's. It's an
open passing time trial. They time you for continous 16 laps with all the
cars on track at the same time(i know, it's strange). Most of the cars were
bone-stock, and most drivers were rookies. It was certainly entertaining to
watch 3-4 cars dicing on those very tight turns. The fastest car was a 88 911
with a Ruf modified 3.4 (normally asperated). Surprisingly second place went
to a stock 928.

The support race was a FIA Gr. N cars under 1.4 liters. The cars were Citroen
AX's, Nissan March, Peugeot 105 and 205's, Opel Corsas and tiny Daihatsu's.
The winning Daihatsu on slicks turned a best lap of 1'22", the exact same
time as the Ruf. Fast little cars!

I just wish i had a ride... (sigh)

What mud?!  I heard he just came up too quick and stomped
on the brakes and lost it - some of the slower cars are *much* slower
than the faster runners and I just think Andretti totally
underestimated his closing speed (he did have about the
fastest car on the track)...

Ultimately, this (8 laps actually, they were running at around early 4 mins
per lap, up to 5 when it was very wet) cost the Courage-Porsche 1st place, 
they came in second eventually about 3 minutes behind 1st place - the 
semi-works Mclaren with  JJ Lehto won(some fast driving from him in the 
wet/dark - another reason why the Courage-Porsche was second!).

It was a very wet race/weekend, which makes me so 'kin happy that it's 
absolutely beautiful weather today!

Porsche themselves sells decals of various sizes and styles. The race

In '74 (June, I think), either Road and Track or Car and Driver did a
comparative review of the 914, the Fiat x1/9, the Pantera and one other
car.  As I recall, the 914 won on all fronts except top end and 0-60, which 
the Pantera won hands down.

Well, I went ahead and signed a purchase agreement to buy a 73-1/2 911T

It's an Oxford Blue/tan coupe, and has been repainted (same color); the
paint job is real sweet: it was a glass-out job and all the exterior was

I've been a 912 driver for five years now, so I'm familiar with everything

about this lately to become familiar with it.

This 911 I've purchased will be a daily driver, and I'll keep it at factory
spec (except for necessary updates like tensioners, etc.).

Can anyone recommend a book that might discuss "Now that you've purchased
your used Porsche, do this..." ??  I want to change fluids, etc.

I've got lots of little questions that are probably answered somewhere,
like: which brake fluid, tranny fluid, engine oil, etc., to use, as well
as what the proper operating parameters of the car are.  Can someone
recommend a "How to care for your porsche" book?

Mario/wollek in the Courage Porsche would have won, but for the mario
spin, the car ran faultlessly for the whole 24 hours (except for
mario/wall incident)
A
It looks like they could have still won if they had changed tires at 2.00pm. 
The last set of tires were on the car for around 3 hours.
just before mario handed to wollek at 2.30pm he had been closing on the 
lead car at 10 secs per lap. After the change, the porsche slowed 
gradually to around 4.10/lap, and the gap stablised at 3 mins.

It will be interesting to read the write up, could be the porsche was 
gradually dying.

It's a shame that the bell/wallace car stalled in the pit, and the 
porsche slowed, with 2 hours to go there were 3 cars all with a chance to 
win, and it even looked like there would be a close finish

Shame about the Calloway Porsche - how do you manage to be excluded for 
being 20Kg under weight - I should think someone got fired for that!!

The Maclaren cars had gobi desert spec wipers fitted, apparently 
one car had no wipers for the whole race - and they were still lapping at 
100MPH+

For me the highlight of the weekend was changing into dry clothes at 9.00 
pm, saturday 12.00 I changed into t-shirt & shorts, by 6pm, I was wearing 
2 jumpers, denim shirt, poser porsche jacket and water proofs ( and 
shorts ) we still got soaked.

At the race start, it was around 10 deg C, the Hawain Tropic girls were 
there, in swim suits - they must have been freezing.

The sight that got the biggest cheer throughout the race, was the Marcos 
 - don't know if any of you US folks have ever seen one, but they date 
back to GT40 days and still have the same bodey design, and 6.1 litre GM 
lumps.

As of last year, the french have made it an offense to "interfere with a 
sporting event" - you can get jail for running on to the track. So to 
further discourage enthusiastic fans, the marshalls have stopped waiving 
all the flags when the cars come round for the last time. The race ended 
very subdued, nothing like the jag wins of a few years back.

As a final summary, I would say that it was a good race, but it would 
have been far better with some real factory support, we really need 
porsche, jaguar, peugeot, mercedes to make it a great race.

       I have a 993 with 4,000-mi. on the odo. I run A008Ps on the street 
     and BFG R1s on the track. I'm getting decent wear on the street tires, 
     though it's too early to make any final judgment. However, my first 
     set of R1s wore very rapidly on the rear. The wear was even across the 
     face of the tire, but the tread vanished after three track days. As a 
     result, I am having the car realigned to check the rear settings, and 
     maybe to dial in a little more negative camber all around. Conclusion: 
     The 993 is hard on rear tires, and the softer the compound, the more 
     wear you're going to get.
       Anecdotally, I have heard that some owners are getting about 
     5,000-mi. from a set of rear street tires, so I don't think the wear 
     you're experiencing is out of the ordinary for spirited driving. This 
     seems to be the price you pay for driving a truly great car (and the 
     price figures to go up once you put on those new-design Yokos or 
     Bridgestones at about $440 per rear tire).

        Any 993 owners out there want to comment on rear tire wear? There
is a report on CompuServe by an owner claiming 4700 miles max for the rears 
(OEM Contis). This sounds a bit radical to me.

  OFFICE MEMO         912 resto/radio cover plate           Date:  6/19/95

Greetings p-philes
Thanks to the wonderful folks at the Porsche Market Letter, my 912 restoration
program is now off to a booming start.  Over the weekend I swapped the
dashboard, seats and some other interior stuff and I also now have a full set
of the proper fuch alloys mounted up and ready to go...(The fact that I even
found a crack-free '68 dash still amazes me-after I put it in, I just sat in
the driver's seat and simply stared at it...)

Speaking of the Porsche Market Letter-this is an excellent shopper's resource!
 If you have any idea at all what you are looking for P-car wise, it will be
in this publication.  No pictures though-more like the classifieds in your
local paper (or better yet...the PANO ads).  I highly recommend it. 
Unfortunately I do not have any phone/fax numbers in front of me-they
advertise everywhere though.

Now, I have several questions/requests for the list:

a. I am still searching for a radio blank-out plate for the 911/912.  (to
avoid confusion-the 356 cover plate is still available and is a curvy shape,
while the 911/912 plate is a simple black rectangle w/silver lettering and is
very unobtainable)  this is an NLA part, so any leads are highly welcome. 
 
Maestro asked me why don't I simply put some tunes in it? good question: the
answer is that I'm hard-enough of hearing where a radio in this type of car is
worthless.  Besides I believe this 912 was originally delivered to the first
customer sans radio.(subsequent PO put some cheep piece o'shit in it which I
immediately took out...)

b. I am looking for a good shop/individual who will take the time to correctly
paint (in the original color, which is light Ivory) and replace the rubber on
this car.  I am located in the Mojave desert-so I can tow my 912 as far north
as the  SF Bay area, or as far south as san diego, I will even also consider
Reno and Las Vegas and of course any location closer than these points.  All
recomendations/suggestions are welcome.  If you are a shop/interested
individual-SWAGs/brochures, basic information about your shop etc, are
welcome: call the number(s) below or EMail me.

David, thanks for the info:

The only problem here is that the brass is so soft that the nuts tend to
get rounded off. They also seems to swell sometimes, making it difficult
to get your wrench on.
 
I guess this is still better than the alternative, i.e. having the 
nuts permanently bonded to the studs.

One of the most difficult experiences I've had with my 911 so far was 
getting the exhaust off, even with the motor out of the car and upside-
down on the engine stand. I was using regular 6-pt sockets with a u-joint
attached. The only way I could get enough clearance was
with a 1/4" u-joint, which wasn't really strong enough for the
job (the first one broke halfway through the job).
 
For the 911 manifolds, I think that you really need a 3/8" short socket 
that has a built-in u-joint.

Assuming stock CIS induction on the engine, get a 3mm allen wrench and play
with your mixture a little; it sounds rich.  Write your changes down in a 
notebook ("1/4 turn clockwise, Tuesday 5pm") along with the resulting
behavior.  Small turns have big effects:  I think the screw takes a wear

Philers,

I would like to replace the original head unit in my '85 911 with
a CD player. I don't think I want to open the trunk to change
CD's but I would like to access a few at a time. I am looking for
suggestions/experiences with either single disk or multi-disk
head units. I know the multi-CD heads are available from Alpine, Sony 
and JVC. Key questions:

Any recommendations on CD head units based on dash fit and lack of skipping?

Any experience with any of the multi-CD head units?

Can I do the installation myself? (I've installed car radios in other cars,
it looks like the knobs for the fog lights, de-icer, etc get in the way,
do they just pop off?)

Thanks in advance,

Subject: 2.7 five-blade fan

Please forgive me for this group post--I mistakenly deleted the
message posted to me (was in the middle of a reply when my connection
froze).  Meanwhile, there may be others who have advice to offer,
since I haven't done this job myself.

To Ben (who just bought a '76 911 with a five-blade fan):

In '76 and '77 Porsche tried a fan with half the number of blades that
went twice as fast.  It didn't work as well--in fact, I knew someone
whose pulley came off and bunged up his decklid when the car was
fairly new.

You need to change the fan and pulley.  If you can get by without the
air pump (depending on where you live and whom you know), the
single-stage pulley looks neater and is cheaper to buy.  Most likely
you need to change the belt as well--wouldn't be a bad idea in any
event.

This is an easy job for a Porsche mechanic, though I've not done it
myself and no doubt someone seeing this has, and can take over where I
leave off.  For the correct parts at a fair price, without padded
so-called handling charges (they only charge actual shipping), I'd
call Stoddard (800-342-1414).  I'm not on their payroll, but you won't
go wrong with them.

A front oil cooler is highly desirable, especially with a/c.  I have a
cheapie one on my '75 (Rapid Cool), and it doesn't do all that much;
if I had it to do over again I'd get the best system I could.  The
Terbatrol kit advertised in PANORAMA promises to do the job, but I
haven't used it myself.  No doubt someone else can add to this info.

Subject: 944S Coolant Problem

Hello,

I'd like the list's wisdom on a problem with a friend's
'87 944S with 100K miles.

The car is getting coolant in the oil - the evidence is mainly
found on the underside of the oil filler cap as a white scum.  No
oil scum is found in the coolant filler tank.  This began last
year and the oil cooler was suspected.  The cooler seals were
replaced along with the rod bearings.  The car then sat most of
the winter till a track event this year.  The scum re-appeared
and so the head gasket was replaced.  Again the car basically
sat till the track event and the scum re-appeared.  Now the odor
of coolant is strong and after the car is shutdown hot you can
hear a hissing if you listen at the oil filler.  The mechanic who
did the work was present and now suspects the oil cooler again.
I generally trust the mechanic as he has a lot of experience
(including Porsche dealership experience) with these cars.
I'm not sure about this diagnosis though because I would expect
to see oil in the coolant as the oil pressure is higher than
that in the water jacket.  There is some white smoke in the
exhaust under accelleration.  I am suspecting a crack in the
head - I don't know if it has been checked.  There was a
valve job done with the head gasket so I assume it was checked.

Advice/Opinions appreciated.

Mike

     I installed a Pioneer 6 disc changer in my '85 Carerra coupe myself

     this amateur audio installer.  This setup allows me to change disc 
     packs without going to the trunk.  I chose the Pioneer changer over a 
     Sony one due to its slim size.  I needed to position the opening to 
     the rear of the seat due to the amount of hardware near the front.  
     The changer works much better than my in-dash CD player with little or 
     no skips.  As you know, the suspension of the 911 isn't exactly a ride 
     in you granny's caddy.  I found the in-dash unit not suitable for city 
     street use due to this.  Cheers!

I haven't been able to find any real full reviews of the 1.8l 914 in my
searching, but I DO have the factory stats... These are for a 1975 model,
from Porsche's '75 service and training update for the 914...
For the 1.8l (76 DIN hp, 72.5 SAE hp; 125 DIN torque, 121 SAE torque):
Max speed: 107.5 mph
0-100kph (62mph, if I recall correctly): 13.5 seconds
Kilometer - 35 seconds.

Just for the record, the 2.0l: (88 DIN hp, 84 SAE hp; 137 DIN torque, 132
SAE torque):
Max speed: 113 mph
0-100kph: 12.0
Kilometer: 33.5 seconds

I dunno, my '75 1.8l sure feels a lot faster than that. :)

(Amazing the data this thing gives. Even gradient capacity, etc...)

Subject:  CIS &Alternator ??

I recently purchase a 73.5 911 T. I just had a major service on the car and
everything seemed fine except for the cold start. They richened the fuel
but they said that the car was still running a bit rough because the the
injector for the cold start was only getting 10.6 volts and it required 12
to operate. Another problem I described to them was after the car was
sitting a while it would be hard to start again. They diagnosed this as the
"hot" start which is really a valve on the fuel pump. It's duty is to keep
the system pressurized. Well today after work the car was REALLY hard to
start. After about 10 minutes of careful cranking I noticed the alternator
light was on....with the key in the off position! The car finally started
and the light went out with the motor running but comes back on when the
key is in the totally off position. The light stays on with the keys out
until I move the key to the second position (right before the starter
engages)...The car had a new alternator in March and runs perfect once
warm....any ideas...?

	The auto body expert told me that I would do best to let my 914
exist with its current paint.  I think it's time to get it ready for my
first PCA track experience at Lime Rock in  August (I have to call my
rep.!!!)

	What should I think about for shocks, rims, springs and rubber for
my car.  73  2.0   -  all stock, so far.

	I want a aetup that will be good for the road as well as the track,
that is for PCA type driving.

Hey guys,
My vents in my 944 don't seem to aim the air in the direction I want.  
Specifically the center ones, seem to only point up due to the weight of 
the back end of the vent control.  How would I create a more controllable

Hi gang,

I was wondering if somebody out there who really knows their 914 trivia 
could answer a question for me?

I am planning on buying a car to use exclusively for autox and I want to 
race in C stock. I  have narrowed my 2 choices down to either a 914 or 
an 85 MR 2, these cars are both relatively cheap and seem to always win C 
stock.

Anyway, what I want to know is if someone could tell me all the years 
that they made 914's, which engines were available each year, and if 
there are any years or models I should stay away from. Also I would like 
to know all of the "full" names of the different models each year.

thanks
ryan

is it just me or does the max speed seem a little low? From someone else I

enough to easily overcome this. And it's a light car... Does aerodynamics

I would check with your county or state government, or the EPA.  
Another possibility is a regional water quality control district,
if it exists in your area. I believe that in California
sites who handle disposal of this type of stuff (e.g.  solvent, paint,
etc) fall under county jurisdiction.  In Dublin CA, in order to dispose
of solvent I have to make an appointment and drive
about 10 miles to meet someone who will accept it.  Before I got around
to making the appointment, the solvent had evaporated.  Fortunately, it
is easier to get rid of used oil. There is a Kragan Auto Parts that takes
it near where I live, no charge.

BTW, when recently examining a newer Porsche engine case (3.0 or 3.2), a
friend pointed out that they have replaced the old circular strainer
plate with a flange and plug oriented horizontally.  He said that for
domestic 911s, they don't even drill and tap for this plug, that in order to
change your oil you have to suck the old oil out through the dipstick
hole.  This apparently came about because of problems with people who
would drain their old oil by driving out into the woods, pulling the 
drain plug, and letting their old oil spill onto the forest floor.

993 Tire Wear

My experience has been that  993's go through tires like crazy.  My car has
9500 miles on it and it is already on its third set of tires: Michelins
(oem), Pirelli PZeros and currently Yoko A008P's.  Admitedly, I run the car
on the track, but so did my old SC, and the tires lasted forever.  I want to

Subject: Colgan bra -- '91 C-2

     I have just purchased a bra from Colgan -- it is a two piece, for my 
     1991 911 C-2.
     
     I am not pleased how they suggest the bra be attached inside the 
     fenders -- they require that the plastic fender liners be loosened, 
     and the tabs be inserted behind the liner.  After that the liner 
     screws are to be tightened.  This makes for a really messy removal and 
     re-installation process.
     
     Has anyone come up with a better way -- one which is faster to install 
     and remove - in case the bra gets wet, etc.
     
     I have a further question -- as I have used the bra yet -- does the 
     trunk lid section tuck under the bumper section, or over it -- in from 
     and on the sides.  This way dust and dirt will not get into the trunk, 
     but it may flutter.  I plan to test both ways, once I get it 
     installed.
     
     Any words of advice would be appreciated.  Is there a competitive bra 
     which works better -- since I have not used it yet, I can still return 
     it, I think!!!!

Interesting.  I was at Le Castellet this weekend for a Porsche
driver's education event.  I leapt at the chance to drive the new
turbo for a couple of laps.  A truly incredible car, I'm trying to
resist the temptation to buy one.  My C2 feels like a Trabant in
comparison.

One of the Porsche dealers was offering his customers test drives in
the new turbo on the street in the evening.  One of the customers
managed to spin the thing out at high speed.  I drove past the scene
the next morning and the tire marks clearly showed two complete
rotations, right across onto the other side of the street.  Nobody was
hurt, the car wasn't damaged.  Very lucky, it could easily have been
otherwise given the heavy traffic at the time.

Apparently AMAG (the Swiss Porsche distributor who organized the
event) are now planning to ban test drives on the road during driver's
ed events.

Even get this in my 911 when it is left for a long time in a fairly
damp climate (ie. England in the Summer). I guess condensation in the
oil galleries etc, ends up being emulsified when the car is run.

I've taken a two way approach of changing the oil when it happens, and
running the car to full opperating temperature now and again for
prevention.

Better solutions (apart from moving to the South of France) very

There's a major difference between a regular socket on a universal and a
universal 13mm socket. The later is about half as tall and the socket 
portion is very short so you can get a better angle. Buy the best one you
can find so that the socket will hold it's position rather than flop around.
These really work great - just don't try to cheat and use a 1/2".

I also spray the bolt heads liberally with WD-40 or CRC penetrating oil
and go have a cup of coffee (or other attitude adjuster) for half an hour
before I start. When reassembling I *always* use NeverSeeze. I've had
studs come out before, but I've never broken one off.

Since I'm on the soap box - one more thing. I never reuse the head to 
manifold gaskets. IMHO, Leaks here are what cause most of the stud problems
by superheating the alloy around the base of the studs. No scientific
evidence, just opinion. The heat exchanger/muffler gaskets can be reused
if not deformed too badly.

I have a 1980 911SC with an Alpine head unit and 6 disc changer.  I have 
the back seats folded down, and the changer is on the seat, but under the 
back.  You can't even tell it is there if you hide the wire properly.  
You can change CD magazines while driving very easily if you put the 
changer on the passenger side.

My head unit fits perfectly in the dash but cannot be pulled out without 
first removing the dash knobs (these simply unscrew).  This is not a 
problem since I rarely remove the radio anyway.

I prefer the disc changers to the in-dash players.  My changer skips only 
over VERY severe bumps.  The Alpine units also look great.  They match the 
styling of the dashboard well.

There is nothing special about installing a stereo in a p-car.  But, it 
is very time consuming to do a good job installing speakers and running 
wires.

Hope this helps a little.

I have an '80 911sc with about 57k on the odo.  The transaxle oil was
due for a change and the shifting was getting a little notchy.  Some local
PCA members suggested using Mobil 1 synthetic gear oil.  So, I had it
done and after about a 100 miles, the shifting became a lot smoother!!  My
local mechanic also suggested using an additive for the factory installed
limited slip to reduce any clutch chatter around turns.  There are other
brands out there, though,  like Redline, so shop around.



Good Luck!!

How much boost should an '88 951 (Not an "S") get?
I am getting ~1.8 BAR and I it seems odd to see all these '89 and '88 S
951 stating the same boost numbers since I thought that was one of the
differences.  
Could I have a chipped car?  Could it be an "S"?  I will check, but for
now could anyone that know let me know what is normal for an '88?

Thanks!

Hi. Does anyone have a spare untorn 914 center cushion in black they'd 
like to sell or trade? Also an original mirror...I'd like to put on the 
right side.

We have a center console in very good condition (no instruments), front 
valence, a spare black seat (needs work) and lots of other part, 
including Weber carbs, never installed on this car since its FI is 
working so nicely.

Thanks,

Mark

Subject: Four Konis to go ...

I finally got around to installing the M474 suspension upgrade from
Kahler on my '89 944.  Special thanks to Jim Pasha for the news and 
advice concerning the upgrade.  The ride is somewhat "crisper" (to quote
Jim) and handling seems to be improved substantially.  I will try to
quantify that this Sunday at our Lone Star Region (PCA) autocross.

To answer a previous question - Kahler had their Eibach springs specially 
made to keep the ride height unchanged.  The 250# springs listed in
various catalogs generally lower the height by about an inch.

During the installation I discovered a couple of things that aren't 
covered in any of my manuals:

1.  The upper attach bolt on the rear shocks uses a lock nut.  And speaking
of lock nuts - every time I go to the local dealer for these items they
have to be ordered.  It makes me suspicious that the dealer's shop doesn't
replace them routinely as the factory recommends.

2.  There are some plastic pieces on the struts which have to be removed
and installed on the new struts.  One holds the connectors for the brake 
wear indicators and the other secures the wire for the ABS sensor.  These 
pieces are held on by fingers inserted through cutouts in a metal bracket 
on the strut.  A small plastic plug keeps the fingers spread.  Pulling the 
plug makes it easy to remove the part.  I didn't have a suitable tool which 
could push the plugs out from behind so I drilled a small hole (#48) in the
center of each plug and used my smallest bolt extractor (EZ out?).  

3.  When the strut is unbolted from the steering knuckle there is no support
for the knuckle except the ball joint.  It didn't seem like a good idea to
leave it hanging by the ball joint so I supported it with a soft web strap
running from one of the lug bolts, up over the fender and secured to a hard 
point in the engine compartment.

Aren't you worried about lower the car on those control arms? I am.

I'm installing the Bilstein cup suspension. VCI said it wouldn't lower the
car, bilstein said it would.
So far, the rear shock appears to be about an inch shorter than the length
of the koni when it came out. Of course the Bilstein is a coil over, so
there may be less settling. any body else done Bilsteins?

To David Watters:
Hi,

	Non "S" turbos for 1988 have turbo boost of 1.8bar 
(+/-10%) at 3000rpm but then drop off to 1.58bar there after.
The "S" cars have 1.8bar maintained up to 5800rpm. 

Quick check to see if you have a "S" car: on the exhaust side of the 
engine near the firewall on the engine block is the stamped engine 
code. If you have a non "S" car it will read M44/51, if your car is
an "S" car it will read M44/52. Good luck and happy hunting.

Doug,

The Koni/spring combination I purchased from Kahler did NOT lower the car.
I was concerned about this and discussed it with Denny Kahler who said
they had the springs made up specially to match the stock ride height.
My before and after measurements on the car have confirmed this.

While on the subject of ride height I note that my spec book says the
rear height is measured from the center of the torsion bar to the
center of the axle (wheel).  The spec is 3.5+/-10 mm with the torsion
bar below the axle.  On my car this was 4.5 cm.  From the survey we all
did for George B. on ride height a few months ago I learned that my
car is near the upper end of ride height so I don't think my car has
been lowered.  Either I am making the measurement incorrectly or both
the spec book and shop manual are off by an order of magnitude.  If
anyone can enlighten my I would be grateful ...

I just installed the Bilstein coil-overs in my 944turbo- (they go on the rear)
it lowered the car about 1.5 inches in the rear, also put new 250# springs in
the front- lowered the front by 1 inch. Still within the PCA club racing specs
for ride hide (stock classes). The shop who did the work has considerable
racing experience with this setup which is still considered to be mild and not
compromise the suspension geometry. FYI when you put the coilovers on the rear,
you should back off the pre-laod on the torsion bar, since the coilovers will
be working with the torsion bar.

And what a difference!

Even get this in my 911 when it is left for a long time in a fairly
damp climate (ie. England in the Summer). I guess condensation in the
oil galleries etc, ends up being emulsified when the car is run.

I've taken a two way approach of changing the oil when it happens, and
running the car to full opperating temperature now and again for
prevention.

Better solutions (apart from moving to the South of France) very
welcome.

I made one of these myself a long time ago and it has worked quite
well.  I did find one aspect of brake bleeding that is better done
using a spare human to pump the pedal.

At one point I found that the master cylinder began to stick a bit and
cause the brakes to drag.  A few pumps on the brake pedal from a good

Greetings,

All this talk of corroded fasteners reminded me of a great tip
I learned from my mechanic.  In those situations where a
fastener is heavily corroded and the base of it is partially
covered in corrosion (like a pedal assembly nut), take your
6-point socket to a grinder and remove the top millimeter
or two until that rounded off area (for easy placement on the
fastener) is removed.  Now the socket will "grab" the fastener
with its entire length.  This mod helps reduce the chance of
rounding off the nut in those cases where the socket can't
get down to the base of the fastener.

Hi, my name is Dennis and I'm dangerous when I paint things. :)

I had been procrastinating on finishing up painting the trunk of my
914, figuring "It's summer, I have plenty of time before it rains
again."  So much for that idea.  In any case, the recent rain storm
has given me incentive to finish it up.

What I've done so far:
cleaned surface with silicone/wax remover
wire wheeled all rusty bits down to bare metal
cleaned
sanded to even out edges and roughen up leftover glossy paint
cleaned
tack ragged
primed with a generic enamel white primer

Now, originally I had planned to follow up with some near-matching
enamel spray paint (ala rustoleum in a can) since this is, afterall,
just the floor of the trunk and maybe an inch of the trunk walls.

However, I recently stumbled upon an exact match laquer paint for
the color of my car (light ivory, I believe) in the form of aerosol
touch up paint for VW's.

So, I'm sitting with an enamel primer and I want to put a laquer top
coat on it.  I know that's wrong, but how wrong?  if it's really
really wrong, what do I do to make it right?


Thanks much.

Subject: Re: parts

Hello All,
	My father recently reached his mid-life  crisis (I guess would 
explain alot of things).  Anyway, he recently purchased 3 928's and tons 
of parts.  He, my uncle (my Dad's brother) and a friend have a collection 
of 6 or 7 928's between them (not to mention my 924 and an 86 951 and the 
2 or 3 completely mangled 928 frames).  More to the point, they are constantly
in need of parts and also seemingly have an over abundance of certain 
parts.  If anyone has parts they need or have parts they are trying to sell
for the 928, my father and his cohorts are probably a really good bet, if 
they don't have it they probably have a good idea where to find it.  He's 
also in the market for damaged 928's that need a home.  Call him between 
6:00 PM and 10:00 PM  (ask for Walter Garner, mention Shane Garner and 
the internet (I am trying to get him hooked)) any later and my Mom would 
probably hurt your feelings...

On the subject of hydraulic lifters in a 914 (type IV), I'm having trouble
understanding how this would be different from that of the type IV
powered bus.  The factory did the whole package on the busses.  Did
they not do it correctly?  I don't know.  Wouldn't a factory hydraulic
cam and lifters just drop into place and live happily ever after?

I'm interested on this one because I'm tired of the joys of mechanical
valve adjustment on something that is a real pain to get at.

Yeah, but before you punch that hole, better make sure that your filter
is not frozen to the flange... It makes it really tough to drive into town and
get the proper tool to remove it...

Even better tip is to remove the filter first, so that when you drop it down
to the drain pan, it doesn't splash dirty oil all over your clean garage floor.

Pilots say "Checklists are written in blood."  My Porsche checklists are 
written in oil splotches all around my garage...
Good Luck!

Different factory.

Different performance objectives.

Different operating heat ranges.

Not The Same.

However, this is *EXACTLY* why I don't trust the aftermarket kits. Think
about it: there are say 120,000 914 made. Assume 90,000 still exist,
further that about 75,000 are still on the road. How many need engine
rebuilds a year? Let's say 15% -- call it a round 11,000. Of those,
how many are cheap and dirty, versus those who have some money to spend
on new upgrade parts. Let's be charitable and say 25% will spend the
money. That's say 2,600 (rounding again). Now let's say that I have *GREAT*
advertising and marketing, and capture 20% of that market -- I can
potentially sell (drum roll here ----) 520 hydraulic cam setups a year.
Hmmm. What does a cam cost? Shop cost is about $160. So that means I have
to cover my manufacturing, marketing, and R&D costs from a net of about
$83,000 a year. Am I going to spend R & D dollars on that?? NO WAY! I'll
just sell something I can buy off the shelf somewhere else.

FYI.

I got them from VCI in Dover NJ. Same place I got the red caliper upgrade.
Its not on yet, so I can't say.   The bilsteins are a non adjustible
(shock) setup spec'd by porsche. I agree (obviously) that coil overs are
better, although I have wimpier torsen bars ('86) and may end up changing
them too.
There's apparently two kinds of bilsteins around, a road race (not
coilover) and "cup" suspension. The cup struts are NOT inserts and have a
40 mm diameter piston !! The shock appears to be shorter than the koni. I'm
hoping that this will solve the tire rubbing. Even if it doesn't change the
ride height, I may have to swap out the control arms. yuk! My wife is
beginng to think a mistress might be cheaper.

Subject: 944 info exchange

Hi all, I'm fairly new to p-cars, but got interested after driving
a friend's 928S.  Didn't take long until I had an '85.5 944 with
40K miles.  Next my wife just *had* to have one too, so we also
have an '87 944 in the garage now.  Fun cars.

Anyway, here's some info 944 owners might find useful sometime.
My 944 had the fuel gauge work correctly for about the first
minute or 2 the car was turned on, and then it would instantly
go to the empty mark.  The fix was not the fuel sensor unit (in 
the fuel tank) as I and my mechanic suspected.  The fix was the
fuel gauge itself in the dash.  The temp gauge is also part of
the fuel gauge unit, and that always worked fine.  Anyone need
a fuel sensor unit?

My current problem maybe someone has an answer for???  my AC toggles
the compressor on and off about every 8 or 10 seconds.  My p-mechanic
has emptied and properly recharged the AC system twice, checked the
high and low pressure switches, and replaced the temp sensor.  Still
the same problem.  AC runs cold and works, I just think that toggling
on and off so much can't be good for the compressor.  My wife's 944
does the same thing, just not quite as fast.  I live in the Phoenix
area where it gets a bit warm in the summer, but the same symtoms
occur in the winter.  Anybody have any possible solutions I should look
into?  Anyone consider this normal for '86/'87 era 944's?

Thanks,
Terry Henkels

I've actually had adults ride in the back seat of my '86 944.  The
rear seat just wasn't made for everyone.  (The two friends I've
had in the rear seat were each a) on the short side, and b) chose to

Subject: Yellow things (wires and dist. cap)

To finish off the engine compartment on the '73 T, I'm looking for two 
things. First, a yellow distributor cap/cover I've seen these for Bugs 
and such, but never in the 6 cylinder variety. Doesn't really matter if 
it is opaque or transparent. The other thing is sparkplug wires that are 
yellow with black ends, these being either 180 or 45 degree wires.
As soon as I can find free scanning from a reputable service or place of 
computing, I will scan in pictures of the engine compartment. I had the 
K&N waterproof covers painted yellow on top, black on bottom to 
match/accent the fiberglass? or whatever it is surrounding the engine. It 
looks nice... as an uninformed person pointed out, "that doesn't look 
stock now" and I conveniently replied, "neither are the filter covers, so 
what?" As the paint was beginning to chip and rust, it was time for new 
paint anyways, so we went with an idea from Excellence, and it turned out 
pretty nice, but now it is on to other little things.
Oh, not that this car is concours or anything, so lets not hear the

three horizontal bars which mean LASER detected.  Highway 88 has long and wide 
open stretches where you can see for miles all around.  In both cases the 
revenue collector was situated about a mile or so ahead and out of my sight.  
There was a car about a half mile ahead of me which I presume was the "target" 
of the laser when my detector started screaming.  In both instances I had 
plenty of time to slow to 55 and cruise right on by the RC without incident.  
Not sure exactly how wide the laser beam is at a particular distance or what 
it's effective range is, but there is no doubt that my detector detected laser 
and in sufficient time for me to do something about it.  Perhaps it picks up 
scatter from vehicles ahead (Mike??).  If I had not had laser and only had 
conventional protection I would have undoubtedly received one mother of a 
ticket.

Definitely not normal... Are the AC relays working properly (note that there 
are two relays for the AC, one in the fuse block and one under the dash...)

Is your thermocouple to the ac control working properly?

After all, this is a Nippondenso AC unit, entirely...any honda shop should

I called and spoke with the wife - Linda Delafuente. She said it's all
there, in boxes.
Floor pans are rusted. Glass OK, windshield pitted. Couldn't get much more
details. 

I have no interest in this car, just thought others might be interested. I'd
be real wary of
buying any car that's mostly in boxes. But if the price is right and you
have the knowledge it might be a good deal. Please call the seller directly

P-philes:

Recently my mechanic, whom I generally have great respect for, quoted some
numbers for me which were hard to believe.  I asked how many miles I could
expect out of a well maintained early 944 engine before a valve job and
engine rebuild would be needed.  I drive over 20k a year, mostly freeway.
He responded that, barring random parts breakage, I could expect to do a
valve job at 250K and a rebuild at 500k. Though I believe my 944 should go
far, I find those numbers VERY optomistic!.  Any comments or insights would

Well, remember it was released in 1975! And heck, people were still happily
buying Volkwagen Beetles... Which didn't so much have brick aerodynamics, as
a tendency to fly at much about 100mph... :)

I would guess the '75-'76s are a little better, what with the more pointed

to care for your porsche" book?"

Hi Peter,

 Congratulations on your new purchase. The 731/2 T is a very very nice 911.

Several mail order companies (Perf. Products 800 423 3173 and Stoddards 800
342 1414 just to name two of the more well known ones) sell original factory
owners operating/maintenance/technical manuals for your car. You should
certainly buy one of these (but they are expensive - welcome to Porsche
ownership!). For all I know your local Porsche dealer may sell them as well.
Speaking of Porsche dealers... a visit may very well put you on to the
Seattle Porsche Club of America chapter. You should join and get in touch
with other Seattle area 911 owners who own early 911s (in my opinion the
731/2 was the last early 911, but then what do I know). These fellow owners
will likely be happy to have a chance to talk about their 911 experiences. 

Seattle must have at least one auto repair shop that specializes in early
911s. If you  have your  fluids changed there they should be willing to
discuss why they use the what they use. If they don't seem to want to talk
about this type of stuff I'd look for another shop. Again the local PCA
membership may be of some guidance. 

Just about any large book store will have info about cosmetic care. There are
extensive discussions on this in the Porschefiles archives and this topic
never dies on the Usenet rec.autos.misc (or something like that) newsgroup

You mention your 911 will be a daily driver. I'd like to hear about your
experiences driving your car everyday. I hope your commute is long enough to
get the engine oil up to at least 180 deg F.

I apologize for being ignorant about Seattle but if they ever salt the roads
there (or where ever you take the car in the winter)  be very certain to
rinse, rinse, rinse that salt away. In general (apparently there are
exceptions) early 911s contain practically no galvinized metal which means
your greatest enemy is rust.

The only other advice I would give you would be to take the time and trouble
to be certain ALL the rubber gaskets on your trunk, fenders, doors and engine
compartment...everywhere are in excellent shape and make proper seals. I do
know it rains in Seattle and I would think rubber integrety would be key to
holding off corrosion.

Best wishes for many miles of enjoyable driving!

Hi Don,

I have a Colgan that I put on my RS America for track events and
general highway driving.  It is a pain in the butt to remove and
replace.  Mine had no cutout for the license plate (good ole Utah
license plate laws...) so I also have to unscrew the license plate
bracket from the front bumper.  I have a stubby Snap-on phillips
screwdriver that works quite for removing the three screws that
have to be removed in the wheel well.

As far as your question about whether the hood (trunk lid) goes
under or over the bumper section, I supposed you could do this,
but you would have to undo this to open the hood.

I've been relatively happy with mine (it saved my paint job when
a competitor at a track event pinched a corner and threw up

arrangements to meet Ol' Unka Bart, who lives not too far off in Annapolis,

were also to be present.  So last Sat., an old friend drove me from the DC
convention center (witnessed a drug deal go down across the st. from my
hotel; what a city!) to Bart's house, a beautiful place set way back in the
woods.  Made me wonder where he hid the still.  There, I made a *stunning*
discovery.... despite Ol Bart's talk about Green Ones, Blue Ones, Yellow
Ones... what I saw was that he was actually consuming *brown* ones... bottles
of beer, that is!  After preliminaries, Bart, Dora, Asad and lovely wife
Amina, Herb, and my friend Dan and I piled into four cars (!), 3 of which
were P'cars, and drove a beautiful twisty route to a seafood restaurant on
the West River.  There, we enjoyed a great meal, terrific conversation, and a
relaxed time as if we had all been friends for years.  We parted with regret,
planning for another visit during one of my many trips back to DC area.

So, we had a mini Porschephiles convention, and enjoyed every minute of it.
 Ol' Unka Bart is one smooth dude, and lots of fun to be with.  Lady Dora is
elegant, patient, and tolerant of Car Guys' listing their most recent

As one of my other hobbies I paint reproduction leather WWI bomber and

for various sources of Vargas Girls.  There are some books on old

I have found however, is a book entitled simply "Vargas".  This has
pretty much all the Esquire girls, plus others.  The book is 11"x14 or
close to it, most of the girls are on page, some of them two.  You may find
this book hard to purchase, I'm not sure if it's still in print.  Your local 
library
might have it, mine does.

As far as finding posters the only thing I can suggest it perhaps an
aviation museum poster of some bomber nose art.

My favorite if February, 1942 - she was "my first girl" on a 5th airforce

Good Morning Bruce,

In an earlier post concerning this, I wrote that our region needed timing

reliable small setup.  We got a two light setup, start and finish.  We 
later put a switch in the finish circuit so we could easily run laps on 
some of our events.

By adding large tubes to the "eyes" and good driving lights as sources we 
negated the effects of sunny vs. cloudy vs overcast weather problems 
affecting our results.

The addition of a switch to your setup may add some welcome variations to 
your events.

2.5 hours from Rockford, Il, and about 3 hours from Platteville, WI.
Platteville is in the south-west corner of Wisconsin.  We are know as the

	'ROAD AMERICA' is a 14 turn, 4 mile road track with some nice
elevation changes.  It was a great place to watch the 962's race in the late

Subject: My Fault??

Greetings Philers:

WHile trying to figure out the demise of my 901 transmission in
my '66 912, I got a sick feeling:

When I jack up the car using my floor jack, I place the jack on
the center of the transmission mount.  This has worked nicely in
the past to bring the entire rear of the car up to get it on jack
stands, etc. while not being drivable.  When I jack the car up,
the trans moves up vertically quite a bit before actually lifting the
car up.

Could I have bent the shift rod that extends out of the transmission
through this technique?  It might be hitting the side wall
attached to the floor pan.  All of a sudden, it seems to me that
I may be the culprit to my current transmission woes.  Now, I dont
want to repeat that when I put the tranny back this weekend!

How does everyone else jack the entire rear of their 911/912 up when
it doesnt move??  Somebody tell me it wasnt me!.....

Thanks,

 I've actually had adults ride in the back seat of my '86 944.  The
 rear seat just wasn't made for everyone.
  snip


  This reminds me of the time I test drove a 911 down at Big Red Imports in
  Norman, Oklahoma. The salesman didn't trust me to pilot the car without
  him, so he came along for the ride. Problem is, a friend of mine was
  coming along for the test drive and the salesman would not have been very
  gentlemanly to ask the lady to sit in the back seat of the coupe, even if
  she would have sat there or if I would have permitted such unchivalrous
  behavior. To make things even better, some of you might recognize that
  Norman, Oklahoma is home to the Sooners of football fame, college type.
  Well, this salesman probably got his job from some alumnus, as he was one
  of Barry Switzer's (yes, this was back when Oklahoma had a professional
  football team <bg>) finest farm-bred specimens. How he could get in the
  back seat, I'll never understand, kind of like Bart's proverbial 10
  pounds into a 5 pound sack, but it was one hell of a shoehorn.

  The test drive was a blast. Can you say "skidpad"? I knew you could....

  OFFICE MEMO         Re: Road America "stupid" question    Date:  6/21/95

on Wednseday (digest #1494)
Trevor Sadler wrote what he thought was a really STUPID question...
I disagree with that, as he was asking about one of my absolutely favorite
tracks of all time.
Road America is Elkhart Lake.  Elkhart Lake is in Wisconsin-a little bit
further north of Sheboygan, which in turn, is several hours north of Chicago.
The track itself is a beautiful four-mile course set in the equally
intoxicating Kettle Moraine countryside.

As a member of the Chicago Region SCCA, I was a timer/scorer there in the 70's
for the June Sprints, Trans-Ams and the "real"Can-Ams.  
Believe me, It was instant religion hearing 25+ Can-Am cars on the pace
lap-most of them Traco Chevy powered, with the first of the "917 class"
Porsches adding their demonic screech to the thunder.  A sound that will never
be repeated-even in vintage racing, simply because there were no holds barred
then...

I guess the best look you can get of the culture of Road America now is to get
to the June Sprints-which I guess is still a SCCA National event (it's been
many years-sorry, I live out in the Mojave desert now).  People have called
the sprints the "woodstock" of sports car racing.  this isn't far from the
truth-not far at all...
The Sprints is nothing but people, color, cars, lots of loud engines echoing
through the trees and more people.  the Sprints are a real tradition that any
sports car/racing fan really needs to experience at least once...I don't know
what other events are held there, besides the indy car circus stopping there. 
When Clift Tufte owned the place it was the same  three gigs each and every
summer: June Sprints, Trans-Am, Can-Am; next summer repeat, and so on...
Corn-on the-cob, cold beer, beer-soaked Bratwurst, midwestern summer nights,
more cold beer, meeting the girls...

And a whole lotta Porsches!  In fact I very clearly remember someone showing
up in the paddock with a 550A Spyder w/ Wisconsin street tags that said "D
550".  (or something to that effect-I have a very nice color photo of that
car, among others...)  Back then, the Porsche guys had a special parking area
called the "porsche paddock", far, far away from the corvette guys with their
"corvette corral"

Needless to say, it was all lotsa fun then...I'm sure it still is. 
(suggestion: call Road & Track's Peter Egan and ask about Elkhart, He'll wax
poetic for days!)
Go there. Do it...

Subject: '89 951 Brake System Questions

Hello All;

I have a question about the brake system on the '89 944 Turbo models.  Is there 
some kind of pressure reservior mechanism the keeps the brake pressure up for 
the power assist function?  If so, where is it located and how can it be 
inspected?

The reason I ask is that the brakes on my 951 feel like there is no power assist 
to them.  I have put in new pads (Metalmasters) and bled the system but I still 
do not have a real firm pedal.  There feels like a few inches of pedal travel 
before the car starts slowing down.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I guess I will see some of you at the PCA Club Race at Summit Point on Friday 
and Saturday.  I will be watching and working if needed, not competing.  TIA

Subject: Re: corroded exhaust stud

Re: to Wayne Flowers' suggestion to have a new set made out of stainless -
according to Carroll's "Nuts, bolts, and fasteners" (I like Stan's alias,
"Screw to Win"), stainless has galling problems when used with aluminum.
Also, by having the threads cut into the stud instead of a factory "rolled"
thread, the fastener is made much weaker.

My solution: use the correct studs (most Porsche repair places should have
a good stock).  Use the correct nuts (I think they were all copper - don't
remember for sure).  Use anti-seize on the threads so you might actually get
the exchangers off a second time.  Torque them to spec.  Torque them again
with the exhaust hot.

When I put on SSI exchangers, fully half of the studs came out (most fused to
their nuts) - didn't break a one.  One of the studs had been replaced with
a bolt ;-) and there were at least two varieties of nuts.

I would suggest carefully checking the vacuum supply to the 
brake booster servo, located between firewall and master cylinder.
it could be a pluged or broken line or a blockage in the 
booseters inlet or even outlet.
(boosters don't fail very often themselves)
It is possible that there is air in system or the master cylindar is
failing also.

The power assist for all 944 cars is the vacuum brake booster, which is 
located between the brake master cylinder and the firewall.  It is a large 
(12-14 inches in diameter) black thingy with a vacuum line attached to the 
passenger side front of the thingy (sorry to not be properly EEC and metric 
in my specifications...)

If you're not getting any brake assist, it could be that there is a vacuum 
leak between the intake manifold and the booster. Check it out...

You may have to re-bleed the brakes until your brakes start feeling better...

The brake booster tends to make the brake pedal feel softer, not firmer...
As far as that goes, I have not yet driven a 944 with the same hard pedal 
feel that I get out of a 911.  I chased mine for a couple of weeks (trying 
all of the various fixes) until I realized that the brakes were just fine 
and it was my head that was screwed up...

Try another 944 before you condemn the brakes on yours...

That's great you got a warning so far in advance of the speed trap.
With all of the information I have gotten from Porschephiles, I decided
to go with the Valentine detector (with laser).  It sounds like the best
unit available.

As far as the width of the laser goes, I was told by my father that the
published specs on the lasers used by police list a beam divergence of
6 feet at 1000 feet distance.  With some trigonometry, that works out
to be .34 degrees of divergence.  So, at 1 mile, the area covered by
the laser would be 32 feet.  You may have picked up a direct signal at
one mile, but it would have been VERY weak.  If so, that's another good
testament for the Valentine.

The answers generally suspect the oil cooler seals.  I'm sure it
is getting hot enough to bake off any moisture in the oil - it is
a 2 hr drive to the track and a very hot weekend.  One person
mentioned an oil cooler housing modification.  Is this a well
known modification and what is it?

The car is using coolant at about 1 qt/150 miles.  There is also smoke in the  
exhaust.  It is strange, there must be coolant in the oil because the
breather has a lot of greenish white scum, but no coolant smell is
noticable on the dipstick.  I'd think oil would be in the coolant if the
oil cooler failed and I don't see/smell any.

Any further opinions/advice?

well as being discussed here, I thought I would add a comment.

Am I the only one who thinks that the wheels look VERY similar to the wheels
on the new Ford Probe? I realize that the wheels are manufactured completely
differently, and I have no doubt that the Porsche wheels are superior, but
they really do look quite similar.

Subject: Re: SS fasteners

Stainless only has a galling problem with aluminum in those cases where 
there is frequent assembly/disassembly without a thread lub.  In the case
of exhaust studs this is pretty much a one-off deal and I have never seen
a galling problem in this sort of application.  Use some Silver Goop
from the Swagelok Fitting suppliers (found in major cities) as a thread
lub between the studs and the block, and the nuts and the studs.  The
tensile difference between a cut and rolled thread is minuscule compared
to that between unrusted studs and those rusted halfway through.  The 
main problem with cut studs is that stress cracks are more likely - but
this is only a problem in high stress situations.  Holding headers on
is not a high-stress apllication, but for connecting rods, or attaching 
jet engines or rocket motors then one would specify rolled threads.

I have used stainless metric studs from Metric and Multistandard
Components Corp. in the past, and my reccollection is that they
were rolled thread.  They have both 304 and 316 alloys available,
not as good as A-286, but their prices are reasonable.

Some of the MS/NAS fasteners are pretty snazzy - rolled threads, head
undersurfaces ground and filletted, individual zyglo tested, 12pt
heads, A286 alloy.  And expensive, wow!  Big problem is  getting this
quality fastener in metric.

I'm not up on this _particular_ distributor, but there are generally two
kinds of Bosch caps, those with the locating "key" and those without.  I've
seen both kinds, on both 4- and 6-cylinder Bosch distributors. Most of the
6-cylinder caps I've seen are as you describe (no key).

If you have a mismatch (as you do, where the cap is missing what you call
the "key") you can obtain or fabricate a Bosch distributor part which is
essentially a small, bent piece of thick sheet metal that attaches under
one of the distributor clip holder screws.  It's curved to fit the
distributor body, etc. This provides a metal "tang" that sticks up above
the surface of the distributor body and will locate the cap nicely. 

If the cap for your distributor has the same "base circle" size as that of,
say, the '74 914-4 2.0, you should be able to find 6-cyl caps in both
styles, both with and without the key -- I've certainly seen both. If it's
the bigger size cap, I don't know, but BMW has used both sizes and Mercedes
used the small size, so you might want to cross-check there.

I had such a distributor/cap mismatch, and a garage was able to provide me
with the little part (proper Bosch) I mentioned above.

  Use anti-seize on the threads so you might actually get
the exchangers off a second time.  Torque them to spec.  Torque them again
with the exhaust hot.

When I put on SSI exchangers, fully half of the studs came out (most fused to
their nuts) - didn't break a one.  One of the studs had been replaced with
a bolt ;-) and there were at least two varieties of nuts.

*************************

The anti-seize a good idea.  However, there is a generic method
of removing exhaust fastners that I've never had fail.

Spray each fastner with liquid wrench *every day* for about 
*one week* before attempting removal.  Generally a day or two is 
enough time but 2 hours isn't.

Pound each nut a few times while you're in there.

With this treatment, stuff generally just comes off with no fuss.

Oh yeah, the bad part: don't drive the car during this time.

Well, that little tidbit of additional information seems to indicate a bad

gave me a small container of some penetrating oil. He told me that the stuff
 makes WD-40 look like water. His instructions were to aply a little to each
nut and let sit overnite and wait for the magic. Of course I looked at him
and said, yeah right. Well, I tried the stuff out, (smells awful),  I came

5 of the 12 nuts were hand loose. The stuff is simply amazing.  If any one is

Hi all,
I'm backdating the exhaust on my '77 911 to the pre '74 exhaust.
In this way I will hopefully gain some HP's (Anybody knows how many?).

However I've been told that this should be an easy fix where the
main problem would be to remove the old rusty exhaust as discussed 
here recently.

But is there ever an easy fix???
                     ====

Yesterday as I had removed the old exhaust and was in order to mount the
older type of heat exchangers, I discovered a not foreseen problem!!!
The problem is that the older type of heat exchangers doesn't fit 
because an oil line is in the way!!!
The oil line is going from the left side of the engine towards
the rear and then round the rear of the car, through a
rubber hose on the right side of the car, and then into the oil cooler.

Does anybody know how this oil line was mounted on the pre '74 911's ?
Is there a factory replacement part or do I have to reconstruct
the oil line myself ?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Subject: 993 tire wear

OEM Continental rears are at 5,000 miles and already I am shopping for
new ones (of a different brand).  These are street tires with two
sort-of track days. I didn't run it hard either day - and it still beat
my '77 with 3.2 motor and 7 years of track development and some spirited
track driving.  The 993 beat it by a second and I was trying to make
sure the tires didn't squeal.  This result gives mixed emotions.  Am I
glad the 993 beat it so easily or just a little disappointed that all of
that effort and money in the '77 was trumped so easily?  Philosophy was
never a strong suit.  I have heard the Yokohama AVS are recommended for
the rear. They may not be better for the track but I understand they
last longer and I have to drive it everyday.
Anyone want to buy an extra 993 rear wheel?  A '77 2.7 CIS air pump?
Complete front and rear bumpers from a 911 SC?  A cat?

RE: a/c compressor cycle 'problem'

I believe that the a/c is supposed to cycle on and off.
The system on a great many other autos do it as well.
(my ac cycled when I lived in Phoenix and when i was in Alberta)

there is a resivoir that is filled (accumulator) with liquid
refrigerant (R-12) and the compressor turns off when it is 'full'.
and then comes on again when 'low'.  
also the system is designed to 
keep the evaporator (under dash) from droping below about 1c 34F so
ice doesn't form.

Hope that helps

You may rember that Milwaukee is the home of Excellent Beer.

	The track phone number is 1-800-365-RACE.

July  7- 9:	Indy Cars, Texaco/Havoline 200

July 21-23:	Historic Races, Presented by the COMO Inn

August 4- 6:	US Motorcycle Grand Prix

Labor Day Week End:  I think this will be a PORSCHE club race week end.


IMSA no longer has a race at RA.  I attended the last IMSA race at RA.  The
attendance was less than the Historic Car race week end.  A 962 won the race.

Now that everyone knows where Road America is, you may have a chance to drive
your car there!
The Nord Stern Chapter of the PCA is hosting a track event on July 13 and 14
at RA. There is room for 120 drivers, but I don't know how many have signed
up yet. I do know of one cancellation - my brother in-law challenged a
retaining wall with his 76 Carrera in Kansas and won't be going to RA as
planned :(

If you are interested and have approved driver's education experience, call
our eventmeister - Bruce Boeder
612-593-5544 to see if there are still open spots. Cost is $175. P.S. We

If there is a 45 mph limit it is probably there for a good reason - why

          I've got 12K on my 993 now. When I changed the oil and 
          filter at 7300 miles ($240!!!!), the dealer recommended 
          replacing the rears (Dunlop SP-8000).  Unfortunately they 
          were on backorder and I didn't get them until I had 10,700 
          miles on the car ( and one flat later).
          
          This car is such a kick to drive, those rears have to take a 
          beating. Any guesses on rear tire life for the twin turbo? 
          It probably says in the owner's manual: "at each 
          fillup,check the oil level and rear tread for excessive 
          wear. Replace the rear tires if necessary."  ;-)

Many people have said in magazines and such that the 'early' (up 'til '73 
when all the electronics came along, '73 incl, BTW) 911's will become 
collectable cars in the next 5 years as they all become 25 years old. The 
ones most worth keeping are good, mostly original, 911 T,E,S (the others 
already know they are something) I would keep the bumpers if I were you. 
On another note, some of the E and S 911's of that period had a tendency 
to self destruct their engines because of too high compression, leaving 
only T's behind... Keep in mind too, that T's are the lowest of the 
bunch, and therefore are the most affordable 911 a person can get (well, 
excluding Oklahoma Foreign's specials on rollovers and such)

That's a good point, and I agree with you, but sometimes with these
fine cars, you tend to not realize how fast you're going until you look

Yeah, I know the short life of an RJ-11 jack seems like an "obvious 
flaw", but there really isn't another solution that's any better for 
the average Valentine user.

The RJ-11 phone jack has two very large advantages:

    1.  It's the only 4-wire connector in real common use, so it's
        cheap.
    2.  When a user needs a custom-length power cord, he can get one at
        any hardware or electronics store.  This is much nicer than
        having to cut the old connectors off the power cord, buy wire,
        solder the new wire to the old connectors, etc.

I can't think of another 4-wire connector, as commonly-available as 
RJ-11,  that would be more reliable.  Do you have any ideas?

Subject: Re: Fitting of pre '74 exhaust

Just finished installing SSI (pre '74) exhaust on my 1975 911s. Yes you do need 
two new oil lines, one metal line which goes from the fitting on the drivers 
side of the engine around to near the oil cooler on the passenger side, and then 
a second line which mates up to the oil thermostat in the passenger rear fender 
well. 

Both of these are readily available, I am surprised that the seller of your 
exhaust didn't tell you that they were necessary. The cost (oem) is about $159 
in Excellence.

You also need to remove the air injection system and plug the rotten little 
holes in the head. The thread is M10 x 1mm which is hard to find. I took some 
bolts, cut the tips off into plugs and hacksawed as screwdriver slot into them, 
then loctited them into the holes. (PS to all...was this a nutty or unnecessary 
move??).

I didn't have any trouble removing the old ones as they were essentially new 
when I replaced my 2.7 with a Kremer built 3.2. Replacing the nuts is tough as 
you really need a wobble socket fitting as you need to torque them to about 17 
ft lbs, while placing them at an slight angle to get around the actual 
exchanger.

Oh yes, you probably need to buy some of the new type heater hoses to mate up to 
your existing system, I haven't go mine in yet as they seem too bloody long, but 
Tweeks swears they are the right ones. 

Give me a mail if I can fill in more war stories.....they are great once they 
are in!!

PS anyone out there interested buying a complete air injection system including 
pump and manifold in excellent condition??

Also, I have the pre-muffler (replacement for a cat on a 911SC)  original 
Porsche part with 1300 km on it....anyone want to buy it??

I'm about to purchase an Oil Pressure Guage and Oil Temperature Guage
from Surplus Center (1-800-488-3407), VDO, cheap, without senders.
My paranoia forces me to know what's really going on behind my
back (pun intended) <g>.  Questions are:

1) Oil Pressure.  0-30 or 0-100 PSI (I'm assuming 0-30).
2) Oil Temperature.  What should my 'normal' operating range be ?
3) Think I should buy the exhaust temperature guage so I have
   a three guage set instead of two ?? (humor - sort of).
4) Anyone know where I can get senders for these at reasonable $$ ?
5) Any tips on putting these in (73 2.0L w/carb, 72 car).

For those interested (babble time) I've pulled my car out of the garage
(whew).  About to install the 911 Master Cyl. and left rear caliper I got

Ok I confess, I too want to put fiberglass bumpers on my '72T, but
I'm wondering what the general consensus is on who makes good ones, how
much to pay, etc.

(and yes, I will keep the old ones!  Hell,  keep everything - I have 
several sets of old spark plugs, and zillions of nuts for the valve covers!)

I am also interested in getting a set of what I think are called H5's, 
the headlights with the big, slanted glass like on the later 911's

One last thing:  I plan on painting my 911 later this year, maybe late summer.
I want to remove the back windshield when I do.  The question is, how do
you get that puppy back in?  I know how to do the front, but not the back,
unless its exactly like the front, which it doesn't appear to be.  Remember, 
it a targa!

Thanks!

re: dean pilgrimage
i was there in 85 (30 YEAR) as part of the 356 registry west coast holiday.
there may have been media etc. but i didn't see any, although i was only there
for a couple of hours. it seemed that most of the fan base is hot-rod oriented.
LOTS of chopped '49 mercs!! and i mean lots. i understand that they start out
at johnnie von neumanns' place, stop at a malt shop (!), and continue along the
same route that dean took that day making all of the stops along the way. i also
understand that there are more than a few clubs. some big others not. i was 
quite impressed. lots of greasy hair and bleached blondes. the post office was
there with one of their mobile offices, special cancellations, etc. the coolest
thing was a t-shirt with a haunting image of deans' eyes on the front designed
by the japanese (mega) fan that erected the monument a few miles up the road 
from the crash site. giant bronze plaques (like 4' x 6') have been added over 
the years. the 'road marker' you refer to is a stainless steel triangle that
surrounds a tree. the plaques are supported off the ground at the trees' base.
the actual crash site has been obscured by the fact that, due to road improve-
ments, the intersection of highways 41 & 46 now resides about 50 yards away.
anyway, good luck w/ your idea. who knows?

Thanks Jerry, but that's actually:

http://eden.telalink.net/zoomst/copcars/copcars.html

I just looked at Maryland (my state) and found it *seriously* out of date,
i.e., there was no mention of the NEW colors the new cruisers are being painted
(dark olive and Black or Navy Blue, I think), and no mention of the Metallic
Copper/Red late Pontiac 4-door Grand Prix the county mounties are using on the 
beltway (don't ask how I know...)

Virginia looked OK, and North Carolina also looked OK.  South Carolina
was among the missing.  ( I often drive MD -> SC and back )

Once you are at this page, you can go to the National Speed Trap registry

http://www.nashville.net/speedtrap/  which in turn, has a link to RADAR's

Subject: Re: 914 Oil Press/Temp Guages

>1) Oil Pressure.  0-30 or 0-100 PSI (I'm assuming 0-30).

        The two ranges of gauges I was offered by GPR were 0-80 and
0-150.  0-30 is *definitely* too small.  I'm getting the gauge because
I want to keep mine under 60-70 PSI.  (Non-stock oil pressure control
spring.)

>2) Oil Temperature.  What should my 'normal' operating range be ?

        Get a gauge that will read up to 250 F or more.  Normal would
be just over 212 F--gotta get the water out of the oil!  240 is too damn
hot.

>4) Anyone know where I can get senders for these at reasonable $$ ?

        GPR is pretty good.

>5) Any tips on putting these in (73 2.0L w/carb, 72 car).

        Carbs?  Yech!  Oh, well.  To put the oil pressure sender on a
914, you need a new sender (duh).  One that is calibrated to work with
your new gauge.  Dual senders are not much more expensive than the
single ones, and it's still a Very Good Thing to have the idiot light
right in your field of view.  There's an "adaptor kit" which is essen-
tially a hose with fittings on either end.  You screw the hose into the
hole where the idiot light sender is now (up by the distributor) and
then screw the other end into the dual sender.  Then find somewhere to
mount the sender.  You'll need two wires going into the cockpit--the
old idiot light wire is good for one, try locating the defroster wire
for the other one.  Or some other unused (*really* unused!) wire.
        You can get the sender, adaptor, and gauge for about $70 total
from GPR.

        For the temperature sender, you'll need to replace a "sump cover"
on the bottom-left side of the engine.  Porsche made ones fitted for a
temp sender, and they are available aftermarket as well.  Check with GPR,
AutoMashin', and local wreckers.  AFAIK, put the sender in the new plate,
drain your oil, replace the plate, and find a wire to hook the sender to.
In the stock applications, it goes across the bottom of the engine, up
through the sheetmetal on the right-hand side, and connects with a wire
from the main harness.

        Putting the gauges in is your problem.  Several companies make
plates to hold them.  My new oil pressure gauge is going into the center
console, replacing that cheesy clock.

Sorry to drop a non porsche related message, but this is probably of interest
to anyone on this and other mailing lists.

get procmail!

This is a public domain package that filters mail for you.  It can be installed
even if you use a dial up service for mail (usually).  This is what I've done
since my current provider does not have it installed for general use.

It will do a lot for you, but mostly...

you can send any/all mail to /dev/null while on vacation, not bother anyone
on the list with drop/add messages, not bother stan with drop/add messages
to the correct location, and you can turn it on and off as easily as renaming
or editting a file.  It will not use any disk space when messages are sent
to /dev/null.

It also makes a great sorter for breaking out anything (and I mean anything)
you wish to ignore, focus on, etc.

If you want help finding it or setting it up, email me and we'll get it 
working.  This should help stan's administration issues some.

I have to offer up a little defense for our fellow porschephile,  here.  I 
agree that there is usually a good reason for low limits, 25, 35, but 45s 
are generally road defined.  I've never seen anything greater than 25 or 35 
 where there are children or residences.  In suburban areas, 45s here in the 
state of Northern California mean the traffic engineers (these are the 
engineering students who couldn't do anything else) thought that those 
curves might be too much to Grandma in her old buick.

I don't know anything about Hickory, but it may be quite desolate and rural, 
so the possibility exists that our friend was just enjoy his P-car for a 
day,  and not unnecessarily endangering anything more than rabbits or quail.

If it was near where my kids play, however, he should be emasculated.

Subject: 914 Oil Temp Gauge - How much red?

Hopefully simple question:

On a 74 914 2.0L with center console oil temp gauge,  how far into the 
wide red zone is 'too far?'   

I just got this 2.0L this past weekend and the gauge is different than 
on the 1.8L (w/ctr console) that I have been driving and racing 
(autocross and time trials) for the past two years.  

On the 1.8L  there is just a little (less than 1/8 in) red zone all the 
way to the right.  It is real obvious when you get too hot.  Hasn't 
really happened much, unless on long hot summer day trips in TX sun or 
extended track periods at full blast.

The 2.0 has a red zone that starts about midway on dial.  This car 
reaches that red zone much faster.   Any comments???   Yes I know I 
probably want to put in an oil cooler,  I am planning too eventually.

You can also use vacation along with elm's filter program - just filter out
the lists that you don't want, and then remove the rule when you get back!
Its also useful to filter out the 914 and 924 stuff :)

I removed mine (72T) but had a local auto glass shop install it.

As I remember, it was about $80.00 to install on an "spare" time
basis.

It probably took a week for him to get around to it.

He asked that the glass/wiring harness/gasket/trim be delivered first
so he could set this up before the car arrived.

These parts are assembled and then the assembly is installed.

I had to install the Targa bar cover, interior paneling.

BTW, I had the rear glass film-tinted when it was off. 

This cost $150 at a shop in San Jose, CA. 

If you're planning on having it tinted, glass off the car is the only way to
do it.

I know that the road is more or less "rural" now..the number of the highway

I'm not sure what the number was changed to unless I go look at a Dean

Subject: H.G. Bieker and my 2.0 litre heads

 Stan,
 
 (next in my series of stupid questions)
 
 I called Bieker to ask for him to add a few things to my list of "things to do" 
 on the heads:
 
 First I asked if he was going to match the combustion chamber volumes and he 
 said that was a waste of time.  I guess that they are gonna be really close 
 when he is done so that there is no reason to do that?  (I asked that because 
 on my last set of VW heads, they did that but then again they reshaped the 
 chambers as well....)
 
 Then I was gonna see if he could install a set of stiffer springs, in 
 particular, the FAT performance set.  I told him I plan on using the FAT FC 
 HP440 fuel-Injection-friendly cam.  He said that he basically does two types of 
 914 engines... bone stock and race modified.  He warned me about using a 
 non-stock cam with FI and said that the springs would increase the wear on the 
 valves.  He said to check with my guru (that would be Mr. Hanks, formerly of 
 Ghost Racing) about if I wanted to get FAT to send out a set of springs.  He 
 seemed to like the stock ones....
 
 Questions for you (and the p-phile list):  I know that using stiffer springs 
 and the 440HP cam is a trade-off, but is it a good one?  How about using the 
 440HP with stock springs or sticking with all stock stuff?  Any idea as to what 
 sort of HP and performance gain that cam alone would provide on an 8.2-8.5 cr 
 2.0L d-jet engine when compared to stock cam on that same engine?  Am I gonna 
 have any driveability probs with the 440HP and d-jet?
 
 Oh, one more:  For a high-flow oil pump, what do I use? I heard that the 
 Melling pump is good -- I assume that people mean the Type I since I have seen 
 a Type IV.
 
 I realize that these questions were probably answered before, so I apologize.  
 On the other hand I really want to do this thing right!  Thank you again for 
 your time!

Hello all,

Very quick question regarding A/C as Toronto just had a heat wave and I was
able to use it for three days straight.

How often should the A/C Relay  click on/off? In my '87 944 I hear this
relay (I assume it's a relay) click about every 30 seconds or so. I also
feel something that can be described as a "power drain" when the A/C kicks
in (click sounds) then Approx. 30 seconds later I feel some power returning
as the other click is heard. This continually cycles as the cabin fills
with nice cool air.

Question: Is this normal operation? It's the clicking that really bugs me I
guess.

Thanks,

I have used a Hazet 10/11mm offset box-end wrench (the end is in-line with
the handle of the wrench, but about 1" lower) in a way that allows me to
lever against the end of the rod. Not the right tool for the job, but it
worked in a pinch ...

Yep, a cycling like that is about normal...

More likely than not, it will depend on the temperature setting that you 
have set the control to... The higher the setting, the less often will the 
AC clutch cycle...

You forgot to mention one of my favorite techniques for removing

you heat, use plenty of fireblanket, and don't forget the fire
extinguisher (don't ask me how I know this!).

This technique is not for the faint of heart and I *definitely*
recommend less aggressive procedures first.  I have had
excellent results with Kroil penetrating oil applied per your

To memory, on the early C4's there was a problem with a wire on or
around the radio.  I think it was getting the insulation rubbed off, and
draining the battery.

There was a tech bulletin last year describing protocols for solving
drain problems on the 4 and 6 cylinder cars.  It included a change to the
wiring of the 911 clock to reduce drain.  Bulletin is book K, group 2,

P-philers,
     I'm making great progress re-reassembling my '82 911SC Targa.
 (reassembled theft recovery).  I'm trying to reconstruct the history of the
car,  but all of the original VIN numbers (redundant?) are gone.
It has a reassigned six digit Kentucky number which obviously doesn't  tell
me much.  My Haynes manual mentions two places where the VIN will appear: 1)
on the "A" pillar adjacent to the winshield on the drivers side. 2) on the
trunk floor, forward and to the right of the gas tank.  I can see where the
numbers have been removed in both of these places.  My question is, does the
VIN appear anywhere else on the car?

Hi Tracy,

Your car uses a vacuum boost.  It's that black flying saucer behind the
brake master cylinder.  It's a simple yet clever device.  When you step
on the brakes, the linkage movement causes a valve from the intake manifold
to open, "bleeding" vacuum into the booster.  The booster contains basically
a large diaphragm connected to the brake linkage.  With vacuum on one side
and atmospheric pressure on the other, you get up to 14 PSI (times area)
extra boost to the linkage.

As others have suggested, check the vacuum line to the booster, esp. the
one-way valve.  Also check the booster for fluid leaking into it from the
MC.

The HD springs are mainly useful if you plan on having a high-rev application.
That means that you do the *REST* of the stuff for making reliable high
revs, which I don't think you're doing. So stock springs are OK. The valve
wear issue has never come up on a racing engine, they get torn down frequently
enough that it's never not been caught in routine "clean up". 

BTW, "high rev" means planning on sustained operation over 6000 RPM. Bursts
into that area is OK.

You *WILL* have a noticeably different idle with the 440HP. You will. Period.
It's OK for a street car that doesn't have A/C. It's intractible if you have
and insist on using A/C. 

You will see almost no HP gain in a good stock rebuild with *slightly*
higher compression. Maybe half an HP or so. Really. If you go to the
"hotter" cam, and 9:1 or better compression (max is 9.5:1 for street gas,
with oil cooler) then you'll get a fairly significant increase, on the
order of 15%. The springs issue has to do with how high you run the
engine. If you stay under 6000 RPM, you're fine with NEW stock springs.
If you're shooting for the 8000 RPM limit that you *CAN* have on more or
less stock heads, well, you've got another 3 kilobucks of parts and
labor to go -- Carrillos, lightended wrist pins, etc etc etc. *THEN*
you *NEED* the stiffer springs.

I had the same thought, then realized that it'd take a pretty special

G'Day P'philers,

While in the states a couple of years ago (staying with my wife's parents in FL)
I happened across this BEAUTIFUL example of a 911(??) sitting outside
"Crawdaddys" in Jacksonville FL.

Apart from being a VERY interesting restaurant (both inside AND out) the
Porsche took my breath away (yes...slight exaggeration but you get my drift)

Had to take a picture...picture now scanned...picture NOW is to be found in...

So the question is....Does anyone on this list belong to it? If so...ENJOY!!
If not...ENJOY anyway :^) it's called "p-car.gif" (original..I know! :)

There is one more image to be found there..spotted THIS one on the back of a
Car sellers magazine.. It is for 356 enthusiasts :^) (pretty...green)
You'll find it in the same location (as above) called.. "356c.gif"

A BIG thank you to "BP" the owners of the advertisement.

One day I'll be able to brag about MY own P-Car (sniff..blub..splutter :)

if the limit was introduced as a tax gathering device on a "good

it is stupid to risk the heavy fine

if the limit is there for some safety reason, then the driver is acting

Subject: Re: New paint job; what do I need to know?

Getting a car painted is a real challenge, mainly as I have found in my area 
that there is little correlation between a firm's reputation and their actual 
work. I have done all my own paint work during the rebuilding of my 911 and I'd 
do the following.

1. Try and enlist the help of other Porsche owners, car buffs or other folk who 
may have knowlege of the paint shops in your area and see if they are aware of 
any shops which can do a good job. Obviously if they are willing to go with you 
to inspect/discuss then so much the better

2. Read up on paint technology and techniques so that you at least understand 
the lingo

3. Make up your mind on things like budget, how far you want them to go (ie 
strip it down to the metal versus just apply a top coat to the visible 
surfaces). This is quite important as you need to decide whether you want them 
to strip out the windows, trim, rubber etc or whether you want them just to mask 
around all that stuff. You also should decide if you want to do some of the 
work, for example are you willing and capable of stripping the trim off of the 
car, are you willing to start with the rough sanding or repairs etc.

4. Decide on colour, if it is a colour change, remember that they then need to 
paint door jambs and the like to match

5. Go visit some shops, insist on walking around the shop and inspect the work 
and paint areas. If it looks professiona, if it appears to be kept clean in the 
paint area and if it appears that they are not just slapping on coats of bondo 
and paint then at least you have a starter. Ask to meet some previous owners, 
preferably P cars or other classic/high end cars so that you can find out 
directly from a previous client how good the work is. Try and get one at least a 
year old, in case some adhesion or similar problem came up....many lousy paint 
jobs look good for the first 6 months.

6. Have a long chat on point 3 and 4, get a firm quote, ask about whether it is 
a fixed price and, when you have 2 or 3 such quotes.....decide and go.


I won't take up the bandwidth for what to do during the whole exercise, if you 
are interested we can continue off line....

Subject: Re: New paint job; what do I need to know?

SOme qualifying paint shop questions:

	1. References. Good painters are *DAMN PROUD* of thier work
	2. INspect the facilities. Quality paint shops will have some
	   *VERY* expensive equipment in their paint booths. Downdraft
	   exhasut system is a good sign. Look at the filters near the
	   air intake areas of the paint booth. Good shops change/clean
	   these VERY frequently. It will be obvious if they do this.

	3. Ask about materials. My experience is that the really good
	   Porsche/BMW/Mercedes shops use the same paint that the factory
	   sprays. It is *DIFFICULT* to work with (I know from personal
	   experience). Few paint shops do this. The difference: Exact
	   color match, comparable finish and durability to factory finish.
	   FYI, the facotry uses polyurethane enamel paint.

	4. How do they prepare the car (preparation is everything if a quality
	   finish is desired). Is the car disassembled (mirrors removed,
	   bumpers removed, all trim removed, glass removed, etc) or is
	   it "masked off" (bad sign). Look around at other cars in process.

	5. Do they strip the car first? (only really bad prior paint will
	   require this, your facotry finish has special protective primers
	   that cannot be duplicated- remember Porsche brochures showing
	   the cars being dipped in primer with electric charges applied
	   to create better bond?)

	6. Inspect finished cars under flourescent lighting. THis exposes
	   all the imperfections in paint. Pay attention to minute details
	   (orange peel, overspray, sand scratches, dirt in paint, runs,
	   uniform gloss, uniform distribution of metallic)

A quality paint job will not be cheap. It is worth paying a premium if you
really want it to look new and last many years. TAke your time selecting and
getting to know your potential paint shop.

Good luck

The "dream come true" post and replies prompted me to post a similar story.
Last summer I was driving from Princeton, NJ up to Macworld Expo in Boston.
On I-84 (87?) in Conn (flame retardant: it's a 4-lane, fairly low-traffic
interstate) I finally gave in to the temptation to see just what my 951
could do. Well, speed is thrilling, but if you want a *real* adrenaline
rush just try blowing past a state trooper at 145+ mph ;>).
My co-pilot suggested ducking into the next rest stop "in case he got on

in right next to us. I was getting ready to kiss my license goodbye when he
said "Jesus Christ almighty that's a fast little car. I thought they just
looked good. Now that you've had your fun, lighten up. Have a safe trip."
BTW, the 300+ mile drive took 3 hours, including 1 rest stop. My co-pilot
is now trying to sell his Vette to buy a Porsche. Flame if it makes you
feel better, but I didn't buy a Porcshe just to impress the neighbors.

Hi Everyone,

Well, last night was a bad one for me.  As I was pulling into the hotel parking
lot, a woman backed sqaure into the passenger side of my P-car.  The sound of
the metal crunch cut clear through my heart.

She was driving a stock 4wd toyota pick-up truck with a cab/camper/cover? on
the back.  (You know the things that go on the back of the truck to effectively
make it a king size station wagon.)  So, in a way, I can't blame her too much.
 I'm sure she could not see me.  But of course, the only damage to her was some
red paint on her chrome bumper.  15 minutes with some paint remover, and she'll
be good as new.

On the other hand, I now have an otherwise perfect Targa with some serious
damage to the passenger door and right rear quarter panel.  So, HELP please.
 Does anyone know of a few absolute top notch body shops in the Mountain View,
Sunnyvale ... Bay Area of California?  I'll be getting insurance quotes next
week.  I want my baby repaired as soon as possible (without sacrificing any
quality).

Thanks lots.

Okay, so here is my skeleton on the subject:

At the time , I was active duty military and had a 1986 944. So, it is 
0300 on a 4-lane urban freeway, the moon is bright, the road clear, my 
halogens on burn-through, and I enter the I5 to I8 interchange at 5500 in 
4th, bend left into the perfectly banked, 3-lane, uphill curve, 
flattening out in 5th and continue hard onto the straight. I can see 
forever to the west..........

This road runs 3+ miles straight until it ends at a T controlled by a light.
About 1/2 mile into this run I detect a 'tailgater' on my butt. Large 
chills hit my spine as I realize that this car is so close to my rear 
that if I lifted (let alone braked), there would be a collision. Jinking 
left or right didn't shake him and by now I was down to less than 90mph; 
he was now so close I could not see his headlights! I also know that in 
less than 45 seconds, a decision point (the T intersection) would occur 
and all the PCA racing school lessons were instinctively coming to play.

One half-mile before the intersection, the lights on the police car came 
on and he backed off enough to let me hit the brakes and clear the left 
turn into the intersection. Very calmly he wrote me the ticket for 80+ in 
a 55 zone (his speedo was only certified up to 80). 

I never ran like that again. Two reasons (1) the police car that 
tailgated me could very well have been a drunk and  may have rammed me or 
forced me off the road (2) $273 fine plus $180 increase on my insurance.

Mike,
	I have just gone through a similar experience with my 1987 944S.
we replaced the oil cooler seals twice with no success. After pressure testing 
the cooling system with the cam cover off it appeared that there was coolant
leaking from the upper front head stud. After removing the head, cleaning it, 
and preparing for new valve guides, we saw a crack in the head between the two 
front head bolt holes on the top of the head (cam side). I thought I had a 
rare 
problem, but maybe I didn't. I suspect you have a similar problem. My oil was
not milky so we did not replace the rod bearings ( no problems yet). We 
replaced
the head with a rebuilt one from Porsche (use the new part number with - CRX 
suffix). It came with new valves and springs and appeared to be as close to 
new as you could get. Good luck. - Bill Maroun (bktech@ot.com)

I am still having trouble with my 944.  I need to now how to check the

it was a bad DME at first but I got another one and it still won't start.
I have no spark at the coil.  The local shop said they could check the
sensors that feed info to the DME, but at $55 an hour I want to try first
since he said he couldn't give me any estimate on how long it would take.
Also, does any one know of a good shop south of Washington DC, I live 5

This is a common point for metal fatigue failure..  I wound up

AEK's method of grabbing the bar with a box-end wrench works.

 deer season while school busses are dropping off kids from school!  My

30 MPH on most of the wonderful road that leads to the track.  On one of the

     I may hold a worlds record for a 911; fitting 8 people in a '73 Targa
 for a 5-10 mile trip from a football game. We were smaller then (I was 16
 and most were 14 and 15, I think). Me driving, a girl in the passenger
 seat with a lapmate; 2 in the rear seats with a lapmate each and one person
 crammed on the whole mess. It wasn't a contest, we just had to get home.

     The shame with a 928 is that the only person who could really fit   
 in the back was an old 4'11" girlfriend. 

     That Nissan commercial does make a great pitch for that beautiful
  911 cab....

The only problem I have with this is that I have gleaned a lot of good

even the 924/44/28 owners.  While I agree that a model-specific mailing

Hi Bill,

Sorry this happened to you.  There was a tech bulletin describing this
problem with the 944S and 928S4 heads.  With the 944S, there was *no*
part number change on the new casting.  They bumped the part number for
the 928S4.  The "CRX" tag simply means that it's a Porsche reman'ed part,
no guarantees as to casting number.  I am not sure how one is supposed
to tell the new from old version -- perhaps the casting number is indeed
different.

There have been a bunch of repeat problems with oil/water heat exchanger
sealings, also for the sealings of the 944 Turbo's manifold (same location
as aspiro but no heat exchanger).  You have to measure and use the right
number of shims on the rear boss (or whatever it's called); covered in at
least one tech bulletin (qua PCNA nastygram to their dealership mechanics!).

Bill, yours is the first case of a cracked head I've run into myself, so I
am curious.  When you pulled the cam cover off, did you see coolant in the
head?  How noticable was the crack?

Well, Joe, 

The proper way to diagnose this problem is to follow the diagnostic 
procedure given in Section 28 of the Factory Service Manual.

The short version for ignition problems:

1) make sure that the sensors are putting out the proper signal at the 
proper levels.

2) Check the cap, rotor, wires and coil for proper condition.

3) Replace the DME if necessary.

Sounds like you've done #3, now it's time to do #1 and #2...

Good Luck!

Subject: Re: Speeding

Like most laws made to protect people from themselves, speed
limits are made to fit the lowest common denominator (you know,
that guy in the Yugo with the bouncing rear tire, who's always
looking lost).  It is possible to drive faster, and still be
safe.  I'm not sure why anyone would spend the kind of money
we spend on such incredibly fast cars, if they never intended
to use them beyond the capabilities of a Yugo.  Furthermore,
driving under the speed limit does not automatically make you
safe, and driving over the speed limit does not automatically
make you unsafe.

Yes, I speed.  Here is my strategy for safe, ticket free (I
have had NO tickets at all for the past 6 years of living in
Orange County, CA) speeding:

(1) If you can't do it safely, don't.
(2) Avoid displays of excess ("exhibition of speed").
(3) Limit your speeding to rapid accelerations with minimal tire
    squealing (another "exhibition of speed").
(4) Limit your speeding, for the most part, to no more than 15%
    over the posted limit (I was told by a police officer that
    they ignore up to 10 or 15% excess speed because equipment
    errors can mount up to that--such as their radar guns and
    speedometers).
(5) Keep with the flow of traffic (don't be conspicuous).

Like many of you (and you know who you are--don't try to deny it),
I have pushed the limits, just to see what the limits are.  I had
my 928 up to 148mph on the 15 freeway, in the middle of a weekday,
with no traffic in sight.  I would have gone faster, but I caught
up to another car, and chickened out.  I did it only once, and
have never encountered conditions safe enough to do it again (like
no other cars in sight).  Since I am a new member of PCA, I look
forward to pushing the limit on the track at events.

Hi Steve,

You've already gotten some good responses from Dennis and Jim, so I'll just 
add that attending a local PCA concours is a great way to find out about 
local painters.  Owners are generally eager to talk about their cars, and 
you'll get a first hand look at the results.

I'm doing my '73 Targa presently, and will use Glaurit paint in the original 
color. I was going to use PPG Deltron because I've painted with it before, 
but the original Gemini Blue isn't available.  The Glasurit will end up 
costing me and extra $150, but everyone tells me it's the best and a dream

Hi Kevin,

	The coolant loss in my engine was slight and only showed up at the oil

cooling 
system was being pressure tested. Originally we thought that the coolant was 
running up the stud and that the head gasket was leaking. Only after the head 
was cleaned in a cold process cleaner could the crack be seen. The crack was 
hard to see and was not noticed for several hours (the head dried and the 
crack appeared as a damp line between head bolt holes).

cutting my own hoses, and finding all of the rest of the stuff to make the
'12 look stock from an interior point of view.  I have a 911 with air on it,
so I have something to base my placement of equipment.  Will it run too hot?
 Will there be no power?  I just need air to run around in, not perform, that
is during the weekends, autocrossing......

This is an easy one!

First, disconnect the battery by undoing the ground strap in the rear of the
hatch, just underneath the tool kit.

Second, pull the horn cover off the steering wheel.  Brute force will do
nicely.

Third, get a 1/2 inch socket set and the appropriate socket to take off the
nut holding the wheel on.

Fourth, BEFORE removing the wheel, mark the wheel and the shaft so you can put
it back on in the same position.  Use a center punch and a hammer to make some
dots.

Question:  you're going to "re-align" the steering wheel?
Say what?

If you mean that the steering wheel is off center when you're going down the
road, first have a front end alignment done and specify that you want them to
check the center point steering.  That is to say, when the wheels are pointed
straight, the steering gear should be in the exact middle of its travel range.
 

If this is OK and the steering wheel still is off-center, then yes, you can
take it off and put it back on so it is "straight".

BTW, I need to have my steering wheel restitched.  I would like some feedback
from you regarding where you are getting this done, how much it costs, how
long it takes, etc.

Thanks and good luck!

Having just replaced mine, I can understand why you would want a used one.

In a fit up carelessness I touched a curb with mine and left a really nasty
series of scrapes along the bottom corner and ripped the underbelly cover
off of the bumper cover, tearing the bolt holes.

The bumper cover is a ~$1,300 part, and when all was said and done, it took
~$2500 to fix it all up.

There is definetly a part about these cars that sucks.

 From an article I read in Excelence, there is a recomendation on oil for
older 911's. Seems Porsche doesn't recomend Synth oil in older motors due
to some reaction with the seals and gaskets. My question is this, on a new

This was the answer.  I actually was out looking at the relay board when I
was the DME relay.  If I had only asked the right question three months ago
before I almost went crazy trying to solve this.
I jumpered the input to the output pins and wellah my baby started up
again.  The only problem is my A/C doesn't work now probably because I
pulled something out while I had the fuse/relay panels down.
Anyway thanks for all the help.  I knew I wouldn't have to go to a shop

Dear 993 owners,

I'm thinking of getting a 993 and in need of some advice:

How long did it take for your order to arrive?

How trouble free is your car? Do you have to go back to the dealer once a
while to fix some problems? I lost some faith in the durability of germent
cars after owning a 1993 BMW. But still can't resist the temptation to own
a porsche. I don't expect a 993 to be perfectly trouble free but can you
tell me what kind of problems you have encountered so far no matter how
minor they are.

What is the maintenance schedule like?
Do you maintain it yourself? It may sound crazy but again I can't resist
to work on a porsche. I want to do at least the oil change myself.

Any other good advice?

Oh boy... 

Let me preface this appropriately: I'm a native Texican, grew up in the 
sands of far west Texas, have been in Houston for the last well, nearly
20 years. I have owned over 25 Porsches. Two had A/C. I'm currently driving
a '64 356SC, about 1500 miles a month. No A/C. 

I'm also a, ummm, how to put this most modestly, *HIGHLY* experienced
architect and implementer of air cooled engines requiring extremes of 
power. And have spent a ton of time just generally fooling around with
both the P-cars and their close bretheren, the air-cooled VWs (and Isettas,
just to get them all in...)

You *MOST EMPHATICLY* **DO NOT** want to add A/C to this particular car.

1) it's hard. You can casually add A/C to almost any 911 because for almost
   any model year, most of the 911s had A/C and both the dealer conversion
   kits and the factory parts (for the later years) are readily available.
   912 did not offer A/C as an option. You'll have to use 911 parts which 
   is fine and good until you get to the engine compartment when you find
   that you don't have anything *LIKE* the brackets you need, and that there's
   already something in the way at all of the logical places to put the
   unit. Plus

2) the engine is NOT designed to pull a compressor. It's not even designed
   to *SURVIVE* pulling a compressor. You have three main bearings. You're
   pulling on the end of the crank with a high torque moment. Go back to
   Physics 101 (maybe that's Physics 430, you did say College Station.. 8{) )
   and think about what that means. No, don't bother -- I'll *TELL* you:
   it means you're gonna bend the crank.

   Now go price 912 cranks. That should leave you pretty cold. But not
   for long because

3) the resulting loss in air flow through the engine deck lid is also 
   catastrophic and will result in engine overheating. The 911 moves a TON
   of air with that big fan, and it's also a dry-sump engine with the oil
   lines serving to radiate a lot of the heat away from the engine OUTSIDE
   of the engine compartment.  The 912 uses an oil cooler sized for operation
   in Der Fatherland, *NOT* South Texas. Any impediment is not good.

4) Finally, it's just Bad Car-ma. There are damn few decent 912s out there.
   There are a TON of clapped out late 70s Toyotas with GREAT A/C that
   you can buy for under $1200. You'd spend nearly that putting the A/C in
   the 912, so why not buy a car that HAS the A/C if you gotta have it,
   and leave the 912 alone for the next owner???

True, but put a Chalon 2 slantnose body on a 914, push the wheels out 
to the fender lips, add 911 boxed rockers, and lower the thing a few 
inches, and you get a car with exceptional aerodynamic performance.

I've got a model of my 914 (modified as described above) running in 
Algor's fluid-dynamics simulator, and it performs pretty well.  Cd is 
nothing like that of a modern passenger car (although it's 
significantly better than that of a stock-bodied 914), but it's 
respectable for such a wide-bodied car.  The center of pressure is in a 
good spot, and the body doesn't generate lift until the angle of attack 
gets really high (e.g., rear springs at full compression and front 
wheels completely off the ground).

There's still a problem with the relatively-upright windshield, but 
even that can be fixed by changing the angle of the windshield (if 
you're willing to source new vent and side glass and cut down the targa 
top so it fits into, instead of on top of, the roll bar).

The biggest problem is the low-pressure area behind the rear window.  
Bob Norwood solved this on his Can-Am Chevy-powered Ferrari GTO (in his 
case, the problem was so bad at 200 MPH that the engine was being 
starved for air) by building a giant scoop that covered the engine lid 
and extended up over the roof of the car, but that solution has obvious 
negative implications for rearward vision.  I have no idea what to do 
about this.
 
I'm thinking of cutting louvers in the front fenders to release the 
high pressure that forms there (a la the factory 911 slantnose 
fenders)... Gotta modify the model and run more simulations, I guess.

Does anyone know whether Alex Cross's shop (Swift Engineering, in San 
Clemente, CA) rents out their new wind tunnel?

Add to Stan's list:
5) Why not stick with the A/C you've got? It has a wonderful 280 air 
conditioning unit... YOu simply open the 2 windows, travel at approx. 80 
mph, and you'll be cool in no time. :)

On a serious note though, have you thought of getting a window shade for 
your car? No car with black vinyl interior should be left sitting in sun 
without one. For the 911 drivers, they shall learn the hard way that 
their dash will break down from being treated in this manner. Also, due 
to the unique window curvature of these cars, I recommend rear window 
shields too (just use some tape) and leave your windows cracked a little. 
For those of you worried that this increases the likelyhood of your car 
being stolen, think again, for the average car thief will use a slim jim 
unless he/she can get their arm in good and clear.

Subject: My First Year of Porschedom

Pfellow Pfilers:

        I am rapidly approaching the end of my first year of Porsche
ownership.  I decided to
write down some of my impressions and share them with all of you.  This
will probably
be rather long, so delete it now if'n you ain't interested.

        I purchased an '84 911 Carrera Targa in early July of last year.  I
had wanted a coupe, but
I'm 6'4" tall, with a long torso, and there wasn't any way a sunroof coupe
would fit me.  Since
911s imported to the US came with a sunroof as part of the package, I would
have to find a 911
where the owner special ordered it without a sunroof, or buy a Euro-spec
car.  Since I was
wary of new smog laws, I wanted a US-spec car.  I still think a coupe looks
better, but the
Targa is a reasonable compromise.  I rejected cabs for safety reasons.

        So I have a targa.  My wife and kids love it.  I have gotten real
used to the wind in my
hair, and my colleagues at work have grown used to me walking around with
mussed hair.
I originally sort of wanted ice green paint, but wasn't that firm on it.
Ice green is gorgeous,
but the platinum color on my car keeps growing on me.

        For the most part, my 911 has been pretty reliable.  I had to
replace the ignition key,
since mine wore to the point that my key wouldn't start it.  This was
rather expensive for
the parts, but it wasn't hard to repair.  It needs a new clutch, and while
I'm in there (gulp)
I'm going to have the gearbox rebuilt, install new rear shocks, fix the
lowering job that
the PO did, adjust the valves, etc.

LIKES:

        Looks.  It's gorgeous.  It's still one of the high points of my day
to walk up to my
car.

        Huge brakes.  Monster brakes.  Brakes without end.  No muss, no
fuss, just an easily
controlled stop.  My biggest surprise, and brakes on every other vehicle
I've ever driven
*suck* in comparison.

        Power.  Tractible, easily controlled, always there.  At 100 mph at
6000 feet altitude in
4th gear, flooring the throttle provides acceleration that can be felt.
It's bone stock, too.

        Reliability.  I don't drive it hard, but then I'm not easy on it
either.  No failures, and
at 95,000 miles, the compression and leakdown are well within spec values.

        Satisfaction.  I'm sure most people have had the situation where
something long wanted
has finally been obtained, and the reality doesn't much up with the desire.
My 911 is
*better* then I'd every imagined.  I hope never to be Porscheless again.

        Porschephiles.  This list is unique in both content and general
manners.  My hat is off
to Stan and all participatory Nazi Sheep.

DISLIKES

        The hood shocks are lame.  They wear out easily and often, and
aren't cheap to replace.
I gave up in disgust and bought a cool, collapsible prop from Griot's
Garage.  Works great,
the pox on shocks.

        The cheap plastic internal door handles suck.  My driver's side
handle just broke.  Everybody
I know has handles that have broken or are breaking.  I know the car is 10
years old, but jeez...

        The door pockets split and squeak and rattle over bumps.  What do
you do with the$e
other than replace them?

        And there you have it.  One very satisfied new owner.  The only
thing I wish was different
is that my wife won't let put her half of the 911 on the track for driver's
ed events.  Oh, well...

I guess the "Speeding 100+ on a 45mph country road" guy has had his 
fifteen minutes of fame.  At least he's seemed to captivate a number of 
us the way the double-murder trial has so many of my fellow Sacramento, 
California neighbors.

On task...

The issue is not speeding.  It's reality.  He wrote back to a mild 
"flame" of mine by asking (paraphrased) "How could it be showing off 
when no one was around?  "Well, basically by telling us.  You're showing 
off after the fact.  Some call it bragging boasting or blowing hot air.  
You give the impression that you are somehow proud of your act, having done
it and having been validated by being let go by the officer.

I too have broken a few similar speed laws in equally flagrant ways, but
I'm a bit embarrassed.  Not, because I'm some kind of "Casper Milktoast,"
but because I was being a "hotdog" (alone) pushing the envelope in places it 
shouldn't have been done.  I almost killed a little country boy on a 
little (45mph) country road when he and a friend were running accross the 
road.  That wasn't cool and I don't want to see someone else take my near 
fatal mishap to the next step.  

Country roads are much less deserted than one thinks.  While you may only 
see one house every mile or so, you can suddenly run into a crowded 
environment.  I know, I live in such an area and have seen it happen many 
times.

Now, on a secluded section of the Interstate, go for it if you feel 
confident of your solitude.  The open highway is much much much much much 
safer and more practical (and more fun) than a rolling country road.  
Besides, you are much less likely to put yourself in the pokey when a 
state trooper or highway patrol spot you.

Basically, the speed isn't the problem & we're not just jelous because 
that cop didn't let us off--it is just a matter of knowing when and how 
to explore the uncharted horsepower found only at the floorboard.  

I don't want to see this mailing list go limp, but there can be a 
performance skewed medium that we can all find palatable.

Hiall,

Have to get my 0.02 in before this 'speeding; story gets banned.

Unfortunately(?) it is only the odd few of us that never did break the speeding limits. Most of us surely pushed our cars to the limit sometime back in our younger days.

When you get older, perhaps get a kid or so, you start to think about 'what if this/what if that happens...'. It is part of maturing.

Being a sinner (former sinner that is) on 2 or 4 wheels I understand the need and urge for younger chaps (I'm 31) to show off either by having friends in the car, or brawling wild afterwards. But I can sure tell you that noone remembers what you have 'accomplished' in this 'sport' when the years go by,...actually you hardly remember it yourself.

If I lived in the USA, where cars are looked upon as an important part of life, and not taxed to death, I would rig a race car and take it to the track as often as possible, stretching the combination of car driver as far as possible,...and have GREAT fun. This you will remember,....and look back upon with joy.

And if you're real good you don't have to brawl either, it will be official, they might even decide to give you some 'buckets' too.....!


My advice is,...if you want to play with your own *and others* lives, ...............join the UN peace corps and *protect* civilians....contrary to threathening them!

Subject: 964 wheels for 911SC

I would like to know if it is possible to fit 964 wheels 6x16" and 8x16" 
to a 911SC. From what I know, the 964 wheels have an offset of 52mm front 
and rear. This translates to a backspace of 129.1mm and 153.6mm 
respectively. The 911SC wheels have a backspace of 125mm front and rear.

Does this mean that I can fit a 4mm spacer to the front and a 28mm spacer 
to the rear? From my calculations, these spacers do not change the track 
of the vehicle.

Well... This certainly has been a full week in terms of WWW stuff... I

results with the whoswho search form, with many requests for me to 
develop a new search program... yeah, well, maybe not today. :) It did 
however, turn out good for the most part, although it is not well 
designed enough to put out to public yet.

I have been getting enormous amounts of mail, but I do reply personally 
to all of them, so that takes a little while. Since the logs do not get 
cleared out daily, and I have not seriously looked at creating a status 
page, I have no clue whether or not hordes of people are storming the

straight from the page, I must assume it is doing okay. Check out

out as something to give people a few other places to visit, but has 
since its introduction (a mere week ago) grown to 22 links. All Porsche 
or car related (most Porsche/exotic car).

I've also FINALLY gotten the new TechTips logo installed, Thanks go out 
to Leonard Zech who I will properly credit on the page tomorrow. I 
haven't seen the page myself yet, due to the fact that I'm trying out 
Netscape 1.2b1, and it crashes every... 2 seconds if it's having a good 
day. :) I think I'm going to go back to 1.1N

To all those sending replies to this message and other web related stuff, 
please excuse the time I'm taking to get back. My poor computer is 
stressed just to get on the internet, and then I go and pile on graphics, 
FTP, Telnet everywhere, and more, and sometimes... well, it just can't 
take it... so, I'm trying to stay within a 2 day reply time, but then, I 
am on the Porschephiles and Air-Cooled and VintagVW lists, so by the time 
I get done reading and replying to 125 pieces of mail, I usually get 25

There is an article by Chuck Stoddard on this in one of the old UpFixin' der
Porsche's published by PCA.  With the orginal  914 gearbox, you use a '71 911
throwout arm and pivot (you have to drill and tap your transaxle case for it;
the boss is cast in), use the '71 throwout bearing sleeve (part that holds
the input shaft seal), use a '72 911 clutch cable, with a '71 white plastic
cable end.  He claims everything bolts up.  But with a 3.2, the 914 gearbox
ought to last about 3 nanoseconds before something breaks unless you spend
big $$ to beef it up.  Probably ought to use a 915 gearbox. Several people
have kits to do that in Panorama.

Just went thru this on an '87 Turbo.  Most likely cause is one of the two
sensors on the top of the bell housing at the rear of the engine that setect
engine speed and TDC off of the flywheel.  The sensors themselves are
identical, and can go bad without warning, or a small pebble or something can
get in the housing a hit one of them. Lack of spark is a sure sign.  Remove
them one at a time and substitute known good ones. Be VERY carefull removing
them; one of ours came apart and we spent the goo dpart of a day getting the
pieces parts out.  The are a snug fit in thier holding bracket.  And no, you
can't remove the bracket with the sensors in ti because of a damn roll pin
that won't let the bracket come out without both sensors being removed.

Or you MIGHT luck out and it is the DME relay on the relay board. Obviously,
I did NOT luck out!

I now carry a spare with me to the track...

Subject: Your assistance please

Hello P-Philers!

I am as yet Porsche-less :-( But am looking for the right car now. I have loved
the 911 since before I new its name. When I was 10 or 11 I used to call it "the
car with all the curves" Well now I am 24, and I need one! I recently drove a
1978sc with 112K on it. I have read in so many different publications, that if
the motor has been maintained, milage, for all intensive purposes is not a
problem. This car was extreemly strong, but I did not realize this until I drove
an '83sc with 80K on it, and it felt slow compared. The same dealer, (NOT a
Porsche dealer) was selling both cars, and was asking $11,000 for the '78, and
$17,000 for the '83.

Then I found out that the '78 was not imported to the US by Porsche. But he did
not want to tell me that, nor did he know where it came from! The VIN is
9119300929. Could someone please tell me where the car is from, and is it
something that should be avoided all together? The car has been completely
re-painted, and it was not a great job. There is bondo on the leading edge of
both fenders, around the headlights. An independant body shop assures me the car
has not been hit, most likely someone just did a poor job of rust repair. The
body shop estimates that to make the car "right" would run about $4000. Should I
just keep lookin'. Your advice, and insight is much appreciated.

Well, you did't really say what your budget is....is it 11K or 17K?
Or more? Figure THAT out first, then start looking.  I looked for 4
months before I found the right 911. It was REALLY tough.....but I
knew I was spending hard earned cash, and did not want to make
a mistake.  It IS very easy to overlook flaws when you've got
money burning a hole in your pocket.
 
As for the car you are looking at, it's a 1979 all right, but
the 5th digit, a 3, indicates it was made for the Japanese
market! I'd say sayonara to that one....

Because this is your first 911, I'd follow Bruce Anderson's
advice and get the newest one you can afford, with the lowest
miles and fewest problems. The fact that you're looking at late
70's/early 80's is a good sign.  You don't need to settle for
lousy body work. To me, that would be an indication of the shape
of the engine too.

Mine did. He had my SC for 3-6 months. $10,000+ of repairs and paint. Car was

I run (ran, actually -- haven't had time to autox in a while) with a full
tank. I also ran with the spare tire, and a ton crap in the front trunk.
Here's why:

1) extra weight over front wheels helped reduce understeer 

2) that's the way I drive it on the street, and how it handles on the
   street is what I'm used to

3) it *REALLY* pisses the "I'm a totally serious autocross guy, don't
   breath on my car it might screw up the alignment" crowd off when I
   beat them (and beat them and beat them....) and then don't even have 
   to re-pack the car to go home...

If, as you say, the car handles better than you drive, what the hell are
you worried about micro-optimizations like THIS for?? Lighten up, get some
seat time with a minimum of fuss and when you get to the point that
you start winning, please note that you didn't have to do anything special
but show up and drive!

Subject: Wandering C2 (long winded story)

	After years of driving a 944 and then a 928, I just got a hold of my
first 911. It's a beautifull 1990 C2, and I couldn't wait to get it on a good
northern Arizona mountain highway to see how it compared with the other two
Porsches I had driven for so many years. It didn't take long to realize that the
911 was (for me) the best of the bunch. The road holding abilities of this car
just blew me away. The high speed stability  was absolutely wonderful. By the
time I got home, the only thing I felt the car needed was a new set of tires on
the rear. 
	The previous owner had the following setup of wheels/tires:
		OZ 17" wheels
		Dunlop D40 M2 215/45ZR17 tires up front
		Dunlop D40 M2 235/45ZR17 tires on the rear
	When replacing the rear tires, I kept the same size but upgraded to the
Dunlop SP8000 model because of its better quality. As I drove away from the tire
shop, I quickly noticed that at 40-50 mph the car started to wander left and
right as if a strong cross wind was tossing me around. The nearby Porsche dealer
later told me that you can't mix tire models or this very thing would happen.
Back to the tire shop I go, this time to replace the front tires with the same
Dunlop SP8000 (215/45ZR17).  As I drive away from the tire shop for the second
time and hit 40 mph, all seems to be back to normal. Unfortuanately, as I
approach 70-80 mph the car starts wandering from side to side again.
	Frustrated (and quickly running out of money) I go to the Porsche dealer
and have them do a front-end alignment. Results: no difference !!!!!
	Has anyone out there in Porschephile land ever run into this kind of
gremlin ?

I keep quater tank and car was set up that amount of gas. Why carry 
extra weight. For every pound of weight you need more power etc.

The 7 and 8 wheels might put you in a non stock class.
Always read the rules if you plan on making any changes to your car. 
That way you will not inadvertainly change something and have to move 
classes.

Subject: 912E surge problems

I just purchased a '76 912E for my wife's birthday and am haveing some
rather seriously annoying problems that my mechanic can't seem to solve.
When first driving cold it runs fine but after some time it begins to buck
and surge as if the fuel is being interupted. This problem comes and goes
but can become severe enough to give a person whiplash.
I just put 2500.00 in paint,1000.00 in an alpine and about 700.00 in engine
tuning and now this....needless to say this present is morphing from an
amazing kodak moment to a maybe we should sell it moment.
Any help would be appreciated.
ps. I put a new starter in because the old one had a dead spot and needed to
be push started every now and then, but I am finding that this one is
beginning to exibit the same symptoms.

I do know something about connectors.  I dropped Andy an idea or two,
but once *all* the requirements are known, the choice stays RJ-11.

Major requirements:

	Consumer application (Can find at radio shack)

	4 wires (rules out traditional power jacks)

	Easy application (rules out "molex" style)

	Affordable (NASA has better connectors, but.....)

Besides, the gold-plated RJ's are *surprisingly* durable.

Yup. I've just changed my rear tyres to a new set of 315/35 and afterwards
the rear end was all over the road. I'm using Yoko AVS's _both_ from and 
rear, but the front tyres were OK so they weren't changed.

My dealer said it was because the tyres haven't "settled" (in lack of a 
better word) yet - and I believe him, because after half a day of track 
driving it went away. I just needed to wear the tyres a bit.

Subject: Altenators

Hey all again,
This is just a note of a reputable alternator source in the SF Bay area.
About a year ago my altenator went out on my 65 911. After calling all the
usual places for parts the chapest I could find a rebuilt unit was in the
250 to 300 range. I looked in the yellow pages and found a place called ASE
(Altenator Starter Exchange) in San Franciso. They mainly sell to
dealerships and shops but quoted me 135 for a rebuilt Bosch. I went down
and exchanged the alternator and promptly came home and installed it.
Unfortunately I hooked it up wrong and immediatly burnt it up. Dejected I
took it back ready to shell out another 135 but instead they gave me a
replacement, free! Just last week the altenator light came on in my 73.5 T
and stayed on with the key out. I knew the altenator had been replaced in
March by the PO but the receipt was from a BMW dealer where he worked. The
dealer would not replace it due to the fact it was a Porsche part and not
BMW. Once again I removed my alt and went to ASE where they checked both
the alt and regulator. I returned in 30 minutes ready to shell out another
135 for my 14 volt Marchal when they told me it was one of their rebuilds
and fixed it on the spot for free!  The alternator had been bought from
them via the BMW dealer. I found the honesty remarlable refreshing. They
had the opportunity to screw my twice but instead fixed the part. The shop
is ASE in San Francisco and anyone needing the number can e-mail me.

The usual disclaimers....just a HAPPY customer :-)

I happened to be glancing at our bulletins from Porsche the other day, and
came across "changes" to the ESPN schedule for Supercup races...
Spain's already been broadcast, but...
Monaco - Saturday, July 8, 2:30pm EDT (Eastern ? Time? dunno)

If I can find the entire schedule, I'll post it... Oh, in case it wasn't

The alternator problem Armand was describing sounds all to familiar to me. My
85 911 had the same symptoms shortly after I purchased it. It had 56k on the
clock when it started to have dimmed lights at idle but ok at higher revs.
 Some 400 miles from home the car failed to crank over after stopping for
fuel. After recharging the battery and getting to my destination I removed
the alternator and pulled the brushes out and found one of them was alot
shorter than the other. The communtater (wasn't in Websters) was delaminating
and tore up the brush. Stuttgart Service of Williamsburg Va. helped me locate
a replacement unit.  It was delivered the next day and I had my Porsche back
on the road again. I missed Porsche in Flight at Williamsburg but enjoyed
driving my 911 around Williamsburg the rest of the week.

Well, where's it coming from?  Do you have a leaking balance shaft or
cam seal, pushing oil under the timing belt cover and from there vented
into the air box?  Or what?

A bit of advice, if I may.  When buying older Porsche's (I'm a 914 freak 
myself) I always budget $500 for a short trip to the West Coast -- spend 
a four day weekend with your cash-in-hand.  You can be assured of getting 
a rust-free, clean car, and as the Californians are more car-crazy than 
we out East are, you tend to get a fairly well maintained car.

A stock 3.2 makes... what?  About 210 HP?  The 901 gearbox is more than 
adequate for this type of duty, unless you're planning on drag-racing 
your car or something (the 901's first gear is a pretty weak design 
even for a stock 2-liter 914/6).

You may want to add a transmission oil cooler, but even without it, the 
901 should be just fine.

Besides, the 901 has a larger selection of gear sets, doesn't require 
questionable third-party adapters to make it work in a 914, and is 
pretty cheap to rebuild if it ever does develop a problem.

Personal testimonial:  My car, with more horsepower than that 3.2, has 
a 901 with about 30K miles since it was regeared (AA-F-L-S-X, by the 
way... Seems to be the hot ticket for Weber-carbed 2.7 Carrera RS 
motors in street cars), and it's as good as new.  Also -- although I 
know it may have little to do with street-car reliability -- all the 
successful 914/6 racers I know use 901s (with coolers).

As usual, this is just my opinion... If you have money burning a hole 
in your pocket, and you want it to burn in George Vellios' instead, buy 
his 916 kit and drop a 915 tranny into your car.

Subject: 951 valve job cost

Now that I've got the head off on my badly sputtering 951, it looks like I
need a valve job instead of just a head gasket.  The reason for my lack of
compression for cylinder #2 is a rather crispy and half-moon shaped exhaust
valve. 

The rest of the head looks pretty good from the outside, so what is a
reasonable cost for replacing 1 exhaust valve and machining the rest? I
gather this should be possible as long as the other valves are OK.  Also,
I'll be replacing the valve guides and seals - anything else that should be
replaced to freshen it up?

Jay,

You didn't mention your mileage, but if you're in this far, I would recommend
that you have the head reconditioned...

1) check for warpage and resurface as necessary.

2) new guides and seals

3) regrind valves and seats as necessary

4) zyglo for cracks, etc...

Also, on the 944 Turbo heads, make sure that the ceramic inserts in the 
exhaust ports have
not come loose...

This should run you about $500 plus parts...
Good Luck!

P-Filers,

Picked this up on the net:

"As per 9/18/95 R-406A has been approved as a replacement for R-12 in
automotive applications."
As you may know, this compound is more eficient than R-12 and fullly
compatible. It was invented @ People's Welding Supplies and approved for all
applications except automotive. The only requirement seems to be a strong
suggestion to change to barrier hoses as R-406A will leak out a little faster
than R-12. The same regulations as for R-12 may apply. This may be a better

I like my SC despite the high miles, but my suggestion would be, if you have
$20k to spend, look at 3.2L Carreras and, as usual, buy the newest, lowest
miles one you can get with your available funds. When you first look at
Carrera prices they seem high, but keep looking, there are good cars out
there well under $20k.

  I have a 1969 911S that is completely Euro.  The car came into the States
about 1970.  I have never had a problem with Legality in the 20 years I have
been driving.  Although I have not checked with anyone.

  The only problems have been that the len seals on the Euro units are
different than the US units.  So after 20 years I donot have good seals.

And then a final question about having the oil in the filter drain back 
through the engine. This sounds like a good solution but is it the clean 
or dirty side of the oil filter that is draining back through the engine?

Subject: 914 intermittent miss

Hey everybody!  Got a question about my '74 914 1.8L.  I just got back 
from a 300 mile trip to my parent's home this weekend when my car 
developed some interesting problems.
1.  The engine started to randomly cut out(like the ignition was being 
switched off) and then would come back as fast as it went away.  This 
happened on the way out of Ann Arbor on Friday night so I checked all of 
the electrical connections and found a real loose coil wire.  I crimped 
the connector to tighten it up and continued the trip with no problems.
Today the car started to pull the same crap on the way home coming 
through the irish hills, but had modified itself.
2.  Now, the car misfires above 4000 rpm consistently.

I don't have time to look it over tonight, but I am hoping that someone 
can give me a suggestion where to look first when I tear into it tomorrow 
after work.  Thank you for any help you can give!

I may be wrong, but I thought that the engine would run if it was missing
the speed sensor - the only problem is that the DME defaults to the idle
program. It is the TDC sensor that needs to be in place for the engine to
run ...

The sensors actually produce a voltage, and are best measured on a scope
where the waveform can be observed. The factory manuals have specific
instructions about how to do this.

Subject: 912E questions - bucking and fuel pump location

     
     The fuel pump of the 912E is above the plate, which is under the car, 
     just under the driver side footwell.  You will find the master 
     cylinder and the reset switch there too.  The plate is removed by 
     removing a few screws which hold the plate.
     
     As to the bucking bronco 912E, you did not state at what RPM the 
     bucking started -- my did the same at 5600 (?) RPM -- the limiter 
     switch cut off the ignition. Maybe yours is loose!!!  Does it do it 
     with the car stopped and the engine speeded up the  same RPM??  If it 
     does, use a timing light to see if the  spark goes away when the 
     bucking starts.
     
     I would also check for loose wires at the coil connections.
     
     It could also be fuel problems -- change the fuel filter in the engine 
     compartment -- left side.  Finally put a pressure gauge in fuel line, 
     and watch the pressure -- I believe it has to be 24 lbs.  This is a 
     tricky test, and you better assure that the connections are tight, 
     otherwise you will have a flame-up, and you will have to get the 
     insurance to buy your wife a new car!!!  If your car bucks standing 
     still at some RPM, and you observe the fuel pressure, and it does not 
     drop, it has to be the ignition.
     
     Good luck

Subject: Re: Air Conditioning a 912

    The Factory DID Air Condition 912's- usually for Texas and Arizona. The
kit was,  as I understand it, a Dealer-installed Option which required a
massive bracket on the left-hand side of the engine (replacing the left-hand
intermediate motor mount). It also required that a second pulley be added to
the crank pulley (and in the case of the '68 912 with already had  a 2-pulley
pulley, required a THREE pulley-pulley. One for the generator belt, one for
the air pump belt and one for the compressor. 
     The compressor also make access to the distributor, coil, oil filter,
etc difficult. Needless to say, this was not a popular option from the
mechanic's point of view- or anyone  who worked on the car.
    I've  seen several 912's with the remains of the A/C system (notably the
huge left-hand motor mount), but only a couple working examples.  Despite
Stan's claim of imminent motor demise, the 912's I've seen with working A/C
systems suffered no crankshaft failures from the compressor mounting. (Those
two middle mains in a 912 are Steel-backed- just like 'Merican cars).
    And yes, you WILL get poorer performance with A/C and though YOU may be
cooler, the engine will run hotter!
    All in all, I'd forget about putting A/C into a 912. Open the windows or
pour water over yourself- ala the "swamp cooler" technique- one which I used
 again today when coming back from the Sacramento Swap Meet in 107 degree
temperatures down I-5 at 80mph (average traffic speed) in my non-Air
Conditioned '69 Chevy Peek-up Truck, loaded with complete Super-90 Engine
 and enough parts  to build  a second 356 engine. God, it was hot!  But a
cup-full  of ice water liberally applied to one's t-shirt at 10 minute
intervals made the trip survivable.
   KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!

P.S. The Swap Meet sucked- everyone left by 11 AM 'cause of  the heat.

Subject: 9 1 4  Audio Improvements


To put it bluntly, the stereo system in my 914 is less than adequate.
However, this is actually my fault, as I have spent time attending to other
more important areas of the car (mechanics).  Now that some of those items
have been improved somewhat, I started to think about a sound system.

The interior possibilities for some type of stereo upgrade seem to me to be
rather lackluster and limited, IMHO.  Now I do not want to push so much air
inside of the car that I can blow out the windows, rather do some smart
things that will allow me to have some nice music on, as well as perhaps
lessen road noise.

Thus, without anyone getting too specific, are there any suggestions -
i.e., speaker types and placement, sound proofing or otherwise - for
improving my 914's sound system?

I appreciate any advice!

ref 914s
I don't think there was ever a uk spec 914 ?? I may be wrong but I have 
never seen one - there may be a couple of conversions running around

ref cd numbers

just because you can light a cig at 70 doesn't mean it is slick, it just 
means that you are sitting in dead air.

In fact slab fronted motors often have better cd figs than sleak roadsters

the UK ford transit van had a better cd than a ford mustang

long cars always have better cd figs than short cars

the alfa romeo guilietta of 1995 and the citroen ds both had cds around .22 

formula 1 cars are generally > .50 

finally refember you must multiply the cd by the cross sectional area to 
get the drag, and big cars with low cds will still have more drag than 
914s with high cds

Hi all,

Mid-spring I reported my 356 to be finished welded and complete body
restored,...somewhere along the road I changed opinion and decided to
replace the rocker panels too.

This showed up to be a wise move,...when I started drilling out the
spot welds the assembly revealed smaller rust holes between the spot
welds. I ended up using a 0.5" x 0.5" 90 degree angled piece of
sheetmetal, welding it onto the sill to get an edge for the rocker
panel.

The rocker panels goes far up on both front and rear fender, and these
areas improved a lot with the new rockers.

The job itself was very easy and I will write it down and include
photos in the DIY 356 manual I'm happy enough to set up at tta.com.

I had the same problem with my 951. Turned out to be a (very slightly) bent
front wheel. I described the exact same symptoms to my local Porsche tech
(unsoliced testimonial: the guys @ Princeton Porsche are some of the very
best!) and he knew right away. It was a small enough ding that I would
never have noticed it had I not gone looking for it.

something and then smoothly completes going into 5th. I don't have
a problem with any of the other gears. It seems to happen at any speed.
It gets stuck just past neutral, then the rest of the throw is OK.

Could this be a clutch problem? A transmission problem?

Any ideas would be appreciated?

Subject: 911SC idle fluctuating/stalling

Hello,

Sometimes, after driving for a while, my 1981 911SC idle fluctuates up 
and down and sometimes even down so low it stalls, apparently only after 
the engine is hot, and I have been driving it for a while.   

For instance, after driving on a highway for a while, and then when
I pull onto the exit ramp, and put it in netutral, the engine will
stall out, or the idle will begin going up and down as if a ghost
is revving the accelerator up to maybe 3000-3500 RPM, and then down to
below normal idle, to about 500 RPM's.  Up and down, up and down, etc.

It keeps bobbing up and down unless I hold the accelerator pedal down 
slighty and keep it at maybe 2000 RPM.  Many times it stalls after a 
few of these fluctuations up and down if I do nothing.  This does not 
always happen either, only a few times in the past week, and there are
no problems under acceleration or normal driving in gear, only at idle.
What shall I look at to figure this one out?  Thanks.

I just got a '90 C2 as well and guess what? Wanders like hell!! I noticed that
the PO had the front-end aligned at 7,000 miles, so maybe it wandered on
him too! I was just about to take it in to do the same, but now I'm
starting to wonder :)  if maybe this is a common problem with C2's. My
wheels are stock and tires are Pirelli's (well worn). 

Maybe its a steering system problem with a linkage, tie-rod, damper or 
something.

Anyone else with a C2/C4 have an opinion?

First, say something *nice* to Stan, and to our webmaster, Derek Cahill 
<cahilld@freenet.scri.fsu.edu>, for making so much neat stuff available on the
web.

The BMW list can be joined by sending a message to BMW: 
bmw-request@balltown.cma.com

Other Porsche pages can be accessed from Porschephiles home page: 
http://tta.com/Porschephiles, or directly from

Dennis,

You put the seal onto the quarter glass, then lay a thin rope into the
seal.  And then you push the window into position and gradually pull the
rope out, which as it comes out flips the seal into position.

Sound confusing?  Yep.  Tricky?  Yep.  It's one of those things which
an experience body shop guy can do in a snap, while mere mortals curse
and swear for the better part of an hour!  Get someone to show you.

Hi,

	I am intersted in putting the later headlight, which I thought were
called H5's, on my 911. ('72 T)  What headlights will or will not fit
my baby?  Is there a canonical list of lights, suchs as H1,H4 and H5?  My
SO has H4's on her BMW (put on there myself, actually) and they don't look
anything like what I've heard referred to as H4's on a 911 (duh)

Subject: Re: Do I have bad clutch?

Ray,

If your clutch has blown its rubber centre, you will feel a single thunk
as you come off idle and onto the gas, and you will feel the same thunk
in the opposite transition.

If you feel a lot of bucking any time you get on the gas, it's probably
something else.  I'd look at the air flow meter, throttle switch (idle
and WOT switches), fuel filter/pressure, and for vacuum leaks.

Hope this helps.

The "classic" cause of this it the throttle switch.  (flat black thing
on the side of the throttle body.)  They respond well to a good cleaning,
but be careful not to move the adjustment.

This sounds more like a distributor problem.  Either there is a lot
of shaft-wobble, or the injection points are starting to go.

Or it could need a *really* good tune-up.

PORSCHING  by Chris Welty
Hudson-Champlain Region, PCA

When You Wish Upon A Star - Part VII

The funny thing about hearing my own voice from across the span of
time was that it was very clear.  Not only that, but while my voice
did change during puberty, I was never a soprano.  "Huh?" I said,
awakened from my revelry. 

The waitress motioned with her head towards the Porsche that had just
pulled into the parking lot.  "I just said that I wish I had a
Porsche.  Doesn't everyone?"  She deposited the check on the table and
left. 

Sometimes the deepest wisdom can be found in the most unexpected
places.  I am quite sure there are little kids in Japan who grow up
hoping one day to own a Nissan, but from my slanted view of the world,
most people dream about Porsches, and the 911 is the most eminently
recognizable car on the planet.  Everyone who sees one either says,
"Hey, nice car!" or pretends not to be impressed.  Before I had one, I
was in the latter category... 

The next morning we awoke bright and early to the sound of Steve
yelling at his girlfriend.  I stumbled around in a stupor for a while,
trying to remember what debauchery we had engaged in the previous night
that had caused me to pass out on the floor.   My memory returned in
stages, as happens when I am suddenly yanked to consciousness in
strange surroundings.   Steve yelling at someone was such a familiar
stimulus from college that my mind had grasped onto that.  Eventually
I remembered that I wasn't in college anymore, and that I was supposed
to be sleeping on the floor, though I was never able to explain why I
was wearing a grass skirt. 

Steve's girlfriend's addiction to game shows and her fascination with
the pilot light on the stove were a constant source of amusement for
us.  When Steve came out of the bedroom that morning, it was clear
that after some time living with her these endearing qualities had
lost their initial charm.  He was becoming especially frustrated with
the fact that she had graduated law school a year ago and still
thought she could make big bucks as a contestant on game shows rather
than getting a job as a lawyer.  This had, in fact, been the subject
of the morning's fracas, and Steve asked, in that "She made me ask you
this question and I really hope you say no" kind of voice, whether we
could give her a ride to Hollywood to try out as a contestant on
Jeopardy.  We somehow felt guilty about the friction, so we agreed,
though on the drive over we all felt very uncomfortable.  We were
quite relieved to resume our quest.   

We must have seen another ten cars that day, and each one in my
category made it even more clear that the car John had said I would
buy was the one for me.  Karl however, was starting to feel lonely. 

It was sometime after lunch that we visited a `78 SC at a location
near the beach.  The owner was young, younger than us, with long hair
and met us wearing a bathing suit.  We really thought he was the most
stereotypically Californian person we'd met until his friend showed
up.  This guy had bleached blond hair and a very dark tan, and at
first when he spoke we thought he was joking.  I suppose in order for
someone to make fun of that speech pattern there has to be a few
people who actually talk that way, dude.  I am telling the absolute
truth when I say he was carrying a surfboard.

The car was a dark greenish blue.  To me it was more green, but I seem
to be alone in the world in that opinion, everyone else said blue.  It
had enormous tires on color matched 15" BBS rims.  Many people update
their SCs to "sevens and eights", but this car had eights and nines,
and the 15" rims made them look all the wider.  Karl was in love.  He
was all over the car, and though he found several problems with it,
including a pretty nice sized transmission oil leak, he wanted the
car.  Karl knew a lot about cars, and a lot about Porsches, but there
was no question he was seduced by the big fat tires.  Once in a bar a
group of us college guys had been talking about favorite body parts,
and I distinctly remember being confused by his statement, "I like
them BIG but low profile." 

"That car has bitchin' tires," observed Mr. California.

My jaw dropped, and I noted John also wore an expression of shocked
surprise.  This was more than I could take.   

"Bitchin?  Did you actually say `Bitchin'? " I stammered. 

"Yaa, "  he looked momentarily confused, even in pain.  "You, like,
you don't think so?" 

"Definitely," said John. "Bitchin.  Totally bitchin.  Awesome."

A wave of relief passed over the guys face, and he began to nod with a
bobbing motion.  "Yaaaaa," he said, with feeling.  Then his face
changed again, this time to wonderment.  "Whooaaaa." 

We followed his gaze and discovered that Karl had just put on the
stethescope.  The two natives watched in awe. Flies eventually began
to dart in and out of their gaping mouths.  The owner looked nervous.
"I drive it out on the beach sometimes," he managed, spitting out a
stray insect. 

Karl's total infatuation with the tires was revealed at that moment to
the qualified observer - he was trying to listen to them.  John and I
stood back because we were now more interested, in an anthropological
sort of way, in the bitchin' friend.  The two of us were trying our
best to shatter what we firmly believed was a charade.  Our study,
unfortunately, was ended prematurely when I mistakenly uttered,
"Surf's up!" and our subject darted off to the nearby beach. 

"Had to be an act," John said, watching him disappear over a dune.

"Probably just some actor practising for a part in a B beach movie," I
offered. 

"Had to be.  Did you notice the makeup job?"

"Yes, very realistic, I wonder who did it."  I believe that John was
as deeply disturbed by the experience as I was, and through some
unspoken sympathy we never spoke of the incident again.  We turned our
attention back to Karl's newfound love.  That is, his newfound loves.

Karl had begun negotiating and it looked as if, once again, he would
need our help.  I like to share with my readers bits of the wisdom I
have gathered over my many years, and here's a particular little gem:
If you're emotionally involved in something you shouldn't be
negotiating about it.  Karl was clearly in violation of this rule.
The owner had started off at $14K and Karl had already haggled it up
to $16K.  

I was just about to step in when John, who had gone over to inspect
the car for himself, called us over.  He was knelt beside the right
rear tire, and for a moment I though perhaps he had succumbed to the
madness that was clearly possessing Karl.  Thankfully, this was not
the case, and he pointed at the tread when he said, "The tire's
rubbing."   

Karl and I bent over to look at what John was pointing at.  About two
centimeters in from the outside of the tire was a gouge about half a
centimeter deep that went all around the tire.  Karl straightened up
suddenly and let out a wail that would have impressed any banshees
surfing nearby.  The sonic blast loosened about a ton of sand which
spilled onto the ground like some bizarre hourglass.  It would be
difficult to exaggerate the amount of sand stuck in this car.  My
first impression was that the guy carried a beach around with him in
case he ever needed one. 

It was clear that the tires were too big for the car, and that
whenever it hit a bump they would rub against the underside of the
fender.  "I wonder how long it's been doing that?" wondered the owner,
in that innocent, "gee, I never noticed THAT before,"  kind of voice
that is so common in these circumstances.  John pointed out that the
contact point on the underside of the fender was worn down to bare
metal, indicating that it hadn't "just started." 

I stood up and made to leave, but to my surprise, it seemed that this
incident had not deterred Karl from his desire to own the car.  At the
very least there was a positive effect: he was negotiating in the
correct direction.  The owner was holding firm, however.  Ultimately
he was unimpressed by our knowledge of what was wrong with the car,
claiming that if he just waited around, eventually, "some guy would
come along who didn't know better and buy it for his wife." 

Hey, if someone did that for me, I'd marry him.

We started to leave. Karl, with tears in his eyes, had to be dragged
from the tires.  We drove away to our next appointment. 

"Do you think they were worth $13.5?" he asked.

"I don't know, Karl," I said.  "That was a pretty big transmission
leak.  Do you think it will make it across the country like that?" 

Karl shrugged.  "Ja.  Ja, I drove a car clear across Germany once with
no clutch and only fourth gear."  It was repeated stories like these
that had built my confidence over the course of our adventure that the
choice to drive the cars back hadn't been, as I had originally feared,
a mistake of a magnitude that would have motivated the ancient Greeks
to write a play.  

"What about the tires?  At that rate they'll wear through to the belts
before you get halfway there."  John, always the voice of reason, had
also decided he would not accompany us on the Odessian drive back,
preferring to use all three return flight tickets for himself. 

Karl remained silent, sullen.  His repertoire of stories about the
automotive obstacles he'd overcome did not seem to cover this.  It was
one of the few situations that Speed Racer had seen and Karl hadn't.
After a long silence, he spoke.  "Ja.  I will buy that car.  Do you
think they will be allright tonite?  Do you think he will drive them?"

When we returned that night to Steve's house I called Chuck, the owner
of the blue '71T we had looked at the previous day.  He accepted my
offer of $6500.  Jubilant, Karl and I could think of little else.
For the first time that trip, the three of us stayed at Steve's
apartment for the evening, but neither Karl nor I were much company.
We spent the time poring over maps trying to pick the best route home.
This suited Steve well, he loved talking about highways, almost as
much as the British. 

That night I was too excited to sleep, though I tried to look drowsy
in the hope that Steve would stop talking about the relative merits of
Interstate 40.  He finally retired to his bedroom, and we tried to get
some rest.  A cloud of doubt crossed my mind - there was still the
open question of money.   Money, money, money.  Doubt turned to
anxiety - would the stars see to it that no snags showed up in the two
rather bizarre mechanisms Karl and I had used to get our money from
New York to L.A.?  What about our safety? We would be carrying between
the two of us well over $20K in CASH. I lay awake most of the night
imagining all the possible complications, and then all the things
that might go wrong in driving two old cars 3000 miles across the
country.

Subject: Non-starting  DMEs


George,

You know, a few years back, when I was fooling around with a non-
starting 944, I discovered that our German friends routed the 12Volt 
line from the ignition switch to the coil, then back to the DME. 

The DME has one board (most do, 944S does not) that switches the 12V to 
ground. The trigger signal comes from the Computer itself, it is delayed
or advanced as the MAP directs.

Anyway, the point is that anyone that is experiencing a non-start with 
no fire from the ignition should first check to see if there is 12V at
the coil with the ignition switch on. The problem with the car in 
question was traced to an aftermarket alarm system that broke the power 
to the coil. A good idea, very poorly executed. Removel of the alarm
circuitry and reconnection of the wires to their normal configuration
allowed this car to start and run correctly.

The antenna coax comes out behind the radio, and this other wire is

Subject: Translation of Paul Foster's post

     Why I got this uuencoded, I don't know. I've translated it, so
everyone might see:



     I did my first PCA track event this weekend at Bridgehampton on Long

     Island. It was a three day event with 4 sessions per day of about 20

     minutes per session.



     The first session, the instructor took it out first for two relatively

     slow laps to show me the track (Chip Brown, 944 Turbo pilot

     extraordinare). When it was my turn, I was all over the place, and he

     almost grabbed the steering wheel. Afterwards, I wasn't sure I wanted

     to be there. The front straight is really scary. It is about 3800 ft.

     long, and it goes steeply downhill the last 400-500 feet before

     sweeping to the right and going even more downhill. Cohoneville, USA.



     It all clicked in the second session once I go familiar with the track

     and the speed (2.8 miles and 13 turns). In the third session, I passed

     2 930s, 1 Testarossa, and 1 308 (My car has 145HP on a good day). In

     the fifth session, the instructor "signed me off", and I changed run

     groups and "soloed" in the seventh session (it was raining during the

     sixth session, and I wanted another set of eyes). In the eighth

     session, I must have passed everybody in the group!



     The Blue Laws don't allow anybody to have fun on Sunday until 1 PM, So

     they had a track walk that was very informative. It's amazing what you

     don't see at 120+ (the front AND back straights). When I went through

     tech, the Safety Nazi didn't like the feel of the left front when he

     was checking the lug nut tightness. I jacked it up, and sure enough,

     the rear bushing on the LF A-arm was shot. The A-arm rattled with

     moderate hand pressure. What a bummer. Being relatively adult, I

     managed to walk away with no acrimony or crying. However the mechanic

     who did the four-wheel alignment and pretrack tech inspection is going

     to have some explaining to do...



     I am well and truly hooked. Now all I have to do is come up with a way

     to get my hands on a lot of money. I think any proficient autocrosser

     is going have a relatively easy transition to the OTHER auto sport. I

     also think some proficiency at autocrossing should be required. The

     instructors are incredibly brave (stupid?) to get into the passenger

     seat with a complete stranger.



     This was a joint event with the Ferrari and BMW clubs. There were 2

     F40s in attendance. All the Ferrari drivers were slow. The F40s ran in

     the instructors group (I guess so they wouldn't get punted off). They

     were very slow in the corners, and the guys would punch it down the

     straights & not let the Porsches pass them. There was a modified 914

     in that group that sticked to an F40's tail down the front straight,

     which caused one of the pit wall wags to comment: "That sure would

     make a good picture. A 914 eating up an F40!" I was wearing a Ferrari

     hat most of the weekend, so most everybody thought I was one of them,

     instead of actually piloting a beaten-up '84 944 with 135K miles.

My roommate has cought Porsche fever(I think my 928 is extremely contagious)
and has been looking at a couple of cars this weekend.  The one he is leaning
towards is a '96 944 turbo that is supposedly in great condition and has all
service records.  The guy says that everything is working fine, but that it
is about time to replace the water pump.  Does this cost as much as it does
on a 928?  It has 95K miles and the guy wants $9,000 for it.  My roommate
says that he really justs wants it to take to the track- so should he hold
out for a turbo S?  Although, he really doesn't want to spend more than $9K.
Is the 944 turbo the worst older Porsche to insure?  Should he just get a
normally aspirated 944/24 and tweek it(they are about half the price).
Thanks for any help!  Sean  '80 928

Subject: Nuts!


  Hey P-filers,

  This weekend, I was replacing my transmission gear oil with nice new
  Swepco, when upon removing the magnetic drain plug I had one of those
  moments that sends shivers up one's spine. There, clinginging to the
  plug, was a nut, slightly gnawed on one side. Upon seeing this, I
  proceeded in a semi-trancelike state into the house, my jaw still
  dragging behind me. I showed it to Shelle, amidst mumblings to the effect
  that this was Not A Good Thing. She recommended that I have a beer and
  relax, which was actually very good advice, which I dutifully followed.
  After sitting down with a Hank's (Henry Weinharts Private Reserve, for
  all those non-western cheap beer connoisseurs) and poring over my brand
  new factory manuals (thanks dear, great birthday present! I swear my wife
  is psychic), I could not figure out where in the hell this nut came from.
  Having reached the limits of my knowledge, I am asking for any help
  available from you folks.

  Here is what I know:      915 transmission. 73 911T with '83 SC engine.
  The nut is the same exact one that is used to keep the differential cover
  on ( self-locking nut, M8 X 1.25 thread). There doesn't appear to be
  significant damage to the differential or case (some scratches, no
  chipped teeth on ring/pinion or others on diff). I know that there is no
  nut like this in the differential, and I don't see how it could have
  gotten there from another part of the transmission.

  Could the nut in fact have gotten to the differential from another part
  of the transmission, or was it likely left by a careless mechanic
  sometime in the cars recent past?

  Any and all help on this matter will be profoundly appreciated.

nice and there was never a dull moment.  My friends had never been to the

Subject: 912 Purchase; Road Trip

Well, I can say safely that if it were not for the people who make up this 
list, I would not be the very happy, new owner of a very clean '67 912, 
purchased 2,500 miles from home! My list-supporting check will go out to Bart 
Chambers by Friday. Although there are numerous posters who helped further my 
p-car technical education (and helped me determine the right car for my desires
and budget) I would like to say special thanks to the following people who 
helped guide me through the three-month consideration, inspection, and purchase
of this auto:

To Ted Smith, for graciously providing me with a thorough, thoughtful, and 
dead-accurate appraisal of the car overall;

To Harry Pellow, for checking the engine, and for writing highly entertaining 
understand it/fit it literature;

To Stan Hanks for his committment, and most recently for the brief treatise on 
Solex vs. Weber carbs (my car has the original Solex carbs; I had an 
opportunity to purchase Webers; decided to pass on them);

To Ted Rogers, Bill Hutton, Sean Steinmann, Scott Berry, Michael Hodos, and 
Matt Safranski for willingness to help, words of advice, and of caution;

....And to the 912's 2 PO's who did what was needed to keep the car this good 
after 28 years.

With the assistance of those mentioned above, several pictures, and lots of 
E-Mail between me and the PO, I arranged to purchase the car in Berkeley, 
California from my home in Granville, Ohio - flew out there to 
sightsee/visit/pick it up, and (drumroll, please....) drove it 2,500 miles back
to Ohio without major incident (and WITH lots of fun)! A special pitch for 
Dieter Mees of D+M motors in Channing, who I have never met, but who maintained
the car regularly and prepped it for the trip. The only problem I had was a 
recalcitrant starter when warm (sticky brushes, I expect - will replace it this
week, probably); otherwise, NO hassles! Engine ran smoothly, only used 1/2 
quart of oil the entire trip; even made it throug the Longest Day (16 hours/900
miles continuous running) without missing a beat! Try that in your 28 year old 
(insert name other than well-cared for Porsche)!

If there is interest I may add details of the trip in a future post; now on to 
a couple of questions for the group:

1) Can anybody transfer to me the relevant files from the FAQ? Please, just let
me know if you can do this, rather than doing it, so I only end up with one set
of FAQ's. I don't have the capability to browse, use WWB, or HMTL(?) yet.

2) I plan on doing as much of the routine tuning and repair as I can (it is a 
pleasure to have a real, mechanical machine to work on for a change); I have a 
few questions on carb tools:

a) to Synch the carbs, I'm thinking of picking up a unisyn, or should I invest 
in something different/fancier? If so, what? from where?

b) is it worth my while to track down a float level gauge and accelerator pump
vial (if I can?) The settings seem fine for now, though - how often should I
check? Recommendations on best literature to learn about ajusting the soli's?

c) Anybody with a personal recommendation re: a shop to rebuild the solex's?
It's been suggested that I probably have worn throttle shafts, butterflies; not
too bad for now, more likely a winter project.

The car is virtually rust-free (and is definately so in all the "important" 
places); later this summer I'll see about removing peeling original 
undercoating from the upper areas of the rear quarters; any recommendations on 
emulsifier/treatments (was thinking about POR 15 or wurths as treatment) would 
also be appreciated.

BTW, when I got the car home (did the trip SOLO) my 2yr old daughter 
immediately claimed the car as her own....and even my wife likes it!

Thanks, everybody. Look forward to talking with you regularly.

Subject: Re: Headlights

The designation H4, H5 etc refers to the bulb standard, not the lens and 
reflector assembly. So a H4 light for a BMW is really a BMW reflector/lens which 
takes a standard H4 two filament replaceable bulb as its light source. Similarly 
the H4 for a 911 is a big bloody light, 9" across which uses a H4. 

I ahve the H4 lights on my 911, they are good, but my bet is that they are not 
as good as the H1 lights which have a separate bulb and reflector for low and 
high beam instead of the single light bulb in the H4/H5. Price is a factor 
though, and  I am not too sure on availability.

My advice....get rid of those sealed beams and enjoy an enlightened world, exact 
type is not supercritical....

Subject: RE>914 sound system



In responce to Patrick's quest for a 914 sound system I have a few
suggestions.  The best system I've seen in a 914 (according to my judgement)
was done as follows.
                    1>a new center console was made which looked just like
                      the original, but was actualy a sealed housing for a
                      'Kicker'solo-baric 8''subwoofer (designed for small
                      enclosures) which faced toward the passenger side.

                    2>carpeted enclosures housing 6.5'' component sets were
                      constructed and placed in the factory speaker locations
                      and are only slightly more obtrusive than the factory
                      plastic housings.

                    3>a cd player resides in the factory dash location
                      (only slightly closer to the driver than the passenger
                      side window crank, ha ha.)

                    4>an amp and cross-over hide in the console/enclosure.

I am more into driving than I am into stereos, so I like this set-up because
it is simple, discrete and yet it sounds wonderful. The only thing it lacks
 is a dash control for the sub-woofer, since lows are more pronounced when
 the top is off the car.

            Hope this gives you some ideas.

Subject: C2 Running HOT

I have a '90 C2, this weekend I took it for a drive up to Napa Valley.
This saturday it was about 105 degreees up there.... I didn't use the A/C at
all because the car was getting hot, pinned as close to the red zone as it could.
Anyway finally the red light came on(overheated), but luckily I was
very close to the first wineyard. 20 minutes later the engine had cooled
down a bit and I went to the next place. The engine got up to the red again,
and I just turned in to the next place..... After this the car never got up
in the red zone again, but were as close as it could be all the way home.


My question is: is this normal with the C2?, I thought that this was more of
a problem with the older 911.

Everything in the engine compartment looked fine, is there anything special
to check?, or improve to cool it down?

What driving style cools it down best? 3000rpm in 5th?, 2500rpm in 5th?,
3000rpm in 4:th?.

How much impact do the A/C have on overheating? I mean the only time you want to
use it is when it's very warm outside, and then the car might overheat.....

Anyway I'm glad I put in the Mobil-1 synthetic oil last week.

Thanks!

ps.

I saw about a dozen stranded cars on the way home, a few air-cooled VW,
VW busses, I guess this kind of heat was new.
Everything else was a success.....

Porsche Supercup Returns to U.S. Television in 1995

RENO, NEVADA, May 10, 1995 --- Porsche Cars North America today announced
the 1995 Porsche Supercup Championship will be televised in the U.S. over
the ESPN cable sports television network. It marks the second-straight year
ESPN has telecast the Porsche Supercup to U.S. households.

Lingner Group Productions of Indianapolis will again produce each of the
nine race broadcasts plus a season wrap-up program. All of these half-hour
telecasts will be seen once on ESPN and at least twice on ESPN 2. Veteran
motor sports announcer Marty Reid returns as the Championship host.

Now in its third year, the Porsche Supercup Championship is run in
conjunction with nine European World Championship Formula One Grand Prixs
 - -- San Marino, Spain, Monaco, France, Great Britain, Germany, Hungary,
Belgium and Europe (Nurburgring). Drivers from seven European countries
will contest the entire 1995 series in cars fielded by some of that
continent's top sports car racing teams. In addition, several well-known
North American drivers are expected to compete in individual races at the
controls of Porsche factory "guest" cars.

All cars entered in the Supercup Championship are identically equipped and
based on the highly popular 1995 Porsche 911 Carrera. Changes in the
race-prepared Carreras for the 1995 Championship include the addition of a
huge fixed rear wing and new front spoiler, enhanced suspension and a
shortened sixth gear for added performance at very high speeds. These
modifications have resulted in a car that is faster yet easier to drive
than last year's version.

Agreed, and there isn't much room for improvements without major surgery

Patrick,
     When I adressed this problem, my first rule was that I was not going
to seriously modify the 914 for a better stereo. I quickly realized that
some type of compromise would be needed for decent sound. In my case, I
chose a little less leg room. What I did was to place two, box three way
speakers with honeycomb woofers (for space conservation, yet still able
to move air), horn midrange and piezo tweeters behind each seat. Thus,
the seats are moved forward about 6 inch's (I'm 6' and really notice it,
but the tradeoff was worth it). I then installed a 50 watt per channel
amp under the dash on the passengers side and connected it to a decent
receiver/cd player in the dash. All pretty non intrusive and it sounds
good even with the top off!
This setup won't win your local distorted rap thump thump contests, but
it gives the 914 good sound with minimal tradeoff.   Good luck.

I don't think it makes any significant difference.

I generally figure that any loss in acceleration is offset by 
the gains in braking and turn-in.

I don't go out with less than half a tank because sometimes I'll 
use a quarter tank during the event ('80 'sc) and then I want to

My experience is that the water-pump is inexpensive compared to the cost
of getting at the thing to replace it (unless of course, you do it
yourself).  Your friend might consider replacing the timing/balance belts
while he's in there...seems to me you have to go through this stuff to get
at the pump...? 

Anyway, several design changes were implemented beginning in 1987, so I 
would encourage your friend to find an '87+ 944 Turbo.

That's my $0.02 on the matter.

some air still circulates thru the cabin, and is scorching.

I've checked all the fuses & they're OK. I don't have the equipment to

Dear P-Phillers
  FYI, National Public Radio's Click and Clack the Tappet brother's "Good 
News Garage" used to be a fee-for-space facility back in the late '70s.  
You'd pay $4.00 per hour for a dry, heated (as necessary) space and 
loaner tools.  A driver's lisence was exchanged for a tool cart, floor 
jack, etc.  It beat the hell out of fixing your heap on the streets of 
the Republic of Cambridge, especially in winter.
   I left town for about three years and upon my return in 1983 called to 
see if they had a dummy load to test my heap's charging system.  When 
I asked what the hourly rate was, foolishly thinking Reganomics had 
driven their fee to $5.00 / hour, Ray replied that they were now at $35.00 
/ hour.  To make a long story short, all the groovey guys and gals who 
worked for the Good News Garage "advising" the shadetree clientel, stole 
them blind (at least tool wise).  It WASN'T the CUSTOMERS.
   So, for those of you interested in such a venture, give Tom and Ray a 
call some Saturday morning.  I'd bet they have some more interesting 
stories to tell.

Check the TurboS prices out. I think your friend will find a good TurboS to be
$6K - $9K over his $9K budget.

Some companies refused to quote me insurance on the 951. Shop around. It's
not too bad. Tweeking of the 944 has been discussed here at length and the
general tone of that particular thread was that there is no way you will
come close to 951 performance for the difference in price between a 951
and a 944 of like years and condition.

Adam, I have a 928, but I'll betcha that the a/c logic is the same in your
car.  On my car this is a symptom of a broken outside temperature sensor wire
(or a dead sensor).  If you're handy and have the trouble shooting bulletin
from Porsche, you can track it down yourself.  But you sound like you need a
fix TODAY.

If you can find the temp sensor, check the continuity of the wires from the
sensor to the plug near your a/c controller.  If one of the lines is open, you
can jury rig a temporary wire to get you through your trip.  I have no idea
what happens if you short out the connector in the car and simply remove the
outside temp sensor from the circuit, but it's worth a try.

I hope a 944-knowledgeable p-philer gives you better advice!

Good luck (I know all about this problem -- BTDT, in the desert, on a very hot

lend me a serious handicap as every one else was racing with BFG R1 
tires(including my competition in BS, which was 5 seconds faster than 
me).  However, it was a great experience full of fun and I feel as if I 
learned a lot.  Here is what I learned:
a) Smoothness is the key.  I never tete-a-que-ed due to spinning the rear 
end out, whereas lots of other drivers did in corners that I found easy, 
some that even had front wheel drive models.  (a CRX almost rolled)  Sure, I 
was going slow given I have not done this before, but not that slow that 
I did not have my chances to royally mess up.
b) It is good to turn in way before the cones in the slalom so that the 
chassis has time to set (give time for the weight transfer to occur).
c) I take my curves way to tight, thus my tires have to work extra hard.  
I need to increase the radius when I turn.  
d) Sheesh, I have never smoked the wheels while shifting to second gear 
before.  The car has more power that I thought.  I need to harness it better.
e) Walk the course more than once, so you can learn it before you drive 
and also plan how you should negotiate it. I walked it only once and as a 
result, I did not know it well and DNF-ed one of my runs as I missed one 
of the gates.  Also, I had lot of problems with a seemingly easy curve 
because I did not plan well.

My auto-x experience also generated questions that I was hoping someone 
in this list may have an answer for.
a) I noticed that a lot of cars were bumping their rev limiters.  The end 
of the auto-x track had a straight run where everyone just floored it on 
second gear.  I am very hesitant to hit the red line.  Should I be?  Or is 
the rev limiter something I should use from time to time?  I feel that my 
fear to mash the pedal on the floor costs me time.
b) How much fuel should I have in the tank?  Should I have little fuel so 
the car can be light or does the extra weight aid in rear whell traction?

The bottom line:  This is FUN, I want MORE.

Hi,
   Well, I bit.  Richard, the owner I suppose, was very convincing on the 
phone.  I had condidered the chipping option and we discussed that.  I 
had also considered the supercharging idea.  But, after talking with 
Richard twice, decided to take the plunge.  It was more (claimed) bang 
for the buck.  Installation was easy.  The short "programming" session 
for the motronic unit to adapt to the powerbox was also easy enough.  
Adjustment of the unit after installation is a breeze.  I just had the 
car "sniffed" for the state inspection and blew a 0.02% CO with about 230 
ppm HC.  Well within the legal limits for NC.
   My impressions:
	1)  While I have not timed or dyno'ed the car, I find it 
            difficult to believe that I have removed 9/10th's of a second 
            from my 0-60 times.  That kind of power increase  should not 
            be so subtle that it takes a machine to tell me that I made a 
            performance improvement.  I'm not saying that it didn't, I 
	    just have not verified it.
	2)  The engine does pull more strongly below 3500 rpm's.  That 
	    part I can tell.  No real rush or anything, I just don't find   
	    myself down-shifting as much.  Drivability has been improved 
	    in that respect.
	3)  I believe, again there's no hard data, that the car runs 
 	    cooler. I am not having to turn the A/C off in stop & go 
	    traffic like last summer.
	4)  I have not noticed any major drop in fuel consumption.  I 
	    figured that the extra fuel pressure should use more fuel.  
            Isn't that the premise of this device in the first place?
   Would I recommend it?  I don't know, certainly not for the price I 
paid: $695.00.  The mfr. realises this as well.  He has dropped the price 
by $200.00.  Against a high performance chip for the same price, I 
suppose that I would opt for this again, but at the $495.00 price.  I do 
not have problems with detonation or hard starts or flat spots and  I can 
dial the pressure up or down as necessary.  I don't have to buy premium 
fuel, though I always do.  If necessary, I can get by on regular in a 
pinch and not worry about potential damage.
   I suppose that I'll have to drive a stock 911 to see (if there's) a real 
difference.  Until then I'll just enjoy my perceived improvements.

My '84 Carrera came with relatively new Goodyear GA's: 215/60/15 front

        As Soren noted earlier, there are trade-offs.  The main thing is
you don't want to run out of fuel.
        As for running with "a ton of crap", you will fail tech locally
if you have *any* loose "crap" hanging around in your trunk.  If you put
stuff up there (including the spare tire!), make sure that it's securely
fastened down.  I think Stan is assuming that everything's secure, but I
personally don't take the time to tie my autoX box and tool boxes down
in my trunk.
        I know people locally who drive the course with their windows
halfway rolled down because they think it's aerodynamically cleaner than
all the way down.  (Our rules specify that the window not be up.)  At
typical autoX speeds, the advantage has got to be un-measurable.  But it's
what they believe in, so they do it.  A full tank vs. an empty tank is
probably not going to have any measurable effect on how you drive until
you've been doing it for a while.  And by the time you can notice it, you
will probably have formed an opinion of the way that *you* like it.

     ***       @ Road America in Elkhart Lake, WI       *** 
     ******************************************************
 
I only spotted 3 Porsches on the race course on Saturday and 
Sunday {I didn't attend Friday's qualifying sessions} all of which 
did quite well. 
 
The best result came in the E-Production final where the 
Quicksilver-sponsored 914-4 of Robert Kirby {Oceanside, CA} took 
top honors in class while placing 3rd overall with a best lap of 
2:38.506 and a speed of 90.848 mph.  Also on the podium for E-Prod 
was Reid Vann {St. Louis, MO} for his 3rd place finish in the Reid 
Vann Luxury Imports-sponsored 356 Speedster. 
 
In the post-race interview, Mr. Kirby said that the MGs in the 
race were all over him in the corners, but he had been able to 
pull away with superior horsepower.  I would concur with his 
assessment.  From my vantage point watching turn 5, the MGs seemed 
to have the better of him, but mid-race an incident elsewhere on 
the track tore the right-rear fender off of his fiercest 
competitor and the Porsche pulled away from then on.  Earlier, he 
and his crew had been forced to swap engines before the final 
after suffering a "slightly bent valve from a slightly missed 
shift" in qualifying. 
 
The 356 ran a consistent and uneventful race dicing primarily with 
competitors of other classes. 
 
The remaining Porsche was the Red Carpet Car Wash GT-2 914-6 of 
Jim Blakewell {Oklahoma City, OK} which finished {unofficially -- 
I didn't hang around for the official results} in second behind 
the Sunbeam Tiger of Tom Patton {Fairfield, OH}.  The race took 
place with GT-1 and GT-3 competitors on the track as well and the 
distance between the Tiger and the 914-6 remained consistent until 
the last couple of laps when Blakewell seemed to make a final push 
only to run out of time. 
 
Maybe next year I can get a press pass as a reporter for 'Porschephiles'.

Subject: Metallic grinding on 944

I think I first heard this today after I hit a small 'speed' bump at 
moderate speed. The sound came from the passenger side
and sounded like a squeaking, metallic, grinding sound which
seemed to pulse (the sound, not the pedal) at a rate dependent
on how fast the wheels were turning. The sound was about 2-3 times
louder than a regular brake squeal, with more emphasis on grinding.
 
The best way I can describe it was that it sounded as though the 
metal backing plate behind the brake disk was rubbing against the
disk (though I know this was not the case).  This continued for about
3 blocks while I drove slowly in 1st gear pressing the brake
intermittently after which it seemed to go away completely.

Any ideas what this might have been??
 
Guesses:

 - Hitting the bump in the road cause the brake pads to go off alignment
  a bit, resulting in the pad rubbing against a high spot on the disk?

 - After hitting the bump, a small pebble or rock got in between the pad
 and disk, causing the grinding sound until the pebble fell out or was worn
 down?
 
These seem kind of improbable to me.

Peter Kauffman kaufpw@ix.netcom.com asked about fuel level in his
'75 Carrera for autocross.

I have always run almost empty (but keep the "empty" idiot light off).
But like Stan I keep the spare in for some low stable weight, and
used to run a huge Gates sealed battery on the passengers side to 
offset the driver's side weight (but now need stock batteries in SCCA).

I think the extra fuel weight may help the front stick, but I'd rather
try to adjust the balance with sway bars and run lighter for acceleration.
I've used supertrap mufflers to reduce the rear weight, although power
may not be as good as a stock muffler (!).

But you may want to try a full tank at the end of the day after you have
fugured out the course and see how it works anyway.

Having never taken one apart, from the descriptions I get I believe them to
be something called a Rising Rate Regulator, that causes the fuel
pressure to go up as the engine goes under load. This delivers more gas
and hence the opportunity for more performance.  Adding these beasties
to DME engiens is sort of iffy, but it's a great win on CIS and L-jet
engines. If I'm right, there's nothing further magic about these
units except watching your money -- nothing up the vendor's sleeve,
PRESTO! It's gone....

Subject: 944 unstable/shaky after tire replacement

Hi all,

Have any of you experienced shaky/unstable 944 above 
~60 mph ? What is going on ?
This past weekend I had my front tires replaced and
rear ones (old) moved to front. They also aligned the
front end. After that the car has been very uncomfortable
to drive, it shakes back and forth when passed over even
small bumps/holes. It is also difficult to keep straight.

I was having the same shaking problem before too, but now
it is unbearable. 

Could it be because of old, possibly unevenly worn out
tires or did they mess up the alignment (which is unlikely
since I was given the computer printout ??

Should I get a set of new tires for the front too ??

I would appreciate if somebody enlightens me..

Thanks a lot.

I only autox with PCA, and they've had some rule changes in my absence (I
was last seriously competing in the '93 season which was a Very Good Year).
Like I actually *DO* have to take out the loose crap from the fron trunk
these days. Ah, safety regulations! I can't complain, I lobbied long and
hard for uniform enforcement of the rules as required by the insurance
carrier, so when it bytes me, that's life. Still run with a full gas
tank (well, at least until I also discover I'm running with a broken
gas cap at which point the tank suddenly tends to become Less Full. But
that's another story...)

I road race in SCCA, and they get a mite testy about carrying crap in the
trunk there...

Subject: RE: surge problems/Service manual

I'm in search of a service manual for my 912E now. I will be changing the
fuel filter tomorrow and will carry on from there if there is a need. From
what I can see under the hood there are two holes to mount fuel pump relays
on the fuse panel, but there is no sign of a relay. Either the pump is on
all the time or the relay is located elsewhere. I assume that the fuel pump
relay holes are for a different model and are unnecessary. It would
certainly help to have a service manual. 
The surging I am experiencing seems to have little rhyme or reason. It
occurs at 4000rpm or cruising at 2500.
I'm curious to know where the limiter switch is located and perhaps if I can
find a service manual I can quit boring everyone with my endless questions.

Sound like the tires you have on your front are out of balance or
out of round.  You can check for out of round by jacking the front
wheels up so that the tires are about one quarter inch above 
your garage floor and rotating the wheel at about 20 rpm. If your 
tires/wheels are round, you will see no variance in the gap (it should
stay at 1/4 inch)...

944s are notorious for shaking with the slightest imperfection in the 
wheel/tire balance/roundness/trueness combinations.
Good Luck!

Opps, I need some advice...

While driving, I broke the engine mounting bracket to my 81 911SC
this morning while crossing railroad tracks.  It is the steel
mounting bracket in front of the fan housing, with 2 bolts that
attach to the engine block, and 4 or so that attach to the larger
steel bracket that extends left to right across the front of the
engine compartment. (front being the part closest to you with the
engine lid open).  Am I screwed?

The engine dropped about 1.5 inches in the rear, and the fan pulley
rubs against the bracket that broke now.  My question: Do I 
need to pull the engine to put a new steel bracket in????  Also,
what is this bracket called?

Looks like its about time to put the $100 Chevette winter-beater
back on the road a little early, and buy that floor jack I've
been meaning to get.

Unless you really mash the throttle this seems very low.  I get 17-19
around town and 24-26 on the highway.  No one has ever accused me of
be conservative behind the wheel, so I assume you could do even better
than these numbers if you used the cruise and overdrive going down
the highway.  Interestingly enough, I always get better gas mileage
out of my wifes 325i when I drive it than when she drives it, and 
I generally drive it in much the same manner as I drive my 951...

Subject: Brakes

   I noticed the other day that someone recommended not painting brake 
calipers because of heat dissipation concerns.  I'm interested in finding 
out if this is something to worry about.  I'm not interested in fashionably
changing the color of my calipers but since I'm going to rebuild them soon,
I thought about painting (high-temp paint, of course) them to protect them 
against the corrisive effects of brake dust. 
   When I inspected the brakes, I noticed quite a bit of surface corrision
on the calipers. I'll eventually change to a lower-dust pad but we just 
bought this car and it has almost new pads now, and with all that needs to
be replaced, practically new pads are low on the list.
   If anyone has tried this or has an opinion to offer, please let me know.
Bear in mind that this is a 924 so we are not dealing with state of the art
braking hardware, but anything that will make any part last longer is always
something I'm willing to try.

Well, you said "carbs" so there are two answers here:

1) full race to SCCA rules spec, etc. Use conduit in a size something like
   1/2", and cut 1/2NPT threads on the outside. Buy some 1/2NPT to AN-8
   female fittings, then make up hoses out of AQP to mate with the similar
   fittings that should already be on the fuel cell. You'll have to find
   similar fittings that fit into the carb body -- SCCA requires that
   the carb fittings be threaded rather than press-in. The one big variable
   is the fuel pump, but electric pumps for racing purposes are routinely
   available in AN or 1/2NPT threaded fittings. You'll also need a fuel
   pressure regulator, adjustble.

2) street (less than full race). I still vote for the above solution, but
   you *DO* have other options. You can get 1/2NPT to 1/2 ID rubber hose 
   (the "barbed" fittings for press-on hose) which you can use in conjuction
   with good grade of 1/2" ID rubber fuel line and hose clamps. This is
   also what you do if you're keeping the stock EFI, but the fitting
   sizes are different -- that 9mm Wurth line you need to use requires
   a 3/8" barbed fitting.

The *HARDEST* part is if you try to use the stock fuel pump. Give it up.
It doesn't work right for the application and it's really hard to get the
right hose setup to work... the Bosch pump really REALLY wants press-on
rubber hose, and that's not part of the program with the fuel cells. Plus
if you try to use AQP as press-on hose, you discover that there is NO WAY
to get enough compression on it from a hose clamp to keep it from popping
off when that's what you least need...

Subject: Re: New paint job


Steve,

ask them about *everything*.  It could mean the difference between being 
satisfied and being totally bummed about a poor job.  For eg. ask the 
following:

* are they going to remove all the windows?
* are they goind to replace all the seals?
* are they going to paint inside the door jambs?
* are they going to re-paint the matt black border on the *inside* of the 
doors?
* are they going to disassemble the car. i.e. remove the doors, hood, 
decklid.
* are they going to paint the back of the decklid and under the hood?
* who's going to re-assemble the car?  These cars are *not* forgiving for 
guys who have'nt taken them apart and put them back together before.
* are they going to remove and re-paint the black trim and emblems?  If
so, what materials or paint will they use?  How well will this paint stand 
being out in the sun without oxidizing or flaking off?
* are they going to re-use the old fasteners when re-assembling the car?  
This is a complete waste if for example they intended to put your corroded 
old allen bolt back in your side mirrors.  New paint with old fasteners = 
does'nt look good...
* if your car is silver, ask them if they're any good at shooting silver.  
It is a bitch to get it right.  Many times even experienced painters will 
have silver coming out blotchy.
* what brand of paint are they going to use?  (I can't recommend any except 
Glasurit cause I've had two cars done in it - its good)
* how far down are they going to strip your original paint?  There's no 
need to go to bare metal if the factory paint is good (especially since 
your body panels are galvanized - you don't want to remove the galvanizing)
* BEWARE if your car is a targa and you're going to have the top seal that 
goes on the windshield frame replaced!  The factory replacement seal DOES 
NOT FIT without some modification.  The new part appears to be made for the 
later Carreras, which is fine because it seals the wing windows against 
water better but they seem to be a different shape (thicker) at the 
windshield corners than the original seal, and will require manual trimming 
of seal to make it work on an SC.  Make sure the guy who replaces this seal 
is an old hand at making the new factory part fit on your car!  This is 
time consuming to do and the seal fairly expensive too at around $160.


Hope this helps, and good luck!

P.S.  If you decide not to paint your car, you can buy my SC.  I've done

Ouch! Don't use a wash mitt. Use a horse-hair brush (_very soft, long
bristles_) and apply it lightly on a very wet car with a swirling action. 
Eastwood sells such brushes. The idea is (as long as everything's wet
enough) that the ends of the bristles "lift" the grime off the car.

Yep, that crush ring is in there between the knob and the lever - you just
have to press real hard.

The sleeve is suppose to hold the knob on take the sleeve out and put at the
bottom of the knob.Bottom is def as the opening so when you push the knob on
the shaft the sleeve will grip and slide toward the top of the knob and if
not worn out will hold the knob in place.

I live in Los Angeles and buy Sierra phosphate free antifreeze at Pep Boys for

 Prices are probably highest at dealers and small auto repair shops (or

Subject: 914 End play

Here's a straight forward but, it seems, uncommon question. Can you use more 
than three shims on the end of a 914 crank? In my attempts to check end-play 
this weekend, I discovered that the Scat crank has a total end-play of 55 
thou. and needs to be shimmed (theoretically with three shims) to between 3 
and 5 thou. Shims come in thicknesses ranging from 10 thou to 15 thou. As 
you can see, this presents a problem, mathematically,[ (3 x 15) + 4 = 49] 
Anybody have any experience with this?
TIA

Subject: The Weekend from Hell

Last Thursday night my wife and I left Cedar Rapids, Iowa to travel
to the Minneapolis area to look for a place to live.  Btw, could you
Twin Citians please contact me so I can ask some questions about 
places to live and such.  Anyhow, we took the Porsche since her
BMW was still up on jackstands waiting for new rotors to arrive
in the mail.  That afternoon I filled up with gas and shortly 
afterwords had some hesitation in acceleration.  After pulling 
over and looking things over, I decided I must have gotten some bad
gas and that it would have to work its way through.  

During the trip the car lost power two different times.  Each time
I would loose power the car would loose rpms and I would pull over.
It never died.  After a minute or two everything would return to 
normal and we'd be on our way.  We had reserved a motel room in
Albert Lea since we couldn't find anything vacant in the Twin Cities
area over the weekend.  When we were about 10 miles south of Albert
Lea I lost power again.  This time the car died and wouldn't restart.
When I turn it on it would idle fine for a second or so.  Then it 
would idle roughly at 400-800 rpm and die.  I tried this about 10 times
with the same results.  

When it was clear that my car wasn't going to start we walked to the nearest
town.  Luckily we were only a half mile out.  The small town (I don't know
it's name) was shut down for the night.  Even the convience store was
close at 10:15, but luckily it had a pay phone.  We called the local 
dispatcher and a sheriff stopped by.  He seemed somewhat knowledgable
about cars and looked at it with me.  We gave it another 10 tries or so
with identical results.  He called a local towing company that offered
flatbed trailoring.  The sheriff gave us a lift to our motel room and
we called it a night.

The next morning I stopped by the local Ford/VW/Mazda dealership and 
asked if they would look at it.  After I described the problem, they 
told me that they had seen a lot of problems with gas lately and that
the cars would restart after cooling down.  Figuring it wouldn't hurt
to try, I start the car up and it idled fine.  I paid the towing bill
and drove out of the lot.  I got it just down the street when the
problems started again.  This time I kept it going but it was running
very roughly and wouldn't get above 2000 rpm.  I got it on a frontage
road and back to the dealership.  We still suspected gas problems, so 
they called around town look for a fuel filter.  No filters compatible
with a 944 Turbo could be found in Albert Lea, MN. 

I was at a loss at this point.  My worst nightmare had come true - my
Porsche was broken down in the middle of nowhere.  I didn't know where
to have it hauled in the Twin Cities area - this seemed like the only 
option at this point.  Of course, I hadn't bothered to bring my CRAP
list along.  This was only a five hour trip, nothing serious would 
happen in that time - yeah, right!  I had luck on my side again.  One
of the salespeaople at the Ford dealership had an '83 944 and they 
refered me to Carousel Porsche.  I called the towing company again and
had them flatbed it to Carousel.

We rented a car at a different dealership in Albert Lea (the Ford 
dealership was out of rentals) and drove to Bloomington to meet the
realitor.  The car got to Carousel at about noon on Friday and they
started looking at it at 2:00 or so.  I called and talked to the 
service manager that afternoon and he told me they had determined
that it was nothing simple and that it would be Monday at the soonest.
He said that he could make no promises about that.

We finished our business in Minneapolis Saturday afternoon.  We tried to 
find a one-way rental to get us home, since the rental we had needed to 
be returned to Albert Lea.  We check with all of the major rental companies
and none of them had anything available in the Twin Cities area for the
weekend!  I called one of my friends in Iowa City and had him meet us in
Albert Lea and give us a lift home.

Last night (Monday) I called to find out the status of my car.  The service
manager said it needs a new air box.  I guess in the end it had nothing
to do with bad gas.  The really depressing news is that supposedly there
are no air boxes in the US and they will have to order one from Germany.
Does anyone know what he means by air box?  Is this the air flow sensor?
I plan to talk to the actual mechanic (he was gone last night when I called)
later today to figure out what's going on.

I'll keep you posted on what developes.  This is only the second time since
I've owned the car that anyone except me has touched the car so I'm a bit
apprehensive at this point.  Thanks for listening.

Subject: '91 911 C-2 Mistery wire

     Two questions:
     
     1.   Mystery wire
     
     I have found a loose wire in my 1991 911 C-2, behind the diagnostics 
     plug, not connected to anything.  The diagnostics plug is in the 
     passenger footwell -- on the right side, and is about 3" in diameter.
     The wire can be seen "behind" the plug, once the cover is removed.
     
     The wire is really two wires, connected together into a push on 
     connector.  Both wires are brown, with some color stripes.  The wires 
     are always hot (12 VDC).
     
     The dealer told me that that this is used to power up the diagnostics 
     meter/analyzer.  But that does not compute.  If Porsche needed to 
     deliver 12VDC to the diagnostics tool, it would come out of a pin in 
     the main diagnostics plug.
     
     2.   Second question -- the user manual states that after hot run, the 
     engine electric cooling fan will come on, if the engine is overly hot, 
     after shutting down the engine.  Even in the last hot spell in CA, the 
     fan did not come one.  Does anyone have a C-2/4 which has a fan which 
     does come-on after a hot run on a hot day?
     I just went through the fan resistor recall, and they replaced the 
     resistor in the hot air duct.  I believe that this is the same fan.
     
     Does anyone have a clue on either questions?

Well, it depends: do you want it to work and continue working for a long

Experience with oddly made parts and quality control problems from SCAT?
You bet. Enough to have involved the CA AG office a time or two, and to have
ceased doing all business with them.

Experience with needing more shim than I have allowance for? Yup, that too.
Means that something is WAY out of spec. Could be the flywheel, could be
the crank.

BTW, I *THINK* that FAT has a special extra-thick shim in their catalog.
That's not where I am at the moment, so I can't check. But you might call
and ask anyway.

Ross and other P-files,

As you all may know, I'm considering buying a 85.5 944 located in 
Mountain View, CA and driving it back to New York City.

When I read Ross's story it scared the cr*p out of me. I'm 19, looking

My worst nightmare is it breaking down in nowheresville without a 
competent mechanic to work on it. Remember this is my first Porsche, so I 
sure as heck wouldn't know what to do!

Am I crazy, should I have it trucked (if I end up buying it). That should 
run $800-$1000 right?

Have any Porschephiles successfully driven a car from the left coast back 
to the East? If so, let me know what it cost: gas, motel, tolls, etc, etc..

As always this list has been most helpful,

Starting out smooth (even if somewhat slow) allows you to take the time

not always the other way around...

The 944 is, um, er, "transitionally challenged".  You must anticipate all 
turns, but especially those in a slalom.

> c) I take my curves way to tight, thus my tires have to work extra hard.  
> I need to increase the radius when I turn.  

Be careful here.  It's a very popular thing to drive larger arcs (a la 
roadracing) in autocross events.  Keep in mind however that physics 
dictate that you will be slower _through the turn_ when you increase the 
size of the arc.  The benefit is that you have a higher exit speed for 
the next straight.  This works great in road racing, but in autocrosses, 
there usually is not enough straight after a turn to matter.  I'd 
encourage you to drive the largest radius you can that has you finishing 
on the inside edge of the turn (late apexing) but (almost) never add 
distance just for the sake of increasing exit speed in an autocross.

> of the gates.  Also, I had lot of problems with a seemingly easy curve

As someone put it eloquently, planning your run (via numerous walk thrus)

"reacting".

Don't be afraid to use the full designed range of engine operation 
allowed by Porsche!  OTOH, don't ride the rev limiter for more than a 
second either.  At that point, you'd have been faster (and somewhat 
easier on the car) to shift to the next gear.

I like to run near empty, but Mike Piera said it best in his post on the 
same topic yesterday: Start out near empty and run that way until you 
know what it feels like.  Then try running full and see which YOU like 
better.  

Enjoyed a PCA autocross this weekend.  Took FTD.  It's fun to (flame bait 
alert) explain to all those 911s that they may be slow if they're low on 
antifreeze.  ;-)

    It would be cool... but my personal opinion is it would be much
easier to build a 400-450HP naturally aspirated engine if ballistic
performance is desired...  then you wouldn't have to figure out intake
ducting and such, much less space, and you get the cool sound of a lumpy
cam as well...  My feeling is, if he wants to go fast, let him!
    I must point out, though, in a car that light, you really don't
*need* a lot of power to go fast... I think 400HP would be quite
sufficient to make me happy!  "Limited income" might be a problem though
(ask me, I know!)

    I just got an idea the other day that came dangerously close to
making me aroused...  check this out and see if you find any flaws with
this reasoning.

    Take one fiberglass 550 Spyder replica.  Reinforce chassis.  Install
full 911 suspension and big brakes.  Add 3.6 Turbo motor.  Tune if
desired.  Make some flares and add big wheels and tires.  Go really
fast.  Smile a lot.

    Other than the fact that a 550 would definitely require some sorts
of aerodynamic add-ons (some kind of chin spoiler, rear underbody air
channels, plus some side intakes to keep the motor cool...) can anyone
see why this couldn't be done?  Would a 914 be a better platform to
start from, even though it might be heavier?
    The recent trend toward really ridiculously fast road cars (Bugatti,
McLaren, etc.) has gotten me wondering if the intelligent enthusiast
couldn't come up with something equally fast (if not as refined) for a
lot less $ and a little ingenuity.

    Anyone want to fund this project?  Think CMU would give me a
research grant for it?  (yeah right...)

later,

So...I went and bought a new heater valve.  Of course, when I went to put 
it in, I realized the problem was not the valve, but that the valve was 
receiving no vacuum.

For the temp fix, I've disconnected the controlling arm, and moved the 
valve into the full closed (a/c) position.  Any problems with this?

I drove the car around town, and with the a/c working, the car was fine

Being smooth is not nearly as important on an autox course as it is on a
big track. Considering you have so little time to learn (i.e. so few runs)
the correct line, it is imperative to be aggressive and to find your cars
limits on the course. Obviously it is important to find the right line, but
you cannot afford the time to go slow while doing it.

Physics dictates that you will be slower through the turn when you increase
the size of the arc ONLY if you maintain the same speed. Just because you
are on an autox course does not change the fact that the fastest way through
a turn is not the shortest way. 99% of the time a corner in an autocross
should be late apexed. Rarely do you have a straight that is long enough
to justify an early apex at the corner at the end of the straight.

Increased exit speed is EXACTLY what you are looking for. The key is finding
the line that allows a decent entrance speed and allows a fast exit speed.

I like to run with a half a tank of gas. Why? My car was setup (suspension
settings and corner balanced) with that much fuel and it feels right.
I do not know what the issues are with 944's, but the 911 can use the
weight over the front wheels. Especially those that understeer in any case.

Menelaos Karamichalis <mnk@wuerl.wustl.edu> asked :

>>a) I noticed that a lot of cars were bumping their rev limiters.  The end 
of the auto-x track had a straight run where everyone just floored it on 
second gear.  I am very hesitant to hit the red line.  Should I be?  Or is 
the rev limiter something I should use from time to time?  I feel that my 
fear to mash the pedal on the floor costs me time. <<

Yes, this fear is costing you time. You should have your pedal floored
whenever possible (with a few exceptions when going slower can help).

Don't worry about using the rev limiter, that's why it's there. It is usually
faster to "ride the limiter" for a second than to upshift and then downshift
for the next corner. But if the "straight run" was at the end of the course
with no later downshift needed, then you SHOULD upshift if you can hold
the higher gear for a second or so to get a higher finishing speed.

>>b) How much fuel should I have in the tank?  Should I have little fuel so 
the car can be light or does the extra weight aid in rear whell traction? <<

I answered this for 911's yesterday. For a 944 the answer is similar.
VERY powerful RWD cars (Vettes and Camaros) can go faster with full
tanks because they can put the power down better with weight over
their light rear ends. But a 944 (with better weight distribution and 
less power) with a good limited slip (you really need one for
serious autocrossing) should not need a full tank, as the tradeoff in 
weight will offset any small traction gains.

Of course you need enough gas so as not to starve in long corners.

Of course all loose items must be removed, but anything the factory

in SCCA Stock classes).

In the Connecticut Valley region of PCA, the spare tire must be
installed in the front of a 911/914 for track events. They believe it 
helps to absorb impact in a crash. SCCA also allows the spare in 
autocrossing.

But my '72 911S full-size spare has no tie down that I can find. Does

     I am soliciting advice!
     
     I just got my 2.2E motor for 914/6 running.  I did this on a stand 
     outside of the car to observe things more easily, like leaks!
     
     I have two small "weeping" type oil leaks.  The first one is at the 
     lower oil cooler mounting (about 1 drop/10 minutes). This one doesn't 
     bother me as I can remove cooler with minimal work.  
     
     The second leak has me concerned.  It is on the bottom of the cases, 
     at the seam, just forward of the flywheel end.  I have pretty much 
     ruled out the rear main seal, as there is no oil on the vertical of 
     the cases below it.  I have pretty much ruled out the strainer plate 
     too as I have wiped the area dry several times and it seems to be 
     "weeping" at the last 2-3" of the case seam.  In about 10-15 minutes 
     of running I get 1-2 drips. Problem doesn't get any worse when running 
     and actually drips slighty more after shutoff and engine hot.  When 
     cold it almost stops!
     
     After spending about $3500 and two months, I am not in the state of 
     mind to completely disassemble the engine to diagnose/fix.  I am 
     seriously considering degreasing the case split area to the rear of 
     the strainer and applying a good epoxy... And crossing my fingers.
     
     Other than the leak, the engine runs great, oil pressure is fine and 
     steady, even the carbs were synced!
     
     BTW, when assembling engine cases I must have checked those oil 
     passage seals for positioning about 10 times.

I installed the Craig autoreverse pullout unit into both of mine ($98 with

Hi Wayne,
If you look along the inner rim of the gauge, you will see some fine
lines, like tick marks, along the edge.  I think there are 3 or 4, but the
critical one is about 1/2 way up the left side.  That is the 'you'd better

the heater valve on 944 is up agianst fire wall and controls

it is vacuum operated.  a small vacuum hose is connected to

I suggest applying a vacuum from known source to the valve

and feel fo heated air coming out of ducts.

most likely its the valve not closing. it could also be vacuum suply

How much do you know about the 944?  Any maintenance you plan to do
immediately after purchase (timing belts, tune up, etc.) I would have
done before leaving CA.  What happened to me this last weekend certainly
isn't going to stop me from taking long trips in my Porsche.  What's the
point of having it if I can't take it out and enjoy it?  I've put over
20k miles on it before this happened.  This is the first time it has 
even hesitated to start or run.  For $1k you can have a lot of towing 
and repairs done to your car and think of all the fun you will have
missed.  My major concern is time.  I couldn't stay until it was fixed.
If you're a college student (I assume from you address) and you have
some free time this summer be sure to budget extra time in case anything 
happens.

The only thing I would do different is I would take the CRAP list (very
stupid move on my part) and a copy of Excellence and Pano.  They both 
have advertisements from companies throughout the US.  Even if those
companies can't directly help you, they can point you in the right
direction for the region of the country that they are in.

>Have any Porschephiles successfully driven a car from the left coast back 
>to the East? If so, let me know what it cost: gas, motel, tolls, etc, etc..

This all depends on how you go and how you drive.  Are you going to
make any unnecessary stops along the way (ie. tourism to stops)?
The more you decide to do besides drive, the longer it will take
you and the more money it will cost you.  Figure you can stay for
$30-40 a night at decent low priced motels such as Super 8, etc.
You can cover 500-600 miles on a decent day.  You should be able to 
make 25 mpg on the highway fairly easily.  You'll also spend $15-20
a day on fast food/pizza/etc type places.

I haven't driven from one coast to the other since I live in the middle,
but I have driven several long trips in my Porsche.  If you do decide to 
do the cross-country tour let me know.  I'd be interested to know how it
goes.

I have had this special "Porsche only" limited use insurance
for a few years because it is very inexpensive and I don't
drive my car on the street often.

But this year they have changed the "carrier" from The Great 
American Insurance Group to American Modern
Home Insurance Group in Ohio. I am on the extremely
limited CLASSIC plan (<2500 miles per year, must be garaged, 
can't be left parked in public parking for shopping trips, can't be
driven to work, etc etc).

The cost was $177 per year for an agreed value of $17,500.
Now it will be $291 per year, with the only benefit an increase
in mileage to 3,000 miles (big deal - I put about 250 miles on 
my car in each of the last 3 years).

Did anyone else see this huge increase? I am thinking of adding
the 911 to my normal GEICO policy, but don't want them to
get worried about me driving a "performance car" so I'll probably
just pay the extra and keep this insurance.

Anyone else find a good classic insurance that will insure

Haven't got my renewal yet. But been with them since the beginning and if
the rates almost double then I can go back to nationwide and then the
daughter can drive the 914 as well. She is starting to show an interest in
autox and touring etc. This is amazing I we built a 914 toghether while she
was in high school when it was done she wouldn't drive it. I guess we made
it too good.

Anyway will let everyone know when the renewal comes in.

Subject:      Best P.car Insurance

I haven't really followed the insurance thread of old and late, mostly
because I'm on USAA(my Dad was in the military and works for them still,
me & my Mom still get the benifits) and they seem to have the best rates.
Anyway, my question is for my roommate, the one who wants to buy a 944/24/
28.  He doesn't know where to start looking for insurance quotes and he
can't do one of the special Porsche insurances because he doesn't own a
house, garage, etc. that they require.  So, can anyone give a top three
list of the cheapest/good service insurance companies?  The only prejudice
that I have is against GEICO, for they distribute radar guns to police
stations that can't afford them, allowing them(GEICO) to raise premiums
on their customers who get trapped by these guns.  But, if people have
found GEICO to be fair and cheap, I guess I will pass the info on to my
roommate and let him decide for himself...  Thanks for any help!

Very well put and very true...when taken in the context of a beginner, 
however, teach line first.  Speed will take care of itself.  If the

aggressiveness, but when dealing with the testasterone set...

I disagree.  Here's the physics.  Speed^2 / radius = GForce.  If I'm on a
100 foot radius going 40 mph I'm pulling 1.07 G.  Let's say you are
running parallel to me on a 200 foot radius (to use simple numbers). 
You'll need to go twice as fast as me to complete the same arc in the same
amount of time.  The only problem with that is that to do so you'll need
to pull 2.14 G's!  If I have my car at the limit, you can't keep up on a
larger arc unless you somehow are capable of pulling higher G's as your
speed increases--you didn't mention that your 911 carries a wing the size
of a 747, so I'm guessing you can't pull 2+ G's.  ;-)

Scott's opinion is the popular one, mine is the minority.  But Sir Isaac 
doesn't care whether you agree with him or not, he's still going to apply 
the law to you equally.  And G's being equal, you'll never be faster IN THE 
TURN by traveling a larger arc.

> Increased exit speed is EXACTLY what you are looking for. 

True in roadracing, usually not in autocross.  Now comes the tricky part. 
How do you balance exit speed, which DOES go up when you run the bigger
arc, against corner time which is better with a smaller arc.  On a typical
autocross with say 150 feet of acceleration after a turn before you have
to lift (and brake) for the next one, how much faster would you have to be
at exit to overcome the time lost on the bigger arc?  If you're
interested, Scott, I'd be glad to do the math.  Only problem is, it'll
probably bore the heck out of the rest of the list, AND it might convince
you to drive my line!  And the last thing I want to do is give you the
tools you need to beat me when we meet on the autocross course! ;-)

Well, I've done the cross country trip in my 914 and in my 944.  The
first trip was in the 914.  We left the Monterey Parade and drove to
PA. for a 50th anniversery, then drove home after that.  No a/c, in a
black 914.  I do the driving, and my wife navigates.  Long days, but
not that bad.  We had a problem with bad fuel, but got answers/help
from a shop that Tweeks told us to call (we were outside Indy.) and
some other problems from driving a 18 year old car cross country, but
nothing that stopped us.

The next year, we picked up the 944 for the Boston Parade, and drove
to Boston by way of visiting FL. and then drove home by way of Mt.
Rushmore.  Over 10,000 miles that trip.  The only problem we had was a
sticking idle stabilizer - which we drove through Denver and had
checked out at the dealer (it was fine to drive home, just might not
idle well sometimes).  Otherwise, it was a fantastic trip!  

Like Ross said, do the belts and oil and any other work done before
you leave CA.  Then, take the CRAP list, the Pano (March issue, I
think) and Excellence, and any numbers you might need.  Plan on stops
just to move your legs around (I've seen 600+ mile range on my 944).
The 944 is a great car for long trips.  

For keeping costs down, we usually camp.  A tent, sleeping bag and a
small cooler do the job.  This keeps the costs down.  For gas, if you
keep to "normal" days, about a tank a day is reasonable.  For speeds,
after getting East of NV., I keep the speeds down so I don't have to
budget a lot for tickets.  And for food, remeber you won't eat as much
because a) you get less activity while driving, and b) you will love
driving your Porsche so much you won't want to stop.

Like Ross said, take the extra time and make the trip!

        That's it.  The sleeve is just a ribbed piece of sheetmetal
that's bent around into a cylinder shape.  You can probably pull it
out of the knob with a paperclip or some such.  Then wrap it around
the top of the lever, maybe sticking partway off, and push the knob
down onto it.  Twisting may also help.  I had no problem with mine.

Thought I'd add my 2 cents to the good advice already given on this thread.

Sometimes, depending on the car and engine torque-curve, it is beneficial
to shift rather than run on or near the redline. I always thought my former
914-4 2L went faster when I short-shifted from second (maybe 500-1000 rpm
early) to third if the length of the straight would give me two or more
seconds of running time in third. I thought the engine pumped out more
torque (and speed) running at lower rpms in third than at redline in
second.

Plus, it gives you lots of opportunities to practice your heel-and-toe
downshifting/trail-braking manoeuver.

I have no idea about 944 engine characteristics at an autocross, however.

I was just thinking along those lines last night as I was reading
the Autoweek article on the 550.  The 550A was about 1200 lbs,
150hp and did 150mph!  A 3.6 turbo might be way scary.  A 3.2
would be less expensive and less scary. ;-)  You would need to
figure out if any front and rear spoilers are needed to keep the
car on the ground.  I thought about how often I would be able to
drive such a car up here in Oregon and decided a hard top would
need to be developed so I could drive it in the rain (or not get
my head ripped off above 150mph).  The suspension and chassis would
need to be strengthened because we would want to use race rubber
and big brakes. :-)

Sounds like fun!

Scott Winders   <winders@apple.com>

A lot of good points were made.  These included:
a) I may be faster to shift up if there is time rather than bump the rev 
limiter.  Given that the power/torque curves go down past a certain 
engine speed, it may be advantageous to go up a gear and may actually finish 
faster.
b) Taking a curve wide is not necessarily better than finding the "line" 
which takes you through the curve with the highest exit speed.  In my 
original post, the curve I was revering to was an approximately constant 
radius curve (slightly straight in the middle), so there is probably a 
better line than to simply take the curve wide.

Nobody mentioned a case of fuel starvation for the 944.  I know from 
talking to other autocrossers last weekend that some cars to starve for 
fuel when running with less than half full a tank and if you have a turbo in 
such a car it _really_ hurts.  So it is a matter to play with for the 944 
as its balance is not affected that greatly by variations in fuel weight.
 
Thank you very much gentlemen!  I will try to apply these next time I am 
out in the course.

                        A Field Guide to Cars
                          and their Drivers

When you're driving, you know that there are some cars you just don't want
to be behind. Here is a list of them, ranked from least to most offensive.

Ferraris being driven by anyone over the age of 80.
These drivers have always wanted a Ferrari and now that they are going to
die soon, they've got one. Unfortunately, the spirit is willing but the
flesh is weak. They don't have the leg strength to push in the clutch,
so must drive around in 1st. Fortunately, this still amounts to 60 MPH.

Corvettes driven by middle-aged men.
Something of a mystery. Why buy a sports car, even if it's only a 'vette,
if you won't exceed the speed limit?

Volvos.
Volvo drivers are not actively obnoxious, but it's real hard to get something
with a power-to-weight ratio approaching 0 to move.

Dodge Omnis with large, turbocharged engines.
These drivers don't quite see how 'weight transfer' and 'front wheel drive'
are related. When the light changes they briskly apply all 500 HP, burning
the rubber off the front tires within 15 feet, thereby blocking the
intersection.

Plymouth Reliants.
These are only driven by people with a mental age exceeding 70. They know
that somewhere in the Bible it says 'Thou Shalt Not Exceed 40 MPH.'
Most annoyingly, they also remember something about 'Be Thy Brother's Keeper'
and so will do anything possible to keep you from passing them. Fortunately,
this isn't much, unless you are driving a Volvo.

Subarus.
Subarus are owned only by radical eco-freaks who are convinced that the
gas pedal is a plot hatched by the oil companies and the military-industrial
complex and thus refuse to use it. Many go so far as to have it removed.
Knowing that truth and justice is on their side, they feel no guilt in
taking 5 minutes to accelerate to 30 MPH and will scream obscenities
and make rude gestures when passed.

Similarly, there are some cars you definitely want to stay behind.

Toyota pickups.
These are owned by only by yuppie cowboys who don't realize that no
real cowboy would own a Jap truck. Secretly embarrassed by all of their
friends that can afford BMWs, they try to drive like they owned a
Bimmer, too. You can usually find these vehicles firmly attached to telephone
poles.

Japanese 'sports cars'.
These silly people actually believe the advertising that they see on TV,
and think that the Japanese have a long history of fine sports car development.
These people also think that since their car is so wonderful, they must be
too. You will frequently see these cars applied as thin films to the
rear of Toyota pickups, or caught in the grilles of semis.

Porsches.
Well, you sure as hell won't be able to get in front of them.

Subject: 944 Tensioning Gauge Instructions

Greetings All,

Would some kind soul(s) share the secrets of using the tensioning tool?  My
budget allowed me to purchase the gauge but I'm going to have to wait a bit
before I get the manuals.  

Seems to me that you pull the pin out to allow the slider to drop, insert the
calibration bar, snap the slider back in place and adjust the dial indicator
 (via the outer ring) to read *zero*.   Pull the pin, remove the calibrator,
and you're ready for business.

1) Does the tell-tale needle on the indicator serve any special purpose?

2) Is this the setting that you then tension both belts to? in other words,
tension the belts until the gauge reads zero? 

3) For the cam belt, does the roller contact the *smooth* or *toothed* side
of the belt? 

4) For both belts is there any *wrong* location to place the gauge? or is any
location with enough room to accomodate the gauge acceptable?

TIA for all responses

BTW, if anyone is interested in renting this gauge please email me.

To cars you don't want to be behind, I'd add:

Anyone whose head doesn't show above the seat back.

Anyone wearing a straw hat.

Any car full of heads of large, gray hair.

Any older car, particularly a large, older car, retrofitted with a
third brake light.

Any car with a license frame that reads "Happiness is Being a
Grandparent."

Any camper, particularly with the bumper sticker "We're Spending Our
Children's Inheritance."

As for cars I don't want to be behind me, there are times when I'd
like to have a bumper sticker reading, "Watch Out--I Drive Like You Do."

This seems to work for me:

 - Thoroughly hose down the car first, preferably using a garden spray
  gun at it's highest pressure (do not use high pressure washer!) This
  is critical to remove as much dirt as possible without touching the paint.
 
 - Make sure the soap water is really sudsy. Wash the car from top to bottom,
 ie. windshield, roof, hood, fenders, lower body. If necessary, use a different
 sponge/mitt for the cleaner top part than for the lower body. Wipe in straight
 lines (not swirls) in the direction from front to rear (or vice versa).
This way
 any scratches inevitably created will be harder to see. May sure the sponge/
 mitt is always loaded full of water.
 
 - When drying the car (with cotton towels/diapers), I tend to blot rather than
  wipe.
 
For removing swirl marks and fine scratches, I use Meguiar's #9 Swirl Remover.
For waxing, I use Meguiar's #26 Yellow paste wax. I'd recommend using the
#9 once and #26 thereafter.

Byron, you are making an assumption in your calculations that just is not
true. You are assuming we are traveling in constant radius to get around
that corner. If that is how you are driving the corners (in a constant
radius) then you are not the faster car!! I try to spend as little time
as possible turning the car. A late apex is the best way to do this and
maintain momentum.

Obviously you must hit the apex of the turn fairly closely or you are
wasting valuable space and time.

My opinion is not only the popular one, it is the fastest one as well. I
have proven it to my self on the autox course and all the truly fast
autocrossers I know do this as well. I really can't stand it when people
misapply physics to a problem and do not take into account the variables.

Like I said before, we are not going around the corner in a constant radius
arc. So please tell me how you are going to to do the math. Plus, you have
no way to calculate entrance and exit speeds or the varying g forces
applied.
There is no way for you to calculate this without full telemetry and many
runs to gather data. I have empirical data (faster times) to back up my
claims.

Please, by all means come out to the Bay Area so we can see these "minority"
techniques. It would really be fun to see how you do compared to us folks
in the incorrect majority. Like I said before, I have not seen a 944 (any
version) in the top ten since I started autocrossing. I really would like to
see it happen!!

come on when I hard brake only not with a light touch as it used to be.
This is concerning since I like to warn drivers behind me that I am lightly

Subject: Problem with 5th Gear

Folks,

I am having what I think is a problem with 5th gear on my '85 911.
Whenever I try to go to 5th, the stick seems to get stuck on the
way into 5th. Then if I push harder, it seems to "click" past
something and then smoothly completes going into 5th. I don't have
a problem with any of the other gears. It seems to happen at any speed.
It gets stuck just past neutral, then the rest of the throw is OK.

Could this be a clutch problem? A transmission problem?

Any ideas would be appreciated?

Thanks,
Darryl
'85 911 Turbo-Look

Darryl,
Your shifter has a lockout device that prevents you from reaching reverse
once 4 th gear has been selected. To reach 5th gear you go through this
device on the right side of the pivot point and it moves out of the way. If
the lever is too far to the right it stops the shift lever from coming
anyfurther back. This device is spring loaded and somethiong may have
happened to it or your shifter may just need to be reset. I would pull the
console and rubber boot off and have a look at the locout system befor
getting too radical with anything else.

Completely wrong:

The correct sequence:

1) using the calibration gage, adjust the tension tool so that the gage's 
tension reads 4.0 plus/minus
0.0 and with no tension, the too reads 0.0 plus/minus 0.0.  For the sake of this
demonstration, assume that your new (undropped, undamaged) tool is 
in calibration...

2) Hand crank the engine forward to TDC (#1 Cylinder). Now, reverse the 
engine about 1 and a
half teeth of the camshaft sprocket. This will put all of the tension on the 
lower side of the timing
and the balance shaft belts.


3) With the tool scale dial now set to zero, pull the pin and attempt to 
place the gauge on 
the cam belt. The roller should be on the toothed side of the belt.  Push 
the moving 
arm up and lock it in place. Rotate the tell-tail so that it is at rest 
against the dial
pointer.  Pull the pin, releasing the tension on the dial pointer.  The 
reading is now
preserved by the tell tail.

The proper location is on the side of the crankshaft that has no tension.

They shouldn't actually be "salvaged" since it is really tough to "total"

best of luck.  Sounds like a great opportunity.

"High pressure" is a relative term -- coin-op washers probably can't hurt
your car's body (from a pressure standpoint), but the kind you might use to
clean a sidewalk or take serious grime of an old engine can definitely mess
up your bodywork and tear the skin off your body. Regardless, they're not
really suited for cleaning cars - they don't deliver enough water, and the
pressure will not dislodge a lot of things that might adhere to your paint.
You can spray at mud thrown up by the rear wheels all day and it won't go
away, but a quick stroke with a brush will probably dislodge all of it.

The bottom line is you needs lots and lots of water with a sudsing agent,
and it needn't (shouldn't?) be steaming hot.  This avalanche of water,
coupled with a very light mechanical means of cleaning the surface (e.g.
the horsehair brush) is a safe and effective means of getting the dirt and
grime off your car.   For tough stains (e.g.  road tar) I use Goo-Gone with
great success.

This happens to my 530i every once in a while (twice so far).  The fix was
super-easy -- pinch the return hose to watch the pressure go sky high (just
a second or so), then let go ... after that, everything returns to normal. 
 I think the regulator gets slightly "cocked" (i.e. not sealed) internally
and the valve inside doesn't seat correctly.  Raising it off its seat (via
the pinching) and letting it return solves it every time.

Scott, you continues to miss the point.  Smaller arcs are absolutely,
positively 100% faster than larger arcs 100% of the time when traversing a
set angle, such as 180 degrees.  Or for clarity, consider a full 360
degrees.  You can go around a smaller circle in less time than it takes to
go around a larger one.  (This is a re-statement of my original thought
that you found so objectional.) That's NOT to say that smaller arcs are
always, 100% of the time, absolutely the fastest way to get around the
entire autocross course.  Absolutes like that don't work.  I concede that
late apexes are faster in some situations, but IMHO they are generally 
overused in autocrosses.

As a matter of fact, we (my teammates--my wife Yvonne, and Steve Compton)
studied very closely a couple of Bay Area 914 drivers who were the best in
the Nation at the time.  We were constantly amazed at their line choices,
and only numerous reviews of the tape convinced our brains of what our
eyes saw.  We began adopting their lines and I'll be darned if it didn't
work.  That year the Bay Area drivers (a husband a wife team who lurk here
often) both won National Championships, and just for good measure his
sister won as well.  The next year, using the techniques we'd learned from
these Bay area drivers, my wife took second at the Nats, while Steve and I
each won our first National Championships.  In my class I was campaigning
an 80 hp 914 1.7 against cars with as much as 140 hp, and I won with the
5th biggest winning margin in SCCA history for a class of this size.  Some
of my competitor's noticed my bizarre line in one particular turn and
tried to figure out why I was going so fast.  A stop watch showed that I
was over 1/2 second faster in that ONE TURN.  I led on that course by only
about .3 seconds, so without that edge, I would not have led that day
(though I still would have won--I had a great first day...)

Currently I'm spending entirely too much time screwing around with a
program which takes my downloaded information from my G.Analyst and turns
it into course maps.  Along the way I'm doing more Trig than anybody
should ever have to, and I'm studying what works and what doesn't work
behind the wheel.  I'm thrilled that you're happy with your driving style. 
I'm not happy with mine, and I'm continually pushing myself to learn
better ways.  My work behind the wheel and in the office makes me fairly
confident of what I'm saying, but hey, that's not to say it's 100% correct
100% of the time!

Well, I'd be glad to oblige you...

In the interest of keeping the conversation light, let me just say I'd be
glad to meet you halfway (I'm in Colorado)--how about the Wendover UT Pro
Solo later in July?  If your car fits the stock category in SCCA you're
supposed to be just slightly faster than me.  Forget that, I'll run you
even up.  If you're beyond stock class, no worries, we'll apply the
published NCF factors after properly classing your car.  I'm easy!  And of
course, in the interest of fairness, I should be willing to pay for your
trip, once you've enlightened me of course.  So how about this...loser
pays the winner's costs.  You just let me know what you'd like included,
gas, hotel, entry fee.  I'm open.  Just let me know. 

Are we on?

Before we all assume that this is syncro trouble shouldn't somebody
recomend checking the clutch adjustment for propper release?
I don't own a 924, but to 914/911 owners those symtoms usualy mean
the clutch cable is streching/breaking. I don't know 924's, but it
might be worth looking into.

Subject: 73 911 alt/elec problem

Still having trouble with my alternator??? My light is dim ALL the time.
The light does not glow bright when ignition turned on- - -nor does it go
out when car is started. It just sits there and dimmly shines. As the bat
starts loosing it's juice, the light seems to grow brighter!! The other
evening I was out on my nightly beat-in cruise, as I turned back onto the
highway I turned on my lights and the engine died!! I turned them off and
it came back to life. I think this was caused by the low battery, right?

I,ve cleaned all the ground connections(5),cables, and fuse holders. I
keep blowing the #1 in the 2nd box and can't figure out why. I'm don't
like electrics anyway. Also, when my headlights are on, they always stay
on "bright".    

I don't know if I've just got a bad alt, or the whole wiring is screwed
up. Any help??? I'm getting tired of pulling the battery out to charge it
every time I drive the car!!  I carry 2 batteries(one for reserve), and
change them as necessary. I'd like to get as many miles as I can before I
pull the alternator out to check it. I've got too much other work to do on
the car to let it sit!
If anyone can help me with this , it will really be appreciated.

                                           Thanks,

     Some more about insurance.  
     
     Some time back, upon reading in the Digest about insurance, I noted 
     the one message from M.Willis, about the Leland-West insurance.
     
     At that time I was in the market for a ~91 911 C-2 Targa.  After 
     purchasing the car, I contacted my old insurance - Nationwide - with 
     which I had my 912E insured with (for ~ $340 per year).  
     
     I obtained a quote from Nationwide - about $850/year - which is about 
     $300 above the Leland-West quote ($580). Naturally with Leland I am 
     limited to 2500 miles per year, $1000 deductible, but that is about 
     all I plan to drive.
     
     
     If anyone finds a better deal, pass the info along.

Subject: Experience with Short Shifter kits in 911 ?


Hi all,
first thanks to everyone who answered my question about fitting
the earlier exhaust on my '77 911. As I didn't have the correct
oil line in hand, I modified the existing one (some cutting and brazing)
as a temporary fix. No oil leaks so far! I will replace this fix with 
the original part in the near future.

Now I'm considering to install a short shifter kit in the same car.

The only one that I know of is the Weltmeister kit listed in the
Automotion catalog. In the catalog it says 'This is the only kit that
comes ready to install without welding or epoxying!'.

Has anyone on the list any experience of installing this
kit? Is it as easy as it seems?

Are there any other kits on the market that might be better?

How come you can build a kit car, shove in a scary engine, probably

You should see a small hole at the top of the tool. I believe that a 1.5 mm

The correct tension setting for a new timing belt is 4.0 plus/minus 0.3.
For a previously used timing belt 2.7 plus/minus 0.3.
For a balance shaft belt 2.7 plus/minus 0.3.

Amen.  The car is great on the highway, and a blast when

It's easy to tell the car was designed and built by

Be very careful with a used 944.  There is a very wide
range of cars out there from "cherry" to "ragged out."
The suggestion to always have a Porsche checked out by
a Porsche mechanic is a VERY good one.  I didn't and
probably paid $1,000 more than I should have.

I bought the best 87 944 I could find (in south Florida)
two years ago.  The car was owned by three different
German engineers with Siemens (they sold it to each other
when they each left the US).  The paint is flawless and it has all
maintenance records.  The clutch had been replaced at 20K mi.
It had one known problem:  the front seals were leaking.  It turned 
out that the water pump, oil cooler seals, and the front seals were 
all having problems, and the repair bills were alot more than you 
might expect due to the amount of labor these replacements involve.
The maintenance costs can be very high unless you do the work yourself, 
and that can take some time - 944's aren't the most easily serviced 
cars.

That said, I applaud anyone's decision to purchase a 944.
They are GREAT cars.  And being on Porschephiles means you're
ahead already.  The cars aren't that expensive to maintain
if you do your own work.

Read the 944 FAQ (at ftp.tta.com, or through the WWW page).
Good luck with the car.

Boy you are a braver man than I, I look at the cash invested in that engine and

On the short shift stuff, there have been a couple of articles in Panorama

short shift kit, complete with new housing and all....really good stuff. THe

Not trying to be too much of an advert for the folks from Stuttgart, but I

Subject: 944 ball joint: observed!

I'm in the process of swapping out the suspension, replacing it with the
bilstein turbo cup (group A) set up. I've now started on the struts. the
new shock is not an insert, and has a shaft which is 40 mm in diameter.
Meanwhile, at the bottom, the control arm is attached to a 30 mm (tubular,
man) Andial sway bar. What is connecting all this up you ask? There is a
ball joint buried in the control arm, which has a shaft going into the hub
carrier. It can't be more than about 1/2 " in diameter. >YUK!<

I am amazed that with all the development in the 944 series, what looks
like the original rabbit part is still there. Are these the same folks who
changed the door skins with every model designation change?

Are any of the "updated" control arms using a larger diameter ball
joint/shaft? Do I HAVE to change them out for driving schools (mostly the
glen)? I don't see any obvious damage (I'm working on the right side).
Would secondary creep be observable from the surface?

What about weight? Are the steel arms a LOT heavier than the Aluminum ones?
The front end is now carrying 255/40-17 tires on HRE rims, AND 12.75"
coleman rotors with the red (C2-turbo/RSR) calipers. I'd like to keep the
unsprung weight to a minimum.

     Bart, in Texas a water-damaged car (totaled by the insurance company)
 will print "Water Damaged" on the title. It may be the only stain you
 can't remove from the car. We've had a bunch of water damaged cars, they
 are the best totals you'll ever get.

      Luckily when it floods, it floods water and not some noxious chemical...
 If the car was running or hot when or it ingested water, you may have a
 real problem. If the car stalled out and then water rose above it (usually
 what happens) or just sat while they got wet I wouldn't blink twice about the
 car.

      Virtually every flood-damaged car returns to the road. You'll spend
  forever cleaning it and spraying WD-40 in the electricals, but gauge your
  repair expenses by what obvious cosmetic problems you have and add a change
  of all fluids. Make sure the motor turns (even if it won't start).

      Also, a buyer of a '95 Porsche expects a new car. You'll have to
  seriously discount the sale. Don't even imagine not telling the buyer
  as you'll get sued and end up giving the car away for free (anybody buying
  a car for $50k has money and friends for lawyers...).

Paul,

I don't know if this will help but I recently had a similar problem with my
'68 911L. My alt light was always on just ever so dim. The alt light would
only get brighter as the load on the alt was greater ie. fan, lights,
wipers. I had my motor and trans out of the car this winter so everything
was disconnected and then reconnected.

I'll do my best to explain how my problem was fixed in layman terms (the
only terms that I know....) there are a group of wirs that come from the
alt. There should be one big one that goes directly to the ground, there
should be another group of wires thgat go to a plug which plugs to the
regulator. The last wire, a red with white stripe, goes to a "block" under
the coil and screws in. On this block there are two spots where wires can be
screwed in. In my situation the wire was bolted to the wrong screw on the
block and has worked ever since.....

I don't know if this made any sense or not it just that I was so happy to
have the problem corrected without the expense of a rebuilt alt that I
thought I would forward this info on......

 I used a factory short shift kit on a 73.5 we had for a bit. Instalation
was not a big deal. I did read somewhere about the actual reduction in
throw with all the kits available. If I remember correctly the OEM kit
was the best to use with the most reduction in throw (not to mention being
correct!). I also recall taking part of the assembly to a machine shop for
pressing. The job took about 3 hrs and the owner is more than satisfied with
the work. Oh yea... I do remember having to get a couple of shims to make the
shifter center properly. My recomemdation is to go with the OEM where available.

I have installed the weltmeister kit in my 912. It was a straight forward

It seems to work well as I have had no problems with it since the install. 
The one thing I don't like about it is that it is a bit shorter in height

Fellow Porschphiles:

It is with great sadness that I must announce that I am in the market to sell 
my 944 Turbo S. This is the most wonderful car I've ever owned but higher 
priorities dictate its sale to the next happy owner.  The plus side to this 
story is that there will be another Porschephile joining my family very soon! 
Unfortunately, I can't get two child seats safely into the car at one time.  

So if any of you are interested, here are the specifications of the car:

 - 1988 944 Turbo S; 70,352 miles:

 - black (newly touched up and waxed) exterior, immaculate light grey leather 
interior.

 - 247HP engine with a recent full service at 60K and the belts at 42K.

 - Limited slip differential, M030 suspension with 928 brakes, hardened clutch 
and transmission.

 - Special 8" and 9" alloy wheels with practically new VR rated Goodyears 
attached.

 - All accesories are power operated with central locking and an alarm 
w/remote.

 - Porsche CD-1 tuner with a Blaupunkt equalizer amplifier.

I can mail, fax, e-mail or ftp the original window sticker, service records 
and pictures if you're very interested.  I'm asking $13,950 for the car.  This 
is down from a much higher original asking price.

While your example is correct it's irrelevant.

When you increase the arc, it's not going from a circular arc a one 
radius to a circular arc at another radius.  It's generally going 
from a geometric apex to a late apex.

There are two main reasons for a late apex:  exit speed and correct 
line.

You will be fastest through the turn with a geometric apex.  I'm sure 
Scott knows this.  However, the point is not to be fastest through the
turn.  The point is to be fastest around the course.  To be fastest 
around the course *rarely* calls for a geometric apex.

Also, G's are not equal.  With a 911 they are a function of 
acceleration.

For example, 911's will sustain more lateral G when one is on the 
throttle than when one is not on the throttle.  Thus, a 911 driver
has to choose a line that allows him (or her) to stay on the throttle
during the turn, particularly during the exit.  This generally dictates
a late apex.

By the way, if your opinion is the minority *and* your are not fastest 
in class, that's natures way of telling you something...

Also true in at least one place on most autocross courses.

How do you balance the incorrect line you achieve during linked turns
if you drive a geometric apex?

You balance it turn-by-turn, course-by-course, car-by-car, and driver-
by-driver!  See the 911 specifics above if this is unclear.

You can't do the math; it's specific to the course driven and that's 
*never* circular sections, constant speed, and constant sustainable G.

From: BLenoble@aol.com
Subject: Racing / AutoX lines

Hello All,

This is getting very interesting! Will Scott accept "The Challenge?" Will
Byran  teach us trigonometry (please no)? Who will win the Porschephiles Cup?
Will King Richard explain his technique? Stay tuned for further episodes of
"As the Wheels Turn."

Seriously, I think people are missing the point here. Everyone has valid
data, but in racing and autocrossing it is impossible to speak in absolutes.
Too much depends on the course, the day, the car, and the driver to say what
is faster ALL of the time.

All of the books I have read on competition driving (the red book, something
like "Secrets of Solo Driving" by Hank Watts, "High Performance Porsche
Driving" by Vic Elford, Bob B's book, and some other books on racing) say the
same things. You will have a higher exit speed if you drive the proper line
through a turn. They ALL also say that this may not be what you want. One
book talks about "Throw away" turns. These are turns that usually occur right
before another turn that exits onto a long straight. The "Throw Away" turn is
usually not driven in the classic "proper" line if the exit from that line
would leave you out of position to enter the next turn. 

An example of this is turn four at Lime Rock. This is the start of the Esses.
There is a quick left turn followed immediatly by a right turn that leads
onto No Name straight (the back straight). The traditional line for the left
turn (if taken only by itself) would be to stay wide before the turn, turn in
to the apex, and then track out to the right edge of the track. While this
would make you fast through the left turn, it would leave you in the
completely wrong position for the next turn, a 90 degree right onto No Name
straight. Since you will be spending much more of your time on the straight
than in the turns, having the higher speed getting onto the straight will let
you have the benefit of this higher speed for the entire length of the
straight. The REAL line for the left turn is to track in towards the apex,
and then hold the car on the left side of the track and NOT let the car drift
to the right edge. This has you in the perfect position to enter the right
turn, and go quickly down the straight.

Watt's book also describes the different lines taken due to car differences.
He uses a big block Corvette vs. a 911S as a good example. The nose heavy,
high powered, understeering Corvette needs to drive a much different line
than the lighter, less powered, oversteering 911. The Corvette is going to
have to use trail brake to get the car to turn in. The 911 has to keep the
momentum up in order to overcome the HP advantage of the Corvette.

What was my point again? Oh yeah, I remember now. Since autocross courses
appear and disappear so quicky, it is very difficult to argue over a computer
screen about the proper line. I would say that if the turn leads onto a long
straight, then late apex, etc. If the turn leads immediatly into another turn
(as MANY turns in an autox do) you are probably better off staying towards
the inside of the turn, and minimizing your time in the turn.

I'll be autocrossing july 22 and 23 with the Metro NY PCA. I'll try some
different lines, and let everyone know how it turns out.

This doesn't equate to what I know about slip angles!!

the slip angle is a vector and if you are on the throttle, the slip angle 
is the vector of the cornering force and the acceleration

as the slip angle determines the max amount of acceleration you can 
apply, you will drift wide as you apply power and/or tend to spin the 
wheels - talking about spinning wheels, I have never been a great 
believer in brains and maths helping you get round a course quickly, its

Subject: Overheating 912 problems

Now that the temperature is hitting 90 degrees here in Oregon my 912 is starting 
to complain.  If the temperature is above 80 I can only drive for about 25 
minutes before my temperature gauge is horizontal and I notice a loss of power. 
 (I will eventually install a oil temp gauge).  I think I know why the car is 
overheating but I do not know how to fix it.  I have a 1966 912 with an air vent 
that comes off the air blower on the right rear side of the engine and splits 
into two vents approximately 3 inches in diameter.  One of the vents goes 
straight down into the rear engine shield above the exhaust pipe coming out of 
cylinder # 2.  The other vent is suppose to have a heater hose connect to it and 
the heater hose should connect to a matching hole in the rear engine shield 
right above the exhaust pipe coming out of cylinder  #4.  Right now I do not 
have the heater hose connected.  Now here's my problem.  The two holes in my 
rear engine shield for connecting the heater hose to are centered right over the 
exhaust pipes from cylinders #2 and #4.  I have no way to connect the two holes 
in the rear engine shield to the flapper boxes because the exhaust pipes are in 
the way.  I believe my engine is a European one  (the engine serial number 
starts with 8), but the heating system is U.S.  I would think that the 
additional additional air would help cool the cylinders but I can't see how to 
hook it up.  Do I have the incorrect rear engine shield?  All my other engine 
shields are in place except for the small one that goes under the fuel pump. 
(I'm painting it)  Is this missing heater hose my problem or could it be 
something else?  Either way I want to have heat by this fall so I need to get 
this figured out.  As usual TIA!

I'm not sure that the backwards cap theory works, as I often wear mine that
way. (Perhaps I should check my own driving habits?) Yeah, better stay away
from me, as I chop to that apex and power my 911 out of the corner.

My observation is that it's best to stay away from BMW convertibles, VW

I can't help you with a 901 (what is a 901?). For my car (944, G50?) it was a

EZ BLeed is a one-way valve. You still need someone to pump the brakes. My
experience with one-way valves is that they take some time to bleed the brake
system. Eezibleed is a pressure bleeder that uses air from the tire or an air
tank so you don't need an assistant. Eezibleed is great when you want to
change out the brake fluid because hte job  takes about 10 minutes. I
advertise Eezibleed in Pano so look for my ad. I have several articles about
Eezibleed from the Star, Roundel, Performance Reports, etc. and if you
contact me I'll be glad to send you a copy. There is confusion over the name.
Eezibleed is made by Gunson Ltd. in the U.K. EZ Bleed is made in the US by
Waekon (I think that's the speliing) Industires.

On cars I'm familar with:  The switch is on a plate attached to the pedal
cluster.  The brake pedal pushes on a rod, the rod hits the master cylinder
plunger.  On the rod is a disk, which holds the switch off when the pedal is
not pressed.  The switch is mounted with two screws, and can be twisted
slightly to adjust.

While you're doing this, you aren't too far away from the gas pedal.  You
might want to check out all the connections in there to make sure that
everything is proper.

        Oh, man!  I was honestly trying to stay out of this!

>Do you want increased exit speed? Always. Anywhere, including an autocross.

        I think I'd like to disagree.  In a 914 in particular, there are
occasions when you simply want to drive the shortest path through a corner.
I have been told this about several particular corners by some very exper-
ienced 914 pilots--including at least one national champion.  ("Dave, get
off of that 911 line!  You need to be over on the inside--it's shorter!")
        It does not happen all that often (here I disagree with Byron), but
it does happen (here I disagree with Scott and Larry).  The low power/high
stability nature of the 914 probably has something to do with why that was
the appropriate 914 line.
        Also, note that Byron has an evenly-balanced car, while Scott has
a tail-heavy car.  What is right for the one is not *necessarily* what is
right for the other.  Further, Byron mentions that the straights on the
courses he drives on are typically 250 feet.  Most of the events here in
Zone 7 (where Scott drives) tend to have longer straights.  I managed to go
about 60-65 MPH at the end of one of 'em--and a stock 914 does *NOT* do
that in 250 feet!
        I think one of the reasons for the disagreement are that Byron and
Scott are talking about different cars, different courses, and different
driving styles.  I'd *love* to see both out on the same course!  If I could
get within ten minutes of their times, I'd be doing well.    8)

Hi,

A couple of questions regarding late 70s - early 80s 911 specs (as taken

For the '78 to '83 SCs, horsepower seems to range from a low of 180
to a high of 204 (for the '81). Can someone explain where the differences
come from? eg. is it easy to upgrade a '78 SC to '81 specs? Is there
anything (other than HP) to chose from between the SCs (eg. are any more

And, for the '84 to '87 Carreras, the specs show different HP specs

Subject: 914 engine problems - HELP!!!

OK, here goes again. A while back I asked this question, but 
unfortunately, although good, the answers I got were not the answers I 
needed.

I have a 1972 914-4 1.7 L.  I have slightly modified the engine with a 
new mild cam, new lifters and new heavier valve springs, all from Weber. 
 I did the rebuild myself, following all specs to the 'T'.  When I turn 
the engine over without the rocker assemblies on the heads, it spins 
like it should by hand and with the starter.  When I put the assemblies 
back on, it gets very tight, almost too tight to turn by hand.  A brand 
new Bosch starter and fresh battery only turns it past 2 cyclinders and 
stops.  I am not binding the rocker springs, the valves aren't touching 
the pistons, and the timing is right on.  I even went as far as pulling 
the engine back out of the car and taking the heads back off.  I put the 
old lifters and old rocker springs back on, still tight.  Weber says the 
Cam was designed to work with the stock valve train.

The engine ran ok when I started all this.  The car is now completed, 
waiting for a beating heart!  I am so frustrated with this problem, as 
are others who have seen what I've done, that If I don't get it resolved 
soon I'm going to break down and either sell the car or buy a new engine 
(depending on what kind of mood I'm in!)  Please help, as this is my 
last resort. (Or, does anyone have a nice-used, turn-key 1.7L for sale?)

Subject: Exit Speed


What Larry Wilson failed to tell everyone is that his exit speed is 
usually calculated from the sideways position, that is , he usually is 
driving by seeing the road ahead through the passenger window. It makes 
course and coner workers scatter when he exits.

We have it on film.

Byron, that was a good, simple explaination of how magazines arrive
at the cornering force during testing. Peter Albrecht does this on a
regular basis, perhaps he could explain a little of the process used
for slalom and lane change info. His stuff is *very* accurate.

BTW, if you want to do this test for yourself, find the levelest site
possible with a GOOD surface, asphalt only. Be sure to run BOTH 
directions on the circle. I usually use a chalker and a 100 foot cord
as a concentric tether to set the circle up. The trick is to be as 
steady on throttle as possible when running. I use a timer to ensure 
that the reading is accurate by converting elapsed time to speed then 
cornering force. Works great, doesn't lie.

Roger Kraus and I did this with my 914/6 in 1979 and discovered that 
we had broken 1G on street (P6) tires. This was one of the first 
recorded instances of that feat. We later learned that Goodyear had
done the same with a 1978 Corvette with some very radical changes.
My car was being set up for the SCCA A/S class.

Traversing a set angle of 180 degrees is not very hard considering it is a
straight line. Or did you mean a 180 degree turn?

What kind of autox courses are we talking about here? I don't see many
that have a bunch of constant radius turns greater than 90 degrees. In
fact, most turns on autocross courses I have driven on are full of 90
degree turns. Most of these turns are best taken using a late apex. It is
obvious that not all 90 degree turns can be taken with a late apex due
to the fact that you have to set yourself up to be in the right place
when exiting the turn. The "right place" will vary depending on what follows.
If it is a  straight, the "right place" is arrived at via an early apex.

When I late apex a turn, I spend very little time in an arc and a whole
bunch of time in a straight line accelerating. Draw a 90 degree corner
on a piece of paper and draw an early apex line and a late apex line.
Which line has the longer arc? Which line spends more time in a straight
line? Which line has more time on the the throttle?

Faster than myself, that's whom. I have tried late and early apexing many
times and have found that 95% of the time, the late apex is much faster. I
am not saying I am faster or slower than anyone else. That is not relavent

No, I am not happy with my current skill level. I am constantly trying
new things and taking instruction from the fastest drivers (914 and 911)
that I can find. These "people" include Henry Watts, Tom Provasi, and Galen
Bieker. I let these people drive my car so I can see what they do with it.
This is where I learn the most.

It is quite possible that the 911 is so different than a 914 or 944 that
we are both right. Hell, maybe the 914 and the 944 need completely different
lines all the time or part of the time. I am certainly coming from a 911
perspective on this.

This doesn't equate to what I know about slip angles!!

the slip angle is a vector and if you are on the throttle, the slip angle 
is the vector of the cornering force and the acceleration

as the slip angle determines the max amount of acceleration you can 
apply, you will drift wide as you apply power and/or tend to spin the 
wheels - talking about spinning wheels, I have never been a great 
believer in brains and maths helping you get round a course quickly, its 
always the ballsiest drivers who win.

********************

I respond:

Actually, the slip angle is an angle, not a vector.  Angles are not 
vectors.  Ever.  Period.

The slip angle is the difference between the orientation of the 
car and its heading, e.g. slip angle is zero when car is moving 
the same direction it's pointing (going straight); it's 90 
degrees when you aren't moving and get 't-boned.'

Typically, one achieves maximum tire adhesion at a particular slip
angle (generally around 8-10 degrees) for a given normal force.

Tire adhesion may be approximated by the product of the "coefficient" 
of friction and the normal force on the tire.  The problem is that the 
"coefficient" is really a function (yes Virginia, they lied to you in 
freshman physics).

The "coefficient" of friction is determined by a number of factors 
including tire temp, slip angle, inflation, road surface, tire 
loading, and so on.

Since the adhesion is the product of the "coefficient" of friction
and normal force, increasing normal force generally increases the 
adhesion of a given tire; the friction circle increases in diameter.

When you are accelerating, the car experiences a weight shift from 
front axle to rear axle.  In other words if you are on the throttle, 
the normal force on the rear tires increases and the adhesion of the
rear tires increase at the expense of front tire adhesion.

If a car tends to oversteer (can you say 911?), you generally want to 
transfer weight to the rear wheels during the exit of a turn.

As far as brains getting you around a course, let's just say that if 
you don't understand what the car is doing and why, you generally 
wind up sacrificing chickens (or spare 'vette drivers) to the tire 
gods when you make changes in your setup.

Stupid ballsy drivers go sideways nicely, but they aren't very fast.

I'm not sure about Porsches, but when I used to work in Vegas (late 80s),

Subject: Re: Rev Limiters, fuel and autocross

Lot's of interesting and thoughtful feedback on this thread.  Here's my 
favorite snippets:

Larry Wilson asks (I paraphrase here and elsewhere for brevity) if Isaac
Newton applies his laws to all equally, what kind of a deal did he strike
with King Richard (Petty) that allows him to run those NASCAR races on the
high line, passing folks like crazy?  Simple.  The bank increases in slope
as you approach the top.  This allows you to pull more G's.  (Technically,
the car is still pulling the same amount, but the banking imparts an
opposite g force which counteracts a portion of the g's produced by the
car, but let's not get too technical.) Anyway, if the banking at the top
is sufficiently steeper enough (what sentence structure!) to compensate
for the required increase in speed, the car could be faster in the top
groove. 

Barry Lenobe summarizes the place of exit speed very nicely.  Remember my 
original post?  It didn't deal with exit speed or fastest times for the 
full run, but rather emphasized that you will always be faster on a 
tighter arc for the duration of the turn only.  This was emphasized with 
_underlines_ once and with UPPER CASE a second time.  Still, most seem to 
go right by that point--Barry didn't.  Barry understands the trade off 
between corner time and exit speed.  Barry and I could still disagree on 
a particular corner or two, but at least we'd be considering the same 
factors.

Pete Diffey disagrees that 911's pull more g's when on the throttle.  
(I'm trying to remember who said that was true in the first place.)  
Well, Pete, put me on record with whoever it is that you're disputing.  
Everything I've ever raced shows higher g-analyst readings when you're on 
the throttle--trick is staying at that proper slip angle for long enough 
to be useful without going too far, exceedint the tire's limits, and 
slowing down.  This is even more remarkable when you consider that a 
G-Analyst will show falsely low lateral readings and falsely high 
accelerative readings as slipangle goes up.  But I digress...

Of course, Thom Fitzgerald puts it all in perspective when he says "my 
car doesn't even compile!...Get yer butt out there and drive, dammit!"  
Well put!  (Although I do think that math has a place in examining ways 
to go faster, but hey, I'm more geeky than the average software 
developer, I guess.)

And Scott Winders takes an easy kill-shot here...

> Traversing a set angle of 180 degrees is not very hard considering it is a

ZAP!  No disputing that one.  BTW, I bet we take about the same line on 
180 degree angles...

Well I differ a bit, but conceptually, we're trying to do the same thing
in MANY corners.  There are times to early apex, though not as many as
there are to late apex.  Still, a nuetral apex (what I like to call the
asymmetrical line) will produce a faster time _through the corner_.  (Uh
oh, I'm doing it again.) The decision that must be reached is will that
time savings exceed the time lost down the next straight?  In autocross,
it's my opinion that the answer is YES more times than most drivers think.

I hope you don't mind, but I've just added one teensy word to your 
statement to make it more palatable to those with different experiences.

Actually, in our example we were trying to prove one line over another.  
In this case we can set the speed to anything we want.  The trig is used 
to plot various points along the ever changing arc.  It's real easy when 
you do it on paper.  It's tougher when you do it on the course, then you 
need some instrumentation...

> All the G-Analyst is going to give you is g-force. What does that tell you?

A run of G-Analyst data can be used to compute speed.  This speed is then 
used to calculate the radius of the arc at any instant via the G-Analyst 
lateral readings.  This arc can then be plotted using a little trig.  
Along the way, it's neato to devise a correction factor for slip angle.  
More trig.  But hey, we're boring the masses.

The dotted line represents a crown, you start down a slope as soon as
crossing it.  Although the slope isn't steep, the crown is abrupt and a
great number of cars lift the fronts slightly as they cross it.  The turn
is followed by one of the longest straights on the course, probably 250'. 
BTW, the venue was 1993 Solo 2 Nationals South Course.  If you find that
map, it's the corner in the opposite corner of the course from the start
line.  Through 4 days of walking the course, I NEVER saw ANYONE ELSE walk
my line.  And everyone looked at me like I was nuts when I walked mine. 
And, I have to admit, that while I think many didn't run the best line for
their cars, the extreme line I drove was probably only advisable because
of the car I was driving. 

Show me your line, I but it's the popular one.  Then I'll show you mine, 
and why it works even though I had to have given up some exit speed.  Be 
prepared for some (horrors!) math.

That sounds great!  More course has been very California-light this 
year.  But if next year is more normal, I'll be in your neck of the woods 
at least once.  Let's try to get together!  And seriously, if you would 
be interested in trying a really fun event, come on out to the Wendover 
Pro Solo!  It's really a lot of fun.  Minimum 12 runs over 2 days; if you 
do well you can get up to 10 more runs in the Challenge, wherein they 
name an overall champ.  Or maybe next year the Parade will fit my 
schedule better and we could meet there!

I have made it a policy to stay out of these things but this time I cannot

you go fast.  It might help you understand why you are slower than others.
 What will make you fast is to watch what the fast guys do and do that.  What
will make you fast is practice, train and drill and practice (seat time) and
more practice and experience.

Autocrossing and track events are not an intellectual activity.  It is a

          People have been recommending a Zerex product which I
          admittedly know nothing about, but I was wondering if it's
          ethylene glycol (EG) or propylene glycol (PG) based?

          There's a PG-based brand (who's name escapes me) that has
          been advertised as environmentally friendly because it isn't
          as toxic as EG.  It also has no phosphates, but
          it's heat transfer and lubricating properties are different
          than EG.  I think the Big Three have warned against the use
          of PG-based antifreeze in cars not designed for it.

          Just my $0.02.

>From what I have seen there are two general classes of fast drivers. Some of
them are very intuitive. They try things until they find something which
works, and then they keep doing it. They in general don't know why their
particular technique works in a given situation, they just know it works.
In some cases they can't even describe quantitatively what they do. For 
instance, you ask them if they turn in to corner X before or after the
doohickey on the track surface, and they don't know. They just somehow
turn in at the optimum point for that corner, every time.

Other fast drivers approach the problem more analytically. They tend to
try to think through what ought to work before they start experimenting,
and they tend to be interested in understanding why a given technique works
so well after they have found the best choice by experiment. The latter type
of driver is frequently just as fast in the end as the former. Surprisingly
enough, this forum seems to have many technically oriented people in it
which approach problems the latter way. I therefore disagree with wou that
all of this discussion is worthless. If the combatants were both "armchair
racers" who had no significant actual experience, I would agree with your
comment. However, both of the primary contributors seem to be successful
autocrossers who in fact have "gotten their butts out and driven", and
I, for one, find the discussions interesting as an ex-road racer who
only very occasionally autocrosses, but who likes to understand why a
particular technique works or doesn't.

Before I say what my line would be (I often change them based on what
happens my first time around a turn), what kind of dimensions do we have
here and how much speed am I carrying into the turn (how long is the
straight before it)?

How much much run out room do I have on the exit (how wide id the track
there)? If I have a lot, I take an earlier apex (still a late one though).

Also, you say you were about .5 seconds faster through the turn than
other people. How much did they make up on that straight? Did you time
the difference? This is an important piece of information!!

However, with the data I have now, I would probably try something like this:

           o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o

This line would require significant breaking (at point number one) to
slow down the car and to get it rotated then floor the sucker. There
appears to be plenty of runout on the turn so I could drift the car to
the edge of the track  under full acceleration from point 1 and carry
good speed down the  straight. This is an example of a turn heading
onto a long straight that you can start with a late apex and end with
early apex and still  carry speed down the straight.

You have picked a very good turn to prove your point. It is not common
to have a decreasing radius turn with so much room to the outside.

Before I am crucified, please provide the requested data.....

"BAD DREAM.  Brad Windle of Salt Lake City was so nervous about denting the
mint-condition black Porsche he just purchased that he refused to take it
cruising Friday and parked it in front of a friend's house.  Big mistake.

Around 2 a.m. while the group drank cocktails on the friend's deck, the heard
a loud crash.  A sailboat had drifted down the street on its trailer and
docked against the Porsche, smashing the car.

Salt Lake City police are in search of the missing sailor."

Our only troubles so far (Oct-June 95) and 4000 miles & 3 days at Lime Rock
was the air compressor & water in the passenger side front and rear footwells
under the rubberised sound-proofing. The air compressor wiring pulled out of
the cigarette lighter adapter plug on first use - dealer replaced
immediately. After several hours of searching for the source of water
intrusion at the dealership, they found that the factory had burnt thru a
hole at one of the spot welds in the rear of the passenger side wheel well
behind all the plastic enclosure stuff. Seems that at speed in the rain the
water gets thrown up and around and weeped in. If it hadn't been that the
wife was cleaning the car out from the crap accumulated at the 3 days of Lime
Rock and a piece of the rubber underlayment was turned up under the carpet we
probably never would have found it. (Pays to have a PCA national concours
judge for a wife sometimes.) The water did not smell especially fresh.
Recollection was that we drove in rain some during our use of car in Germany
when we took delivery in October, again on way back from Charleston when I
picked it up from shipment in early December as well as 2 of the 3 days at
Limerock in April. Problem was fixed by insertion of silicon sealant in hole.
Covered under warranty. Definitely going to keep record of that for future
and periodically check under mats after out in rain. Suggest everyone do this
periodically cause you won't get a clue thru the carpet cause the rubberized
coating on the soundproofing is a solid barrier to moisture escaping from
between the sheet metal and it.

that clearly was very low to the ground, jazzed up with pinstripes, etc.   I
was curious, thinking this was an F-150 Lightning, a pretty speedy truck, so
I pulled alongside.  The pilot had a full shock of white hair,  looked about
70, and seated beside was the frau, another head of white, hands primly

>From your description, you have a VERY BAD MISMATCH! You apparently have a
European Fan Shroud (with open air outlet hole for the Euro heaters), but you
have the  American  style "Flapper Boxes"! The air bleed off the fan shroud
is really needed to cool the 5' of exhaust pipe inside each  Euro heater box.
The Euro heater is always "on", with  a deflector valve on the body under
ther car either sending hot air to you inside or to the  atmosphere outside,
depending on what position your heater control is in. 
    In your case, having the flapper boxes,  what  you should do is BLOCK OFF
the air bleed hole on the right hand side of the fan shroud. Cut a piece of
sheet metal to fit, and use the existing bolt holes/weld nuts to attach. If
 you really need something to block this off, let me know at (408) 727-1864,
as I have a few of them around the  Shop. A Better Solution (at least a more
visually appealing solution) would be either to replace the  Euro fan shroud
 with an American one, or convert the engine  to the Euro heater boxes. If
your  engine number is 830,000 to 836,xxx it was Originally a Euro model.
Unfortunately, to convert to Euro you need some expensive parts- like the
heater boxes, muffler, muffler supports, etc. I have them in stock in case
you want to  go that way. If you want more info, give me a call at (408)

Subject: Hot 911SC

I have a 1980 911SC that has been running hot the last two times I have driven 
it.  The first time it happened, I was close to home and noticed that the temp 
gauge was between the top of normal and the bottom of hot.  In the past, the 
gauge has never read past the top of the normal range, except for very hot days
or during a track event.  Even then, it only went slightly past the line.  I 
pulled over and shut the car off and looked for anything that could be wrong. 
The engine runs perfectly and does not make any unusual noises.  When I started
it back up to continue home, the temp began to come back down towards the 
normal.

Today, on my way to work, the temp climbed again.  It never went past the 
halfway point on the gauge, but still made me nervous, since it was fairly cool
out this morning (60's).

Any clues as to what this might be?  Could it be a faulty sender?  Is there 
some kind of thermostat that could be sticking?  Also, how hot do other SC's 
tend to run?

Any help is appreciated.

don't know what your ride is, but the bmw club runs schools at virtually
every major track in the country, and they don't require you to drive a
bmw, the way pca requires a porsche. The prices are lower, as they aren't
in it for the money, and they get subsidized by the national club. I've
been going for 10 years, (both here and at mosport via bmwccc) and while
I'm not fast, I'm smooth, and never bent anything but the ol' ego.

I once got a ride with an instructor at the glen. Going into the turn at
the end of the back straight (before the chicane was installed), this guy
dives for the inside, and hangs there all the way around this major
sweeper. We'd been sweating the late apex, exit speeds, setting up for the
turn, balancing the car, you get the idea. This guy had a simple answer, "
if the inside was left open, someone else would try to pass me there".
THAT, boys and girls, is the difference between the driving line they teach
us (or try to), and the racing line, where it only matters that you come in
first.

I take umbrage at the broad inclusion of SUBARUs as cars to stay away from.
My SVX (daily driver) is a truly civilized car for a relatively small price.
Its 3.3 ltr horizontally opposed flat six (water cooled) has a distinct
design resemblance to the 911, and sounds like recent vintage 911s  when
pushed. (The fact that it's water cooled and rumor says that the next new
911 will need to be watercooled ... maybe Porsche will imitate Subaru!
Seriously, though, one wonders why, when Porsche, Ferrari, and yes even
Subaru can squeeze so much out of such an engine that others don't follow?)
And, sure it's heavier than your SCs, RSs, my 944, and even a C4;  but it
will easily keep up on any interstate around. The SVX is only "good" through
corners, can't hold a candle to my 944 but  I wish Porsche could do a
climate control system like my SVX.

Hello, I'm an Italian with this intention: I'm trying to organize a list of

2200 pieces.
There is something egual for the model 911 RS of 1972 (in a grat big book),
but nothing for the 3.6 Liters.
So, from every part of the world, please write an e-mail to this address:
lucat@galactica.it  
and in the subject write:
CARRERA C2-RS
If someone will be interested in the list, contact me and every 100 models
I'll send him.

In Your reply You have to write the following things:

1) date when You saw the RS (mounth and year- if You are not the owner);
2) nation where You saw the RS (or if You are the owner, nation where the
car was for the first time matriculated;
3) kind of RS (there are: BASE, TOURING-maybe just for Japan, LIGHT-maybe no
more then 100 models with the packet M003);
4) number of chassis (just the last four numbers);
5) colour of the body(if is the original or not, and please even the number
of color);
6) color of the safety bells and the write Carrera Rs inside the back cockpit;
7) if the chassis number is also on a small plate on the left side of the
vertical rod of the windscreen;
8) if the model is right or left way;
9) the capacity of the petrol tank (77 or 92 liters);
10) other extras not included in the series RS model (like Roll-bar for
races, anti-fire or air conditioned or radio);
11) mechanical modifications: like engine increased at 3.8 Liters, or breaks
of the RSR model, or other;
12) every other interesting new about the specified model.

I'll send this request every mounth in Porschephiles mailing list until the
end of 1995. I hope that You can help me; for the moment I have the
caracteristics of about 50 cars (most in Italy).

Sorry about that prior message. I have been in the middle of a large
conversation about the surging problems I have been having and thought that
was what you were talking about. should have read your whole message and
noticed the referance at the bottom. I have yet to have any good answers
back and am thinking that my original idea was correct. Either replace the
dash (if I can find a tan one available) or there are a couple of outfits in
Kelowna that do vinyl repair. The vinyl repair places do good work but your
cracks have to be fairly narrow. If they are like mine and have spred and
started to curl they cannot do a good job of fixing them. Th preccedure
takes about a day for them to get a good job out of it. The shortest I have
heard of is 6 hours so anyone that says they can do it quicker is likely as
not to do a poor job.
Ideally, the new dash is where its at but I don't have a clue as to the price.
Another option would be to have the dash redone from one side to the other.
All these options other than the fill job are a bit pricey.
the fill job will run me about 150.00 can. (about 50 cent usd ;+} ).

There are lots of things that can and do fail on 951's but the turbo is probably
not one of the more frequent items. It would probably be a mistake to purchase an
S2 because you're worried about turbo failure. You should drive both cars and see
which one you like the most. The turbo is about 600 lbs. lighter than the S2 and
and has about 5% more HP so it should feel more agile.

hod,
	concerning cracked cash repair, i know the cost of a new dash can 
be prohibitive and i just don't like those covers so i'm living wth my 
poor craking dash for now.  but i read in european car mag a few months 
back about a company in van nuys, ca that would basically rebuild your 
dash foam, recover it in vinyl, and dye it to the proper color.  the best 
part i thought was that they warrantied it for as long as you own the 
car.  the price for a 944 was about $500  I believe, i don't recall the 
price for the 911s.  the obvious down side is that youu have to remove 
the dash and send it to them.  i don't have the mag with me, but i 
remember the company was called Just Dashes.  if you would like any more

Subject: Handling/Driving Style


I've gotten a hoot outta the current thread. No issues here, but I KNOW
who I can beat just buy listening to what they say. The Reitmeier kids
use to watch all of us when we thrashed our stuff 20 years ago.

Maybe they saw something we didn't pay attention to. Larry Wong and I 
started beating Larry Wilson after we studied his Speedster and our 914 
2.0s. we were giving him a 400 pound advantage. We also weren't paying 
attention to our cars and it's features. Once we disconnected the rear 
bar and used the higher cornering speeds to our advantage, the Speedster
was history in autocrossing. Larry then bought a 914.

When I was learning to roadrace in the 60s, a friend and instructor 
gave me some good advice. If the corner is 45 degrees or less, late 
apex and drift it. If it is between 45 and 90 degrees, study the 
surface, the approaching corner and the corner following to see if 
drifting will help or hinder your exit/approach. If it's over 90 degrees,
study the corner for the smoothest way in and out, practice the corner
to get the best feel. Use the minimum brake necessary as late as 
possible, smoothly reapply the throttle.

It's wonderful that everyone talks about slip angles, etc., but the
big issue is whether you can step up and make it all work at critical
mass. Not all of us that are capable still compete. I get a kick out of 
Jeff and his wife and sister doing well. I remember that competing 
against their father was no picnic. 

On the other hand, it use to be fun watching a whole group of people 
tail Dwight Mitchell as he did his course walk. Dwight was (and still is)
one of the most articulate instructors on the sport of autocrossing.
His patience and willingness to show as he walked the course where the 
most likely line and method of driving the line has helped many novices
become excellent competitors.

Subject: 912 vs. Karmann Ghia


Help please.
I'm currently restoring a 71 Karmann Ghia convertible and I'm
thinking of unloading it in favor of a 68 912 Targa.
How would restoration of a 912 compare to the restoration of
a Karmann Ghia ($$ and ability to do-it-yourself) ?
One of my motivating factors is the lack of a real rear seat
and seatbelts for my kids. Does the 68 912 have a back seat, a
jump seat, or no seat ? Are there rear seatbelts? Does a car
seat fit back there?
I have $3K into the Ghia and it still needs about $4K worth of
work to be cherry. The ad for the 912 says: "new paint, seats, tires"
and they're asking $5500. - I still haven't gotten ahold of the
seller.
Does anyone have a checklist for inspecting a 912 prior to purchase?

Thanks,
Don

Have you checked your motor and trany mounts already?  If these mounts

    If I'm not mistaken, that company is called the "new dash group"... 
I've never dealt with them personally but I do know that all the hot
rod/resto guys are raving over them (because of their ability to repair
irreplaceable stuff...)  If I remember right, their average charge was

The entry "straight" is a series of lane change manuevers, allowing most 
street tire cars to enter around the same speed 50-55mph, regardless of 
horsepower.  The inside diameter, measured across the dotted line (which 
represents a crown line) was about 100 feet, the lanes were, say, 30 feet 
on each side, so the outside diameter is around 160 feet.

The next element down is way down there, probably 250 feet to the next 
braking point, so you should definitely use all the track width.

Absolutely right!  Nobody measured the next straight, and there's no doubt
that most everybody in the class was faster than me down that straight. 
(BTW, the folks that timed me said I was around .7 faster--remember I said
I was "more than 1/2 sec" faster.) Of course, this may have more to do
with horsepower than exit speed, in my case--remember I was in a 80 hp
914, versus 110 hp CRX's (almost as light as me) and 140 hp Sentra SE-R's
and NX-2000's, and even an older 240Z.  My point in all of this has been
(and continues to be) that I'll be faster "in the turn", and that often
(not always) my competitors with more exit speed won't be able to overcome
the deficit in the next straight...math follows for this example to
estimate that answer.

Scott, Scott, Scott...what fun is this going to be if we suddenly find 
ourselves in agreement?  The classic late apex, which I thought you would 
endorse, starts with a more sweeping, wider arc.  This allows a faster 
speed at point 1, which then translates to a faster exit speed and a 
faster straight.  The trade off is that the extra distance traveled from 
the start of the turn to point 1 is about 50 feet!  

Here's some math:  The "classic" line is traveling on an arc of about a 70
foot radius, for a speed of 32 mph @ 1 g, while Scott and I are going
faster at entry, only breaking after we've pitched it over the crest. 
Scott and I are both probably counting on throwing the rear end out in
order to get back on line (and on power) quickly.  At 1, we are slower,
since we're running a tighter radius, probably something closer to 40
feet.  That means we're going about 27 mph at point 1 (all things being
equal I'm assuming we are pulling 1 g as well).  However, at that point we
join the "majority" line, and accelerate just as hard.  We remain 5 mph
slower all the way down the next straight.  My calculations show that in
the first part of the corner, from the start of the turn to point 1, we
went 86 feet at an average speed of about 35 mph, taking 1.68 seconds. 
The majority went 137 feet at 32 mph, using up 2.92 seconds.  We are (at
point 1) 1.24 seconds ahead!  However, starting from point 1 and going to
the end of the turn both lines take us about 64 feet.  The majority, use
up only 1.36 seconds.  We use up 1.61 seconds, so we lose 0.25 seconds
here.  The total is that we were about 1 second faster IN THE TURN. 

What about the straight?  Assuming equal acceleration between the two 
examples, we'll always be 5 mph slower.  At that rate, we lose 0.18 
seconds for every second of acceleration.  So how long does the straight 
have to be for us to lose all of our advantage?  About 6 seconds (for the 
majority car--that's going to be 7.08 seconds for us), or, 
assuming constant acceleration of 0.3 g's (pretty good second gear street 
car acceleration), about 484 feet!  To put this in perspective, the 
classic line guys will be going 71 mph, we'll be going 66 mph.  Remember, 
484 foot straights are easy to find in roadracing, but are not the usual 
fare in autocrosses.  In my example the braking point was 250 feet away, 
so by then we've only given up about 0.65 seconds, so we're still ahead 
by 0.34 seconds. 

Interesting that Scott went to the shortest (and tightest) line possible
in this example.  How often do we give in to peer pressure and run the
sweeping late apex (larger arc) at the event, but only because we haven't
had a chance to consider the turn at length, as we have here?  Once again,
late apexes are a wonderful thing, but apply much less in autocrossing
then roadracing.  Be careful when you add distance for the sake of a late
apex (and faster exit speed) in an autocross--it doesn't always work. 

I would offer this rule of thumb.  In roadracing (or events with straights 
over 60 mph), when in doubt, late apex.  In autocrossing (or events with 
straights below 60), when in doubt, run the shortest line possible.  In 
both cases, you should finish the turn the same, that is, use all the 
track that's available without throwing your horribly offline for the 
next line.  Scott?  How do you feel about this rule of thumb?  Seem 
pretty close to you?

The 912 was introduced in 1965 - the same year as the 911.  The 912
was produced from 1965 to 1969.

The 912 was the "entry level" Porsche, costing about $1500 (25%) less than
a 911 of the same year.

The 912 was basically a 911 (same body, tranny, suspension, etc.), but with
a 616/36 engine from a 356SC (but with a different clutch/flywheel to mate
with the 901 transmission, and different sheet metal to mate up with the
911 engine compartment).

Hope this helps,

With the demise of the 356 in March 1965 there was a need to fill in the
space untill the 911 was established. Porsche took the 911 body & running
gear, but used the 356 1600cc flat four with either four or five speed tranny.
1st year 6440 were made against 4865 911's. The next year 8700 were made and
all in all when they quit making the 912 in '69 30,300 were made. It was
replaced by the 914.
It was reintroduced in 1975 for the '76 production, and sold only in the us
as a buffer if you like, until the 924 was ready. The engine this time was a
1971cc flat four vw developed by porsche, like the last of the 914/4s. 90bhp
at 4900rpm and according to my book, 2099 were made, mine is #472.

Subject: Re: Query on rebuilt 911 calipe

I have rebuilt my type M calipers and so far they seem to be just fine. 

Process I followed was to strip the caliper, cut some wood discs (using a hole 
saw) to fill the cylinders, seal the gap between the wood and the caliper (it 
was a tight fit), seal teh brake fluid line and then bead blast the rust off of 
them. I then painted the outside of the caliper using a Sikkens 15/50 blackwash, 
which according to them is good for high temperature and has truly awesome 
adhesion to  steel as it was designed for truck frames. From that point on it 
was straight forward, take out the wood blocks, clean, clean and clean the 
passages and cylinders just in case any dust or grit got inside, refit the 
pistons and seals and you're done. 

Mine were in quite good shape, no pits or corrosion on the inside, if I would 
have found a pit I would have turfed the caliper. The pistons had a very small 
amount of corrosion, I used a very fine emery cloth on the small spots and again 
no problems....

>Sean

One way to tell is to rev the engine to 5000 rpm, drop the clutch, then
count the number of burnout marks: 1 = non-lsd, 2 = lsd. :^) Another way
is to jackup the rear of the car (both tires off of the ground) then
turn one of the wheels. If they turn in the same way then you have the
LSD.

The LSD "senses" the speed differential between the two rear wheels. If
the difference is too great then it applies torque to the wheel which
has the slower speed.

Basically, what a LSD gives you is higher exit speeds out of a turn. If
you nail the thottle during a turn you will spin the inside rear
wheel. The LSD will apply torque to the outside rear where all of the
weight is anyway. Maybe someone will add/clarify my explanation if this
is not clear.

Adding a LSD to a 928 is not a trivial deal. A used LSD unit for a
'78-'82 from 928 International is about $500. Plan on 9 hrs (shop time)
to R&R the transmission, 10 hrs to rebuild, 5 hrs to set up the
differential, plus parts and anything else "while you're in there" (this
is for a manual).

I've just got my tranny back from the shop and had the LSD
installed. Whenever I get some time I'll finish putting it together. I'm
having serious p-car withdrawls.

Subject: Do I trade my Audi for a 944


	I own a 1990 Audi 90 Quattro that I am considering trading for a
944.  The Audi is worth about $13,500 if I sell it myself and has about
65,000 miles.  It's very comfortable, great in the snow, and has terrible
performance (it weighs way too much for its 5 cylinders).

	If I was to buy a newer 944 (say 87 and up), these questions are
needing to be answered:

	
	1)  Maintenance costs - the Audi is not cheap to maintain and only
the dealer can do A lot of stuff on it.  How is maintenance on 944 - both
big and small problems?  Are there any real problems to look out for (I
would really like a turbo if you guys think it's good - great to drive!!)?

	2)  Comfort - the Audi is very comfortable - I don't need a couch, but
would like something reasonably comfortable - I'm 6' 4" tall so I have tons
of height to pack into any vehicle.

	3)  Snow - how is a 944 in the winter?  This car will be driven every
day in the winter and has to get through a souther New ENgland Winter.

	4)  Parts availability - It seems that there are lots of 944s on
the road so parts shouls
not be stupidly expensive like a 928  (true or false).

	5)  How long do they last?  My Audis and Saab have always had great
relaibility well over 100,000 miles - how about 944 (assuming PO took good
care and changed the oil at least once every 50,000 miles or so  :)   )




	My budget will be 12,000 to 15,000 if I sell my Audi.  Any years
to avoid or years to look at in that range?


	Thanks,

	Sorry I'm considering a water pumper   :)    ,  but I already have
to air-cooled, so I should have the best of both worlds now.

Subject: Re: Do I trade my Audi for a 944

I sold my 77 audi fox in 1983 and bought a 944. Back then the hosepower
difference was a factor of two (76 vs 143)! I got tired of having the
porsche/audi dealer charge me porsche prices for an audi. I went through
several winters in Rochester NY with the 944, before I embraced the idea of
a "winter rat". I guess if you get snows on wheels you should be ok, except
for major snow on sidestreets, where the low ground clearance makes the car
into a poor snowplow. I remember crawling home late at night in the snow
and being blown off by a civic.

good luck,

     No. They are relatively lightweight, and you can easily swap the

     balljoint and bushings. They are from the VW Rabbit, so go to a VW

     parts department and save big bucks.



     However, I have had some TERRIBLE experiences with them. The SCCA Solo

     II stock class allows you to exchange the front swaybar. The only

     adjustable one I know of is the Weltmeister bar from Automotion. It

     mounts in the normal position on the aluminum a-arms, but you must

     drill a hole through the middle of the steel a-arms to mount it.



     Accident #1: I was autocrossing at Sacramento about 2 1/2 hrs from

     home. I was going around a 20-25 mph right corner when the a-arm

     snapped in half, right through the drilled mounting hole. Carroll

     Smith would say "stress riser". I would say SH*T.



     At the time I blamed my lack of mechanical aptitude. Since I was so

     far from home, I had the car towed to Dwight Mitchell's shop

     (Autosport Technology). $1200 and one week later, I had 2 new steel

     a-arms, a four-wheel alignment, and a crumpled left fender.



     Accident #2: About one year later, I was autocrossing at Pleasanton

     about 1/2 hour from home. I was going around a left-hand corner about

     30-40 mph when the a-arm once again breaks, right through the drilled

     mounting hole.



     Ken Mitchell (ex-GGR PCA member), bless his heart, helped me put my

     car on his trailer and towed me home.



     Now, I had matching crumpled fenders.



     If you want to go to another vendor, I understand somebody (Racefab?)

     makes competition a-arms. This month's Pano has an interesting warning

     from the factory concerning aluminum a-arms. Porsche is recommending

     the Club Sport arms for heavy competitive uses. They have a 951 part

     number instead of a 944 number.



     In the Northeast, there are a lot of stories about balljoint failures

     at speed on cars that have been lowered too much. The July 1 Driver Ed

     at Watkins Glen won't allow lowered 944s with aluminum arms to run.



Paul,
I have the 951, with the aluminum arms, AND mounting for the sway bar.
Given the warnings from alwyn springer (PCNA) in pano, I'm considering one
of the "race" arms you mentioned. His letter mentions that one of the
problems occurred on a car with stock suspension, and big sway bars. Well I
have the factory sport suspension (adjustible konis) and BIG (Tubular-30
mm) sway bars, but stock ride height.

Soooooo,

Am I in trouble? Will I go spinning down the back straight on three wheels?
No offence, but I don't want a paul foster autograph fender. I was
wondering about the various after market arms...I already have so much
beefier-than-stock stuff in there, I was hoping I could either, avoid, or
minimize the penalty of new arms.

thanks for the reply,

I like these generalizations, not because they're always accurate (we both
know they're not) but because they give you the basis of a PLAN.  I like
to drift the car on exit to most any turn.  Studying my and my wife's
G.Analyst traces (with the software I'm developing giving graphic
representations) we discovered that I'm always on the gas about a second
sooner than she is.  She complains that if she gets on that early, she
pushes.  The difference, we discovered, was that I drift the car early, so
that when I get back on it I'm inducing power on oversteer instead of mere
understeer.  That's a neato lesson and I hope she'll be able to apply it. 
OTOH, we examined our slaloms and found that Yvonne's more precise driving
was much faster than mine.  I like slip angle too much, and persisted in
throwing the car into the slalom, when a "carve" like Yvonne uses would
have been faster...

Bruce,

As a matter of fact, I did just change the oil.  How can I tell if the 
sump plate/scavenge tubes are installed correctly or misaligned?  It 
seemed that the sump plate only goes on one way (at least easily).  Is it 
possible for the positioning of the scavenge tube to change unknowingly 
as the sump plate is removed/replaced?

This has to be the problem since it has only occurred since changing the 
oil (I hope).

Subject: 911 1990 C4 Resolved studdering

Just an update...
I few weeks ago I posted a message regarding my 90 C4s problem of 
studdering, poor acceleration, lack of power.  I got a few responses and 
I have since had the problem repaired.  Wanted to bring ya' up to date.

RedNineCo suggested it could be the belt between the two distributors
and that was exactly what it was.  This was causing only one plug per 
cylinder to fire.  BTW, there were not any dash lights to indicate there 
was actually a problem.

I took the car to the local Porsche Dealer (Jim Ellis) in the hopes that 
the problem was a warranty issue.  The car has 48k miles so the emissions 
warranty (5yrs,50k miles) still applies.  And low and behold - it was 
covered.  Jim Ellis said it would be a $600 repair otherwise.  Probably 
could have been done cheaper if you just replaced the belt - but they 
replaced the whole distributor.

They also installed the vent hose to prevent this from happening.  They 
charged 1/2 hr ($29) labor and $9.14 for parts to install.

One other note - it took them 2 weeks to get the distributor in.
Car us back running great.

Subject: 911 Front Strut Advice

Pfellow Pfilers:

	I am in the process of dismantling the front suspension of my
'84 911 Carrera (I hit a curb).  Can some kind soul tell me where to
get the tool that takes off the nut attaching the strut assembly to
the lower suspension arm?

	Also, does any of the Denver area pfilers have a recommendation
on an alignment shop that is 911-friendly?

	Finally, after hitting a curb almost dead on hard enough to lift
the front end off the ground, bounding over the median, the only thing
I've found wrong with my car (so far) is a chewed up rubber bushing
where the strut assembly bolts to the tub and some minor cosmetic damage
to the right front wheel well.  I'm *much* luckier than I deserve, and
I'm very impressed with the strength of the car.

Dave ('84 Carrera Targa, up on blocks)

P.S.	I finally had occasion to hold one of the lugnuts in my hand.

The 911 came was introduced as a '65 model. The 912 didn't come out until 
'66. Because the 911 replaced the 356 as Porsche's flagship, it left 
sales lagging due to the high cost. Porsche thought and quickly decided 
to offer a more basic version that was basically a 356 that looked like a 
911 (gauges, VW engine pumped up, metal dash) and the 912 was born. While 
it was not cheap, it was relatively affordable compared to the 911.
The Boxter is Porsche's latest rendition of this old idea. Take a low

yourself a 'low-cost' Porsche. Porsche's 'low-end' models have been the

My 71E had wheel shakes too. Mine were not as large in amplitude as yours but
they did kick in at about the same speed.

In this case the shakes were due to front wheel bearings that were slightly
loose. When they were readjusted to their proper torque the shakes went away.

Best of luck at getting this resolved.

Subject: '92 RS America??


Based on my limited knowledge (learning a lot from this list though) of the
Porsche marque, I thought that the RS America was produced starting in the
1993 model year. This weekend the local Porsche dealer advertised a 1992 RS
America for sale. I assumed it was a printing error but could not resist
going down to the dealer to check out the car. In speaking with the
salesman, he claims that this car was purchased from PCNA and was used as a
display car for a while. He also claims that this is the only '92 RS in
existence. The car is red/black, lacks factory options and shows 11k miles
in the odometer . Could this be a unique RS, perhaps the only '92 RS
America and the first one ever made?

I'm planning on removing by fender-mounted oil cooler ('86 911 56K)  to

I've been meaning to ask this for a while now...

For as long as I've had my, the throttle on my '75 1.8l 914 sticks a little
in hot, humid weather. When it's not really warm, it never happens... It's
been an annoyance for a while, but since we're starting to get into the dog
days of summer in upstate NY, it's getting to be a problem. Looking at the
linkage on top of the engine, I see the accelerator cable leading to one arm
off the shaft, and there's another arm that attaches to the spring... But
seems to be not connected to anything. Is the spring supposed to be somehow
connected to the cable arm, to help bring it back? Or do I just need a new
acc cable?

Thanks!

No car is perfect. I've mentioned this story before... At our dealership we
had a '95 911 Carrera (sorry, I'm one of those "call 'em by their name"
folks) that was a demo of some sort... We were selling it as used, it had a
little over 5,000 miles on it. So it was DAMN close to being a new car.

A customer went for a test drive, during which the car stopped going into
gear. I helped tow it back, and believe me, that shifter wasn't doing ANYTHING.

Our Porsche tech dropped the engine and tranny, took the trans apart, and
discovered a shift fork shattered into three pieces. With less that 6,000
miles on the car!

Keep this in mind, any '95 911 drivers who like driving like Don Garlits. :)

>a chevy 350 in a 914?  What is the G-50 tranny?

Upfixin' der Prosche, available thru PCA national, Vol V, Page 300 has a
reprint of an article from Panorama, Nov 78, on converting a 4 to a 6.
 George Hussey of Automobile Atlanta also wrote a pamphlet on the same
subject that he seels for a few bucks.  AA is at 404-427-2844. Order Upfixin
from the PCA national office; call 703-922-9300 and they'll tell you the
price and how to order. Renegade Hybrids who I THINK advertises in Excellence
makes conversions to Chevys if you REALLY want to devalue a nice 914 to near
zero :). 

914/6 conversions will increase the value of certain, less desireable, models
of 914/4's IF DONE RIGHT. If you find a nice 2.0 914, leave it alone. If you
have a 70-72 1.7 with a bad engine or a 1.8, those would be reasonable
candidates for a conversion. Figure on $3000 for a decent used 911 engine
with Weber carbs, hopefully with a compatible flywheel and pressure plate,
(figure $450 more if without), $500 for engine sheet metal, $500 for an oil
tank, $300 for the oil lines and associated parts for the tank, $350 for the
engine oil cooler (less if you have the existing one modified), $300 for the
motor mount, $200 for necessary bits and pieces for the transaxle shift
linkage (less if you fabricate or mod some of the existing parts), $500-1000
for upgrading brakes/hubs to 911/914/6 parts, $100 to get the tach converted
to 6 cyl., $100 for a fuel pump, $500 for 5 bolt wheels to match the new
hubs, $500 for headers ($2000 if you want original heat exchangers), $300 for
a muffler, and another $300 to $500 for misc. parts.  Oh, and $100 for new
rear springs to support the added weight, and why go to all of this bother if
you don't make it handle with $500 in sway bars and $500 in shocks? You can
beat some of these prices by careful shopping at swap meets. You will NEVER
get your money back out of any conversion, and it may ultimately be cheaper
to search for a nice 6. 

If you think converting to a Chevy will be significantly cheaper, think again
about radiators, hoses, heaters, transmission beefups,brakes, mounts,
clutches, etc, etc.

G-50 tranny's were used in late model Carrera's and C2's and maybe the 993
(?).

	 I have faith  though, this gremlin's days are numbered. While hoisting

I posted about 5 days ago, crying because a woman backed into me, and requesting
recommendations for "top notch" body shops in the Bay Area.  Well, the votes
are in, "..And The Survey Says..." Cecil Beech's BodyStyles.

Seriously...Thanks to everyone (about 15+ responses) who gave me
recommendations for top notch body shops in South Bay Area.  The votes came in
as follows:

6 for Cecil Beech's Bodystyles
3 for Del's Porsche Auto Body
2 for Anderson-Beihl
and single votes for: Images, A&B, Yeaman, L&M, T&D, James Brooks, and
Cavallino

I could not check out all of them, but I did go by several.  All of them did
seem to do very good work.  Of course each had his own particular opinions of
my needs.  I think I will go with Cecil Beech's Bodystyles.  I was very
impressed with the extent of his estimate and the other cars in the shop.  His
finished repairs were nearly undetectable.  "Nearly" only because the repaired
parts had no chips or scratches and fresh undercoating.

So, for my car, Cecil is planning to completely disassemble the passenger side.
 Remove the front bumper, headlight and fender to take out a slight impression
where the damage started (about 4 inches from the door), and repaint the entire
quarter off the car.  Remove the door, and all extremity pieces, to take out
the damage along its length and repaint it.  Remove the Targa glass, engine
lid, and rear bumper so he can replace the rear quarter panel with a new one.
 Then top it off with a 4 wheel align (my wheel was bumped).

As I said, the repair estimate seems very detailed.  In total, it comes to over
$6000 including 75 hours of labor.  I'm sure glad it's not my money.  And to
think...the accident happened while neither of us were travelling more than 2
mph.

I'll keep everyone posted.

Hi Darrin,
The big problems (or normal maintenance items) are (a) clutch replacement 
about $450 parts and 9hrs labour  (b) timing/cam and balance shaft belt 
replacement with rollers about $140 parts and 4hrs labour.  You should 
consult the 944 FAQs for more info on these.  Other than that I have had no 
big expenses on my two 944s (over 5 years ownership)  My 5000 Audi turbo and 
turbo Quattro on the other hand was a heck of a lot more trouble, constant 
minor electrical problems and major ones with the steering racks, power 
steering pumps (seals always went) heater fans, leaky heater cores etc.  It 
drove me nuts - I believe Audi should have replaced their trouble light "!" 
with a "$" symbol which more accurately reflected what was in store for the 
owner when it came on.

Audi parts were another sore spot with me, $200 rubber bushings and the like 
for the quattro control arms.  You have a tremendous advantage on parts 
availability and choice of vendors/prices on the 944.  I will never buy 
another Audi for that reason.

(studded last winter) were fine.  Summer and All Season tires even with full 
tread depth are useless however.  I do have heated parking though.  Power

RIMCO has a very good rep in the VW market for doing high quality engine
machine work at a reasonable price. I have *NO IDEA* if they have the 
stuff to do this, but I'd bet that they do. And if you send them a fully
stripped carb lower body with just the shafts installed (nothing else) so that
all they have to do is pull the shafte, re-bush, and hone to fit the shaft,
they *MIGHT* be able to actually do it for $30. If you send them the whole
carb intact, don't bet on it for microsecond...

*HOWEVER* the real problem is that you also may need to have the throttle 
bores honed or rebored to a uniform size, and larger butterflies installed.
Not to mention all the twisty little passages filled with crap and corrosion.
There's much more to making a 30 year old carb run like new than just
the rebushing... I think that this is the source of the $175 each sorts
of numbers you've seen.

Subject: Any Experience With Defrost Repair Adhesive?

Hi Everyone.

The rear window defroster "tabs" on my car are no longer attached to the
glass and are pretty bent out of shape.  I would like to fix the defroster,
though.

I remember (vaguely) once seeing a Permatex or Loctite product for
re-bonding (directly to the glass) such tabs to the "pads" of the defrost
wires. Does anyone have experience with this product, and what's it called,
exactly? 

Thanks,

Subject: Experience with Short Shifter kits in 911

When I bought my 911SC a few years ago it had a Weltmeister
short shifter installed. It worked fine but was too short shifting
for my tastes. I removed it and put the stock shifter in which I
found to have very l-o-n-g throws. I finally settled on the factory
short shifter which is somewhere between the W and the stock one.
All of them are very easy to install. BTW I still have the Weltmeister
shifter which I'd sell for a substantial discount.

The 911 actually preceeds the 912 slightly, there were prototypes in 1963 and
production 911s in 1964, but the 912 appeared in production during 1965.
Obviously, the 912 engine(other than the 912E), being based on the 356 4 cyl
design, preceeds the 911 6 cyl design. There are differences other than the
engines, but in general the two cars are quite similar in other respects.

Andrew, I believe the Permetex/Loctite adhesives are insulating (correct me
if i'm wrong -- there might be something new I have not come across).  I 
used conductive epoxy, used by PCB manufacturing shops for touchup.  
Very low resistance, very high cost.  Approx $20 for a 10g tube.
If you know anyone inthe PCB business, you can scrounge a dollop for free.

Subject: RE: Do I trade my Audi for a 944


Two totally different worlds. The 944 will be more fun to drive
snappier handling and acceleration. I drive mine all year
(live in Anchorage, Alaska) and generally only have a
problem after a heavy snowfall. Can't get out of my
neighborhood if we get more than 8 inches or so of snow.
Buy good winter tires. Don't try to drive the same ones
all year. You'll end up in a ditch!

I don't know about your Audi but maintenance costs for
a late 944 are not inexpensive. We're not talking' your
basic Chevy Cavilier here. These cars were expensive
when new (my 89 was $36k) and the care and upkeep
is going to be higher, particularly if you want to get
long life from the car. I spend about $1200 a year at
the dealer, do minor maintenance like oil changes
myself. Some maintenance is done more frequently
than the service book requires.

Comfort - Go sit in one. I like mine fine, but I'm only 5'8"
Forget the back seat. Kids only.

Have no trouble getting parts. If the dealer doesn't
have it in stock, they air-freight it & have it within 2
days (their cost).

Have seen lots of 944s with over 75k. Don't know any
one with one over 100. Don't seem to have any
particular problems in cars that are well maintained.

You should be able to find a good post-87 for that
kind of change.  Look for things like ABS, 16" wheels.
Make sure to check when the cam/balance shaft belts
were changed!  Very bad (read expensive) results
when these puppies break. Change it before you
start autocrossing if it hasn't been replaced and the
car has more than 30k miles. It's expensive but
cheaper than bent valves and broken pistons.

The biggest reason is that the Fram filter sacks a pressure relief valve

Well, now, if he's the religous, stop by the road with the drain pan at 
exactly 3,000 miles or 3 months, it probably won't be a problem, but tell 
him to realize that in a 911 engine (you didn't say what year, so) there 
can be anywhere between 2 and 3 times as much oil as in a waterbox (9 
quarts to 13? quarts), and that the temperature of the oil is not 
significantly (it won't melt the thing down at it's post) hotter, it is 
hotter than waterboxes.

Hm... I've never had this experience, but then I have no Turbos. And for 
those of you wondering, there has never been anything but Porsche 
filters in our car ('cept for the air which is K&N). I do use Fram on the 
Toyota, and have had no problems, but then, on that car, I'm the

      I think "New Dash Group" is a different company than Just Dashes.
      The prices are not cheap, and the grain of the vinyl does NOT match
      OEM. But they are attractive for;
       1. Guys who CAN NOT get a replacement dash. You can still get OEM
           for a 911 and it is the "right" look.
       2. Guys who own Porsches (!) as they guarantee the dash for life
           and a Porsche dash will last no more than 10 or 15 years.

        You can probably get New Dash Group's phone number out of a 
       Hemmings.  I haven't used either but a friend was quite pleased
       with his Trans Am re-dash. Don't get the hard-plastic coverall; 
       my experience on a 924 and 911 was -horrible-. The fabric covers
       are an improvement over a warped leather dash, IMHO they look
       okay and are much cheaper than a new dash.

There is a HUGE volume of discussion of this in Pano starting from
about 1967 and going up until  oh I'd say the early '80s. Mainly
it goes like this:

CB:	"I'm a cheap bastard and can buy Fram filters for 1/2 what
	 the Mahle/Mann/German Purolator filters that Porsche sells
	 me. Fram says it'll work, so I'm gonna do it!"

VoW (Voice of Wisdom): "That's not such a bad idea. After all, oil
 	 filter are oil filters, and the factory didn't do such a
	 great job on the 356 oil filter, and Fram *IS* a name brand..."

CB (later): "Ummm. There was more to this than met the eye. Like now

CB:	"My oil filter blew up all over the engine compartment when I started		 the car cold one morning. Anyone know why? Anyone still listening		 to me? Hello?? Hell-OOO??"

My own experience: I've blown up even the hyper-expensive Fram HP-1 racing
oil filters on more or less stock *VW Beetles* with large capacity oil
pumps. These air-cooled engines are really *OIL COOLED* and as a result
move a hellishly large volume of oil at surprisingly high pressures.

Use the factory filter.  Or the OE equivalent purchased from a reputable
source.

Darrin asks a number of questions, among them, "2)  Comfort - the Audi is
very comfortable - I don't need a couch, but would like something reasonably
comfortable - I'm 6' 4" tall so I have tons of height to pack into any
vehicle."

Before buying the 944, Darrin, borrow it for an afternoon of driving to see
just how comfortable you may (or may not) be in it.  I'm also 6'4" tall and
find the usual 944 to be too cramped for my preference (limited headroom with
the sunroof and power seats, and limited elbow room with the power windows et
al).  On the other hand, if you can find one without a sunroof and the power
features, it may very well be acceptable.  A couple of months before buying a
new 924S (which is ALL manual and acceptably comfortable), I turned down a
great deal on a friend's almost-new 944 (usual equipment) because of the
cramped cockpit.  I also owned Audis continuously between 1972 and 1990, and
am enthusiastic about them...they're certainly among the best of the road
cars (they track like an arrow, are comfortable, quiet, reliable, and have
tremendous luggage capacity), they handle very well, have reasonable
performance, and (at least here) have outstanding dealer support...but I can
relate to the comments about pricey minor parts.  However, my 1980 5000S had
195,000 miles on the odometer when I traded it, and it still had the original
clutch (and all the other major parts)!

The 911 was actually introduced in 1964.

And, "The 912 was the "entry level" Porsche, costing about $1500 (25%) less
than a 911 of the same year."

Interesting comment.  While I don't recall 912 prices, I do remember the
difference between my 1965 356SC and a 1965 911 was closer to $500 ($5500 vs
$6000, approximately) so I would seriously doubt a 25% difference between a
1911 and a 912, even by 1969.

Derek says, "...a more basic version that was basically a 356 that looked
like a 
911 (gauges, VW engine pumped up, metal dash) and the 912 was born."

It would be more correct to say the 912 was basically a 911 with the 356SC
engine and a few minor interior changes.  And, by 1965 the 1600SC Porsche
engine was certainly not a "pumped-up" VW engine!

I suspect a 944 would be in the same maintenance price league as your Audi.

I have an 87 944S, which is the 16-valve non-turbo flavor.  I like it, haven't
driven a turbo.  On all of the 944 family, don't skimp on the suggested
maintenance intervals on the timing belt/balance shaft belt/rollers stuff on
the front end of the engine.  If you do, you could suffer valve/piston impact,
which is way expensive to deal with.  The belts are cheap, the tensioning tool
is not.  See the faq for a few other standard things to have checked before
you buy.

: 	2)  Comfort - the Audi is very comfortable - I don't need a couch, but

I'm 6' 6.5".  The 944, and the 924 it replaced, are the only vehicles I've
ever owned that I drive with the seat *not* all the way back!  It's quite
reasonable/comfortable to tilt the driver's seat back a bit and balance my
desire to be fairly verticle against headroom.  Even with the motorized roof
tilt, there's no significant reduction in headroom.

: 	3)  Snow - how is a 944 in the winter?  This car will be driven every
: day in the winter and has to get through a souther New ENgland Winter.

I haven't been through a winter with the 944 yet, but the 924 was fun in the
snow if I could get out of my driveway (sharp turn, steep hill, gotta have
4WD in winter to get out for long periods of time - I'm in Colorado).  I drove
from Colorado Springs south across Raton Pass into New Mexico in February on
packed snow and ice, knowing that once I crossed the pass heading for Tucson
I'd quickly be into weather where I'd pop the roof panel and switch to short
pants... :-)  The only heart-stoppers on that trip involved dancing with
semi's on the ice in the pass, which had nothing to do with what I was
driving!

Driving the 944S back across country from purchase in North Carolina, I spent
a solid day in near-blizzard conditions in Kansas, and other than being 
really nervous about bending my new toy, and having near-worthless tires for
snow, it wasn't bad at all.  The car has wonderful weight balance and overall
handling, so I had no trouble feeling when it started to get loose on the
snow/slush, and kept my speed "right on the edge" all day.  Actually, was
pretty fun in hindsight.  I won't be able to get it out of my driveway for
much of the winter, but if I get caught out somewhere, I won't dread getting
home in snow.  I'm sure the choice of tires plays a really big role here. 

: 	4)  Parts availability - It seems that there are lots of 944s on
: the road so parts shouls not be stupidly expensive like a 928 

Dunno.  The part's aren't cheap, but I suspect it'll be more like your Audi
and less like a 928.

: 	5)  How long do they last?  My Audis and Saab have always had great

I bought mine around 72k miles, now have about 77k, I see no reason not to get
to at least 150k with it, unless I do something really stupid.

: 	My budget will be 12,000 to 15,000 if I sell my Audi.  Any years
: to avoid or years to look at in that range?

My 87 944S was less than 10k, with fresh brake pads before driving cross-
country, and fresh belts/rollers in response to the bearings in one of the
belt sprockets squealing to signify imminent death, I'm still under $11k total
after the first 5k miles I've put on the car, which feels really good. 

: Sorry I'm considering a water pumper

Don't be.  I haven't driven anything made by our favorite marque that I didn't
think was a nice car.  The 4-cylinder water pumpers are a class of their own,
and I suspect if you find a recent vintage model in good condition, you'll
enjoy it a lot!  Very comfortable for long trips...

Subject: Overheating 912

I posted this a couple of days ago and I want to thank you  that replied, but 
so far I am still stumped.  I have some additional information that might help 
out.

Now that the temperature is hitting 90 degrees here in Oregon my 912 is starting 
to complain.  If the temperature is above 80 I can only drive for about 25 
minutes before my temperature gauge is horizontal and I notice a loss of power. 
 (I will eventually install a oil temp gauge, I promise!).  I think I know why 
the car is overheating but I do not know how to fix it.  I have a 1966 912 with 
an the air blower on the right rear side of the engine that splits into two 
vents approximately 3 inches in diameter.  One of the vents goes 
straight down into the rear engine shield above the exhaust pipe coming out of 
cylinder # 2.  The other vent is suppose to have a large (approx. 3 inch heater 
hose) connect to it and the heater hose should connect to a matching hole in the 
rear engine shield right above the exhaust pipe coming out of cylinder  #4.  
Right now I do not have the heater hose connected.  Now here's my problem.  The 
two holes in my rear engine shield for connecting the heater hose to are 
centered right over the exhaust pipes from cylinders #2 and #4.  I have no way 
to connect the two holes in the rear engine shield to the flapper boxes because 
the exhaust pipes are in the way.  I believe my engine is a European one  (the 
engine  Serial number is 832574), but the heating system is U.S. (I think?)  I 
would think that the additional air would help cool the cylinders but I can't 
see how to hook it up.  Do I have the incorrect rear engine shield?  All my 
other engine shields are in place except for the small one that goes under the 
fuel pump. (I'm painting it)  Is this missing heater hose my problem or could it 
be something else?  

Some additional information:

>From what I have read in Harry Pellow's books my car is suppose to be a European 
912.  I think someone at sometime tried to convert the heating system over to 
US???  Does anyone know of a good book that shows US heater systems versus 
European Systems on early 912's?  In my 912 if the temp gauge is horizontal it 
is in the middle of the range, halfway to the red.  The "red" zone is straight 
up top.  The car runs poorly once I enter the middle of the temp. gauge.  I have 
never had the temp. gauge read more then horizontal. At this point the oil 
filter canister is quite hot. The calibration of the temp. gauge may be way off? 
 My car has webers and there are no horns that connect to the carbs for cold 
starting.  I have the "Porsche 912 Handbook" (a orange cover published by Lash 
International) and the pictures on page 184 & 190 look exactly like my engine 
except for the air cleaners and the preheat hoses connected to the air cleaners. 
 The valves are properly adjusted, timing is at 31 degrees BTDC at 3000 rpm, 
Penzoil 20-50W and the engine runs strong on cooler days.  I have owned the car 
for about a year and the engine was spotless when I bought it and is still 
spotless.  Could someone explain the easiest way to get a good look at the oil 
cooler without pulling the engine?  It could be all clogged up, but I doubt it. 
 I appreciate your help!  TIA

Depending on my work schedule, I either drive mine every day, or

I think the important thing here is to *drive* it, not just start it.

You want to run it long enough to recharge the battery, and let it get
hot enough to get rid of all the condensed moisture.

"good street ride": Get adjustable shocks.  Koni's are good, KYB's

*are* weak.

Sway bars:  Get a front one.  It's not *that* expensive to have

Bruce,

As a matter of fact, I did just change the oil.  How can I tell if the 
sump plate/scavenge tubes are installed correctly or misaligned?  It 
seemed that the sump plate only goes on one way (at least easily).  Is it 
possible for the positioning of the scavenge tube to change unknowingly 
as the sump plate is removed/replaced?

This has to be the problem since it has only occurred since changing the 
oil (I hope).
**********************************

I knew this problem sounded familiar!

The pickup tube goes through the hole, not the other way.

The screen will go on 2 (two) ways.

With my car, it ran okay until I got on the power, at which time

It would appear that Byron and I agree much more than we disagree!!
Probably because I took the "always late apex unless it sets you up wrong"
approach and Byron takes the "examine the corner thoroughly then decide
what is fastest" approach.

Byron's approach ultimately is better but I am not sure that many of us
have the time to analyse every corner on the course to determine whether
or not an earlier apex through a turn costs us time or saves us time.

I still believe that over 90% of the turns I see on autocross courses
should be late apexed. Based on that, it is certainly better to err
on less than 10% of the turns than to confuse your self trying to figure
out every turn.

The good news is that as you autocross more, you get better and better
at recognizing what to do with each turn.

That is why I say: "When in doubt, late apex".

I'm also following the accounts of the wandering C-2s.

I've hesitated posting what fixed my 85 911 from wandering
because I didn't want to risk offending anyone.  But I don't
think anyone's suggested this yet so ... did you check 
that the tires are pointing in the right direction?  

I had some work done on my wheels and
suspension last fall and, when I got it back from the shop,
the car was all over the road.  It was kind of fun, but not
quite what I was looking for.  Turns out the right
rear tire was installed backwards so the tread was pointing
the wrong way.

Subject: 944 motor mount replacement?

I have the need to replace the motor mounts on my '87 944 and I have purchased
2 new ones (turbo style).  I had been given a great "blow by blow" document by
Karl Haug with instructions on how to accomplish this job but I've managed to
misplace it.  I have the Haynes manual (ONE picture!) and consider myself a
"fair" home mechanic.

QUESTION: Does this fall into the catagory of "don't try this at home"?  Are
there any "gottchas" I should be aware of?  Can this be done using the usual
ramps to raise the car?

Any opinions, encouragements, and/or discouragements welcomed.

76 or later for their galvanizing. Remember the later S models may not

Subject: Thanks and New Pics of RSR 3.4

I have recently posted some pics of my mostly completed RSR3.4 conversion
to www.warthog.us.udel.edu\timmins.html.

The car was painted then assembled in the five days preceeding my
wedding and was actually having the sunroof installed 2 hours before we
walked down the isle.

The photos are from the reception at Lydia's aunt's estate.

I would like to thank the following people for fianancial and other support, 
in no particular order:


Locals:

Sudhakar Reddy (Last minute help installing glass and doors)

Rich McKay (Much help - like installing sunroof and carpeting at 
	11:00 AM for my 2:30 PM wedding!)

Vince "Disco Vinnie" Suddard (Wheel Fittment)

Gene at HRE Wheels (Racer's discount on wheels)

Kevin at Racer's Group (Carbon doors, ducts, mirrors, rubber, and tail)


Lydia Reeves Timmins (For putting up with the last minute preparations)

Al Reeves (For coming down to help me install the inteior 2 days before 
	the wedding - now that's an inlaw!)
George Bukovsky (For supplying sunroof cables the day before the wedding)

Steve "Spin" Bonine (for arranging to get my car painted by DuPont)

My mother, grandmother, lydia, and mty father, for the 930 flares.


Netters and people who bought old parts:

Baram Peter - for supplying the C2-Turbo kit at a VERY reaonable price
Bill Van Bibber (Wheels WHeeLs wHeElS!)
Paul Joyce (951 Service Cover)
Jim Meyer (914 motor)
Paul Schlesselmann (Set of Wheels)
Colin Chin-a-loy (Wheels)
Harry Hall (Mirrors)
PAP (Misc Parts)
Gil Coshland (951 rear suspension)
Unknown Swapmeeters - misc 911, 951, webber, etc. parts totaling about $1200.

In any event, the car seems to be performing admirably, and now weights 2350
with 1/2 tank of gas and full of oil.

Mark,

Yes, I have pointed out to this list that Bruce Anderson is not God. But
never did I show such blatant disrespect for someone without cause. Sure,
Bruce does not like the '74 to '77 911's. With good reason. It is damn
hard to find one that has been "properly rebuilt". So why not just stay
away from them when you can get a better car, the 911SC, for just a bit
more money?

Subject: 914 Exhaust Nuts (NUTS!)

        Well, I must say that after trying the 40-cent 12mm exhaust
nuts that I got from GPR--"THEY SUCK!"
        These nuts have a hole through the center that is round at
the bottom (the way nuts are supposed to be), but is oval at the top.
The threads on the ovaled part do not mate with the threads on the
stud.  Wound up pulling an exhaust stud with it.   B^P
        If you have ordered these nuts, check them carefully.  You may
see some marks at the top of two faces of the nut where it seems to
have been squeezed.  If it has, it won't work correctly.
        I am going to re-use the four Factory nuts that came off the
car, and buy four more of the $11 list ($8.40 at cost+20%) 13 mm nuts.
Anyone have any other suggestions?
        I think I'll call up GPR and ask if I can have a $6.40 credit
on my next order with them...

Due to the rather unexpected loss of my job, I find that I must sell
my 944S.

The price is VERY low to sell it quick.  I can almost guarantee that the
first person who looks at it with $8000 in hand will take it.

If I'm forced to advertise it locally, it will probably sell for $10K.

The Car:

1988 944S
69K miles
all service records since new
top end rebuilt by an authorized p-car dealer at around 55K when the
timing belt broke.
new water pump, radiator, alternator bearings, new tires, refinished
alloys, etc etc etc
Immaculately maintained by Tony Heyer of Heyer Performance.
Great interior.
Great exterior - minus the slight rock chips you get in 69K.  2 or 3
dings total.

If you would like to take a look, please contact me.  Serious buyers
only!!

This is an early 1966 model 911. "S" models should have an S at the end. 1967
models started at around 307xxx.  There were a handful of 1966 911S, euro

306xxxS to 307xxxS range.

I've an '87 951 and it's much better than any Audi product, in my 
professional (as a car writer) opinion--except for the Audi V8. Anyway, 
go for the 951 and not the 944S. The S has little low-end torque, when 
compared to the 951, and is not the "bahn stormer" either. 

I've driven my 951 in the snow often, and it ain't bad. Then again, I've 
ABS and LSD on the car, so they help. Also, I used P-Zero's; with 
dedicated M&S tires, I imagine the car would be twice as tractable. 
Getting to the point--it's good in the winter. Mind you, it has a 50-50% 
distribution of weight. 

Go for a 951! Good luck.

I think the Lambo Diablo VT is the fastest 4wd vehicle ever made. 
Definitely faster than any Porsche street car ever made, including the 959.

Subject: 944 cam belt noise


gurus

changed my cam/balance belts at the weekend, set the tensions using the 
diffey empirical method ( yes I know I will buy one soon )

inspected the adjuster bearings, and noticed the cam belt adjuster was 
slightly noisy when spun in the fingers.

reassembled and found the belts were far noisier than before the change, 
done 700 miles since, and the noise level is now much the same as before

what is the risk with the old bearings, do they tend to fail or just 
annoy (will probably change them next weekend anyway)

I just had my oil changed yesterday and I'm pretty sure the oil filter was a
Fram. (orange?)  You've got me worried.  What's the problem and what
oil filters should be used?

Chris, have your friend cut open a Fram filter and look inside, it will  do all
of the talking.  Be sure its a Ford FL 1A (I think PH8A).  These  filter look
horrible when opened up.

To coin one of Stan's favorite phrases, "Sigh....."

You missed the single most likely cause of wandering, weight balance.  If you
have not had the car weght balanced, PRIOR to alignment, the car is most
likely acting like a teeter totter with the weight jacked between two wheels
diagonal to each other.  Get to a high performance alignment center, or a
major Porsche dealer that has the proper scales and get the car weight
balanced to within about 15 lbs. or so side to side with the drivers weight
in the front seat. That is the weight on the two front tires ought to be
within 15 lbs. of each other, as should the two rear tires. If the places you
took the car to be aligned look at you like you are from Mars when you talk
weight balancing, run like hell. I've transformed several cars from beasts
into lambs by proper balancing and alignment.  The idiot that told you that
air getting under the front of the car at 70 -80 mph is the cause of your
problems doesn't know his A-- from a hole in the ground. (Excuse my
french..., I just get pi--ed off about people that waste other people's money
because they don't have a clue).

I really hope this helps. I don't know where you live, but if you are within
200 miles of Cincinnati, OH, go to Bill Braucksick at Performance Alignment.
 I go there and I'm from Alabama...

Oh and by the way, a properly rebuilt 2.7 would cost a hell of a lot more 
than just dropping in a 3.2. My opinion is that 2.7's make great boat anchors.

Steve,

The '89 Speedster is a pretty rare care, only made in 1989 and in limited
quantities (I think about 1,000 world-wide).  That's probably the reason you
haven't seen many for sale.

The '89 Speedster has a turbo-like wide-body with a cropped windshield, and
therefore is a very distinctive Porsche.  The "new" (1994) Speedster does not
have the wide-body and looks totally different.  I like the 1989 model MUCH
better.  The 1989 also has the Carerra 3.3 engine.

I think it's a beautiful car and a great investment which can be found for about
$50k (see below).  Check Hemmings Motor News, the Porsche Market Letter, or
duPont Registry.

Hi,

I just watched an interesting bit on the Discovery channel's Beyond 2000
show.  It was about a "new" telemetry system that can be used to track cars
on a the track. I don't know how old the program is, as the Discovery channel
often shows old reruns, but it is interesting nonetheless. Check your local
listings, the Discovery  Channel usually runs the same show 2-3 times an
evening.

BTW, the segment is at the begining of the show and lasts about 5 minutes.
Enjoy

Hi P-Philers,

Back in the stone age when I was a BMW wrench and then service manager, 
we had some pennywise customers who would screw on anything that would 
fit.  The most amusing cases were the colder mornings when they would 
start their car and immediately drive off.  The oil filters without the 
pressure reliefs would then blow open at high rpm's and empty all of the 
oil out in short order.  The less intelligent customers would try to 
drive to the shop...

        From several people on the list, and one of "the guys" here at
work, I have found out that these are *lock-nuts* and that is the way
that they lock.
        I'm still not that pleased with them.  Also, the factory nuts
that I took off the car did not appear to be locknuts.  Anyway, I wound
up with some "other" copper-coated nuts to do the job.  They went on
quite a bit easier--though the anti-sieze may have had something to do
with that.  (DUH!  I *knew* I'd forgotten *something*!)
        Thanks!

Subject: 911 Ride Height Adjust. Question

Hey,

I adjusted the rear ride height of my 911 as a result of
putting some Koni shocks on a few weeks ago.  The Konis
actually lifted the rear of my car about 14mm (hence the
need for adjustment).  Anyway, the whole task was pretty
easy (thanks to a comment Mike Piera(?) made).  I 
needed to rotate the torsion bar relative to the spring
plate, but since I have the Sway-a-way adjustable spring
plates, I only took the "outer" part off and left the main
part of it bolted to the banana arm.  My quandary is that
due to the way the thing came apart, I rotated the inner
end of the torsion bar on one side and the outer end on
the other.  If I'm not mistaken this results in a difference
side to side of about 0 degrees 50 minutes.  I was able
to easily level the car using the spring plate adjustment
screws, and it seems that ride height is a function of
"torque" on the torsion bar, so even though I have this
slight initial difference in geometry, everything should
be OK, right?

What do you guys think?  Luckily, this whole job only took
me about 1 hour and 45 minutes, but I don't want to make a 
habit out of it.
