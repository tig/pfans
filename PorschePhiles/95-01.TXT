I don't think anybody on the Porschephiles list would think my C4 has a
turbo. The point was the absence of things that can cause tractability
problems, including (but not limited to) gear lash or "turbo lag."

Hi Steve,

It's a long story.  I'll try to find in in the archives, as I forgot to keep
a copy.  short version is that it tried to imitate an airplane with moderate

It's just my HO, but I believe that Porsche engineers recommend keeping the 
rubber-side down.  If they don't, I certainly do.  ;-)

It's pretty hard to tip a Porsche, but sh*t happens, so I suppose it can
be done if you try hard enough...

A few years ago (11/5/66) when I was a bit less wise and more intemperate, I 
unwisely went out on an all-night beer-drinking, skirt-chasing safari with 
a young Luftwaffe Feldwebel who was temporarily stationed at Fort Sill, 
Oklahoma.  

Unwisely, we took my '66 Corvette.  Unwisely, I let him drive when we returned 
to the Fort at 0500.  Unwisely, I slept while he drove.  Unwisely, he ran a 
red-light.  Unfortunately, a policeman observed this and started to pursue 
with lights flashing.  *Very* unwisely, the driver decided to take the on-ramp 
to the Turnpike to Oklahoma city and try to out-run the cop.  

I awakened when the car violently slewed out of control and launched itself 
into space as a speed the Oklahoma Highway Patrol report estimated to be in 
excess of 145 mph.  My eyes *popped* open to see nothing but brown, dead grass 
in the headlights, from what looked to be about 3 meters up in the air.  

The next thing I saw was a Nurse, 3 days later in the  Intensive Care Unit 
at the Ft. Sill Army Hospital, where they brought me.  I was brought-into the 
Hospital listed *Dead-on-Arrival* and left on the gurney for the 4 plus hours 
that they worked on the driver.  By the time they were done with him, they had 
typed a name tag for me and placed it in the holder on a drawer in the morgue.

The car, according to the OHP, cleared an AARMCO steel guard-rail, went some 
254' thru the air, landed on the nose, and went end-over-end for more than 
600'; coming to rest right-side up (*rubber-side down*, if you will).

Yeah, there's always a chance...  ;-)

apprpo 1st gear probs, when i learnt to drive in the 60's i was told if 
you cannot engage first ,release the clutch press and try again if this 
fails try putting it into 2nd then back into first.

I dont know if it is true but most cars of that era had straight cut 
first gears, hence the need to double bonk

I am led to beleive that double bonking modern trannys does more harm 
than good.

Subject: Double Clutching ... try thinking with a picture

Let's see if we can picture the transmission is ASCII
There are three rotating assemblies that can be either
coupled or de-coupled:

   1. The engine with RPM controlled by your foot
      when decoupled, by the road when everything
      is connected.
   2. The output section of the transmission with
      different RPM's for each gear connection point
      (lower gears turning faster) which is controlled
      by the road speed.
   3. The transmission 'input shaft and gears' which can
      be linked to either or both ends (clutch to engine RPM) or
      (synchronizers and dogs to a gear connection point).
      Left to itself, it will lose momentum and stop.

Connection points are indicated by '> >'.

                                    |
                           synchronizers and engagement dogs
                          'select one at a time except in neutral'

The game of preserving clutch and synchronizer friction surfaces is
to have the two sides of each connection point turning at the same
RPM when you connect them.  Shifting up, this means a pause for
the input shaft and gears to bleed off just the right amount of
RPM before engaging the next gear.  Shifting down, you have to
use the engine (throttle blip) to speed up the input shaft and
gears as they are turning more slowly than the lower gear they
are to engage.

That's the mechanics.  The technique has been described again and
again recently.  Go practice ... or just rely on you synchronizers
to do the job (as long as they last).  Note that it is good
practice on the road, not just in races or race simulation.
Just pause when upshifting and double clutch when downshifting
always.  If you anticipate downshifts (aware driving) you usually
don't need 'heel and toe'.  It's good machinery.  Be kind to it.

Hi, Richard.
 
If Tony Lapine really said that, I guess we have to take it at face value.
Tony is a real character. If he was quoted directly, then it MAY be true.
Otherwise, it may be some hack writer's revisionist interpretation of
history. The trouble is that people think anything in print MUST be true, or
they wouldn't be allowed to print it.
 
In the book "Projekt 928" by Julius Weitmann and Rico Steinemann, there are
styling studio concept sketches of the 928, one of them very close to the
final form, dated Nov. 19, 1973.
 
Does it say if the air sickness bag that spawned the Gremlin was full, or
empty?
 
I find it a little odd that of all the hundreds of thousands, maybe more
than a million, Hornets, Gremlins, and Pacers built, you never see any on
California's roads. (Nothing ever rusts away here.) But other cars from the
same era, or even older cars, are fairly common. Same thing goes for Vegas
and Pintos. Hey, these might be future investment items -- just think of it,
if we act now, we each could own "one of only six Chevrolet Vegas known to
exist." Which should make them as valuable as, say, a Bugatti Royale. Then
we could sell our two Vegas to Rick Cole, who will then own ALL of the Vegas
known to exist, and he will confidently predict that the price of Vegas will
be going even higher. Want me to start looking for good, one-owner Vega GTs,
low mileage, owned by little old ladies from Pasadena? (I did a story on the
Cosworth Vega a few years ago for Automobile Quarterly. There is an active
club, which trades parts back and forth and tries to keep the things
running. It's still a Vega, spiffy cylinder head notwithstanding.)

Hi gang,

Occasionally, I had a similar problem with my 914 grinding when
trying to shift into 1st at a dead stop.  I found that by shifting into 2nd
and releasing the clutch to barely move the car then shifting back
into 1st worked for me.  Don't know why....it just worked.

About building a 911 engine stand from a domestic V8 750lb
capacity stand....be careful.  I know 2 guys who did this and one
guy is real happy, and the other was wondering what the hell was
going on when the engine he was working on was slowly moving
towards the floor!  Both of these stands were purchased from the
same place, but one had a drastic problem - it couldn't support
a 300 pound 911 engine!!!  Now Stu has welded 3 supports to
the main upright to make sure this won't happen again.

Kinda reminds me of the 6000 pound jackstand which broke on
me - it was only used a few times to hold up one side of my 914.
I sure am glad it didn't decide to break while I was under the car!

Take care....and have a SAFE and prosperous New Year!

Subject: Decisions..Decisions...

I think I'm going out of my mind. For the last couple of months I have been
trying to decide what car to buy. I have narrowed my choices to the Mitsu
3000 GT VR4 (92-93), Nissan 300ZX Twin Turbo (91-92), and my long time
obsession, the Porsche Carrera (87-88). My main criterion is performance,
0-60 & 1/4 mile times, handling, etc. The 2 Japanese cars have gotten
excellent reviews in all the big auto mags, and I'd be looking at much newer
model years. They have alot of the hi-tech bells and whistles and nice body
styling.  The 911, as you all know, has much more simplistic styling with
alot less electronic gadgetry, and in the model years I'm considering did not
perform as well. It would probably also cost much more to maintain. But it's
a PORSCHE. I get to the point where I purge any thoughts of the 911 from my
mind, but then I'll see one on the street or on TV or read the P-philes list
and I'm back at square one. Has anyone been in a similar predicament? Has
anyone owned either of the Japanese cars? What would you recommend?

P.S. Budgeting would be a major issue in any choice I make. The car would
also be my daily driver.

In Issue #1038 <readsickt@lablink.ple.af.mil> asked some 914 questions (some 
of which I don't have an answer for . . .)

(3)  Is $270 for aset of factory manuals a good price?  Unfortunately, yes.  
The best price I had seen was $308 and I think that supplier raised the 
price recently.  I was able to pick up an *incomplete* set from Walter 
Miller booksellers for $75, but it is missing the volumes on the 4-cyl fuel 
system and the electrical system.

(4)  How do you remove the CV joint retaining flange?  According to the 
factory manual:

        "i)  Unlock castle nut of universal shaft and loosen.
         ii)  Remove heat exchanger.
        iii)  Loosen cheesehead screws of universal shaft on universal 
flange.  Use flat chisel
               to separate universal shaft from universal flange in range of 
flange seal and
               remove universal shaft.

               *Caution*  Do not damage flange surface."

Installation seems to be pretty much the reverse after making sure all 
surfaces are clean and smooth.

Subject: double clutching/speed shifting

Someone enquired as to the relationship between double clutching
and shifting without a clutch.

If you aren't using the clutch, it is a little more difficult
getting out of the initial gear. You must adjust the throttle
so there is no load on the tranny or drive train. Then you can
slip into neutral.

Next you adust the engine speed to the appropriate level for
the next gear, then you should be able to slip into that gear
without having ever touched the clutch pedal.

If you downshift without using the clutch, you are still doing
essentially the same thing that you do while double-clutching,
i.e. you blip the throttle with the clutch out in neutral
and then slip into the lower gear.

Upshifting without the clutch is sometimes called speed shifting.

Some sports car racing drivers don't use the clutch.

I think that you can go faster IF you can proficiently shift
without the clutch, but there is very little margin for error,
i.e. if you don't get exactly the right engine speed you will
miss the shift and lose lots of time, as well as really torturing
your tranny.

I don't recommend shifting without the clutch on
your Porsche. If you are curious, try it on a beater.
(I learned it on a seemingly indestructible '62 Ford Falcon).

With magnesium cases, the recommendation of record is to use dilivar
all round.

With respect to the CV's, I assume you already have the circlip off
and want to drive the inner race from the splines.  I put the half-
shaft in a vice, to start.  I am generally able to remove the CV
by tapping around the circumference of the inner race with a hammer
and drift.  Once in a while, this gets me nowhere.  In that sort of
case, I douse with penetrating oil and use a gear puller.

If you can convince yourself that both CV's are junk, you might
save yourself some effort.  A lot of the time, buying two new CV's
already mounted on a half-shaft is cheaper than buying the two
separately.  (However, the supply of these set-ups has been a little
spotty in the last half year.)

Hope this helps.

IMHO the nicest enclosures I've seen, and the cleanest installation. As 
I mentioned earlier, when I bought mine some 10 years ago, the speakers 
they used were pretty louisy. They've been bought out since then so 
maybe the speakers sound better. I replaced the subs with JBL 8" 
speakers and was going to swap out the mids & tweeters with Boston 
Acoustics. The mids are 4". It doesn't matter where you mount the subs 
since they are non-directional. What is important is to have the proper 
size enclosure for the speakers. What I liked about the z-boxes were the 
front satellites where mounted in the foot wells, angled up and in. The 
rear satellites were about head height and angled in. All the music was 
right around your head instead of around your knees(speakers in doors). 
The system in my '73 targa was tri-amped, 150 watts to the subs and

Potential pros (and related questions):

     - from what speed noticeable?
2.  Oil cooler mounted in rear spoiler --> exposed to higher pressure
     (=more mass) air flow - is the effect noticeable?

     or any of the above?  If the latter, how to tell which it is?
2.  Can a rear spoiler, once installed, be removed with no residual damage

Subject: Re: traction issues, or 4wd vs 2wd and rear engine

To Sam's comments -
In principle, all other things being equal, vehicles with rear weight
bias tend to be less stable in a straight line and more "ready to turn"
(overtseer tendency).  Remember the arrow with heavy head vs.
heavy tail analogy.
Transmission of power through the rear wheels can modify this
behavior - either amplify or attenuate - depending whether under
power or overrun/trailing throttle, whether combined torque and
cornering force is high enough to cause tire breakaway, on
suspension geometry & compliance, etc.
Much of this yaw stability problem can be reduced (and in theory,
eliminated), by using unequal tracks and tires front to rear.
The main advantage of the rear engine is in longitudinal traction - both in
2WD acceleration and in braking.
The combined blessing and penalty we get is the "interesting" handling (yaw
behavior), which some people (i.e., GM after Corvair
and Nader) deem not consistent and foolproof enough for the
whole driver population, or too difficult to develop to its state
in contemporary 911/993's.
As to C4 and 959 history, I'll defer to more knowledgable
Porschephiles.

Subject: One more on Double De-Clutching

To Mike Paradiso's question, in case it wasn't fully answered,
"why it is better to blip the engine with the transmission
in neutral and clutch out rather than transmission in gear
and clutch in" -
The answer is it is better if your goal is to shift a non-
synchronized transmission or to conserve your synchro's.
With the transmission in neutral and the clutch engaged,
you are able to accelerate the input shaft by revving the
engine to the target speed it should have in the next lower gear,
or slow it down by dropping engine revs to correspond to its
target speed in the next higher gear.
You need to have the clutch in to allow the engine to talk to
the transmission.
(You may need your lawyer to make sense out of the above verbage,
I don't know how to say the above more coherently).

However, if all you want to accomplish is smooth torque pickup
upon clutch engagement, it doesn't make a difference.
Yet, by using the former method (clutch engaged), you can
accomplish both.

Never seen this. The A/C condensor is usually mounted there, and does

All of the above. And no, like many things on the 911, you can't tell
a really well done aftermarket install from a factory job, or a bad
aftermarket job from a bad repair on a factory job... The *only* way
is to run the VIN number and see if it's supposed to have the spoiler
package.

No. Some assembly required. You *WILL* have to repaint, maybe do some

Sam, try to go up a slick snow covered hill in your SOB, you can't! (Unless
you
put it in reverse and go up BACKWARDS!) A rear-engine Rear wheel drive
will make it up much better than a FWD car going forward, due to the
weight transfer of acceleration and pointing up hill.

As for powering out of skids, if you apply power to a FDW car in a skid,
you will simply go straight off the road. The front end will not have enough
grip to turn the car, if it did you wouldn't be skidding!

A 911 will have very good traction, but needs lots more driving skill to
avoid spin-outs. But 911s have won the Monte Carlo Rally and others
in snow, so with lots of skill and a little luck, they can be fast.

Subject: Re: Decisions..Decisions

Skater,

The cars you have mentioned are all excellent choices. My recommendation to
you; don't buy the Porsche. In virtually every category of
comparison-handling, power, styling, quality, practicality, and ownership
costs-the Porsche comes in second (or worse). 

Handling: Much has been written regarding the "unusual" handling
characteristics of the 911. I think Porsche factory engineers said it best in
an internal memo that was at the center of a product liability law suit
several years ago involving a traffic fatality. The Porsche engineers
described the handling characteristics of the 911 as "viperous." For the vast
majority of drivers-myself included-that memo says it all.

Power: The low-end torque of the 3.2 engine is nice. Top end is good too. The
"kick in the butt" boost of the turbo is a thrill. Still, the Porsche will
lose a stop-light drag race to cars costing 2/3rds of what you'll pay for a
911. And if there are any turns required in your little speed contest... see
"Handling" above.

Styling: Lot's of sexy cars on the sales lots these days. The thirty-year old
styling of the 911 looks its age when parked next to some of Japan's best.

Quality: BMW, MBZ, and even Honda come out on top in this category. But
Porsche is a "hand built" motor car, right? Exactly, and the robots do it
better.

Practicality: A two-seater is never practical. Still, most modern sports cars
can navigate a moderately angled driveway without scraping the underbody. The
911 cannot. You'll work up a sweat wrestling the steering wheel of your 911
while trying to parallel park, and you'll end up three feet from the curb in
an effort to keep from scraping those $900 Fuchs. You'd better take your
buddy's Nissan to the golf course; no room for your clubs in the 911.

Ownership Costs: $250 per headlight? This is a joke, right?

I can think of a dozen reason why you should not buy a Porsche, and only one
reason why you should. You said it yourself in the second sentence of your
post. You called the Porsche Carrera your "...long time obsession." If you
have the means to purchase a Porsche and are still considering another
automobile, your obsession factor may not be sufficient to overcome the
deficiencies mentioned above, in which case, you may be happier with another
car. For those of use who are truly obsessed with the marque, there can be no
other. Good luck.

Does anyone know if the G-50 and G-50/50 being advertised by Patrick
Motorsports for pre-89 930's (Without torsion tube modifications) will hold
up?  The local dealer say's that the only difference is in the gear/ratio.
 Other indepentent shops say that the G-50 that the factory used in the 89
Turbo's has stronger gears. The price is resonable when compared to a RUF 5
speed.  The car is used for track events most of the time. If anyone has any
actual spec's on the two tranny's or first hand knowlage of this conversion I
would appreciate it.  Thanks in advance.

Everyone,
	I have a 78 SC coupe that I am having trouble with.. I bought
 the car with 56K on it in July (not 156K, 56K) from a friend and fellow
 p-phile. Anyways the car has been great until about a month ago..I went
 for a drive and the car, though it ran fine, had no power... This is to 
 say that I could drive a 60mph no problem but I couldnt pass anyone..
 I got out of the car and noticed the smell of buring leaves or twigs
 though I cant tell where it came from.. Anyhow I figured something must
 have crawled up my tailpipe and made a nest or something.. Then the smell 
 went away though my performance never came back.. Anyhow not haveing a 
 spare muffler or any idea how one would test to see if it were clogged 
 much less un-clog one, I removed my converter and looked around.. I didnt
 notice any nesting materal or any smell or anything.. I did notice that 
 on the driver side the three tubes on the heat exchanger where the converter
 bolts to the exchanger where white while on the passenger side they were 
 a dull gray... I though I may be running lean/hot on this side or in general.
 I pulled the plugs and read them.. They were all light brown.. I installed
 my CIS guages and all of the pressures are normal.. The car starts and runs
 normal (no pops,snorts backfires or anything) it just has no power. I checked
 my ingnition and it too is normal..
	I installed my test pipe in place of my converter with no difference
 in performance. I am wondering though is the white colour on the three heat 
 exchanger pipes normal?? my temperature guage reads normal.. I hear no pinging
 whe I drive.

	Anyhow I'm stumped... Unless there is somthing someone can suggest 
 and after I complete a compression test I'm afraid II may have to buy new
 exhaust components...

	any help would be greatly appreciated...

I think my decision was cemented when BMW decided not to
offer limited slip diff as an option on '95 325's, only traction
control.

As to 3000GT VR4 and 300ZX TT vs. Carerra -
Which one do you enjoy driving the most, assuming you've tried them
all in reasonably comprehensive test drives?
If you haven't, drive all three cars, preferably along same representative
route, and let them talk to you.
Ask yourself how much power you really need to be happy, vs. what

said:

That's truly the classic YMMV case!  I personally have found the 911 styling
to be timeless, and have been hopelessly smitten since the first one I saw,
on the streets of Wiesbaden, in November 1964 (I'm sure it was a 901, but
that's a lot of years, so...)

> Quality: BMW, MBZ, and even Honda come out on top in this category. But

This is another YMMV.  I've owned a couple of MBZs, and while both were
high quality cars, I've *never* seen fit *or* finish superior to my cab.

Finally, when you drive a 911, you have the satisfaction of knowing you are
driving one of a very select breed.  Along with one Ferrari or another, the
911 is the one car that will be on every knowledgable enthusiast's list of
the top ten sports cars ever made.  That's definitely a FWIW issue; which,
in the final analysis, is what the whole business of buying a sports car is
*all* about...

I'm sorry, but in my eyes, the Carrera is not a loser when compared to a
3000GT/300ZX/et al.  As far as handling goes, if you are a good enough
driver to discern (and fret) over the small differences in skidpad
ratings, etc., then more power to you.  For 95% of drivers out there,
the Carrera is more than capable.  IMHO, the "viperous" oversteering
characteristics of the 911 is somewhat of an urban legend nowadays -
it's not really that bad.  As for the power - something to consider is
the weight of the cars.  I don't have the numbers handy but I bet the 
911 is lighter than most of its competitors - that means alot.  Styling?
Subjective category.  Quality?  Look at 10 or even 20 year old 911s.
They seem to be holding up much better than - well just about every-
thing else.  Sounds like quality to me.  Practicality?  I driven 3000GTs,
etc.  Practicality is relative (don't give me no steenking cup holders!).
Ownership costs?  Factor in resale value and the whole picture changes.

Sorry for the line-by-line rebuttal, but I found it hard to believe these
T*d-like statements came from the owner of an '87 Carrera!  Maybe I'm
a glutton for punishment, but I'd pick the pcar over anything else in the
same price range.

It seems that the lawyers who engineer our products today prefer this to

Hi, Sam.
 
The best car marque book ever written is about Porsches. Get Karl
Ludvigsen's "Excellence was Expected", about $85 I think, and well over 800
pages of carefully researched history. It is the standard by which all other
car histories are judged. It was written in 1978, I think, and was never
updated, but it has never been beaten either as a general history.
 
There is a new 911 history book coming out this spring, with less of the
corporate history and more specific 911 history. "Porsche 911: Forever
Young" by Tobias Aichele. Look for it around April. It is up to date up to
the 1995 Carrera 4. and Tiptronic S transmission. About 400 pages.
 
Brett Johnson's "911 Restorer's Guide to Authenticity" covers some of the
appearance differences between models and years, but not the engineering and
mechanical stuff.
 
There are other good books out there, but most were written in the late 70s
and are threfore dated. Paul Frere's "Porsche 911" is a nuts and bolts
development history. Juergen Barth's "Porsche Book" has a few mistakes but
is a rough year-by-year guide to model differences.
 
The best and just about only book on how to tweak the thing once you have it
is "The 911 Performance Handbook" by Bruce Anderson.

Subject: Chips for '86 928S

Hi,
I'm looking for some net wisdom on the subject of installing modified
ignition/fuel control chips on an '86 928S.  I am aware that there are
dramatic increases in power on turbos such as the 951 when chips are
used, but my understanding is that that effect is made primarily
through increase in the amount of boost and RPMs allowed by the
modified DME.  The '86 928S is not amenable to boost changes, so
how much improvement can be expected by just remapping the fuel/
ignition profiles?
Does anyone have any practical experience with chip modifications
on this engine?  Also, how do the Triad chips advertised in PANO
compare with the more common chips from Autothority?  The Triad
chips are selling for about 1/3rd the cost of the Autothority
chips.
Thanks for any information you may be able to give me.

Peter,
	The way I always understood it (please correct me if I am 
wrong), carbon is a problem because it can get hot enough to glow and 
act like a glow plug causing the air/fuel mixture to ignite earlier than 
it should. This can cause knock and subsequent damage. I agree, however, 
that most modern engines have little problem running at low revs, in 
this sense, because of the EFI's efficient control of the air/fuel 
mixture such that it burns more thoroughly, even at low revs. I do agree 
with others about the bearing wear at lower revs though (due to the 
pressures of combustion at slow revs). I know that it is certain death 
to run my Cosworth engine at low revs in my 7. It also seemed to me that 
at the factory they told us not to run around in too high a gear with 
the 911(?)

Hi,

As to what car to buy? Since you're very concerned with acc. I've included
the test-values of a couple of the cars as well as other cars that might
be interesting. I know the 993 and a (almost) new 911C2 is quite expensive,
but it's interesting to compare these, since a few people claims the
Porsche's are the slowest in the flock, which they (in my experience)
definately is _not_. (I couldn't find the values for a stock 3.2, sorry)

The testvalues below are taken from the German magazine 'Auto, Motor und
Sport' which is the one of the most esteemed magazines in europe. (I don't
know if the BMW M3 has hit the american beaches)

All speed is measures in km/h. Weight is kg and measured in test. Price is
thousand DM and was the price, when the car was tested (without options).

(For all you americans with weird units :-) : 
 60km/h=37.3mph, 80=49.7, 100=62.1, 120=74.6, 160=99.4, 200=124.3,

Compare this to for instance my 911 3.2. It's got 245HP and weighs
1250 kg. This means I have 5.1 Kg/HP - which is marginally less than a 
993, but better than a 911C2. (Agreed my car is a bit modified, but not 
much. It it, naturally, a euro Carrera (no cats))

In europe the 300XZ, 3000GT and RX-7 is normally not even compared with
the 911, but with the 968 where the performance is just about equal, 
with the 968 being a bit behind. Only the Toyota Supra is being compared
to the 911's...

I've tried a dragging against both a GT3000 and a 300ZX - none of them 
could keep up. I was about 40-50 meters in front of them when I hit 180 km/h.

On track I've also tried dragging a 911C2 and I was faster than that 

one too. Only marginally, but enough to pass him on a long straight. I won't 
begin to compare driving around the corners, since my 911 has a non-stock setup
(equally fast as a C2 with my narrow-body 3.2 targa).

I haven't tried driving against any of the other cars on track, so I will
not say anything about this..

Another thing is that it's easier (and _much_ cheaper) making a
turbo-charged car go faster. You can easily modify it by turning
up the boost preassure (Well, not all _that_ simple if you want it to
last, but you get the picture).

I'd strongly recommend trying to go for a spin in the cars you're
considering and letting the car "speak" to you.

About the price: Yes, the 911 is expensive. Yes, it's expensive
to maintain. However you also have a better resale value of the
car. The japanese metal depreciates _very_ quickly. I'm using
mine as an every day driver too, but it _is_ at a high cost.

I think that if you want better comfort, more gadgets and a newer
look (that will be outdated in 3 years), get a new japanese car.

But if you like Porsches: There can be only one...

Subject: Rain and an '84 944

I recently purchased a 1984 944.  The car has been working really well
 except for one problem.  Whenever I drive the car in the rain the floor
 becomes wet.  The passenger side is is far worse then the driver side 
and the front is worse then the back.  I have assumed since the floor 
becomes wet only when the car is driven, that the water is being splashed 
up from underneath.  Upon investigating the underbody, I saw only one 
obvious opening... but it looked suspiciously like a drainage hole.  
The hole is behind the front wheel and a bit towards the middle of the 
car.  Has anyone out there had a similar problem?  I am inclined to try 
blocking the hole, but it looks like it was placed there on purpose... 

 Any ideas would be appreciated.

Hey everybody,

Does anyone have some real world experience with Bursch
mufflers?  I'm thinking about putting one on my '76 911
(stock 2.7liter).  I heard that without replacing the stock
exhaust system, the Bursch alone wouldn't give me much
of a hp gain, but, for me, SSIs are a bit more than I want
to get into right now.  Are the Burschs good quality?  Do
they last pretty well?  Exactly how loud is it going to be?
I hate to admit it, but the exhaust note is one of the main
reasons I'm considering doing this (and the fact that my 
19 year old stock muffler is pretty rotted out).

Any comments/criticisms are welcome!

Since this will be my fist real sports car, I wanted something to play with

This is a Bad Idea in all cases. Any Porsche looks to most cops like
it has "TICKET ME" printed on the back window. It also is a sign of 
either a lack of maturity or a lack of knowledge. I'll assume it's a 
lack of knowledge, and offer something for you to think about:

True "sports cars" are all originally of European design. They were
designed around *road racing*, not drag racing, which is a purely American 
phenomenon. In road racing, where originally the goal was to cover some 
amazingly twisty chunk of European roadway, often with great elevation 
changes, between two places, you need a *BALANCED* car -- great handling, 
good power to weight ratio, acceptible acceleration, great high speed
stability. *THAT* is what the 911 has.

American "muscle cars" are designed for something completely different --
raw straight line acceleration. I once had a '73 Mustang with the '70 
Ford NASCAR SOHC 428 engine, making about 650 HP at the rear wheels as 
I was running it then. *UNBELIEVABLE* acceleration. But God help you if 
you needed to turn while underway, or for that matter STOP suddenly. 

As to your "need for speed" deal, I highly suggest that you join the PCA
and take your new 911 to autocross and drivers' education (learning to
drive at speed on race tracks) events, where you can get much more 
satisfation that you can possibly imagine. And no tickets.

Unfortunately, you're probably out of luck unless you can get someone who saw

After you've complained to the Manager, I'd suggest you ask (or call
information) for the 800- Goodyear Customer  Relations number.  It probably
won't produce results, but at least you can do some "venting" with them about
their dealer.

Porsche dealers, even though they should know the car, can do the same thing.
 Although you have to learn the hard way, on routine things like leakers, I
remove the tire/wheel and carry it in....but they can still mess up the alloy
rims on tire removal unless you watch them.  Most "general service" shops
like Goodyear don't like customers in the service bay.

Subject: Re: Decisions... Decisions

Skater,

Bart and Mike D. speak the truth. Issues like styling, quality, and resale
value are subjective. Even performance figures don't always present a clear
picture. I think the point I was making when I suggested that you not
purchase a Porsche was that the satisfaction of Porsche ownership comes from
more then the sum of  it's parts (or performance figures). It's a visceral
thing.

In your original post, you were attempting to quantify the merits of two nice
Japanese autos with those of a Porsche. Although it is difficult for me to
admit, I believe that the Porsche comes up short in many of the categories
that you mentioned. 

A little story: I have owned (and sold) several sailboats over the years.
Owning a sailboat is a lot like owning a Porsche (stay with me on this, it's
going somewhere, honest). When it comes time to sell my boat, occasionally an
interested party will tell me that he's undecided on whether to buy a
powerboat or a sailboat. In almost every case, I'll recommend that he
purchase a power boat. You see, sailing is a lot of work. But a sailboat
owner will sacrifice things like comfort, performance, and utility in order
to enjoy this specialized vessel in much the same way a Porsche owner will
likewise make a few sacrifices. If the buyer doesn't "get it" (the visceral
thing), he/she will be disappointed.  (Once a guy told me he couldn't decide
between buying a sailboat or a race horse. I sold him my boat anyhow, but
that's another story).

I think this explains why, in my town, there are always quite a few 2 - 6
month old Porsches on the market. 1) Rich guy buys new 911 because someone
told him that they're cool. 2) rich guy discovers that his Porsche is noisy,
hard riding, and cramped. 3) Rich guy trades in the 911 for an MBZ SL.

The pleasure I derive from my '87 Cabriolet cannot be measured on the skid
pad or at the stop-light drag race. It comes from knowing that I have the
privilege and good fortune to own one of the finest examples automotive
craftmanship ever produced. I changed my mind... get the Porsche! : )

 Ah, but the Porsche IS a great dragster. It just may not be the BEST

In my book, it _is_ a great "dragster" (I haven't been beaten yet :-) ),
but be very careful with the red-light starts - there are other people

Actually I've had the opposite experience here in Denmark. I've been 
stopped 3 times now going about 40% too fast on freeways (the only 
place I drive fast) and all three times the cops just said "What a nice
car! How fast can it go? Don't go so fast in the future!" and let me
go. But then again, I think they are tired of people going too fast
in their Toyota's that werent build to go fast...

I can only second this. It's a _great_ place to really learn to use your
car and control it in extreme situations.

This happened to my car also (86' 944). I had 4 dents caused by the lift.
I showed it to the shop and though they didn't deny it, they didn't offer 
to do anything about it either but sent me to one of their buddy's bodyshop.
Instead I had my insurance company look at it. It turns out that these shops 
buy insurance to cover cases like this. The shop ended up paying for any 
deductibles and I paid nothing and had it fixed at a bodyshop of my choice.
 
BTW, for those in Vancouver BC, the shop that did the damage is:

Mike:

Is it necessary for you to attack the views of others when expressing your
own?  The relevance of your own experience as an obviously proud  owner of a
76 Euro 911 is diminished by the immaturity of your closing comments.

Certainly there's room for give and take opposing views on this forum.
If the purchase of a Porsche from their earliest introduction was a
practical, logical, cost-effective, and "popular"  decision rather than an
emotional one, we'd all be driving only 1951 Chevrolet Fleetlines with our
latest purchase being a 94 Ford Taurus.

If it's an obsession for the marque, I'm sure many would be thrilled to offer

This just plain sucks (pardon my language) all around.  I've worked in the
dealership retail side for about10 years, selling or servicing.  Tim, I feel
like this is a reflection on everyone in my industry.  Any competent shop
anticipates some errors and damage, we budget for it, sometimes we even feel
that we got screwed by a liberal application of 'goodwill'.  But the reason
for applying 'goodwill' is to earn your continued patronage.

The Better Business Bureau is a joke because no one check with them before
using a business.  Goodyear may have a system for resolving the dispute, but
I doubt it.  I believe you'll have to sue them, and I wish you the best of
luck (don't forget punative damages).

Perry is quite correct that a Porsche shop can make similar mistakes, but
they're much more likely to try to retain you as a customer and accept the
repair as their own, or negotiate a settlement.

According to the manufacturer. The things apparently do work.  Front spoilers
on most cars are effective at around 30 mph, the rear won't really make a

In a past life I've sold both the Porsche and the Dodge Stealth (a rebadged
Mitsu).  Before you make any decision, drive the two cars, better, drive two
used cars.  The mitsu is very heavy and feels it (the RT is 3200+ lbs in
Front Wheel Drive form, 3800+ if you want to get all that power down).  But
the eye opener is after 15,000 miles, the mitsu body just plain get loose.  I
have a great deal of respect for japanese 'bang for the buck', but if you're
willing to trade new japanese for slightly used 911, go for it.  The 87 - 89
Carrera is probaby the best of the breed, enjoying the G50 trans and
hydraulically actuated clutch (there's high-tech), plenty of power, and a
blast to drive. At about 100 mph, the mitsu starts to feel light in front,
and it certainly does not brake as well (I'm not talking statistics, but
feel). 
Buy what you will, but a test drive in a used mitsu will truly open your eyes
to the quality of the product.

Skater,

Stan and Michael have spoken words of great wisdom.  I have only two nits to
pick with what's already been said, and one new thing to consider.  Michael 
said:
 
> Styling: Lot's of sexy cars on the sales lots these days. The thirty-year old

That's truly the classic YMMV case!  I personally have found the 911 styling
to be timeless, and have been hopelessly smitten since the first one I saw,
on the streets of Wiesbaden, in November 1964 (I'm sure it was a 901, but
that's a lot of years, so...)

> Quality: BMW, MBZ, and even Honda come out on top in this category. But

This is another YMMV.  I've owned a couple of MBZs, and while both were
high quality cars, I've *never* seen fit *or* finish superior to my cab.

Finally, when you drive a 911, you have the satisfaction of knowing you are
driving one of a very select breed.  Along with one Ferrari or another, the
911 is the one car that will be on every knowledgable enthusiast's list of
the top ten sports cars ever made.  That's definitely a FWIW issue; which,
in the final analysis, is what the whole business of buying a sports car is
*all* about...

I'm sorry, but in my eyes, the Carrera is not a loser when compared to a
3000GT/300ZX/et al.  As far as handling goes, if you are a good enough
driver to discern (and fret) over the small differences in skidpad
ratings, etc., then more power to you.  For 95% of drivers out there,
the Carrera is more than capable.  IMHO, the "viperous" oversteering
characteristics of the 911 is somewhat of an urban legend nowadays -
it's not really that bad.  As for the power - something to consider is
the weight of the cars.  I don't have the numbers handy but I bet the 
911 is lighter than most of its competitors - that means alot.  Styling?
Subjective category.  Quality?  Look at 10 or even 20 year old 911s.
They seem to be holding up much better than - well just about every-
thing else.  Sounds like quality to me.  Practicality?  I driven 3000GTs,
etc.  Practicality is relative (don't give me no steenking cup holders!).
Ownership costs?  Factor in resale value and the whole picture changes.

Sorry for the line-by-line rebuttal, but I found it hard to believe these
T*d-like statements came from the owner of an '87 Carrera!  Maybe I'm
a glutton for punishment, but I'd pick the pcar over anything else in the
same price range.

Hi, Sam.
 
The best car marque book ever written is about Porsches. Get Karl
Ludvigsen's "Excellence was Expected", about $85 I think, and well over 800
pages of carefully researched history. It is the standard by which all other
car histories are judged. It was written in 1978, I think, and was never
updated, but it has never been beaten either as a general history.
 
There is a new 911 history book coming out this spring, with less of the
corporate history and more specific 911 history. "Porsche 911: Forever
Young" by Tobias Aichele. Look for it around April. It is up to date up to
the 1995 Carrera 4. and Tiptronic S transmission. About 400 pages.
 
Brett Johnson's "911 Restorer's Guide to Authenticity" covers some of the
appearance differences between models and years, but not the engineering and
mechanical stuff.
 
There are other good books out there, but most were written in the late 70s
and are threfore dated. Paul Frere's "Porsche 911" is a nuts and bolts
development history. Juergen Barth's "Porsche Book" has a few mistakes but
is a rough year-by-year guide to model differences.
 
The best and just about only book on how to tweak the thing once you have it
is "The 911 Performance Handbook" by Bruce Anderson.

Subject: Chips for '86 928S

Hi,
I'm looking for some net wisdom on the subject of installing modified
ignition/fuel control chips on an '86 928S.  I am aware that there are
dramatic increases in power on turbos such as the 951 when chips are
used, but my understanding is that that effect is made primarily
through increase in the amount of boost and RPMs allowed by the
modified DME.  The '86 928S is not amenable to boost changes, so
how much improvement can be expected by just remapping the fuel/
ignition profiles?
Does anyone have any practical experience with chip modifications
on this engine?  Also, how do the Triad chips advertised in PANO
compare with the more common chips from Autothority?  The Triad
chips are selling for about 1/3rd the cost of the Autothority
chips.
Thanks for any information you may be able to give me.

Peter,
	The way I always understood it (please correct me if I am 
wrong), carbon is a problem because it can get hot enough to glow and 
act like a glow plug causing the air/fuel mixture to ignite earlier than 
it should. This can cause knock and subsequent damage. I agree, however, 
that most modern engines have little problem running at low revs, in 
this sense, because of the EFI's efficient control of the air/fuel 
mixture such that it burns more thoroughly, even at low revs. I do agree 
with others about the bearing wear at lower revs though (due to the 
pressures of combustion at slow revs). I know that it is certain death 
to run my Cosworth engine at low revs in my 7. It also seemed to me that 
at the factory they told us not to run around in too high a gear with 
the 911(?)

Hi,

As to what car to buy? Since you're very concerned with acc. I've included
the test-values of a couple of the cars as well as other cars that might
be interesting. I know the 993 and a (almost) new 911C2 is quite expensive,
but it's interesting to compare these, since a few people claims the
Porsche's are the slowest in the flock, which they (in my experience)
definately is _not_. (I couldn't find the values for a stock 3.2, sorry)

The testvalues below are taken from the German magazine 'Auto, Motor und
Sport' which is the one of the most esteemed magazines in europe. (I don't
know if the BMW M3 has hit the american beaches)

All speed is measures in km/h. Weight is kg and measured in test. Price is
thousand DM and was the price, when the car was tested (without options).

(For all you americans with weird units :-) :

Compare this to for instance my 911 3.2. It's got 245HP and weighs
1250 kg. This means I have 5.1 Kg/HP - which is marginally less than a 
993, but better than a 911C2. (Agreed my car is a bit modified, but not 
much. It it, naturally, a euro Carrera (no cats))

In europe the 300XZ, 3000GT and RX-7 is normally not even compared with
the 911, but with the 968 where the performance is just about equal, 
with the 968 being a bit behind. Only the Toyota Supra is being compared
to the 911's...

I've tried a dragging against both a GT3000 and a 300ZX - none of them 
could keep up. I was about 40-50 meters in front of them when I hit 180 km/h.

On track I've also tried dragging a 911C2 and I was faster than that 

one too. Only marginally, but enough to pass him on a long straight. I won't 
begin to compare driving around the corners, since my 911 has a non-stock setup
(equally fast as a C2 with my narrow-body 3.2 targa).

I haven't tried driving against any of the other cars on track, so I will
not say anything about this..

Another thing is that it's easier (and _much_ cheaper) making a
turbo-charged car go faster. You can easily modify it by turning
up the boost preassure (Well, not all _that_ simple if you want it to
last, but you get the picture).

I'd strongly recommend trying to go for a spin in the cars you're
considering and letting the car "speak" to you.

About the price: Yes, the 911 is expensive. Yes, it's expensive
to maintain. However you also have a better resale value of the
car. The japanese metal depreciates _very_ quickly. I'm using
mine as an every day driver too, but it _is_ at a high cost.

I think that if you want better comfort, more gadgets and a newer
look (that will be outdated in 3 years), get a new japanese car.

But if you like Porsches: There can be only one...

I recently purchased a 1984 944.  The car has been working really well
 except for one problem.  Whenever I drive the car in the rain the floor
 becomes wet.  The passenger side is is far worse then the driver side 
and the front is worse then the back.  I have assumed since the floor 
becomes wet only when the car is driven, that the water is being splashed 
up from underneath.  Upon investigating the underbody, I saw only one 
obvious opening... but it looked suspiciously like a drainage hole.  
The hole is behind the front wheel and a bit towards the middle of the 
car.  Has anyone out there had a similar problem?  I am inclined to try 
blocking the hole, but it looks like it was placed there on purpose... 

 Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanx to all who responded to my message on my decision process. I know my
best bet is probably sticking with a newer car, but I know if I buy a
Japanese car I'll hate myself everytime I see a 911 on the road. The most
disconcerting thing I heard was that the Porsche is not a great "dragster".
Since this will be my fist real sports car, I wanted something to play with
during my stoplight to stoplight hops. I don't plan on racing motorcycles,
but I'd like to give the domestics (Z28's,Trans Ams, Vettes?) a run for their
money. Oh well, I guess I'll just hope for a spiritual revelation..

This is a Bad Idea in all cases. Any Porsche looks to most cops like
it has "TICKET ME" printed on the back window. It also is a sign of 
either a lack of maturity or a lack of knowledge. I'll assume it's a 
lack of knowledge, and offer something for you to think about:

True "sports cars" are all originally of European design. They were
designed around *road racing*, not drag racing, which is a purely American 
phenomenon. In road racing, where originally the goal was to cover some 
amazingly twisty chunk of European roadway, often with great elevation 
changes, between two places, you need a *BALANCED* car -- great handling, 
good power to weight ratio, acceptible acceleration, great high speed
stability. *THAT* is what the 911 has.

American "muscle cars" are designed for something completely different --
raw straight line acceleration. I once had a '73 Mustang with the '70 
Ford NASCAR SOHC 428 engine, making about 650 HP at the rear wheels as 
I was running it then. *UNBELIEVABLE* acceleration. But God help you if 
you needed to turn while underway, or for that matter STOP suddenly. 

As to your "need for speed" deal, I highly suggest that you join the PCA
and take your new 911 to autocross and drivers' education (learning to
drive at speed on race tracks) events, where you can get much more 
satisfation that you can possibly imagine. And no tickets.

Unfortunately, you're probably out of luck unless you can get someone who saw

After you've complained to the Manager, I'd suggest you ask (or call
information) for the 800- Goodyear Customer  Relations number.  It probably
won't produce results, but at least you can do some "venting" with them about
their dealer.

Porsche dealers, even though they should know the car, can do the same thing.
 Although you have to learn the hard way, on routine things like leakers, I
remove the tire/wheel and carry it in....but they can still mess up the alloy
rims on tire removal unless you watch them.  Most "general service" shops
like Goodyear don't like customers in the service bay.

Subject: Re: Decisions... Decisions

Skater,

Bart and Mike D. speak the truth. Issues like styling, quality, and resale
value are subjective. Even performance figures don't always present a clear
picture. I think the point I was making when I suggested that you not
purchase a Porsche was that the satisfaction of Porsche ownership comes from
more then the sum of  it's parts (or performance figures). It's a visceral
thing.

In your original post, you were attempting to quantify the merits of two nice
Japanese autos with those of a Porsche. Although it is difficult for me to
admit, I believe that the Porsche comes up short in many of the categories
that you mentioned. 

A little story: I have owned (and sold) several sailboats over the years.
Owning a sailboat is a lot like owning a Porsche (stay with me on this, it's
going somewhere, honest). When it comes time to sell my boat, occasionally an
interested party will tell me that he's undecided on whether to buy a
powerboat or a sailboat. In almost every case, I'll recommend that he
purchase a power boat. You see, sailing is a lot of work. But a sailboat
owner will sacrifice things like comfort, performance, and utility in order
to enjoy this specialized vessel in much the same way a Porsche owner will
likewise make a few sacrifices. If the buyer doesn't "get it" (the visceral
thing), he/she will be disappointed.  (Once a guy told me he couldn't decide
between buying a sailboat or a race horse. I sold him my boat anyhow, but
that's another story).

I think this explains why, in my town, there are always quite a few 2 - 6
month old Porsches on the market. 1) Rich guy buys new 911 because someone
told him that they're cool. 2) rich guy discovers that his Porsche is noisy,
hard riding, and cramped. 3) Rich guy trades in the 911 for an MBZ SL.

The pleasure I derive from my '87 Cabriolet cannot be measured on the skid
pad or at the stop-light drag race. It comes from knowing that I have the
privilege and good fortune to own one of the finest examples automotive
craftmanship ever produced. I changed my mind... get the Porsche! : )

In my book, it _is_ a great "dragster" (I haven't been beaten yet :-) ),
but be very careful with the red-light starts - there are other people

Actually I've had the opposite experience here in Denmark. I've been 
stopped 3 times now going about 40% too fast on freeways (the only 
place I drive fast) and all three times the cops just said "What a nice
car! How fast can it go? Don't go so fast in the future!" and let me
go. But then again, I think they are tired of people going too fast
in their Toyota's that werent build to go fast...

This happened to my car also (86' 944). I had 4 dents caused by the lift.
I showed it to the shop and though they didn't deny it, they didn't offer 
to do anything about it either but sent me to one of their buddy's bodyshop.
Instead I had my insurance company look at it. It turns out that these shops 
buy insurance to cover cases like this. The shop ended up paying for any 
deductibles and I paid nothing and had it fixed at a bodyshop of my choice.

Is it necessary for you to attack the views of others when expressing your

Certainly there's room for give and take opposing views on this forum.
If the purchase of a Porsche from their earliest introduction was a
practical, logical, cost-effective, and "popular"  decision rather than an
emotional one, we'd all be driving only 1951 Chevrolet Fleetlines with our
latest purchase being a 94 Ford Taurus.

If it's an obsession for the marque, I'm sure many would be thrilled to offer

Guys,

This just plain sucks (pardon my language) all around.  I've worked in the
dealership retail side for about10 years, selling or servicing.  Tim, I feel
like this is a reflection on everyone in my industry.  Any competent shop
anticipates some errors and damage, we budget for it, sometimes we even feel
that we got screwed by a liberal application of 'goodwill'.  But the reason
for applying 'goodwill' is to earn your continued patronage.

The Better Business Bureau is a joke because no one check with them before
using a business.  Goodyear may have a system for resolving the dispute, but
I doubt it.  I believe you'll have to sue them, and I wish you the best of
luck (don't forget punative damages).

Perry is quite correct that a Porsche shop can make similar mistakes, but
they're much more likely to try to retain you as a customer and accept the
repair as their own, or negotiate a settlement.

In a past life I've sold both the Porsche and the Dodge Stealth (a rebadged
Mitsu).  Before you make any decision, drive the two cars, better, drive two
used cars.  The mitsu is very heavy and feels it (the RT is 3200+ lbs in
Front Wheel Drive form, 3800+ if you want to get all that power down).  But
the eye opener is after 15,000 miles, the mitsu body just plain get loose.  I
have a great deal of respect for japanese 'bang for the buck', but if you're
willing to trade new japanese for slightly used 911, go for it.  The 87 - 89
Carrera is probaby the best of the breed, enjoying the G50 trans and
hydraulically actuated clutch (there's high-tech), plenty of power, and a
blast to drive. At about 100 mph, the mitsu starts to feel light in front,
and it certainly does not brake as well (I'm not talking statistics, but
feel). 
Buy what you will, but a test drive in a used mitsu will truly open your eyes
to the quality of the product.

	During the time I had worker at a Porsche dealer one of the things
I lerned was that 944s (and 924s as well) could only be properly placed on
an asymetrical type lift by using the lift extentions that raise the jack
pad hight.  In order to accomplish this the car must be jacked up slightly
with a floor jack before the lift's arms could be swung under the car. 
Otherwise the lifts arms will contact the rockers before the pads can get
to the jack points.  Unfortunately, many shop are either ingnorant to this
or too lazy.  Yes, Porsche dealers included. 
  You may want to point this out to the service manager or whoever is in
charge before the work is done on your car.

This is the bit I'm not sure about. Why do you have to (a) put the car
into neutral and (b) release the clutch? Why not just depress the clutch
at this point ...

	Please note that this is a request for enlightenment and is not a

the difference between "clutch depressed" and "car in neutral" and the
different effects which these two things (both of which remove the
transmission from the driven wheels) affect the cars performance.

15w30 castrol (soon to be 5w30 for winter).  When I started the car 
this am the oil pressure pegged at above 5.  Backed the car up about
20 feet then idled for about 2 minutes - oil pressure down to 4 bar.
Oil pressure continues to drop as the oil warms.  Arriving at work
10 mins later the oil temp is 1/2 way to the first hash mark and the
pressure is 1 bar at idle, and with rpm to 5 bar near redline.  I have
noticed that above idle the oil pressure is a little higher than
before I put on the tensioners - ~1 bar more at redline.  BTW, I run
with my oil level about 2/3 of the cockpit gauge when it's warmed up etc.

I think that the problem here is that most people think that
the clutch is the only discontinuity in a power train, however
the clutch, input and output of a transmission are all very 
seperate beasties. People tend to regard the transmission 
as an single thing rather than several systems with dual feedback
loops that relate the input and output sides in strong and weak senses.

Essentially the synchros in a transmission transmit "information" in the
form of power that syncronises the rotational speed of the input and
output sides of the transmission, two distinct sub-systems, that
have the ability to be strongly linked and weakly linked. All this
is independent of the clutch. The clutch only exists because 
internal combustion engines are crap at producing torque at
low (zero) revs. If internal combustion engines had the same power
characteristics as electric motors (max torque available at zero
RPM!), we could dispense with clutches completely. As it is the
clutch is just there to stop the engine stalling when you start off,
everything else it does is just a reflection of how inconvenient 
a clutch is, and how inadequate the ubiquitous internal combustion engine is
for road transport applications.

Consider the following model.

When the clutch is out (engaged) and the car is in neutral,
the engine is spinning the input side of the transmission.

When the clutch is in (disengaged), the engine spins the clutch plate
but it is not engaged with the transmission or the clutch.

This means that when you blip the throttle with the clutch
out and the engine in neutral, you are spinning up the input 
side of the transmission, this means that you can match
the rotational speed of the power train with the output
side of the transmission which has a direct connection to
the rear wheels. The only reason you can spin up the
input side of the transmission is because the input is not meshed with
the output because you are in neutral. The gear selector directly
meshes the imput and output halves of the transmission, when meshed
the input and output rotation speed is exactly equal. The synchros
indirectly match the rotational speed of the input and output
sides, thus when you need to engage the input and output sides,
they magically happen to be rotating at the same speed! This is
what I mean by strong and weak linkage between the input and output
side of a transmission.

The syncros bleed power across the input and output elements of
the transmission and spin up the input side automatically in order 
match the input and output rotational speed of the transmission. You might
get the impression that you are matching the engine speed with
the rotational speed of the road wheels when for instance you
change down from 5th to 4th, This is not directly true, what you are actually 
doing is matching the engine speed with the rotational speed of the input 
side of the transmission, because the syncros have spun up the input side
to match the rotational speed of the output side and thus the road wheels.

If this did not happen, you would need to double de-clutch. This means
that the input side of the transmission has to be matched with the output
side before a gear is selected. This can only be done in neutral
with the clutch out so that the engine is driving the input side of the 
transmission. Because the input and output are not meshed, there is
no strong linkage between them, and because there are no synchros,
then it is up to the intrepid motorist to perform the task of
synchronising the input and ouput sides before a gear can 
be selected.

Before someone figured out how to engineer input-output syncromesh,
all gearboxes required double de-clutching. Porsche were one of the
first manufacturers to come up with a workable syncromesh, on the
356 I think. 

The reason why people double de-clutch on a syncromesh tranmission
is to save wear on the synchros. I know that it is common for
the synchros to wear out quite fast on pre G50 transmission
911 (915 transmission), hence the number of "why is my pre-87 911
impossible to get into first or second unless stationary" posts.
The G50 is a tougher beast, but I don't know if the synchros wear out
before the rest of the transmission or not.

You might notice in your 911 owners manual it suggests that in
very cold weather that you should depress the clutch when starting from
cold. This means that the starter does not have to drive the input side of
the transmission in cold, sticky, viscous oil, and thus does less work.
It also indicates that when the clutch is engaged that the input side of the
tranmission is active.

Further, you might have noticed that it is difficult to engage
reverse while moving forwards. Well, there is no syncro for reverse
because sane people do not what to go directly from forwards to 
backwards without stopping in between. I suspect that if you did
want to, double de-clutching might do the trick. It is a matter
of academic interest to know whether anyone on the list has 
ever performed this experiment and could enlighten us with the
results of shifting into reverse at 150 MPH and dumping the clutch.
If the momentum of the vehicle was sufficient, and your clutch was very good, 
it might be possible for the engine to be driven backwards for a very brief 
instant, before the whole power train self destructed and you had a spectacular
accident. Perhaps we could get T*d to check this one out for us, but
then again he probably has a synchromesh on reverse on his 911 and therefore
does not need to double de-clutch to change into reverse at 150 MPH, and thus
is unable to prove the basis of my hypothesis, but merely the outcome.

Please note that this is a conceptual model rather than an engineering
one, so I can't promise that it matches the real world so no flames please.
I am an econmomist and computer person and would not recogise a G50
gearbox or synchro if you hit me on the head with it (ouch!) However if you are 
talking about input/output models and finite state machines you are talking
my language.

I hope that this explodes the black box of the 911 transmission
literally in the case of the "flat out in 5th, shift into reverse"
scenario, and figuratively as well.

Subject: Winter Tires/C4s

My everyday driver is a Subaru SVX; limited as the comparison is, there are
aspects comparable to a C4 and I'm hoping that tire selection is one of
them.  While my 944 sleeps the SVX must venture out in the elements and I've
been less than happy with the Potensa's that came with the car.

What winter/wet/good-dry-too tires are recommended now?  I've put BFG Comp
T/As on front wheel cars and have been pleased.

Second, related question:  The SVX has 225/50-16s on now and I'm thinking
about going to 205/55-16s to give a narrower tread for cutting through the
snow.  The resulting diameter difference is only about a hundredth of an
inch (if my figuring is right)!  Is there any down side to this strategy?

Thanks!

For car washing purposes the the spoiler is great - its
the only flat place on the car.  I put my wax can,
Windex bottle, towel, chamios, etc  on it.

As far as a quick visual check for spoiler originality,
I believe factory installed/original always had the louvers
painted black - not body color.  I.e. a spoiler with body
colored louvers is probably not original.

Perhaps test driving each might make the decision easier.  Personally
I think the that what the _car_ does is not as important as what the car 
_does for you_.    My GTI gives me pleasure in ways a Camry V6 never 
would - even if the Camry is faster.  My 911 gives me pleasure even
when I'm just washing it (what other car has curves like that?).
As far as the Mitsu 3000 GT VR4, one might consider that it weighs 
3900 pounds - over 1000 more than a 911.

Rolando:
	The water bottle comes out by doing 4 or 5 screws. Some of these
are accessible from the bottom. I think I had to loosen the headlight motor
to let the bottle drop. It comes out from the bottom. 

I also had a leak in mine. I used a Dremel tool to actually make the leak
larger (deeper). If you try to patch it by just applying something over
it, it will leak since they usually crack and the goo will not stick to
the outside of the bottle. I actually went through the side of the bottle.

I made the crack into an elongated hole and filled it with RTV silicone
sealer. Its been about 3 months with no leaks! Make sure to realign your
headligth mechanism. I think I had to remove the HL motor. Like I said,
its been like 3 months...

Hope this helps.

By matching revs with it. It's the moment that you actually engage
the clutch, in the gear you want to be in, that it matters. The part
of the drivetrain between the fan pulley and the transmission input
shaft (plus whatever additional gears and shafts are connected & spinning
when the trans is in neutral and the clutch engaged) gets spun up to match
the revs of the part of the drivetrain that connects to the wheels. So when
you finally do engage the clutch with the desired gear engaged, there isn't
a mismatch to be absorbed.

This does not match revs between the clutch output shaft (transmission
input shaft, clutch friction disks, etc) and everything else. Sure you can
match revs without double-clutching, but when you do double-clutch you have
already matched revs.

The one situation where you can (and should) double (de)clutch into 
reverse is when your car is already rolling backwards and you want to be 
able to apply more rearward power.  In this situation, the output gears 
which mesh with the input side when 'reverse' is selected are turning in 
the correct direction.

Actually, Porsche AG preferred does normally pay a dividend, though it hasn't
for the past two years. However, because of nonpayment, preferred
shareholders have received voting rights. Porsche may "cure" the situation by

Subject: Seat Question

Hi All-

Is it possible that early and late 911 seats are not 
interchangeable, at lesat not easily?  Here's the situation.

The '72 911 I'm restoring has what I think are called Low-
Back
seats, made by Recaro.  The parts manual indicates that 
there were two seat types available for the '72, my Low-
Backs, and a "Sport" model.  My seats are more-or-less like 
a plush chair rather than like a bucket.

My seats need to be recovered.  However, I have an 
opportunity to buy two leather seats from an '84 911, in 
immaculate condition.  These are more bucket-like.  But the 
distance between the rails (i.e., the width) on my seats is 
about 18", while the newer seats have rail mounting bolt 
holes that are 16" apart. Thus the newer seats are narrower 
by about 2".  The newer seats also appear to be lower.

Does anyone know if there are adapters available?  Or if it's 
even worth considering buying or fashioning an adapter?

Thanks.  And Happy New Year to Everyone!

Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/Porschephiles/home.html.
The FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions?  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts..."

     In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split.

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

I want to join the Porsche Club of America; what do I have to do?

     The Club affiliates you with a local region based on where your
ZIP code falls on their territory map.  You *CAN* request to join a
specific region, and you can specify an affilate region or dual
membership in another region.  The local regions put on many different
events, some social, some educational, some driving or compeition
oriented.  The annual gathering of the whole membership, the Porsche
Parade, features competition for the national championships in many
events, seminars, a GREAT goodie store, and one of the most fun weeks
you'll experience.

     To join, you need to have a Porsche VIN number and be able to claim 
you're an owner, a co-owner, or hold a lease on a Porsche.  That may
seem restrictive, particularly if you want to join the club to get
access to Panorama, the club magazine, for purposes of FINDING a car...
In such case, it's suggested that you purchase a modest fraction of a
friend's car for say $5 or so, hence becoming a co-owner.  Just don't
tell them you did that or where you got the idea...

     Once you have a VIN number, there are four ways to join:

     1) Send a letter to the national office saying that you want to 
join, with your name, address, car info and a check for $36 to:

	Porsche Club of Americia.
	P.O. Box 10402
	Alexandria VA 22310

     2) Call them up at +1 703 922-9300, roughly between 9:00 to 5:00
EST (GMT - 6).  If you have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number
handy, you can do it over the phone.  (Otherwise, they'll send you an
application which you can mail in with your check.)  This is the FASTEST
way, and if you need to be a member *RIGHT NOW* to go to an event that
is members only, this is your best bet.  Don't count on using this
method the week of or before Parade...

     3) find someone active in your local region.  *MANY* of the regions
are represented on the Porschephiles list, so that's a good place to
start.  Once you have found someone, get them to put you in touch with
the local region membership chair, they can give you the form, and off 
you go.

     4) National membership chair Nann Weissenberger is also on the
list, and is reachable via e-mail at "nannw@aol.com".  She'd be more 
than happy to help you out.

=======================================================================

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

=======================================================================

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:
Information about water-cooled cars is lacking; those with favorites
should submit them to one of the names at the end of this FAQ.)

Should I use an oil additive in my Porsche engine?

     This is Stan's response:  "Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil.  Or as Bruce 
Anderson commented about something else, "a cash flow device."  Slick-50
is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case.  Guess what we 
all have, eh?  There is a bit of info on it via anonymous FTP in tta.com
in /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo.  Additionally, many of these additives 
use teflon.  DuPont (the inventors of Teflon) have stated categorically 
that teflon is useless in such applications."
 
=======================================================================

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other renowned Porsche people) here?
 
Yes. There are many luminaries in the Porsche world on this list.  If
something is relevant to them, they'll typically respond to you
privately.  Their participation is greatly valued, so respect their
privacy and don't try to draw them out in the open.  If they want to 
say something to the list as a whole, they'll do so.

Hi all

Couple of suggestions.  Have your machinist pull the oil galley plugs (there 
are four or five) and tap the galley ways to accept screw-in plugs.  I had
an oil galley plug pop out (hence the rebuild...very messy and a lousy way to
start one's day).  Definitely check for cracks in the case around the oil
strainer bolt hole.  These are caused by overtorquing the bolt and can, if
severe, restrict flow to the oil pump.  You probably will need to have misc.
cracks in the head repaired; also check and replace, if necessary, any of the
valves.  The valves in mine had been bead blasted sometime in the past and
were very rough.  You might want to consider having the rotating masses
balanced.  It added $175 to my rebuild costs and seemed like a good idea.

Shameless Plug (ignore if you don't live near Portland, Oregon):

If you live near (or in) Portland, Oregon consider using Dan Hall's
Automotive Machine Shop (503) 289-5015.  They do good work, price it
reasonably, and are
experienced with Porsche and VW air-cooled powerplants and their various
idiosyncrasies.  Dan and his crew also have some experience building race
engines, but I don't know to what extent.  While I was asking around for
recommended machine shops in the area, Dan's name kept coming up: seems he's
made a bunch of customers happy around here.

Yeah the seat addapters are availble but kind of expensive. (Some places want
$75+ per side...) When I put '77 seats in my '67 i made my own and they work
just fine. I took my old seats out, got apeice of steel that was about an
1/8" thick, had it cut to the proper sizes and lined up my holes on my car
and then lined up the holes in the seats and they fit with a small amount of
filing.

It took about 2 hours after getting the metal.

Subject: Need quiet A-arm bushings for 911SC

Hello all:

I'm looking for a source of non-squeaking A-arm bushings for my '81 911SC.

I removed the four original rubber bushings from the A-arms and I replaced
them with Weltmeister bushings that I bought a couple years ago.  I was
about to install the A-arms back onto to my 911 when I heard that
Weltmeister bushings squeak like crazy.  I don't want to listen to
squeaking bushings and I'm not really that interested in the handling
benefits that Weltmeister bushings offer.  Unfortunately, I destroyed one
of my original rubber bushings upon removal, so I cannot reinstall the
original rubber bushings.  Does anyone know where to purchase the original
rubber bushings?  Apparently you cannot purchase the rubber bushings
separately from Porsche, instead you must purchase the A-arms with rubber
bushings already installed.

Alternatively, is there a source for non-squeaking performance bushings?

Thanks for your help,

Subject: RE: Farting and hesitation


Peter Diffey wrote about hesitation and mild backfire in his watercooler 
in very cold weather.

This can be caused by:

A small amount of water from condensation in the fuel. This is passed and 
cannot burn, causing some misfire or hesitation.

A more likely cause is condensation in the distributor cap, turning to 
steam as operating temperature is reached. It can also be caused by some
coolant being forced out a hose just prior to the thermostat opening (the
point where steam pressure in the cooling system is highest). If you 
service the cap and rotor, be sure to replace the dust cover under the 
rotor.

Subject: Aux air reg access

Hey P-filers

I have an '83 SC engine in my '73T. I wish to test the auxiliary 
air regulator, and possibly the aux. air valve. I have the Haynes
manual and the '72-'83 manuals on fiche and their instructions
consist of three steps (remove electric wires, remove breather
lines, remove attaching bolts) which would be easy if I could
'morph' my hands underneath the air box. My question: do I need 
to remove the air box to access these components, if so, how, as
I find no reference to airbox removal in either manual. If not,
how, as I was born without the 'conformal hand unit' option.

Thanks for any help. (BTW, I have the time to work on this since
the dealer does not have a replacement for my 'space shuttle brittle'
oil tank O-ring that leaked. Sooooo, I'm driving the battering ram
until Friday. At least.)

If memory serves me correct, there were two designations for

Subject: RE: Porsche AG Stock


>Interesting stuff, this Porsche AG stock -- it offers no voting rights,
>it pays no dividends.

I thought that it did pay dividends.  There was news during the last
few years that with the company's poor financial performance, they
might not pay a dividend, and that by failing to pay one, there was a
kicker which gave normally non-voting shares a vote.  I may have
this all wrong.

The interesting thing to me has been not the voting rights or dividend.
I realistically have no voting rights for any company's stock I do in fact
own, although the invitations to their annual meetings in East Dogleg
are always appreciated.  And lots of companies do not pay a dividend.
No, what is interesting is that they have such a high share price, which
effectively keeps small players out of the stock.  In the US, at least,
companies with share prices over $50 to $100 will typically split the
shares so that individual investors can buy them in "round lots," ie,
100-share chunks.  Perhaps things are different in the BRD.

Subject: my car doesn't love me

    OK, first I'm going to apologize because I'm not subscribed to the
list anymore (I'm on vacation) but I'm still working on my 914 (big
shock) so if you could reply by email I'd appreciate it.

    Argh.. where to begin?  I got the car home, loved the way it always
started right up, but the nonfunctional throttle cable was peeving me. 
So I ripped the old one out (using a hand winch - that little steel tube
was rusted solid!) and tried to insert the new one.  No go.  Apparently
pulling the old one out didn't clean out the tube enough to let the new
one slide in.  Here's how I fixed it...  I got a 4' long piece of steel
rod, put a little blob of weld on the end, and hammered it flat to look
like a little spade-type drill bit.   Chucked it in a power drill and
ran it through from underneath the car (sprayed liberally with WD-40
first.)  clip 'n' save, if any of you guys have the same problem.  Of
course, it took me a week of screwing around to come up with this
solution, that was just the method that worked. ;)
    Oh, yeah, and the fuel line snapped (?) as did the battery ground
cable (?) at the exact same time... get the feeling I'm unlucky?  And
the first time I took it out on the road, the hood came unlatched at
about 30 MPH, so I've got a little pounding to do on the cowl. :(
    Well, here are the questions.. I've been poking through the engine,
and I've come to the realization that the vacuum hoses are all screwed
up.  Someone cut off one of the lines to the charcoal canister and
hooked up a line from the blower box to the crankcase (among other
things.)  I guess that would explain why my spark plugs are all wet. 
Can anyone point me to a good diagram for how these things are really
supposed to go?    I guess I should have mentioned that the car is a '71
with stock D-jet.
    Also, over break, I tried to put the top on for the first time and I
can't get the damn thing on.  The back latches just don't seem to match
up.  The part on the top has a hard thing about 1" long, while the part
on the body looks like there's a seat for a similar part, only it should
be about 3/8" long.  Were there two different designs for the top
latches (and I've got a different top than came with my car?)  What to
do?  I should point out that my car does "flex" a little, as it is in
need of some patching on the rockers, so it is a possibility that I just
had it misaligned.  Howevver, this is the only way that it looks like it
would go on, so if a few 914 owners could go look at your car and tell
me what your rear top latches look like, I'd appreciate it.
    Finally, is there any performance to be gained from dumping my
oil-bath air cleaner for a paper-element one?  Or is it just a
convenience thing?

    Thanks in advance,

Nate

PS-  I don't know when I'll be on again, so don't be offended if I don't
reply to anyone.

Squeal, yes, "spin", no. Good tires develop maximum traction at a 5-15% slip
rate (the exact rate depends on both the tire and the surface in question).
This means that the drive wheels should be rotating 5% to 15% faster than they
would if they were simply rolling at the same speed as the car. For a car with
lots of extra power, you have to modulate the gas pedal, rolling on steadily
to maintain that "just complaining" level of tire slip as the revs and speed 
mount up. For cars that don't have that kind of power, the launch can still
be improved (at considerable cost in clutch life) by starting out at peak
torque revs and modulating the clutch to maintain the desired slip rate,
and then the gas pedal if you still have enough torque to bother once the
clutch is fully engaged.

       Electromotive's phone number is (703)378-2444. The manual is available
  for $15, and the units and parts are still available. Twin-plug setups
  start at about $1000 for the HPV-1, and run more if you want MAP sensing
  to retard the ignition upon boost.  The HPV-3b runs about $300 more but
  allows you to PC program in variable advance/retard across vacuum/boost.
       If you don't already have the optional MAP sensor and control box
  you probably should get it. They support MAP sensors up to 2 bars boost,
  the can for the HPV-1 lets you dial in what retard at which load/boost.
       I don't have an HPV-x but have heard it made all the difference on
  another gentlemans twin-distributored Ferrari 308. I'm sure its not as
  sophisticated as Motronic but it does let you fire 2 plugs and seems a whole
  lot more accurate than weights and springs on a distributor (and didn't
  that year 930 not have DME yet ? Or any kind of computer-controlled 
  ignition ?)

Porsching by Chris Welty, Hudson-Champlain Region

Subtitle: "When you wish upon a start, Part I"

When You Wish Upon a Star - Part I

Standing in an open field on a clear summer evening, I watched the
stars materialize in the darkening sky.  The first to become visible
was Vega, a corner of the popular summer triangle. At that
moment I stretched out my arm and, aiming my finger at this point of
light, I chanted an ancient spell.  At the conclusion of the powerful
verse, the magic of the moment enveloping me in a soft breeze, I
uttered the words which would seal and direct the charm: I wish I
had a Porsche. A sudden clap of thunder and a blinding flash of
lightning told me that my skills as a necromancer had been sucessful
 Either that or I was embellishing the story too much.  Ah indeed,
the latter turned out to be the case, for standing there, before my
very eyes, there was no new car.  No shining example of Ferdinands
master craftsmen.  No turbo boxer six roaring in the starlight.
Nothing.  Not so much as a Chevy.  A small field mouse darted into a
clump of grass, and overhead a bat winged its way in silent pursuit of
a nocturnal insect. Somewhere a dog was barking.  Not that I could
hear it, but I figured somewhere a dog must have been barking  in
fact, I figured it was my neighbors dog, the damn thing never shuts
up.  I hung my head dejectedly, disappointed in my inadequacy.  I
stood there a moment more, then turned to leave.  But as I was
trudging back to the tent, cursing Jiminy Cricket under my breath, I
felt a faint twinge somewhere inside me.  Looking up, I could swear
that  for a moment  Vega quickly brightened, and somehow I knew
that one day, when the time was right, I would have the power to
complete that spell (and also that I would never use the word
inadequate to describe myself again).

Two years later I was watching Bambi on video when the phone rang.  My
old roomate, John, had just returned from California with a 911.  I
put the VCR on pause, not wanting to miss the part where Bambi does
Memphis, and began a series of eager questions.  What color?  What
year?  What kind?  What condition? Do the babes really line up for
rides?

Before I answer your questions, he began, in that tone that
either meant he was about to pose a hypothetical situation or coerce
me into making a promise.  I want you to promise me that you will
go to California this summer and buy a Porsche.

OK, OK.  I promise.  I dont usually put up this much of a fight.

Very good.  I have a yellow, 1973 T targa.  No rust, perfect,
and two blondes and a brunette. He went on. It sounded great, and I
was deeply envious.  The pause eventually turned off automatically on
the VCR and Bambi finished off Memphis and even got as far as
Nashville before I hung up, too dazed to see the films climax.

A Porsche.  Just the name sparks excitement in most people.  Women
love to be seen in them, and men just...well...love to be seen in
them.  But I  I was different.  I preferred to be seen under them.
Thats not to say I could do anything there, my Porsche mechanical
expertise went as far as knowing that the engine was in the back.  But
still I persisted in feeling that eventually I would buy an old one
and fix it up. Where I would obtain the knowledge to accomplish
this was still a mystery.  Nevertheless I dreamed.  Driving down Route
2 at 900 million miles an hour, my white 911 appearing blue to
everyone in front of me and red to everyone behind me (this property
of objects moving at high speeds, known as the "Doppler Effect",
doesn't appear to work for metalic colors), hugging the curves,
tearing up the straights, wasting Detroits best, and waving to cops
whos radar went off the scale.

Well, how can a person such as myself, who would never actually admit
in public to not knowing thing one about cars, afford to buy a
Porsche?  Enter Karl.  Our eyes didnt meet across a crowded room,
nor was it love at first sight, in fact it was in my office and I
thought he was no more than another brown nosing student.  But after
only a few moments I realized I had struck gold.  With little effort
on my part, I was able to subtly maneuver him into admitting not only
that he owned a 911, but that he had taken the whole car apart and put
it together again.  Scarcely able to believe my good fortune, and not
in the least bit aware of the mystical circumstances through which
this meeting was made inevitable, I phoned John and insisted he bring
his car up to test the knowledge of this German born meister mechanic.

No sooner had we brought the car into the student auto shop, Karl was
into and under it.  John and I merely stared in astonishment, trying
our best to follow and remember everything he did.  It was true, it
seemed he must have known everything there was to know about the
car. He taught us how to use the stethoscope, with which we determined
there were two loose valves, and then how to adjust them.  Many other
secrets of 911 maintenance were revealed to us that day, but in our
minds, the crowning achievement of the day was when, in response to
Johns broken speedometer, Karl produced a spare speedo cable and
even replaced it before our very eyes.  I could hardly believe anyone
could know a car so completely that he knew how the speedometer cable
was routed.  Odd how ones perspective changes, now Id scoff at
someone lacking such a trivial piece of knowledge, but at the time it
was amazing.

That day my decision was made.  It was clear that while Karl was
around I would have the opportunity to learn all the things I always
wanted to know, from someone who enjoyed teaching it.  Karl himself
had been convinced by looking at Johns car that California was the
place to go to buy a used 911.  When Karl sold his own 911 we
immediately made plans for the big trip.  John, in keeping with his
promise, agreed to come with us.  And so, driven by theurgical forces,
yet completely ignorant to the geas that had been cast upon us, we set
out to finish what a young sorcerer had started many years ago.

My '83 SC has the factory spoiler option, this is the "tea tray" style
rear from the >78 turbo (I think) plus a deeper front airdam.  For an
'87 Carerra I think the factory spoiler was more "whale tail" and lacked
the side fences that my later Turbo spoiler has. 

I've experimented both with and without it.  It's noticeable above 60
and a Major Asset above 90, or in any cross wind.  I think it must move
the center of pressure a little closer back to the center of gravity,
maybe even back behind the center of gravity (where it belongs!); anyway
the *feel* is just that the car is "arrowing" a little more elegantly thru
the air, and relying less on the tires to keep it pointed/going in a
straight line.  I *like* this feeling!

On the down side, this particular spoiler (factory with TUV-approved
rubber lip) adds about 50 lb 'way back and 'way up, exactly where you
don't want it.  A Major Hindrance when auto-xing or backroad blasting.
AND, though you say aesthetics aren't a concern, there is a major
effect on appearance; here in CA at least one goes from "just another
Porsche" to "boy racer", and out in the really wide open places one goes
from "CA sports car jerk" to "CA drug dealer" just by bolting 50 pounds
of fiberglass and rubber to your car.  

Conclusion?  The spoilers are *ON* the car, but I'm eyeing those carbon
fiber repros that have been popping up in Panorama...

hope this helps
 -Ed

p.s. maybe I'm a bit over-sensitive about the appearance thing... but
hey, at least *I'm* not thinkning about a VR3000, the Swiss Army Knife
of sports cars... yeccch!  Did we unload that guy to the T*d list?  I

Nate,

    How can I say this nicely?  You appear to have what I would refer to
as a "rolling wreck".

Clue #1:  The throttle cable was rusted in.
Clue #2:  The top no longer fits.
Clue #3:  Flexing at the rocker panels.

My guess would be that the frame tubes have rusted enough to start
bending.  I have heard of 914's where these tubes have broken, and
were fixed with 4x4's (lumber).  The top would not go on unless
the car was jacked up slightly at the center.  Parts Werks does sell
repair kits, but they aren't cheap to install.

Go back under the car and check for rust damage.  You shouldn't be
able to see any flexing while the car is sitting still.


Let's assume (hope) that I'm wrong, and go on to your other questions:

I don't know of a good diagram for the hoses.  From years of smog-checks,
the hoses on my car were real messed up.  Seems that all of them thought
they "knew" how they were supposed to go, and changed them.  Your best
bet would to be to find a car that hadn't been screwed with, and copy it.
Or get George to sell you a hose kit on the condition that he provide you
with the proper diagram.  What I did was to find someone who actually did
know what he was doing, and have him fix it.

Don't bother changing your air filter.  I put the paper filter back into
my car only because I have a 1973, and I wanted it stock.  (An evil
mechanic had replaced mine with an oil bath one.)  I didn't notice
any difference, and besides, I believe that I just bought the only one
left in North America.

you may be getting close to the problem, this morning I had another

the rev counter registered 0 revs .
As usual this happened twice in quick sucession, then no more symptoms

I could do with a new rotor I looked at the old one when i did the cam

I have the same car.  My understanding is that steel studs are

expansion rates of later style cylinder materials.  Ours are
cast iron.

How much oil does you car take?  My manual says 8.5 qts, but
this doesn't begin to get into the middle of the dipstick
range.  9.5 qts gets to the bottom of the range.  The
meter doesn't read yet, though (and it's calibration is
apparently for an 8.5 qt capacity).  I know the meter
works because I just rebuilt it, and when it the middle
of its position, the meter reads right.

I just rebuilt the car.  Haven't driven it yet, and
would like to get this straight before I do.

I've been checking the dipstick when warm, while
idling, as per the manual.

My CV joints came off by first removing the big circlip,
and then helping them along by hammering.  It was pretty
easy.

Subject: Electrical help needed. 

Hi,

The electrical gremlins have invaded my car and have taken over my turn
signal relay or something. A couple of weeks ago I drove my car ( '73 911) in
a light rain. As I came to a stop at a light, I heard an intermitent clicking
noise coming from the turn signal relay.  It wasn't bad at first, it just
clicked at 3 second intervals every now and then. Two weeks later it clicks
all the time. I went to Vertex  and Mike allowed me to try a new turn signal
relay. Unfortunately the problems persisted. Is it possible that he gave me a
defective switch even though it came out of the box?

I will list the symptoms.
1. The relay clicks all the time. It now also causes static in the  radio
reception everytime it clicks, but the tape player remains unaffected. 
2. I checked the adjustment of the hand brake warning switch. The switch is
well adjusted and works as it should. I should add that the warning light
comes on as usual.
3. The blinkers work properly except for the indicators on the RPM guage.
When I use the blinkers, the correct indicator (right or left) will come on
the guage and blink brightly twice and then both indicators will blink
simultaneously but at a lower intensity. The blinkers outside still work
correctly.
4. The emergency flashers work correctly.

 I checked every that I can think of but I haven't solved anything. If
anybody has any ideas I would love to hear them. Jim Pasha, I have read your
article in Excellence concerning electrical problems, but there wasn't
anything that applied to my particular situation. Do you have any ideas? If
anybody has any questions about my problem or if I left something out please
ask me.

As you can tell I'm rather desperate to fix this so any clues would be
greatly appreciated.

Subject: Re: 914 rust treatment


Dear Henry,

We always treat rust-colored metal, bare metal or freshly installed metal as
follows:

   1. Sand blast or wire brush all rust color from the metal. 
   2. Etch the metal with metal ready cleaner (POR-15 makes the product
also). This cleans any remaining rust from the metal and preps the surface
for the POR-15 rust paint.
   3. Spray or brush on POR-15 rust paint on the metal and let dry.
   4. Caulk seams (we use the excellent 3-M product).
   5. On surfaces prone to being hit by debris, we spray chipguard. This
product provides a rubbery semi-rough service so the road abuse will be
absorbed and not chip off the paint.
   6. Finally, we apply polyurethane paint in the factory color. This is the
latest and greatest paint available and provides great gloss and durability.

With each rusted area, it needs to be scraped clean off paint and rust and
sandblasted or wire brushed first. Only after this can we make a judgement as
to whether we should replace or repair the metal. The general consensus is
that if an ice pick will go through - replace it!

Dear Francis,

"Hunting" or an idle that fluxuates on its own is caused by leanness and
usually in the case of a 914, a vacuum leak. You may have a split vacuum boot
or an auxillary air valve sticking, but nevertheless, it is a minor problem.
Spraying carb cleaner (with spray wand attached) around all of the vacuum
boots and fittings when the problem occurs is the best way to begin
diagnosing your problem. Good luck!

Our rebuilt transaxles guaranteed for six months or six thousand miles are

Dear Keith,

Two thousand dollars for a 914 is a steal! We regularly pay that for a parts
car.

The most important place to spend your money first is to make the 914 body
perfect because without a body, you don't have a 914! Four thousand dollars
can instantly be absorbed in beginning to make the body sound and I am sure
that a two thousand dollar car needs help in this area!

The next area is the interior as these parts are hard to get and will be much
rarer in the future.

We assume your power plant is relatively sound and the car will run down the
road, so the only money that should be innitially spent here is for a
thorough maintenance/service (including such things as cable renewal and oil
leak repair).

Only then after the above are completed should you think about modifications.
Too many 914 enthusiasts have spent thousands modifying a 914 with a bad body
and ended up with a hopeless mess that they are buried in. Don't become one
of them!

Subject: Re: 914 Idle


Dear Dan,

We are very happy to see that you are reinstalling the fuel injection and
saving a 914!

Your problem is caused by a vacuum leak. Put your hand over the throttle body
when the car is idling high and then see where the extra air is leaking in.
Possibilities are:
    1. Misrouted vacuum line  Oil filler PCV to plentum, etc.
    2. Auxilliary air valve sticking open
    3. Decel valve leaking
    4. Vacuum boot ripped

Then spray carb cleaner (with spray wand attached) around all of the fittings
and see what varies the idle.

An easy way to verify timing on a 1.7, 2.0 is to set it at 3500 RPM to the
first fan blade to the right of the big thick fan reinforcing blades (there
are four, but only one in the proximity of the timing mark!)

Vacuum leaks cause strange idle problems. Always set well and timing first,
then adjust or fix the idle problem.

A final passing note is to check both vacuum advance, mechanical advance and
vacuum retard for proper operation. (Twist the distributor rotor and make
sure it springs back, evacuate the advance and retard making sure the points
plate moves smoothly back and forth.)

Good luck, Dan! Let us know if we can help you further.

Dear Pat,

Of course it is easy to mount a mirror on the passenger door of your 914 by
tapping out the factory nut plate (After removing the door panel) and the
left factory mirror can be reversed and used as a passenger mirror!

For years we have used the baby tornado mirrors by vitaloni. These are the
same mirrors used by the Ferarri factory and are easily mounted in the stock
914 mirror mounting holes with 6mm allen bolts. At $25.00 each, they are a
cheap alternative to the expensive ($95.00) factory mirrors.

Yes, they are.  I saw them in the Automotion catalog a few years ago for 
about $100, and I think that was per SIDE.

I made some for mine, by looking at the picture  in the catalog and taking
measurements on the car.  They run lengthwise, and essentially have two
sets of holes - one for the car and one for the seat.  If you can get your
hands on the seats it shouldn't take you too long to figure it  out.

BTW - I used 1/8" steel, good stuff, and grade 8 bolts.

Neil-
I just had a fairly similar problem.  In my case it turned out
to be a faulty brake master cylinder switch.  The switch on
the MC is designed to turn on the blinker if one of the
dual brake circuits fails.

Try disconnecting the MC swqitch entirely and see if the 
blinkier stops.  If it does, it's either the switch, or
indeed one of your dual circuits is bad.

You'll have to remove the protective plate under the car
to get at the MC.  To disconnect the switch just
pull the connectors off.

Hope this helps.

Subject: RE: Electrical help needed



Neil,

The symptoms are those of a bad chassis ground, probably back by
the tail lights. There are a couple of places to check, neither
one of which is very easy to get at:

The tail light assembly ground straps on '73's are by the towing
straps on either side in the back.

Also there is a pass-through multipin connector I think right and
left at the front close to the battery boxes and on the left rear
behind the electrical chassis that carries all the relays, ignition
module etc. (That assembly also has a ground strap) The pins on the
connectors get a little corroded and the resistance goes up. The relay
might be trying to latch and not getting enough voltage or not finding
adequate ground.

Turn your signal on and when it starts blinking dimly on both sides,
rev the engine to about 3,500 rpm and see if it returns to normal. If
it does, you have a voltage drop problem due to a bad connection
somewhere. It can drive you nuts, but if you have a good meter, you 
might be able to do voltage drop tests to isolate the problem a little
closer.


Good Luck,

Reid

In SCCA pro-solo autocross competition you can observe 911s against Vettes
and other fast cars. Pro-solo uses a drag-race start with timed starting
lights, and a straightaway.  With a decent driver, almost any 911 will BLOW
AWAY an american V-8 off the line, and for some distance, even if the 911
has less power. The 911 can use full throttle at launch, while a strong
V-8 will have to start at about 1500 RPM and feather the throttle for
some time, otherwise spinning the tires and going even slower. The
Mitsu AWD turbo would not have this problem, but has turbo lag and
the weight of a cadillac to contend with. The water cooled Porsches are
not great dragsters for the same reasons as above.

So, a 911 is actually quite a good dragster. Ask Scott Jessen if any car
has pulled him on the start of a pro-solo (other than a modified car).
And once you get ahead, it's very hard to catch up, and the other guy
will probably back off in a stoplight race anyway.

Subject: More 951 PS questions/results


Hello All;

Last week I asked about power steering fluid leaks on an '89 951.  The responses 
indicated two potential sources for the leaks.  First, the original Porsche hose 
clamps used on the return and supply hoses at the fluid reservior are inadequate 
and should be replaced by screw type clamps.  Second, the steering rack internal 
seals can leak, especially in colder weather.  This can be checked by pulling 
back the rubber boot at each end of the rack and looking for fluid buildup 
inside the boot.

Over the weekend, I searched for the source of my leak as directed above.  The 
dealer had already replaced the supply hose from the reservior and used the 
screw type clamps.  The return hose was somewhat covered with fluid, but I do 
not think this was the sole cause of the leak.  There is just to much fluid 
collecting on the splash shield and dripping onto the floor.  I crawled under 
the car (after jacking it up of course) and removed the splash shield.  The 
right side was still wet and dripping power steering fluid.  While I was under 
there I decided to change the oil while looking for my leaks.  What I found was 
interesting.  There is one section of line in the lower right behind what I 
assume is the oil cooler which goes from solid steel to 6" flexible rubber tube 
then back to solid steel.  There seems to be a leak at one of the joints.  Why 
would Porsche not just use the solid tubing all the way?  Also, I looked at both 
ends of the steering rack.  The right side of the rack was clean and dry under 
the boot.  The left side had a damp spot around the boot junction with the rack.  
There is also a little plastic screw at this point which was loose.  What is the 
purpose of the little screw?  I tightened it anyway.  Under the boot, there was 
power steering fluid evident on the toothed steel rack that wasn't visible on 
the right hand side.  Does this mean that the internal seals are leaking on the 
left side or is this normal?

Any help would be appreciated, otherwise the car goes back to the dealer on 
Thursday.  If some of the high pressure lines need to be replaced it looks like 
no fun ($$$) because there is much disassembly required.  If this is the case I 
may be able to live with the leak and buy stock in whoever makes Dexron ATF.

Subject: Danish cops etc.

Christian Holmgreen writes about three occasions when the Danish police let
him go, telling him "not to go so fast in the future."
 
There is a basic difference between police in Europe and police in the U.S.
(although cops everywhere seem to have the same basic mentality). In Europe,
they are civil servants, like postal workers or such everywhere in the
world. In the U.S., police are effectively tax collectors. Europeans
wouldn't expect their local tax collectors to cut them any slack, and by the
same token the money collector in uniform with the blinking lights on his
car usually won't give you a break in the U.S. either. "It's just my job,
sir. Tell it to the judge. Sign here."
 
On a similar note, as a resident of the recently bankrupt Orange County, I'm
more than a little interested to see what the SivilServantScum are going to
do with traffic violation fees to make up for their budget mismanagement.
Personally, I prefer a Stalinist approach to all this: fire ALL the O.C.
politicians and start over. You may fire some innocent ones by accident, but
at least you know you got all the guilty ones. They seem to breed like
rabbits anyway so they're not on any endangered species list. Now there's an
idea -- maybe somebody can develop a strain of mixomitosis that only affects
politicians?

Re 911 vs. Stealth/Mitsu 3000/Z car/RX-7 etc., there is one other factor:
depreciation. Porsches don't depreciate unless you curb surf regularly, or
enjoy shooting the pipeline down at the construction site. <g>  Go to any
library and pick up the blue book, or maybe it's black book for older cars,
and check out prices. If those don't list the price when new, you can get the
original selling price from old road test magazines (C/D, MT, R&T). Plot
curves of price vs. year for the 911, and compare it to any other sports car
on the road. The Japanese cars plummet, like anything else. The only car
that compares to the 911 is the Corvette.

The GM F-cars aren't even in the same performance league. The Corvette is
about an even match though. The build quality on the few GM F-cars I've
driven has been abysmal.
 
For the 993, I measured 0-60 in 5.34 sec, 0-100 mph in 13.54, 1/4 mile in
13.86 at 101.4 mph, 100 km/h in 5.60 sec, 0-400 m in 13.81 at 162.5 km/h,
60-0 braking in 119 ft.
 
I don't have current numbers on the Corvette.

Subject: Novice qq, carbs v. fuel injection

I am very much an auto mechanics novice, and even more so a porsche novice.

My goal is to purchase a used late sixties or early 70's porsche to use 
as a project car.  I just bought and read Andersons 911 performance 
handbook, and among my many questions, the most pressing is this:

It seems like for a beginner, the best type of engine would(IE most 
forgiving, simplest to work on)  would be the non gizmoed, non fuel 
injected, carbureted 2.0l  Is this a correct assumption?  I am kinda 
going on the premise that I will purchase a car, completely overhaul the 
engine, and in the process learn what I am doing..   Is this a completely 
arrogant assumption?  Is this doable? 

thanks for your responses:  sam

Philip,
I attempted to clarify your question as to "why release the clutch" in a
previous note.
You need to release (=engage) the clutch, so when you blip the throttle, the
engine is connected to the gearbox input shaft, and can accelerate the
shaft's revs to match the speed of the lower gear which is to be selected.

Subject: Re: New steering wheel leather

> Anybody have any experience with recovering a
> leather steering wheel?
 
After losing a fairly close autox when my leather wheel came apart in
my hands (made for interesting steering characteristics), I went to a
13" Dino wheel off my race car for a while. But when it became clear
that the smaller wheel, while great for me, was causing my wife to
agravate a chest cartilage tear I decided to have the factory wheel
recovered.

At first, I tried to get a friend who has a, ah, ummm, custom leather
goods business intrested in this. Sort of a sideline, as it were. No
dice. Motivating this was that I'd heard bad things about Alan Gun
Leather, the people who advertise hardest about their services.
I also tried my usual interior people, and also drew a blank. Eventually,
frustration set in and I had to ask myself, "How bad can it be?" So
off the wheel went to AGLA.

Well, it wasn't *THAT* bad, but it wasn't good. The stitching was
uneven, and somewhat amatuerish. The pieces weren't cut evenly,
and there was a little irritating bit on the spoke at 9 o'clock (this is
a 3-spoke 911 wheel). Still, it was usable, and was much better than
it was before it came back.

The foam core over the steel rim was also loose in a couple of places,
and there were other annoyances. I eventually bought a replacement
wheel that I never installed, deciding that I could live with the
original.

On the whole, I'd say that if you're going to be bothered by things like
I described, you'd be better off with a nice new MoMo or Nardi wheel.
Too bad you can't get the Personal E3 any more, or I'd recommend that...

In another topic I completely forgot about, there is this great older

about -- how to make a 356 into a respectible dragster. And no, it
does not involve any V-8s or blowers. It's a hoot! Much akin to "How to

January 1995

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

The end of a very long, not-so-great year! Here's hoping that the
coming year brings some joy to your lives...

I have a confession: driving a 32 year old car with no heat, some leaks
and a shot steering box is actualy FUN! Hard to believe this, but I'm
actually enjoying the 356SC as a daily driver more than I enjoyed
the 911. It's not even close to the same, but somehow.... Well, if
you have one, you'll know what I mean. If you don't already know,
there's no way I can tell you...

On the list, we're up by nearly 100 members from last month. Who's Who
participation is at a nearly all-time low at 33% though. I'll update it
a little later and get out a fresh edition. There are too many people
MIA due to the holidays to make it quite fair at this point.

There will also be a Porschephiles calendar coming soon too, featuring
planned stops on the 1995 ListMeister World Tour. 8{) Watch for it!
This *WILL* include the long-awaited pre-Parade First Annual Gathering
in scenic RENO, NEVADA, featuring *something* at PCNA. More details
as we go and a big THANKS! to Jim Pasha for his continuing work to help
pull this together.

Digest readers: the digest software still has one bug, that race condition 
which is hard to tickle. So if you get "doubled" digests, you don't 
need to tell me about it, I already know. It will eventually get fixed
and try not to worry about it in the meantime...

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no

you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 18 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME.

There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

FINAL NOTE: As I noted in a prior mailing, the FTP restriction above applies

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming

moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of

are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 if you have to.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me

You may want to check out the latest (Dec.?) issue of the british

C2 Tiptronic and C4). I think the author's choice was the C4 by
a very small margin.

P O R S C H E P H I L E S

The latest edition of EC [yes, I subscribe - don't shun me] that I
received here in the Old Country had an interesting article about
updating the 914 heat exchangers and muffler.  Actually, it mirrored what
many porschephilers have posted herein.  Namely, SS exchangers and Bursch
muffler and then the, "How To" information.  Quite handy.

R U S T  P R O O F I N G

The small part of the article that flailed hard was when they mentioned
coating the exhaust for rust proofing.  They suggest an aerosol spray on
"header paint" or Automotion's <g> brush stainless steel coating.  This 
is a waste of money and time.

Rusted mufflers are a major hassle.  It looks terrible, IMHO, and can ruin
the muffler quickly.  As the exhaust is aft of the wheels, rocks and water
that are thrown up off of the wheels combined with the heating and 
cooling of the muffler, contribute to an early death of the system.

I have tried header paint and even followed the instructions for heating
it, cooling it and re-heating to get the paint to bond.  It doesn't last.
Of course, if I owned a kiln the size of a refrigerator, it would be easy
to fire the entire system.  But, I don't, and the Bursch exhaust will not
fit into my Mom's oven :)

I realize that in certain drier climates, this is not too much of a worry.
So what is the answer?  Ceramic coating inside and out?  Is it worth it?
And then who does it?  Should the heat exchangers be coated?

Anyone have an answer?

Subject: Re: Novice qq, carbs v. fuel injection


Well...for my money a late 70s SC would be a good car, since there
shouldn't be rust to contend with, and the motor is pretty good in
stock form.  If you get into it you can throw carbs on, though that's
pretty dicey from an emissions standpoint.  The 3.0 ltr seems pertty bulletproof.

With an SC you get a better interior to start, seatwise, any you
already have flares, but for me the biggest selling point is lack of
rust and still reasonably low weight and cost.

Subject: RE: Novice qq, carbs v. fuel injection

Sam Halperin asks about late 60's/early 70's 911 as a learning exercise.  This
is certainly doable, especially if the car does not have to run on Monday
morning.  An earlier response mentions the 78+ SC'
s for their rustproofing --
a real good point.  I would also emphasize the importance of buying a good
running car rather than someone's shed full of problems however attractive the
price.  Believe me, you will get plenty of education KEEPING an old 911 running.
You don't need the indefinite and sometimes unbelievable expense of GETTING an
old 911 running.

Stan and others have mentioned the importance of contacts, and Porschephiles
provides some of what one needs.  The books tell how to assemble and maintain
the car assuming an inexhaustible supply of shiny new parts.  They don't tell
who to call, in your area, for a reasonably priced solution to specific problems
of rust, broken studs, metal fatigue, and the all-to-common book-says-this-
works-but-it-doesn't.  I've found the hardest part of amateur wrenching to be
finding the boundary between my own skills and what I should take to an expert,
and then finding an expert.  What really runs up the bill, in terms of dollars
and of UNfun garage time, is taking more than one try to find a solution that
works.

Anyway, get a running car.  Somehow problems are easier to solve if the pro-
blem dates from yesterday afternoon rather than the summer of 1982.  Good luck.
Try to keep a high ratio of road time to garage time.

Subject: Re: 959 sighting, car collecting

Hi,

Last year I was working in Munich. One weekend I was invited to Tegernsee by
some family friends .  Tegernsee BTW is where all the mega rich people from
Munich and the suburbs go to relax and socialize during the weekends (Yes,
these family friends were a bit on the stuffy side). Well on my way down
there, 3 959 were going back up to Munich.  It was almost perfect except
between the 3 was some random car that obviously didn't belong. If I remember
correctly there was a silver, red and I'm not sure on the last one but I
think it was blue. In any case it was a remarkable sight to me, which my
hosts couldn't appreciate. Showing interests in cars was beneath them. 

On another note. I consider myself to be an auto enthusiast and love my old
911. What is going to happen 20 years from now when C2 and 993 become
collectors' cars, much like the situation today with older 911s? MFI or
electrical gremlins are a pain in the ass, but how will the week-end mechanic
deal with DMEs and circuit boards etc. I wouldn't even think of trying to fix

Subject: Re: New steering wheel leather (LONG)

Howard,

>> Anybody have any experience with recovering a
>> leather steering wheel?

I am in the process of recovering mine right now.  I received a leather
cover for Christmas (it came from Automotion) and over the past couple of 
nights I have done a little bit of the stitching.  After some trial runs on
my tennis shoe I have come up with a pattern that looks very good.  When I
opened the box I noticed that they only supplied one needle and the 
picture in the instructions show two.  You need two.  I went down to Wal-Mart
and picked up a package of needles of various sizes.  What I have done up
till now is cut a piece of string (supplied) approx. 48 inches long (so it is
fairly easy to work with).  Thread a needle on each end. Then I held the wheel
between the left side of my chest and my left knee (perpendicular to my body
...yea, I pulled the steering wheel off), I started at one of the spokes and
pushed one needle through, on the right side of the wheel, from the outside
pushing the needle in towards the steering wheel.  I found the first hole on
the left side and pushed the needle through from the inside.  Then pull the
string and match up the ends and make them even.  You then have one needle on
the left side and one needle on the right side.
Then the pattern that I use is as follows:

1) Take right side needle and put it in the next available hole on the left
   side.  Put it in from the outside pushing in towards the wheel.  Push it
   in until it touches the leather on the right side.
2) Find the second available hole on the right side and push it through.  This
   will leave a hole open on the right side.  Pull the string, but don't make
   it tight yet.
3) Take the left side needle and put it in that hole you skipped on the right
   side.  Put it in from the outside pushing in towards the wheel.
4) Find the next available hole on the left side and push the needle through.
5) Pull both strings tight.  

Repeat the pattern until you get to the ends of the string or until you reach
the end of the leather (when you reach the spoke).  When you get close to the
ends of the string (when it is hard to maneuver the needle without the string
pulling out of the eye of the needle), repeat the pattern, BUT don't do step
2 or step 4. This will leave both sides of the string on the inside of the
leather (closest to the steering wheel).  You can tie off the strings in a 
knot and it won't show. You can then start the process over with another
length of string starting in the next available holes.  If you make sure
that when you begin again by pulling the string through and matching up the
ends that you do it exactly the same way as before (push from the outside in
and then from the inside out) as this hides the string and the first thing
you see on the outside is the string crossing. So far this looks really nice.

NeilK relates sighting a traffic jam of 959 near Munich and says:

Bavaria is probably the most visibly affluent place I have
ever visited. Porsche (928 and 911), huge MB S Class and
SL etc seem extraordinarily common. BMW 5 and 7 series are considered 
plebmobiles and suitable for photocopier salesmen and other low-life.
Nobody appeared cheap enough to drive the 3 series. When I was there
people seemed suprised I was driving a 911 (no, not because the English
are too cheap to drive anything except a Mini Metro) but because
it was five years old..eeeww, an old car! how yucky!

God know how the Bavarians make their dosh, but they are rolling in it.

Subject: More on washer bottles/windscrren spray

There has been a number of mail items about the washer bottles and strange
deposits causing blockages. I checked to see if this was the cause of my poor
windscreen jet wash - no joy but examination has prompted further question. 

  On examining the screenwashing system there is one feed pipe from the washer
reservoir under the wing to the pump and one outlet which is split into two
using a "T" fitting, one side goes to the screen washer jets the other back to
the washer reservoir under the wing. I checked this very carefully and consulted
the parts explosion microfiche - yes it goes streight back. Now pardon me for 
being so dumb but surely the water will be pumped back into the reservoir - its 
the path of least resistance, I even checked thius by blocking the return to 
washer reservoir path and yes we got real windscreen spray again. Has anyone
any explanation for this odd (to me at least) design andd equally how should
this be "fixed".

Thanks in anticipation

Hi, John Todd.
 
Yes, the 961 was the racing 959. I think it only ran Le Mans twice, also
once at Daytona. I have a bburago model of one Le Mans
entry. A lady I know who used to work in Styling did the graphics on that
one. I think they only built one or two of these things, total.
 
I never heard of the 953, but maybe that was the pre-959 all-wheel-drive
Carrera that won the Paris-Dakar in 1984? Don't know.
 
Yes, now that Rob Yasek mentions it, I remember the demise of one, or the
only, 961 at its second Le Mans outing, 1987. I have the video someplace, with
the sound from the pit radio patched in of I think Peter Falk telling the
driver (Kees Nierop) "Get out of ze car. Ze car ist on feier."

Subject: 944 cruise control problems


I'm having problems with the cruise control on my 86 944. Sometimes
it works fine, and sometimes just won't engage. I only really use
it on long trips, and it usually either works or doesn't - in
other words if it works, it keeps working for the whole trip,
and if it doesn't, it doesn't every time I try.

The symptoms are that when you push the lever it either does nothing,
or (most commonly) starts to engage (accellerator pedal moves), but
as soon as I release the lever it disengages.

Are there any common problems that I could check? I'm thinking it
may be a relay since I've had to replace the horn relay and the
instrument relay in the last year or so.

Thanks for any hints.

which specializes in repairing/reconditioning Targa tops. The shop is:

Subject: RE: Novice qq, carbs v. fuel injection

I'd like to add that my '70T starts every Monday morning as well as
every other day of the week (daily driver).  The point of buying
a good car up front should be well taken.  Old 911's can be bargins
to buy and fotunes to get in proper shape.  Many folks have bought
these cars for the price of an 8 year old Accord and found that they
can't afford proper maintenance, or the car has problems which they
choose to ignore and only get worse. I bought a car in that condition
and spent more than what the cost of a "better" car would have been
in the first place to get it up to spec.

 I believe an older 911 if in good factory running condition, and 
properly maintained will be a fun and reliable daily driver.  My 
maintenance schedule?  Oil and filter every 2-3K and into a shop 
once a year for a valve adjust and a once over looking for anything 
else needing attention. Btw, my car is driven about 3-6K miles a year.

I had to replace the disintegrated leather cover from my three spoke 911
wheel. I chose to do it myself using the AGLA product. The results where
good, and have lasted weel, but I will caution you that it is a *great* deal
of time spent hunched over a wheel that will not sit still! I eventually took
a steering shaft out of a 356 I was restoring, mounted the wheel on it, and
clamped it in a vice. 

If you picture sitting in front of the tube for an hour or two doing this,
think again! It took about 5 hours and my back hurt like hell. If you don't
mind the lack of quality Stan details in his response, go with the service at
the hundred dollars or so that it costs, barring quality concerns it is a
good value.

Subject: 914   December '94 sucked.


Greetings everyone.
  I'm still reeling from last month.  Boy I hate holiday funerals in Iowa. 
 big time!
  Too expensive, too wet, too lazy and too bitchy.

  I've got some business to settle with a few of you.  I will deal with that 
shortly.
          Please Stand By.

  But I thought to share with you my latest awwshit.
  -I gotta do a floorpan on the Saga of '76 <right now!>.

  EEeeewwWW !!  I knew the car had air leaks thru a couple rust holes
but when I started on the passenger side underseat supports. . . I saw what
no man should have to see;  Fiberglass patch compound hiding missing
panel segments, you know, like where rusty metal was removed.
  Skillfully concealed mind you.  Some wiley craftsman carefully taped
cardboard from behind and troweled in copious amounts of fiberglass
filler.  This did nothing for strengthening the body (to say the least!).
  The car's frame is compromised and now I wont drive it until repaired.
  So much for making use of the holiday break.

  One thing leads to another I reckon.  What started out as a simple probe
turned into a real nightmare!  I now have a 914 Flintstone mobile, only 
problem
is that where your butt should go is where the pan is now gone. . . I can 
climb in
and out thru the opening!     Go ahead, laugh!    Hey hey hey! bummer dude!
     <G>   <G>  <G>
  Oh, look dear. . . this car has a reverse ejection seat and a special 
access
port for changing spark plugs on #2 & #3!  how quaint!

  For me, this is not a horrible thing <really>, just a damn hassle and bad 
timing.
  It is winter, and I needed the car (or I get to fix my Olds Cutlass) and I 
dont
have access to a garage to work in.  Yep, I can shivver too.  Kansas.
  I still have my dignity in that 'I did it to myself'.

  So before Dr914 and all the other 914 pundits start giving me shit, let me 
say
that this problem is in good hands (mine).  And rest assured that the job 
will be
done well and proper.   I dont mind because of all the crap I've been thru
de-rusting a couple 914's; I have never done a floorpan before, but it wont 
be
insurmountable.  (just wish my rotisserie didnt require powertrain removal).
  Its all work that pays the same.  I just have to remind myself that I 
bought it
for cheep (and I got what I payed for).

  I dont suggest you try this at home.

  BTW, we took a 900 mile trip in my Z28 IROC last month.  Kinda loud, kinda 
rough.
Kinda Hello America!   Most impressive.  I covered the distance well above 
the
speed limits, many passing maneuvers.  A few gas stations (14 Gal. tank).

  I was gratified more than once by drivers who actually pulled over to let 
me pass!
  The drivers are aware of us . . . they just dont like that arrogant ass 
thing that goes
with operating a Porsche.  I for one, can understand their position, 
uniquely so.

 PS:  The sale of my employer did not go thru because of changes in the 
Korean
Gov't.  So our email address has not gone away yet.  The sale will go thru 
and
when it does there will be a grace period extending use of our address.
  Until then a reprieve.

  Toodles,

UPDATE

The end of a very long, not-so-great year! Here's hoping that the
coming year brings some joy to your lives...

I have a confession: driving a 32 year old car with no heat, some leaks
and a shot steering box is actualy FUN! Hard to believe this, but I'm
actually enjoying the 356SC as a daily driver more than I enjoyed
the 911. It's not even close to the same, but somehow.... Well, if
you have one, you'll know what I mean. If you don't already know,
there's no way I can tell you...

On the list, we're up by nearly 100 members from last month. Who's Who
participation is at a nearly all-time low at 33% though. I'll update it
a little later and get out a fresh edition. There are too many people
MIA due to the holidays to make it quite fair at this point.

There will also be a Porschephiles calendar coming soon too, featuring
planned stops on the 1995 ListMeister World Tour. 8{) Watch for it!
This *WILL* include the long-awaited pre-Parade First Annual Gathering
in scenic RENO, NEVADA, featuring *something* at PCNA. More details
as we go and a big THANKS! to Jim Pasha for his continuing work to help
pull this together.

Digest readers: the digest software still has one bug, that race condition 
which is hard to tickle. So if you get "doubled" digests, you don't 
need to tell me about it, I already know. It will eventually get fixed
and try not to worry about it in the meantime...

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

FINAL NOTE: As I noted in a prior mailing, the FTP restriction above applies

You may want to check out the latest (Dec.?) issue of the british
magazine "Car". It features a comparison of the current 911s (C2,
C2 Tiptronic and C4). I think the author's choice was the C4 by
a very small margin.

P O R S C H E P H I L E S

The latest edition of EC [yes, I subscribe - don't shun me] that I
received here in the Old Country had an interesting article about
updating the 914 heat exchangers and muffler.  Actually, it mirrored what
many porschephilers have posted herein.  Namely, SS exchangers and Bursch
muffler and then the, "How To" information.  Quite handy.

R U S T  P R O O F I N G

The small part of the article that flailed hard was when they mentioned
coating the exhaust for rust proofing.  They suggest an aerosol spray on
"header paint" or Automotion's <g> brush stainless steel coating.  This 
is a waste of money and time.

Rusted mufflers are a major hassle.  It looks terrible, IMHO, and can ruin
the muffler quickly.  As the exhaust is aft of the wheels, rocks and water
that are thrown up off of the wheels combined with the heating and 
cooling of the muffler, contribute to an early death of the system.

I have tried header paint and even followed the instructions for heating
it, cooling it and re-heating to get the paint to bond.  It doesn't last.
Of course, if I owned a kiln the size of a refrigerator, it would be easy
to fire the entire system.  But, I don't, and the Bursch exhaust will not
fit into my Mom's oven :)

I realize that in certain drier climates, this is not too much of a worry.
So what is the answer?  Ceramic coating inside and out?  Is it worth it?
And then who does it?  Should the heat exchangers be coated?

Anyone have an answer?

Subject: Re: Novice qq, carbs v. fuel injection


Well...for my money a late 70s SC would be a good car, since there
shouldn't be rust to contend with, and the motor is pretty good in
stock form.  If you get into it you can throw carbs on, though that's
pretty dicey from an emissions standpoint.  The 3.0 ltr seems pertty bulletproof.

With an SC you get a better interior to start, seatwise, any you
already have flares, but for me the biggest selling point is lack of
rust and still reasonably low weight and cost.

Subject: RE: Novice qq, carbs v. fuel injection

Sam Halperin asks about late 60's/early 70's 911 as a learning exercise.  This
is certainly doable, especially if the car does not have to run on Monday
morning.  An earlier response mentions the 78+ SC'
s for their rustproofing --
a real good point.  I would also emphasize the importance of buying a good
running car rather than someone's shed full of problems however attractive the
price.  Believe me, you will get plenty of education KEEPING an old 911 running.
You don't need the indefinite and sometimes unbelievable expense of GETTING an
old 911 running.

Stan and others have mentioned the importance of contacts, and Porschephiles
provides some of what one needs.  The books tell how to assemble and maintain
the car assuming an inexhaustible supply of shiny new parts.  They don't tell
who to call, in your area, for a reasonably priced solution to specific problems
of rust, broken studs, metal fatigue, and the all-to-common book-says-this-
works-but-it-doesn't.  I've found the hardest part of amateur wrenching to be
finding the boundary between my own skills and what I should take to an expert,
and then finding an expert.  What really runs up the bill, in terms of dollars
and of UNfun garage time, is taking more than one try to find a solution that
works.

Anyway, get a running car.  Somehow problems are easier to solve if the pro-
blem dates from yesterday afternoon rather than the summer of 1982.  Good luck.
Try to keep a high ratio of road time to garage time.

Subject: Re: 959 sighting, car collecting

Hi,

Last year I was working in Munich. One weekend I was invited to Tegernsee by
some family friends .  Tegernsee BTW is where all the mega rich people from
Munich and the suburbs go to relax and socialize during the weekends (Yes,
these family friends were a bit on the stuffy side). Well on my way down
there, 3 959 were going back up to Munich.  It was almost perfect except
between the 3 was some random car that obviously didn't belong. If I remember
correctly there was a silver, red and I'm not sure on the last one but I
think it was blue. In any case it was a remarkable sight to me, which my
hosts couldn't appreciate. Showing interests in cars was beneath them. 

On another note. I consider myself to be an auto enthusiast and love my old
911. What is going to happen 20 years from now when C2 and 993 become
collectors' cars, much like the situation today with older 911s? MFI or
electrical gremlins are a pain in the ass, but how will the week-end mechanic
deal with DMEs and circuit boards etc. I wouldn't even think of trying to fix
an electrical problem in a new Porsche, BMW or even a Volkswagen. I think it
will make the simpler cars of th e 70's and before even more desirable
because they will be easier to fix. Well that's what I think, but I won't
pass up a 993 in 20 years if given the chance.

Subject: Re: New steering wheel leather (LONG)

Howard,

>> Anybody have any experience with recovering a
>> leather steering wheel?

I am in the process of recovering mine right now.  I received a leather
cover for Christmas (it came from Automotion) and over the past couple of 
nights I have done a little bit of the stitching.  After some trial runs on
my tennis shoe I have come up with a pattern that looks very good.  When I
opened the box I noticed that they only supplied one needle and the 
picture in the instructions show two.  You need two.  I went down to Wal-Mart
and picked up a package of needles of various sizes.  What I have done up
till now is cut a piece of string (supplied) approx. 48 inches long (so it is
fairly easy to work with).  Thread a needle on each end. Then I held the wheel
between the left side of my chest and my left knee (perpendicular to my body
...yea, I pulled the steering wheel off), I started at one of the spokes and
pushed one needle through, on the right side of the wheel, from the outside
pushing the needle in towards the steering wheel.  I found the first hole on
the left side and pushed the needle through from the inside.  Then pull the
string and match up the ends and make them even.  You then have one needle on
the left side and one needle on the right side.
Then the pattern that I use is as follows:

1) Take right side needle and put it in the next available hole on the left
   side.  Put it in from the outside pushing in towards the wheel.  Push it
   in until it touches the leather on the right side.
2) Find the second available hole on the right side and push it through.  This
   will leave a hole open on the right side.  Pull the string, but don't make
   it tight yet.
3) Take the left side needle and put it in that hole you skipped on the right
   side.  Put it in from the outside pushing in towards the wheel.
4) Find the next available hole on the left side and push the needle through.
5) Pull both strings tight.  

Repeat the pattern until you get to the ends of the string or until you reach
the end of the leather (when you reach the spoke).  When you get close to the
ends of the string (when it is hard to maneuver the needle without the string
pulling out of the eye of the needle), repeat the pattern, BUT don't do step
2 or step 4. This will leave both sides of the string on the inside of the
leather (closest to the steering wheel).  You can tie off the strings in a 
knot and it won't show. You can then start the process over with another
length of string starting in the next available holes.  If you make sure
that when you begin again by pulling the string through and matching up the
ends that you do it exactly the same way as before (push from the outside in
and then from the inside out) as this hides the string and the first thing
you see on the outside is the string crossing. So far this looks really nice.

Bavaria is probably the most visibly affluent place I have
ever visited. Porsche (928 and 911), huge MB S Class and
SL etc seem extraordinarily common. BMW 5 and 7 series are considered 
plebmobiles and suitable for photocopier salesmen and other low-life.
Nobody appeared cheap enough to drive the 3 series. When I was there
people seemed suprised I was driving a 911 (no, not because the English
are too cheap to drive anything except a Mini Metro) but because
it was five years old..eeeww, an old car! how yucky!

God know how the Bavarians make their dosh, but they are rolling in it.

There has been a number of mail items about the washer bottles and strange
deposits causing blockages. I checked to see if this was the cause of my poor
windscreen jet wash - no joy but examination has prompted further question. 

  On examining the screenwashing system there is one feed pipe from the washer
reservoir under the wing to the pump and one outlet which is split into two
using a "T" fitting, one side goes to the screen washer jets the other back to
the washer reservoir under the wing. I checked this very carefully and consulted
the parts explosion microfiche - yes it goes streight back. Now pardon me for 
being so dumb but surely the water will be pumped back into the reservoir - its 
the path of least resistance, I even checked thius by blocking the return to 
washer reservoir path and yes we got real windscreen spray again. Has anyone
any explanation for this odd (to me at least) design andd equally how should
this be "fixed".

one. I think they only built one or two of these things, total.
 
I never heard of the 953, but maybe that was the pre-959 all-wheel-drive

Yes, now that Rob Yasek mentions it, I remember the demise of one, or the

I'm having problems with the cruise control on my 86 944. Sometimes
it works fine, and sometimes just won't engage. I only really use
it on long trips, and it usually either works or doesn't - in
other words if it works, it keeps working for the whole trip,
and if it doesn't, it doesn't every time I try.

The symptoms are that when you push the lever it either does nothing,
or (most commonly) starts to engage (accellerator pedal moves), but
as soon as I release the lever it disengages.

Are there any common problems that I could check? I'm thinking it
may be a relay since I've had to replace the horn relay and the
instrument relay in the last year or so.

Thanks for any hints.

I'd like to add that my '70T starts every Monday morning as well as
every other day of the week (daily driver).  The point of buying
a good car up front should be well taken.  Old 911's can be bargins
to buy and fotunes to get in proper shape.  Many folks have bought
these cars for the price of an 8 year old Accord and found that they
can't afford proper maintenance, or the car has problems which they
choose to ignore and only get worse. I bought a car in that condition
and spent more than what the cost of a "better" car would have been
in the first place to get it up to spec.

 I believe an older 911 if in good factory running condition, and 
properly maintained will be a fun and reliable daily driver.  My 
maintenance schedule?  Oil and filter every 2-3K and into a shop 
once a year for a valve adjust and a once over looking for anything 
else needing attention. Btw, my car is driven about 3-6K miles a year.

I had to replace the disintegrated leather cover from my three spoke 911
wheel. I chose to do it myself using the AGLA product. The results where
good, and have lasted weel, but I will caution you that it is a *great* deal
of time spent hunched over a wheel that will not sit still! I eventually took
a steering shaft out of a 356 I was restoring, mounted the wheel on it, and
clamped it in a vice. 

If you picture sitting in front of the tube for an hour or two doing this,
think again! It took about 5 hours and my back hurt like hell. If you don't
mind the lack of quality Stan details in his response, go with the service at
the hundred dollars or so that it costs, barring quality concerns it is a

  I've got some business to settle with a few of you.  I will deal with that 
shortly.
          Please Stand By.

  But I thought to share with you my latest awwshit.
  -I gotta do a floorpan on the Saga of '76 <right now!>.

  EEeeewwWW !!  I knew the car had air leaks thru a couple rust holes
but when I started on the passenger side underseat supports. . . I saw what
no man should have to see;  Fiberglass patch compound hiding missing
panel segments, you know, like where rusty metal was removed.
  Skillfully concealed mind you.  Some wiley craftsman carefully taped
cardboard from behind and troweled in copious amounts of fiberglass
filler.  This did nothing for strengthening the body (to say the least!).
  The car's frame is compromised and now I wont drive it until repaired.
  So much for making use of the holiday break.

  One thing leads to another I reckon.  What started out as a simple probe
turned into a real nightmare!  I now have a 914 Flintstone mobile, only 
problem
is that where your butt should go is where the pan is now gone. . . I can 
climb in
and out thru the opening!     Go ahead, laugh!    Hey hey hey! bummer dude!
     <G>   <G>  <G>
  Oh, look dear. . . this car has a reverse ejection seat and a special 
access
port for changing spark plugs on #2 & #3!  how quaint!

  For me, this is not a horrible thing <really>, just a damn hassle and bad 
timing.
  It is winter, and I needed the car (or I get to fix my Olds Cutlass) and I 
dont
have access to a garage to work in.  Yep, I can shivver too.  Kansas.
  I still have my dignity in that 'I did it to myself'.

  So before Dr914 and all the other 914 pundits start giving me shit, let me 
say
that this problem is in good hands (mine).  And rest assured that the job 
will be
done well and proper.   I dont mind because of all the crap I've been thru
de-rusting a couple 914's; I have never done a floorpan before, but it wont 
be
insurmountable.  (just wish my rotisserie didnt require powertrain removal).
  Its all work that pays the same.  I just have to remind myself that I 
bought it
for cheep (and I got what I payed for).

  I dont suggest you try this at home.

  BTW, we took a 900 mile trip in my Z28 IROC last month.  Kinda loud, kinda 
rough.
Kinda Hello America!   Most impressive.  I covered the distance well above 
the
speed limits, many passing maneuvers.  A few gas stations (14 Gal. tank).

  I was gratified more than once by drivers who actually pulled over to let 
me pass!
  The drivers are aware of us . . . they just dont like that arrogant ass 
thing that goes
with operating a Porsche.  I for one, can understand their position, 
uniquely so.

 PS:  The sale of my employer did not go thru because of changes in the 
Korean
Gov't.  So our email address has not gone away yet.  The sale will go thru 
and
when it does there will be a grace period extending use of our address.
  Until then a reprieve.

Subject: What motivates a purist mechanic ?

[This message is converted from WPS-PLUS to ASCII]

Hello 

Do all Porsche owners, older vehicle owners in particular, "suffer", "put up 
with lousy time management", "go screaming mad","wonder why they ever bought a 
Porsche", every time they take their pride and joy to the trusted 'years of 
experience' mechanic?
 
Don't get me wrong, I've got the best man working on the job. It's not the 
quality of his work I'm upset with, it's the attitude that time is unimportant 
almost like an artist working on his masterpiece.

But when he says "one day" he means a week, when he says "3 weeks" he means 2 
months. Do they all work one job at a time. We'll build the crank case first 
then order the barrels and pistons. 3 weeks later when they arrive and you think 
the job is nearly done they say "Where waiting for 3 valves, I ordered them last 
week" I think "why didn't order the 2 months ago".

It's not a money thing, he get insulted if I suggest ordering parts in advance 
and paying of the parts early. He often doesn't bill me for a month or two if 
I'm mad with him for letting me down again.

What trick's do you all used, so that you can plan when your car might come back 
after handing the keys over?

Please, don't say "Buy another Porsche". 

Why are the best mechanics such lousy business men ?

When I bought the 914 about a year ago, the first thing someone said to me
was "I hope you like the cold, the heater system suck's!".

Well, I have the opposite problem!! I can not turn the heater off entirely!
When you are AutoCrossing and it is 100 degrees outside, the last thing you
want is the heater on!!

Someone mentioned the the heater control knob did not have enough tension on
it, but when I checked it felt like it was tight enough. 

So, has anyone had a similar dilemma?? Since the weather is cooler in
Southern California right now  - it is not urgent. But the AutoCrossing
season will start soon and I would like to fix that before then.

> Anybody have any experience with recovering a leather steering >wheel?

When the leather steering wheel on my 911 had starting coming apart, I tried
to restich it myself. This was a disaster! I am pretty handy at fixing
things, but this project really humbled me.

After looking around for a good upolsterer, I took the steering wheel to a
John Moch from Moch-1 in Orange County. The outcome was FANTASTIC!! John does
all his own work so it takes a little time, but it is worth it.

Once I decided to start showing my 911 in the Zone 8 Concours series, I have
asked John to do a few other things to the 911. He has  recovered the Targa
Top, installed new OEM style carpet and put in a speaker system worthy of any
audiophile (his design). 

When I discover a someone that does exceptional work, I like to pass the word
along.

Subject: Re: Bushings

[Since a couple people have enquired about my 914 Weltmeister bushings
experience, I am posting this to porschephiles, too.]

Klaus & Henry:

The bushings are Automotion P/N PB-1012P (front, $40), PB-1005P (rear,
$40), and the grease is BP-172 ($2). I don't have any swaybars
(unfortunately).

I also put turbo tie rods on at the same time, but yes, I would say that I
noticed an improvement.  For example, it was raining here yesterday, and I
was provoking the car (914) into mild spins/slides.  The transitions were
very smooth, with no feelings of a "load change", and the corrections were
equally smooth.  Put another way, I felt nothing untoward in any load
transfers or other vehicle suspension dynamics.

I put liberal amounts of grease (it doesn't take much, actually) on both
sides of the bushings and on the A-arm & rear arm.  Note that this is
different from stock, where it appears to me that the inner surface of each
bushings was immobile relative to the piece it surrounds. One nice thing
about these bushings is that unlike the originals, they're dimensioned such
that it's very easy to remove them later.  You needn't be a gorilla to
install them.

I did have one problem with the pass.-side rear A-arm bushing - I had just
had the front suspension crossmember and the front and rear bushing
brackets powder-coated, and that particular bushing, when installed, felt
like it was going in against a slight taper.  The solution was to get it in
as far as possible (there was still a 1/4" gap remaining), get the
suspension bolted up into the body, and then use a nylon strap
tourniquet-style to pull the A-arm back into the crossmember.  Then pulled
the front cup back, torqued it down and everything was nice and tight.

HTH,

Andrew

	I have tried the type of spot welder you spoke of and found it 
tricky at best.  Kept burning holes in the steel.  Mind you,  I was 
inexperienced at welding at the time so your results may vary.  I then 
tried Oxy-Acetyline having so-so results after months of practice.  Then 
came MIG.  Aahh! this is how welding is supposed to work.  I was amazed 
how easy it was to use.  If you check out Harbor Frieght Tools 
(1-800-423-2567) you will find that they have a good selection of MIG 
welders at very resonable prices as well as many other goodies for us 
tool junkies.

	I'm sure some would argue but I think MIG welders are the way to 
go for all purpose welding.

Similar in that on my '71 914 1.8, I had no heat at all, but when I
took it on a skiing trip, I was able to wire the heat control levers
in the "on" position, and was quite toasty warm the whole trip. VT Rt. 7
is Awesome - and on the way to it, I went through the hairpin on MA Rt. 2,
which has a speed limit of 15mph, which is actually too high for most vehicles.
The Porsche went through it at 20, which was really quite something...
there used to be a gift shop on the outside of that curve, but a tractor-
trailer took it out a couple of years back.

I would suggest that you could most likely do a similar trick on your
914 - pull (or wire) the heat control lever on the heat exchanger into
the preferred position.

Well, all the mechanics of this type that I know will go to great 
lengths to get a car ready for the track. So... when you make an 
appointment you say you've got a PCA track event or autocross or whatever 
and you've *got* to have the car for then, well. (Don't lie, of course.)

A clean, obviously-well-cared-for car also gets better service as well, 
it seems.

My 83 911SC does not have a pop-off valve, so I just got one from
Zimms. I am looking through the installation procedures, and they
say to hole saw a 2" hole in the air box using the template supplied.
Fine. The question that comes to mind is where are all those little
plastic filings and pieces going while I am drilling this hole? Further
down in the instructions, they state "Vacuum up the chips in the air box,
and also inside the hole. A show vac or house vacuum cleaner will do".

Can you really get all the chips out? I am not concerned with the top
portion of the air box, since I can use my shop-vac and lots of protective
rags. I am concerned with the filing dropping into the lower section of 
the airbox as the hole is cut.

Any comments from people who have actually done it?

Nick:  You can have your cake and eat it too.  If you want good work on time 
you just have to find a wrench that will give it to you. Use PCA referrals, 
friends, this BB and whatever else you have to identify guys that are 
organized and keep their committments and do good work.  They're out there, it 
just takes some looking. 
 
If someone is a prima donna but does exceptional work only on  their own 
schedule then use them only if you're willing to put up with their 
idiosynchrysies.  If you can't live with their weirdness, go elsewhere if the 
quality of work doesn't offset the frustration of dealing with them. 
 
I think that what motivates a "purist" as you call him is the work.  They like 
doing the work, seeing the motor come together, caressing each part, etc.  The 
problem with this type of wrench is that they love the work process and are 
attached to it.  They're not attached to completion.  You on the other hand, 
are attached to completion. 
  
There are no artists in auto repair, only good craftsmen.  When someone adopts 
an idiosyncratic artistic attitude about fixin' a body, rebuilding an engine, 
or bleeding my brakes, I'm outta there.  Personally, the best wrenches I've 
met  set schedules, made committments and kept them.  It's what I have to do 
everyday and I demand it of anyone I'm gonna give my hard earned bucks to. 
 
So, if he makes you crazy, next time find someone else.  Nothing short of a 
frontal lobotomy is gonna change him.

Nick, what do you want speed or accuracy? Most independents are just
that ***independent***. If they are slow and do an average job... for
get it. If they are slow but do the job right then ok. Most of us could
not do the job faster ourselves,so what is the difference. If you want
a fast repair take your car to Mr. Goodwrench (using the term
generically of course) where everybody is more concerned with time

      Trond, I cannot weld any other way but I have used the Eastwood
 spot weld gun (that attaches thru an arc welder).  It can make beautiful
 and strong welds, the hard part is that the metal surfaces have to be
 -very very very- tight and clean, otherwise it will burn thru the top layer
 only. Spraying Zinc epoxy ("galvanizing spray") helps (I guess) but I
 would only use the gun if you are trying to cosmetically reproduce factory 
 type welds. For anything heavy or structural or hidden, I used my brother 
 and  a MIG !

      You might also consider trying a tool rental or welders supply
 place to see if you can get a "real" tong-type spot welder. I have no idea
 whether these work easier. If you are interested in buying one of these let 
 me know and I'll find the address/name of a place that is selling them for
  $380 (instead of Eastwood's $500).

     As far as their "metal bumping" accessories I'm sure they are great,
  however there is a real talent there that must be acquired (and I can
  only guess how to do it well !). If you find a book that might explain
  the art of shrinking metal (esp) please let me know (eg. the fact that
  all 50s and early 60's Ferraris were made by Luigi with a hammer and a
  tree stump is pretty darned incredible..!).

Subject: Difficulty Engaging 1st Gear and other P related Topics


Text item: Text_1

Having seen all of the net wisdom recently on problems of engaging 1st at speeds
above zero and consequential unhappy crunching noises, I would appreciate a 
response to the opposite problem. What is the likely cause of it often being 
difficult to get into gear while at rest but with the engine running? also if 
clutch depressed slightly ahead of lifting off gas for an up-shift during a 
spirited acceleration the tranny seems to be jumping out of gear. It has never 
popped out while clutch engaged and only gives this feeling for a relatively 
high power shift point.
Car is an 86 911 turbo with 4 speed and 55k miles.

Regarding discussions of removing 911 engine or complete engine tranny assy. I 
would be extremely concerned about abnormal loading on gearbox input shaft and 
possible the foreword mounts while trying to separate and reinstall engine. It 
would seem to me with the experience of one removal that it has to be 
significantly easier to undo the four bolts, drop the whole assy. and work in 
relative comfort for the rest of the job.

Having found time to put fingers to keyboard I'll ask the other couple of 
questions I've been meaning to ask. I am very confused about which fuel and 
ignition system is on my 86 930. I know it is CIS, but which? and what about the
ignition, is that independent with just vacuum/weights control? or is it linked 
to the ecu? if the latter are there any books available for it like those for 
the fuel system? I presume that it is CD.
Second question relates to fact that 2 inch or so of head lining has become 
loose, any suggestions for fixing it before it gets worse?

Happy Driving or Polishing (Whatever floats your boat!)to all for 95

Subject: Crankcase assembly status


Fellow maniacs,

The most expensive way to learn the art of automotive repair is to buy a 914
that was in a fire for $200 and rebuild it from square one.  

As you may recall while assembling the crankcase the crank would bind when
torque was applied to the case studs.  After sending my last message I went
back down to the "engine room" in the basement and re-checked everything.  
Much to my chagrin, the #4 main wasn't on it's dowel pin, the torque tried to
create one, and hence the bearing was completely shot.

After getting a new *set* of main bearings, I installed the #1 and #4 on their
respective dowel pins and used a pencil to make an alignment mark on the edge
of the bearing and the crankcase.  After a more careful procedure of assembling
the crankcase - everything is great.  The crank spins wonderfully and silently. 

I did not have the galley plugs tapped for the threaded variety, but I am now
going to be installing high-pressure relief pistons and the high-volume oil
pump.  What are the chances that the plugs will take the added oil pressure?

After the oil pump and relief pistons comes the installation of the 96mm NPR 
P&C kit.  Since I am working from a Haynes and "The 914 914/6 Handbook". I am
curious as to the things to watch out for at this stage of the assembly.

I will be installing center console gauges are there any sending units that
attach to the crankcase itself?  Namely, the oil-pressure sending unit?  If
so, where?

Also, I'm sure it will be covered later in the manual(s), but there is a 
sensor mounted on a bolt(13mm) at dead center on top of the crankcase.  What
is its function?

Inch by inch, step by step, I'll get everything together eventually and 
will be bringing you all along for the ride...

This may be premature, but we may have a T*d of the month candidate

Neil,

Going from neutral directly into first is always a little difficult with most
Porsche transmissions.  To make it much, much easier, pull into 2nd gear very
slightly before engaging first.  You will find that you can slip right into

915 transmissions rebuilt so you can shift them _hard_ ?

All this double clutching stuff has reminded me of
an advertisement that used to run in Pano.  It
was for a company called RaceForce I believe
and their ad went something like this:
"Can you shift up, down, fast and _hard_ ?"
And they basically offered a transmission
rebuild that would make a 915 (more) suitable for
autocrossing.  Perhaps someone here could
shed some light on this - I suspect others would
be curious about this too.

Subject: Three-Spoke Sport Steering Wheels


Hi all,

The thread on steering wheel covers got me to remember that the three-
spoke sport steering wheels used in the late seventies to mid-eighties
can fail at the outer weld at the rim. I broke mine at an autocross. 
It needed a new cover, which I purchased from an advertiser in Pano.

The rubber around the rim at the break was carefully cut, allowing for 
a reweld of the spoke to the wheel rim. I replaced the cut rubber section 
by epoxying it to the spoke/rim. I installed the new cover (a tedious but
not difficult task). I used the wheel for a year, then found a four-spoke
sport wheel to replace it.

If your three-spoke sport wheel flexes at the juncture of one of the spokes, 
get it fixed or replace the wheel pronto. These steering wheels were used 
on 911s, 924s, 944s and perhaps a few 928s. The failure is common, 
especially with cars that have been to the track (you have to hold on to 
something-at least the passenger can scream in terror).

I removed my airbox and split it into two halves - top and bottom.  Then
I drilled the hole, mounted the pop-off valve and reassembled the
airbox.  My airbox was slightly warped, but the two halves fit together
pretty well.  I used a thin bead of high temp RTV between the two
halves (there's a tongue-in-groove kind of a fit) and screwed it
back together.

Subject: Project 911SC - The work begins and some questions...

Hi all!  Hope everyone had a happy and safe holiday season.

Well, as I had threatened previously, this last week I embarked on my
great adventure at converting my '82 911 SC into a track/autocross car.

My initial goals are to focus on handling, safety, and reliability rather
than just horsepower while having a platform that could eventually
accomodate more HP when the existing powerplant gets too tired.

The car prep is oriented to POC J Improved classing (basically stock
w/minor performance enhancements).  I'm holding off on any performance
enhancements until I recieve the PCA club racing rules to determine
what I can do there...

What I started with:
- --------------------
'82 911 SC sunroof coupe, 130K miles (no records other than my own)

    Suspension:
       Strut/shocks: factory Bilstein (green) struts/shocks
       Sway bars: factory 19mm rear 21 mm front
       Torsion bars: ??? rear ??? front

     Engine: US Spec 3.0L (930/16?)
        Induction: Factory Bosch K-jet w/o pop-off valve
        Exhaust: Factory exchangers w/Bursch sport muffler
        Original Factory tensioners
        Leaking oil-return tubes
        

     Wheels: BBS RA in 16x7 and 16x8 (and no, they're not bent
             or gold...;-))
     

      About 40lbs of Alpine stereo gear (now piled neatly in a box)

Now, the issues:
- ----------------
Engine:
The motor runs pretty well, so I've decided to not mess with it other than
taking steps to attempt to prolong its life by performing the following
updates:
 - carrera tensioners/chain ramps
 - pop-off valve
 - radiator-style oil cooler
 - tune up and valve adjustment
 - general clean-up

After stripping off all the sheet metal I managed to get the entire exhaust
off without breaking any studs.  I owe a debt of gratitude to the kind
soul who recommended a couple of doses of penetrant on the exhaust nuts 

prior to attempting the removal.  


I proceeded to replace the tensioners (kit from AJR) and had some
general questions:

1. How much slack in the chain is acceptable?  There is about 1/4" play
at the ramp on the left side.

2. If I choose to replace the chain ramps, should they all be done at once
and, if so, is it humanly possible to get them all without splitting
the case?

Regarding exhaust:
I'm considering the purchase of the AJR RSR-style headers with both
megaphones (for Las Vegas) and a sport muffler (for Laguna Seca and
an occasional autocross).  Any suggestions as to what the right
diameter would be to use on a 3.0L with CIS?  I was thinking about
going 1 3/4" for the track, but does the CIS flow well enough to
make it work?  


Next issue: Suspension

Thanks for your help,

Subject: 944 engine work questions

I have a 1984 944 (59,000 miles) which runs great, but has high
oil consumption (one quart per 500 miles).  The problem is in cylinder 3,
based on a leak-down test (5%, 5%, 23%, 5%), and on oil-fouling
of the 3rd plug.  So, I'm getting set to get the problem fixed, and
and looking at alternatives.
 - I have an excellent small-garage mechanic I've used for years, and
   he's highly proficient at engine overhauls.  His rate
   is way below Porsche specialists, BUT, he's never worked on a 944!
   Is th
ere anything (other than the honing/reboring issue below) about
   removing and working on a 944 engine that should keep me from using him?
 - Although the cylinders looked good when the head was off awhile back,
   I want to be prepared in case they need work.  I haven't found a machine
   shop in central Virginia that knows what to do with the 944's aluminum
   block.  Is special equipment needed for honing?  for reboring?
   (One shop told me to find a shop with a Sunnen machine).
 - Is removal of
 the 3rd piston with the block still in the car worth
   considering?  Would that repair save enough (compared to
   a full block removal and overhall) to be worth it, or would such a
   shortcut be shortsighted?
Thanks,

 Not meaning to be so negative on Japanese cars but, I have to agree.
It has also been my experience with the Mitshubishi in general as to it's
poor quality. The proof is in the value after 50k mi. Take a look some
time and see what the market brings for used Mitsi's. I don't beleive
that I have ever driven a car built with such temporary quality.

I have been living with a Power Steering leak on my 944 for a number of years now
and have paid the price for it as the PS fluid has almost totaly eaten away one

Having just been through this on a 356, and having done this a few times
on my various 914s and 911s, I can assure you this is NOT uncommon. All
of the cable operated gizmos in these cars are *designed* to be lubricated
from time to time. So, 'fess up: how often have you *ever* lubed heater
cables? That's what I thought....

You need to go to the appropriate flapper box and disconnect the cables,
then do two things (in any order): 1) operate the flapper and make sure
that it's working, not binding, etc. so that it *CAN* be cable operated
and (2) operate the control to make sure the cable is moving. If it is,
squirt something like graphite lock lube up the cable housing and work it 
some more. If it's not, get a replacement cable. Once you're sure that
all of the moving parts move, the rest is simple: position the control so
that it's in the right place for when the flapper is in the "default" 
position (most are spring loaded so there is a "default"), then adjust
the cable accordingly. Then test it. You may have to fiddle with the 
adjustment.

Once you've done this and gotten it right, you almost certainly won't
have to *EVER* do it again. Unless you keep the car another ten years
or so....

Attn: Mrs. Hoppe

Mrs. Hoppe is aware that USA orders may be coming in.  It would be best =

I thought those were pretty outrageous instructions too, letting all
that glass-filled-plastic dust fall into your baby's private places.
But, pulling the airbox means pulling the engine (as far as I know).

When I drilled, oops, I mean sawed that
hole, I pulled off the intake runners for #1 and #4, stuck the vacuum
hose into the #1 hole, and ran the vacuum *while* I sawed.  I don't
think any chips made it to the floor of the box, if they did I sure
couldn't see 'em.  And, no melted plastic appeared at the muffler
outlet! :-)

BTW the airbox plastic is moderately brittle, be careful of the
stiffening ribs molded into the outside of the box, they DO break!

Subject: Early 911 tach vs 911 SC tach


Hi 'philes,

What exactly is the difference between a tach for a 2.x 911 and
a tach for an SC?  If you put a 3.0 SC engine in an early 911,
can you rewire the old tach, or do you need to buy the SC tach?

This 3.0 SC engine has Webers.

Thanks,

Yikes! Sounds like a baaaad system. Around here it's a joke saying that
around xmas the cops are out collecting tickets to pay for their xmas 
lunch - over there it's reality...

Btw, do you actually have to sign the ticket??? Here we don't even has to 
speak to the cop if we don't want to... We most certainly don't have to 
admit the offense... (nice, liberal country... It makes a bit up for the

Gist of the story is this: sure, you can do that. But you transfer
all that "wear" from the soft, inexpensive synchros to the harder,
very expensive gearsets. And the intermediate plate. And the main
shaft.

It's *ONLY* appropriate for racing applications where you have
planned to take it apart from time to time and measure wear. Or
applications where you can afford to have the transmission just
seize up on you as you drive.

I have 6,500 miles on my 2wd '95 911 Carrera and as an avid track driver
and autocrosser would not own the 4wd version due to push (understeer).  I
know, I know.  The automotive publications say that this is no longer the
problem it was in the previous C4.  Only the January '95 Road and Track
review of the new C4 indicates that the typical all-wheel-drive tendency to
push still exists.

   "In slow, 90-plus-degree corners, the C4 still feels stable. But it
understeers, so much so that power-on exits often found the steering wheel
reaching full lock.  What's more, throttle liftoff only slightly reduces
understeer-in contrast to the C2 in which a reduction of power brings the
tail out slightly and allows the front tires to get a bite."

The last two paragraphs of the article conclude:

   "If I were a Porsche purist who knows how to drive and enjoys doing so
every time he slips behind the wheel-and who fully understands the meaning
of rear-engine weight bias-the Carrera would get my vote. It's lively,
responsive, challenging. And a bargain at just under $60 thou.
   But if I were the same fella and realized that there's a lot to be said
for all-wheel-drive stability and all-weather traction, the new Carrera 4
would get my nod. But then, it already has."

It comes down to how you are planning to use your new 911.  For me, the
added weight and particularly the understeer (autocrossing has many slow
tight corners and race tracks often have one as well) make me favor the 2wd
version (of course that version was all that was available when I purchased
mine).  I would get the ABD and limited slip package option with the 2wd
911.

I bought my first Porsche, a 73 914 2.0, in 1991.  What was supposed to be
a quality, stock, rebuild, wasn't any of the three, so we set out to put
the engine together with all stock parts.  The car was to be our first
serious SCCA stock autocrosser, and as such, stock meant stock.  My guide,
Steve Compton had rebuilt many 914 motors, and his stand on oil galley
plugs was, if they didn't leak, and if they looked like they had been in
there since the good Dr. P put them there, they should be considered safe.
Accordingly, we completed the procedure.  After breaking the car in on the
street for about 1500 miles and numerous local autocrosses, we trailered
it to Phoenix for my first ever Pro Solo event.  Damndest thing.  Saturday
morning I went out and jumped in the car, hit the key, and waited for the
oil light to go off.  It didn't.  Shut the car off, restart (probably just
a loose wire, donchaknow?)  Wrong.  Shut car off again, look at wife, try
to give (fraudulent) impression that I have a clue.  Get out.  Look under
car.  Hmmm.  No wonder there's no oil pressure.  The oil is laying in the
gutter where it's subject to about 1 bar, but in no particularly useful
way.  Oil galley plug found mid-puddle.  Conclusion:  scrimping on oil
galley plugs will work just fine; that is unless you ever plan on
dragging the car 30 hours roundtrip for an important event, in which case
if you're lucky, they'll abondon ship somewhere other than on the track.

That was my first Porsche, and today I just bought my fourth!  Is this
healthy?

My mechanic is beyond reproach.  He can generally take my 911 at a moment's
notice for an "emergency" repair.  Appointments for routine maintenance are
no problem.  The final price for a repair *always* comes in less than his
quote; which is significantly lower than the Porsche dealer charges for
"similar" work.  He has my 911 ready when promised.

Now in return for this, I must trust him to make the decisions regarding
repairing my 911.  For example, about 6 months ago my alternator went on
the fritz.  I suggested a rebuilt unit, he opted to rebuild mine (saving me
lots of money BTW).  So far, so good. I don't mind giving up some control
regarding decisions since he as always been right on the mark.

Now mind you, I'm not constantly going to his shop, my 911 is an extremely
reliable daily driver,  but when I do, no problem.  I suppose it helps that
he is active in my local PCA region.

Considering some of the horror stories I've heard regarding Porsche
reparirs, I must consider myself VERY lucky!

	I suspect that each generation is more in touch with technology
than the last. By the time the 993 is 20 year sold, many of the
"enthusiasts" will consider a DME to be no more difficult to diagnose/fix
than we would consider current technology (relays?). Or perhaps they will
just swap things over (does it *really* cost more to produce a DME brain
than, say, a brake caliper) as parts become more commonly used (in 20
years time *every* car may have a DME unit) and therefore cheaper. [Note :
I really MUST make my sentence constructs simpler!!]

	Also appropriate tools will be more cheaply available. The two
things which are required to maintain a car (IMHO, of course) are (a)
education/training and (b) adequate tools.

	Then again, maybe they will follow the route of the 924 and become
"not economically repairable" and sent to the scrapheap :-(

Kevin,

	I suspect that you will find that the T-piece, when working,
contains a 1-way valve. I suspect that it opens at a particular pressure
so that, if the washer jets are frozen solid, the water being sprayed will
return to the reservoir rather than damage occuring to the pump.

	I know that when I had poor pressure to one of the washer jets on
my 944, the culprit was the 1-way valve in the T-piece. I had assumed that
it was "just" a T-piece and spent lots of time trying to figure out what
the problem was.

	The only other thing I can think of is that said tube is the feed
to the headlight washer system. Does your car have this?

For you non Deutsch fluents, Munchen (with the umlaut, the two dots over

The 944 washers have to be the worst bit of design on the whole car -

Not long ago, I posted what became a survey question about
a leaking targa top.  By far, the most popular advise was:
"Accept it, and carry a towel."  Being a manly man of the
male gender, this is OK...in fact, it reinforces my manliness.
However, I am still looking for that SO of the female form.
Occasionally, I even manage to maneuver one into sharinga ride
in my car.  Since these prospects don't have nearly as manly
a manner as most of us men, I've decided to fix the problem.

In fact, I also decided it is time to reconstruct the whole top.
So, I have ordered all the rubber seals, a new roof skin and
headliner.

Before I begin, does anyone have any suggestions or warnings
about installation?  What sealant/adhesive is used for the
rubber on the windshield and targa bar?  Can anyone suggest
an uphostery shop in the Houston area for doing the vinyl top?

And, does anyone know how to avoid the fraying of the cloth
covering the targa bar seal along the door windows?  I've never
seen a 5+ year old Targa that does not have this ugly problem.

I found something that I have wanted to play with, but haven't done the

There's an outfit that makes an oil-cooler based heater for VW Beetles.
Seems that you could mount this oil cooler gizmo in the hole
for the gasoline heater, hook up the right plumbing and have a dandy
heater. Of course, you'd *REALLY* need to have some sort of Y-valve
so you can bypass it in the summer, or route it off to another heat
exchanger that doesn't warm the interior at least...

I can find the details if you're interested. Or it should bein the early

If you can find them, Hinkle's is *wonderful*. They did mine in one
afternoon for about $200, including all the covering/headliner

That's a $20 fix at a competent shop. There's this black cheesecloth looking
stuff that gets glued over the seals. It's a Mercedes trick... Hinkle
can do it.

If you can't find Hinkle, shoot me a note. If you do, shoot me a note anyway

Hi,

I bought a '73 911S targa in August  and since I bought it I  wanted to know
what the original name paint color was. So I requested a certificate of
Authenticity from Porsche in November and got it yesterday in the mail. I
always assumed that the paint was a light yellow or beige color. When I
looked at the certificate it listed the color and code as Rose Red 4610. This
obviously doesn't match my car. The code also doesn't correspond to the
Kunstharzlack plate in my car which has 132-9-1 written on it. The car has
been repainted, but the door jambs and trunk are the same color as the rest
of the body.
So my question is- What does Rose red look like and what does 132-9-1 mean. 
Lastly, it says "Fog Lamp,White, Over Bumper".  I took the non-original fog
lights off my car. What did the old one look like? Where they like the chrome
ones but painted white?

Dave O. Blanchard (blanch@capella.cup.hp:com:):  Thanks for your quick
response. I had not thought of the aluminum filler neck as the culprit. The
symptom is fuel odor in the car when I have a full tank. I noticed gas on the
outside of the tank when I removed the passenger side rear wheel and that is
what led me to the rubber filler hose to gas tank interface as the probable
cause. What I am worried about is a possible crack in the gas tank itself. I
know that if that is the case I'm probably looking at having to drop the
transmission/differential to get to the tank. I have know idea how to fix the
tank if it does indeed have a crack.

Bursch mufflers don't seem to work well on 911s w/MFI.  (Our engine is a
stock 2.2 911E, installed in a 914-6.)  Caused a very lean condition between
2700 and 3400 rpm that could not be adjusted out.

We installed a "factory-type" muffler: ANSA, at about half the price; problem
gone.  Louder than factory, quieter than Bursch.

Hi, Scott.
 
I have the 914 book too. I tried to interest several publishers in bringing

all say production would be too expensive with such a large format color

You don't need to go all the way to Munich. The biggest bookstore in
Stuttgart should have it in stock. It's Konrad Wittwer, the main store is on
the Koenigstrasse across from the Kleiner Schlossplatz. That's where I got
my copy.
 
If you continue down the Koenigstrasse, away from the main train station,
cross under street at the end to get to Marienstrasse, there is a fairly
decent model car shop in the arcade there, I think the arcade is called the
Marienpassage. The shop is Model Car Center Stuttgart, behind the movie
theater.
 
Also a general toy store, Spielwaren Kurtz, is on the market square across
from city hall (Marktplatz). Sometimes they have cars that MCS doesn't have.

Greetings,

I am having problems with my A/C.  Hit the switch and the fuse blows.

I had my mechanic look into the problem, bad A/C clutch.  He disconected 
the clutch until I can afford to replace it.  

It appears he used a 10amp fuse for debugging rather than the 7.5amp the
circut is supposed to have.  Question: could using the larger fuse have
caused any damage to the A/C system?

Hi, Steve,

The short answer is probably not.

The true test is to try to use the AC with the clutch disconnected and see
if everything else (radiator fans, heater blower, flapper valves, etc.)
works as it should.  If all that is OK, no damage occurred.

Neil,

The "white" fog lights are most likely clear glass, as opposed to yellow
which were also available.  This makes you original factory "fog lights" more
properly "driving lights," perhaps.

These lights were mounted on special brackets where the '73's have little
black grills next to and inside of the parking lights.  Earlier cars have
chrome grills here, I believe.  In all cases these are special grills with
cut-outs to allow the fog light bracket to protrude.

Re color, someone with the color codes out there will no doubt help you right
away.  It probalby is, in fact, the rose color specified by the factory but
with the paint mfgrs code versus the Porsche paint color "part number."  And.
. .it certainly can't be yellow, I would think.  If this color code does not
correspond then something is amiss, wrong color plate, chassis number, etc.

I would look for some kind of bind in the tensioner or water pump.  Also
look for some kind of damage to the pulleys involved.  Don't forget the
crankshaft pulley.  Other than that, I would leave the belt covers off this
time, so that you can easily check on the wear of the replacement belt...

Shouldn't be a problem.  I have several Audis and use Continental belts when
I get them with no problems before.

Probably not a bad belt, but keep an eye on the new one...

Dear Kyle,

We are very glad to see that you intend to save your 914. In our zeal to save
them all we have contracted to have all of the rust area patch pnels make,
ignoring the tooling expense (it gets very tight here at times, however
because besides paying tooling costs, we have to commit to a 2000 piece run!)
However, rest assured that in the futur we will have available everything one
needs to completely restore the rustiest 914 body - and cheaply!

Thankfully, the bodies are easy to piece back together and with modern
welding and grinding equipment, anyone can be a reasonable welder in an hour.
The only problem is time. We invest hundreds of hors in 914 body restoration,
but the finished product is always marvelous. Good luck, Kyle and keep the
914 faith!

Dear Lee, 

Rust conversion paint is available in many different brands, but POR-15 is by
far the best - we have tried them all. POR-15 dissolves the rust and dries to
a tough sealed coating ready for top coat. When glossy and dry, POR-15 will
not come off even when heated or hit with a hammer!

The paint stripper we have used for years is Aircraft Kleenstrip Remover and
it is now available in a spraycan which eliminates much of the mess!

If the Porsche factory had coated all of the 914 metal panels before and
after assembly with POR-15, they would not have rusted! Sadly, the product
was not available then.

Subject: steering column lock housing

Greetings fellow fanatics! And Happy New Years!

I am looking for some used parts for my '84 944. The steering
wheel lock no longer functions on my car (is this common?)
so I want to try to rebuild it. The ignition switch contact
that opens when the key is removed also no longer functions,
and I assume they are related. Especially considering that I
have a new ignition switch. So, I want to rebuild my ignition
lock. However, I don't want to take my old one apart until I
obtain another to examine and as a source of parts. So, I
need the following:

* the steering lock housing: 321.905.851.D (the steering
   column goes through a bearing in this housing)
* the lock cylinder: 477.905.855.C (with a key so I can get it
   out of the housing).

I believe that these parts may interchange with those of a
924, since the early 944's had the same interior as the 924.

If you have these parts and are willing to sell them, please
email me directly at ericb@microsoft.com.

Thanks,

Howday,
We have a 74 911 that we autocross & just won a set of 22mm front adjustable sway bars to replace
the 19mm stock ones. ( Thanks Automotion for the door prize)
So far we have lowered the car some and put in steering rack spacers and Turbo tie rod ends.
We run 7" rims and 205x50 tires Yoko A008 tires. In this part of the world this puts us
in the first level of modified class. We can change to adjustable sway bars and add a shock
tower brace and adjustable rear spring plates. We can not change the torsion bars.
The question is:
 Should (must) we replace the stock 19mm rear sway bars with 22mm to match the
front or is this not important?
 Any great benefit from the shock tower brace and the rear adjustabel sping plates?

Thanks for you opinions.

My '86 951 cruise failed (became erratic).  When I replaced it, the 
[used] replacement box also had the aspect you noticed: Pushing the 
lever accelerated the car; releasing it "hiccuped", that is, dropped 
the throttle and then picked it back up.

Normally with your symptom I'd suggest checking the steering column 
control and related wiring, but given my symptom too I'd think it was 
the box itself.  In any event, testing the column switch is free but 
replacing the box isn't, so that might be some guidance!

Also check that your clutch and brake pedal sensor switches are operational.

I had this same leak on an '83.  Solved it by selling the car.

I examined everthing very carefully too, and never found anything 
obvious.  Tightened all the hardware to no avail.

You must use the correct, original-type clamps for one thing - standard 
clamps don't seal well in some situations.  Maybe try "gooping" 
everything too with a sealer.

Sorry I couldn't be more helpful, but it's an ugly problem!  Maybe 
compress some colored, insert gas in the filler and see where it comes out.

If the symptom is common to all gauges, then so is the problem & 
solution (probably...  ;-) ).  Find the common grounding point for all 
the brown wires under the dash.  Check that the connection is very 
clean and bright copper colored.  Same for all terminals connected to 
that point.

Also check any common switched +12 VDC lines coming into the cluster, 
as many gauges have a constant hot feed and a variable ground 
connection through their sensor.

Next, check the connector on the instrument cluster itself - bad 
contacts, dirty, loose, etc.

Special equipment & techniques are *required*.  The silica within the

With a 1984, you may well have to do a lot of work down under.  I would 
*absolutely* pull the engine to enable complete access and bearing 
inspection & replacement.  It's a big job but well, well worth it.  
Then again, this assumes you'll be keeping the car and want to take 
very good care of it.

Plan on spending some serious money and finding stuff you hadn't 
planned on.  I'd be willing to wager that #3 isn't the only problem...

> The responses

[...]

I just saw your message!  Amongst the many failures I've had on my '86 
951, I can render experience on 2 rack failures due to leaks.

In both cases, the end seals gave out, dumping fluid into the bellows 
at each rack end.  You can drive the car w/o fluid if you disconnect 
the power pump by removing the belt.  (This is easy to do and in fact 
is how I got home from a track event last summer.  But you'll want 
strong upper arms before driving the car this way!).

One mechanic suggested that the failure was caused by the rack getting 
microscopic pitting through time [and winter storage???].  Those pits 
tear at the seal, which has around 1500 psi behind it, so it leaks 
quite handily.

The first rack lasted 6 years.  The replacement rack was reconditioned 
by a Pano advertiser, but I don't think they polished that rack - they 
just popped new seals in and wham they're done.  So it only lasted 1 
year.  This gives credence to the pitting theory above (but no 
scientific evidence).

The next rack will be new, via the aftermarket to ZF.  New racks 
through PCNA are $1600 or so these days.

So, best bet is to replace the rack.  It's gonna fail sooner or later.  
Just be wary of rebuilt racks.

I had a "gas leak" in my '75 911.  I was autocrossing, and after 
every run I would notice a smell of gasoline in the car.  This was 
obviously rather disturbing.  I looked all over between runs for 
dripping, smelled under the car, in the boot, etc..

Turned out that the cork gasket in the gas-cap was getting old and
compressed.  Whenever the gas would slosh up the filler neck in hard
cornering, it would leak out around the cap.  I just turned over the
cork (temporary fix...) and went back to racing with no more stench.  

This is a cheap thing to fix...

Yeah, I like the part in the instructions that says "lowering the engine
may be required for installation".  I just went ahead and drilled the
hole and then duct-taped the plastic pour spout of my 2 gallon gas
conatiner onto the end of my shop vac hose and used this contraption
to suck all of the shavings out of the lower portion of the airbox.  Call

work OK.

BTW, an airbox can be pulled without pulling the engine.  I didn't think
so, but a shop I hang around every once and a while did it on a '77.

Good luck!

I had this done on the 4-spoke steering wheel and shift knob of my '86 951. The

gaps where they cut away original leather and replaced it. Ugly and noticeable
at a glance. More driving pulls the gaps apart. Perhaps, if it had been glued

there with a chipped windshield in terms of constant annoyance. If I had to

Hmmm, I'm almost tempted to take this as a testimonial in *favor* of
Bursch on cars with closed-loop fuel systems.  

Reasoning: Bosch 911 MFI is a totally open loop system; from throttle
position and engine RPM it derives engine airflow (carved into its
internal space cam) and thus knows how much gas to inject.  The space
cam is specific to the engine airflow characteristics (volumetric
efficiency) and depends, among many other things, on the exhaust flow.
Sounds to me like the Bursch flows a little more air between 2700 and
3400, allowing better cylinder filling; your MFI unit, not knowing about
the new muffler, keeps injecting the same old amount of gas.  Result: a
lean spot.

On any car with an air flow sensor (carbs, flappers, hot wires, MAP
sensors), this extra airflow would be detected and extra gas would be
injected.  Presumed result: a little extra torque between 2700 and 3400
rpm, or whatever rpm band the extra flow was in.  'Course, there might
be *less* flow in some other rpm band... the laws of physics tend to be
like that, I don't know any specifics in this case.

Anybody had a Bursch muffler on a dyno and care to comment?  I know
Pressler has dyno curves for *his* modified mufflers...

2) Buy a car that runs as apposed to one that doesn't.  A cheap non

3) Avoid very early models..  ('64-'68)

4) The '69 -'73 are reccomended as good early models.

	b) The 70-71 are also carbureted (zenith)

I'm considering buying snow chains to keep on hand in my 944 Turbo.
I have stock tires on the car: 205/55 in front and 225/50 in back.

The owner's manual says that with the large tires I have on the rear
(drive) wheels, "the snow chains must be tensioned and retensioned
with the utmost care, to insure [sic] unimpeded rotation."

That doesn't sound encouraging to someone like me who knows
nothing about (1) selecting or (2) installing snow chains. 
Should I just make darn sure that I always take the Subaru
when I head for the mountains any time between September and
April, or is there hope for me learning to install chains
without scraping the fenders off my 951? 

Should I investigate some alternative to traditional chains, 
such as those new thingies that consist of spiky plastic strips 
attached to a central piece that snaps into the wheel cover? 
Maybe those stick out just as far from the tire as do regular 
chains, though. Any ideas?

It is a waste of money.  I used this set up in a Type I and it is a receipe
for disaster.  The heater does not put out enough heat to do anything
besides defrost your rear window.  Secondly, if not set up correctly, you
have the chance for a major oil leak.  The kit comes with cheap rubber hose
and worm clamps.  The idea is that during the summer, you move the unit out
of the interior of the car so that you have an additional "oil cooler".
IMHO, there are better, OE ways to heat yourself to toasty comfort level.

Subject: steering column lock housing

Greetings fellow fanatics! And Happy New Years!

I am looking for some used parts for my '84 944. The steering
wheel lock no longer functions on my car (is this common?)
so I want to try to rebuild it. The ignition switch contact
that opens when the key is removed also no longer functions,
and I assume they are related. Especially considering that I
have a new ignition switch. So, I want to rebuild my ignition
lock. However, I don't want to take my old one apart until I
obtain another to examine and as a source of parts. So, I
need the following:

* the steering lock housing: 321.905.851.D (the steering
   column goes through a bearing in this housing)
* the lock cylinder: 477.905.855.C (with a key so I can get it
   out of the housing).

I believe that these parts may interchange with those of a
924, since the early 944's had the same interior as the 924.

If you have these parts and are willing to sell them, please
email me directly at ericb@microsoft.com.

Thanks,

    Eric

Howday,
We have a 74 911 that we autocross & just won a set of 22mm front adjustable
sway bars to replace
the 19mm stock ones. ( Thanks Automotion for the door prize)
So far we have lowered the car some and put in steering rack spacers and
Turbo tie rod ends.
We run 7" rims and 205x50 tires Yoko A008 tires. In this part of the world
this puts us
in the first level of modified class. We can change to adjustable sway bars
and add a shock
tower brace and adjustable rear spring plates. We can not change the torsion
bars.
The question is:
 Should (must) we replace the stock 19mm rear sway bars with 22mm to match
the
front or is this not important?
 Any great benefit from the shock tower brace and the rear adjustabel sping
plates?

Thanks for you opinions.

My '86 951 cruise failed (became erratic).  When I replaced it, the 
[used] replacement box also had the aspect you noticed: Pushing the 
lever accelerated the car; releasing it "hiccuped", that is, dropped 
the throttle and then picked it back up.

Normally with your symptom I'd suggest checking the steering column 
control and related wiring, but given my symptom too I'd think it was 
the box itself.  In any event, testing the column switch is free but 
replacing the box isn't, so that might be some guidance!

Also check that your clutch and brake pedal sensor switches are operational.

I had this same leak on an '83.  Solved it by selling the car.

I examined everthing very carefully too, and never found anything 
obvious.  Tightened all the hardware to no avail.

You must use the correct, original-type clamps for one thing - standard 
clamps don't seal well in some situations.  Maybe try "gooping" 
everything too with a sealer.

Sorry I couldn't be more helpful, but it's an ugly problem!  Maybe 
compress some colored, insert gas in the filler and see where it comes out.

If the symptom is common to all gauges, then so is the problem & 
solution (probably...  ;-) ).  Find the common grounding point for all 
the brown wires under the dash.  Check that the connection is very 
clean and bright copper colored.  Same for all terminals connected to 
that point.

Also check any common switched +12 VDC lines coming into the cluster, 
as many gauges have a constant hot feed and a variable ground 
connection through their sensor.

Next, check the connector on the instrument cluster itself - bad 
contacts, dirty, loose, etc.

Special equipment & techniques are *required*.  The silica within the

Get someone who's very experienced in this technique!

With a 1984, you may well have to do a lot of work down under.  I would 
*absolutely* pull the engine to enable complete access and bearing 
inspection & replacement.  It's a big job but well, well worth it.  
Then again, this assumes you'll be keeping the car and want to take 
very good care of it.

Plan on spending some serious money and finding stuff you hadn't 
planned on.  I'd be willing to wager that #3 isn't the only problem...

> The responses

[...]

I just saw your message!  Amongst the many failures I've had on my '86 
951, I can render experience on 2 rack failures due to leaks.

In both cases, the end seals gave out, dumping fluid into the bellows 
at each rack end.  You can drive the car w/o fluid if you disconnect 
the power pump by removing the belt.  (This is easy to do and in fact 
is how I got home from a track event last summer.  But you'll want 
strong upper arms before driving the car this way!).

One mechanic suggested that the failure was caused by the rack getting 
microscopic pitting through time [and winter storage???].  Those pits 
tear at the seal, which has around 1500 psi behind it, so it leaks 
quite handily.

The first rack lasted 6 years.  The replacement rack was reconditioned 
by a Pano advertiser, but I don't think they polished that rack - they 
just popped new seals in and wham they're done.  So it only lasted 1 
year.  This gives credence to the pitting theory above (but no 
scientific evidence).

The next rack will be new, via the aftermarket to ZF.  New racks 
through PCNA are $1600 or so these days.

So, best bet is to replace the rack.  It's gonna fail sooner or later.  
Just be wary of rebuilt racks.

I had a "gas leak" in my '75 911.  I was autocrossing, and after 
every run I would notice a smell of gasoline in the car.  This was 
obviously rather disturbing.  I looked all over between runs for 
dripping, smelled under the car, in the boot, etc..

Turned out that the cork gasket in the gas-cap was getting old and
compressed.  Whenever the gas would slosh up the filler neck in hard
cornering, it would leak out around the cap.  I just turned over the
cork (temporary fix...) and went back to racing with no more stench.  

This is a cheap thing to fix...

Yeah, I like the part in the instructions that says "lowering the engine
may be required for installation".  I just went ahead and drilled the
hole and then duct-taped the plastic pour spout of my 2 gallon gas
conatiner onto the end of my shop vac hose and used this contraption
to suck all of the shavings out of the lower portion of the airbox.  Call
me an idiot (figuratively speaking of course - it would cost me a 
fortune to download that many email responses), but it seemed to
work OK.

BTW, an airbox can be pulled without pulling the engine.  I didn't think
so, but a shop I hang around every once and a while did it on a '77.

Good luck!

I had this done on the 4-spoke steering wheel and shift knob of my '86 951.
The

see
gaps where they cut away original leather and replaced it. Ugly and
noticeable
at a glance. More driving pulls the gaps apart. Perhaps, if it had been glued

Hmmm, I'm almost tempted to take this as a testimonial in *favor* of
Bursch on cars with closed-loop fuel systems.  

Reasoning: Bosch 911 MFI is a totally open loop system; from throttle
position and engine RPM it derives engine airflow (carved into its
internal space cam) and thus knows how much gas to inject.  The space
cam is specific to the engine airflow characteristics (volumetric
efficiency) and depends, among many other things, on the exhaust flow.
Sounds to me like the Bursch flows a little more air between 2700 and
3400, allowing better cylinder filling; your MFI unit, not knowing about
the new muffler, keeps injecting the same old amount of gas.  Result: a
lean spot.

On any car with an air flow sensor (carbs, flappers, hot wires, MAP
sensors), this extra airflow would be detected and extra gas would be
injected.  Presumed result: a little extra torque between 2700 and 3400
rpm, or whatever rpm band the extra flow was in.  'Course, there might
be *less* flow in some other rpm band... the laws of physics tend to be
like that, I don't know any specifics in this case.

Anybody had a Bursch muffler on a dyno and care to comment?  I know
Pressler has dyno curves for *his* modified mufflers...

2) Buy a car that runs as apposed to one that doesn't.  A cheap non

Subject: Snow chains for 944 Turbo??


I'm considering buying snow chains to keep on hand in my 944 Turbo.
I have stock tires on the car: 205/55 in front and 225/50 in back.

The owner's manual says that with the large tires I have on the rear
(drive) wheels, "the snow chains must be tensioned and retensioned
with the utmost care, to insure [sic] unimpeded rotation."

That doesn't sound encouraging to someone like me who knows
nothing about (1) selecting or (2) installing snow chains. 
Should I just make darn sure that I always take the Subaru
when I head for the mountains any time between September and
April, or is there hope for me learning to install chains
without scraping the fenders off my 951? 

Should I investigate some alternative to traditional chains, 
such as those new thingies that consist of spiky plastic strips 
attached to a central piece that snaps into the wheel cover? 
Maybe those stick out just as far from the tire as do regular 
chains, though. Any ideas?

Having just opened and closed my 944 engine, I also noticed some ground up
timing belt. The culprit: the camshaft aluminum cover. This is the part
that is behind the distributor.

You must remove the distributor, the upper plastic timing cover and the by
undoing 3 bolts, the aluminum cover will come off. I found that there was
a strenghtenning rib that was making contact with the belt. The cover was
shinny from the rubbing. Got my Dremel out and ground it up a bit. Should
be ok now. 

Might pay to check yours. I'm also using a Zim's belt. Hope this helps!

Thanks everyone that followed up my questions,

It is nice to get feedback, and I've (almost) decided to either rent a 
'real' spot welder when I'm replacing my next floor, or use the MIG and 
'premade holes method'. 
The biggest advantage for me would be the electrical spot welder, as I 
mostly work alone in the garage it is a big plus to have a welder that put 
pressure on both panels as I weld. 
I've not come around to buying a new (ESAB150) MIG/MAG either, Christmas got 
to expensive :-) or is that :-(
It's on the list together with a new spot welder though.

I do like the looks of the Eastwood sets, seem to have the 'right' design, 
but I might stick to Stahlwille tools. I can get the Stahlwille Body 
'bumper' starter kit for about $175 and might go for that, it has very good 
reputation over here.

Time to go home and 'bump',   (..metal!)

       Pete, the spotwelder I saw for sale -is- the Miller "Autoarc spot
      Welder", available on sale for $358 (normal price is $385, Eastwood
     price is the retail of $499) including 12" tongs. Its available from
     "Autobody Toolmart" (800-382-1200) under the stock number 2780. They
     also have the other accessory tongs available. Runs off 115 volts
     directly
        I just got a catalog from these guys a couple weeks ago, they cater
     to body shops (not to home restorers like Eastwood does) and carry 
     a very wide range of products, from cheap wrench sets and hammers 
     to car lifts to paint booths to frame machines...their prices seem
     very reasonable.                    

        One thing I'll say for Eastwood is that they do a pretty good job
     educating you with their catalog alone. Their prices are high (i.e. 
     repackage Krylon and sell it for twice as much) but kind of in line
     with the "tool boutique" and 6 color catalogs a year format.
        Plus, where else you gonna find that English wheel ??

Dear Patty:

Re tire chains for 944:

A really bad idea to put chains on tires that size. I can only imagine the
havoc that would result if one of those bad boys came loose.
A much better idea is to get a second set of wheels of the minimum size
available (7" all around) and put a set of snow tires on, all around.
BTW stay off the boost (g)  if you drive in the snow. With limited slip
you'll be looking out of the side window allot.
I did manage all last winter driving my 944 turbo. It wasn't always fun and I
did resort to the Subaru a few times.

Tom,

I went through the same search and frustration.  I was searching for
a rear mounted bike rack.  One BIG factor ... Do you have a whale tail?
I do.  I ended up modifying a RhodeGear Ultra-3 (I liked the design).
The down tube is long enough to bring the multi-pivot joint above the
tail.  (In fact, I shortened it by 2").  I then created an extra long
horizontal brace out of 3/4" electrical conduit which meets the car at
the base of the rear window.  This replaces the shorter original one.
So far it works just great.  I haven't tried my skis yet.  I'm sure I'll
have to create some sort of modification for them.

If you find roof racks that mount with NO permanent car modifications,
let me know.  I would still like to find/build some.

Note:  My 911 is not only my favorite car, it is my only car.  So, no

Subject: Welding Class

In response to the question from Andrew Kalman,

>I've decided that I need to learn to weld, and I thought a good way to do
>it would be to take a trade/vocational class in the Bay Area (SFO).  

First bit of advice, if you can keep yourself from doing this, **stop now**.
If you need to do only occasional welding, have someone else do it. If you
are about to undertake a major restoration, have your head examined. Welding
puts holes in your body. It has **at least** a temporary effect on your night
vision. I see halos around lights at night for at least a day after welding.
I am sure that as my excellent vision deteriorates naturally with age, I will
always wonder to what extent it is because of the welding. It can produce
noxious fumes. OTOH, it provides a great feeling of accomplishment. On
balance, when I finish my current project, I intend to hang up my helmet.

If you cannot stop yourself, read on. If you are prone to hurt yourself, take
the class or forget it entirely.

My experience in self-teaching MIG welding suggests that no class is
necessary. (no pun intended) Just buy the book at the welding supply shop, (I
will suggest one if you like) some extra material, and have your air chisel
ready. Practice your lap welds, butt welds, and button hole welds, and then
destroy them to observe their strength. If you are restoring a rusty car, be
sure to experiment with partially rusted stock (cut some off the car) to know
what you can get away with. Be sure to do some long segments and observe the
distortion. Follow the directions in the book regarding tacking the work,
preventing heat buildup, and *leaving a root gap* (very important, easy to
forget)

You may need to consult with an experienced welder the first time in order to
learn what the proper sizzle sounds like, and to show you what the basic
welds are. 

Do not hesitate to use the mud dobber method. (short burst of current, watch
metal cool, as the cherry red color dims, another short burst of current) It
requires a lower skill level, and when used with higher current setting can
yeild terrific penetration.(110%) 

Do not underestimate the need for safety equipment. You will set your car on
fire at some point (undercoat, paint,whatever), be ready to put it out. Eye
protection is basic and (I hope) needs no comment. When welding on anything
other than the lowest settings, protect your arms and legs from sunburn. When
working overhead, **wear earplugs**!. That is a sizzle you do not want to
hear, and your garden variety helmet does not adequately protect. I have had
slag land in my outer ear, but was saved by the plugs. Be sure to get a
respirator that fits under your helmet, especially if you will be dealing
with any galvanized replacement panels. Gloves are a must, leather shirt is a
luxury. Spats to cover your ankles are nice, and only about $10. High boots
work as well.

Don't bother with the $200+ automatic helmet, they are for weenies. You will
learn soon enough how to work in the dark, and your eyes may be better
protected. A strong light on the work surface will allow you to see
adequately.

Use 25% Argon, 75% C02 mix. I forget which wire metalurgy, but I can
recommend one if you like. The guys at your supplier can tell you. I prefer
the thin (.024"?) wire for sheet metal.

Good luck, and "feel the burn"

Hi Joe,

My understanding is that most leaks like yours are due to problems with
the four drain hoses that run from the lip of the sunroof opening.  With the
sunroof raised or out, you should be able to make out the four openings,
one at each corner.  All feed white plastic hoses, two running down your
car's A pillars, two running down the C pillars.  The right rear hose also
feeds a T fitting whose other input leg runs from the gas filler drain.

When the hoses fail or become clogged, rain water apparently runs to
the floor.  Not sure the exact route.  I'd start by making sure the hoses
are intact and not clogged.

Hope this helps.

Hi Patty,

Nice to hear from you again.  The caveat probably has to do with the limited
clearance between the outer fender skin and the tires and wheels on 951S',
esp. in light of their 9" rims.  Porsche rolled the fender lip on the 951S 
to get
basic clearance, as it is.

I would guess that if you're faced with snow, you probably aren't driving on
245-wide tires anyways, which should help.

Of course, why someone in San Francisco would even own a set of chains
is an interesting question!

"Turbo" magazine is an excellent source for high tech engine modifications.
There have been two 944S project cars in the last year. Small turbo low end
response and big turbos for high end horsepower is the general rule. However,
variable nozzle and modified air wheels may be availble somewhere if you want
it both ways. More horsepower needs more fuel and air. Consider flow on the
intake side and bigger or additional injectors. How much boost and are you
going to o-ring the head or block? Is such a head gasket available for the 944
turbo? Is the stock intercooler adequate for the horsepower you want? And
remember bring big bucks. High tech horsepower costs big money.

If you don't do the work yourself be sure to get someone with proven
experience with turbos, fuel injection, electronics etc.

release, however, the car acts like the cc didn't engage, and begins slowing
down (if i release the accelerator). exprimentation on deserted roads, however,
 shows that the cc DID engage, it just recorded a 'set' speed about 4mph
 below the speed when the lever was pushed. perhaps this is a related failure?

i haven't debugged this much beyond this stage, since the car is mostly driven
on rallys and short trips, and getting the cc module out of the car

Hi, Mark.
 
Better than sending off a sample, you can probably find an automotive paint
jobber in your area that can mix SEM or DuPont dyes to match your car, on
the spot. These products are sprayed onto the surface, after suitable
cleaning and priming.
 
Even better than having a shop match it and trying to spray it yourself, you
can hire a professional to do it. The cost is very reasonable, they know
what they're doing, and they can probably come to your home to do it. If you
can't find anybody in the yellow pages, ask a higher-end used car dealer who
they have come in to repair their damaged vinyl and leather. Try the used car

Hi, Neil.
 
I looked in my '73 Carrera RS book, and neither Rose Red nor code 4610 are
listed. It is possible that Rose Red is a bad translation of Rosarot, which
is pink by any other name. (As in the famous German Peter Sellers movie
"Der Rosarote Panther" <g>). There is no color chip shown that could be
considered pink by any stretch of the imagination.
 
The book does list a paint code (paint code and color code are different).
The paint code 132 on the plate in your car indicates ivory. That at least
matches what your car has on it/in it now. I don't know what the -9-1 mean.
 
Color name    color code    paint code   paint manufacturer
Ivory          4646          132         Lesonal (Sikkens)
 
While filling out your certificate, could somebody have mis-looked at the
4646 paint code, and written it down as 4610, which is who knows what? Sounds
to me like your car is painted in the original color, if trunk, engine bay,
under dash, under carpet, and paint plate all say ivory.
 
This is one reason I place absolutely no value on those "certificates of
authenticity." You are relying on somebody to hand copy the information from
Porsche's original cardex. The only real source of this information would be
a photocopy of the actual cardex, and Porsche just isn't set up to do that.

Subject: Re: 944 turbo upgrades

Hi Jim,

The problems with increasing the boost pressure in the 944 turbo come 
from head gasket failure. We had some special ones made in Switzerland 
which would allow continuous running at 17 psi boost pressure. They are 
hand made from stainless steel and we fitted them to all of the Porsche 
turbo cup cars in the uk 2 years ago. I have one left @ $300 if you are 
interested.

If you fix that problem a different way, the other thing we found very 
useful was to keep the boost pressure constant. With that particular 
turbo/wastegate setup the boost regulation was very poor and it would 
peak at 4000 RPM and drop way back to 12 PSI at 5500 and over. If you can 
get the boost pressure up at higher RPMs you will get a dramatic increase 
in power. We sell a boost graphic to do it and HKS and others have similar 
things. The problem with changing the turbo is in the lag and the sudden 
onrush of power unsettling the car when it comes in. If most of your 
track work is in a straight line then go for a big one. if not, stay 
small and control it

Patty,

I've got the non-turbo, but the solution I had should work for
almost any car.  

When I run some of those all-night rallies that I've mentioned, there
is often a good chance of snow and ice.  There have even been some
places where they required that chains were carried, but being around
1am, no one was checking.  So, the solution I have used has been to
find a friend with magic chains.  These are chains that have never 
actually been used, but as long as you have them with you, you never
need them. 8-)

Any ideas on tire pressures for snow driving?
Such as higher/lower than normal for good traction?

   Dear Patty:

   Re tire chains for 944:

   A really bad idea to put chains on tires that size. I can only imagine 
the
   havoc that would result if one of those bad boys came loose.
   A much better idea is to get a second set of wheels of the minimum size
   available (7" all around) and put a set of snow tires on, all around.
   BTW stay off the boost (g)  if you drive in the snow. With limited slip
   you'll be looking out of the side window allot.
   I did manage all last winter driving my 944 turbo. It wasn't always fun 
and I
   did resort to the Subaru a few times.

Subject: new underwear...

My morning commute is usually a very unremarkable 10 minute drive down
a 1300 foot hill.  This morning, though, it was, er, much livelier!!

As I approached a 90 degree left turn at the bottom of the steepest
part of the hill, I applied the brakes, practicing my double clutch
downshift with the heel-toe braking (I've been doing that a lot
recently, after the discussions on this list..) and the brake pedal
sank straight to the floor, with no discernible braking whatever!

Pumping had no effect; I rounded the wet corner *way* faster than
usual, but managed to stay on the asphalt (and away from that row of
steel posts on the outside).  On the exit of the turn I realized I was
still upright, and hadn't yet downshifted *or* used the E-brake, so I
did both, and quickly sized up the rest of the drive for its
survivability.

As I limped the rest of the way to work with the E-brake and the
gears, trying to bring my heartrate back into the healthy range, I
thought back to last night... driving home, I did a panic stop at the
bottom of my hill (I do that from time to time when I'm alone on the
road, just to learn the car and test the braking system, and to bring
those long-lost coins out of the seats...). It worked fine; I made a
mental note to adjust my rear drums because they hadn't locked up.

So, at work this AM, my brake fluid in the reservoir is right up to
the top.  I assume my master cylinter is toast, then.  Gee, Automotion
just put them on sale, didn't they! 

Rather an ungraceful failure, don'cha think?  So much for dual brake
circuits...

Grayson,

Where do you come up with these outlandish generalizations??

From what I understand of the AWD system used on the '95 911 C4, it is
likely that for racing purposes, certainly for autox, the RWD '95 911
is the better car.

This means that all us autox and big track guys and gals will probably
prefer the non-C4 version of the car. Does this mean we have ego or
testosterone levels that lead us to think we COULD have an FIA Superlicense?
I don't think so!

Some of us may prefer the traditional RWD for tradition's sake.

So, not all of us are better off with the C4.

Subject: Targa Top Reconstruction


Wayne Michelsen asked for advice about Targa top
rebuilding, and everyone advised having it doe
professionally.  That's one way, sure.  But it
isn't a very hard job to do yourself, saves money,
and provides some inner satisfaction.  I posted
the following a while back.  (Wayne-It might be
helpful.  And to answer your question about what
glue to use for the seals, 3M Weatherstrip
adhesive is about the best.)

I didn't get an overwhelming response to my question about hinks 
and kinks for Targa Top redos.   Perhaps few tackle it for fear of the 
unknown.  My experience might help.

I completely tore down, cleaned, repainted and installed a new top 
and headliner this weekend.  It wasn't hard, and it came out fine.  It 
looks brand new, and fits on the car beautifully.  

I don't think there's any real trick to it.  Just go slowly and carefully 
and pay attention to how the old one was put together.  There's really 
only one aspect to reassembly that I would offer advice on, and it has 
to do with reattaching the "floating" plates by strips of webbing (I 
used seatbelt material, obtainable cheap from most fabric stores.) so 
as to get them spaced properly.  It's easy to do and easy to explain, 
but a pain to write out, especially if no one is interested.  If you really 
want my advice...let me know and I'll either write it out an e-mail 
version of draw a diagram and mail it to you.

If your top isn't in terrible shape, you probably won't have to redo the 
webbing.  Mine top was a disaster.  I'm sure it was the original 22 
yearold top, which the previous owner had covered liberally with 
gobs of silicon seal in a valiant effort to stem the leaks.  The headliner 
would more aptly have been called a head hanger, because it wasn't 
lining anything anymore.  Even the half roll of duct tape (applied by 
the previous owner, natch) wasn't enough to hold it all on.

Subject: RE: cam belt rubbing

There was a post recently about a belt whose excessive wear was
discovered during a water pump replacement. Well, if the water pump
was not turning as freely as it is supposed to, that would certainly put
additional stress on the drive teeth. There have also been a couple
of posts about belts rubbing on the housing. This simply should not
happen unless one of two things are incorrect: the tension or  the
rotation of the tightening idler. Some mechanics claim they can tighten
these belts without the special adjustment gauge. Always use the
gauge to do the tensioning (at least through the 86 model year on
the 944, a self adjuster was introduced in '87). Also, the idler pulley
that sets the tension can be rotated the wrong way which will result
in possible belt rubbing. If my memory serves me, it should be rotated
counter-clockwise. Nonetheless, it is pretty easy to see which way to
rotate it so that the belt is farthest from the housing. Ditto for the balance
shafts belt tensioning idler.

Go for it!  Taking European delivery of a Porsche is one of life's great
experiences.  Not only do you get to drive your brand new Porsche whil on
vacation, you also get to:
1.  Visit the Porsche Museum
2. Get a tour of the factory.
3. Drive the autobahn, at speeds the Porsche understands very nicely!
4. Save enough $$ on the purchase to cover the cost of the trip.

We did it for the first time in 1990, and this is the only way we will ever
take delivery on another Porsche.  There is a lot more territory to explore
in Europe in a Porsche.  Many of our friends have gone this route also, and
love it!

You can make all the arrangements through the Porsche dealer of your choice -
they are very familiar with this program.

Good luck, and enjoy!

Subject: 928 won't start

Time to tap into the collective wisdom of this group.  My '86 928
won't start.  The cars been fine since I got it in August.  I backed
it out of the garage last weekend to clean the garage and when I
started it about 4 hrs later to put it back in the garage it ran
like s**t (wasn't running on all 8 cylinders).  I turned it off and
tried to restart it (on the off chance that ignition system was in
a weird state) with no success.  (Fortunately none of my neighbors
saw my pushing it back into the garage. :-)  The car just rolled over
60K miles and needs the 60K service.

The starter motor cranks, and the fuel pump sounds like it is running,
but no go.  I don't have any service manuals, but thought I'd try to
check out the obvious stuff before dragging it off to my local
mechanic.  Trouble is, I'm not sure what all the obvious stuff might
be (which is why I'm here).  I'm planning on doing the following this
weekend:

    1) double check that the fuel pump is running (besides listening
       back by the right rear wheel is there a better way)

    2) check fuses/relays

    3) pop the hood and poke around

    any other ideas?

Is there a safe way to verify that I'm getting a spark?  I seem to
remember something about not firing the ignition without a load or
you could damage it.

Any of you 928 owners run into similar symptoms?  If so what fixed
it?

Only one of the two windscreen washer jets was functional on my 944,

opening under pump pressure as it should. I carefully pulled it apart.
Of course there was a tiny little spring inside that went bouncing off
in some unknown direction. After a few minutes on my hands and knees
with a flashlight I found it. I then examined the innards of the valve. It
appeared that the rubber gasket had expanded to the point that it
was sealing around the circumference of the valve. It is only supposed
to seal against the inlet at the end, so I trimmed about a mm off of
the circumference of this gasket with a pair of scissors. After
reassembly, the washer system works great!

Good luck!

Savings are usually substantial - savings off the purchase price that is. 
 Well,
I guess [bank] savings may also be substantial, at lease prior to purchase.
Temporary insurance coverage while in Europe can be steep.

Actually, most [if not ALL] European auto manufacturers offer programs of 
this nature.
I also bought a Volvo this way and I know Saab offers it as well and have

First bit of advice, if you can keep yourself from doing this, **stop now**.
If you need to do only occasional welding, have someone else do it. If you
are about to undertake a major restoration, have your head examined. Welding
puts holes in your body. It has **at least** a temporary effect on your 
night
vision. I see halos around lights at night for at least a day after welding.
I am sure that as my excellent vision deteriorates naturally with age, I 
will
always wonder to what extent it is because of the welding. It can produce
noxious fumes. OTOH, it provides a great feeling of accomplishment. On
balance, when I finish my current project, I intend to hang up my helmet.

forget)

learn what the proper sizzle sounds like, and to show you what the basic
welds are.

Do not hesitate to use the mud dobber method. (short burst of current, watch
metal cool, as the cherry red color dims, another short burst of current) It
requires a lower skill level, and when used with higher current setting can
yeild terrific penetration.(110%)

Do not underestimate the need for safety equipment. You will set your car on
fire at some point (undercoat, paint,whatever), be ready to put it out. Eye
protection is basic and (I hope) needs no comment. When welding on anything
other than the lowest settings, protect your arms and legs from sunburn. 
When
working overhead, **wear earplugs**!. That is a sizzle you do not want to
hear, and your garden variety helmet does not adequately protect. I have had
slag land in my outer ear, but was saved by the plugs. Be sure to get a
respirator that fits under your helmet, especially if you will be dealing
with any galvanized replacement panels. Gloves are a must, leather shirt is 
a
luxury. Spats to cover your ankles are nice, and only about $10. High boots
work as well.

==
==  Yeah, and shoe spats are a cool idea.  I have gotten slag down my

==  Makes me dance the jig when it happens.

Don't bother with the $200+ automatic helmet, they are for weenies. You will
learn soon enough how to work in the dark, and your eyes may be better
protected. A strong light on the work surface will allow you to see
adequately.

==  Do the golden shade thing, it makes a difference in the outcome.

Use 25% Argon, 75% C02 mix. I forget which wire metalurgy, but I can
recommend one if you like. The guys at your supplier can tell you. I prefer
the thin (.024"?) wire for sheet metal.

Any chance that the wiper is merely frozen to the rear hatch?  You may have
to pull the wiper blade loose prior to activating the wiper.

Have you checked the circuitry to the motor assembly?  Using a test light
would be quite simple, since the circuit is quite simple.

If it is neither of those two possibilities, then the wiper assembly needs
replacement.

When I bought my 914, it had something like that mounted on it.  It had two parts:  one mounted

A battery can show full charge, and not deliver current.  One way for
a battery to fail is for the internal resistance to be too high.

Measure the "cranking" voltage at both the battery and the starter.  It
should be in the range of 8-9 volts.

   If bad at battery, replace it.
   If OK at battery, and bad at starter, suspect wiring.

Be sure to check the ground strap at the rear of the transmission!  (And
both battery connections...)

Adjusting the alternator belt is a two person job.  Half the work is done
from below, half from above.  There's a plastic cover over the access hole,
I guess that you've found that already.

Of all the work I've done to the 914, adjusting the belt was the most
frustrating.  (Working on a 914 teaches patience.)

The Mohn ski rack for the 914 mounted to the underside of the rool bar 
on the drivers side and the other piece mounted to the tow hook mount in 
the rear bumper.

I to threw mine away long ago. Did use it once to go to sun Valley many 
years ago. Also forgot to change the oil to 10-30 still had the 20-50 in 
it and had to push start it everytime.

Tom,

I used Thule's a couple of times on my Targa.  Yes, they fit in the little
rain gutter.  No, I didn't feel super secure cruising down the highway with
bikes on the roof.  You'd be amazed at the increase in peripheral vision
acuity - you notice every little wiggle of the Targa top, sure that your
bikes are about to appear in your rear-view mirror.

Maybe I'm exagerating slightly.  It also depends on the what kind of bike.
Mountain bikes are heavier, and probably have a higher drag coefficient.  A
road bike doesn't cause as much excitement.  I'd probably use one that
hangs off the back.

Yup, my '83 928 is the same exact way. So I need to run it up to about
75 to set it at 70.  Sometimes, I'll set the CC and then a few minutes
later I'll ask myself why am I going so slow? Look down and I'm going
5-10 mph slower than what it was set for. I'll reset it. Then notice
that it will slowly drop the speed about 1 mph per minute!  Could this
be a vacuum leak?

FYI:
A few years ago the cruise did not work at all and the vents were not
operating properly. I traced this down to a bad vacuum check valve
located near the master cylinder. This works out to be a $70 part
because you get all the vacuum lines with it. After installation (just
the check valve: the hoses went every where) the vents and cruise work
just fine.

I've never had any problems adjusting the 914-4's belt. This is my sequence:

  1) from underneath car, loosen pivot nut
  2) from inside engine compartment, remove both plastic "covers". Put a
14mm open-end wrench  through the cover onto the square nut, and put a 6m
(?) allen key on the bolt head.  Immobilize the nut with the wrench, and
loosen it with the Allen key.  Push down _hard_ on the 14mm wrench (but
don't twist the nut - you'll need a strong wrist) and re-tighten the Allen
key.  Check tension, and replace covers.
  3) Re-tighten lower nut.

Works every time, takes about 5 minutes.  I use a 1/2" socket wrench with
an Allen-key "socket" to make it easier.

I don't know, Patrick, but the idea of having the rear window of a Type I

was lucky if the front window defrosted. Seriously, though, the stock

Hi All,

        Seeing as how people are on the topic of 914 heater etc...

        With the onset of the rain and winter here, I have been noticing
the horible inefectiveness of my 914s' defroster/defoger. I have only
owned this car for a little over 7 months. But have already dropped the
engine a number of times to do extensive replacement of old/broken parts.
So my question is: Do the 914s simply have a really inefective system? Or
is there possibly something wrong? The heater by itself works great. But
the window keeps fogging up. It's really bad in the rain...


        On an unrelated note: For those of you that have experience with
transmissions, I finnaly have a fresh rebuild installed (long tale of
frustration ommited) and the only complaint/observation I have is that
there is a fairly noticable dry grating sound when I'm engine braking. It's
not there when I'm on the gas, and it canges with RPM. The pinion whine in
the higher gears is there too, but that I'm under the impression is simply
the result of an older ring & pinion and that it is not a problem. I know
the pinion is good as I had the oportunity to inspect it before it was
reasembled. So is this dry grating/rattle sound normal? I was told that I
should expext to hear some "gear lash" but this for some reason just doesn'
t sound right.

        Secondly, does anybodyout there have experience with the Poly
transmission mounts (e.g. automotion). And is it normal for them to loosen
after first instalation, and for the sides to bulge slightly when tightened
down?

Thanks...

Alright, so I'm an idiot.  I forgot to mention that the subject was *914* 
heat exchangers and that Mr. Morton's question (you'll have to backtrack if 
you want it) was about coatings to *protect* them from the elements.  In 
that respect, I stand by what I said: the cost of coating the parts 
outweighs the purpose.

I certainly hope that no offense was taken from my comments.  I have no 
reason to suspect the quality of the Jet-Hot product (if I had, I wouldn't 
have sent for the info).

BTW, it occurred to me that the coating, by removing heat from the exhaust 
system more quickly, might reduce the amount of heat available for the 
heating system.  Is this unreasonable?

Subject: More cruise control (944, 928)

To those with cruise missiles --

To catch up . . .  There have been a few posts, some about 944's some about 
928's and the cruise control failing either to "catch" or to hold.

It has been suggested that it could be a vacuum-related problem.  I doubt 
this (in spite of one person's experience -- sorry :-o ) in the case of a 
failure to hold since a vacuum leak would cause a gradual speed decrease 
which the cruise control would attempt to correct by routing more vacuum to 
the system.  I think the symptom in such a case would be similar to 
"bucking".  It could, however, be the problem for those that fail to catch 
initially.  If there isn't any vacuum available there is no way the actuator 
can do it's job.

The system's failure to set at the speed you want could be because the 
amplifier isn't "trimmed" properly.  It is possible to change the resistors 
that "trim" the appropriate circuit, but I doubt it is worth the effort.

Finally, to Jim who has the idea of finding which component has gone bad:  
Good luck.  I couldn't understand everything for M-B cruise system even with 
a complete description of all the circuits and components.  What I learned 
was "Let the pro's handle it."

Defrosting in a 914 is mediocure at best I always carry a towel with me.
One thing that will help is to use a lot of outside air to defrost with. 
slide all the levers to the right for defrosting. Once your are either 
frozen or defrosted then start moving the levers back to the left.

Sounds like a bushing or bearing. Trans should not make any grating

These should not losen if you used nylock type nuts. You don't need a

Here is the latest on the BFG Tires.

			mike

Mike:

Yes They did discontinued the Autocross tires.

I'm sure you are aware that BFG has two competition tires, one for 
autocrossing (226's); and one for Road Racing (230's). The main 
difference between the two is that the 226's have a softer compound than 
the 230's, and the casing on the 230's is just a little stiffer than the 
226's. BFG thinks, and I have to agree with them, that the 230's are a 
very competitive tire. 

Dwight said he has a handling problem with the 230's because of the 
stiff casing and that the 911's are a little light in the front. 
Apparently, the car will intend to push a quite a bit because the tire 
won't bite enough with the stiff sidewalls. I have to agree with Dwight 
because I kinda remember when the Yokohama RTU's first came out the 
sidewall was extremely stiffed and they wouldn't work very well on my 
914. I think the Mid & Rear engine cars are going to have a problem the 
230's.

Later Mike!!

The last time I remember them reviewing a 944, one of their complaints was
something along the lines of lack of rear passenger space or luggage
capacity or somesuch.  Consumer reports is okay when they stick to items
in the 'mid-range' whether it be stereos or automobiles, but they have no
concept of the specialty markets.  They seem to exist for those people
with 2.4 children, etc.  (Hey, that .4 kid would fit great in the rear
seats of a Porsche! - the other two could take the 914 - the perfect
family autocross vacation!)  Wonder if they reviewed the towing capacity
of the 914?

I think their profit it minimal, as they basically act only as order takers
for the factory, which of course makes its profit. But I understand that
cars sold on European delivery also don't count toward the dealer's
allocation, if any. (In recent years, using up your allocation wasn't a
problem for Porsche dealers :-)  )
 
This may be why the Boxster will allegedly not be offered for Euro delivery
at first -- they figure demand will be high, so they will be able to sell
all of the cars marked for USA and RestOfWorld at full dealer price or above
right in the showrooms, with no "slack" to be delivered right at the
factory.

Sean, 

The price to have John recover your leather Steering wheel would depend on

The Steering wheel on the '70 911E is the early 4 spoke design.

Dear Porsche fellows,


I have an 85.1/2 944 which I got about 2 months ago, with 
66K miles. The car has been fine so far. 
I would like to get your feedbacks on two issues :

1-) For those of you who live in DC area, I need your
    recommendations for a competent, reasonably priced
    mechanic, preferably in No. VA for timing belt 
    replacement and general check-up. 
    What is the typical cost of replacing the belt(s)?

2-) As a minor complaint, when I first start the engine
    (especially in cold wheather) and sometimes when
    idling, the steering wheel shakes and rattles. What
    do you think the problem is ? Is it common with
    944s ? Could it be because of engine mounts ?
    The idling RPM is around 850. After about 1100 RPM,
    it gets much better.

Thanks in advance.

Armagan.

There is no question about it. If you have the extra bucks for the 4wd 
or you just have to buy "all the options", get the 4wd. All others are 
better off with the 2wd. You will never notice the difference.
	Amazing how easy it is to generalize on these things :-).
	Seriously, driving a 2wd in a ski resort all winter, the only 
things I am giving up over my 4wd sport-ute is using engine braking 
going down very steep, very slippery hills and not going around corners 
on slippery roads quite as fast because of understeer (which I suspect 
would be a problem with the 4wd, too, since it is mostly a factor of the 
light front end and the 4wd is not that much better weight 
distribution-wise). When snow is gone, of if you do not have snow, I can 
see no practical difference. Why add weight and cost when it is not 
needed (new models gain weight almost every year anyway, without 
optioning it on).

My problem may seem strange to air cooled engine boys, but my 944 puts out
too much cabin heat! With the temperature control set almost off, the heater
still pumps out lots of hot air and keeps going until you need to open the
windows! When the car is cold it will pump heat even in the full off
position. I hear the sensor clicking on and off (behind the dash) so I know
it's cycling. This unit, which samples the air temp. was just replaced. It
seems as through the temperature control is out of calibration but I'm told
it's not adjustable.  By the way, the heated air is not blended and I'm
wondering if this is normal? The heat and a/c control panel has also been
replaced.  If there is a way to calibrate the temp. control or if the heated
air should be blended or if this is the way an automatic climate control
system works, your help will be appreciated.

Subject: G-50 in place of 915?

Hello fellow Porschephiles,
    I have a 1983 911 SC and just lost second gear the other day (the
transmission will not shift into second; it seems like something is blocking
my efforts to get it into that).  The other gears work perfectly though. I've
spoke to a few Porsche mechanics and friends who say that the synchro
probably went bad.  I was wondering whether anyone knows if it is possible
for me to replace the stock 915 transmission with the newer G-50 transmission
(since I was told that these were more reliable).  If not, how hard is it to
rebuild the 915 transmission?  I've rebuilt the Borg and Warner T-5
transmission twice on my Ford Mustang (which was pretty straightforward),
so I have some knowledge of rebuilding transmissions, but don't know
if the Porsche transmissions are as easy to rebuild.  Thanks in advance
for any input.                            Gene

I am rebuilding an '86 930. The engine has been twin-plugged with an
Electromotive Crank-Fire Ignition, and has a K-27 turbo and a very large
Andial Intercooler. Apparently the previous owner made all the external
mods he could afford. Now that we have the engine dissambled (he hit a
valve with a piston... the rest is history) what are the relative costs
and benefits of regrinding the stock cams and/or porting the 32 mm intakes
(to 36 mm?) We have a shop here who has "done" the porting, but it was
perhaps a shotgun approach.  Even I have to admit I've probably got enough
HP... but then again... The car has 285/40-15's on the rear that should
reduce the effective gearing by about 5% and be very quick. The rear 
sway bar was missing when we received the car. Any suggestions on an 
other than stock unit? Depending on the higher speed stability of the 
285's, I may go back to the stock tires/wheels. This car will be driven
daily, weather permitting, so I don't want to mess up the
streetability. (I have a 914/6 for autocrossing!) Comments appreciated!

Hi, Gary,

Your problem is most likely the AC control.  

No way to fix them.

New ones are around 600, used for around 200.

Borrow a friend's unit to check before you buy.

	944s like 924s and VWs have the same type of problem in the 
steering column.  After some time the bearing in the part of the column 
that also houses the ignition switch becomes worn and loose thus causing 
the steering wheel to vibrate whenever the car will.  Fortunatly its easy 
to fix.  All you need to do is remove the steering wheel, the ignition 
and wiper harnesses and the allen head bolt that holds the housing in 
place and it will slide off by hand.  If you lack the proper equipment 
for the job you might want to take it to someone with a press to do the 
bearing swap.  

	Hope this helps.

Bob:

I successfully updated my '73T to '79 sport seats last year.  Really was a
simple changeover, and an opportunity to get rid of rusty 20 year old
fasteners.

Bought a set of adapters from Automotion- not particularly cheap, but well
made and very strong!  I think they were about $190, but they have somany
discount sales, you can easily save some bucks if you time it.

Refinished all existing rails, and replaced all fasteners with non-factory
grade 12 (I want the seats to stay put if I ever get clobbered).  If you're
careful, you can remove the seatbelt latches from the old living room sytle
seats, and position them properly on the new seats - this will work, but may
want to go ahead and update to newer belts and use the correct latches.

The whole thing works just fine, and it's such a pleasure to drive with seats
that firmly lock my wide posterior in place.  They may not be proper for a
concours car, but I already have one of those that never gets driven anymore.
 I get to enjoy this Porsche!

You can buy new plug-ends and connect them up to your wires after removing the 
original plug-end (what you call the receptacle).  This is a common failure 
because the heat of the engine makes the plug-ends (and rubber boots) brittle 
and then sometimes they crack the next time you pull on them to change a spark 
plug.

Well, I am renovating the interior of my 83SC, and have determined that you can
do all the stripping and prep work yourself, but it is better to leave it to
the experts to do the final repairs/tinting. 

The leather in my car have been tinted after the driver seat bolsters have been
repaired quite a few years back. He tinted the all the leather inside the car,
including turning the back shelf into a tan color instead of the standard
black. When I got the car, the tint was all dry and flaking off. I took the 
back shelf to a good local leather specialist. She told me that they used a 
inapproriate laqueur based tint on the leather. She told me to strip all the
inside with laquer thinner. I took all the panels out of the car (doors, 1/4
panels, seats, rear seats...) and stripped them all. Quite a trip from the
fumes. After that, I took all the parts down to her, and she is presently 
finishing the detailing and starting the retinting. Should look like new, and
total cost ~450 CND ( $350 US).

No leather was bad enough to warrant replacement, it just looked ragged and rought
until I stripped it...it was quite nice to see baby-bottom soft leather appear 
from under all that rough sandpaper texture leather..

satisfaction.  If it does check to see if the small electrical "adaptor" 
is still attached to the plug on the affected cylinder.  If not, find it!

If the rubber end on the spark plug connector is damaged replace it.

If the plastic portion of the connector is damaged I would replace the 
connector after a resistance check is made to see if it is out of 
tolerance as well as damaged.  I have used connectors with chipped ends 
as long as they held the rubber insulaters.  Remember to check the 
resistance of the connector

The starter is a brush-style DC motor.  Turn the motor slowly while checking
the resistance, looking for an open or shorted winding.

35 ohms is a good resistance for a winding.  I'm guessing that you have
one shorted winding, which is making the motor heat up and die.

The motor can be rebuild (rewound), which is cheaper than replacing.  It's
not that different from a "bug" starter, so you should be able to find
a shop pretty easily.  (George gets $55.00 for a used starter.)

What I would do is go to a "you-pull-it" junk yard and snag one from
a VW type-IV (411 square-back, or newer bus).

Hope this helps,

Subject: 928 Cruise Control Problems

Hi,
Since there is not really a very extensive data base representation for
928s on the list, I will add one more data point on the question of
cruise control abberations on this model.  My 928S is also afflicted
with the problem.  Every once in a while I find the speed dropping from
the set point or not returning to the point after I hyave applied the
brakes, for example.  This problem seems to be sporadic, and I have
been unable to relate it to anything I or the car have done.
Just my $0.02.

Subject: Re: '89 944 heater

Gary,

I would start by checking the operation of your heater valve.  It is
a valve run by a vacuum diaphragm, and its job is to open and close
the flow of coolant through the heater core.  On your car, it is
probably at the back of the engine, spliced into the hose which
runs between the heat pipe next to the block, and the heater core
nipple on the firewall.

On the sixteen valve cars, the valve is next to the oil filter,
spliced into the hose running between the front end of the heat
pipe and the water pump.  These valves are a common failure item.

With the engine running and at temp, have a friend move the temp
control knob from lock to lock (so to speak).  You should see the
lever arm of the heater valve move from open to shut.  If it does
not move, it may be a bad valve or it may be that it is not getting
the right vacuum "signal."

If you are getting blasted with hot air all the time, I would
suspect the valve before suspecting the mixer flap.  However, that
might be something to check next.  I would also make sure that
the cabin temp sensor (behind the grill in the dash) is hooked up
and working right.

May well be the spark but unlikely, you can easy check the spark by 
getting a spare plug, unplugging a lead and attaching it to the spare 
plug, lay the plug on top of the engine, and turn the engine over a few 
times.

Could well be water in the tank, was it stored nearly full or nearly 
empty. 

If the tank was left part full, each time the car warms up, air is 
expelled via the breather, when it cools at night damp air is drawn into 
the tank where the water vapor condenses on the cold metal, running down 
to the bottom of the tank. Over several months it is possible to get 
several pints in the tank in this way.

Water being 1.25 times as heavy as gas always stays at the bottom, and 
does not get into the fuel lines until you start the car. After a few 
secs it gets drawn into the injectors and glug glug clonk.

The solution is clamber under the car with an old plastic bowl, loosen a 
fuel line from the pump (standard discaimer about smoking, eyes etc) and 
drain out a quart or so. decant it into a glass jar and then look to see 
if any water is present.


If you find any water, keep draing until you get no more water. You can 
pour most of the gas back into the tank.

Are you sure about this 35 ohms, this would imply that the starter will 
only draw arout .3 amp - hey we don't need batteries any more

the 35 ohms is probably the resistance of the starter solenoid, although 
that seems low.

35 ohms across the starter itself is likely to mean that one or both 
brushes is worn so much that it no longer contacts the stator

Subject: why did I ask that dumb question


recall around 3 weeks back I asked if any one out there had experienced 
944 farting after you leave the car, well as a result there has been some 
consersation on the subject.

Well when I raised the question I didn't have a problem, it was really 
just "as a mater of interest", well I seam to have stirred up the dreaded 
demons because it has now developed the full monty (UK expression - 
probably equates to something like the full cassius clays)

Taking the daughter to a riding lesson this afternoon, along a narrow 
winding road, criusing at 55 suddenly no power - tacho instantly reads 
zero volts, luckily I managed to swing into a pub car park, from where I 
called the commander, who agreed to bring our trusted ford to tow me 
home, she arrived, but not in the expected ford but in mans renault, 
strange I thought. She had broken down on the way - clutch cable snapped 
at a busy junction. So the man in the renault gives us a lift back to the 
ford ( it has had a history of breaking cables I had a spare in the troot)

I then repaired the ford and we went back to the 944 - complete with tow 
rope, of course you've guessed, it started first go, and showed no sign 
of the problem on the way home
 
Now the big question - will it get me to work tomorrow and what is wrong 
with it.

Techy bits now - it must have capacitive discharge ignition, where the 
devil is it, the haynes is useless.

Where does the CD set take it's timing pulse from?

Thanks for help in advance.

Subject: Blinker Problem-the last chapter

Hi,

I'd like to thank all those who responded to my problem with my turn signal
switch. I still haven't solved my problem, but I  noticed something new while
working on the car today. When I turned off the ignition with the turn signal
stalk in EITHER the left or right position, the RIGHT side turn signals
(parking lights) light up  at an intensity 2-3 times brighter than when
blinking. Also, at the begining of the day I noticed that the rear left
signal would also light up, but later on only the right side would light up. 

I have checked just about everything that was suggested. All the ground
returns from the light housings are connected and the master cylinder switch
is working properly. I don't have a rear fog light but the wires that would
connect one are fine and isolated.  All the bulbs are fine. The only thing I
couldn't check was the turn signal switch in the steering column because I
don't have a big enough wrench to get the wheel off.

Can somebody tell me why the left parking lights don't come on, please. I
suspect it's the turn signal switch but if it is not, then it's off to the
mechanic for expensive diagnosis.

Thanks a lot,
Neil Kumpers

Subject: 944, 928 cruise control

P-files:

I've been following the cruise control thread and am interested in knowing
a little more about how the cc system works. My '84 944 experiences the
same symptoms described by Jeff Holt in his original posting and I would
like to fix it. Then all of my car's gadgets will work :) (Except for the
right foglight, of course, which I still have to get around to - does
anyone have a spare?). Once the cruise is fixed, I may even use it once in
awhile - who knows, but for now it's just annoying that it doesn't work.

I bought my car about at a place about four hours away and while driving it
home tried out all the features including the cc. It seemed to have trouble
engaging, but when engaged, seemed to work fine. Shortly after arriving
home, I replaced clutch slave cylinder, water pump, rad, belts, and rebuilt
clutch master after which work the cruise more or less quit completely. I
say more or less because 1. It still accelerates (with usual delay, but
lets go very quickly) when I try to set the cc and 2. Once, during a
highway trip, the cruise worked for awhile (I tried to set it and got
nothing so forgot about it. A little while later, while going up a long
hill, the cruise all of sudden took over - could be that the cruise took
over when I my speed dropped to whatever the cc was actually set to (ala
Jim Harriger's 928 experience, which I will test tomorrow)).

The switches all appear to be working (including clutch and brake, which I
tested during my one opportunity in the mountains). Maybe there's a vacuum
leak which became worse while I was working on the repairs.

A few questions for someone in the know:

1. How does the cc work? I'm very familiar with servo systems, but I'd like
to know what the cruise system's comesinto's and goesoutta's are. How does
the cc system modulate the throttle? In my car, the actuator looks like a
rotary solenoid, but someone mentioned the vacuum system being involved. Is
the cc system documented in the service manuals or is it treated like a
black box? How about troubleshooting it? Is there a general reference on
cruise control? Did Porsche design its own cc system or buy it from someone
else?

2. What else does the car use vacuum for besides cc? (This probably tells
you I know nothing about engines and transmissions - you're pretty much
right, but I'm learning thanks to y'all). What are the symptoms of a vacuum
leak? What vacuum system tests are there? How does one find a vacuum leak?

Subject: Rain and an '84 944

p-files:


On Jan 2, Joseph Malin asked about water in his 944. I asked pretty much
the same question when I first joined the list a few months ago and I kept
the responses in a file. I'll be trying to e-mail the entire file directly
to him.

I received quite a few suggestions and followed up on a few (original
posting attached):

Removed battery to look for rust:
Found absolutely no rust but what *may* have been a water entry point
around the stud that holds the battery clamp. Sealed it using two part
plumber's epoxy (may not have been the best choice, but I had it here so I
used it - plumbers apparently swear by it).

Removed sunroof and checked drain holes by pouring water through:
None were plugged since water came out bottom. I didn't measure the amount
of water that came out vs. the amount I put in, so I suppose some may have
gone astray, but I doubt it.

Then during the Christmas break it rained and rained and rained and my car
just sat there in the rain. (Nice to stay home for a few days, but I'd sure
like to have a garage for my car, foggy windows are a real drag.) I checked
periodically and found a slow accumulation of water on the floor at the
front of the doors. The carpet along the wall in front of the doors was
damp as well. I didn't drive, so the water was not coming in as a result of
driving. I suspect the following two possibilities: leaky door seals (the
passenger side, which leaked the worst had a small fold in its rubber
seal) or a leaky windshield. In my original posting, I noted that the water
accumulated behind the passenger seat. This could still have been a leak at
the front of the car since at the time the front of the car was raised on
jackstands for awhile and the water could have run to the back under the
plastic door sill cover. There's no water behind the seats this time
around, but I did find some there again a few months ago.

Since removing the windshield to re-seal it seems risky (is it?, I'd have
it done) and a new one expensive (how much?), my next step will be to try
and recondition the door seals a little more aggresively than with the
silicon spray I've used in the past. I'm thinking of using D&C's High
Vacuum Grease, which I've heard is supposed to have the right stuff in it
for rubber. Any other suggestions? How much are door seals, anyway?

One of the responses to my original posting spoke of door drains. Where are
they? I looked and only found a small hole at the bottom of the door and
don't see how it could leak into the interior.

Philers!

Over the past week or so with temperature dipping it the single digits, I've
noticed my '87 924S has been difficult to start.

When starting for the first time in the morning, it wont start unless I
slightly depress the gas pedal.  Once it does start it refuses to idle above
500rpm and usually stalls, unless I keep my foot on the pedal, In which case
it seems to be running rich (lots of exhaust smoke and sputtering as I
rev it).

This seems alot like an aux air regultor failure on CIS equipped cars, is
this my problem with the motronic system?

Thanks in Advance!

BUSY IMSA TEST OPENS '95 SPORTS CAR SEASON AT DAYTONA

A BUNCH of cars -- and a number of quick ones -- made the annual
International Motor Sports Association's open test session preparing for
the Feb. 4-5 Rolex 24 At Daytona an exceedingly interesting proposition
on Jan. 7-8 at Daytona International Speedway.

The Exxon World Sports Car track record unofficially took a beating
Sunday as four cars bettered the mark set by Spaniard Fermin Velez in
qualifying for the '94 Rolex 24.

As nearly 50 IMSA cars tested for the season opener, Scandia
Motorsports' two Ferrari 333 SPs set the pace. Velez drove the #3
Ferrari to the fastest lap of the session, 1:43.731, an average speed of
123.550 mph. Italian Formula One driver Michele Alboreto drove the team
car, #33, to a lap of 1:44.510, 122.629.

Also breaking Velez's lap record of 1:45.934, 120.981, was defending WSC
champion Wayne Taylor of Altamonte Springs in the #30 Ferrari, 1:44.767,
122.329; and James Weaver in the #16 Riley & Scott Mk. 3, 1:45.480, 121.502.

The test concludes Monday. A section of the Oldfield Grandstand will be
open, with access through the Visitors' Center.

                              NOTES

* Scandia Motorsports, Pirelli and Ferrari collaborated on a press
conference on Saturday at which team owner Andy Evans announced a
three-year deal whereby Scandia would serve as "exclusive development
team" for Pirelli in IMSA. "With the technical expertise of Ferrari and
Pirelli, we believe Scandia Motorsports now has the potential to win a
championship in 1995," Evans said. He announced the season-long lineup
for one Ferrari 333 SP would be Mauro Baldi and a driver TBA. Michele
Alboreto and Stefan Johansson would partner Baldi at Daytona. The second
car will see Evans and Fermin Velez do the season, with defending Rolex
24 winner Paul Gentilozzi and Robbie Groff at Daytona.

* Tony Southgate, the designer of the 333 SP, spoke at the press
conference of it being "20-odd years since Ferrari had seriously
attempted to win a 24-hour race." At the time of the conference,
he spoke of two completely new cars and one other, Scandia's first
chassis, as being in the garage. Before the test was completed, two more
Ferrari's had joined them -- one '94-spec car that was driven on Sunday
by Massimo Sigala and Fabrizio Barbazza; and the other a '95-spec car
that was frantically being assembled in the paddock on Sunday evening.
"The #3 car has a 24- hour engine," said Southgate, "while the #33 and
the #30 have sprint engines running at low revs, because the engine
shop's trying to get the other engines done. This is not a completely
new car. On the '95 version the most obvious changes are in the bodywork
- -- a new nose for more downforce and less drag; and side panels with
a different oil cooling arrangement, because that was inadequate as
it was. The basic chassis is the same. The biggest difference is the
endurance engine and transmission package." In response to another
question, Southgate simply replied that Ferrari "officially is not going
to Le Mans..."

* Paul Gentilozzi said the Ferrari was obviously much different than the
sedans he was used to driving in both IMSA and the SCCA Trans-Am Series,
but that the car was "surprisingly comfortable and an excellent car to
drive. The engine is very smooth and it revs up quicker than anything
I've driven. I think we can drive it easily and still complete 750 laps,
which I think it will take to win." NOTES

* Michele Alboreto said he was "much more dark in the hair," the last
time he had been to Daytona for a race. "I was here in 1981, with the
Lancia Martini," said Alboreto. "Daytona is one of the most important
races in the world. It would be important to my career to win it."

* Andy Wallace reported that the new Auto Toy Store Chevrolet Spice was
frantically being completed in South Florida, therefore it was not at
the Daytona test. Wallace reported the team hoped to test the car for
the first time at Moroso Motorsports Park in West Palm Beach on Tuesday.
His Daytona teammate and another former Rolex 24 winner, Jan Lammers,
was also on foot at the test.

* Four-time Rolex 24 winner Bob Wollek was effusive in his praise of the
new Porsche World Sports Car, which he briefly tested at Charlotte Motor
Speedway before Christmas. "How can you expect better than to drive a
Porsche and get paid for it," said Wollek, who shared the car with Mario
Andretti and Scott Goodyear. "It's difficult to say how good this car
will be... It's brand-new and hasn't been tested a lot. We'll be able
to tell a lot more by Monday, because there's so little mileage on the
car, now. I've never seen a bad TWR car, or a bad Porsche. (With TWR and
Porsche) working together, I can't see it being a flop. There's too much
experience and know-how; and the ability to react if something's wrong
for it not to be a winner."

* Four-time IMSA GT champion Geoff Brabham arrived on Sunday and was
due to test the Porsche for the first time on Monday. He will share the
second car with Hans Stuck and 1985 Rolex 24 winner Thierry Boutsen.
"It was a bit of a surprise when Porsche called me," said Brabham, "but
it was an opportunity worth taking a chance with. It's nice to join an
effort where nothing's good enough but to win. I have driven a Porsche
before -- I drove a couple races in 1986-87 -- at Mount Fuji in Japan in
a 962."

* Chevron's new World Sports Car, the Ford-powered B71-94, arrived at
the Speedway late on Sunday. Engine builder Ted Wenz was splitting time
between the Chevron and Dyson Racing's Riley & Scott Mk. 3. According to
James Weaver, Dyson's car was "run-in" at Roebling Road Raceway, a club
and testing circuit outside of Savannah, Ga. "We wanted to take care of
all the new-car problems," said Weaver of the car's first runs. Designer
Bob Riley, Bill Riley and Mark Scott were all on hand at Daytona to see
a promising first outing at the "World Center of Racing" for drivers
Dyson, Weaver, Scott Sharp and John Paul Jr.

* Paul Jr. was pleased to report that he would be on hand for the
Rolex 24 -- a race he won in 1982. Team owner Kevin Doran said his
NASCAR SuperTruck program, for which Paul will drive the full season,
is slightly behind schedule, therefore Doran thought it more important
that Paul become committed to drive at Daytona. "I might put a Winston
Cup driver in the truck for Phoenix (Craftsman SuperTruck opener, on
the same weekend as the Rolex 24)," said Doran, who also added he was
seeking sponsorship for the Truck program.

I have the jack pads.  they are ok as long as you make sure you push them
into the jack hole all the way.  otherwise you'll deform the jack hole
and poss the rocker too.  another problem is that since the pad doesn't
rotate it will not be flat on the floor jack as you jack up the car.
i've found that if you put your floor jack parallel to the car instead
of perpendicular it works better.  you'll want a 4" square bit of old
2x4 that's been soaked in some old oil to go between the pad and your
floor jack otherwise you'll probably run into the pad slipping off the
jack (ouch).  I'm planning on welding a couple of bumps onto the
bottom of my pads so they grip the wood block even better.  You could
also use the factory jack wound all the way down and stuck in the jack
port then put the floor jack under it.

Peter,

I had a similar series of experiances with my 944 about 2 years ago.
The car would run fine, but would suddenly stop dead with no warning
I was always able to restart the car, but sometimes it took about 
half an hour of waiting before it would start.  One time when it
stayed broken long enoug for me to trouble shoot the problem, I was
able to determine that the fuel pump was not running.  This eventually
led me to suspect the DME relay located in my fuse/relay box (I have
an '87 944).  

In short I eventually pulled the relay from its socket and then 
removed the plastic cover on the relay itself.  This revealed a small
printed circuit board with several solder connections on it.  On close 
(very close) examination I discoverd a failed solder joint on the 
largest solder pad on the PC board.  Apparently this solder joint
was making a good connection under certain circumstances (temperature 
etc.) but then opening for periods of time, thus shutting off the 
fuel pump and killing the engine.  

I took a soldering iron and re-soldered the joint (its best to 
remove the old solder first) put the cover back on the relay and 
stuck the relay back into the car and havent had a problem since.    

Good luck

Subject: Cruise Control Weirdness


I did not respond to this thread earlier because it seemed like a different
problem, but maybe not.

The cruise control in my '87 911 used to bleed off speed by about 0.5 mph/mile.
It seemed like a vacuum leak type of thing, but the CC is not a vacuum type of
system.  Unable to trace the problem to any obvious source, I eventually
replaced the CC brain.  Works great now.

I've heard about this same thing from a few other Carrera owners.  The CC
system may be the same in the 928.  In fact, the CC box has a 928.xxx. prefix
for the porsche part number stamped on it.

The CC brain is VDO manufactured electronics package.  A new one lists for
$600.  I called around bone yards and found a salvage from Parts Heaven for
$125.  I wanted to repair the one I have, (I suspect a bad transistor or
something) but I cannot get an electrical schematic.  I also cannot find
anyone who will repair VDO electronics.

If anyone knows how to debug these things, let me know.  As mentioned, I think
the problem is a simple failed transistor or thermister.  I've heard enough of
this same problem that if we can publish a "solder a replacement X-component
on the board" fix.  We may save a number of people lots of $$$.

I have seen something very similar to this behaviour in another car I owned

     Continuing the thread on welding... Usually when there is a desire to
     weld, there is also an accompanying desire to fabricate patch panels,
     brackets etc. for rust repair.  Welding takes you half the way there.
     There are two excellent books on metal fabrication called "Sheet Metal
     Fabricator's Handbook" and "Metal Fabricator's Handbook" by the same
     author.  There are other sources for this book but I know that it is
     sold by Eastwood through their catalog.  The sheet metal book is the
     one to get.  I have both and they are good reading for the apprentice
     welder.

I might have been more precise, Welding puts holes in your *person*.

I am intrigued by the gold deposited shield. I use a number 10 shield, and I
am going to a number 12.  I will try to find a gold deposited type an may
look to you for help in finding one, thank you for the offer. I readily admit
that it would be noce to see the work before striking the ark.

Put my floors in this weekend! I'm guessing about 360 spot (button hole)

What is the best way to raise the front end and then support?  Where is the

Next, how should the rear be raised?  And than supported with jack stands to
work on rear brakes?  I have one hydro floor jack, two jack stands and lots
of wood.
Mike Juzenas will probably be interested in this information as well.

More A/C condensor. It's part of the "get it right" package that Porsche
added to "fix" the A/C in '86 (one of the reasons it's my year of
choice for "best late 911"...)

Given that you have no airflow at idle, I think so. You get better
cool-down results driving at low speeds in *NON* stop-and-go traffic.

Subject: Oil leaks in 911

Hey P-filers,

This is hardly a new subject but my experience of the last few 
days might provide fodder for thought for someone in like
circumstances.

The initial oil leak problem was largely solved when I replaced
my '73 2.4L engine with an '83 3.0L 1 1/2 years ago. The past few 
months, however, have been somewhat frustrating due to a leak 
that I could not pinpoint. When I was at my local shop for clutch
clevis repair (nonscheduled <g>), the mechanic rounded up the usual 
suspects but all had ironclad alibis. Last week, having made some
free time, I finally tracked down the little drip. It was the oil
tank: specifically, the assembly that the oil filter screws in to.
The O-ring had shrunk and gotten brittle, and after only 22 years,
Sheesh. Well after receiving ribbing about being a space shuttle
commander, I replaced said part and the Challenger is flying again.
So, if you are looking for an oil leak, check everything, because
finding them is like an Easter egg hunt: you never know where
you're gonna find them. And that's all I have to say about that.

Regards,

Rob Yasek

Not without a HUGE amount of fabrication. It's a different length, has 
different mounting points, and uses a hydraulic clutch, for starters.
Fix your 915 instead.

It's not that hard, but you *MUST* have the special tools. All the
tools cost about as much as a rebuild, so you can either buy the tools and
have them for next time, or pay someone to do the work. YOu won't save

Subject: re: 944 sudden stall

here's another possible reason for a 944 to suddenly quit with
no warning, again involving the fuel pump.

there's a connector atop the transaxle through which power to
the fuel pump flows.  the one on mine decided to have an identity
crisis ("to connect, or not to connect...?") in, ahhh, rock springs,
wyoming, on easter sunday four years ago.

stopped cold with no warning, wouldn't start up unless it sat for
a few minutes, ran for a few miles, stopped again.  did this until
the duty cycle for "off" was such that 1 mile was a difficult
journey.  then towed to the nearest porsche dealer, in ... salt

Subject: 71 911T advice needed

Howdy,

There is a 71 911 T for sale, and I am thinking about buying it.
Before I go look at it, I would appreciate any advices from the gurus.
I have made the initial phone call and this is what he said:

He had it for 21 years, it has 130K miles, the car is daily driven, it
was a California car until 10 years ago, it currently lives in Chicago.
It has rust around headlights, the most severe part is at the right front
panel, I think it has holes. The floor board is solid, car has been repainted
once with a different color, it was original grey now midnight blue.
It has the Carrera-tensioner, Motor was rebuilt 60K miles ago by a 
professional. When I asked him about Divilar studs and pop-off valve, he
didn't know what I was talking about; I am not so sure myself either, please
enlight me. He also said that the synchro was worked on 8 years ago.

The car was also tuned 3 times since 21 years by professional (Perfect Power,
a reputable Porsche place). He claimed he had all records. Ths asking price is 
$4200. Reason for selling too small for family.

I am not looking to restoring it, I just want a daily reliable driver.

Many thanks in advance

Tom,

What kind of snow chains do you have? what type are the best, and what
sorts of experiences have you had using them.  Ive seen folks with
snow chains on just the drive wheels, but Ive always figured that a
set of four would give much better control than just two.

I dont need snow chains that often, because I live in Houston, in 
fact the chances of me needing them _here_ are about zero, but I do 
travel from time to time to various snowy locations, including ski 
resorts in the Rocky Mountains etc.  

Any information anyone has about snow chains in general would be 
appreciated.



Thanks!

Dan,
	I am not sure of the brand, but they come in a yellow and black box
and are the plastic teeth kind.  They will do the least amount of
damage if they let go.  One set fits my wife's Mitsu Galant (185SR15)
FWD, one set fits my Datsun pickup (they originally were for my 
'69 FBird, not even sure of the tire size) and I am not sure of the last
set and what car they used to go to.
	I like them, they are easy to put on and, best of all, they are light
weight.

Hello,
It is possible for water to get into the passenger side of a 944 if there 
is a hole underneath the battery. I have had this problem when I ran some 
wires from the battery to an amplifier in the back. Actually, it was my 
brother's idea (he is a grad student in physics). We drilled a hole in 
the battery compartment to run the wires down to somewhere behind the 
glovebox. We tried to patch around the wire and hole with a sealant but 
that didn't work. Water still got in and ran down the wire flooding the 
passenger side of the car. I would imagine that if there was any rust in 
the battery compartment or any kind of corrosion around the battery clamp 
studs, water will find a way to get inside the car. 

I tried to fix the problem applying bondo in the battery compartment and 
around the wire. It seems to have done the job, but once in a while during
a heavy rain storm, I see some water on the floor. It probably needs another 
coat. I hope this helps.

I agree with Stan.  I'd also say that the 915 is perfectly adequate for your 
car,
and you should not have reliability or longevity problems with it.

Bruce A. answers this question probably once a week, and I have long since
stopped reading his answers!  I think the jist of it, though, is that the 
conversion
is a boatload of work.  I think that Patrick offers a G50 conversion set-up, 
not
sure of its particulars but they advertise.

Nice things about the 915 are that different gearings are readily available, 
which
is not the case today for the G50's.  You will also find that Porsche 
mechanics
have rebuilt a lot of them, are familiar with the process, and have the 
spares
on hand.  All not true of the G50's, which are "too new," if that makes any
sense!

Here's a possibilty for these lights.

Some early 911's had round driving (fog?) lights that mounted to the small
grills to the left and right of the front hood edge.  So they were above 
the bumper and inbound the headlamps.  

"White" could refer to the lens, with "Yellow" being another choice.  

The unique grills may still be in place. 

IMHO, these lights looked "tacked on" and a previous owner may have
replaced them for aesthetic reasons.

I am the orginal owner of an 88 944S with 120k miles. Bodywork has been done 
in Mt Kisco at Simone Bros with excellent results. Formula Motorsports 
replaced the clutch a few years back but has never done any bodywork.  When 
I had work done at Formula, Mark only accepted cash for work and decided not 
to inform be of this until 3pm the day I was picking up the car. If you 
decide to use him, I'd check on his payment methods first.  Also, having the 
clutch replaced two other times (once before Formula and once after) I was 
not as pleased with Formulas work. I have heard other good things about 
Marks shop but unfortunately my experience wasn't.

Previous issues that arose on the list where a person commented on service 
casued a potential law suit so if you want to know more of my personal

I second the vote for Ivan.  When  at Foreign Service doing a routine oil
change he spotted a half-moon rip in the timing/balance shaft cover on my '87
924S. Broken Woodruff key at end of balance shaft and cog wheel(I previously
thought woodruff was something you added to white wine in May) was the cause
- --which he explained in detail. While taking everything apart for the fix he
found and replaced deteriorating right mount labor free since he was down there
at the time.
During a later fix of seals in the oil/water heat exchange, he spent some
amount of time making sure that the water reservoir was as clean as possible
without replacing. Nice attention to detail, I suppose because he was dealing
with the "Real(aerodynamically best of the bunch) Porsche" <g>.

At any rate, Ivan is also a roof mechanic--or is it RUF ?--Anyone know the
origin of the term?

Hi All,

        Seeing as how people are on the topic of 914 heater etc...

        With the onset of the rain and winter here, I have been noticing
the horible inefectiveness of my 914s' defroster/defoger. I have only
owned this car for a little over 7 months. But have already dropped the
engine a number of times to do extensive replacement of old/broken parts.
So my question is: Do the 914s simply have a really inefective system? Or
is there possibly something wrong? The heater by itself works great. But
the window keeps fogging up. It's really bad in the rain...

The lever has been checked and is operating  and the cabin temp sensor was
just replaced. The mixer flap has not been checked. If this is operating okay
would the heated air be cooler at a lower temp setting than say at a higher
temp setting. If so, maybe the mixer flap is not operating as the air is
always full hot. Do you know how I could check this out. Thanks,

Well I've never jacked up the car end-at-a-time, only side-at-a-time.  If
you use the jacking port the front wheel comes off the floor then, a 
short time later, the rear wheel.  I use jack stands on the rear with
a block of oiled wood in the triangular web under and slightly to the
read of where the torsion bar pokes out.  I've heard of putting the
stands on the bar itself but it isn't designed to bend that way and
I don't like it.  I've also used a block of wood under the rocker/jack
port (only on the left side, oil and a/c on the right) to jack the car.

as far as jack stands under the front of the car, I know I found a good
place on the suspension, but I can't visualize it right now.  When I've
wanted just one end up in the air my technique has been to jack up one
side with the jack at the jacking port and put a stand under the end
I want up.  Then I go to the other side and jack at the jacking port.
The weight transfer will settle the end you don't want up as the
second side comes off the ground.  then put a stand under this side too.
to get an end really high, like dropping an engine, you'll need to do
it in 2 or 3 stages.

What Mike has said is completely true.  Before upgrading the motor to a 3.2,
(and despite what has been said about the juvenile-ness of street racing).
 I on occasion would surprise some 5.0 Mustang drivers for a few stoplights.
 The 2.4E was a quick setup and I had no problem dusting the Mustangs.  At
the Pro Solos, you are hard pressed to find a harder launching car than the
911s.  With the 3.2 in the early 911 it's a Camero/Vette/GT3000 owner's
nightmare -- a 911 that can turn a sub-13 second quarter miles??]  Yow]

As far as maintenance and value considerations, Some of the 'philer's
experience is contrary to mine and my 5 previous 911s.  The most expensive
non-wear (brakes/tires/clutch, etc.) related maintenance item was a $300
alternator in our Carrera.  I've had no problems depending on them for
day-to-day use and have come out far better cost wise that ANY of the 20
someodd other vehicles I've owned....  Of course YMMV...

The actual cruise control actuator varies on each model.   944's are 
electric motors; others on pfiles report that 928's have vacuum servos. 
 Dunno about 911's.  In any event, a weak vacuum servo wouldn't matter 
much, because a cruise control is a closed-loop system, not just a 
throttle.  That is, as the car's load changes (hills, etc.) the speed 
should remain constant, because the cc logic monitors vehicle speed and 
actuates the servo accordingly.  So long as there was enough vacuum to 
operate the actuator to the level needed, you'd have a good cruise 
control system.

Defective electronics would cause nearly every symptom I've read about 
in this thread recently.

Electric systems (944's) are different than vacuum systems.  The 
electric actuating motor doesn't need vacuum, so it either does what 
it's told or it doesn't - no weak in-between states.  It can jam in a 
particular position or refuse to operate entirely, but it won't go part 
way and wimp out.

Both systems above actuate the throttle via direct mechanical linkage.  
Electronic throttle (so called "fly by wire") cars use an entirely 
different system with no external acutator.

If your car doesn't _hold_ speed or set speed almost perfectly, then 
the control electronics are likely the fault.  Complete failure, or 
erratic operation can be either the control or the actuator or related wiring.

The cruise control unit in my 951 is made by VDO.

Brake boost, HVAC flaps, emissions controls are primary uses.  There 
may be more.
Symptoms are variable depending on which subsystem is affected.  There 
might be no observable symptom, or the car could stall and refuse to restart.

Subject: 944 S2 Questions

Ok, I picked up my new (used) '90 944 S2 this weekend, and now am setting out to
prepare it for SCCA Solo competition.  I have several questions that only
brilliant people like the Porschephilers could know:  <G>
 
1.  The car is an M030, Sports Chassis.  I've been told this is extremely rare,
but I also have found a few more in the hands of my competitors.  How rare is an
M030 S2?  Is there any way to document how many were built with this package?

2.  Since it's the M030, it has 9" rears and 7.5" fronts.  Unfortunately, the
workshop manual doesn't list the 7.5" rim at all, and never says which cars came
with the 9" rims.  In SCCA people can and do get thrown out for not having a car
which matches the workshop manual or other factory documentation.  Where can I
get something more complete on the contents of the M030 package?  Does Porsche
offer any way to get component breakdowns of packages such as this? 

3.  Exhaust.  In SCCA Solo Stock we can remove and replace the exhaust from the
catalytic converter back.  I've done this on my turbo to help eliminate some
turbo lag and lose some weight (no muffler--just a 3" straight pipe), but on the
S2 I'm afraid it would be so loud as to be obnoxious to drive AND very likely
decrease available torque.  Since we are a low speed kind of event where torque
is everything, I doubt that I should consider an exhaust change.  However,
changing the air filter to a K&N should yield both hp & torque, so it's on the
list.  Opinions?

4.  Ride height.  As an M030, the front spring perches have about 1.5" of
lowering capability.  My first instinct is to use every bit of it and to lower
the rear to match.  It appears from the geometry that this will not effect front
caster and camber, but that the rear will get more negative camber.  Should I go
as low as it'll go in the front as I've planned?  Are there any performance
detriments to this (other than the difficulty in getting the car on and off the
trailer <g>)?  What kind of alignment should I aim for?  I'm assuming max front
caster and only around 1 degree negative camber all around.  The tires will be
(of course) BFG R1 230's, probably 245's all the way around, but I may
experiment with 225's in the front.

5.  What else would you put on your "to do" list?  Other than the cam belts are
there any major checks to make before I start pullin' some g's?

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

For what it's worth, my '81 also has this second A/C condensor.
Considering Stan's response, I have no idea if the one on my car
is original or was added after '86.  If it was added that would
explain why the steel bar surrounding it sticks out from underneath

Hi all,

I'd be careful about remarks on owning chains in the San Francisco area.

Why, just last week I saw a Mustang 5.0 with a bumper sticker that declared:
 "Sticks and Stones may break my bones, but whips and chains excite me!"
The fellow (I think it was a guy) had many earrings in BOTH ears, didn't 
look like a pirate and his leather was heavy with many studs. Shaved head 
too.

Seriously, if you have ANY Porsche with big meat rubber and wheels to match, 
buy a second set that allow for a normal size chain or legal traction 
device to fit under the fender WITHOUT contact at full suspension bottom.
This may mean 7" wheels and 215 tires on the back of a 944 to do this. My
914/6 would only take 5" x 15" wheels with 175/70 snow tires with chains.

When you use chains, make sure the damn things are TIGHT and SECURE. Observe
the 25 MPH speed limit when using them. When possible, borrow someone 
else's 4-wheel drive for these trips. Or rent one. Saves on the paint, also.

Our '84 had this and I'm pretty sure my '79 did too.  The earliest example
of this front condenser that I've personally seen is on Haas Fogel's '72
911E with "true" factory air (my '72 had the dealer installed unit that used
a cute little condenser/fan unit tucked in the lft. rear quarter.)

Yep.  I think some folks confuse this "standing idle" with the smart
practice that Turbo owners should use.  I have seen the temp in our 911 drop
at an idle, but it's only after successive back to back AX runs and the temp
was going from WAY TOO G__ DAMN HOT to just WAY TOO HOT...

The BFG R1 in the road race compound (230) is a great tire.  I am also
disappointed they chose to do away with the 226 (autocross only) compound,
but BOTH are faster than the Yoko RSII.  I've run all three, and IMHO the
average AX driver will consistently put in faster runs on the BFGs.  This, I
believe is because the BFG is a far more forgiving tire at the limit than
the RSII is -- you make a little mistake, you don't hose an otherwise good
run -- you have to drive a damn near perfect run to equal an average run on
the BFGs (just buy any of the Yoko sponsored national Solo II competitor a
beer sometime and ask 'em).  The hot rumor running around the BFG
competitors these days is a THIRD compound will be the eventual replacement
of both the 226 and the 230 BFG R1.  This compound will wear and handle heat
(read: high speeds) like the 230 does, but start working at a lower
temperature and be "close" to the cold performance of the (sob) now defunct
226.  As a final word: as a company BFG (Michelin) has impressed me far more
than Yokohama ever did (or tried to do) by having such an active group (Team
T/A) aimed at the grass roots competitors -- answering phone questions,
e-mail questions, attending events and providing deeper contingency $$s....

Same thing happened to me on my '87 944S. I took the easy way
out and replaced the relay @ $44.  You can check your fuel pump
by removing the relay and bridging terminals 30 and 87b with
a short piece of wire with male spade connectors on both ends.
This will make your fuel pump run as long as your battery is
connected. You should here fuel going through the fuel rail.

The best chains I've used (I've trashed many!) are made by Konig.  The offer 
low profile versions to help with the little clearance problem.

They aren't cheap, but they are very well designed, perform well, and last. 
 I'd order a second set of rubber tensioners (the ususal campbells won't cut 
it) at the same time and store them in a zip lock.

I still use Imron for things that I don't have powder-coated.  It's great 
for engine blocks, small pieces that I need done but don't have enough for 
the minimum charge at the powder-coater.  There's a flattening agent 
available that you can mix in so you can get the original semi-flat finish

Older 911's do not have cis injecion so won't have the pop off valve, 
also should be a 2.2 or 2.4 eng no need for the studs either.

What you will have is lots of rust everywhere. Be real careful with this 
car. 10 years in the rust belt is enough to do it in.

As with buying any Porsche ALWAYS HAVE IT CKED OUT BY AN INDEPENDENT 
PORSCHE MECHANIC. If you are not a member of PCA find someone who is as 
someone usually knows about most of the Porsches in a give area.

Try  to get the receipts for all the work he said has been done on the 
car. Also ck out the mechanic with the pca group.

Subject: 924 and 924S To buy or not buy?

Ok, I need some advice from the experts on this one.  I 've settled on
buying another Porsche 924.  I had a '79 924 but I had to move to Texas and
it had a problem overheating and no AC.  Now that I am in Dallas I've found
that you cant live in this city without a car.  I 'm on 
a low budget and the 924 seems like the logical choice.  I have found
two cars for sale and I need some advice on what to look for.

First Car:  87 924S with 94K, Car was orginaly a Champagne color
but it has now been repainted burgundy.  The interior is in descent shape and
the engine/drive train *look* alright but I am not sure what to check for.  I
tool it for a test drive and the handling was *very* responsive and quick (
Blew the hell out of my old 924).  However the tires had a tendency to break
loose on dry pavement easier than I expecte ( Eagle GT 205/65 ).  Also the
power steering pump had been disconnected and bungee corded to the side of
the engine compartment, there was power steering fluid residue all over the
right front suspension components and a couple of the bushings were
splitting.  From what I understand the 924 uses the 944 drivetrain and
 suspension with the old 924 shell.  Can anybody tell me more about the 924S
and what to look for in this model? ( Also had no sunroof which I 've never
seen before)

Second Car:  82 924 with 70K, I haven't actually seen this car yet but the
owner claims it is in perfect condition but I would like to know if there is
anything in particular that I should look for?

I want the 924S but would settle for the 924 as a decent daily driver while I
sweat for the pennies to get a newer 944S.

Last but not least, does anyone know a good Porsche shop in the Dallas area?

Thanks in advance

No. You can bead blast pistons, con rods, heads -- things that
don't have oil passages that can get plugged up and not cleaned
out. You gotta clean the case the hard way. I use about 4 hours of
hard scrubbing in new Varsol, follow with about a case of spray
carb cleaner with more scrubbing. Final rinse in carb cleaner, spray
dry with "dried" compressed air.

Then again, I'm *REAL* picky about this sort of thing.

> Also I would like to Replace the stock cam

> where I can get one?  

You need Duanne Spencer's book "The 356 Performance Handbook". There *ARE*
still performance cams being made (none up to the late lamented Stoddard
Performance Cab), and this book points out the makers and pros and cons
for most of them popular grinds. Some advise: don't go for too much more
lift, and stay under 280 degrees of duration for a street engine. A stock
912/SC cam is *VERY* good though and you'd need to spend some time convincing
me that you *REALLY* needed to replace it for performance reasons unless you
were building a vintage racer (then the rules might get you...)

> One more Question
> is ther anny difference between the aluminum

Yes. Different clearance, different thermal expansion and heat shedding
rates, and mainly different pistons. You *REALLY* want to either get a
set of the "real" 912/SC alloy piston/cylinders, or get your old jugs
rebored and just replace the pistons. ***BE VERY CAREFUL*** if you have
the cylinders rebored -- I've recently run into shops not putting the
cylinder under enough compression when boring, so that once you torque the
head down, well, Mr. Piston doesn't fit so well any more...

Subject: RE: Blaupunkt Security Code


Mike,

	I had a similar problem when I bought my 911. The first time that
the battery was disconnected (by the dealer who I bought the car from),
the radio wanted its code.

	The bad news is that, as far as I know, you have to get the correct
code (the dealer *eventually* got it for me from the previous owner) *or*
the radio has to go back to Blaupunkt. I have heard stories about putting
radios in freezers to make them lose their memories, but I have also heard
that it's not true (make sure you seal it watertight if you try this) ...
then again, seeing how easy it was for a service engineer to override the
password on my laptop makes me suspicious of any such scheme.

	One tip - if you put more than 16 (?) incorrect codes in, the radio
will lock up and will not accept any more attempts to enter it, and the
documentation says that it *has* to go back to Blaupunkt. My dealer told
me that if you leave it switched off but with power connected (i.e., with
ignition key in acc position) for 1 hour, it will accept another code
attempt.

	Hope this helps.

Subject: Performance cam for 356

For my 356 SC I selected Dema Elgin's Hot Street cam (I do not recall the
number, but I will find it for you if you wish) With big carbs, stock exhaust
and a lightened flywheel, it takes some revs to start up a moderately steep
hill, but the engine is a runner, with lots of torque from as low as
2500-3000 rpms. I am running 9.5:1 1750 big bores on pump gas without a hint
of problems. Dema recommends as high as 10:1 compression, but I did not have
the guts.

Before anyone flames me for for building a potential grenade, remember that a
cam with more overlap can allow "relief" at lower rpms, eliminating the
liklihood of pinging in the mid range where 356s are succeptable. (This
"relief" as I have named it is due to the fact that the piston has already
begun its travel up the cpmpression stroke when the intake valve closes, and
some gas apparently escapes during this phase, lowering the effective
compression ratio) As the rpms go up, the "relief" effect diminishes (due to
the increased inertia of the incoming gasses), but the greater velocity of
the fuel/air mix at the intake valve creates better mixing in the chamber,
better and more complete combustion, and perhaps other witchcraft which
prevents pinging. 

This kind of compression ratio could not be expected to last using a more
conservative cam.

Anyone tempted to extend this logic to a late 911 is discouraged from doing
so, in that the witchcraft performed on the intake headers may negate the
effect of relief. 911 SCs are more succeptable to pinging at high rpms when
the tuned headers are doing their thing.

I have never measured the performance of "scooter" (as we call the 356 SC),
but I know that he gives our gracefully aging (then) 911 SC a run for its
money up to 35 mph or so.

Bear in mind that a 912 is heavier, and this kind of engine might not work as
well for you. I have no knowledge of the gear ratios involved, but I would
look into it if I were you, in order to assure that I was creating a balanced
machine.

Disclaimer: If I have managed to sound like I know what I am talking about,
do not be fooled.

Good luck, and stand back when you first start it up,

Subject: '72 911 S questions

Eric Brown (ericb@microsoft.com) asked,

- -------------------------------------------
I was talking with a local Porsche mechanic, Squire Tomasie,  who is 
very highly
regarded. I told him that I was looking for an early 911 that would be a good
daily driver and autocrosser and I mentioned the '72 S. He brought up 
two points
that I was hoping you could comment on.

First, he said that the S had its power and torque come on very late, 
like above
5500 RPM, and that an E would make a better autocrosser because of a wider
torque curve.
- -------------------------------------------

This is not true of the "2.4" S. I have plotted out the torque curves of the
T, E, and S
and only the T has an advantage at lower RPMs, but at VERY low RPMs where you
should not be running anyway. The S has much better top end and a higher
redline,
so you can go faster in each gear, without losing time up and downshifting.
This 
should more than make up for a few foot pounds less of mid-range torque. 
The S is strong enough at 3500 RPM, with a kick at about 4500 rpm right to
the
redline of 7300. I have driven SCs that felt weaker in midrange power than my
S.

- -------------------------------------------
He also said that the oil tank in the '72 was a bit problem prone and 
that it was
difficult to plumb an external oil cooler. Have you had any problems with
your
oil system plumbing? Have you added an oil cooler? Would an oil cooler only
really be needed for extended high speed track driving?
- -------------------------------------------

The 2.4 S already has a front loop cooler. A non-stock cooler would be
illegal anyway,
and the biggest problem with my car is that it NEVER  warms up in cool
weather! 
The stock cooler is fine even for track use with a stock 2.4S engine.
If you are not interested in keeping stock, I have heard that the '72 S oil
console
is the best to use for external oil coolers, and has been used in some
non-'72
race cars. The '72 has a seperate filter assembly and oil tank. So I don't
know
where the mechanic got his info from.


- -------------------------------------------
BTW, I am going to be looking at a '74 S tomorrow. Any comments about that
car in general? I know that it has a larger engine (2.7) that is 
slightly de-tuned
compared to the '72 S, so its torque curve would probably be broader.
- -------------------------------------------

The '74 S is a real nice car. It has a much stronger torque curve than the
2.4 S. 
It even has as much torque as the 3.0 SC engine, but weighs less. It
is also quite light, barely more than a '73. But I would miss the top end
rush
of a "real" S engine. The '74 S can be easily converted to a '74 US carrera, a
nd that
would be a great car : 7 and 8 x 15 wheels would be perfect for the 225/50/15
tires.
Also you can use a bigger rear sway bar with the carrera in SCCA stock class.
Only rear flares, a duck tail (optional actually), rear sway bar, and front
spoiler 
would need to be added to make a Carrera, although you may need power windows
and a few other standard features to do it right (and legally).
Most '74S's did not come with the front loop cooler, although it could be
added. The '75 and up S is not nearly as good a performance car..

Subject: Re: 924/924S To buy or not buy?

JoshB999 asks about the merits of a 924S vs. a 924.

Keep in mind that I'm a devout autocrosser.  IMHO, if not for the
performance characteristics of Porsches, they'd really just be neat
looking but impractical cars.  Performance is what Porsche is all about. 
Such is my belief, and this weighs into my delicately worded opinion,
which follows:

ARE YOU NUTS?!  Oops, not as delicate as I had planned!  Sorry.  Start
over.

The 924S is a FABULOUS Porsche among the water pumpers.  It is, as you
say, a 944 in the lighter body of a 924.  IOW, it's typically quicker than
a 944, and since it's also a little narrower it's the C Stock weapon of
choice over the 944.  Best of all, many (I've heard "all" but I can't
confirm) of these cars came with the M030 suspension, which would account
for it's responsiveness.  First check to see if the car is an M030.  Pull
back the carpet from the rear over the spare tire and look at the build
plate.  It should list "030" somewhere on the list (my 944 S2 has it
first).  If it's there, it's still a good idea to make sure the special
spring perches are in place.  These cars came with an adjustable front
spring perch, which worked via a "screw" built into the bottom of the
factory Koni shocks.  Turn the front wheels to full lock and look from
the back up to the shock.  The lower section of the shock should be
threaded, allowing the perch itself to be raised or lowered.  If
everything is in order, and you can swing it, and especially if it's
priced about the same as the regular 924 you've looked at, it's a serious
candidate for purchase.  I've seen real nice 924S's in this area bringing
$7-$9K.  Regular 924's in the same shape, about half that.  Since the 924S
you looked at has some problems I certainly wouldn't want to pay too much,
but getting in now and correcting it's problems (that power steering could
be costly!) allows you to pay as you go, and when you're all done, you
have one of the best of the series.

Subject: 911's...Something ELSE to worry about?

In my search for a 911, I have read books, asked a lot of questions and 
talked to many people.  One of those people was a co-worker who owns an 
'82 Targa.  He advised that for some reason, the Porsche drivers seem to 
be "singled out" for abuse by other drivers.  Whether it's simply being 
"forced out" when trying to merge onto a highway, or having a pedestrian 
scratch the side with a key.  There seems to be a desire to retaliate 
against those who would own a Porsche.

Is it as bad as I've been led to believe?  Will I need to drive twice as 
defensively when I strap into the Porsche?  And will I need to worry 
every time I park, that my car is going to be molested?

If owning a Porsche requires this kind of paranoia, I'm not sure how 
much I'd enjoy owning one...

My experience has been that some people act like jerks and try to force you
out "just because you have a Porsche", and some people act more polite and 
let you in (maybe to get a look at the Porsche).

For me it is split pretty much 50/50.

If you are worried about owning a Porsche I would recommend getting some
other car.  If every time you park, you start to worry.  You are not going 
to enjoy owning the car.  For myself, I will not be pleased if my car gets
keyed or stolen.  However, this is what I have insurance for and part of
my buying decision was: if I have to worry too much about the car because
it is so expensive then I probably shouldn't buy the car.

I really hate seeing people park across two spaces etc... trying to keep their
car from harm.  If they are that paranoid I don't think they should buy the car.
Although, having said that I do always try to park at the end of rows and avoid
parking under trees (which drop sap).  

I know people who own expensive cars and who never worry.  Often their car
is worht more than mine, but they say "don't you worry".  The answer is
"no".  If they aren't going to worry about their $25,000 Nissan why should
I worry about my $25,000 Porsche.

        I believe that it's a 17mm.  The same as a VW transmission.
You can go to just about any auto parts store and ask for a "VW

Subject: Bead blasting

 
Wolfgang Attwenger asks about bead blasing the engine case and "cover"? of
his 912.
 
Don't do it. Damn beads get in everything, they're very difficult to get
out, and if any of them stay in there and get into the oil stream your shiny
new engine will be "Edelschrott" in a very short time. Makes a dandy coffee
table though.
 
"Cover"? You mean the third piece of the case, or the engine sheet metal?
It's OK to bead blast the sheet metal once it's been far removed from the
engine.
 
I know that people who sand blast car bodywork tell you to take the engine
and transmission out or you will have problems. Sand gets in through
transmission breather, various air and oil holes for engine. I'm told that
walnut beads do not have a problem, they are softer than glass or sand so
that if they do get into the engine they don't cause as much damage, but I
would still not risk it.
 
You are going to have to clean your engine the hard way -- by hand. If it is
out of the car, you can get a big start on it by spraying engine degreaser
on it, letting it sit for a few minutes, then using the high pressure
spray at a local coin-operated self-serve car wash to get the big black
pieces off. Do the rest by hand/fingers with solvent.
 
Cams -- where are you located? I know somebody in the San Francisco area who
does excellent work, but if you put in a cam you may also need springs
etc. And besides to get the most from a hotter cam, you also need to
address the rest of the intake system, pistons, compression ratio, also
change carburetor jets.
 
Pistons and cylinders -- I'm very happy with the forged aluminum pistons in
bored-out iron barrels. Shasta Design and other people make them using TRW
forged blanks. I have 60,000 miles on mine with no problems, despite
"experts" who tell you that this will only work for about 15,000 miles
or whatever before destroying an engine. The Japanese NPR pistons and
cylinders are cheap, and were a cheap solution for people who
wanted to keep their old, nearly worthless Porsches running. Now all of
these once nearly worthless cars are worth more (356s, etc) and it's again
sensible to put $600 or $1000 worth of pistons in a car worth $5000 and
up (356 again; good 912 close behind). Although NPRs are no longer being made,
they are relatively easy to find, but the people who have them for sale seem to
think that because they are no longer made they are worth lots more. For not
too much more money you can get the forged aluminum pistons and you'll be
much happier.

Well, someone keyed me this weekend.  Don't know why, either.  
As far as I can tell, I didn't cut anyone off, or anything like that.
It was in a parking garage, and someone must have done it on
"general princples".   Did a thorough job, too.   Right door,
right rear above the wheel, and left front behind the wheel.  

I'm fairly philosophical about these problems.  If someone assumes I'm
a jerk because I drive a certain sort of car, they most likely have
other reasons to assume I'm a jerk in addition to the car, so I might
as well just drive what I like.  In other words, fuck 'em.  But the
risk of vandalism remains, and you may have to expect such treatment,
particularly if you live out in the real world (and, believe me, it 
doesn't get much realer than Baltimore).

Btw, if anyone has repaired such damage to their paint, i'd appreciate
any tips you have.

Pfellow Philers:

	My '84 Carerra has been steadily losing its engine
tune.  There is an intermittent miss that comes and goes
depending on throttle position and what appears to be
the phase of the moon; the famous motronic "bucking";
rough idle; lousy gas mileage, etc.

	I've read Jim Pasha's excellent article in the latest?
_Excellence_ (thanks, Jim!).  There are some differences
between the motronic sensor implementation between the air-
and water-pumpers, which may be part of my confusion.

	I would have suspected the oxygen sensor, but Jim's
article states that it is turned off by the DME when the
engine is cold; my problems are not temperature dependent.

	I plan to go through the electrical connections for 
all the sensors and to clean and "seal" them with 
electronic grease.

	Does anyone have a troubleshooting matrix for motronic
related ills they could post?  I realize it may not necessarily
be motronic-related, but it seems to me that's the obvious
place to start.

Subject: 951 cutting out at 1700 rpm

Dear p-net gurus,

All of a sudden my 951 has developed problems revving above about 1700
rpms.  It idles fine, but as soon as I bring the engine speed up it
acts like I hit the rev limiter, i.e., the engine seems to cut out
momentarily until its speed drops back down.  By blipping the throttle
repeatedly, I can occasionally break through this 1700 barrier.  Once
I get the rpms up in this way, I can hold the engine at any speed
above 1700 as normal.  Since I knew that my spark plug wires were
marginal, I went ahead and replaced them, as well as wiggling FI
connectors, reseating DME and ignition relays, etc., all to no avail.
Any thoughts?

Subject: re testing 914 starter


Dear Michael,

What most overlook when testing the 914 starter circuit is the rear
transmission ground strap. It is critical in grounding the starter. If it is
worn, dirty, corroded or misconnected, the starter will turn over slowly and
in an extreme case where the battery is fresh, seek the accelerator cable as
a ground and melt it in the tube! Always check this ground lead first when
diagnosing starter problems. It is connected between the 10 o'clock position
on the rear transmission cover (under a nut) and the right rear trunk floor
stud.

Alternator belt adjustment is easy:  simply remove the two left front engine
cylinder cover oval access plugs, loosen the allen bolt under the front plug
and tension the altenator from under the side plug. Tighten the allen bolt
and reinstall the plugs and you are done!

Subject: re rust, chassis stiffening, POR1


Dear Al,

Before installing the chassis kit, we always coat both sides of the metal
with Metal Ready Primer (aids in welding) and then POR-15. When we install
the kit, we always make sure we have a solid bead of weld completely around
the perimeter to seal the two metal plates (as well as filling all of the
spot weld holes). We then add more POR-15 after wire brushing, then seam
sealer, chip guard and polyurethene paint. If you look at a 914 body closely,
the factory has sandwiched many of the sheetmetal parts together and they
have not necessarily rusted to any greater extent.

We always try whenever possible to spray rust paint into the inner box
section (longitudinal/inner rocker area). This gives us one upsmanship on
factory rust protection as today's rust prevention products are far superior
to what was available then.

For heat in racing cars with headers, we use the aftermarket VW bug electric
heaters. These stow nicely behind the speaker grilles and into the
paper/aluminum heater tubes, directly connect to the battery and mount an
on/off switch in the dash where the defroster switch would be. These heaters
allow the ventilation system to work normally while providing the
hottest/cleanest heat.

        Yes, they're still used up in Portland.  And no, they weren't out-
lawed by tire or salt lobbies, they were outlawed because they tore up the
roads.  I don't think it's going to be fun driving the 914 around up there
come Parade-time...  (If I get to go...)
        The studs make an interesting, if slightly disconcerting, sound
when you're driving next to them.  A bit like driving on a gravel road,
but more mettalic.

Actually, studded snow tires are commonly used in snowy parts of the
US.  When I was in upstate NY, they were legal from October through
April, or so.  They worked *really* well on icy roads.  They are a
good compromise (of safety vs. road wear) for areas that are icy more
often than not in the witer months; where the road surface is hard
packed snow rather than asphalt.

California drivers are scary in the snow!  Where I grew up, nobody
needed or used chains except for the snow plows and fire engines...

On another weather note, I have noticed this week that my 931, with
its 3-4 inches of road clearance, is not the best amphibious vehicle
for fording flooded streets!  I really should fix my truck.

You think that's bad, b-b-b-baby you ain't seen nothing yet!

In SCCA Solo-II we cannot even run the Carrera hydraulic cam chain
tensioners! They are illegal even in street prepared unless the engine
had them standard, i.e. 3.2. I have written to the SCCA Solo Events Board
since the mid-80's trying to get these legalized. I told them that any
Porsche dealer will install them on a customers engine that has old,
worn tensioners. I even sent a copy of the factory technical bulletin
kindly provided to me by Bruce Anderson. But they said it is not a
recall or factory directive, and the original parts are still available,
so we can not use them.

The SCCA rules are super strict, and nothing can be legally changed from
stock unless the rule book specifically says so. This keeps most older
911s out of the stock classes : who wants to take chances of destroying
a $7,000 engine? (I guess I'm about the only one dumb enough...).

If you don't like the rules (does anyone like them?) then you should
write the SCCA. I will give you a copy of the factory bulletin if you
want to show it to them again. I think the currect SEB is trying to
be friendlier than the old "Lotus lovers, Porsche haters" group.
At least the SCCA has a rules committee that takes member input
seriously and has a process of getting clarifications and changes.
I called the PCA rules guy and got no help at all.

The best way to change this rule is to allow any modification which helps
protect the engine but provides no performance advantage (tensioners,
oil baffles, etc). But I don't think they would ever allow non-stock
coolers of any kind, since they could be argued as a performance
enhancement.

No, not me . . .

This evening I spoke with George Murphy, a contributor to The Star magazine 
(MBCA) who has a sideline remanufacturing a variety of VDO products, and he 
*believes* that the cruise control amplifiers used by M-B, Porsche, BMW and 
a number of other auto manufacturers are the same.  You will want to talk to 
him -- preferably with the VDO part number off of your unit in hand -- 
before sending it in.  His address(es) and phone number are:

     e-mail:  murphyga@ornl.gov

He has been warned of the potential influx of questions/requests.

On the phone he said that a system that will accellerate but not hold 
definitely has a failed amplifier.  His prices for remanufactured units vary 
by type but are probably between $99 and $150 with core.

I have done business with Mr. Murphy in the past and have found him to be 
friendly, knowledgeable and reasonable when it comes to price.

  Up here in Portland, tire studs are still legal and really do chew up the
  roads.  It's great to drive down the highway in those three inch deep
  tire ruts - you don't have to steer :-).  It takes a massive effort just
  to get your car out of the ruts to change lanes!    When the rain we get
  turns to ice (aka black-ice) in the mornings and evenings, the studs make
  a big difference.  Almost everyone in my sales office has them on the
  cars.  Salt is strictly banned, and the rock pebbles they throw down do
  little in our icy environment.

Don't take out the axles unless you have "stub" axles to put in the 
hubs. The axles hold the bearings together. You can take the CV apart 
from the stub axles and use your own or find a couple at swap meet or 
wrecking yard.

Do you have a tow insurance at least they will pay one  way.

Yes, the crux at the heart of being a Porsche fan. I sold my '87 Carrera
Cabrio three years after I had bought it new after enduring thrown rocks,
numerous "fingers", being cut off in traffic, slashed tires...and I ordered
diamond blue to be low key!
Perhaps now that the car has a few years on it, it wouldn't cause such a
stir.  I always felt very uncomfortable in that car, especially contrasted
with the '77 S coupe that I had before it.  Porsches attract attention,
newer ones can make some green with envy.  It's one of those things that
you have to weigh. As great a machine that that 911 was, I couldn't live
with the image and all that it carried with it.  And it being so new (read
$$$$$$$) made me treat it, at first, like jewelry, rather than a  car to
use.  It felt like it was owning me, rather than the other way around.

After suffering acute Zuffenhausen withdrawl, I bought a lovely '64 356SC
coupe that generates lots of nice comments and appreciating glances.  The
antithisis of my Cab experience.  And a fine car in its own right.

Porsches are one of lifes great rewards...enjoy!

Hi John,

The driving lights (maybe "rally" lights) were round and above the bumper

Yes, the crux at the heart of being a Porsche fan. I sold my '87 Carrera
Cabrio three years after I had bought it new after enduring thrown rocks,
numerous "fingers", being cut off in traffic, slashed tires...and I ordered
diamond blue to be low key!
Perhaps now that the car has a few years on it, it wouldn't cause such a
stir.  I always felt very uncomfortable in that car, especially contrasted
with the '77 S coupe that I had before it.  Porsches attract attention,
newer ones can make some green with envy.  It's one of those things that
you have to weigh. As great a machine that that 911 was, I couldn't live
with the image and all that it carried with it.  And it being so new (read
$$$$$$$) made me treat it, at first, like jewelry, rather than a  car to
use.  It felt like it was owning me, rather than the other way around.

After suffering acute Zuffenhausen withdrawl, I bought a lovely '64 356SC
coupe that generates lots of nice comments and appreciating glances.  The
antithisis of my Cab experience.  And a fine car in its own right.

Porsches are one of lifes great rewards...enjoy!

The cyanide compounds are specifically isocyanates. Here, one form of

Peter,
	When my US spec 993 was sitting next to my German friend's 993,

Subject: Race force transmission

Let's see if I can make this coherent.  There are three independent
mechanical linkages.  The INPUT .. engine to clutch .. is controlled
by the engine speed.  The OUTPUT .. wheels back to output gears is
controlled by the wheel speed.  The IN BETWEEN .. the transmission
input can be locked to the INPUT (clutch out) or the OUTPUT (in gear)
or both (running down the road).

The role of synchronizers is to make the IN BETWEEN match the OUTPUT
when the clutch is IN.  The synchronizers are funny clutches that will
run in gearbox lubricant and match the speed of the IN BETWEEN and
the OUTPUT.  This has to have rather funny behavior.  It's role is
to match the speeds as you slide into gear .. and then get out of
the way since the acutual engagement is via a 'gear-within-a-gear'
(which some of us call dogs).  This mechanism wants to get into
place firmly before the power is applied strongly.

In road usage, the synchronizers first delay the shift .. back
pressure on the gear lever) until the speeds of the IN BETWEEN
and the OUTPUT are close.  Then they release and let you slide into
gear with little speed mismatch.  This give smooth shifts and is
eased by pause in up-shift and double-clutch on the way down.

If you race, you are more impatient.  You want to get into gear and
get accelerating (or decelerating) withoug waiting for the synch
to take place.  This severely wears the synchronizers and puts
more stress on the 'dogs'.  Still, if you are willing to put up
with wear, it is faster.

Some transmissions have no synchronizers at all.  They want to
be put FIRMLY into gear to get the maximum engagement.  They will
only grind if you are a wimp at shifting.  Most cycle transmissions
are like this as are some racing transmissions.

Subject: Upgrading to M030 suspension

Hello p-filers,

I'm looking into upgrading my '87 944 Turbo to the M030 suspension offered
as part of the Turbo S.  Anyone ever done this?  Can I do this without also
upgrading to the Turbo S spindles and 928S4 brakes, or will the adjustable
Konis and springs just bolt on to my existing setup?

What's the effect of NOT upgrading the torsion bars to 25.5mm (mine are
23.5mm), but adding the rest of the options?

If the car is being used at track, autoX and on the street a few days a
week, is it worth it to upgrade beyond the swaybar options from the M030
(27mm fromt, 18mm back) and go to, say 30mm front and 20mm in the back? 
This has been suggested by a few folks I've talked to, but I don't know what
to believe. Thanks.

The asking price of $12,500.

What is a fair price?

Thanks, Kevin.  I am now about 95% sure that the problem is the
throttle switch (i.e., confident enough to go out and buy a new switch
tomorrow and achieve complete certainty).  Terminals 4 and 6 show
about .5 ohm throughout the full travel of the throttle (i.e., the
switch isn't opening those terminals in-between idle and full throttle
like it is supposed to).  I was led to checking this after I stumbled
upon the test procedure for checking "throttle valve cut-off" in the
factory manual (turbo supplement).  It says: "Pull off plug on
throttle switch and bridge terminals 4 and 6 with auxillary wire.
Start engine and increase speed to approx. 1600 rpm.  The motor should
begin to surge."  My switch is evidently keeping these terminals
bridged all of the time, and the motor does indeed surge when I hold
the throttle open at least far enough to hit 1600-1700.

P.S.: Even though the plug wires weren't the problem, the new
ones have ended the fireworks display under my hood! :-)

It's real simple: the "real" carbs are still readily available. Parts are
readily available. There is no compelling reason to allow substitute carbs,
and no one has bothered to get an exemption. 

The Weber exemption for 911s with Solex and Zenith and MFI has largely
to do with lack of availability of new whole replacement units. Since
the Weber is a suspercession item *PER PORSCHE*, it's legal. If you could
still buy Zeniths, there would be a lot of unhappy early 911 owners...

> It is a less expensive way to cure the worn Solex syndrome.

I'll take exception to this. A *GREAT* rebuild is about $250 per carb, and
gives you perfect restoration of all functions. The best price I've seen 
on a conversion is direct from PMO, and is about $460. So the delta is 
in the noise particularly when you consider that a properly set up Solex 
PII-40 gives a lot more top-end power than a Weber, but the smaller
main bore on the Weber makes more torque in the midrange, which "feels"
faster/better/etc than the Solex. Once you crest 4500 RPM, though, it's
a different story...

Use a 2x6 cross wise in front of the gas tank for the jack..Put the

You can jack the rear with about a 18" section of 2x4 or 2x6 under the motor
running front to back. I have a batch of historic 911s from R to ST to RSR
and SCRS with cases I don't want to damage and it has always worked well.
Obviously rear jackstands go on the ends of the torsion bar tubes in the rear

17mm. I think this is the case on all SCs -  it was on my 79 SC.

I checked that I could first open the filler plug - no point in removing all
the oil just to find that you can't fill it! 
I also had to unclip the throttle cable hinge thing which got in the way of
the filler plug. Took just under 3 Liters.

You recall from the threads that I have been having a cut out frob on my 
85/944, further examination has convinced me that it is the throttle 
position detector.
The position sensor is bolted on to the underside of the throttle 
butterfly mechanism.

The detector is, I beleive a simple linear potentiometer, they obviously 
tend to wear at something like the normal throttle position, last night 
when mine started playing up, I found that with the car stationary, mine cut 
out at 1900 revs whenever i brought the revs back down thru the range.

A few years ago I had a ford with bosch efi and I had a similar problem, 
once diagnosed, and it took a while, the mechanic simply disconnected the 
sensor ( by unplugging the cable ) and the engine ran fine.

I haven't tried that this time on my car because the problem is too 
intermittent - this morning I did 90 miles with no problem, I suspect 
that my sensor is failing in a slightly more progressive manner than 
yours, but eventually it will be cutting regularly.

You should be able to prove out the sensor in position, with the engine
switched off, by getting an ohm meter and connecting it between two of the
3 contacts on the sensor and then slowly turning the throttle pulley, I 
cannot tell you which of the three contacts to connect the meter to.

All my engineering experience make me think that this is a more likely 
explanation than a DME failure, things that happen at mid range in 
electronic controlled systems are usually external events, electronic 
systems tend to fail at one or other end of the operating range, for 
example either in start up or rev limit mode. Of course Sods Law may apply...

This is 1995. Car and investment constitute an oxymoron. If you think
buying an 18 year old production car with over 100,000 miles is an
investment, do more research. If you want a good car to enjoy, spend
time and money while you own it, and MAYBE not take a bath when you 
sell it, find a good 911. If you are really looking for an investment,
consider buying an undervalued stock or get involved in futures.

The is the apocraphal story about the UK police on the M$ motorway 
playing snooker -

Snooker is a game like pool played with 15 red balls and 6 coloured 
balls, the object is to pot a red, then a coloured ball, replace the 
coloured ball and repeat until all the reds have been potted - each of 
the coloured ball carries different point values

The police patrol crews were playing the game of having to nick a red car 
followed by the highest values colour etc etc

In this game yellow vettes would have been virtually imune from tickets, 
there only being 1 yellow ball, and it only scored 2 points - better 
still if you drove an orange car you would never get booked...

Subject: Maryland Motorsports Park

I went to the fourth and final meeting of the Maryland Motorsports Park
organization.  The group of developers is attempting to gain approval
fromthe Hartford County COuncil to get the proposal approved.

The park will feature a 1.5 mile IMSA style course + 1 1.05 mile
SCCA/Club course which can be combined to a 2.55 mile F1 course.

The poromoters ar emphasising "Not Just Racing" events, such as
concour, dog shows, a bandstand (for concerts) and bicycle racing.

They are interested in club support (hence my attendance as PCA
Delaware President) and they realize track events/drivers ed will be a
prime supported of their facility.


The plan for the facility is in Havre De Grace, a town just south of
the susquehanna river, just off I-95, 20 miles north of baltimore.  The
track directly adjoins US 40, so there is no need for transporters to
negotiate curvy backroads.

It's about 20 minutes from Baltimore, 80 minutes from DC, and 80
minutes from Philadelphia.

They are trying to garner support in the form of petitions and letters.

Spotted in a local paper;

1975 914 rebuilt motor, new brakes, no rot, int like new, needs some
work $1200

Being the curious sort I called,  the extent of the details I was able
to get were, It belonged to this guys father who purchased it in 89  The
Father passed away (sounded like seversl years ago) and the car has just
been sitting.  He is handeling the sale for his mom who technically owns
the car now.  They are just interested in getting rid of it and stated
the price was flexible.  Technical details supposedly had a new 1.8
engine installed (don't know who did the rebuild or exactly when).  He
had no idea what it mght need, it has no battery (or a dead battery) and
sounds like the tires are deflated.  Thats the extent of the details I
got.

Anyway I plan on taking a look this weekend.  I'm looking for helpful
hints on what to look for, and impresions on price.

Subject: testing 914 starter

Thanks George for the advice. What I did:
 -check ground strap by jumpering between negative battery cable and engine
block - still cranked weakly.
 -check for hydro (gasoline) lock by removing spark plugs. There was quite a
bit of gasoline on the plugs, but even without them, engine cranked weakly.
 -check for bad battery by substituting good battery from my wife's car -
still cranked weakly.
 -measure starter motor resistance (too high, some Porschephiles think) and
voltage during cranking (too low), which suggested shorted winding.
 -ordered a rebuilt starter from you.

Yes, the struts are interchangeable, though not cheap.
I did the full conversion -w- 26MM torsion bars in back.  It worked pretty well.  I had the 26.8mm front swaybar (since then a 30MM ghas become available) and had a weltmeiseter 22mm rear bar, whcih was overkill, even in the full loose position.

The same as if you just put stiff springs in the front.  The struts are
not particularly exciting, except that they are ride height
adjustable.

The biggest benefit of the packaqge is the front brakes.  Beyond that
it just abounts to stiffer bushings.  Don't forget theat the control
arms are actuially different, since both bushings (rear saddle and
front to engine X-member) are stiffer.

If you REALLY do the full conversion you have to change out the reqar
trailing arms, since their moulded in bushings are also stiffer.

If you're not doing the brakes, you can do just as well  by buying some short springs, the 30MM anti-sway, an adjustable rear bar, and 26 or 27mm torsion bars, as well as Koni struts.  The adjustable spring perches are nice, but not realy necessary.

Don't forget to account for new wheels (8+9x16 is the hot setup)

    I couldn't agree more ! One of the top reasons people buy Ferrari is also
 one of the top reasons they sell it--the attention, and it flips both ways;
 most people are friendly, and someone at every gas station will just want to
 know how much (80 thousand dollars) and how fast (a hundred ninety three... 
 these aren't close to truth but if you say $22k/135mph they're terribly 
 disappointed). But a lot of people look at you as if YOU were the lawyer who 
 foreclosed on their house....or want to size you up as if, gee, YOU don't
 LOOK rich...or feel they have to race you...or go way out of their way to 
 ignore you-- The last class are usually men in their 40s who damn well  
 thought -they- had the glamour car of the neighborhood.  Really gets 'em.

    My other car is a '70 Mustang convertible, bright yellow. Gets all the
 attention but never a discouraging word, only complete enthusiasm. Cops ??
 I drove everyday for 8 months just down the street from a cop station without
 any cop noticing I didn't have registration or inspection sticker---they were
 too busy looking over the car !
    I don't drive cars for the attention--I'm proudest of my 4RE when I get
 out of it in front of the corner auto parts store, me covered in grease head
 to toe working on some other car. Really makes 'em wonder.

     Anybody who drives an exotic for the glamour usually ends up terribly
  disappointed and fearing every bump in the road.  Anybody who drives a car
  for the thrill of the car--and for Ferrari, its good handling and a 
  phenomenal sound at the expense of a very crude Italian car--always wears a
  smile.

Tom,
I have a rack from Rhode Gear I use with my cabriolet, and with my 300 zx.
They have some good stuff, and a reputable dealer/sporting store/bike shop
should let you try it on the car in the lot before you decide which one.  At
least here in Houston, that's the way I found one that would work.

Skis are a different matter though.  I tend to cab to the airport with them

Hello Porschephiliacs,
	I was sifting through the records on my '77 924 recently and 
discovered the manual trans oil hasn't been changed since 1986! My owners 
manual says to use 30 weight hypoid oil. Is there any particular brand or 
type of lubricant that is better?  I hate to try anything too radical, 
the trans shifts fine except for a slightly weak syncro in 3rd (no 
grinding or anything).  I've heard you shouldn't use synthetics like 
Redline on a really dirty trans (like mine probably is by now) because it 
will loosen sludge and churn it through your gears.  So should I go with 
Redline or use regular old lubricant? Any recommendations would be 
appreciated!
THANX!

Well, maybe David meant investment in his own happiness, in
which case an SC is a terrific choice.  With respect to the colour, this
is just my opinion:  it matters less that it is not an original colour
for that year than that it is consistent with the colours Porsche used
for that model and surrounding years.  A metallic nile green would
look really out of place, for example.  Unless you want to concours
the car (heaven help you and yours), who the hell know all the colours
Porsche used at any given time?  (OK, Brett Johnson and John
Patarek, wise guys.)

The price depends a lot on the condition of the car's mechanicals,
assuming you've OK'd the coachwork.  100K is well into the mileage
at which you *might* need major work, depending on all sorts of
things.  Then again, maybe not.

Depending, depending, depending, $12.5 is toward the high side of
the car's worth.  If the mechanicals are good to go for, say, another 40K
miles, probably a fair price.

I had a look at a book similar to the "yellow" book used car price
list which is for "collectible" cars (whatever that means !).  It listed
WHOLESALE prices of 1982 911 SC Targa at low 12,000 and high 18,000.
This was a little out of date - last july I think.  It's a 1/4ly
publication.  Now I realize that the $18,000 is a 98 pts concours car,
but I wouldn't say that 12.5 was towards the high side of the range though
paerhaps for this particular model given body work, high miles etc.

Peter,

Thanks for the reply.  I had vaguely remembered a thread on this, but
had not yet gotten desperate enough to go back through the archives to
remind myself where I had seen it (my memory ain't what it used to
be!).  Instead I did a little more poking around last night, and I am
now fairly certain that the throttle switch is indeed the culprit (see
my response to Kevin Gross, who also rang in with a number of
suggestions, the throttle switch included).

I'm not certain how things are on your car, but on mine the throttle
switch detects two things: (1) the angle of the throttle butterfly
(using a potentiometer) and (2) whether the car is at idle, full
throttle, or in-between (using a pair of switches that close at the
endpoints of the throttle travel).  The angle pot in my switch tests
OK, it is the other switch that appears to now be permanently closed
regardless of throttle position.  It sounds like it might be the
reverse for you.  Even though my car has been grounded for a day or
two, I am glad that the failure was hard (the bug stayed put until I
could find it), not intermittant like yours.  Another piece of luck is
that on the 951, they put the switch on the side of the throttle body,
rather than underneath, so I am hoping the replacement will be more
straightforward.

This anti-911 attitude is not unique to the U.S. I remember when I bought my

never talked to me before, came to my desk and asked if I owned a Porsche.
"No." But I could have sworn I saw you driving a red 911 with oval export
plates this weekend. "Wasn't me. I have a red Golf with Ludwigsburg plates."
It sure looked like you, aviator sunglasses and all...  He walked away,

Body:  both front fenders replaced.  (No bondo.)
Paint: new paint.  (Used 1992 Emerald Green).

New tires.

Question I have is, given the fact that there has been body work done, and
that the paint is not original _and_ not a true 1978 color, would I be
making a poor investment?

The asking price of $12,500.

This is now a big discussion topic, why is it called "street Prepared"
when the cars won't pass emmisions (no catalytic converter, etc)
or other road laws. Most people think the class is OK as is, maybe
the name just needs to be changed.

I think the SCCA solo board would be happy to listen to you : they
should hear from people who don't want to join due to idiotic rules.
Actually, you should write to the SCCA president or Board of
directors! They want people to join, and should be told of these
problems and why you are not joining.

I will be glad to provide addresses and fax numbers to anyone
who is kind enough to write to the SCCA to improve the rules.

The ride height modification rule HAS BEEN DROPPED! So any
car with STOCK height adjustable suspension may now lower to
their hearts content.

As for classes, the 914 2.0 stays in CS, but the 1.7 and 1.8 move
from DS into CS with their bigger engined brother. The 944T S
and 968 move from BS to AS. These are the only Porsche class
changes this year. In a nutshell, SS is 930 and 928, AS is all 911s
 and 914/6, BS is 944S, S2, 944 T (non-S), CS is 944, 924S, and 914-4.
SCCA does not have 20 stock classes like PCA, so a '65 911
runs against a 993!

- -------------------------
Ted/David,

I was pretty disappointed in the work Mike (of Los Gatos Upholstery) did on
my
88 targa top.  He came well recommended so I hoped he could fix the hack job
on the repair arranged by the former owner (the top had been knifed).

The materials were very good and the top had no twists or loose fitting.  Off
the car it looked great!  But when installed it did not fit properly, leaving
a
large, uneven gap at the trailing edge (it didn't fit snugly with the targa
bar)
and the leading edge was too high, creating a lot of drag and wind noise. 
(This
car had never had been in any collision; the top from another 88 targa fit
fine.)
Furthermore, the driver's window wouldn't fit neatly into the rubber slot in
the
top if it was raised before the door was closed.

The car was left with him for the work.  This wasn't a mail order job.  And
when I complained he kept it for another day and, as far as I could tell, he
corrected nothing in that time.  After my second complaint he said that was
the best he could do.  I paid $275 for the job, plus another $240 for the
targa
bar seal (yikes...$200 for the part alone!).  Syd's Upholstery (Middlefield
Rd in
Mtn View, another highly recommended shop) promised they could fix it right,
for another $200.  I lived with it until it was sold.  I will never go back
to
Los Gatos Upholstery.

Dear Bob & fellow Porsche fans:

	As a Porsche 356 owner and BMW motorcycle rider, I too was fascinated  by
the rumor of a Porsche motorcyle, though I expressed my doubts to you from the
first. Given the soft motorcycle market and Porsche's present financial
constraints, it simply seemed unlikely.
 	
	The sole detail that prompted further inquiry was the inclusion of the
name of Porsche board member Hans Riedel in some versions of the tale; for I
knew Herr Riedel well from his days at BMW Motorrad, and I knew of his
continuing affection for two-wheeled German iron.
	
	Still, it was with a sceptical predisposition that I approached Hans
Sautter, a close mutual friend of Mr. Riedel and of mine, who also happens to
be
top press man for BMW motorcycle world wide. Mr. Sautter not only assured me
that the Porsche motorcycle rumor was false, but pinpointed its origin in the
German motorcycle magazine Motorrad Reisen und Sport.

	Thus, regrettably perhaps, there is no truth whatever to the Porsche bike
story.

Now that I've overhauled my 914 I have these items for sale:

914-4 rear brake calipers.  These were in good working order when they came
off my car last summer. Complete, nothing frozen, with pads. Passenger-side
unit's rigid brake line is still attached 'cause someone rounded off the
nut's edges and I didn't want to deal with it. $100 ea., $175 the pair.

914-4 halfshafts. These were also in good working order, though they did
"click" when going in reverse. No split boots, etc. Still have plenty of
grease in them. $100 the pair.

e-mail or call me. Pick up (San Francisco) or buyer pays shipping.

>George Hussey

     I've talked to Bill Hirsch (who sells "Miracle Paint"), Eastwood (who
 sells Corroless), and "Skinned Knuckles" magazine (who sells magazines).
 They've been running rust tests on competitive products, I've sent off
 for their articles on the results.

     From what I can gather;
    * Corroless is a 38 year old British product, developed for off-shore
      oil platforms. Only sold in the US thru Eastwood, it is a "fortified
      enamel."
    * Miracle-paint and POR-15 are "water hardened polyurethanes." I got a
      vague "no" when I asked Bill Hirsch if their Miracle Paint and POR-15
      were the same product (they are available in the same colors, for about
      the same price, and about the same claims). Both claim incredible film
      strength, adhesion, immunity to solvents/acids/salt/brake fluid;
      Miracle paint claims it will reliably seal gas tank leaks up to the size
      of a dime....(back the whole with cloth, fill the tank, remove the
      backing. Hey, its just flammable..)
    * Bill Hirsch advises brushing miracle paint on, not over scale but that
      its not necessary to remove the rust. They claim their adhesion is so
      good they include rubber gloves (or you can't get it off your skin;
      however the truth may be that the stuff is that toxic (Eastwood was
      quick to point out that POR-15 contains iso-cyanides). Bill Hirsch also
      sells a thinner for Miracle paint. I got a vague answer on whether
      Miracle Paint could be sprayed (if adhesion is what they say, will it
      come off my gun?).
          As far as UV sensitivity, JC Whitney sells a "Miracle paint" (for
      about the same price/same claims) but warns that it needs to be
      topcoated. Bill Hirsch denies theirs is so sensitive, and claims they've
      had excellent results using it over their warehouse floor (in clear).
    * Neither Eastwood or Bill Hirsch publish any type of comparison with
      the other guys. I'm skeptical that the "big guys" (PPG, DuPont) don't
      have anything with similar claims (and I worry they are simply
      responsible) but "Skinned Knuckles" magazine claims that Corroless
      and POR-15 are their top-2 choices for Rust converters/primers. They
      haven't tested Miracle paint but have heard good about it.

       I haven't tried either, but I have had the experience once of trying
      to remove primer on some Taiwanese sheetmetal---the nasty paint stripper
      I use wouldn't faze it--not a bubble, no softening, not even a change
      in gloss--and since I've wondered what the hell they used.
      
       Any chemists out there who know what this stuff is ???

Subject: re: re: CA smog/912/Webers


Stan,
Thanks for your $.02. I have a couple of points I think are relavant.
 I think that a Weber conversion is less expensive than you say. I got a set of brand new
 Weber IDF40's (Italian ones) with K&N aircleaners for $300. They were not jetted correctly
 though. So I got some replacement emulsion tubes and fuel jets from PMO for about $40 (I
 think???) I put them onto the 12 and they work great!  Much better than the Solexes. So
 we're upto $340 and some time. But the time is free and also a part of owning an older 
Porsche. I know, the Solexes have larger venturies but they also had the worn throttle 
shaft problem so common to  Solex pII40s. As for replacing the Solexes; I found some new
 one for about $600 per carb. That's $1200 for  both! Onto get the old ones rebuilt, well,
 I think they can be done but you really need some one who can machine the throttle bodies 
correctly i.e. drill it straight or your back to buying new. I asked the local guru about 
this process of drilling and he claims it's a 50/50 chance of getting it drilled correctly.
Back to the original smog question though; I have results from smog tests with both sets of 
carbs and the webers produce less emissions. I just can't understand why CARB is so reluctant 
to add these carbs to the "accepable" list. I know that original replacements are around but
 how do they guage when the supply runs out. This is just my additional $.02.

For the back of my 911:

I always just put a block of wood on my jack and slid it under the
engine to the rear of the sump screen. With both wheels off the ground
I put jack stands under the point at which the body seams turn inward
for the fire wall (which is supposed to be the strongest part of a 911).
Most of my p-car friends do it the same way and non have ever had any
damage. I *have* seen damage from the jack plates, both to the jack 
"socket" and to the rocker panel. The first time I lifted the car under
the engine, I kind of cringed, but virtually everybody at the track 
seems to do it that way, and I've seen many pictures of 911 racing cars
lifted that way. When you think of the normal stresses on the engine
and mounts, lifting the body isn't excessive. Any other opinions? 
Flames?

There were some plastic 914 kits in the early 70's but have not seen 
anything in many years.  Solido (French) had a 914 diecast 1/43 scale of 
the same vintage, I have a yellow and black one in my collection.  I 
believe that they may have reissued that model several years ago and may 
be available from sources like EWA.  I can look in the last Danhausen 
catalog (1992) to see if they show any others.  Schuco may have had a 
diecast and there may be some white-metal or resin kits as well.

About handheld CBs... be sure to get a small whip antanne  ( 2 - 4 feet)
and something in the 4-5 watt range as far as the transciever power goes.
The rubber ducky antannes that come with most handhelds aren't good for
much.

I have been *really* happy with the Freodo AF pads in my '80 'SC.

My car is a street/auto-x car.  These pads require no warm-up
but work effectively auto-xing

Automotion (blech) has them.  I don't know who else.  Imparts doesn't.

It's probably the windshield.

My girlfriend had this problem with her '81 'sc.

She used a permatex windshield silicone sealant and the problem seems to 
be gone.  This was after having the seal replaced *and* sealed.

I believe the sealant goes between the glass and seal and between the paint 
and seal on the outside.

[I forgot to post my phone number the first time ...]

Now that I've overhauled my 914 I have these items for sale:

914-4 rear brake calipers.  These were in good working order when they came
off my car last summer. Complete, nothing frozen, with pads. Passenger-side
unit's rigid brake line is still attached 'cause someone rounded off the
nut's edges and I didn't want to deal with it. $100 ea., $175 the pair.

914-4 halfshafts. These were also in good working order, though they did
"click" when going in reverse. No split boots, etc. Still have plenty of
grease in them. $100 the pair.

e-mail or call me. Pick up (San Francisco) or buyer pays shipping. 
(415) 334-3925.

Think again. Include in your price the need for new intake manifolds or

Sure. So how old is the car and how  often have you had to replace
the carbs? So what's that in $/year?? And if you'd like a real shock,
go price a carb for a late large-block Ford, like one of the CV carbs
from the mid-80s or so... The price is *COMPLETELY REASONABLE* when
you consider the market size, and what OTHER carbs sell for.

I'm glad I don't have to depend on him for my other machine work. This is

Not in my experience in Southern CA, can't speak for elsewhere. Take too 
much effort to go after all the Porsches here (g)

There is no question, however, that color has a direct bearing. I used to 
have a silver 944T which didn't seem to attract much attention. A friend had 
the same car in Guards Red. We compared notes from time to time. He was 
followed regularly by the CHP, which I wasn't, and got more tickets than I 
did. Driving similarly, in style and mileage, I was clearly at less risk, at 
least from the CHP. Too bad, because I really liked the red. My 911 is blue, 
and seems to cause the same relative indifference. 

A few years ago, at traffic school (for those who haven't had the pleasure, 
it is a CA way of not having tickets go on your record), the instructor had 
statistics relating tickets and colors. Red, compared to anything else was a 
disaster, outdid the next color by over 2X. Based on that, I would never own 
a red car of any kind in CA, unless it is a 356 Speedster which only seems 
to attract a positive reaction (g).

For newer cars, (mine is a 1991 944S2), Porsche maintains a database which 
contains the code for each stereo based on the serial number (found on the back 
of the unit).  

Both dealers in town were able to access the code number on-line based on this 
serial number (some confusion here, as the first dealer wasn't sure whether to 
use the serial number or another number off the back of the stereo).  Best bet 
is to get all of the numbers off the back of the unit.

On my model (the "Stuttgart (sp?)"), the code is entered as follows (let's use 
the code number "8027" for this example):

[1]  Turn the power on to the stereo and turn it on
[2]  Wait until the word "code" is displayed
[3]  Enter the code by 
     - pressing the #1 key 8 times, 
     - pressing the #3 key 2 times, and 
     - pressing the #4 key 7 times.  
     Each digit on the display is incremented each time the corresponding key 
     is pressed.  
[4]  When your code number is displayed, hit the "rocker switch" (on my stereo 
     it is on the bottom right hand corner and is the tuner during normal use),
     and your stereo should immediately begin to work

Now that my stereo works again, I remembered how mediocre the sound is.  Next 
step is to improve the sound quality, while leaving the factory stereo in place.
Any thoughts?

I want (have) to change my trans oil for my 83 911SC. I have phoned 
around to some dealers, and the consensus is that Swepco is the best
(quote : "The ONLY oil to use" ) for the tranny. However, up here in

First of all, is this the oil of choice, and is this price reasonable?

        As of a couple of years ago, black was also on the "hit list".
White cars got the most tickets, mostly because more cars were white
than any other color, but per-car, red and black were the worst.

Pete,
The new BFG road racing tires have a treadwear index of 50 and are real
sticky. I can't speak for autoX but they are great on a road course. Lap
times have been plummeting lately and I feel that it is the tire technology,
at least to a considerable extent.
The 50 rating is a bit deceptive as they are really very good at lasting a
long time. I got 12 track days out of my last pair and they still had plenty
of life, albeit no tread. They are now, for all intents and purposes,  slicks
and as such are illegal in Club Racing. For just track events they have at
least another weekend to goat the instructor level.

A not-bad start is to buy a study guide, available at Radio Shack, or your

I've also used it with near boiling water to clean off engine parts, it

If you go look at the car make sure you look for rust everywhere.

Eventhough the car once lived in California, it depends where in California.
This is probably a mute point anyway. Since the car has lived in Chicago for
10 years, it sounds like the climate has caused some damage . If the rust is
that noticable on the right panel, make sure you look at the metal supporting
the front suspension. 

My '70 911E only spent the first year of it life in Europe, the remaining
years have been in sunny (now flooded) Southern California. The suspension
pan devolped severe rust and had to be replaced. Make sure you check this
out. Another area you need to check is the bottom of the doors. If the drain
holes have become plugged (they do over time) water will do its dasterly deed
just sitting there. Many body shops will cover this over with Bondo.
Depending on the climate, it may take three to four years for the rust to
become visable again. If you are serious, take a small magnet with you. If
there is enough Bondo, the magnet will not stick.

Personally, I would be cautious - have a professional check the car out.

the guy is on the up and up, he won't mind if you have the car checked out.

A new throttle switch cured the problem.  There were two errors in my
previous posts, however.  First, the switch only senses idle/off-idle,
not full throttle.  This became obvious after cutting open the old
switch and seeing only one (broken) microswitch that is operated when
the throttle is closed.  Second, even though the switch is mounted on
the side of the throttle body, rather than underneath it as on some
other 944s, you still need to remove the throttle body to get a clear
shot at one of the screws fastening the switch.  Fortunately, this
is pretty straightforward anyway.

Hi phellow P-philers!

I read with interest the criticisms of SCCA's rules policy for Solo. 
There's a major misconception among PCA members about SCCA Stock, which
is that SCCA Stock allowances should parallel PCA Stock.  Well, they
don't! 

SCCA Stock is, pretty much, stock!  As in, "as delivered".  PCA Stock
allows a neat and thoughtful combination of upgrades in motor,
suspension, and other parts that enthusiasts like to change.  This is not
to say that one is better than the other, just that they are different. 
SCCA has no quarrel with this level of preparation, in fact we have a
category that's conceptually similar!  In SCCA it's called "Street
Prepared".  It allows, if I may paraphrase, bolt on engine componentry
(intake, fuel injection or carburation, headers, etc even if not
originally equipped) and enough suspension tweaks to keep you smilin' til
your bank accout hit's empty!  It's likely that a fully equipped SCCA
Street Prepared car exceeds PCA rules somewhat here and there, and that a
fully equipped PCA Stock car exceeds SCCA SP rules here and there, but
conceptually the classes are very similar.  And it's very likely that the
majority of Porschephiler's well prepared PCA Stock Porsches will compete
very nicely and very competitively in local SCCA Street Prepared
competition!  At a national level of course, as in PCA, you're better off
with a car optimized to the particular rule set.

Don't damn SCCA for allowing two distinctly different versions of
streetable Porsches to compete!  SCCA Stock provides a place for those of
us who really haven't done anything to our Porsche a place to play and be
very competitive!  I know.  I won a the SCCA D Stock National
Championship in 1993 driving a Porsche 914 1.7.  The car was "as
delivered" except: muffler, air filter, shocks, front sway bar, a truly
wild alignment, and tires.  My new 944 S2 will be a national caliber B
Stocker with only air filter, alignment and tires!  Would these cars
equipped this way be competitive in the Porsche Parade?  Not terribly. 

In SCCA you have a choice of streetable preperation levels.  Why should
that be considered a "Communist Act"?  :-)

Lastly, the reference to the SCCA's SEB (Solo Events Board) as "Porsche
haters, Lotus lovers" amused me greatly.  You see, I'm a member of this
eight person board, and in this capacity I read every week how we are out
to get MR2's, Corvettes, RX7's, Honda's, BMW's, Mustang's, and yes even
Loti and Porsches!  If we were out to get everyone who thought we were
out to get 'em you could only be safe driving Studebakers and Hudsons!  

For the record, in the last 22 years SCCA Solo National Championships have
been claimed by Stock category marques as follows: Porsche 42; Lotus 9;
Studebaker & Hudson 0.  It's not time to trade in that 911 on a
Hawk or a Hornet just yet! :-) 

Byron "but you can call me Communist Asshole" Short :-)

Sorry, while that does get some folks upset, that's not my beef. In
fact, I'd be *HAPPY* if the stock rules were enforced harder on both
Solo II and more particularly Showroom Stock (I'll tell you about the
Miata with the NO2 setup sometime if you like... wasn't caught in 
impound for about a year and a half!)

FYI, I ran my 911 bone stock, even running with the spare tire and trunk
crap loaded for several years without noticable impact on my win
record in PCA events. So you *DON'T* need to run a "prepared to the 
limit of stock" rules car...

> In SCCA you have a choice of streetable preperation levels.  Why should
> that be considered a "Communist Act"?  :-)

No, it's not. But the lack of any sanity in *PROGRESSION* from Stock
to Street Prepared to Prepared is a major problem... Most particularly
the SP -> P step. I'll admit, SportsCar just came today so I haven't
had a chance to read and digest the new Prepared rules, so I may be
all wet (i.e. that may be fixed now). 

I also have significant problems with the disparity  in "prep to GCR"
versus "prep to SoloII rules" while running in the same class.  As noted,
I usually solve this by not running SCCA Solo II events.

Subject: Re:  CA 912 Smog Test.

Dear Sean:

         The CA boys are right- Webers aren't Legal in CA. HOWEVER they can
easily be adjusted to pass the CA smog test, so ifin you get a tester to test
'em and you pass, you pass! The easiest way is to take the car to the station
with the LEAST amount of Porsche knowledge- like a Hyuandi repair shop with a
smog license. If you want to have a higher probability of passing, use the
trumpet-type 912 Air Filters, drill out the base plate to match the 4 studs
of the Weber and fit the 912 Air filters to your Webers. The smog lines hook
up like they're made to, since they are, and with this arrangement, the
Webers look a lot like Solexes- enough so the Average Smog Mechanic can't
tell the difference and will give you the test.
      Weber went through the BAR's hoops to get several models legal in CA
for the HonDatToys, but decided that it wasn't worth it for Porsches as, with
the sliding 20-year rule, they would be exempt by 1989. Unfortunately, the
Smog Boys CHANGED THE RULES (LAW), and now everything after 1966  is NOT
exempt and has to have the Original Equipment and go through the bi-annual
test!  (Please note that everything  BEFORE 1966 IS exempt, which means that
ALL 356's do NOT need a smog test- EVER!  I sure like the ring of that!)
     It is still possible to rebuild the Solexes for about the same cost as a
set of Webers, including replacing the throttle shafts and putting bronze
bushings in as well as machining all surfaces and untrasonic cleaning of the
throttle body, as we do this all the time, but New Webers with ball bearings
in the throttle shafts and ease of main jet/air correction jet/ emusion tube
changing OUGHT to be legal- especially if they PASS THE DAMN TEST! (IMHO.)
You may thank you Loco State/Federal Gumnt for this asinine law.

  And KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!

Subject: RE: Jacking up a Porsche

I use a small floor jack and a jack plate from Automation for lifting my 911.
The jack plate is very sturdy, coated to prevent rust, and has never caused
any damage to my car. I use hockey pucs (hard rubber) between the floor jack
and the jack plate. This protects the metal coating on the jack plate and
provides a flexable "joint" between the floor jack and jack plate. The
rubber has a good grip and adjusts with the difference in angles between
the floor jack and jack plate while lifting the car.

To lift the rear of the car, I jackup one side (both wheels off the floor) and
place a jack stand, with a saddle type head, under the end of the torsion bar
tube located in the rear wheel well. I bought some heavy clear plastic tubing
and split it to go over the saddle head of the jack stand, This prevents metal
to metal contact with the car, saving the paint/coating on the torsion tubes.
I then lower the jack (front wheel returns part way to the ground) and repeat
the procedure on the other side of the car.

To lift the front of the car, I follow the same procedure. but use jack stands
with flat heads and hockey pucs to hold the front up at the corner of the
floor pan (as shown in the owners manual).

The only concern that I have ever had is that the doors are harder to close
while the rear of the car is off of the floor. I suspect that this is due to
body flex. After returning the car to the ground, the doors work fine. Has
anyone else noticed this ? Also, the procedure that I described makes the
flex from side to side since one side is up and the other down for a short
period of time. I have never had any problems with the handling after this
so I suspect the car can take this OK. All comments are welcome!

Hi Arthur.

Ummmm, well...have you been visited lately by the local rep from the 
SPISBDBATSPNY (Society for the Prevention of Inevitable and Serious Body Damage 
to Beautiful Automotive Toys from Street Parking in New York)?

I remember one December night in 1960 when I parked my '56 Karman Ghia
on Riverside Drive in Yonkers.  No, I lied... what I remember is the morning
AFTER I parked it.  I went out to find the left side "ironed" flat, from
some *kind* hearted soul...  Really wierd, the street was straight as an
arrow for at least two blocks in either direction, and pleanty wide...

But I guess New Yorkers have significantly improved both their driving
skills and their manners, since that unfortunate day.  OK, not to worry...

never saw it, but my boss suddenly commanded "@#$%, Look out, Turn quick".
The bottle glanced off the right front fender about 6" in front of the

I have owned two different Porsches now for almost 5 years (a relative 
newcomer) and my experience has been not discernably different than other 
vehicles I have owned.  I always try to park in out of the way places, end 
of rows, wide spaces, etc.  While I like to drive fast when suitable I also 
try not to attract any unwanted attention.  No double space parking, no 
engaging those individuals with a chip on their shoulder, etc.  

You've got to be careful where you park any nice car esp. a Porsche since 
they don't have any defensive rubber on the car sides to prevent dings, 
chips, and dents.  I has been my experience that if you park a car in a 
parking lot like most people it will get dinged and chipped, fact of life.  

My advice is buy it, take care of it, park it away for other cars, and have 
fun.

In  a response to my previous message on whether or not to buy a 924S or a
924  Byron D. Short wrote.

>ARE YOU NUTS?!  Oops, not as delicate as I had planned!  Sorry. Start over.
The 924S is a FABULOUS Porsche among the water pumpers.  It is, as you
say, a 944 in the lighter body of a 924.  IOW, it's typically quicker than
a 944, and since it's also a little narrower it's the C Stock weapon of
choice over the 944.  Best of all, many (I've heard "all" but I can't
confirm) of these cars came with the M030 suspension, which would account
for it's responsiveness <end quote>

Well I haven't been accused of being real sane since I am buying a Porsche
but I did decide to get the 924S.  I should be picking it up this weekend,
and I got for 3k which from what I understand is pretty good on the price.
 As Byron said the main reason to get one of these cars is the fact that they
tend to be lighter and quicker than a comparable 944.  The main question I
have is ,  Why would anyone disconnect the power steering and is there any
reason I can't just remove the damn thing?  As far as I am concerned the only
vehicle that *needs* power steering is a tank or a semi-truck.

Byron-->  I will check to see if it has the M030 suspension when I pick it
up, can you tell me what more about it or recommend a good book on Porsche
suspensions.  I haven't found much in any of the Dallas bookstores.

When I put my '87 944 up on stands, I place the rear jack stands under the 
torsion tubes as well (this thread was about 911's) but I dont place
them at the ends that stick out of the tube (Im assuming there are some 
similarities between the two cars tubes), but somwhat closer to the middle 
where the tube is much thicker.  I was really worried about doing this the 
first couple of times, but so-far nothing has bent or deformed etc. 

Any comments on this placement for a 944?

(stuff deleted)

My 944's doors are somewhat out of alignment when the whole car is up on 
stands, not enough so you can see it, but when you open and close them, you 
can tell that the latches do not line up like they do when the car is 
suspended from the wheels. Also, it is nearly impossible to latch the 
hatchback once it has been opened.  As with W.P.'s 911, all these symptoms 
go away once the car is back on its wheels.  

As for the front of the car, I place jack stands under the "beams" molded
into the unit body floor of the car.  I make sure to align the top of 
the stand with the section of the "beam" that is composed of two 
overlapping thicknesses of sheet metal.  I really hate doing this  because
it creates damage to the underbody coating and does a tiny amout of damage
to the metal itself.  I dont use wood or any sort of pad because Im really
paranoind about having the car squish me like a bug while Im working on it,
but I think Ill try the tubing idea here also.  

Comments, advice ?

In general, Houston has been a good place for my cars. The 911 was Grand
Prix White, and as a result nearly completely invisible to the cops. Too
many people tooling around in triple black turbos and guards red cabs
to pay attention to a white 911, I guess.

Parking is seldom something I worry about. You park the car, you come back,
if there are dents/dings/etc, then that's just entropy. If I can't deal
with that, then I shouldn't be driving then car. As it turns out, I have
cars that fall into that category; they DO NOT get driven anyplace
that I have to leave them -- outdoor cafes are fine, but even the post office
is a no-no. None of my 914s or 356s, or the 911SC have fallen into that
category though. And I can't imagine owning a newer Porsche and feeling
that way - even a new 993 or Boxter.

> With "few exceptions", I've had nothing but admiring glances.  Now for the

And then there's the "I guess this is admiring" category. Just before
Christmas, I was at the Galleria, doing some last minute shopping. In
the 356, of course. So when I was done, I headed back to the car just in
time to see a trio of obviously high-school girls sort of wandering in
circles around my car. I heard one say "But it's SOOOOoooo *OLD*". Another
said "Maybe but it's really cute" to which the third responded "Yeah, sort
of like Dillon's car, with a hat on." They scattered when I got closer,
figuring that I had to be at least as old as the car...

Sigh. That's what too much TV will do for you I guess...

Subject: Answer to vibration & idle probs.

Greetings Philers!

I think I figured out why my idle is high (and climbing); why the car 
takes two tries to start when cold, and what what the vibration problem 
is.

It seems the previous owner may have upped the idle to 1100rpm in my 951S 
to cover up a bad passenger side motor mount!  

I remember from previous 944 experiences that a bad passenger motor mount 
will cause the car and steering wheel to vibrate at idle.  This tends to 
smooth out over 1000rmp.  Since mine idles at 1100, I really never noticed 
it; UNTIL, I turned on the AC when the car was cold and it began idling at 
850.  Lots of vibration then.  I thought to myself, "I've had this problem 
before."  

So, if I could get a little bit of net wisdom to check my logic:

1) Bad passenger motor mount causes car and steering wheel to vibrate at 
idle.

2) Less than honest seller ups the idle to 1100rmp to hide problem.  Says 
that car has a small vacuum leak.

3) High idle and hard start are due to car's systems (brain?) having 
problems dealing the the higher than normal idle setting.

4) Fixing the motor mount and readjusting the idle should fix the 
vibrations, idle creep and hard starting.

George, everybody, does this should plausible or did I miss something?

Thank you all for your help!!!

Subject: '72S versus '74S

Mike and Eric,

The two cars are really very different:

'72S: old body style, MFI, 190 hp, 2.4-max displacement on mag case without
problems, built in oil cooler radiator (the loop-cooler came in '73) Classic
"S" ride but with reasonable low end torque.

'74S: newer body style, a little heavier, 175 HP with CIS.  2.7 liter, most
with case problems.  Last of the non-smog cars (good from that standpoint).
 aux-oil -cooler not standard but avialable.  Nice driver, less cam.  Not as
quick or fast as the '72S.  Published Top end on '72 is 143 mph and '74 is
137, I beleive.

Mike is right, with flares added and a few options the '74S can become a
Carrera; the engines were the same unless you find a euro-Carrera which had
the 911.83 "RS" 210 hp motor (great car!).  Most Carrera's had ext. loop oil
coolers, power windows, etc.

I put 100k on a '74S and now have a '72S.

Hello Porschephilers,

This has been bugging me for a while now.
My '75 914 1.8L didn't have a catalytic converter on it when I bought it.  It just has a straight pipe
connecting the primary and secondary mufflers.  I don't know if the previous owner removed it,
or if it came from the factory without one.  I believe the 914 was originally a California car.  At
least I bought it in California back in '86 when I lived there and the owners manual has service
stamps from California Porsche dealers.  The car always passed the emission tests and the
guys doing the testing never bothered to check the exhaust system for a converter.  Of course
the "You pass or you don't pay" places that I went to have a lot of motivation to pass the car. 
Here in Minnesota, testing starts with the '76 model year so I just squeeked by!

Did all '75 and '76 914's have catalytic converters?  Just the 2.0L models?  Were 914's sold in
California equipped differently than the others?

Thanks for any info,
Pete

These "blocks" will *NOT* prevent tensioner failure. They just prevent
total collapse of the piston. The tensioner can fail and you may never know

DON'T BUY FROM TWINKS!!! I have never found any product in a Twinks catalog

the slick catalog and their inept staff. I don't mind paying high prices if
you get something in return, such as Stoddard's expertise, and quick and

This price is about $5.50 to $7.00 higher than the same product, seen yesterday
at the local VW hot rod shop (Kymco, Costa Mesa, CA). And swap meet prices are
typcially $30 a gallon (Troutman usually brings a few gallons of 201 to the
Pomona swap meets; his non-swap meet price is probably higher).
 
(Later)
I just called Kymco, confirmed that their price is $39.99, and that they
will ship, with Visa or Mastercard. Their number is 714-642-1835. Since
Kymco and Twinks' Long Beach shop are only about 20 miles apart, I can't
imagine shipping being that much different for people who are, say, west of
the Mississippi and don't use the Twinks Indianapolis operation.
 
The other source, Troutman, can be reached at 1-800-356-9307 or

is indeed $30. Go for it.

Surely this comes under "use your nut"

If I am tooling along a country lane and I see an unattended  horse on the 
verge, I assume that it will bolt at any moment.

If I see a person on a bridge, I try to avoid passing directly under him 
especially if he is in a "high risk" category.

There are plently of other things to look out for eg bendy road, lots of

Hmmm, this sounds a little odd, since I have been told that almost all of the

everyday use.  Still, I suppose they're out there somewhere.
	
	Well I haven't been accused of being real sane since I am buying a Porsche
	but I did decide to get the 924S.  I should be picking it up this weekend,

	reason I can't just remove the damn thing? As far as I am concerned the only
	vehicle that *needs* power steering is a tank or a semi-truck.

Apparently this is a pretty common failure mode for the 944.  I know I passed
on an '86 951 because when I put it up on the rack there was a lot of PS fluid
dripping from somewhere.  I would imagine that the previous owner had a leak
and just disconnected the pump to stop it.  Given the price of steering racks,
you may want to just leave it disconnected.

Good luck with the car -- I'm sure you'll love it!

Swepco gets MY vote, also in an '83 SC.  I first tried Valvoline, then
Redline MTL (good in my BMW experience), finally coughed up the $$ for
Swepco.  BIG improvement in the lame 2nd gear synchro with the initial
fill-up, and a small improvement with each change since (6 each @ 15k
miles...).  The price sucks, I'm sure there's a truck stop somewhere
that would fill a milk jug with it for $10, but so far I've paid the
boutique prices... so far it's cheaper than the OTHER solution to the
2nd gear synchro problem.

Not much of one. . .  My 73 was originally a 2.0 and Steve Compton helped
me get it legal and competitive.  Unfortunately I was in his class, he
drove a 74 914 2.0, so through the course of our Pro Solo seasons we took
just enough points away from each other to truly annoy.  In the winter we
began to look over the specs on the 1.7, which at that time was down one
class in DS.  The popular wisdom was that the car couldn't compete, but we
felt it would dominate any tight track and we could let the Hondas and
Nissans split wins on the open courses.  It worked well for both of us. 
Steve went on to the CS National Championship while I won the DS title and
the Sexy-Mexi (my wife Yvonne) took runner up in DSLadies.  Along the way
not everything went well, as you SCCA regulars will remember. . .but

This price is about $5.50 to $7.00 higher than the same product, seen yesterday
at the local VW hot rod shop (Kymco, Costa Mesa, CA). And swap meet prices are
typcially $30 a gallon (Troutman usually brings a few gallons of 201 to the
Pomona swap meets; his non-swap meet price is probably higher).
 
(Later)
I just called Kymco, confirmed that their price is $39.99, and that they
will ship, with Visa or Mastercard. Their number is 714-642-1835. Since
Kymco and Twinks' Long Beach shop are only about 20 miles apart, I can't
imagine shipping being that much different for people who are, say, west of
the Mississippi and don't use the Twinks Indianapolis operation.
 
The other source, Troutman, can be reached at 1-800-356-9307 or
1-619-699-9277 (Temecula, CA). I just called there and confirmed, the price
is indeed $30. Go for it.

I will be changing the oil in my 82 sc soon too.  I had originally
intended to use synthetic but worried about reputed problems with
changing to synth if it's really dirty in there.  Looking at the tranny
and trying to budge the plugs i'm not sure my tranny oil has EVER been
changed.  My plan now is to put new valvoline in for a few thousand miles
(probably around 2k) as an intermediate "flush" oil change then move to
synthetic.  does this sound reasonable ?

     Uh, sorry George, but I talked to POR-15 (800-45-POR15) who says that
 POR-15 -IS- UV sensitive and must be topcoated !  This is the same
 recommendation JC Whitney makes for their "Miracle Paint" but was denied
 via example by Bill Hirsch for -their- "Miracle Paint" (eg, they used it as
 topcoat over a cement floor). Makes you wonder why they bother selling
 3 colors (clear, silver, black--again, just like "Miracle Paint") when you
 have to topcoat anyways, or how much you buy (for brake fluid or battery
 acid immunity) when your weakest link in the chain is the topcoat...

     I asked POR-15 if their stuff is the same as "Miracle Paint" but got
 the same vague, delayed "I don't know" answer that Bill Hirsch gave me.
 Bill Hirsch claims they tried POR-15 but it didn't work well in a battery
 box; yet POR-15 claims to be immune to battery acids....Hmmm, maybe JC
 Whitney has a tech help line (ooohhhh...).
         
     Bottom line, apparently POR-15 and Corroless and Miracle Paint all
 make great rust primers, probably better than Dp-90 or Dupont's epoxy
 primers. POR-15 and Bill Hirsch make great marketers too; and make me really
 wish I could get a straight answer (or just a convincing response !). 
 I'm tempted to order a can from either, look at the source of manufacture
 and ingredients to compare--but then again.....

In  a response to my previous message on whether or not to buy a 924S or a
924  Byron D. Short wrote.

>ARE YOU NUTS?!  Oops, not as delicate as I had planned!  Sorry. Start over.
The 924S is a FABULOUS Porsche among the water pumpers.  It is, as you
say, a 944 in the lighter body of a 924.  IOW, it's typically quicker than
a 944, and since it's also a little narrower it's the C Stock weapon of
choice over the 944.  Best of all, many (I've heard "all" but I can't
confirm) of these cars came with the M030 suspension, which would account
for it's responsiveness <end quote>

Well I haven't been accused of being real sane since I am buying a Porsche
but I did decide to get the 924S.  I should be picking it up this weekend,
and I got for 3k which from what I understand is pretty good on the price.
 As Byron said the main reason to get one of these cars is the fact that they
tend to be lighter and quicker than a comparable 944.  The main question I
have is ,  Why would anyone disconnect the power steering and is there any
reason I can't just remove the damn thing?  As far as I am concerned the only
vehicle that *needs* power steering is a tank or a semi-truck.

Byron-->  I will check to see if it has the M030 suspension when I pick it
up, can you tell me what more about it or recommend a good book on Porsche
suspensions.  I haven't found much in any of the Dallas bookstores.

Hi Chris,

Hmmmmm...We haven't been out on our own for very long, have we?  (he said with
a big grin on his silly gesicht...)  In many parts of the world, including many
parts of the the good ol' US and A, the ability to accurately answer your 
question is (all too frequently) all the separates the quick from the dead.

But, since we all gotta start somewhere (the old soldier reluctantly said, with 
a pained expression on his ugly mug), if you see *any* person standing on a 
highway over-pass, you might reasonably consider that person to be a potential 
malefactor on that ground alone.  (Unless you're in West Virginia, in which 
case you can relax, it's just one of the local citizens out for the excitment 
of seein' all them cars movin' on a *flat* surface.)

If that person is also apparently a *young* person, (we all know how prone to 
mischief the young can be), you would be advised to increment the threat
rating at least one click.  Of course, the earlier exception still applies, 
and, naturally, I could be mistaken.  Sure! Lots of youngsters go watch 
traffic when there's nothing on MTV...

If said YP has a hat on backwards, and is apparently keenly observing the 
on-comming traffic below, increment the threat factor another click or two.

If said YP is further observed to be holding anything in aloft, say a large
rock or chunk of concrete...[the remainder of this is left as an exercise for 
the stoont...]

Porschephiles,

My 944 has been suffering from a vibration when in reverse gear. Back when
the car was inspected prior to my purchasing it, the mechanic pointed out
that the vibration indicated motor mounts needed replacement. Turbo upgrade
mounts were procured and taken to a local P-mechanic for installation.
Well, the vibration in reverse persists.  There is no noticeable vibration
at idle (which BTW is not set to 1100 rpm), so I do not plan to readjust
the idle just yet.

At this point I am assuming that the mechanic did his job and the mounts
were installed correctly. What other sources are known to cause this
vibration? 

Thank you all for being a constant source of great information .

The racks tend to leak, so one choice is to drain the system and remove
the pump.  If you want to fix the rack there was a thread about this in
just the last couple weeks.  Removing the power steering (and possibly
installing it on any tanks you may have parked in the back yard <g>) is a
good idea for street use; not legal for SCCA stock, I'm sure another
'philer can advise you regarding PCA stock?

The BEST book is the full Porsche workshop manual series, about $350. The
best book priced within reason, however, is the PORSCHE 944/924S
Technical Specifications book, also direct from Porsche, about $12 I
think.  It's tiny size (about 3.5" X 4.5") conceals a wealth of
knowledge, including such oddities as M030 spring rates versus standard,
sway bars, shocks, etc.  Worth almost as much as the full shop manual
series, but don't tell that to Porsche!

From: pete.klager

Hello Porschephilers,

This has been bugging me for a while now.
My '75 914 1.8L didn't have a catalytic converter on it when I bought it. 
 It
just has a straight pipe
connecting the primary and secondary mufflers.  I don't know if the previous
owner removed it,
or if it came from the factory without one.  I believe the 914 was 
originally
a California car.  At
least I bought it in California back in '86 when I lived there and the 
owners
manual has service
stamps from California Porsche dealers.  The car always passed the emission
tests and the
guys doing the testing never bothered to check the exhaust system for a
converter.  Of course
the "You pass or you don't pay" places that I went to have a lot of
motivation to pass the car.
Here in Minnesota, testing starts with the '76 model year so I just squeeked
by!

Did all '75 and '76 914's have catalytic converters?  Just the 2.0L models?
Were 914's sold in
California equipped differently than the others?

Thanks for any info,

Hi, Tim,

I just acquired a set of the 944 factory service manuals on microfiche for
@26 from Stoddard.

The PCNA part number is PNA 000 127.  The part number for the 944 Turbo
service manyal is PNA 000 126 (cost is $12 for that item.)

The manuals seem to be complete, if a bit difficult to use, but I understand
that Xerox used to do some work in micrography, so you might be able to 
use this information more than others...

Hi, Rolando,

We will need a bit more information about your car:

1) 5 Speed or Automatic?

2) If 5 speed, any vibration in any other gear?

3) If 5 speed, clutch pedal in or out?

4) Describe the vibration:  Felt in seat of pants, steering wheel, Shift
Knob, other?

5) Any other oddities about the car? 

6) What year is the car? What transmission options (LSD)?

7) Any other observations about the vibration (e.g. only when cold, never
when cold, just after putting it into reverse, when stopping from reversing,
etc.)

Sorry to be such a pain about the symptoms, but the only other alternative
is for you to bring it by and show me ...   :-)

geeze, you're 70ish and and haven't learned...

the us traffic courts (only ones I have any experience with) are not there to
mete out justice...

they're there to generate revenue for the municipality.

that it, nothing more than that.

when you couple that with the cops - a job where the desire to be one
is concrete evidence of the unsuitability of the individual for the job - 
and mayors courts - where public prosecutors frequently sit as judges - 
you have a nightmare.

sorry 'bout your experience.  perhaps we should call it taxation without

Yep, I've got the tick counter.  My indicator lights have never gone off.

My 1.8L doesn't have an air pump.  I think only the 2.0L's did.

Maybe what happened is that the cat "change me" light went off on the
previous owner (or the cat plugged up) and they changed it by putting in
the straight pipe and then disconnected all the "change me" electrics.

You can use the torsion bar carrier, either inside or outside the member
you mention.  Or the control arm pick-ups, or the frame rails.  There is
also, of course, the side-centre pads and the official dimples at the four
corners.  If you're jacking the car onto jackstands, generally best to
use the side-centre pad for the floor jack and the dimples for the
jack stands.  If you do use the suspension points, be a little careful.

On the 911 side of things, I recall a comment made by John Paterak a
few years back.  Apparently the 930's were heavy enough that he had
seen a number of them tear their square jack pad receiver channel
when it was used with a pad.  However, it is the best way, IMHO, to get
the job done on 911's.

Subject: Swepco

The question about SWEPCO 201 Multi-Purpose Gear Lube being worth the money
was answered by Bruce Anderson in the Technical Notes column of the December
1991 issue of Excellence. The summery is that it SWEPCO 201 is very good for
915 transmissions. One gallon is required for filling an empty 915 transmission.

Who SWEPCO is:

          Southwestern Petroleum Corporation
          PO Box 789
          Fort Worth, TX
          76101

          1-800-359-LUBE

SWEPCO 201 can be purchsed at the SWEPO facility in Fort Worth or ordered over
the telephone and shipped to you. The last price I got from them was $134 for
a case of 6 1-gallon jugs. Thats about $24 per gallon with tax for local
pickup. A case is the minimum amount sold. This will give you an idea of
the markup of products sold by big Porsche mail order operations.

Zims will pump SWEPCO 201 into a clean jug for $32 a gallon from a drum if you
stop by. If you order SWEPCO 201 by mail, they charge more since it comes in
the 1-gallon jug packaged by SWEPCO. Zims prices are always less that the
dealer and most other mail order operations. The people at Zims are always
as nice as can be and will help answer any questions, even some of the
stupid ones that I have asked while learning to maintain my car.

In order to remove the engine and trans axle from a 914 what type of jack & or

In similar form, can you jack up just the front end of a 914 to do brake work

Subject: Re: Ignition choice for a Weber'd 3.0 SC

Hi Al:

I have a 914-4, not a six, but this may be of interest to you.  The 4 has a
conventional ignition (points and a coil).  I recently replaced the points
with a Pertronix ignitor (popular with the VW crowd, fits entirely within
the distributor where the points were, it's a magnetic-type pickup).  It
works very nicely, and supposedly they've sold 1,000,000 so far. I feel
it's much better than the Allison unit, for example.

The trouble is, all their units have been for 4-cylinder cars _until right
now_.  Within a month or so a 6-cylinder version is coming out. These units
will work with the MSD 6-series (at least the 4's did).

I just bought an MSD 6AL and will be installing it on a BMW straight-six
(now w/points, later w/Pertronix).  If you like, I'll keep you informed.

Hi, Tim,

I just acquired a set of the 944 factory service manuals on microfiche for
@26 from Stoddard.

The PCNA part number is PNA 000 127.  The part number for the 944 Turbo
service manyal is PNA 000 126 (cost is $12 for that item.)

The manuals seem to be complete, if a bit difficult to use, but I understand
that Xerox used to do some work in micrography, so you might be able to 
use this information more than others...

Yep.  The book says if it isn't explicity listed it isn't allowed.  I'm going to
ask Mike Piera to submit any Porsche directives on the subject and see if we
could get a FasTrack entry on this.  Chances are not particularly good, but it's
worth getting another letter since the SEB has rolled over three and shortly
four members in the last year or so.  I can't remember if I gave my long
explanation through the whole list or just to another p-philer directly, but
I'll paraphrase the reasoning for you here.

The PCA is handling one marque and in this capacity has no difficulty dealing
with special circumstances like tensioners.  The SCCA is working with over 900
seperate models in the current Stock category listing.  Whereas PCA can and does
deal in specifics, SCCA is forced to deal in generalities.  What we pass as a
rule should apply equally to Hondas, Subarus, and the aforementioned Studebakers
and Hudsons.  

Every rule proposal to the SEB must be considered as a precedent which will be
applied to all those other 900 cars.  This breeds a paranoia that if we approve
chain tensioners on 911s the '38 Hupmobile could use this same logic to gain an
extra 2 horsepower by altering the geometry of the reverse idler muffler-cam
drive assembly to dissipate heat in the flugal joint.  Or something.  

In the final analysis SCCA tends to throw their hands up and run away.  A noble
act, I'll admit. ;-) BTW, I'm as capable as the rest at fleeing the scene of an
impending thought-process, so I'm not pointing fingers here.  
Let's take a run at it one more time, whaddya say?  I encourage Mike Piera to
get us some info on what the factory "allows", versus what they "encourage" and
what they "require" on tensioners.  Required factory directives and recalls are
legal in stock; can we show them one?  Or at least a strong factory
recommendation?  If it's an absolute imperative to have to keep from grenading
the motor, shouldn't there be a factory directive requiring them from Porsche?
Also, try to cover any possible legal methods (or lack thereof) of attaining the
same benefit.     Include your own suggested wording which covers the bases
without leaving loopholes which could allow unexpected performance-enhancing
interpretations is also a big plus.  Again, I suspect that it won't fly, but I'd
like to hear the discussions since I wasn't on the SEB the last time Mike wrote
in about it.  

By placing this here I'm trying to railroad, um er, recruit, yeah, that's it,
recruit Mike Piera for this.  Any objections Mike?  Your previous ride height
letters were noticed and discussed; you may have a better chance of getting the
collective ear of the SEB than most.

Pete,

As far as I can tell, there are at least two different kinds of 944
(Motronic) throttle switches.  The two types look similar, but can be
distinguished by the number of conductors in their DME harness
connections.

The first type consists of two microswitches only and has a
3-conductor connector.  One conductor is grounded, the second
conductor is bridged to the ground conductor by switch 1 when the
throttle is closed, and the third conductor is bridged to the ground
conductor by switch 2 when the throttle is fully open.  The opening
and closing of the two switches is effected by a rotating arm driven
by the throttle shaft.  There is no potentiometer in this type of
switch.

The other type of switch is the one I have, which incorporates a
single microswitch and a potentiometer.  The DME harness connection to
this switch has 6 conductors (3 for the pot, 2 for the switch, and one
unused).  The pot rotates with the throttle shaft, and when the
throttle is closed, a little arm attached to the pot closes the
microswitch.  I'm not sure why the closed throttle information could
not be derived from the butterfly angle information provided by the
pot.  However, the circuit diagram I have indicates that the output of
the pot goes to the Knock Regulation Unit, whereas the output of the
microswitch goes to the DME (i.e., the DME doesn't see the pot output
directly), just like the first type of switch.  I am tempted to infer
from this that only the turbos have this second kind of switch, but I
am not sure about this.

If the "no-throttle" microswitches in either type are closed while
the engine speed is 1600 RPM or greater, the DME will shut off both
injection and ignition.  As far as I can tell, the main purpose for
this behavior is to save fuel while coasting: i.e. throttle and
microswitch are closed while engine speed remains above idle (unless
you're freewheeling with the clutch in).  Perhaps your switch is
shorting intermittently, making the DME think that the car is coasting
when it isn't.

Incidently, a new switch cost me $75.

Subject: 911-Doing the Right Thing

 I could use the group's opinion on the impending purchase of the only car
I've really wanted: a 911 . 

I've test-driven an SC81 and really enjoyed it. It would appear to be in
"average" condition with service records dating back only the past 4 years.
Now, with the collective advice of Bruce Anderson and some of the P-Philes,
I'll be taking it to a mechanic to be looked over. According to Bruce *guru*
Anderson, there two things that must be, and yet haven't been, done:

1. Replace rubber centered/"exploding" clutch with the spring centered
variety,
2. Replace the old chain tensioners with the '84+ Carrera pressure fed chain
tensioners.

 Can I expect to negotiate the cost of these repairs against the selling
price of the vehicle? And if so, by the full amount?

Thanks in advance.

Hi Al:

I have a 914-4, not a six, but this may be of interest to you.  The 4 has a
conventional ignition (points and a coil).  I recently replaced the points
with a Pertronix ignitor (popular with the VW crowd, fits entirely within
the distributor where the points were, it's a magnetic-type pickup).  It
works very nicely, and supposedly they've sold 1,000,000 so far. I feel
it's much better than the Allison unit, for example.

The trouble is, all their units have been for 4-cylinder cars _until right
now_.  Within a month or so a 6-cylinder version is coming out. These units
will work with the MSD 6-series (at least the 4's did).

I just bought an MSD 6AL and will be installing it on a BMW straight-six
(now w/points, later w/Pertronix).  If you like, I'll keep you informed.

Al,
 I have found another product that works well for 4 and 6 cylinder
applications. Crane Electronics manufactures an *optically * tiggered
replacement for points. This system is very simple to install in the base of
the distributor and is very reliable. I use it with MSD 6AL and it works
very nicely.  I think you would find it more reliable than a magnetically
triggered ignition system. If you are interested I can get  you the info on
the manufacturer etc...

Wayne - sounds like you were dead unlucky here, usually this sort of

ever do it when no one else is about.

Given two lanes to choose from I always try to avoid passing directly 
under lone youths ie take the other lane, I reason that if I take the 
other lane, at least they are presented with a more difficult shot.

This all a bit like walking under ladders - if you regularly walk under 
ladders the guy painting the upstairs window frame will drip paint from 
time to time.

There is no doubt in my mind that there is a direct link between our 
actions and the consideration we give to those actions and the results.

Given the original thread concerning p-drivers and vandalism, it is 
fairly clear to me that if you choose to park in some places you stand 
more risk of theft and vandalism. Failure to acknowledge this link is 
failure to understand (or recognise the problem)

Wayne I have sympathy with you regarding the bottle, my response was 
after all intended as a generalisation.

My assumption was based on the thought that at the National Level the PCA cars
will have optimized the car to the ruleset, and that the resulting differences
over my prep would allow an equal driver to finish me off.  You mention a rear
bar--not legal in SCCA Stock, ok in Street Prepared.  However, I had assumed
also (from the cars I see running PCA locally, although perhaps our local group
is just plain lax in rule interpretation) that non-M030 based lowering,
aftermarket springs/torsion bars, different DME (but not KLR) chips, would all
be considered legal.  Maybe someone can straighten me out on this!  BTW, I do
run the local PCA stuff, and do very well.  But maybe the Sexy-Mexi and I should
be considering putting a national PCA event or two on our '95 schedule.  Since
we already have 11 out-of-state events planned between the Pro Solo series,
National Tour series, and the National Championships, we'd likely look for
something in the western half of the country and non-conflicting with SCCA
dates.  Any suggestions?

Subject: Muffler and heat exchanger paint


I received my Pano yesterday and was very amused at an expert (Paterek)
telling someone that VHT paint was the correct paint for a 911/356/914
factory heat exchanger.

This is where the fantasy bullsh*t starts for concours/restoration. The 
Patereks do a fine job for their customers, I like their work.

In this case, however, the factory specified a paint that had a high zinc
content. It is called `cold galvanizing' in the paint trade and can be found 
in the correct gray at many local hardware stores. NOT VHT. While VHT is 
a fine finish, it is not correct.

In applying the paint to heat exchangers or mufflers, remove all scale, oil
and other drippings. Ensure that the surface is as clean as you can get it.
Paint all outer areas. Allow to dry, it takes a couple of hours. Re-install,
the heat will turn the dark gray light. 

When I last showed my '73 911S, I had just redone the exhaust system this
way. I had a lot of questions about the `original' finish. All couldn't
believe that the paint was that easy to find.

The problem with going to Parade in a real stock car is that
there is always some person there who has a read the rules and
has prepared their car to the rules and knows how to drive the
damn thing.  This is especially true where the cars are common
(911 SCs, 944s, 911 Carrerras, etc.).  If you go less than
fully prepared, you will probably settle for a less than first
place trophy. 

The other problem is the stupid PCRs.  They allow highly non-
stock cars, but the average competitor is in a mostly-stock
car.  Only those with extreme dedication really want to drive
a fully prepped car 3000 miles.  Result: Locals (who don't
have far to drive) win large amounts of heavy hardware.  Then
there are the wierd tire rules to contend with.  You can't

Hi, Bart.
 
Many many years ago, when it was still funny (1972? 1974?) National Lampoon
published a parody of "Boys Life" magazine, called "Boys Vice." In the young
scientist section, they had a deal about "Let's learn about physics" or
some such. "This month, we will examine the motion of falling bodies." They
then presented a nomogram with three axes -- speed of moving car, height of
bridge, and how many seconds before the car is under you, should you drop
the brick? Put ruler across first two axes, read off drop time from third.
 
My suggestion for fitting sentence for anybody convicted of this sort of
attempted or successfully completed murder: they get tied to the rear bumper
of a 911 and taken for a scrape around the Nuerburgring. Or 5 laps of Road
America. Hey, they're smooth roads, where's the problem, Ms. ACLU?

Bill Petersen's story about feeding the bears on the Rally:
 
Like Martin Walker says, it's not a fine, it's a tax. And it's going to get
worse, with things like Orange County suddenly finding it lost all the money
we gave them and now they want to find a way to get more out of us.
 
If Porsches get more tickets than other cars, red Porsches especially, it's
OK, it's politically correct, it's just that hidden Porsche tax that they
didn't tell you about at the dealer.
 
And when your insurance company finds out that you were an unsafe driver,
for examply by doing 50 in a 55 zone where everybody knows you should be
doing 70 to be safe, they can raise your premiums. That's politically
correct too because that takes that "disposable income" as the economists so
glibly call it, and gets it back into the economy where it will do some good.
Mainly for the insurance companies' ecnonomy, I suppose.
 
Nothing is going to change because, as Martin says, "I can't do it alone."
If drivers were as militant (in the non-lethal term) and organized as the
NRA, we wouldn't have this problem. But we're sheep, and they can fleece us
anytime they need more money. My militant solutions? Jam the courts by
appealing everything, including parking tickets. Appeal decisions. Sue
municipalities for entrapment. Get a lobby together with some tame lawyers
who will just harass the hell out of the system. (OK, I realize, we pay for
the system). Blockade roads in protest. Form moving chicanes going exactly
at the speed limit. Get the legislature to pass a bill making your driving
record inaccessible to third parties, such as insurance companies. If they
want to know how bad a driver you are, they should go by their own records
(of accident claims) or a database kept by the insurance companies for their
own collective use. Start referendums which will take police out of traffic
patrol and have them actually working to prevent crime. (This whole Clinton
"put another 100,000 cops on the street" only means we're going to have that
many more cops writing tickets. Yes, I know, the funding says they're
supposed to do real police work, not traffic, but do you believe it? Or are
they releasing other cops to do traffic?) Start a referendum that blocks
ticket revenue from going to the municipality or county; have it go to pay
for road work, traffic improvements, and such. Stop federal funding for
police overtime to do speed enforcement on interstate freeways (ever notice
how there are more cops out there on weekends? That's not their regular
shift; they're getting overtime at your federal taxdollars expense.) Stop
the federal blackmail of witholding tax revenue to states unless they can
prove compliance with the federal 55/65 mph speed limit.
 
No, I don't believe the National Motorists Association is ever going to
achieve anything, so no flames, don't tell me to join them because "it's a
start." It's a dead end road unless they get creative/militant/throw a
monkey wrench in the system.
 
BTW, Bill Petersen, was the cop who gave you a ticket local, county, or CHP?
Yes, raising bloody hell with the chamber of commerce/hotels/local mayor
can't possibly hurt. Have the other members of your club also send letters,
saying they are boycotting this town/county to the best of their ability.

The guy that got pinched in SLO was George McClelland. There is a writeup
about this in the Jan Pano. 

I've known George a long time. He probably got what he asked for. He should
get the National Dumbkopf Award for it.

This is the guy that had plastic wrapped on the tires of his 928 so they
wouldn't get dirty going to the 90 Parade concours site. I also came close 
to throwing the guy out for not following instructions as to which driveway 
got you to the site (he wanted to argue, I ripped up his entry form on the 
spot. He asked who I was, I replied "the chairman". He backed up his car and
got in line line everyone else. I let him show, but he was a pain in the ass
for the rest of the event).

George probably pissed the cop off saying `hello'. 

Anyway, your point is well taken about the chamber of commerce and all. I
call ahead on my tours and make sure that someone from the chamber tells 
the cops to lay off. This has worked fine for the 15 or so tours I have 
put on in 25 years, we have never gotten any participants ticketed (Knock

Have a good one.

The Allison unit I mentioned previously is now sold as a Crane Cams unit. 
I've had real problems with this unit, _due to its confusing the Bosch
L-Jetronic injection computer at high rpm_.  Strangely, it did not confuse
the tach.  It makes a very nice spark, though, so on an MFI car it would
probably work nicely.  I feel the pickup is considerably flimsier than the
Pertronix unit, and of course you have to find a place to mount the
heat-sinked iginition amplifier.  I've never had a failure with either
type.  The Allison/Crane units (they're on the XR700's third major
revision) are around $100, the Pertronix is around $50. 

Chris:

Your mechanic probably tried to install the Allison _with the distributor
in the car_. Don't do this, it's too much hassle.  The Pertronix is
considerably easier to install because:

 1) the mounting pieces are made primarily of metal (nicely/precisely made,
by the way)
 2) it has way fewer parts
 3) it has no parts outside the distributor
 4) there's no need to orient the pickup so that the spark occurs "in sync"
with the rotor aligning with the cap -- this is because the "pickup's"
geometry matches the points exactly, not like the Allison/Crane, which has
to be carefully aligned inside the distributor, which can take some time.
 5) it's half the price

I encountered one problem with the Pertronix - its mounting plate had a
moon-shaped cutout to allow the vacuum advance/retard to function, but it
was too small.  30 seconds with a grinder doubled the size of this cutout,
and all was well.

The Allison/Crane has the fact that it's more "universal" going for it - it
can be had in 4-, 6- and 8-cylinder varieties, and it fits in a wide
variety of makes and models of distributors.

Subject: Need advice on 1979 911


Hi.  I am about to purchase a 1979 Porsche 911 SC w/Whale Tale.  I believe 
that this car was driven in Europe for a few years before it was shipped 
here.  It's equipped with German Instruments and lights.  Manual locks, 
power windows, no air conditioning.  It has 64,000 miles (107,000) 
kilometers.  It is Silver with Black trim.  The current owner is a friend of 
mine who has hardly driven it for the 6 years he has had it.  He will sell 
it to me for $16,500.  It's in great shape.  The paint is almost perfect, 
the interior looks great, and it runs very well.  I am writing because I am 
concerned about the maintenance costs I may face, as I plan on using this as 
an everyday car.  I drive about 1,000 miles per month, half of which are San 
Francisco city traffic.  I will keep it in my garage.  I want to get an 
alarm for it, and a stereo with a CD player.

Should I be concerned?  The only problem that I noticed was that I can 
sometimes smell gas when I sit in it.  Is this normal?  Can anyone estimate 
the average maintenance costs?  I do want to take it to get checked out 
before I buy.  Can anyone recommend someone to look at it in the S.F. Bay 
area for < $100.

He let me borrow it for a day, and I fell in love with it the second I gave 
this woman in my office a ride.  I'm 25 years old, and currently own a 
boring 1992 Eagle Talon, which I am trying to sell now.

Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a bit out of touch with SCCA reg's of late.  However, it has
been my understanding that you may add any available, factory
option so long as you add the whole option.  In the case at hand,
if you were to add some M030 bits, you would have to add all
of them, even those which might seem frivolous or advantageous.
So, struts, control arms, spindles, brakes, bushings, bars, etc.
depending on exactly which M.Y. car you are dealing with.  And
lotsa luck documenting it to anyone who cares -- pack your

Glenn Ingram asked about this a couple of years ago.  I could not find
any official factory recommendations regarding a tensioner update,
only that it's OK to do in their eyes.  Which does not surprise me: if the
factory were to recommend it (versus OK'ing it), they would be exposing
themselves to warranty/service action legal madness.

With respect to the SCCA's exposure to a bazzilion little model-specific
tech nits, keep in mind that they are also keen to keep costs down.  If
they were to allow much more latitude in non-performance mod's, it would
arguably create a situation where people felt they needed to make all
those changes to play in the game, raising the real or perceived cost of
entry.  Yes, zinged valves are more expensive than a Carrera tensioner
kit, but that put the SCCA back on the spot of calibrating exactly how
likely it is for a street race car to lose its chain tension, which is 
basically
impossible.  (I personally have no opinion on this SCCA issue!)

Subject: Gear Oils

In the 15 years or so I was VW/Audi/Porsche mechanic the gear oil issue 
has come up many times. I used to have several factory serive notices 
about gear oil. The key is is most gear oils you buy are TOO 
slippery. Porsche calls for a GL-3 gear oil not GL-5 or Gl-6.  GL-3 can be 
almost impossible to find without special ordering the oil.
This is a case where a upgrade to GL-4,5 or 6 is a problem. The sycro 
rings are desgined to have a given fiction between the inside of the ring 
and hub on the gear. If gear oil is to too slippery the fiction is 
reduced and the shifting can be poor. In addition over time the inside 
of the ring becomes polished and the car will never shift right.
The first shop I worked at was a old and very 
respected air cooled porsche shop and they did and still do only use 
Sweepco. But later I work for another very well respected shop we used a 
special VW/Porsche gear oil made by Kendal. Both gear oils work quite well 
and often fixed the poor shifting caused by used the wrong gear oil. Many 
shops do not want to stock several different grades of gear oil so the 
supplier tells them that this or that multi-grade GL-5/GL-6 will do the 
job for all cars and so people end up with the wrong oil in their 
transmissions. I when I had my own shop it took me months to get the 
right gear lube from my Valvoline supplier but finally after months of 
telling him that I needed a GL-3 only gear lube he "found" the right number 
and ordered me some the correct product in. It too worked quite well with 
never shifting problem on my rebuilds.

The following was received from Monte Smith:

Some clarification is needed after the interesting slant in the report

after three frustrating months of work.  We received very little help from
the Portland Parade Committee (they wouldn't even discuss the issue at their
last meeting) and were snubbed by the track.

As a last ditch effort we contacted the groups who have the track on the 

weekend following Parade and, when we found they might be willing to let
us use those dates, we approached the track people.  They ruled, however,
that they would not allow those groups to give us their dates.  What is 

important is that we never attempted to go around PIR management and that 

they found out about it because we approached them. 


At present, some PCA National Board Members are attempting to convince the
Portland group to let us use PIR for two of the five Parade days; it is
very doubtful that this will happen.  Frustration. Fini.

"Transmission and Differential : Approx 2.72 Imp. Quarts (3.1. liters) SAE90

This does not sound like GL 3 oil. I don't have a can of Swepco in front

If Swepco provides the proper coefficient of friction for the syncros, then

This is less true in some of the less popular classes. I took a 1st
in the Boston Parade autocross, with an absolutely box stock 87 944S,
except for A008-RTU tires (several years out of date DOT approved
road racing tires). I have relatively little autocross experience,
although I do have some SCCA racing experience and a bunch of PCA
drivers education race track experience.  The Parade was the only
time (so far) I have autocrossed the car. My time would have been
well out of the money in the "regular" 944 class, but the 944S
field was light. There were a number of other classes where
non-heroic times won the class, or at least placed well.

Interestingly, my most recent autocross previous to that was the
Portland Parade, where I took 2nd in an essentially stock 914-2.0
(lowered by the "sag" method, but stock springs, sway bars, wheels,
etc., on A008 (not R) tires). I had expected the 914-2 class to be
packed, both with cars prepared to the limit and with experienced
autocrossers, but it didn't turn out that way.

So, I suggest that unless you are in the "I'm not going to run unless
I know I'm going to win" mode, bring whatever you have to the parade
(or other PCA autocross), have a shot at it, and see what happens.

Byron,

As a former 25 year member and Solo II competitor, I will make a 
recommendation that John Kelly and I submitted and explained in the Wheel
ten years ago.

Limit Showroom Stock to five year model participation. 

Makes life simple. Policeing is much easier. Reduces model congestion.
Makes classes easier. It would be even better to limit shocks and tires
and swaybars to those delivered

Crap can Street Prepared or require all cars to be emission legal per
49 states. Suspension is free per existing rules. Any drivetrain mods 
must have either CARB exemption or Fed compliance and be properly 
installed and adjusted and be approved for use by the board.

I quit my membership because SCCA has not been a `Sports Car' club. The 
normal rank-and-file Solo II paricipation has more junk sedans and coupes 
than legitimate sports or GT cars. It has not lived up to its charter in
promoting true sports cars. 
For the average Porsche owner, In we are still being penalized on the 
track as well as in SOLO events, despite how you personally feel. 

I can look back and say that I've won my division, (4 times, different 
classes) so I probably should be happy. But I see many potential 
participants going off mad, on the surface there is no logical explanation 
for the classifications. Some board members have been receptive in the 
past,  few changes have benefitted LEGAL Porsches participating. A few 
A/S 914/4 2.0s are less legal than you believe, it's not just the ride 
height either (Look in the exhaust ports).

Byron, I'm not not directing this as personal thing at you. I am 
generalizing the comments of many PCA members in the San Francisco Bay
Area. There are 175 active PCA autocrossers in Northern California, a
large number of these people would particpate if the Solo Board would
consider that they would add to the quality of the events.

      Ok....I called PPG tech support line (216-572-6111) and they did 
    not have any reference to "Miracle Paint" or "POR-15."  What they
    did say was;
      - Their best paint for durability is "Durathane," which is their 
        polyurethane most competitive with DuPont's Imron. There is
        also a flattener available for this in case its going in 
        an engine bay, etc; use either DX595 or 685. PPG wouldn't 
        go as far as claiming it is immune to battery acids, etc as
        Miracle Paint and POR-15 claim, but (as with Imron) find its usage
        largely on trucks, airplanes, etc. 
    
     - Their best primer is the "DP" line of zinc-oxide epoxy primers, but
       these will not stop oxidation (as Corroless/POR-15/Miracle Paint
       claim). Though PPG recommends DP as a corrosion resistant primer
       over good metal, it does not recommend it over rust ("would be a
       bandaid"). In my own rust experiment (a wrought iron chair in the
       backyard I sandblasted and painted with DP-90) I think the stuff is
       pretty fantastic and doesn't require topcoating. But it doesn't keep
       a consistent gloss (if you want to use to without a topcoat) and is
       usually a little flatter than I'd want. 

       By far, what I felt from PPG was that I was getting responsible 
     answers, and not a sales pitch. But unfortunately I didn't get 
     any validation or invalidation from PPG about the other "miracle"
     products. The fact that PPG didn't even have a pat response -may-
     indicate that the restoration market POR-15/Miracle Paint cater to are
     so small that PPG doesn't even have a sales defense to offer for their
     product (much less make a product that looks/smells like it) and that 
     they are content supporting OEM and body-shops alone. 
       POR-15 is -not- a new product (its 17 years old). Being an engineer
     and living technology, the only things I use or have that old are 
     usually my cars... Of course, I have to be skeptical of tremendous
     claims; I don't believe in 80 mpg carburetors and that sort of thing.
     But even after doing bodywork for 10 years, in the last 5 I've learned
     how little I knew then, and have found "better living thru chemicals"
     and tools time and again. Theres a lot to be said in using something
     you are comfortable with, but it doesn't mean you wouldn't be ecstatic
     with something else...
      So to me, there is nothing to controvert what POR-15 and Miracle
     Paint claim so far...

I have the stock sway bars from my 1989 944 Turbo S for sale. These are
26.8MM in the front and 16MM in the rear. This is the M30 option bars. They
will greatly improve the handling of your 944 series Porsche assuming, of
course, you have smaller bars. 
If you are interested please give me a holler on E mail or home at 610-649-661

I've found that the best way to get that stuff off is a wire brush at 20,000

I put 150km on an '81 Euro SC before selling it this fall. The Euro model
is essentially identical except for the engine and CIS, the doors, the
bumpers, and the marker lights.  A few things:

1) be sure it has the real Euro engine (930/10). 
2) be sure that the seller has originals of the DOT and EPA paperwork,
   in addition to the title. If he doesn't, too bad; find another car.
3) have it fully checked out and smogged at the seller's expense. If
   it doesn't pass, or there is missing equipment, see (2).

> I want to get an

Can't help you with this, but it's just like a US spec 911. I used a 
Viper alarm because it was cheap, and never listened to the radio anyway
so it didn't matter that I had a Sony XR-7180.

> Should I be concerned?  

About the gas smell, yes. Get that checked out ASAP. About owning a Euro
911, not really. *IF* all the paperwork is in order.

> Can anyone estimate 
> the average maintenance costs?  

Your milage will vary. I estimate *MINIMUM* annual maint for a 911 as follows.
You may get lower or higher, depending. I assume professional service at
an independent shop, no do it yourself.

1 major service, $650
4 oil changes, $125 each
3/4 set tires $550 (you'll buy a two sets of rears per set of fronts; you'll
buy a full set every two years, the 3/4 set of tires let's that average out)

total cost: $1325, about $100 a month. 

Other things: if you need shocks/brakes/etc, that's extra. You eventually 
will. As things break, they'll need to be fixed. It's expensive. How expensive
varies with what the part is (some have good sources in the aftermarket,
some are only from Porsche) and whether you can do it yourself or not.

Good luck.

Subject: End of color confusion

Hi,

I'd like to thank Peter Albrecht and John Wright for their help concerning
the correct color (Ivory) of my car as well as the others who answered my fog
light question.  I decided to call Porsche in Reno this week to find out the
truth. Unfortunately, I had asked to speak to someone concerning the
confusion and they transferred me to Owner Relations. I explained my problem
to a Porsche rep and asked if there could be a mistake. He then said "Well,
it is possible that the car was completely stripped and repainted." I
explained further that the paint was definitely original and that their was
no chance that Rose Red  was the original color.  When I again politely
suggested that there was a mistake, he implied that such mistake couldn't be
made, especially if his computer indicated that my car was Rose red. He did
say however that he would leave a note for Howard Adams to look into it.  But
it made me mad that he thought that I was an idiot. His attitude that Porsche
could never make a mistake really needs to be changed. 

Well I called Howard on my own today and told him the situation. He was very
helpful and asked for the paint color and code -Rose Red  4610 - and looked
up the info. Seems as if somebody goofed up he said. There is a rose red but
it is 4510, Ivory according to him is 4610. So as Pete mentioned earlier,
Certificates of Authenticity aren't the last word in Authenticity. People can
make mistakes sometimes when looking up the info. 

As for the fog lights, white means clear lenses as opposed to yellow
Euro-style lights.

Thanks again,

Kevin,

The rule states "as delivered". It was strictly enforced that if the option
wasn't ordered on your car, it wasn't supposed to be there. Differing 
options like sport suspension were in the gray area because, as an example,
a normal 83 944 had no rear sway bar but the mounting brackets were there.
Most people added them with no one the wiser.

Later 944s get sticky. Almost all 944s were equipped with rear bars after 
85 1/2. 924S had front bar standard, rear bar with sport suspension and M030.
In the chart I published with my article and in the little spec books, you 
will see a basic range and years applicable for all factory sizes. It should 
be no problem to legally tune the rear with the combinations available for 
the 944S2, 944 Turbo and 968. It may be difficult in the stock class to
prove your point without the spec book, so buy one.

The killer Street Prepared combo would be a 3.0 944S4 engine in a 83 944
with the S4/Turbo M030 setup. It's legal.

Does someone no off-hand what the size of sway bars are used on the 
plain-jane 1989 944?   Did Porsche upgrade any suspension equipment since 
they increased the displacement from 2.5L to 2.7L?  Any quick reply would be

(Will it be worth anything (in the collector sense) since its the last of

Kevin is pretty much on base with this, but it goes deeper than that. If
you decide to "update"/"backdate" a car with another models suspension or
engine etc. You have to do the whole car, and I mean the WHOLE car. If your
car doesn't have A/C, and all M030 cars did, you would (by the strict
letter of the rules) be required to install A/C. Same goes for any and all
options that would go with such cars. I myself don't know how many of M030
models were built and what options were available with them, but basically,
if you plan to run a car in stock, it has to be as-the-factory-intended-it-
to-be. In stock you can change tires, shocks, front sway bars, brake pads,
and cat back exhaust. There's little things as well, but those are the main
points. That's why I prefer "street prepared" class over stock. 

Just a note on updating your 944, stock classes tend to be the most
competetive as far as nitpicking the rules and protests go. If you don't
intend to be competetive in SCCA, then it might not be as big a deal. If
you start winning a lot (or even a little) people will want to scrutinize
your car. It happens... The chances are, is that you'll be given a warning,
or you may be disqualified. That's generally why people move into SP when
they want to start tweaking and playing with their car.

Good luck with your 944...

>   about it, just about everything turns into a nightmare with this guy so
>   that could be an entirely bogus statement). 

Speaking of installing Allison/Crane optical systems.

I've installed two versions of the Allison/Crane system.

The early one had a slotted aluminum foot that attached to the
detector unit via one long bolt.  

There was little adjustment range in the foot so you had to be careful 
of the mounting hole placement.

The latest one I used (OK, I'll admit it, purchased from J.C.Whitney)
had a two piece bracket to give sufficient adjustment range.

In both cases I fabricated my own one piece bracket after I had determined
a good position for the pickup.

I would NOT try to install one of these systems with the distributor in the
car.

As I remember it, in the early days Allison used to advertise that
it was as easy to install as regular points and gave a low estimated time.
This claim was the subject of a California lawsuit and Allison stopped claiming
this.

If you have a vacuum advance on the distributor, make sure the sensor
leads have a flexible mounting.  The wires can flex and open as the point
plate moves.

It is important to have the distributor rotor pointing to a spark plug
terminal in the cap when the "points" open, otherwise it will arc to 
the cap and destroy it.

I tested this position by taking an old cap and cutting out an inspection
slot under a convenient spark plug wire terminal so I could see exactly
where the rotor was pointing when the points open.  

I hooked up the Allison to a +12V power supply, a car battery would
work fine, and attached it to the sending unit + distributor.


                  +12 V
                ____|________________

                 |                  >  1K resistor
                 |                  <
  distributor    |                  >
     +       ____|_____             |
  pickup---->| Allison |-------------  <-- coil drive lead
             |_________|            Voltmeter

                 V                   V

By rotating the distributor drive shaft by hand (in the direction
of normal distributor rotation), the voltmeter will read +12V when
the spark would normally occur and the rotor will be pointing to where the
spark will jump.  This should point to the exposed inspection terminal.

representative has accomplished much by working through the system in
Ohio - All of Ohio's highways that are legally capable of being 65 mph
ARE 65 mph, and thanks to NMA proactive work through state

non-interstate roads to 65 mph, due to the same proaction. Locally, in
Dayton-Beavercreek, our rep has directly increased speed limits to their
rightful 85th percentile place. Such changes nationally will be a mindset
change that will take place over years, but it has happened rapidly here.

I received my Pano yesterday and was very amused at an expert (Paterek) 
telling someone that VHT paint was the correct paint for a 911/356/914 
factory heat exchanger.
     
This is where the fantasy bullsh*t starts for concours/restoration. The 
Patereks do a fine job for their customers, I like their work.
     
In this case, however, the factory specified a paint that had a high zinc 
content. It is called `cold galvanizing' in the paint trade and can be found 
in the correct gray at many local hardware stores. NOT VHT. While VHT is 
a fine finish, it is not correct.
     
In applying the paint to heat exchangers or mufflers, remove all scale, oil 
and other drippings. Ensure that the surface is as clean as you can get it. 
Paint all outer areas. Allow to dry, it takes a couple of hours. Re-install, 
the heat will turn the dark gray light. 
     
When I last showed my '73 911S, I had just redone the exhaust system this 
way. I had a lot of questions about the `original' finish. All couldn't

Subject: Is 912E VIN #1 (!!!) worth anything?

Hello Porschephiliacs,
	About a month ago I wrote to find info on 912E's and went looking 
for them.  I finally found one, boy did I ever find one.  I was looking 
at the kinda ratty E when I casually noticed the VIN tag. It read 
#912000001 !!! Could it be 912E #1?? I didn't ask the owner, hoping he 
was unwary. Is this #1 and if it is, is it worth fixing up?  It is rusty 
is a few places, needs a clutch (slipping), and though it runs& shifts 
good, the engine puffs blue smoke--scary!  He only wants $6900 for it 
though :^)  Is it worth it, should I jump on it?

When I first read this it did seem a little strange, but I think
it is OK.  The first thing that comes to mind is bending loads
going into the torsion bars, but I think that actually most of
the load is tranferred directly from the spring plate to the
body of the car via the spring plate bushing (what its job is
anyway).  There may be slight bending loads on the spring plate
itself, but we are not really talking about alot of load here -
900lbs maybe?

Subject: Re: Isocyanates (prev 'no subject')

Pfilers,

The various isocyanates found in modern clearcoat-hardener paints can kill
you.  That said, here is what happens and how to combat it.

The isocyanates react with air and moisture to form urethanes.  A similar
component is found in the urethane adhesives found in windshield sealants,
here it is not sprayed and does not get a chance to enter your lungs in any
mist.

Per *ANY* paint manufacturer and OSHA, the *ONLY* respirator permitted is a
'supplied-air' type (and there is a NIOSH number to match).  These are very
expensive.  They are required in commercial operations unless vapor/mist
concentrations can be maintained at sufficiently low levels through good
ventilation.  According to SAF Safety,  Sherwin-Williams and OSHA, an
activated carbon filter solvent prefilter respirator designed and sold for
paint solvents will filter out isocyanates, the problem is knowing when the
filters are no longer effective.  The solvents in automotive paints have an
odor and flavor (they can be smelled and tasted) so the painter can realize a
filter is no longer effective and replace same.  Isocyanates cannot be
smelled or tasted, since this warning is not available, the filter
respirators are not permitted.

According to the technical assistance as Sherwin-Williams and Dupont,
isocyanate toxicity is not necessarily gradual.  Some air-borne pollutants
(such as carbon monoxide) affect the body gradually. A painter might use
isocyanates for 20 years without effect then one day be coughing up blood.
 Another painter may have a reaction the very first time exposed.  According
to the same sources, the 'reaction' may range from finding some blood on a
pillow in the morning to simply 'acute respiratory arrest'.

Many painters choose to disregard the warnings, I know of several that can no
longer visit a paint shop because of a demonstrated sensitivity to the
chemical.  Use this information as you wish, but this is not a toy or a game.
 

On a positive note: the paint manufacturers are all trying to develop and
market an isocyanate-free paint that is safer for users.  Dupont tried one
and already took it off the market.  Sherwin-Williams may have something as
early as this summer.

Subject:       '75 911 w/SC cams.  PCA/SCCA class rules

I have two semi-related questions to submit to the gurus at large:

Whilst looking through an old spiral notebook for a blank piece of
paper, I found the prepurchase notes for my '75 911S.  Seems that
when he had the engine rebuilt, the previous owner had SC cams
installed.  This is my first Porsche, so when I bought it, I didn't
pay much attention to this, and quickly forgot about it.

So, what does this mean for me?  Are SC cams supposed to be a
performance upgrade for the 2.7?  Is this considered a good, bad or 
indifferent idea?  Will I be sorry?

The engine also has the 11 blade fan, Dilavar studs, '73 exhuast
(ie. no thermal reactors), and tensioner blocks (the things that
prevent total collapse--after $8000 in rebuild I guess the previous
owner ran out of $team).

What do these modifications mean for my class placement in PCA and
SCCA?  I'm going to autocross the car as-is, and perhaps with sticky
rubber (I have a spare set of 7" wheels).  At this point in my
career (early), I don't really care what class I end up in--I won't be
competetive for a while anyways (so far I'm neck-n-neck with slow
stock 914's on courses with long straights...).

PCA will take me no matter--I may end up competing against "improved" 
cars, but I'll still get track time.  But what about SCCA?  From what 
I've read here and on the autox.team.net list, I'm not sure if they'll 
let me play in their reindeer games.  Will they throw me out, or just 
put me up against a bunch of fire-breathing trailer-riding supercars?

Thanks

Subject: Subject:  safety (wind) latch on hood


Hello, P-people,

   This my first post.  Unfortunately, it is a little late!  A couple of
weeks ago, I noticed that the safety latch on my hood ('82 911 SC) did
not work, i.e., after releasing the primary latch, you could just open
the hood right up.  I couldn't really tell what wasn't working right,
and the Haynes' Manual didn't have enough detail.  There is a square hole
that the latch goes into, but the latch didn't catch on anything.

   The other day, three things happened: (1) I joined P-phile for the 
express purpose of posing this question to you all, (2) I got to take a
first-hand look at my buddy's '74 911, and (3) the damn hood popped open
at ~45 mph, bending the hinges, rear corners of the hood, and pressing
two dimples into the cowling beneath the windshield.  (Looks like about a 
grand of damage.)  Apparently the primary hood latch has also failed.

  But enough grumbling, my question is this: what should the secondary 
latch grab on to?  The '74 had a piece of metal with a triangular cross
section, but mine did not seemed to have an analogous spot for one.  My
mechanic claims there should be a bar across the sqare hole, but I feel
that there should be a triangular piece (similar to the '74's) tacked on 
somewhere (next to the square hole)?  Can someone take a peek at their's 
and advise?

   Any ideas on the primary latch?  I think that the car cover in the 
luggage compartment was pressing up from the inside, but I know the 
hood was latched down. (I tried to lift it up with my fingers after closing
it.)  My rubber "smile" has the usual buckling due to the usual rust;
could this be interfering with proper closure?


  Thanks in advance.  Sorry this got so long.  (Brevity is the soul of wit?)

Tom,

On the '78 through '89 911's you can do the following:

Front: 8x16 Fuchs (944 Turbo (951) part number with 225/45ZR16 tires.
Rear: 9x16 Fuchs (from 911 Turbo) with 245/45ZR16 tires.

Fuchs are by far and away the best wheels you can put on your '86 911.
8x16 944 Turbo offset Fuchs will cost you around $600 for a pair in
excellent condition. The 9x16 fuchs will cost you about $1200 for the
pair.

The only drawback to this setup is that there are not many tires made in
the 225/45ZR16 size. Dunlop SP 8000s, Pirelli P-Zero, P-700, and Yoko AVS
Intermediate come to mind.

Depending on the particular car, you may want to roll the front fender
lips. My car did not require this until I tried using and 8x15 wheels
with 225/50ZR15 tires for autocross.

The 9x16 setup on the rear is not a problem.

Call Galen Bieker at Werks II (818-845-2530) about this setup. He is in
Burbank and may be able to turn you on to some wheels. Tell him I sent
you.

can "wax out" or "buff out" this very small amount of dust once the paint
has cured? I once had a similiar paint job done to 72 Superbeetle and after
several waxings the dust was a lot less noticable. The paint that was used
in both cases was Dupont "Centuri".

The car was taken apart to be painted, How long should a person wait before
reassembly?

This time of year here in Atlantic Canada can be quite cold so I have the
car in my garage with the heat on to cure the paint, is this a good idea?
How long should I continue heating the car?

About the current thread on Swepco oil;
There seems to be a misconception that Swepco is a synthetic oil. It is my
understanding that it is not synthetic. It is a product that is used, to a
great degree, in the trucking industry and the rigors that exist in that
heavy stress environment where it has proven itself.
I have used it in my 944's for years and it seemed to make them universally
smoother shifters. I also tried Red Line Synthetic once and all hell broke
loose. It sounded like I had no sychros at all. Too slippery it seems. The
folks at Red Line were very nice and sent me some different product that
worked OK but I subsequently changed back to Swepco.
The 944 synchros are a different design that the 915 trans in the 911 series
so I can't speak for the air coolers.

Depends on application. For *STREET* use, the only performance cam worth
installing is the FAT Performance "fuel injection performance cam". I
think that their part number is FJ-440. 

For full-out racing either road racing or autox while using mostly stock
EFI, contact me. That's a different application. 8{)

There are typically three important pieces of paper on a grey market car:

1) DOT. This is a certification from the DOT that the car meets all relevant
   DOT spec for glass, seat belts, door intrusion, 5 mph bumpers, etc.

2) EPA. This certifies that the car meets relevant emissions and has
   all the right parts like a cat, leaded fuel restrictor nozzle, etc.

3) Certificate of Physical Inspection. When the car is titled the first time,
   or often when it is imported if the conversion was done in Europe, the
   state DOT/DMV/Dxx has to certify that the paperwork and the car match
   up.

I also had several other pieces of paper:

a) German service log, title, and registration
b) German bill of sale
c) certification from the shop in Wiessbaden that did the work
   that they had done the work to current US regs
d) translation of the German paperwork
e) certification that the translator was approved to do such technical
   translations
f) shipping paperwork

I could see not having (3) as viable -- the title *should* cover that. Once
you have a clear US title, it can be argued that you never would have
gotten it if that had not existed at some point (sort of like not needing
a marriage license after you're married...).

But (1) and (2) are *CRITICAL*. If you ever get challenged -- like if your 
conversion was done by a fly-by-night place that "converted" you by
just saying "OK, this car is converted" instead of doing the work --
you can be served and required to either make the car compliant, export
it back to Europe, or have it crushed and melted. Unless, of course,
you can prove that the EPA and DOT actually signed off on *THIS CAR*.

As to what they look like, well, they're on regular DOT and EPA letterhead,
and they use that horrible IBM line printer font that other "offical" US
government mass-produced paperwork (like nastygrams from the IRS, etc.)
uses. They have official seals over the signatures, and the titles/office
etc of the signatories, so it can be verified. They're numbered, too.

that except for the ventilation, 911's do just fine in that kind of weather.

Got pretty wet and some of the cars started to act up and finally the road  
started to get blocked with stalled cars and three lanes became 2 and things 
slowed down.... then the 2 lanes became 1 and things really slowed 
down....finally everything stopped. Absolutely nowhere to go.

The water started to rise. The 911 floated around for a while as the water 
continued to rise but then it started to settle and the water level started 
to rise from the floor. As John said, when it was apparent that the level 
was rising up his legs, it was time to abandon ship which he did through 
"the hatch".

Water rose to about the level of the top of the seat cushion. He rescued it 
the next day by which time the water had subsided, but his insurance co

In the 924S, I use this weird gear oil from Shell (German Shell) that the

years back. It was *more* expensive than anything else I've seen, but my
mechanic swore by it, so I bought it.

It did seem to improve things, but that's just an impression.

Talk with your painter and see if he will stand behind you if you 
"color" sand the affected area. You should actually color sand the 
entire car. But this has to be done before the paint cures.

You use 1500 grit wet dry sand paper to color sand. This will take out 
all the imperfections.

I must say, I agree 100%.  You get a gold star from me for the most

GL-5 is a tougher standard than GL-3. GL-5 is intended for higly stressed
hypoid drives and is similar to MIL-L 2105 B; GL-3 is for transmissions with
low to medium loads.
 
The GL rating is an API classification, just like the SH or CD ratings of
motor oil. SH = spark ignition, grade H, CD = compression ignition [diesel],
grade C; an SH/CD oil is better than, say, an SF/CC oil.
 
I use Swepco in my 356s, it works fine.

How annoying.

Well, I have had every car I've owned broken into/attempted at least once,
so I'll offer the following things I've found that work:

1. Don't park the car. <cough>
Okay, so it isn't practical. Try not to park in underground parking lots,
like those in apartments or malls. This is where most cars get broken into,
besides home (at least in Canada - I worked on studying auto theft/damage
patterns a few years ago at work.)

2. Get a flashing LED.
Get a few of them. The flashing light will discourage minor thieving. You
can also get "Porsche Alarm" stickers from the dealer (the ones for 928's
are nice), and put them on various windows. Of course, you can always get a
car alarm, but thieves just look for the flashing red LED's, anyways. (Any
thief not discouraged by an alarm is going to get the car, anyways).

3. Get a dog, and train it properly.
Not many thieves will touch a car with a dog in it, whether it is barking or
not. Mine barked. *Very* loudly (German Shepherd/Collie). It took a bit of
training to get her to bark only when someone was within 15 feet of the car.
(I left the sunroof open and the windows a quarter way down, and always
parked in the shade in the summertime, of course).

At home, my living room window overlooks the driveway (and my neighbours),
and it took even *more* training to get her to bark only when someone walked
up my driveway (the P-car is parked at the back of the driveway - I have no
garage), but not bark when the neighbours came home.

4. (for home) Motion sensor lights.
I don't know about where you are, but here, those kits that take two
spotlights and hook them up to a motion sensor are awfully cheap. Halogen
spotlights don't use much electricity, as well. In my old house, the garage
backed out into an alley, and putting in sensor lights around and inside the
garage chilled things appreciably (the garage door miraculously openned
itself the odd night, though <grin> - but the cars weren't touched.)

I took a greater interest in these things when my insurance company raised
my deductible to $1000 because I was loosing too many radios (I lost three
in one summer in my BMW 2002). I haven't lost one since, although someone
tried the P-car once - while it was parked in a friend's underground
apartment lot.

Hope this helps...

Craig.

Subject: First 912E?

Jay Karolyi writes about a 912E with VIN # 912 000 001. According to my
info, that's not a valid VIN number. The 912E number range is 912 600 0001
through 912 600 2099. (Juergen Barth's Porsche book, known to have
mistakes). Engine numbers from the same source say 406 0001 through
406 2115.
 
Is it worth anything? Who knows? A little bit more, maybe. Check those
numbers again, is the 6 missing? And is the engine number also very low? (It
doesn't need to be the first engine in the series in the first body of the
series; they weren't that religious about staying in sequence.) If
so, it may be that first 912E. But I'm surprised that the very first car
would be in civilian use. The first few of any production run are reserved
for in-house use, testing, press fleets, etc. and I think Porsche has a
policy of putting at least one of everything away in their non-public
storage vault/museum.

Subject: 356 ist kaput!

Dear Philers-

I was greeted with a horrid discovery thursday night...I parked my 356 SC
and returned 10 minutes later and attempted to back up.  The car rolled
about 2 feet then stopped as if it came upon the world's steepest speed
bump.  I checked the parking brake, cycled the clutch petal a few times,
and tried to roll forward.  It went about 2 feet ahead of the starting spot
and met with the same resistence.  I tried this a couple of times more, and
having the same result, I shut her down.  I tried rolling it by hand as
well and she was as stuck as stuck can be.

Any ideas what has afflicted my car.  She's now at the shop, but I'd love
to have some feedback so I can be a little forewared of the extent of the
problem.

Thanks gang,

I just got the Jan/Feb 356 Registry today. On p. 26, under AUTHENTICATION
ALERT, Ron Roland says "But the latest I have heard is that some individuals
have 'created' an exact copy of the Porsche letterhead, down to the metric
paper size, to make their own version of the Certificate and
A-Letter-From-The-Factory; aren't laser printers wonderful? You may not be
able to get original documents from the factory but you can from the
underworld. While I don't wish to rekindle the Kardex Kontroversy, a simple
Xerox copy, at nominal cost, would remove all doubt."
 
My sentiments exactly. However, you could also forge a Kardex copy
relatively easily. To be precise, a Kardex copy, or the Certificate of
Authenticity (they might as well print this on the same stock as used for
"attaboy awards" for all the good it does) is probably only of value to
the person who originally requested it from the factory.

Subject: 924S Options and Suspension

Well,  its done.  I took the plunge and picked up an 87 924S today.  If you
have followed the previous thread on this car  there was talk about the M30
suspension possibly being on this car.  I don't think it does but it has
Front and Rear Sway bars (They look stock but I cant tell).

I don't have a reference book and was wondering if some one could decipher
the options codes on the build sticker.  After all of this discussion of what
is stock and what isn't I am curious to know what was stock on this car as I
want to race it as a *stock* Porsche.

Typ/Type  477  332
Eng Code/Tran Code  07  QK
Paint/Inter  LY7Y/LY7Y  XP
Options :  C02  261 398 423 455
                567  573 651 657

Also there are some idiot things wrong with the electrics and somone might
know an easy fix and I need to buy a new set of tires and I am not sure which
would be right.

1: High beams wont go off.  The switch doesn't seem to want to budge and I am
just curious if there is any way to fix this without taking the steering
column apart.

2:  Windshield wiper return/intermitent setting doesn't work.  Same question
as above.

3: Tires, the car currently has Eagle ST 205/55R15s on it, the tread is
starting to get a little thin and I dont want to trust them when it rains
(Dallas drives are the only drivers I have ever met who were worse than LA
drivers when it rains).  The car currently has the Telphone Dial wheels on it
and the owners manual states some riduclous tire size like 185/75R15 which I
have never seen on any Porsche.  Any strong recomendations for a good street
performance tire that wont lose it in the rain?

Other than some minor problems with the interior and the dead Power Steering
this car has been a lot of fun to drive (Its finaly a Sunny day here in
Dallas on the weekend and what better way to learn about your new car then to
take it for an extended drive?)  
The handling is far superior to the 79 924 I owned previously and that car
had stock front and rear sway bars.

SCCA Solo events take ANY kind of car at any preparation level as long as
it can pass a simple safety inspection.  As you suspected, the cams move
you to F-Prepared, a class which *could* have some pretty wild machinery. 
In all likelihood, however, you'll find little if any, other folks in your
class, and you're more likely to find someone like you, that is basically
a street driver with a cam or other internal engine mod.  In SCCA regions
are allowed to create their own classes in addition to the standard
classes, and many regions have adopted a "Super Street Prepared" class or
something similar, which is for any street legal car built beyond the
rules of Street Prepared.  Whether you wind up in FP or in some regional
class for street cars with internal engine mods, you should be able to
run any wheels/tires you want (including slicks in FP).  And of course,
your primary goals of having a blast and gaining seat time will be met no
matter!

Well, Jim, I could sit on my hands and bite my tongue for a while, but...

I HAVE looked in the exhaust ports of the most competitive 914 2.0 in the
country (in the last two years)--in fact I've seen the motor apart and
been there to help verify that the head CC'd to spec before assembly. 
This car was in impound after winning the CS National Championship in
1993 for 4 days having everything torn down and inspected from shifter to
brake bias (it took the protesting competitors days to find the gauges,
but they insisted on testing the actual pounds in the line) to front
spindle dimensions to full carpet pad existence, to ignition timing to
pedal bushings.  Some gas was even siphoned from the car with the
intention of being mailed to a lab for testing, but the protestor backed
down when he found it was going to cost several hundred dollars.  It's
easy to slander, but I suggest you re-join SCCA, come on out to Topeka or
any Pro Solo or Tour event, plunk down the bucks on these cars you think
are illegal and prepare to find out for yourself.  Prior to that your
sweeping generalities and innuendos are less than appreciated.  I'm sure
there are some illegal cars out there somewhere, but they are usually the
un-competitive ones!

I know and respect John Kelly.  I've been on the same side sometimes and
at times opposite sides of issues with him and always found him to be
well informed and a worthy adversary.  Jim, you'll forgive me if I choose
to credit those statements to you rather than John?  And you'll
understand if I don't form my opinions of the other 175 San Francisco

And Jim, please, don't give advice on SCCA Solo prep legalities (Kevin re:

In response to the dialogue on certification paperwork, there was a document
published in 1984 titled "Handbook of Vehicle Importation, A guide for

 It was published by the "Automobile Importers Compliance Association", 1607

My guess is that since the "Grey Market" dried-up and died, this Association
may no longer be in business.  In line with other warnings, you may remember
the articles in Autoweek and Automotive News  several years ago on faulty
certifications (particularly with some well-know "boutique" sellers in
Southern California) and withdrawal of certifications and title/licenses of
cars performed by those shops cited.  Another concern (which may or may not
be important), is that the wholesale value of many of those cars is way below
those of US spec vehicles.  Many dealers won't touch them at all and the
rough "rule of thumb" by those wholesale buyers who would was 60 percent of

In SCCA the cams will send you directly from Stock to Prepared (the
same class as the 914/6 race car that won FTD at the last 2 Porsche
parades!)

The 7" wheels, exhaust, and fan would be legal in Street Prepared, but
any one of these will take you out of Stock.

Recommendation : as a beginner, just don't mention the cams and
run in Street Prepared. You will be driving an underdog in SP anyway,
so nobody should care.

I agree with David that the PCR's are NG. They allow an unbelievable
amount of modifications in the stock "P" class. This would theoretically
pose a great disadvantage to someone driving a really stock car.
These rules basically allow ANY suspension (sways, torsion bars, 
bushings, 1" wider wheels, etc). It is an absolute FARCE that they have the
circumference rules, which have made me run 225/50/15 tires instead of
the 205's I normally run. This was an AVDANTAGE when I used the 7"
wheels in Lake Placid, but probably hurt me on 6" wheels in Boston.

But from my experience at the Boston and Lake Placid parades, any of
the P classes could have been won by a good driver in a car without
modifications in excess of the SCCA stock rules. Proof is that I won
in Boston when my car was in stock configuration, by 1.5 seconds over
any other stock class. And in Lake Placid, Franklin Wong in his 924S,
bumped himself up a class (just for fun) and still beat all other watercooled
cars (at least he won his class easily). I think Byron in his stock S2 would
beat all watercooled cars at the parades I have been to by a good margin.

So don't be discouraged if your car is stock- get some good tires, drive
your best, and you can win.

Uhhhhhh, what if one didn't have any of this stuff, hypothetically speaking,
of course?  My car, a '76 911, was brought over from Germany in 1985.  The
only "conversion" done was to replace the H4s with sealed beams (I put the
H4s back on), and replace the orange taillight lenses with US red ones.  The
whole rest of the car is Euro spec.  No 5mph bumpers, no smog pumps, no
thermal reactors, etc.

I actually have little fear of retribution.  Maybe ignorance is bliss?

Hi, Jay.
 
Sure. Here it is.
 
 
 
Hello again Porschephiliacs,
        I snuck a look at the car again, its parked in front of a
restarant the guy owns, and I guess I misread the VIN in my glance in
hopes not to catch the owners attention, it is on closer inspection in
fact #9126000001 :^)  With this encouragement I called the guy to ask
about previous owners.  He has owned it for 8 years and he bought it from
the widow (???) of a some guy who worked for Porsche Cars North
America!!! I almost cried to myself.  This widow thing (if he's telling
the truth, but why would he lie?) might explain that no one knows that its
#1 and how it got into civilian hands.  He's been very honest with the
problems on the car & have no reason to doubt him. I offered him $6000
cash under one condition, that I be able to look at the engine before
handing over the cash. He said OK but for $6200 and I agreed. Now, Where
the hell is the number found on the engine?  Its covered in grease & I
can't see a thing, the owner said it hasn't been touched since new.  If the
engine # is within the first few its a done deal! Awaiting your
advice...and facing the fact I'm going to have to let go of my beloved
(and nice) '77 924 to finance the necessary repairs.  Maybe I can keep
both until the 912E totally dies.  Thanx for any info... Jay Karolyi

Subject: Dust in paint

 
Hi, Peter and Julie.
 
Most likely you can rub that right out. I painted a quickie repair to my
daily driver here in cool (60ish; eatcher heart out) and very soggy
California about a week ago. I tried to get cute and blend the paint into
the surrounding old enamel with a final application of very thin Centari
enamel reducer, and got huge runs in the paint. I sanded them right out
yesterday and repainted. This morning, it's cured already, I'll be wet
sanding and polishing and calling this job done. So if your garage is 60ish
degrees and you've waited a week, even the thickest paint should have cured
by now. Especially if your painter used hardener, which I didn't. (Note:
message from another p'philer says you have to do this "before it cures." I
don't know if Centari takes weeks or months to achieve a final cure, but by
cured I mean hardened enough to allow sanding; what you and I would call
"Yep, it's dried.") And yes, use 2000, not 1500. It's gentler and easier to
polish out the sand scratches, and you're less likely to break through the
paint. There are now some even finer grits on the market, imported from
Japan, that might be still better but I haven't tried them. My paint shop
has a display box on the counter with six grits of this stuff, multicolored,
it looks like pastel note paper. Paint shop guy says this stuff is
wonderful.
 
Anyway, the dust. Depending on how big these rocks are, you can probably get
the paint perfectly smooth with the use of a sheet of 2000 grit paper, wet
sanding, using a foam rubber pad available from auto paint suppliers (NOT the
heavy rubber sanding blocks used for woodworking!) 2000 grit is so fine that
it leaves almost a glossy surface. 3M and Meguiar's both make 2000 grit, the
Meguiar's lasts lots longer but you have to buy 20 sheets at a time. Then
you have to polish this out. To give you some idea of how fast the paper is
used up, I wet sanded an entire 356 using 3 sheets of paper. Use lots of
water. If you don't have an electric buffer, you'll have
to do it by hand. For electric buffers, I like Meguiar's Heavy Cut Cleaner,
followed by Meguiar's Swirl Remover and if you like their Glaze. If you don't
want/like/can't find Meguiar's, 3M and DuPont make products every bit as good.
Ask your paint supplier. If you have to do this by hand, there are other
good products out there (Imperial Hand Glaze from 3M?) I have a tube of some
German stuff here, from Glasurit, that cuts quickly but gently; I really
like this for hand polishing small areas or areas that can't be done by
machine (dashboard of one 356 was done in Glasurit and hand polished in the
way I described; 2000 grit and Glasso polish). The Glasso Polishing Compound
is their no. 562-1602 and it is great stuff. I use it by putting a small
amount on a wad of cotton (like cotton balls but bigger). Be careful not to
sand through the paint, of course, but 2000 is so fine that you should not
be able to do that unless you make an effort. Be careful around sharp corners
though, the paint is thinner and the sandpaper cuts much faster there.
 
The Glasso polishing compound and the Meguiar's professional line of
products mentioned have an advantage in not containing silicone. If you do
need to repaint anything, such as if you break through to primer or
(shudder) bare metal, you don't need to worry about silicone ruining the
next layer of paint.
 
There might be one problem with polishing individual areas: you'll like it
so much better than the rest of the surface that you wind up sanding out the
entire paint job. If you go that far, do get an electric buffer (I have a
Hitachi variable speed job, about $150, see Florida International Tool Co.
for best prices) and plan on spending 2-3 days on it. The advantage to this
is that you will get an absolutely smooth, dust-free, run-free,
lemon-peel-free paint job. You probably wouldn't want to pay a painter to do
this on "company time."

I need to find out whether or not it will be necessary to shim the barrels.

Can I use the stock numbers to extrapolate the volume of the combustion camber

new deck height values?  

I'm going to try using this method and let you all know what I come up with.

Friends,

My '87 951 (75,000 miles) recently developed a front vibration when applying
the brakes lightly to moderately. When braking hard, this vibration
disappears. I am not quite sure whether it is a sensation transmitted via the
brake pedal, or felt via the body.

I initially thought of warped brake rotors, but then, wouldn't that continue

Subject: Towing a 914, going to extremes.

Dear P-filers,

Thanks to everybody who offered advice regarding towing a 914 with a Jeep
Grand Cherokee Ltd and U-Haul dolly. Responses were unanimously agreeing that
this combination wasn't going to be a problem. So, last Friday night my
friend and I took off to Lincoln, Nebraska from New Orleans, Louisiana. Going
by the map, it appeared that Route 65 was the way to go. Estimated distance
was about 1100 miles and we (optimistically) calculated driving time @ 18
hours. What I didn't appreciate on the map, however, was that 65 is not even
a divided highway, and leads straight through the Ozark mountains. To make a
long story short, it took us closer to 21 hours before arriving...and that
was with no snow on the roads.
For the return trip we drove from Kansas City to St.Louis and down 55 to New
Orleans. About 100 miles longer but definitely easier, especially with my '73
914 2.0 on tow. The Jeep had no problem pulling at 75 mph, although gas
mileage dropped from 18 mpg to 13 mpg. The dolly is indeed an extremely
stable way of towing a car, and as far as I can judge, no mechanical damage
has occurred.
We slept for 7 hours and managed to be back home at 7 PM on Sunday.
One thing I just found out: whenever a vehicle has wheels on the road,
whether driving or being towed, a VALID REGISTRATION is required in some
states. So I guess I lucked out...

Hi Byron,

Thanks for the recent postings, it's good to hear from the "other side".
I missed the matter that Stan replied back to about SC Communist etc.
I'd like a copy if you would send it to me. By the way, it would be
appreciated if you would copy me, or other intended recipients, of
your postings. Sometimes the list (or AOL) gets screwed up and
I don't see a posting,  or I get it after later ones.

It was before your time, but the SEB really were a bunch of lotus lovers
and Porsche haters. The MAJORITY owned lotuses and the others
wanted to! Look at the classes that have lotuses : they are all LOTUS
SPEC classes. This year it was dumb luck that ASP was won by a 911. Any
decent driver should win in an Elan. The same in A-Stock, thank god there
are no stock elans running. Also in CS, an ELAN+2 would wipe up the
competition. I'd like to get one just to totally screw up the class and get
the lotuses out of stock class once and for all. I don't have to even mention
AP or DM, they are all lotuses.

Anyway, I will work on the chain tensioner proposal. Maybe I can get
something
from PCNA. I'll let you know.

Also, congrats on the S2, could be a KILLER!!!!!!
How did you ever find one with the M030???

There was a Euro version with one-barrel Solexes, but the EP version 
was artifically created to accommodate moving an established technology

Hi, Bart,

Nope, you have warped rotors.  Have them checked for runout and replaced.

Don't waste your time with turning them... They will just warp again.
Put new rotors and new pads on (most people are capable of this) and drive
on in peaceful, vibrationless bliss.

Good luck,

Jim,

Your right, the guy who got pinched in SLO was George McClelland. 

The ticket was not deserved and he had done nothing to provoke the CHP. 

The problems were not with the local police, it was with the CHP. The CHP
officer in question was on a misson. He wanted us to know we were not welcome
in his territory. The same officer pulled this stunt three times.

I was the chase car for the Tour and saw each incident happen. This officer
made several attempts to provoke us by his erratic driving. CB communication
between us helped make each driver aware of what the Officer attempting and
his driving behavior. In seperate instances he gave out three tickets - one
(not George) was deserved. 

I spoke with the local business people in Cambria about this matter.
Basically, I needed to know if this action by the CHP was an anomaly or
business as usual. They informed me this action was normal and the attitude
of the officer was the prevailing attitude in the CHP division. The local
business are well aware of the problem and have also been targeted by the CHP
in the area, if they have a SportCar. One person told me that a CHP Officer
told him that he would make it impossible for him to keep his Porsche. After
numerous C-S**t tickets, he finally sold the car. Guess what? No more
tickets!

Impressed to hear that you are so well prepared for your trips and go to
places the local business can tell the Police what to do. That does not work
in most places.

For the record, we have not had any problems in the 22 years George
McClelland has lead this tour. 

As far as writing a letter to the local Chamber of Commerce, it has been
discussed. I am not sure this will have any impact. If the prevailing
attitude of the CHP in this area is to let Sports Car owners know they are
unwelcome. The Chamber has no control over the CHP - it is a State Agency. 

If you have an issue with any Orange Coast Region member, you can let me know
by E-Mailing me directly. I do not think it is appropriate to discredit an
individual in this forum because you have had a misunderstanding with them.
 If you need George's E-Mail address I can provide it.

Subject: Gearbox oils

First a caveat.  I deal with this on a theory basis.

The demands upon a gear oil are very interesting.  It isn't very
surprising that different oils give different optimizations.  Modern
hypoid differentials have a lot of sliding which must be lubricated.
Some of the oils which preserve these gears are highly corrosive,
but build up slippery resultant surface coatings.  This is no problem
if the differential is separate from the gearbox (!-).

The gears and bearings simply want good slippery lubrication with
enough film strength to keep metal parts from rubbing.  This is
another compromise element, not necessarily matched to the one above.

The synchronizers need to have viscosity and friction properties that
allow them to engage (non-lubricant behavior) and then free again
before going into gear.  They don't want high wear, so lubricant
properties are really needed.

This all is approached with a variety of mechanisms, materials, and
lubricants.  A single number on a gearbox oil will probably be
insufficient to describe the needed properties.  Those gearboxes that
combine differential and gearbox with the same oil will need different
materials than those which separate them.

On a couple of occasions you voiced your preference for the '86 Carrera among

915 vs G-50 transmissions, and I believe we agreed to disagree on that one...

Nope. It's the 915 vs. G50 thing that drives me. '86 is the earliest year
Carrera to get if you're getting a Carrera, at least as I see it. From
my perspective, you get a Carrera or newer if you're looking for a "civilized"
Porsche, something that you can drive daily without giving up too many of
the creature comforts you'd have in say a Maxima or similar. So, the '86
has the "fixed" A/C which has bigger vents and integration with the
heater, they typically have luxo features like most are in full leather, and
most have sunroofs and all have electric windows and typically door
locks. In '87 they kept all that but added the G-50. From the perspective
of meeting the target I describe, you can't go wrong with a later car,
right on up to the last of the C2s just before the 993 (which I put in 
a completely different category, BTW).

I however am driving a 30+ year old car, and immediately prior had a 
Euro 911 that was as bare bones as I could find. I'm looking for performance,
and don't want things getting in my way. Like not being able to find
7:31 ring and pinion for the G50. Like the extra weight from all the
luxo stuff. Like that extra 2" of headroom I need so badly that the
blasted sunroof eats. So I want the latest car that I can find that doesn't
bring too much extra baggage with it.

So my ideal compromise car would be a '86 factory turbo look cab. Something
I can tweek slightly and be *VERY* happy with, but comfortable enough
that my wife won't roll her eyes and sigh. However, the compromise winds
seem to be blowing into a different pattern of late: a tow vehicle and
dedicated competition car, with a 356 or 3 for daily driver and fun...

ARE exempt, but everything later must be tested every 2 years. And it's even
worse- starting in 1996 (but soon to be postponed until 1997, after the '96
elections) is the Dreaded IM240 test- a 6 minute DYNO test that will take at
least a half-hour to perform and lead to long lines and ping-ponging back to
your mechanic and back to the smog test and back to your mechanic 'cause the
testers can't do any adjustments and the adjusters can't do the testing! And
the cost limit will be $450, but suppose you need  two jobs costing $400
each- you gotta do BOTH and suppose you need a $1500 valve job to pass the
test, you gotta do it. And suppose you need THREE $300 jobs, you gotta do 2
 but not the third, but you get only a ONE-time exemption  so the next time
you're out of luck.
     The Maestro predicts that once this IM240 disasater hits Joe Sixpack,
there's gonna be another American Revolution. (Too bad it'll have to wait
till the year 2000 elections to make itself felt, but  it will.
    It the meantime, ALL 356's are EXEMPT FOR ALL THE CA SMOG TESTS- FOREVER!
(Well, that's what the Smog Boys claim in their "Smog Reporter" sent to all
Licensed Shops, of which the Maestro is one.)

    All the more reason to:
KEEP THE 356 FAITH!!!

Subject: re: paint and sandpaper



Peter A. recently mentioned a Japanese sandpaper that is newly available
for polishing paint. I brought some of that paper back from Japan, and it
is truly amazing. The grit scale is from 400 to 1200, based on a system
that is 1/4 the system we use (i.e. 1200=4800 our system). The back of
this sheet is rougher than the abrasive! It seems to be made of a plastic
sheet, which is very durable. I have used it for polishing rocker shafts
and arms on 356 motors to a mirror-like finish. I haven't tried it on
paint yet, but I suspect the results would be great if you had the
patience. If anyone is interested, the stuff is called "Rub-lap" and it is
made by Kovax (Komatsubara Abrasive Co.). I don't know where you can get
it here, though.

towing?  Where can I find a tow bar and necessary hardware?  Can I use a U

Re: 993 suspension adjustments

Here's the deal: The 993 front suspension is adjustable, I'm
told, in the usual way. You can raise or lower the collar around
the shock tower. The rear is different. You can fine-tune the
ride height via three shims that Porsche makes: 3 mm, 5 mm,
and 8 mm. If your friend really wants Euro ride height (about
1-in. lower than U.S.), tell him to get Porsche lowering springs
matched to his suspension (normal or sport). I'm running H&R
springs that take the car down 1-1 1/2/-in. and have no problems.
The car rides about as low as my old 944T did, which means I
have to be careful at driveway dips. Hope this helps...

Back in 1987 I put a Balupunkt Lexington with some honeycomb 3.5" into my 1982 Mercury Capri and it sounded 
great.  More importantly, I appreciated the clean design of the unit - simple layout of the controls, clean sound, and 
problem-free operation.  It's been a long time since I've shopped for car audio, but my opinion back then was that the 
Japanese head units had too many features on too few controls - and too many tiny buttons.  They certainly did not look 
as solid as the Blaupunkts at the time.

However, I will say this - a friend of mine has a Sony CD head unit with detachable face.  A real nice unit available at a 
decent price from Crutchfield's or some similar place.

Well, the rules in Canada are pretty much the same as in the states - the 
trailer has to be plated and insured, no radar detectors, and Southern 
Ontario has photo radar now - hmmm. ok, so they're a bit different.

I'm pretty sure you need trailer brakes as well.

The main problem people seem to have bringing cars into Canada for 
events is confused student customs officers. Their guidelines seem to 
change every year <sigh>. A good idea would be to call ahead to the 
border, or to convoy with some others. At our region's weekends, it seems 
the first couple of 'marecans crossing the border gets a raised eyebrow, 
but if a half-dozen Porsches on trailers show up at once, well...

We used to give out information on getting thru customs, but we were 
wrong more often than right. In general, though, make sure you have some 
kind of official paper saying you own the car, and impress on the customs 
person that the car is *not* staying in Canada - it is going back home 
the same way (and hopefully the same condition :) it came in. Their 
primary concerns are making sure the vehicle is in the hands of its 
rightful owner, and that duty is paid if the car is staying in Canada.

btw, Rennsport region's calendar of driver's education events (blatant 
advert here) will be posted at the Web site below later this week. It was 
supposed to be last week, but our executive meeting got cancelled due to 
continuous freezing rain.... <sigh>

New feature this year, though - at our Mont-Tremblant events (at least the
first one), we'll be running an autocross (a *fun* autocross) on the
skidpad at the same time. It should stretch our organizational abilities 
to the limit, but we're looking for new challenges, now that we've 
mastered the four-lane, no-waiting, chinese-fire-drill, morning tech 
inspection... :)

I've been following the thread on PCA/SCCA rules and regulations.  Interesting.

My '87 911 has had the ever popular cracking/failure of the rear sway bar
mounts.  To remedy this, I have welded up the mounts with an additional
piece of metal across the open side, effectively turning the C-shaped bracket
into a box channel.  This is intended to reinforce the piece and redistribute
the bending stresses to prevent future failure.

So, does this modification of a "suspension related" nature eliminate me from
legally competing in the PCA-P15 and SCCA-AS stock categories?

I agree, the CA smog-test situation is becoming totally ridiculous, and I
hope it will backfire on CARB big-time.  Since you have access to CARB's
commandments, can you enlighten me/us on the following question:

Will the IM240 test apply to those model-year cars that currently only have
to pass _at idle_ (e.g. up to '77 or so)?

These cars get _tested_ at higher rpm, but they don't have to pass.  And if
the test applies to these idle-pass cars, what on earth is the logic behind
this enlightened thinking?

Thanks

>>I'd appreciate any details, and any opinions from the rest of the forum.

>>Yoram Guy, Ann Arbor, MI
>>...Still Looking for an '87 Carrera Coupe...

Guy,

I have opinions on 87 Carrera's. I had one, my wife had one, I have a friend who
still has one. I had only one gripe about the car, which caused me to sell it.
I put 52,000 mile on mine. Replaced the head temperature sender 3 times. My
wifes car has a lot less milage on it, we replaced the head temperature sender
only once. My friends car has even less milage on it, he has replaced the head
temperature sender twice so far.

My wifes car we also sold, but it had other problems that I attribute to it and
not to 87's in general.

I don't know if the head temperature sender is a problem with other than 87's,
but believe the above is enough evidence that it is a problem with 87's.

The head temperature sender problem was so annoying for me for two reasons.

 1-When it goes out, the car is dead. It does give you plenty of warning, but
when it goes, the car won't start. Well... it will start after it cools off, but
it will quit again as soon as it warms up. Not long enough to drive anywhere.
The warning signs are the engine starts cutting out. Like one or two cylinders
don't fire. This happened to me so much in the 911 that my heart still skips
when my 914 does it, but its never gone dead on me.

 2-The dealer (3 of them) will adamantly deny that the head temperature sender
can be the problem, insisting that it has to be something else. The local dealer
kept the car for three days, said there was nothing wrong with it, and refused
to replace the head temperature sender. This was the forth failure I personally
experienced, so I had become very familiar with the symptoms.

When I was atuoxing my 73 2.0 I flat towed it all over northern calif. 
This was easy and didn't cause any damage. For the tow bar I used did 
have to cut holes in the front trunk floor pan. I also had to hook into 
the light system to have brake and turn lights work on the 914.

You do have to disconnect the battery and LEAVE THE KEY ON SO THE CAR 
WILL STEER.  Also you can never back up.

BTW I still have the tow bar if you are interested. Since I have not

Subject: 944 steering failure

Item Subject: Text_1
     This weekend I diagnosed and fixed the reason for the sloshy steering 
     on my 85.5 944.  Of the four bolts holding the steering rack to the 
     chassis member, two had sheared off.  They were the two on the 
     driver's side (of course).  The rack was just sliding in the mount on 
     the passenger side.  360 degrees of steering play makes for a tiring 
     ride!  
     
     These bolts are M10 8.8 bolts.  I suspect the top bolt failed first, 
     then the rack came out of its proper location and the second bolt 
     failed after about two weeks.  Has anyone had similar problems?  I 
     replaced the failed bolts with similar 8.8 bolts.  Is there a 10.8 or 
     other useful strength I should use?  There didn't appear to be any 
     other damage.

This hasn't come up for a while, but one of the considerations (no matter
how remote it might seem to you NOW) is that if you ever do compete in
Autocross in PCA or SCCA the fact alone that your car is a EURO will throw
you into higher classes.  Both rule sets are based on "available and
delivered through U.S. dealerships" (or similar wording) vehicles in the
more stock classes.  I've seen a couple of folks get screwed on this
technicality after they casually attend an autocross and then get hooked --
then they find their Euro car is totally non-competitive in the "MOD"
classes in which it gets placed.

Subject: Re: towing 914

    Dear Thak,
    
    Below is a description of an expensive ($600) flat tow-bar rig  that 
    requires no cutting to install.  Flat towing is easy, as long as you...
    
        1)  Unhook the battery
        2)  Turn the ignition key past the steering wheel lock.
        3)  Don't back up (more than a foot or two)
    
    If you are flat towing correctly, the wheels (and hence the steering 
    wheel) turn in the same direction as the tow vehicle.  It is kind of 
    wierd to look in the rear view mirror and see the pilotless 914 
    steering wheel turning as you turn.
    
    The very nice tow bar...
    
    The tow bar is 5 separate pieces.  4 of the pieces attach to the car, 
    the 5th piece is the tow bar.  Two of the four pieces attach to outside 
    the vehicle body behind the front bumber.  They have tabs that extend 
    out the fog light opening for attachment to the towbar.  The other two 
    pieces attach inside the vehicle body.  These inside pieces extend from 
    the mounting bolts of the towbar tabs to the rails running through the 
    spare tire compartment. They transfer the pulling load from the 
    perpendicular front body sheet metal to the longitudal front rails.
    
    Installation is about 2-3 hours.  Topper Chasse currently manufactures 
    all the pieces and does an excellent job.  Very heavy duty with top 
    grade hardware.  He can be reached at his office at 818 845 2530.  
    Expect to pay about $600 incl tax.  Pretty steep, but when you consider 
    the advantages of flat towing (reduced weight to pull, no 
    loading/unloading), it starts to become worth it.
    
    
    Thanks,
    Jon

The can of paint I have is called, "Cold Galvanizing" I will get the

I purchased my spray can from Orchard Supply Hardware, a chain in California
that has carried the product for 20 years.

I find that a coating lasts for about two years, I have very little scale
and exterior rust. Oil droppings, unfortunately, do stain it, much the same
as the original factory paint. 

FYI, 1974 and later 911s have stainless composition mufflers. They were
not coated with any paint.

1973 and earlier 911s, all 914s, 1976-77 924, 912, 912E and some 928s had 
gray finish paint on the exhaust systems. The remainder had stainless or a 
black finish (944) on the exhaust systems.

Sorry for any confusion. You are correct about varying qualities of paints,
I will get the manufacturer of the one I use.

Subject: Re: 993 ride height

Pete(s),

I checked some factory 993 lit. I have.  The std. 993 is listed at a height
of 1300mm.  The "sport" version is listed as being 10mm lower in the front
and 20mm lower in the rear.  
Don't know exactly how that would work out on the height.  The "lower" is
effected with shorter springs with different spring rates on the sport
version, according to the lit.

The (new) Euro. RS/ RS Clubsport is listed with a height of 1265mm.

I could find no reference for the std 993 Euro versus std 993 US being
different from each other.

Post the Chamber of Commerce's address.  I'll write 'em a letter!
- ----------------

Before we go sending boycotting hate mail to the Chamber of Commerce,
perhaps we should take a minute to evaluate the situation more
thoroughly.

What we know so far:

1. Porschephile allegedly unjust ticket.

A member of Porschephiles got a ticket to the tune of, what was it,
$179? for going 50 in a 55. He sent in the ticket with a check and
a letter of protest, only to get slapped with an additional $100
fine.

2. Testimony that ticketed Porschephile tends to be a jerk.

Another member of Porshcephiles claims that abovementioned ticket
victim is something of a jerk, and gives examples of inappropriate
behavior at some concours Parade event or other.


What we don't know for sure yet, and ought to find out before we
start boycotting a whole community:

1. What violations were REALLY being committed? 

My only official moving violation in 11 years of driving was for
doing 65 in a 55. What the ticket didn't say was that I was actually
doing 80 in a trashy Datsun with one brake light out, which the cop
was nice enough to omit from the report (I was a pennyless student
in a hurry). Perhaps our persecuted Porschephile was going 
50 in a 55 BACKWARDS, or with plastic wrap on his tires (see
Testimony above)? Did he moon the cop as he was approaching the
vehicle?

2. What exactly did the ticket victim's letter of protest say?

Did it say "Here's your f***ing money, you ***holes. Why don't
you stick it up your..." etc. ?

3. What exactly did the response with additional $100 fine say?

We should give the county a chance to tell their side of the
story.


Don't get me wrong, I'm all for organizing against unjust tickets
doled out to people just because they drive Porsches. I drive
one myself (when it's running - no tickets yet), and if we can
determine that the county really did mistreat our ticketed Porsche-
phile, then I'll vollunteer to be the first to write them a letter.

What I want to avoid here is a big reactionary movement to boycott
an entire county that is centered around an event that just might
be a cop dropping indecent exposure and reckless driving charges
against the kind of ***hole that give the rest of us Porsche drivers
a bad reputation, and instead being nice with an easier 50 in a 55
offense.

Let's try to treat the county as justly as we expect to be treated.
They should get exactly what they deserve.

Ouch! Sounds like a problem I had with my BMW. Replaced the idle valve 4 times
the first year I had it. And it was *NEW*! Abused the warranty that year!


Like Yoram. I too am looking for a late model 911, either an '88, '89 Cab
or a '90 coupe ('90 Cab is too many bucks!). I've read that there were
some problems with the '90 C2's - problems that could be quite costly. I
don't quite remember the details, but it seems like they were related to
head gaskets. I was going to ask some philes with '90 C2's if they had 
experienced any significant problems, but guess what? No one on the list
has a '90 C2!  Hmmm...  Coincidence or silent warning?


Any thoughts on Carreras vs. early C2's ?

The latest alignment so far is the best (at least the car isn't pulling
to the right any more) but it's not perfect.  Is it impossible to align
a 928S so that the it drives perfectly straight?

The dealer gave me a computer printout of the results of the latest

Judging by these figures, (and I'm not sure what ALL of them mean) is
this an acceptable alignment?  Also the mechanic told me because my car
rides a bit lower than normal for a 928, it's harder to keep it aligned.
Is this true?

Subject: !#&$%*#@# Mechanics...Stripped 911 Tranny Plug..Help


Well, I managed to get a gallon of Swepco (for a case of beer,
no less!). Put the car up on jackstands, and went underneath
with my new 17mm hex wrench. The filler plug cam out with a
"snap" sound, and unscrewed fine, but it was obviously tightened
too much. The drain plug was a different matter...it has obviously
been abused, and the 17mm socket was more like 19mm at the top of
the socket, and 17 at the bottom. The sides of the plug were
rounded inside. I inserted the hex wrench, and carefully applied
torque. No go, and the insides of the plug started to round out
even more. I became apparent that the torque on this plug was more
than the 18ft-lbs that is required.

I have now managed to "round" out the insides of the plug, and am
stuck. So, any ideas? I can:

1) Try the hammer and chisel approach, and try to get enough material to
   drive the plug to unscrew it.

2) Drill out and use an easy-out. Does anyone know how big this plug is?
   It seems to be really soft, so it could be aluminum.

3) Pipe wrench on the theads that are sticking out of the tranny case.

I have ordered a new plug from the dealer, and have put out a contract on
the mechanic who last changed the tranny oil. I know I have at least 70ftlbs
before the socket stripped out.

Any suggestions?

Subject: 74 Carrera

I am going to be looking at a 74 911 Carrera on Wednesday. This particular
car has too many miles (280K) for me to be really serious about purchasing it,
but I thought it would be a good starting point for this year and model. At
least to see one extreme of the spectrum.

I know that the 2.7 engines had stud pulling problems, so Timeserting with
Dilivar or RaceTec studs are a must. This is the year before the thermal
reactors and the rest of the smog junk, so it seems a good compromise
for my purposes (daily driving, drivers ed, and autocross). Many folks
have replaced the engines of early cars with 3.0 or 3.2 liter motors,
but I don't want to get into that sort of modification just yet. And I don't
intend to build a mondo racer 'cause I just don't (yet?) have the driving
skill. I do want a car that will be fun to drive and good for developing
my meager skills with. I do like the earlier cars being that they are
leaner and lighter. I especially like the looks of the Carrera body
accents (flares, air dam, spoiler). If I could afford it (and/or the
market for these cars weren't so hopelessly inflated), I'd get a
'73 Carrera RS. I do know that the '74, while looking similar and
having a similar name, is not the same car: no lightening and
less HP. Other cars I am considering are a '72 or '73 S.

For those who may be wondering, I am now looking for a 911
rather than a late model 944S2. I have recently driven several
911's. There is something about the growl from behind and the
vibration in the seat of your pants that is hard to explain. Besides,
they hold their value *much* better than a 944. If I could afford
both, I would have a 944 for commuting and a 911 for the weekend,
but...

So, other than rust, are there any other things that one should look
out for or be aware/wary of in the '74 Carrera?

TIA,

My car (an 87 911) also has a leak that seems to have become more noticeable
since I put the car away for winter about a month ago.  During the summer
I noticed a couple of drips, but over the past weeks I seem to have
loast 1/4 of a quart or so.  If this is a problem, I too, would be grateful 
to hear.

Also, what seems weird (at least to me) is that the oil seems to be hitting 
the piece of cardboard (cheaper than an oil pan and I had a big piece lying
around) in the middle and just inside each wheel.  Now it doesn't seem 
too surprising just inside the right wheel because this is aprrox where the
oil filler hole is, but I am not sure I follow why inside both wheels there
seems to be a leak.

I should probably crawl under and check that it is not brake fluid.  I bled
the brakes before parking up for the winter.  I hope I didn't forget to
tighten the bleed nipples.

PS what kind of oil did you use when you switched to Mobil 1.  I used to use
Valvoline 10W30, but switched to 10W40 this summer.  I then started hearing
bad things about 10W40.  People have told me that the viscosity enhancers
means it breaks down more raidly and that 10W30 is better.  It started me
worrying about using the 10W50 so I would be interested to hear what you
used.

The lever clips onto the high/low switch within the column.  Could be 
it just popped off, or maybe the plastic locking tab broke.  Either

Re the '90 C2, Bruce Anderson did a summary which is posted on Compuserve as

 <There were a couple of problems with these early C2/4 models that can be 
an expensive nascence there were a lot of failures with the original dual 
mass fly wheel and there was a problem with the cylinder heads leaking. Both 
of these problems were fixed in 1991/92 and Porsche has been pretty good

First check the front wheel bearing for play. If none exists then you have

Don't bother having them turned. Blanchard grinding is the only acceptable

Subject: Rules Schmoolz -- Just pick one!

There's a lot of threads here about the various rulesets we have to choose from.
Tell you what I think:  We're really lucky to have three, count 'em, three
available rulesets which fit the average Porsche owner's idea of "stock".  To be
100% as competitive as you can be, of course, you have to pick a venue!  If
you're willing to settle for 80% you can build for two rulesets at the same
time.  If you've already built the car it would be merely a coincidence if it
happened to exactly match the hot setup for any ruleset.

The current progression, from most stock, to most wild is:
	SCCA Stock  -->  PCA Stock  --> SCCA Street Prepared.
It's not a natural progression, however as some SCCA Stock items could be
illegal in PCA Stock, and some PCA items could be illegal in SP.  (SCCA Stock
does, of course, progress naturally to SP.)  

To try to make sense of any ruleset, assume it came together through the
"dartboard" method.  In this method, the votes of the governing body are taken
by throwing darts while blindfolded at a spinning dartboard lined alternately
with the words "NO" and "YES".  Once you assume this, you are left with no
politics, no "fairness" issues, just a set of rules.  Some rules we like.  Some
we hate.  Some help my car.  Some don't.  But they still are the rules.   

I would try to determine which set (of the three available) seemed to most
closely match what I want to do to my car, then I would build to that ruleset.
If my goal was just a monthly speed fix, I'd build accordingly.  If my goal was
a national championship, well, that's different--more costly and not necessarily
more fun either.

Since joining the SCCA's SEB I've found that I know less and less.
Particularly, I can't really know anymore what constitutes "fairness".  Every
time I think I've hit on one tiny little morsel of the stuff, some driver comes
along who's better than we thought, or who figures out a new interpretation, and
suddenly "fairness" isn't so concrete.  "Gray areas" sometimes expand to the
point that black and white seem like distant points on opposite horizons.
Still, I think, we progress towards a better ruleset, often times, despite
ourselves.  From what I know of the PCA ruleset (which admittedly isn't much) it
seems to me they have done a very nice job of meeting their member's needs.  I'm
jealous that they get to work within one marque which seems easier to me; but
then that feeling would probably evaporate if I sat on their board.

Hey, explore your options!  I suppose the perfect ruleset is one which allows
exactly what you've done to your car and no more, and classes you against 30
other competitors just like you! (Or 30 half-blind guys in Yugos, depending on
your point of view ;^) !)  Barring that, just build it so you can have fun!

Now if you wouldn't all mind, kindly forget that I'm one of those damned,
sh*t-for-brains, could say as dumb as a babboon, but the babboons would be
insulted, rules guys so we can talk Porsches!

Subject: Re: SCCA SEB and chain tensioners

>Loti.

The biggest problem is making one stock legal and proving it.  I'm not
sure how they'd do in legal trim; probably no real threat of seeing one
this way, especially after all the hoops old Porsches have been made to
jump through.  Steve (Compton) and I have often said that you could pass
100 street-driven 914's in front of us and unless they've been
conscienscously built to SCCA rules, we could throw out 99.  Heck just
pull the distributor cap and look for the rev-limiting rotor--that'll
eliminate 90 or more!  The cars just don't exist in SCCA legal trim until
they've been put that way--and that ain't cheap!  I bet the problem with a
Lotus is even more humongou$.

>Chain tensioners.

Someone said earlier that Porsche would never have issued a recall, as
that would have put them at risk of lots of law suits.  I totally
disagree.  914's had the recall for the sub-standard fuel lines (which are
therefore legal in SCCA), and that problem could be far more catastrophic
to the driver, and therefore litigation-wise.  Getting PCNA to say that
they "accept" the tensioners probably won't sway the SEB since Porsche
will gladly "accept" 2" wider wheels, stiffer springs, and more.  Let's
face it, Porsche will "accept" anything that makes the cars go faster;
that doesn't mean it's a recall item, or even a recommendation.  So first
choice is a recall or other similar "factory directive".  Second is a
factory "recommendation" for non-competition use.  Barring these two,
we're better to go without Porsche documentation and appeal to common
sense (yeah, I know, using the words "SEB" and "common sense" in the same
sentence is a misdemeanor in some states).  ;^)

Regarding our chances:  with a factory recall or mandatory directive, near
90%!  With a factory recommendation probably 30-40%.  With neither,
probably less than 10%.  That's either great news or horrible news
depending on what the factory says. . .but then I had previously said it
would be a cold day in Hades before we could get ride-height adjusted
914's to stay in CS.  Like I said previously, I'd really like to see the
discussion rather than just accepting it "because that's how it's always
been done."

>S2.  How did you ever find one with the M030???

Pure blind dumb luck!  I put out the word on Compuserve and the second
response was a "vapor car" supposedly coming in off of a lease prior to
actual lease end.  Since my background is in the car business I know that
this is a very tricky deal, to break a lease early, so I didn't have a lot
of desire to jump through all those hoops.  That is, until the dealer
offered to read me the original window sticker, which as paid options ONLY
listed the Limited Slip and the Sport Chassis.  Very calmly I had him go
out and check the build codes behind the rear carpet.  "030".  Suffice it
to say I became *much* more interested!!  With some patience (not my best
quality) the hoops were finally cleared and I struck the deal over the
phone.

I'm the second owner.  All service records are there.  Oil changes every
2500 miles, even while on vacation in Florida.  The car has only minor
paint chipping in the lower rockers behind the wheels.  Everything else is
perfect.  56K miles.  This weekend we screwed down the perches and
adjusted the rear spring strut, dropping the car around 1.5" all around. 
Laying under the car it's clear that we found a truly exceptional vehicle.
The only difficulties were breaking bolts loose--obviously the first owner
never tinkered with ANYTHING.  All the part #'s are correct, the paint
dots on the springs are right, it's like he knew he was just breaking it
in for me!

We'll race it for the first time this weekend, then once more before we
drag it out to Jacksonville for the season opener.  All the car needs now
is a bunch of white checkers on the nose!!  :-)

At least there WAS a 6v Allison system that fit on the 356.

In the Automotion catalog (copyright 1992) page 119,

   "356 6-volt    XR-700     $159.95"

It is NOT listed in the latest Automotion catalog.

In the Allison 1989 Master Catalog,

    Allison lists this part number: 

       700-6231 is for use in the 4 cylinder - Porsche 356 6 Volt system.

The 1989 phone number for Allison is 818-303-3621

Subject: 914 rebuild

Folks,

I remember a conversation I had on the phone one evening with a guy from FAT
Performance.  I memory serves, he told me that with the NPR 96mm kits that I 
should not install the metal gaskets on the shoulders of the heads.   I take
this to mean that the bigger sleeves are somehow self-sealing.  

I've tried the installation with and without.  With the gaskets there is a 
noticeable 'gap' at the top of the cylinder, but without them the cylinders
fit snugly with the combustion chambers.  I also noticed that without the 
gaskets the test install left small marks from the snug fit on the tops of
the cylinders.  Am I correct in leaving the gaskets off?

By the way, rough calculation of deck height vs combustion chamber volume 
shows that I'm somewhere between 8.2 and 8.8:1 for a compression ratio which
is fine as far as I'm concerned.

Thanks,

Curious and curiouser.....  If yours was a special edition I am going to have

purchased of a dealer lot in 91 with only 619 miles on the clock and there
is a registration sticker stating NOTE:  Actual Mileage.  Since then
someone has put 94K on the car with regular maintenance but no large
services.  That and the really stupid tire size, My speedo reads 90 in normal
traffic around here with these 205-50, I cant tell what speed I am really
going. ( Probaly to fast..)

I would appreciate your input on how best to set this up for daily driving/
first autocross car.  My old boss was a p-phile and she gave the bug to try
try and try.  I dont want to spend lots of $$$$ until  I learn my ability so
I figure this is a good car to start on.


I would love to here anybody else's input on this and I have a wonderful

be standing next to me when I caught my Porsche bug a couple of years ago and
now he has come down with it.  He has decided that he really likes the 928
for his needs but neither of us know much of anything about them as far as
what to look for in a potential car.  Any comments or suggestions?  He has a
limited budget 6-10k to start and he understands to expect a high maintence
cost.

Josh,

As far as I know the special edition 924S' were built in 88.  There were about
500 of them made and they had:
  mechanically
	heavier front sway bars
	adjustable front spring perches
	Koni adjustable shocks
	rear aluminum control arms
	15x7 wheels in rear
	no rear wiper
	manual windows
  aesthetically
	black exterior
	grey with maroon pin stripe interior
	maroon carpet
	
I will get the option code for this car and post it tomorrow.

Subject: Higher flight level for 69-912

Fellow Porschephiles,

Since relocating to New Mexico (5000' altitude and much higher) I've been 
looking for ways to restore the performance lost since leaving sea level.
The rebuilt engine has a slightly larger displacement (1750cc) with Weber 
40ID carbs. I've recently tried installing a crane multi spark system, but 
ran into problems fitting a Pertronix magnetic ignition system.

The Pertonrix unit will not fit period. The tolerance in within 2mm so
I wonder if I should send it back or look for a larger distributor cap ?

The distributor is of the centrifugal advance type. I'm not sure as to the 
model number. I've also noted erratic spark timing at low RPM setting
(using a timing light), so wonder if I should look for a replacement ?

Thank you.

Hi, Peter.
 
>Is there a straight conversion between GL numbers and SAE numbers
 
No. SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) number measures viscosity grade,
the GL number for gear lube or Sx or Cx designation (x is letter of alphabet)
for motor oil is an API (American Petroleum Institute) test standard. For
motor oils, these generally supercede each other; an oil that meets SH-CD
exceeds the demands to meet the older SF-CC standard.
 
Just to confuse everyone still more, there is another rating roughly
equivalent to the GL grades, and that is in the mil-spec (military
specifications) system. GL 5 is also MIL-L 2105B, GL 4 is MIL-L 2105.
 
GL3 - light to medium duty transmission and final drive service
GL4 - normal duty hypoid final drive lube, heavy duty transmission service,
roughly equivalent to MIL-L 2105.
GL5 - heavy duty hypoid final drive lube, roughly equivalent to MIL-L 2105 B
 
Now here's an interesting bit of trivia. For early 911s, Porsche specifically
did NOT approve GL 5 or MIL-L 2105B gear lube, calling for GL 4 or MIL-L 2105
only. That changed with the 1972 model, and the introduction of the Type 915
transmission replacing the Type 911. The Type 915 specifically called for
single-viscosity SAE 90 GL 5 (or MIL-L 2105B), but also permitted SAE 90 GL 4
(MIL-L 2105). I just ran across this today, while translating tech specs for
a new 911 book from German to English. It also says that "This [change to GL5]
is only possible because the Porsche blocking synchromesh can easily be adapted
to work at lower friction levels."

Subject: 86'951 Running Hot

My 951 seems to be running warmer than it should. In the cold weather it 
runs to the last line on the temperature guage. The fan also runs after
the car is turned off. I just had my water pump replaced @ 99,000.
This was the second pump in less than 15,000! I have filed a claim with
PCNA (still under warranty).At the same time the water pump was replaced,
The sender for cooling # 928.606.201.01,thermofan switch #951.606.481.00,
and the fuel/temp guage were replaced. (Recomended by mechanic)

When the car is idling the temp gauge reaches the last line, but never
over in the red area. When I move again the temp falls to about the
half way mark. I don't think this is normal? The fan is coming on in
freezing weather! What is going to happen in the summer?

I thought it was standard that the thermostats (2) in the water pump are
replaced along with the pump? These parts 944.106.129.05, 951.106.311.00
are not on the parts list on my bill.

Also, the temperature switch 930.606.118.00 is still original. Could 
this be the problem? The coolant system was filled with Peak phosphate
free 50/50 mixture. The mechanic told me he bled the system twice, and
insured me that the system was bled properly.

Could I have a blocked radiator causing inefficient cooling?

I am taking the car back to have this problem resolved. The mechanic
agrees that there is some sort of problem. The shop is about 2 1/2 hours
away, thought I would post this before I see him next week.

Bernardino and San Diego Counties, with 15% of the "dirtiest" cars being
tested on the dyno. (Oh, and it will be a crime to operate a "gross polluter"
too!).
    The Scenarios given in the Nov 1994 edition of this fine piece of
literature  assuming the car fails the smog test are:

1. Fails. Cost less than $450 to fix? Pay it. It passes Test. All OK.
2. Fails. 1 repair needed, costs OVER $450. Must Pay it! No wavier.
3. Fails: 2 Repairs needed 1 costs $300, the other $600. At least the $600
repair MUST be done before eligible for a wavier!
4. Fails: 3 Repairs needed, costing $300, $350 and $700. Must do the $300 and
$350 before eligible for wavier.
5. Fails: 2 repairs needed $300 and $400. Must do BOTH!

P.S. only ONE wavier is ever granted per vehicle!

Subject: 944 still cutting out at medium revs


Thanks all for the helpful comments about why my 944 is cutting out 
whilst travelling at 50-70 mph.

I have checked all of the suggestions
1	pump - seems to be working fine

2	dodgy connects in pump wiring - all clean and good

3	throttle switch - seems to have no effect, there are in fact two 
switches in the same body one operates only with the throttle closed, the 
other operates only at 80+% open, so neither would seem to be involved.

4	damp dist cap - this would tend to produce erratic behaviour 
rather than dramatic cut outs

As far as I can tell, my fuel pump does not run until the engine is 
turning - is this normal on a 944/85

My latest theory is that I have a dodgy engine speed/position sensor 
there are two separate sensors, one controls timing + drives the rev 
counter, I am unsure what the other does ( probably metering). Presumably 
one of the sensors (via the dme) causes the fuel pump to be switched on.

The question is does this logic make sense, or am I missing something.

Subject: Bought belt tool!

Dear Porsche friends:

Well, I finally broke down and bought the infamous and expensive belt adjusting
tool for my 944. I figured it was a good investment, no more trying to 
coordinate trips to mechanic with my SO, no more paying for the adjustments,
knowing that it has been done correctly, etc.

I should have it today. I have read the directions on the fiche and from what
I gather these are the steps:

Cam belt:
1. Cold engine. Remove what you need to get the job done...
2. Release belt tension by backing up crank 10 Degrees. About 1.5 teeth on the
   camshaft gear.
3. Measure, and if necessary loosen adjuster nut and adjust.
   To tighten belt turn adjuster CCW (is this right?)
4. Advance crank a couple of turns. Repeat #2 and #3 until in spec
   Specs is 2.7 +/- 0.3 (in Porsche's Magical P9201 units :)

For the balance shaft:
Can the measurement be taking directly on the belt as it lays there or does 
the same procedure (backing the crank CCW) must be performed before a
correct reading is obtained? 

Specs are like on cam belt 2.7 +/- 0.3. 

Note: the belt has 2K miles on it, the specs for a new belt are different!

Also, I believe the adjuster turns CW for a tighter belt. Is this correct?

One final ?, the idler for the balance belt should be 0.5mm from the lower
balance drive gear. Should the balance belt touch the top part of the idler
when adjusted properly?

Thanks!!

There are a couple of things that could be causing your 
problem. Therefore, a couple of tests can help narrow down the 
source.

1) Try bridging the connector for the thermoswitch (on the 
radiator) to make the fans run *ALL* the time... If you are 
still having the problem with the high temperature, then the 
thermoswitch and the relay and fans are not the problem.

If that is the case, then you have three possible culprits:

a) The thermostat
b) The radiator
c) The waterpump

I would guess that the thermostat is the most likely culprit, you can
check it by removing and placing it in a pan of water on your (wife's)
stove, noting the temperature at which it opens.

The radiator might be clogged (the water passages) or have restricted airflow
(through pebbles etc. in the air passages)...

The waterpump may not be providing the right flow of water, but least likely 
of the three.

Good luck,

You missed my point : I know Franklin is a great driver, but his car
is not "prepared", it is stock. His beating you simply proves my point-
he did not do any of the things I mentioned that are legal in PCA : 

> These rules basically allow ANY suspension (sways, torsion bars, 
> bushings, 1" wider wheels, etc)...

His car is not prepared to the Nth degree, it is just balanced well.
He DOES have the correct car to begin with- more important than preparation.
My point is that a well driven SCCA Stock car will beat a PCA prepared 
car with an inferior driver. Of course, the PCA prepared car has an advantage
and will beat you- all other things equal. But winning autocross is mostly in
the mind and experience, car setup is not NEARLY as important. 

For more proof that a good SCCA stock car could have won any stock 
class in Boston, take my time and multiply it by the SCCA solo-II PAX factors
to get times for some of the other classes. An interesting point if you do
this : 
the 962 driven by Derek Bell (?) in an "exhibition" run, without walking the
course,
would have been competitive in SCCA Modified classes for formula cars! And
the
brakes were dragging on the 962 because it was a display car and kids fooled
around
with the brake adjustment.

This year I set my car up to PCA rules : bigger torsion bars, adjustable
spring plates,
plastic bushings, 7" wheels with 225/50/15 tires, duck tail, etc. But I did
not go
substantially faster on the autocross course. I made these modifications to
try to
win the Porsche Parade in Lake placid, but my modifications backfired when my
rear spring plate bolts came loose and I went relatively slightly slower than
when
I was stock in Boston. In SCCA events (without the spring plate
problems) I was not much faster than before.

On racetracks these mods made a much bigger improvement - the car was
more controllable and precise.

Anyway :

***  gospel divider ********

Anyone who is serious about being a top autocross driver should
keep their car STOCK and concentrate on DRIVING. Trying to 
go faster with modifications every event will take focus away from
the driving and you will newer improve what really counts- yourself.

Subject: Re: poor mileage on a 73'S

There are many possibilities here. First, it is possible the rebuilt
unit was not the correct one for this car. If it is the correct unit it
may have never ben properly set up. If it is the proper unit and it was
properly set up, someone may have messed with it later, or it may have
failed (does he know if the entire unit was rebuilt?).

When MFI pumps go bad one symptom is they run way too rich. The smell of
gasoline in the oil would indicate the poor mileage problem is due to
the MFI. This is not good because the unburned fuel gets into the oil
and changes the lubrication properties which is bad news for bearings
and other moving parts.

The MFI may not be the cause of low mileage at all. It seems to me your
friend should get his MFI checked at a shop with early 911 experience
and an exhaust analyzer. 

It is possible poor compression, valves way out of adjustment or even
ignition system trouble could cause low gas mileage. The MFI may very
well be working perfectly. I think 15 mpg on the highway is too low and
means something needs attention.

It should cost less to get the MFI right  (Assuming you can find
someone competant to deal with the MFI unit) than to add CIS or
Webers.  The only reason to trash a MFI set up is if you just can not
find someone to set the car up properly (or someone has given you a new
Weber set up for free). Don't give up on MFI. When it works right,
there is nothing like it.

larger displacement of his engine, but he said he remembers getting about 
20 mpg before the MFI job.  Can anyone help by pointing out possible

That's too high!  The gauge's movement and fan operation independently 
confirm that the water's too hot.  The gauge should be very close to 
the middle, assuming it's working OK (sounds like it is).

Peak antifreeze has phosphates, which you should avoid in aluminum 
engines.  Prestone makes a phosphate-free antifreeze in grey bottles now.

I've heard of several instances of failing radiator fan thermostat 
switches (me included).  They're cheap and medium-difficult to replace.

> Could I have a blocked radiator causing inefficient cooling?
Possible, but I would doubt it.  This sort of thing is really rare.  
But if you (or a previous owner??)  used hole-plugging crud from the 
parts store, or the thing's in really bad condition then this is more possible.

Your problem could be:
1) System still needs bleeding.  Doing it twice doesn't guarantee 
anything but a higher bill.  Doing it *right* once is more important.  
Does your mechanic *really* know how to bleed a 944?
2) Fan switch defective for stage 1 operation (light cooling)
3) Defective waterpump
4) Blowing / blown head gasket
5) Blocked water flow

Your fans have 2 speeds: stage 1 is silent and fills most cooling 
needs.  Stage 2 is like a turbine and should virtually never be 
engaged.  This is true only for 85/2 and newer 944's.

The fans respond to the water temperature near their thermostat, on the 
radiator itself.  The temp. gauge responds to the head/block water temp 
via a sensor.  Notice that there's a [normally rigid] thermal coupling 
between the two, but if for instance, your radiator hose blew out, the 
radiator fans would *not* run but the engine would overheat.

So, If both fans & gauge say the water's hot, then it almost invariably 
*is* too hot.  Air in the system can do this, but usually not to the 
degree you specified.

Hope this helps,

I had a similar problem this past fall with my 928S.  It turned out
that my car was sucking up leaves like a vacuum cleaner!  I found my
radiator had about 30 leaves plastered to it!  Every day I removed the
leaves and the overheating problem went away.  I'm not saying that this
is the problem with your car but it's worth taking a look at.

Question(s):  (Maybe dumb, but I am just starting to do my own work).

How do I check the front wheel bearings for play ?
What are the indicators that bearings are good/bad ?
Is the check for the front bearings and the rear bearings different ?
Is there a difference between how you perform the check on a 911 and a 944 ?

I whenever I put new cyliners on, I schmear some valve grinding compound

This is a St Muir VW trick.

Just thought I'd add a little note to the pile about CA smog testing.
I had an '84 Fiero (I know!! but it was a good car!). Anyway I brought the 
car to the local shop to get a smog check. The car was running very well.
The mechanic gave me the bad news, it failed the test and in his words
"I can't believe this car made it here!". He claimed it needed piston rings.
Not a chance. So I paid him his smog fee plus the time to do a compression
check. I was refered to the CARB smog ref station. I went to the smog ref
and was told that the car need a new TBI (throttle body injector) and it would 
pass "no problem". He gave me the waiver ( due to the price of the replacement
unit.) and I was on my way. Now I have two "braintrust" opinions of why the car won't smog. Some time passes and I decide to sell the car. So back to the local
shop, just to get a failure so I can go to the smog ref again. He soaks me for 
another $80 and says "This thing still runs!". Like he knows what is going on!
It fails and I'm off to see the ref again. This time I've grown a beard and look a little different. I go to the same ref station and get the same ref as before and he tells me this time that the car needs a new prom chip and the car will
pass. I get another waiver.
    Basically, I'm just triing to say that these ref don't know S**T!!(sorry for the caps but it pisses me off) CA and myself like clean air but let's get some

Help !

'82 911 SC

Before I go to drivers Ed I want to mark the maximum downshift points on
my speedometer and the optimum upshift points on my tach.  I have bought
some lovely 1/16" red and blue tape and some 1/8" white vinyl numbers for
this.

Problem:  I just checked my owners manual, the speed to rpm chart is based
on 215/60 VR 15 tyres.  I have the 16" wheel option and am running
225/50 VR 16.  How do I convert between the two (these are original and
the speedo is calibrated properly ) ?

My plan is to convert the max downshift rpm to speed to mark on the speedo
since I don't there there'll be much wheel slip/skid when I'm downshifting,
and put the optimum upshift points on the tach since there will probably
be (possibly be?) some on hard accelerating.  The speedo will just be
marked with red lines, the tach will get blue lines and little numbers
since they're all clustered together.

If your speedo was not recalibrated to match the tires, there would be
no impact whatever from wheel/tire changes on the speed/rpm indicated.
The effect would be on actual speed vs. indicated speed. 

If your speedo is recalibrated, the difference is 1.19% - the 16 inch wheels
turn an extra 1.19% as often as the 15" wheels. So your speedo would be reading
higher by 1.19%.

Watch the track - shift by ear & seat of pants. There's too much going

Subject: 914 Sheet Metal

        YES!  I did it!  The 2.0 engine came out of the car
yesterday afternoon!  I did it all by myself, with advice
from The List, and loan of tools from Josh Hadler.  Also,
thanks to Josh for letting me assist him on his first engine
removal--it gave me the confidence and let me see some of
the "gotchas".
        However, I ran into a wee little problem.  I can't
seem to get the Lower Right Warm Air Guide off the *%#&^$%
engine.  It seems that Klaus and Fritz back at Karmann used
slot-head screws to hold the sheet-metal together (it even
shows 'em in the factory manual!) and so I want to kill them.
I've got two (out of three) very stubborn screws on that one
piece of metal.  I've tried Liquid Wrench and some thumping,
but to no avail.  Every time I try to get 'em out, I wind up
chewing up the head a little bit more.  One screw is just
holding sheet-metal to sheet-metal (with one of those welded-
on nut things), but the other one goes into the case.
        HELP!  Any suggestions?  Should I just continue the
"spray-and-beat" technique for a while?  I want to get the
stupid thing off so I can clean up the leaked oil above it.
(Yecch!)
        Thanks for all the previous help, and thanks again
for any suggestions now!

The 16" wheels are original.  And the speedo is calibrated very closely
judging by the speeding ticket I got christmas eve :'(.  I just want
to make sure I'm clear here - if the max downshift rpm from 5 to 4 (eg)
says  5,000 rpm and the chart (based on 15" wheels) says 5,000 in 5th
 = 122 mph then I multiply 122 by 1.19 to give 145 as the max down shift
 speed from 5 to 4 with 16" wheels!  19% seems an awfully large difference!

Subject: Re: POR-15 and panel repair


Dear Bart,

When replacing the rear trunk floor with one of our replacement parts, it is
necessary to lift the reinforcement cap on the center brace (after cutting
its spotwelds) and then cut from left to right with a die grinder (This is
necessary because the original floor extends from the taillights to the
engine bay).

After all welding is completed, we coat all with metal ready cleaner and then
POR-15. Since both top and bottom surfaces are accessible, there is no need
to precoat. Additionally, the new trunk floor replacement is galvanized to
help protect it. Follow the instructions on the POR-15 can and spray on. You
can brush on the stuff, but this will require more sanding to get a smooth
top coat.

Next, we caulk all seams with seam sealer, prime and paint with polyurethene.
Always use proper breathing equipment and spray in an area with good
ventilation.

Dear Craig,

The AC kit we have is mounted in the so-called factory position so the
condenser mounts above a square hole cut into the bottom of the front trunk
floor. The condenser used is $150.00. It is important to decide whether you
choose to install a DPD or VPC system. Both were dealer installed, but are
different enough to not be compatible. The DPD system offers more front trunk
room; the VPC unit better cooling.

Dear Craig,

The factory has available a 914 cradle that fits a floor jack to assist in
engine removal. However, all one has to do is situate the floorjack under the
engine mounting bar. This will balance the power plant for removal.

You can certainly jack the front end with a floorjack and small piece of
plywood for cradling. Situate the floorjack directly under the center of the
cross member and jack there. Since the steering rack cover is attached to the
crossmember, caution has to be excercised when jacking, hence the plywood.

Additionally, four jacking donuts are available at the four corners of the
floor pan. These assist in jacking one corner.

Subject: Isocyanates

This is a follow-up to Peter Leckband's excellent posting
about the dangers of using paints with isocyanates 
without proper protection.

I've used SCUBA apparatus, which I think ought to be OK.  
It's probably not the best solution if you're painting all 
day, everyday, because you have to walk around with a 
tank on your back (unless you have a very long hose), and 
because you have to be careful not to let the drool that 
accumulates on the mouthpiece drip onto your beatiful 
paint job, but it does offer protection against breathing the 
isocyanate vapors.  If you do go this route, you can use a 
small cylinder, like a 30 cu ft one.  You'll use less than a 
quarter of a tank this size to do a whole car.

I also am told (or read) that one can absorb
the isocyanates through the skin, so it's a good idea to
wear something that covers arms, legs, head, etc.  (Maybe 
a  SCUBA mask for the face?  That might be carrying it a 
bit far.)

Also, if you don't want to fool with the isocyanates, but
still want to do a basecoat/clearcoat, PPG makes a 
clearcoat called NCT (New Clearcoat Technology) that is 
pretty good. It dries very fast (out of dust in a few minutes 
at most) and is nearly as hard as the catalyzed clearcoats 
with isocynates.  It's not quite as durable, at least 
according to PPG, but it's damn hard for me to tell.
I've got a red 240Z that I painted two years ago and it 
looks as good as when I did it, except for normal dings, 
etc.

1.19% at 122mph is a difference of 1.45mph.  This makes obsolutely no
difference on an SC speedo since the numbers are in 30mph increments
and white ticks are in 10mph increments.  By the way, you will have
only one upshift point on the tach.  On my stock SC I use just over
5500rpm.  All the race cars I have seen have the (up)shift point marked
on the tach.  It can be under, at, or over the factory redline indicator.
If you also want a downshift mark figure out where on the tach it is
safe to downshift from any gear.  You are only glancing at one gauge then.
My race car doesn't even have a speedometer.

If you haven't been using a marked up speedo on the street it is only
going to add confusion on the track.  Get comfortable with this on the
street before using it on the track.  The tach is easy to look at because
it is in the center.  I always glance at it when I hear the engine speed
up so I shift at the correct time.  The speedo is off to the side and the
only time I ever have time to look at it is on the straight.

It appears what you are trying to do is determine how to keep your engine
in its power range.  This is good.  If your drivers ed is on a racetrack
then ask people what gear each corner is in.  It is easy to equate a
corner to a gear.  Downshifting normally only occurs when you are also
braking.  Just remember to downshift when you are almost finished with
braking.  This allows the engine rpms to be as low as they will get.
Don't downshift when you start braking because the rpms haven't dropped
yet.

Have fun out there!

Subject: 914 Workshop manuals / engine cases

I just bought the 914 Factory Workshop manuals from GPR a few days 
ago.  Their price was something around $340.  Yeowch! But I have heard 
that they are a great resource.  If anyone has any questions about 
them, feel free to ask me in about a week when I receive them.

About engine cases: some may remember from a while back that I bought 
a 1975 914 with a 2.0L to rebuild and place into my '74.  All the 
clean air / smog check talk has made me think that perhaps I should 
use a different year case instead.  I have a case from a 1970 or 1971 
1.7L motor that I got along with 2 parts cars.  Are there any dramatic 
differences among the various years as with regards to engine cases?  
If they are all basically the same, I figure I'll use the early case 
just to be safe.  If there is a benefit to the later cases, maybe I 
should use them.  I'd appreciate some advice soon because I need to 
make that trip down to FAT performance -- you know, wallet getting too 
heavy and all....  :-)

Indeed it is! What I wrote was that the difference is 1.19 percent, not 19%!
The actual result is 122 * 1.0119 = 123.45mph - really a negligible correction.
There's no way I could tell the difference.

Subject: 914 P&C 

I will give you my $0.02 on this head gasket issue on the big air cooled 
VW engine.

All the bus/914 engine use head gaskets in the cylinder head.  The 1600 
bug/bus engines do not use head gaskets. If the case has been surfaced 
where the cylinders meet the case and the heads have been flycut insure a 
flat sealing surface, then a tight seal should be not problem.  If you 
don't want to spend the money the have the head surfaced the trick of 
using croase lapping compound to seal up the head works okay.

Now when you put in big bore piston and cylinders the thickness of the 
clyinder walls is smaller and/or the cylinder are bigger in diameter. Some 
engine builders prefer not to use the head gaskets because; One, they are 
too small or Two, the cylinder does not completely crush the gasket. The 
reasoning here is that the 1600 engine work fine without gasket so should 
the bus/914 motor. I has been my experience that this works just fine if 
the heads have been flycut and the case sealing surface is in good condition.

Hmmmm, given the amount of 914 repair info on the list lately, I'd guess not! ;)
Seriously, there are a few known (notorious?) points of failure in 944s (water
pumps, oil coolers, motor mounts) but overall they are pretty reliable.  Just
tell your friend to make sure the seller has all the maintenance receipts.  The
most important item is to make sure when the timing and balance shaft belts
were changed.  These *must* be done every 40K miles.  If the owner doesn't have
the receipts, plan on having this done right away, so you can start your
"count-down timer" from a known point.  You should have your friend plan on
taking the car to a good Porsche mechanic and having a pre-purchase inspection

I think that even 1.19 % difference is too much. Remember that the 15" 
wheels have 215/60 that gives a side wall height of about 129 mm. While 
the 16" wheel have 225/50 and a sidewall height of about 112.5 mm. With 
the 16" wheels 25.4 mm taller than the 15" and the 16" tires have a 16.5 
mm shorter sidewall the total differences in height between the 15"

Would this really change the speedo reading by 1.19% ?

Martin,
I'll be honest, my first reaction was "what the ___?" and then I remembered
the first time I went to a time trial/drivers ed. and how many little things
I worried about and how many big things I didn't know enough TO worry about
 -- then your idea made me smile.

Some words of advice:
If you have a rev limiter in the car and it works, keep your concentration
on the track, your line (braking turn-in points, etc.) and less on keeping
the engine at peak horsepower and torque or over-reving.  I would pop the
tach out and rotate it so the redline is at the top -- it won't be long
before your peripheral vision will pick up the needle as it hits high rpms.
 You are there to learn to drive your car at speed -- no matter what anyone
tells you DO NOT DRIVE FASTER THAN YOU ARE COMFORTABLE.  Most good
instructors will coach you on proper line, turn in, braking, markers to look
for on course, etc. and they will do all this at reduced speed.  Take your
time and absorb all you can and try not to get caught up in the
competitiveness, you will improve, you will get faster, and you can do it
without wrecking your car if you grow by slowly pushing your limits.  Have
fun and GOOD LUCK]

Subject: More trans oil stuff

Comment to myself re trans oil stuff. Earlier I posted that Porsche
recommended only API GL 4 trans oil for the old Type 911 trans, and
specifically said not to use GL 5. When the 915 trans came out on the '72
models, they recommended GL5, and said GL 4 was also OK.
 
But all of these recommendations were for single-viscosity SAE 90 oils, not
multigrade like SAE 75W-90 or such.
 
Continuing with my book translation, I came across some changes. They
stopped saying GL 4 was ok for the 1974 models. Beginningin 1987, they
recommend multi-viscosity trans oil, SAE 75W-90, MIL-L 2105B, API GL 5, and
that's where it stands today for the 95s.

Subject: Gear Oils Again

I have really enjoyed the response my recent post on gear oil. Some very 
good questions were raised so have I have gone out and checked out a 
few things.

1. I was wrong about the API service spec. GL-4 or Mil-L 2105 is the current 
requirement for up 1972.  The later 915 transmissions call for 
GL-5 or Mil-L 2105B NON HYPOID gear lube. A hypoid is when the pinion gear 
does not drive the ring gear at the center but rather some piont higher or 
lower than center. This type of drive places an extreme load on the ring 
gear and requires special additive to the gear lube. 

Both my factory manuals and my Porsche Spec books list non hypoid GL-5.

It is interesting to note that both my 924 and 944 books list
GL-4 or Mil-L 2105. In addition all VW, Audi and BMW manual transmissions 
call for GL-4/Mil-L 2105.
 
2. I visted with couple of my friends who own Porsche shops. One uses 
Valoline GL-3/GL-4 gear oil in all VW, Audi and Porsche manual 
transmission. The can states it is for use in Ford Tactors. The other 
uses Valoline GL-5 non-hypiod gear lube in the Porsches and GL-3/GL-4 in 
the VW/Audi's.  He said that the GL-5 non hypiod is for some kind of 
industial use.

Here is the info off the Kendal gear lube it have used before:

Kendal VW/Porsche-Audi Manual Transmission Gear Lube Part # 673-7740
	SAE 80w-90, API Service GL-4, Mil-L 2105
"Fromulated for manual transmissions and transaxless requiring special 
compoundings to satisfy the synchronizer coating requirements."

I have more to add to this but will wait to see the response first.

wide tires. The 185mm width was definitely an option in '69 though. Will
there be a noticable difference between 185 and 195mm ? I don't think 
clearance is a problem judging by look.

Subject: RE: 86'951 Running Hot


I agree with George B's suggestions.  A couple of other things to
think about.  First is whether the radiator fans come on when the car
runs hot.  If not, maybe a good sign that the thermostat is not working.
If it's not working, the coolant in the engine will stay hot (per the
gauge in your dash), but the radiator will stay cool and so not
trigger the fan switch.

You might even be able to tell this by feel with your hand.  Try touching
hoses on both sides of the thermostat.  (When my oil cooler's thermo-
stat failed, I could see high temps in my oil temp gauge, while a hand
on the oil radiator found it cool.)

Also make sure that when the waterpump was replaced, Tony
installed a new thermostat the right way.  The new ones have are
offset differently in the waterpump housing with a rubber ring and
steel washer.  The thermostat has to be oriented properly in the
housing -- it has a bleed hole in its face.

When you are moving on the highway, the radiator fan is *not* a
factor in cooling the engine.  In fact, its blades impede cooling by
blocking a certain amount of fresh air flow.  I would say that if you
still see the needle at midpoint while cruising on the highway,
your problem is not the radiator fan or fan switch.

If you have been good about changing coolant once a year, and
I suppose sticking with the phosphate-free stuff, I don't think radiator
plugging should be an issue.  I could be wrong, though; this is just
from limited personal experience.

Unlikely that it's the waterpump.  BTW, the EuroSelect remanufactured
waterpumps are crap, in my opinion.  Most offended by the fact that
they pretty them up by spray painting them silver, yech.  However,
Porsche is currently paying $100 for cores and will buy them without
regard to exchange, sweet deal.

Hope this helps.

I got one of the "new" letters to have my 73 914 2.0 checked under the 
new system where you take you car to the ""State"" station and they go 
through it cover to cover. I know I was in trouble when they couldn't 
find the charcol canister. For you non 914 types it sits right on top of 
the gas tank.

The next step was to get the car on the dyno. Well my 914 is an 
autocross car and would not get on the dyno frontwards. To me it looked 
like it would fit if tried backwards but I didn't say anything.

They just aborted the testing gave me my "hat" and sent me on my way.

Another two hours lost in the support of clean air.

Very wise words, as well.

Most "accidents" at driver education events involving student drivers (at
least, at Rennsport's events), when investigated, come down to this - a
student being pushed by an instructor to do things that the student is
uncomfortable doing.

If you're a student at a PCA driver's education event, and you're not
comfortable with your instructor, SAY SO! If necessary, ask for a different
instructor! It is *your* car, and *your* life. No doubt your instructor is a
great driver, but that doesn't mean he or she is a great teacher, or has a
fifth sense of when you're not comfortable.

I know there's a certain amount of ego (well, a lot, actually :) in these
kinds of situations, but, to be blunt, bent sheet-metal sucks.

Subject: Blanchard Grinding/Rotors

To those that inquired about Blanchard grinding, including a p-philer by the
name of Jonathan Blanchard (whose grandfather probably invented the process)
I offer the following explanation which I hope is reasonably accurate;
Blanchard grinding is the process where a piece such as a rotor or a flywheel
is placed on a table that rotates. While the rotor is spinning a stone is
held against the rotor. The stone is also turning but on an axis that is
different than the rotor and in the opposite direction. The result is a
smooth finish that looks like cross hatching. The finish that is imparted is
a function of the coarseness of the stone.
The advantage is that you are not cutting the rotor as you do in turning,
where the rotor ends up with undesirable micro grooves. Turning the rotor is
actually grooving it and grinding is a whole different deal where abrasion is
taking place.
 Any metallurgists please comment as I don't know the exact consequences of
either method.
Once one side of the rotor is done it is perfectly flat so when it is flipped
over to do the other side it will be parallel to the first side. 
If you look at a new rotor or flywheel you will notice the distinctive cross
hatch pattern that signifies that the Blanchard grinding method was used.

Subject: Re: Letter from Monty Smith re:Parade Club Race

Hi Drew -

Yes, the National office has for years resisted any wheel to wheel 
driving in P-club.  It was not until the last two years that any for of 
it has appeared associated and supported by the National office.  For 
years we have had to go else where to do anything like this.  Before the 
best we could do was time trialing, but timing was always limited to 
individual cars while practice sessions had abour 25 cars spaced out 
around the track with limited passing.  Passing was limited because cars 
were grouped by times and by the areas of the track (i.e. no passing in 
the corners or no passing between turns X and y, etc.).

Parade has always been rather limited because of the nature of it.  Many
people bring their pride and joy on vacation and the idea is to have fun. 
In the past, when racr tracks have been used for the driving event, we
have totaled a few cars and that puts a damper on the activities.  I can
remember a 911 hitting the final end of the guard rail at PIR in 1980 and
doing endovers down the main straight.  We also lost at least two cars
coming out of turn 14? (final right hander heading up hill to start/finish
at Raod America in 1984) at the Chicago Parade.  It was not pretty and
very disheartening for the Parade entrants.  There was also a bad (if not
totaled) car accident at Riverside during the "autocross" at the Costa Mesa 
Parade in 1985.  Since then no more racetracks.  And I can understand.

But I though this was going to be only for "licensed" personnel and not 
all Parade entrants.  I thought it was going to a seperate event and not 
even associated with Parade.  Guess not!

The thing I don't understand is why if we are not using racetracks 
anymore, do the drivers of modified cars need to wear driving suits etc. 
to compete.  I can see it for racetracks but not for an autocross.  In 
SCCA or other PCA autocrosses we can wear shorts and no shirt if we like.  
Doesn't make sense.

Well maybe we'll see you in Reno if our SCCA schedule permits.

All of the respondents to Mike Kehr's post made the reasonable and
appropriate suggestion of checking the thermostat for proper opening.
These are quite easy to test, *assuming* you can get the silly thing
out of the pump while the pump is still bolted to the engine!  The
challenge, of course, results from the minimal clearance in front of
the pump.  I own two pairs of (reversible) snap ring pliers.  The
first pair is big and hefty, with the proper sized tips to engage the
big mutha snap ring that holds the thermostat in the pump mouth.  This
pair is way too big to get anywhere near the target.  My other pair is
small enough to get at the ring (even had to bend that pair up a bit
though), but the tips are too small to squeeze and hold the ring
firmly enough to coax it out of its groove.  I spent a couple of hours
one afternoon trying to pull my thermostat for testing, only to give
up in complete frustration.  What appears to be needed are small,
compact pliers that can accommodate the larger tips.  I have not been
able to find such a thing, even in the pro tool catalogs like Snap-On
and Mac.  Has anyone found a slick tool/trick to make pulling the
thermostat from an installed pump easier/possible?

Subject: 931 tranny plug & intercooler

Greetings Porschephiles!

With all the talk recently about transmission fluid, I decided to change
mine: 
I discovered a nice tool to remove these  plugs on the 1980 924 Turbo's with
the 016-Z style Porsche box.  The problem is that the clearance between the
transmission carrier and the filler plug is so tight that a conventional tool
will not fit.  I found a tool at my local Euro parts store which is intended
to be used with a standard 3/8" socket wrench.  The trick is to use a 17mm
(open end or ring) wrench arround the bit that protrudes from the
transmission when the tool is inserted.  This allows enough room for the
insertion of the removal tool.  The tool cost $5 and is made by Empi (part #
00-5773-0).
By the way, the plug on my particular car was INCREDIBLY tight (100 ft/lbs
plus probably) so I had to fashion an extension for the 17mm wrench to
increase the leverage.  The fluid was filthy - black/brown with quite a few
metal shavings on the magnetic drain plug - a change was definitely in order!
 I am hoping that a change to synthetic will solve the problem of the car
sometimes refusing to go into 1st gear.

My 931 is up on axle stands at the moment while I research ways to install a
Renault Fuego intercooler - the intercooler I finally decided on.  It is a
nice looking aluminium unit - and includes a fan installed on the back.  This
will be advantegeous at lower speeds when the air flow through the
intercooler is low.  I am planning to use a pressure switch to activate the
fan at 3 Psi or so (have not decided for sure yet).  I have made a model of
the intercooler dimensions to make sure it will fit (before I buy) ... in the
area where the oil cooler, water bottle & headlight bracket now resides.  The
oil cooler will be shifted to the drivers side (lengthening the pipes) and
the metal bracket on the back of the passenger side headlight will need to be
cut off (some way to stop the light shake as a result of this still to be
engineered).  Slight 'clearancing' of some sheet metal will be required -
nothing too dramatic though.  Once the intercooler in installed, my local
turbo shop will fabricate the pipes needed to go from the turbo to the
intercooler and from the intercooler to the throttle body.  The wrecking yard
that has the intercooler wants $200 for it ... seems a bit much as this
months European Car mag (where I saw the Fuegi IC) showed a whole engine
complete with all the bits for $300! (about to be installed in a Lotus
Europa).

Any ideas/comments/help appreciated - 
regards -

Subject: 15" vs 16" wheels 

I think that even 1.19 % difference is too much. Remember that the 15" 
wheels have 215/60 that gives a side wall height of about 129 mm. While 
the 16" wheel have 225/50 and a sidewall height of about 112.5 mm. With 
the 16" wheels 25.4 mm taller than the 15" and the 16" tires have a 16.5 
mm shorter sidewall the total differences in height between the 15" 
wheels and tires and the 16" wheel and tire is less than 10 mm.

Would this really change the speedo reading by 1.19% ?

 - Tom Feller

- ------------------------------
I think you need to divide the extra inch on the wheel by two, don't
forget you have a tyre wall above and below.
So add 12.7 mm to 112.5 and get 125.2

Either way either 205/55 or 225/50 is correct for 16" wheels.
The tread depth has more effect on gearing so unless our
friend who started this chat, and who's name I've lost (sorry),
wants to re-calibrate as the tyres wear out I'd say leave
as the original values.

I don't remember the original poster's level of experience, but I got
the impression that he is about to attend his first driver's school.
If that is the case, my recommendation is to skip all of the "optimum
shift point" effort, and save it for later. In my experience as an
instructor, most students are massively overloaded with new information
at their first school. I believe that the hardest part they have to
learn is the line for the track, and how to drive it smoothly and
consistently at a set of gradually increasing speeds. Optimizing
shift points simply drains off some mental energy which could be
better used elsewhere. Besides, gear choices coming out of corners,
etc. will all change drastically as the student's speeds increase
through the corners. I tell new students to put the car in 3rd and
leave it there. Upshift to 4th on the longest straight, if you
can't stand backing off at 80 or 90 MPH, or if you are in a 914,
where 3rd gear doesn't go very fast. The idea is to get issues of
gear selection out of your mind while you are learning the hard
stuff, which is cornering.

For intermediate students who can drive the line smoothly and
consistently at a respectable pace, duplicate the gear choices
for each corner used by the fastest driver you can find with the
same car as yours (including gear ratios and wheel diameter),
as suggested by another responder, and then "grow into" those gear
choices as your cornering speeds continue to increase. 
I support the idea of not becoming too
instrument dependent, with specialized marks all over the place.
You should be looking at the track, not flying IFR. Perhaps look
at the tach to upshift at the redline, but most everything else
can be done by feel. As someone suggested, if you do your downshift
late in the braking period, there won't be a problem with revs
(assuming you really needed to downshift for that corner).

By the way, I employ the same philosophy on braking. For the
beginner, brake early and often. Be done with braking in time
to get the corner right. When you have cornering mastered at some
reasonable level, then start to refine braking technique. Unless
you already toe/heel naturally, don't try to learn it the first
day, on top of everything else. At the end of your first day you will
probably have some perspective on why heel/toe is desirable. You
then have all of your street driving time to practice it before
your next event (when your foot slipping off the brake won't be
as big a disaster, hopefully).

When I bought the car I rotated the tach to that peak torque is at the top
and rotated the speedo so that speed in 3rd at peak torque is at the top.
I also rotated the temp/oil press so that at a good temp and oil press
(at high rpm) they are straight up and down respectivly.  My goal was that
under high power (ie on straight or just stabilized out of a turn, which
is really the only time I'll have time to look), one glance should show all
needles ponting in the same direction - if not somethings wrong.

would you suggest changing this setup ?

===============
compact pliers that can accommodate the larger tips.  I have not been
able to find such a thing, even in the pro tool catalogs like Snap-On
and Mac.  Has anyone found a slick tool/trick to make pulling the
thermostat from an installed pump easier/possible?
==============

Here's what I did just a few weeks ago on my 944. I also have a set of C ring
pliers, but as Milo points out, they are worthless while the WP is in the car.

Here's what I did: got a nail punch that was small enough to fit in the C-ring
hole. I also got a small (~2.5"), flat blade screw driver. I then hooked up the
C-ring hole with the nail punch and compressed it enough (towards the center...)until I was able to fit the SD between the C-ring and the WP body. You then 
kind of work the SD around the circumference and get it out.

The trick is to have tools short enough to get leverage as you do this. I 
usually get the front wheels on ramps any time I get to work on the bottom
of the engine to get enough clearence. About 8". 

Boy, did I do that a lot in the past few weeks. Had a pesty 
oil leak on the oil cooler, that dripped right on the balance shafts, PS pump
and masked itself as a lower bal shaft seal leaking due to the way the oil
flowed on the PS supporting bracket.

Had to take the head apart twice :) First time for bent valves
Second time went a lot faster. Found out the oil cooler does not come
out with the exhaust headers in place :(. 

Should have changed the oil cooler seals the first time, but then
again the internal seals were not leaking. Got an upgraded gasket from Zims.
It is one piece of metal with the 3 oil cooler seals embedded into it. Much
better design than 3 individual ones.

I too experienced EXTREME water temps after putting the engine back together.
This follows the recent thread on 944 with high temps. The gauge was pegged
for the longest time (really scary). There was no water flow until the
thermostat opened. Oil got really thin, pressure was like 0.5 bar. It took
a long time for the sucker to open up. Head was hot, thermostat was not 
open and as a result nothing was going though the radiator. Therefore, the
fans would not go on since fan switch was cold!

Once thermostat opened, gauge showed cooling, fans went on. I made sure that
the system was bled by openning the screw a few times and making sure that I
was getting antifreeze and not steam. 

I guess, I would do it again (hopefully not for a long time), I would carefully
fill up the engine block with antifreeze so the system will bleed much faster.

These were my experiences. I hope they help someone out there. Feel free to
ask questions if you need more info...

The problem with any grinding of rotors, is the heat treatment history. If
the rotor is being ground or turned cause its warped, it will continue to
warp the next time it gets hot, regardless of how pretty it was after the
grinding/turning. When it comes to brakes, it ain't worth the risk. Of

Yes, because the sidewall height gets added to the diameter twice...

Subject: sparkplugs, antifreeze, and brake fluid!

I getting ready to start my winter maintenance on my '84 928.  I'll start with changing the spark plugs (61000 mi now), and I'll flush the cooling and brake 
systems.  A few questions:

Plugs:  I was reading the archive about plugs - I didn't really see a general consensous on what the best plugs was.  Scott Jensen prefers the NGK Palladium. 
 Kevin Gross's opinion is that among quality plugs, they're just a commodity.  Bosch Copper may be considered better than platinum because of the larger 
electrode (lass potential to foul, misfire).  Any other thoughts?  If I go NGK, where can I find them (Cincinnati/Columbus/Cleveland Ohio)?

Antifreeze:  I thought I would look for the phosphate-free Prestone, distilled water, and use a bottle of Prestone's super flush.  Will the flush help?  Are there 
any adverse side effects?  Any comments?  A post on rec.autos.tech suggested a "low silicate" formulation for an aluminum engine, but this is new to me, 
anyone heard of this?

Brake Fluid:  After reading FAQ's and archives I think I should stay with DOT-3.  Is DOT-5 better?  Why? Better feel?  Lasts longer?  With DOT-5, I've 
never flushed a brake system before and would be afraid that I didn't completely remove all moisture.  Since DOT-5 doesn't absorb water, it may collect and 
rust brake system components.  Also, I've read that DOT-5 has a lower boiling point than DOT-3?  Is there any particular brand of brake fluid that works 
really well (DOT-3 or DOT-5)?

My car is a summertime daily driver.  My primary goal is to maintain the car in top condition as cheaply as possible, without sacrificing performance.  I.E.  I 
don't want to use DOT-5 if DOT-3 is "pretty close" and I'd have to flush DOT-5 every year...   or, plugs that won't last...

While I'm posting, let me say that I think this list is great.  Thanks to Stan for its continued operation!

I am fowarding this to the list, for whomever is interested. This is a reply 
about the hot running 86'951. 

From: Ralph Forey


Mike,


        The cooling system on these things is a continual source of worry and 
frustration for me too (85/1 944).  When I had my oil cooler gasket/seals 
replaced, the mechanic didn't realize that he had forgotten to put coolant 
back  in until after I had driven and noticed the symptoms of this problem (as
you probably realize, these cars don't air cool very well at all).  Then, he 
never fully got the air bubble out of the head, and I spent ~ 1 hour bleeding 
and filling the system until I was comfortable that I had gotten most of the 
air out.  Now, it still runs slightly hotter than it used to (just over the 
"center" line when cruising on the highway), but I am attributing it to the 
oil that was put in (Kendall 20W50 instead of the Valvoline 10W40 that I'm 
used to putting in).  I have also replaced the coolant temperature fan switch 
several times (once after the water pump died) and still find that it is 
temperamental; most of the time it turns on when the temp hits the last yellow
line, sometimes it waits longer, sometimes less.  It also seems to change when
there is a  change made somewhere in the system; for example water pump 
replaced or radiator flush and fill.  The other thing that makes this even 
worse is realizing that the switch in the radiator and the temperature gauge 
are measuring different things; 
one coolant temperature in the radiator, the other coolant temperature in the 
head.  Then, throw in a faulty thermostat and other anomalies (one fan not 
working) and then we're in for some real fun.


It is amazing with all this confusing information we are presented that we 
don't hear about head gaskets blowing more often.   

Also, sometimes I'd just like to take it back to the mechanic and tell him 
"make it run like it used to (or better) using the these new parts that you've
put on" but in light of the above behaviors this is probably unrealistic.

PS.  If you think that this may be important to anyone else, forward it to the

Hi Milo,

I haven't really had your problem with the t-stat snap ring.  For me, it 
was,
one time, an issue of its orientation within the housing which made it
difficult to remove while the pump was in the car.

Snap On does make a ton of snap ring pliers, and they sell a boxed set
of all the ones you could ever want.  There are probably only a few
you really need.  Personally, I own a mid-sized one for snap rings and
one with the angular points you need to remove 944-series CV snap
rings (acute angle ends rather than holes, if that makes any sense).

Is it just me, or is the new "Boxster" a gorgeous car?  I have very

It stated that the engine would be in the back, but might be water

also predicted it would be a flat-6 producing around 200Hp.  They said 
that the suspension would be derived from the latest 911 series of cars

This article has good photos, but really leaves me a lot of unanwswered

Subject: Splitfires


Hi all,

I have done some testing of the Splitfire plugs. They do help in
low and midrange. I suspect that this is due to more electrode area 
being available than in a standard electrode configuration. 

Frankly, I can't see the added expense of Splitfires over the more 
conventional types. The quality control sucks, especially on the 
sealing gaskets supplied. The things fall off. Scott Jessen and 
others have pointed this out. I used Bosch sealing gaskets (the 
aluminum thing that looks like a washer but isn't) and had no 
problem with sealing. The `performance' instructions Splitfire 
offers are bunk. 

The 944S2 (I got it right this time) and 968 can use the Bosch DTC
plugs. These have three contacts rather than the usual one aimed at 
the electrode. These are a good plug as they do not shroud the tip and
require no indexing to achieve optimal flame propagation. You 
motorcycle types might rmember the the so-called rim-fire plugs in 
Yamaha 2-cycle engines. These work in a similar fashion.

Otherwise, index the plugs for each cylinder and you will have a better
result than using Splitfires. And save $3-$4 per plug.

I agree with everything said here (i.e. don't worry so much about

However, this comment about upshifting at redline caught my attention.
I recall a session I had with Joe Cogbill who advised me that the
optimum upshift point is at about 4000-4500 RPM on the 951 and that,
unless you weren't going to upshift at all (e.g. in a short shoot where
you're about to downshift anyway), "you're just converting gas to noise"
by delaying an upshift past that point.

===================

Ralph, on my 85.1 only the driver's side radiator is controlled by the
radiator switch. Both fans turn on only when I turn the A/C on. On my car,
the fan goes on halfway between the last line on the gauge and the hot field.
It stays on until about it reaches half way past the first line after the cold
region. I have the original switch, I don't recall its temp range, but I think
its upper limit was like 92C. Can some one confirm this?

You may want to remember that using the A/C forces both fans on. Might save you
some hot day when the switch dies. Also, in case of overheating, I would crank
up the heater, and run the heater fan at max. You will have toasty toes, but
the heater core will act as an extra radiator to extract heat from the 
engine and help to cool things down. 

That leads me to my next tip. Make sure that when you bleed the system you have the temp control on the heater at max. You want to circulate the water all
over the system.

Also, I had an intermittent right fan. As it turns out, it looks like one
of the blades was partially broken. As a result it was really imbalanced, making
lots of vibration while it ran. I took it appart an chopped off a portion of theother 2 blades. This balanced the fan. Looking around, I noticed that the 
fan connector had a cover. I removed the cover to find an unsoldered joint.
Most likely due to its vibration. After re-soldering and rebalancing the
fan runs like a champ and is a lot quieter. I don't think that the missing
blade surface will affect cooling that much.

Hope this helps someone out there!

You may want to check out the latest (Dec.?) issue of the british
magazine "Car". It features a comparison of the current 911s (C2,
C2 Tiptronic and C4). I think the author's choice was the C4 by
a very small margin.

Timo
- ------------------------------

Timo,

This may be late in responding to your email but here's some
perspective from my C4 buying experience.


I was looking for an 1988-1993 Carrera 4 a while ago (this was before
the 993 C4 was available)  and got very helpful advise from really
nice folks on this mailing list. I've appended a summary of the best
excerpts hoping to return the favor and benefit others. By the way, I
hope you original authors don't mind my leaving your names on. See
Below. 

Also...
As a recent 1990 C4 Targa owner, here is a short synapses of my own
buying criterion and experiences. Please keep in mind these are
*personal* opinions and not meant to cause a C2 vs C4, 911 vs 944,
etc. etc. flame war. I respect and appreciate all that the marque
stands for.  

So, here goes...

REASON FOR BUYING: 
  1. Have been driving BMWs (530i, 535i) for 12 years and wanted
     something on the wild side (used to build and drag motorcycles).
  2. Always wanted something very quick and yet predictable.
  3. Drove many 911s (friends) in the past but personnally didn't like
     the oversteer characteristics (exactly like a motorcycle when you
     hit an oil slick, water, etc. while in a turn. Controlable but
     with surprises and excitment). So, never bothered to buy.
  4. I don't drive cars to their limits of adhesion but do like
     spirited jaunts on mountain roads.
  5. Like to go through the gears a and feel the raw acceleration.
  6. Enter C4. Curious.

RESEARCH:
  1. Obtained all the articles from Car&Driver, R&T, Excellence
     magazines. All the write-ups were very favorable.
  2. Obtained excellent owner input, see below, and examined all the
     records of the C4 owners I visited to make sure they had the
     factor upgrades or showed no problems.

DECISION TIME:
  1. Bought a white 1990 Carrera 4, Targa in immaculate condition.
     When I took it into the dealer for the first time the mechanic
     said "congratulations on your new car." I told him it was used.
     He took a long second look.

     COMMENT to Porsche North America (if you are listening):
         You've produced a product that has expanded your market to a
         new set of buyers. Thanks. 

EXPERIENCE:
  1. Have had nothing but fun over the last several months. The C4 is
     totally predictable and when I switch back and forth from driving
     the C4 and BMW 535i I'm not surprised by different handling
     charteristics, meaning they are both neutral. Of course, the C4
     is much more potent in raw power and doesn't lean in the turns.
  2. The acceleration is like driving a drag bike. Point it, punch it
     and hang on. 1st and 2nd gear are always a blurr. In the
     beginning months I used to hit the over rev cutout all the time
     because I was just hanging on for dear life. Now I only reach the
     rev cutout/limiter once in a while. Thank goodness for this
     engine saving feature. 

ROAD WARRIOR EXPERIENCE:
  1. I'm pretty saftey concious so don't engage in races etc.
     However, folks in other cars seem to alway want to provoke. So.
     On different occasions had a Saab, BMW 540i & Volvo (the fast
     one), tailgating me through the mountain roads and with ease I
     wisked away. They tried hard but... 

  2. Though the magazine articles talk about burning the clutch to get
     good 0-60mph times, I never felt it was a good way to abuse the
     car. However, during these rainy days, I decided to drop the
     clutch one day and experienced a loud roar from the tires and then
     sling-shotted down to the next stoplight. What a delightful
     experience, exceptional wet condition control compared to my
     535i. ...and by the way, the Corvette in my rearview mirror was
     still spinning his rear wheels.

Happy Driving!

I've heard that there were certain factory upgrades that were
mandatory.  But I don't know what they are.  I just sent you a list 
of who is on the Porsche group.  You can paiste in the addresses of
the C4 owners and ask them to share their feelings about the C4.

I would happy to spend 15 minutes going thru some of the details
of purchase price strategy, maintenence, records etc...

Hi Carson,

Mine is a '90 C4.  So far it has been trouble-free and GREAT FUN to drive.  I 
am not an aggresive driver and don't push the car all that hard.  I have come to
really appreciate how responsive it is and how much easier it is to drive. 
Though I have read about some feeling the C4 was less "tossable" than a C2.

There has been just one factory recall for me.  It has to do with a resistor in
the heater circuit not having adequate wattage rating.  Using heater during 
prolonged autobahn driving could lead to fire.  Replacing it was not a big deal.

There was one other (much more serious) problem that was discussed in the 
porschephile group.   It has to do with oil leak affecting 1989, 1990 & 1991 
C2/4.  There was no recall notice but dealers will perform necessary work if
there is indeed a problem with your car.  This info was from another netter,
Quincy Dong (QLD1@pge.com), perhaps he can give you more insight (I don't 
want to use his exact article without his consent).  

Hope this is of some help, and you will be a happy C4 owner. 

Alf

Carson,

I have a 1990 Carrera 4 and I love it!  Especially after having taken the 
Autocross class at Candlestick.

There are some concerns you should know about:
	-  The radio for the 89 & 90 is connected to the alarm system.
	   If you take the radio out and it is not properly grounded, the car
	   alarm will "go off" without the usual siren going off, therefore
	   your battery will drain down without you knowing the cause.

	-  There was a recall of the cruise control that the factory fixed.

	-  I think there was another recall on the fuel system--I don't 
	   remember exactly what, but the factory fixed that.

	-  There is something about the 89-91 having some cylinder heads
	   leaking oil.  I haven't been able to get the factory to change the 
	   heads yet, but I'm working on it.  The engine has to have some 
	   oil leakage before the factory do anything about it.  The factory
	   won't fix it unless there is a problem.
	   It's for engine numbers 62 M 06836, M64.01 for manual transmission
	   and 62 M 52757,M64.02 for Tiptronic transmissions.

	   This involves new set of pistons and cylinders and machining the
	   heads to work with the new "head gaskets".

I can't remember what other recalls there was, since the car is fairly 
new--the owners probably had all the recalls done automatically since it 
didn't involve additional $.

The C4 is heavier than a C2 and therefore to a "race driver" the C2 is a 
faster car to race in.  It's like the old "ABS" syndrome, the race drivers can 
brake better w/o ABS than race a car that has ABS.

With the C4, you'll have an extremely hard time throwing the tail out.  It's 
kind of like the best of FWD and RWD all rolled up together.

I can't compare to a regular C2 since the C4 is my first Porsche.  From all 
the articles I read, the C2 was a better car to drive fast!  But after the 
auto-x school, I think the C4 was a better car "all around".  It's kind of the 
lazy-man's way to drive and not have to work hard and still have the fun of 
driving a sport car.

Let me know if you have anymore questions.

Carson,

The auto-x school was put on by the Loma Prierta (sic) region of the Porsche 
Club, or inother words the Zone-7 auto-x.  There is one going on this August 
because they has such huge turnout for the one in April.  I highly reconmend 
it because of the amount of track time for your car.  You really learn the 
limits of your car in a controlled enviroment.

Hank Watts coordinate the school.  He's the guy who wrote SOLO DRIVING and you 
get a copy of his book before the school to read.  They offer this class every 
year and you will learn about the dates from various "Porsche" magazines.  I 
learned about the school through the Porschephilies.

Hi Carson,

I just called my Porsche dealer/mechanic and asked him what he
thought, and I've included his comments in the text below.

My dealer told me that the first two model years (89 and 90 I believe)
had problems with the clutch - nothing serious, just requiring early
replacement of the clutch plate.  Porsche subsequently beefed up the
material in the clutch and since then everything is ok.  If you buy a
car from one of the first two model years and it still has the
original clutch, then it may require replacement soon.  However, once
you do replace it, you get the new clutch and everything is ok.

BTW, the clutch on the C4 does tend to go faster than that of the C2
for one very simple reason: if you drop the clutch on a C2, you can
spin the rear wheels.  On the C4, you can't spin all four wheels (too
little torque), so the clutch burns instead.  I did this a couple of
times at the beginning, much to my embarassment.  But once you get the
behaviour worked out and know how to treat it, it's no problem.

There were also a couple of recalls on the first model years (to do
with the Motronic and/or cruise control, according to the dealer).
Mine hasn't been recalled (yet).

Apart from that, I haven't heard anything negative.  My car is '92,
and I've never had anything go wrong with it, but then I've had the
dealer service it in accordance with the Porsche requirements.  This
is expensive in itself, unfortunately.

One other thing: the standard C4 suspension setup from Porsche has
pretty nasty understeer.  If you don't plan to drive on the track it's
probably fine.  I didn't enjoy it because I've had a couple of 911's
and I missed the old behaviour.  My dealer had the suspension setup
changed so that the car handled almost neutrally, just a touch of
oversteer.  You might want to think about this, but this can be done
at anytime.

You probably already know this, but with Porsches it always makes
sense to buy the latest model year you can afford.  Reason: the
factory has a policy of making running improvements, so each model
year there are changes.

Also, there's a book about the C4 which is worth reading.  If you're
interested I can get the details from home and send it to you.  It
explains in some detail how the 4WD system works etc.

Great decision to get a C4!  It's the only 911 I've ever had where I
actually felt comfortable beating it around a bit on a wet road.  And
the 4WD is great when it snows.  It's the only true "all weather"
sports car I've ever owned.

Good luck in your search.  Please let me know if you have any other
questions.

Cheers

Chris

Hi Carson,

Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner, but I've been out of town.  I'm not an
expert on which years are better or worse, but I'm happy to share my
experience.  I have a 1991 Carrera 4 Targa, which I enjoy thoroughly.  It is my
daily driver in all seasons.  The targa is great in the warm months and the
all-wheel-drive makes the winter no problem at all (it snows here, sometimes a
lot).  I also do Porsche club drivers ed events at a nearby track, which I
highly recommend.

I've only had one recall and it was for a resistor on a blower in the engine
compartment which could overheat and cause a fire.  The dealer replaced it in a
few minutes.  I did have some clutch-related problems and I was worried that
Porsche would blame the track driving.  Porsche replaced the clutch and a few
other components at their expense and with out my even asking.  I think the C4
clutch and flywheel has had several refinements which makes me believe that it
had problems at first.  Mine works fine now, but with one strange thing:  when
it is cold (<0C), it smells funny if it is slipped even slightly.

I also had a problem with the fuel-level sending unit that ended up being
frustrating to get fixed.  Now and then it would just quit.  Porsche replaced
it, but the new one didn't always indicate correctly, so they replaced it, too.
 Then fuel started leaking around the seal where it enters the gas tank.  It
took several tries to get that fixed.  When my mechanic called Porsche, they
said they have had this happen now and then and that they had a specific
procedure to get it sealed.  (Install a new seal, torque it down, drive it for
15 minutes, torque it down again).  It worked that time.

Oh, I also had most of the snaps in the front trunk carpet pull out of the
fabric.  The dealer fixed them at no charge.

Other than that, I've had routine maintenance plus a some extra expenses from
doing track events.  The regular service is a little pricy -- your mechanic can
tell you what the typical charge is for a particular service (15K, 30K, etc.). 
I flush the brake fluid for each track event and have used more brake pads and
tires than normal due to the track driving, but this is definately worth it.  I
learned to do the brake work myself and that cut down the cost consderably.  I
also don't use Porsche pads because they are too expensive and there are better
ones around (I'm using Repco Metalmasters right now, but I think I'll try Cool
Carbon next time).

There is one other thing I should tell you.  If I were buying again, I might
not get a C4;  I'd consider a 2-wheel drive coupe instead, but only because I
like the track events.  The C4 doesn't handle as well as a C2 (on dry pavement)
and the targa is heavier and has more flex in the body.  On the other hand, I'd
really miss being able to take the top off and would feel like I needed a
different vehicle in the winter.  Hmmmm.  Maybe I just need another Porsche....
;-)

Hope this helps.  Have fun!

 -Marc

The book is called "Carrera 4: Porsche Allrad von 1900 - 1990 /
Porsche 4 wheel drive from 1900 - 1990."  Publisher is Suedwest
Verlag, Munich.  It's in both German and English (alternating pages in
each language).  You can certainly order it from Toad Hall Motorbooks.
It's got quite a bit of information about how the C4 differentials are
controlled etc.  The Porsche owner's manual tells you practically
nothing.

It does.  I live in Switzerland and used the C4 to go skiing quite a
bit last year.  You still need winter tyres, and it's important not to
forget that although the C4 will get you moving much better than any
other 911 on an icy road, it won't stop you any faster :-).  I did
have to be careful not to get lulled into a false sense of security.

Please let me know how it goes with the search for your car.  The new
model of the C4 based on the 993 is coming out in a month or so, that
might result in some good later models becoming available as people
buy the new one.

Cheers

IMO

Putting things into percpective, the Targa has minimal body flex
compared to the majority of open topped cars on the market today.
I doubt you would even notice it much but it depends on what you are
used to.  Sure, angle the car up a steep driveway and you will hear the
creek as the targa rollbar fights to counter the torsional flex, but then
even my coupe does that.  Ask Ehab about his Targa compared to his
Supra, he was very concerned about this before he bought his.

Subject: Some 928 buying questions from a newbie

Hi all,
I'm a new porschephile.  After reading some of the recent archives and
lurking for a few days I have some questions I hope you can help me
answer...
I live in San Jose, CA, and intend to purchase a used 928S or S4 soon.

Here are my questions.

1) Where are all the used S4's?
I saw a few in Hemmings, but they're on the east coast.  Haven't seen very
many out here.  Someone told me that was because Porsche sold thousands of
928's each year in the US in the mid-80s, but sales dropped off because
prices went up so much and they sold only 200 928's in 1992. (Ouch!)   Or
am I just not looking in the right places?

2) If there are that few S4's, are the differences between the S and S4
worth the time it takes to find one?
(I don't want to start a "my xxx is better than your yyy because=8A" war
here.  Maybe it would help if I say I'm mostly interested in reliability
and handling).

3) I noticed that not many of the vocal porschephiles seem to own late
model 928's.  Is there something you know that I should know?

4) Why are there so many automatic 928's?
Someone told me that 80% of the US 928's were automatic, and almost all of
the ads I've seen are for automatics.   Is there a reason for that?  Did
buyers stay away from the 5-speed because they're unreliable?  IMHO, a
stick is so much more fun to drive.

5) Is it worth the extra money to find a 928 with very low mileage (< 30K)?
One dealer told me that 200K miles was easy for a Porsche kept in good
condition (so I should buy his 928 with 70K).  My '87 non-Porsche is giving
out after 80K.

6) I have my heart set on a shiny black 928.  If all I can find is a
non-black car, (and I'm not too concerned about lowering the resale value
by having it repainted...) what kind of paint job should I get that's
worthy of a Porsche?  I don't want a $99 Earl Scheib special, but I don't
want a $10,000 300 coat Imron laced with gold dust only-to-be-looked-at
showpiece either.

Some Bay Area specific questions:
7) Anybody had good/bad dealings with California Motorsports in Mountain
View?  They had a nice selection of used 911's, some 944's and one 928S.
The guy seemed to know what he was talking about, but it probably isn't too
hard to fool me (at this point).

8) Can anyone recommend a good pre-purchase inspection place in the Bay
Area, and (if different) a good mechanic I can establish a long-term
relationship with?
This is probably the most important question for me.  I wouldn't know a
timing belt from a bicycle chain (yet).

Thanks for any help or advice you can offer.

Hi folks,

I have a question for the 911 experts out there.  I am just finishing up 
and overhaul an a 77 2.7L.  My parts suppiler sent me the wrong P&C set, 
911.103.928.01, one catalog list these as "1973-76 Carrera, 2.7, Euro". I 
don't have Spec book on that list this engine. The pistons have a dome 
rather than the bubble on standard 2.7 pistons. The CR is less as the 
same for both pistons sets.

Did it have MFI or carbs? 
Has anyone ever run these on a CIS car?

I have the right one comeing on Thursday, I just want some more info this

I haven't done it for a 951, but a plot of rear axle torque versus
speed (i.e.engine torque curve, translated through each gear ratio, etc.)
for my 944S shows that the red line is the right spot for all shifts.
Another way to do the same analysis is to look at rear axle HP as a
function of car speed, which requires a bit less arithmetic (please
don't start the torque/HP discussion again unless you think about
it for a while first- rear axle HP versus car speed really does work).
It might be interesting for someone to do it for other common, stock
Porsches.

By the way, in keeping with my beginner's strategy of "put it in 3rd
and leave it there", all of this shouldn't be an issue for the
beginner.

Yes, I would suggest grinding the head off and drilling the shaft out.
Usually after grinding the head off of such stuck screws, I can get the
screw shaft to unscrew, but drilling it out isn't too hard, just requires
extreme care.

All rights!!  More 928 people!  You know, I haven't seen good used S4's for a 
while either.  I think it may have to do with the low resale value and high
insurance cost of the car.  Porsche dumped many 928s on this country in the
late `70's and early `80's and consequently, there are a lot to be had for the
price of a loaded Hundai.  Very depressing.  
Anyway, my '79 has 118K and is still very strong (but it could be stronger!).  
If you're looking for a good 928, I'd get an '87 S4.  This has the 4-cam engine
and the big Brembo brakes on the front.  I think it also has the DME fuel
injection and the engine displacement is 5.0 liters.

>4) Why are there so many automatic 928's?
because these cars were GT (Luxo Barge) cars, not true sports cars.

See above.

You can save yourself a TON of dollars if you join PCA (Are you a member?)
and search through the adds in the back for spare parts to keep your beast
rolling.  If you don't have much mechanical aptitude or desire, you'd better
have a lot of cash for the repairs.  Here's a sample:

I have read that, if you have it done rather than doing it yourself, replacing
the clutch on a 928 is, ummmmm, *pricey*, and that 85 and earlier clutches
are tender (read, need more frequent replacement).

I have also read that the auto in the 928 is quite robust (it's a MBZ unit,

Subject: Some 928 buying questions from a newbie


Hi Peter, I just bought an older 928 (shinny black!) and I think I can answer
most of the questions you have below:

- ----------------------------Original message----------------------------
I live in San Jose, CA, and intend to purchase a used 928S or S4 soon.

Here are my questions.

1) Where are all the used S4's?

>Don't know why you can't find any, I thought Cal. was the Porsche capital!  I
found mine in the Washington Post


2) If there are that few S4's, are the differences between the S and S4
worth the time it takes to find one?

>There are a lot of differences between the original 928, S, and S4.  The bigge
st being between the S and S4.  The first 928 had 230 HP, the S had 300 HP and
the S4 340 HP.  There is little difference in style between the 928 and 928S
(2 spoilers and a line down the side of the car on the S).  The S4 has a re-des
igned front section and rear section with a big ol' spoiler on the rear window.
  Personally, I think they all look beautiful in their own way, but they have
decidedly gotten prettier as they get newer.


3) I noticed that not many of the vocal porschephiles seem to own late
model 928's.  Is there something you know that I should know?

I kinda have a theory that people who own the newer ones aren't as "in to" the
cars as people who own the older ones that tend to need TLC.  Basically, the ne
wer ones are probably too new to have developed problems that would require one
 to join the list and ask for help.  Also, there's not much to do to a S4, as
far as making it faster, better handling.  So, I guess that may be another reas
on why you don't see many questions from 928 S4 owners.


4) Why are there so many automatic 928's?

>If I understand correctly,the 928 was designed as a "touring" car, meaning tha
t it was supposed to be as comfortable as sporty, hence the proliferance of aut
omatic transmitions.


the ads I've seen are for automatics.   Is there a reason for that?  Did
buyers stay away from the 5-speed because they're unreliable?  IMHO, a
stick is so much more fun to drive.

>There are troubles with the synchros in earlier manual transmitions.  Mine is
starting to exhibit wear, but this just means that I have to be more aware of
my shifting and double clutch when down shifting into 2nd gear.  I'm sure that
the automatics have some probles too, though.


5) Is it worth the extra money to find a 928 with very low mileage (< 30K)?
One dealer told me that 200K miles was easy for a Porsche kept in good
condition (so I should buy his 928 with 70K).  My '87 non-Porsche is giving
out after 80K.

>There are several things that seem to go out at certain times in a 928's life.
  Most of them around 80K miles.  I bought mine with 90K miles, with the water
pump replaced, new timing belt and no problem with the gears.  It's got 102K mi
les now with no major problems.  What I can tell you is to ask about these few
things that ALL 928's have problems with:  Water pump, timing belt, steering ra
ck(leaking?), oil leaks, and 2nd gear synchros(or all of them for that matter).


6) I have my heart set on a shiny black 928.  If all I can find is a
non-black car, (and I'm not too concerned about lowering the resale value
by having it repainted...) what kind of paint job should I get that's
worthy of a Porsche?  I don't want a $99 Earl Scheib special, but I don't
want a $10,000 300 coat Imron laced with gold dust only-to-be-looked-at
showpiece either.

> I had a place recomended to me and they are suposedly the best in the area,
they said that it would be about $5,000 to do it right.  They said that the 928
 is a particullarly difficult car to paint.  I informed him that the price they
 want to paint it is about 2/3 of what the car cost me!  He said that that is
what he would charge, but he wouldn't suggest doing it, in my case.  He said to
 have fun with it, put the money into performance parts.

All in all, I love my 1980 Euro 928.  If I had to do it again, I would probably
 bought an S.  Definately get a pre-purchase inspection.  Make sure they check
the things I listed above.  Good luck, and tell us what you decide on!

(pretty peaky). This is a plot of torque vs. engine speed though: not

Peak torque is not important as far as calculating the optimum shift
points is concerned. You should shift when the torque at the drive wheels
is equal in the two gears, unless that occurs above redline, in which case
you shift at redline. The shift point is therefore well past the engine's
torque peak for most engines and most gearings. The reason for this is
that if you shift when the drive-wheel torque is higher in the gear you are
in, you miss the added acceleration you would have gotten if you didn't shift,
and if you shift when the drive-wheel torque for the gear you are shifting to 
is higher, you miss the added acceleration you would have gotten if you 
shifted sooner.  The previous comment about maximizing drive-wheel HP is 
equivalent - since at any given road speed the drive-wheel rpm is constant, 
the drive-wheel HP is directly proportional to the drive-wheel torque at that 
speed.

Peter A. recently mentioned a Japanese sandpaper that is newly available

is truly amazing. The grit scale is from 400 to 1200, based on a system
that is 1/4 the system we use (i.e. 1200=4800 our system). The back of
this sheet is rougher than the abrasive! It seems to be made of a plastic
sheet, which is very durable. I have used it for polishing rocker shafts
and arms on 356 motors to a mirror-like finish. I haven't tried it on
paint yet, but I suspect the results would be great if you had the
patience. If anyone is interested, the stuff is called "Rub-lap" and it is

Well,

The engine's just about out of the SC now, and I'm attempting to

If I get the yoke/vice setup, do I have to get a bench with 3/4"

Does the factory still make these tops ?  Only for Europe like the babyseat :-)
What are they made of ?  I would assume fiberglass.  Does this make them
lighter or heavier ? (Anything to get the weight down).

I am now going to reverse the original question.  Do the earlier tops
still fit on later models of Targa ?

Also, if anyone knows, is there a list of when the factory changed the Targa
top designs.  Or, some source of info where one might be able to figure
out which year of top will fit which year of car.

Not to start a flame-war or anything, but I think the Targa is the best

our favourite car.

Subject: RE: Threads


Stan,

There is an international standard, though I'm not sure of the name of
it. It's from the SAE and specifies the thread and type for spark
plugs with 16mm and 18mm bodies. I don't think that's a real problem.

I think the real problem lies with what the manufacturers DON"T do 
to their plugs: 
Bosch and a few other Euro sparkplug manufacturers put a special
lubricant to prevent thread siezing in aluminum and iron heads. Many
other manufacturers do not. Splitfire does not. One more reason to 
use Bosch or Beru other than the manual telling you to. I have 
examined a number of plugs and do not see this lubricant present.
This is why you should not use anti-sieze compound with Bosch or 
Beru plugs. The damn things will back out on you and the torque 
required to tighten will not be correct. It took me a while to 
figure out why a friend's 944 kept having loose spark plugs.

For you 914/4 owners, NEVER reuse a sparkplug gasket (the aluminum
washer thinge). They are designed to be used once, you will wind up 
over-torquing the plug in the tightening process. The gasket is 
designed to accept this torque in the process of being crushed. 
Without the gasket being compressed during tightening, the threads 
and area around the sparkplug boss are distorted. The metal will 
fatigue and fail or strip the threads. Clark Anderson has pointed 
this out to many 914/4 owners.

Jim,

There's another issue: German vs. US cut threads. My understanding is
that if you use US cut threads on a German head, it causes additional
metal to be displaced from the thread area. Then you go back to German
threads, and pop! the plug can blow out... Might be worth investigating
further, etc.

If you used Pi in your calculation, you didn't look at the equation very
hard:

                   (2*Pi*R1
error percentage = (------- - 1) * 100
                   (2*Pi*R2

where R1 and R2 are 1/2 the wheel diameter plus the sidewall height.
The 2*pi factor cancels out of the division, so you only have to divide
the radii, subtract 1, multiply by 100, and that's the error percentage.
As has been mentioned, an error of 1.19% is irrelevant to driving your
car. You would be better off looking at the track than worrying about
a 1 mph difference in your shift points.

Dear Bart,

It is typical for a 914 2.0 to start, run and die three times before it idles
normally (when cold of course). If you have a problem beyond that, the
auxillary air valve is not opening, your intake system has leaks, the fuel
pressure is too low or the head temperature sensor is not providing enough
resistance!)

We assume, of course, your 914 has decent compression, the valves are
adjusted and the ignition system is in great tune!

The real issue of course is that when you shift to a higher gear, 
to an RPM where the engine almost certianly develops more torque,
you have to multiply that torque by a smaller number (i.e. the gear
ratio in the higher gear) to get rear axle torque. For most typical
torque curves and gear spacings, you get more rear wheel torque by
starting with less engine torque (at a high RPM), but multiplying
by a higher gear ratio in the lower gear. This is not always the
case, hence the need to generate a curve of rear axle torque (or HP).
In any case, it is hard to get an accurate answer just looking at the
engine torque curve. You can get a good clue from the HP curve.
If it hasn't rolled over quite a bit at the redline, you will
do better shifting at the redline.

The recent discussion of emmisions testing reminded me of the time when I 
took my `76 Toyota Corolla to be tested in San Diego.  The "technician" came 
back with the news that the car had failed.  I read the slip carefully and 
saw that this "expert"* had run the test as a catalysed exhaust system.  
When I pointed out the factory sticker on the driver's door jam, he openned 
the hood and pointed to what he claimed was my catalytic converter.  My 
reply was that the part in question was actually my master brake cylinder.  
He ran the test again and the car passed.

It was also mentioned that CARB needs to hire refs who know what they are 
doing.  If they knew what they were doing, they would go into business for 
themselves rather than working for the state.

I have an '87 944 that has a self tensioner device on it.  Ive been 
running on belts (Im on my third set) installed by me, and tensioned 
with the self tensioner now for just over 60K miles.  Of course, the 
self tensioner only takes care of the timing belt, so I do the balance
belt by feel, assuming that the tension here is somewhat less critical
than the tension on the timing belt itself.  I am assuming that if the
balance belt slipped it wouldnt destroy the engine, however I imagine 
that if the balance belt broke that it would take the timing belt with it.

This may qualify as living dangerously,   .... but hey.

Subject: Should I buy this '89 Carrera?


Hello PorschePhiles,

I need some advice, I have been actively looking at buying an '85-'87 911 Carrera Coupe, 
so far I've not found anything interesting...

Well, I just returned to my office after test driving an '89 911 Coupe. This car was
advertised in the paper for $20.9K, yes $20,900. So of course I flew to this place to take a
look and to test drive it. The car has 90k miles, it is extremely clean in/out and it is a 
one-owner car.  I could not verify/review any of the maintenance & service records.  Needless 
to say, I will have the car inspected by the Porsche mechanic who works on my '88 944.

But for now my concern is of course the mileage on the car, 90,000 miles. What do you 911 
owners think about this, should I stay away from this car? I don't know much about this 
particular model year. Is there anything peculiar about this MY Carrera? I've been reading 
some recent posts about '87 Carreras having problems with temperature senders. Are there 
any common problems related to the '89 Carreras? Any comments about maintenance costs?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: re; buying a 928 (newbie advice)


  1. Availability of black/repaint; !!DON'T !! buy a car thats the wrong
     color expecting to repaint it. Since engine bay, etc is painted on 
     a Porsche repainting it right means stripping every last screw off
     it first. Only worth it if you happened to have the whole car apart.
     928s are difficult to paint well because of gasketing between the
     front and rear valances, also the trim around the driver's door doesn't
     come off (as easily as a 911, and those aren't easy cars to paint
     right either).

   2. Every car is an automatic; something like 70% of 928s were sold that
     way, I suppose its a really good automatic. The 928 shifter is not
     quick or easy, and will not survive rough handling. The clutches do 
     seem to last, even with pretty rough smokeums...  

   3. early vs. late vs S4; the early non 'S cars will take a failure of the
      timing belt and not hurt the engine. The Euro "S" models will hit,
      as will the 32-valve cars. 

   4. Reliability; the cars are great, the engines will last forever. 
      Little stuff will always fail, since its a Porsche. The radiators
      and gas tanks go bad. Its not a Honda, but it can be a reliable car.
      Avoid full leather (on the dash) as this -always- stretches and twists
      the dash, etc.  

   5. Satisfaction in driving; 928s are awesome, lots of power and phenomenal
      handling. They are heavy and don't have a sports-car feel like a 911,
      but they are very stable at any speed and will take corners faster than
      you dreamed possible. The Air conditioners really cool, the cars are
      reasonably quiet, but have a marvelous V8 sound.

         As with any Porsche purchase, just get the very best one you can
      afford and then expect to continually maintain it.

Doug,
I'm not sure if you are right. I once warped a set of brand new rotors and
yes I did go fast that weekend but the ride home was miserable!
Anyway we did Blanchard grind them and they lasted the rest of the season.
 Certainly the history of the rotor is important but It is my experience that
the warpage can be alleviated by grinding. Turning the rotors is almost
certainly counter productive.
So now I know how to bed in carbon/kevlar brakes and hopefully we won't have
to deal with that problem again

Hi Pete:

I'm speaking second-hand, but perhaps this will help.  

I have a friend who wanted a 928 and eventually bought (Summer '94) a
5-speed '89 S4 with only 13,000 miles on it.  It wasn't cheap, but he got a
lot of car for the money.  It's silver w/dark grey (?) interior, in
spectacular shape (widow selling car). He found it advertised in the DuPont
registry by a place in Missouri, I believe. This place was very
professional, on-the-level, and he bought it "sight-unseen" but thoroughly
researched.  They were used to this sort of sale. He flew out and drove it
back - one long "Italian tuneup."

HTH,

Of course the manual says to use GL-4. How critical is this?

I've driven 12,000km or 7500mi with this oil now and have had no problems

The dealer recommends Castrol 75W-90, GL-4. Any comments on this oil?

Subject: 928

*In responce to Pete's question about 928s*

Hi! I have been reading the porschephiles group for some time now, but 
this is my first post.  What really caught my intrest was this thread on 
928s.  I too am interested in getting a 928 sometime soon.  Unfortunately 
I don't think that I have the money to get a really new one, I am 
shooting for an '87 S4 but they are hard to find.

After doing a fair amount of research, It is MHO that the earliest 
year to get the 928 is in '85.  In '85 the 928 got a 5.0 liter 
engine along with 54 extra horses and 39 lbs of torque.  The engine 
was a dual-overhead-cam with Bosch fuel injection.  There were 
several other small conviences added with only approx. 90 lbs 
additional weight.

'86 added anti-lock brakes 

'87 was the big year with the introduction of the S4. The engine was 
tweaked a little more to give an extra 28 hp, bringing the grand 
total up to 316 w/317 torque.  In addition there were several 
"major" styling changes which, IMHO, really ready the 928 for the 
90s and make an already good looking car even more so.  

'88 and '89 show no significant improvements over the '87 S4 but 
seem to cost much more in proportion to what you get. 

The '85s and '86s seem to be (relitivly) plentiful and cheap here in 
Atlanta, but I would reccomend holding out for an '87 if you have 
the time.

Happy Hunting

As there's a discussion regarding spark plugs I have to give some
information regarding the difficulty to buy a spark plug.

Performance Products catalogue recommends Bosch W5D Super or NGK BG7ES
for a 1980-83 911SC. Aha. NGK BG7ES can be bought at a low cost car parts 
store for 1$ compared to 3.75$ for the Bosch plugs when you buy them
from the Porsche dealer. 

As the recommendation is for American cars I called NGK Sweden up and asked
them what they recommended for my car. The ONLY plug NGK recommends is
B8EV (gold - palladium) with the nice price 17,50$ - each. 

I have just ordered Bosch W3CC from Porsche for 3.75$.

The moral of the story is that if you have a European 911 your engine
might need other plugs than the American 911's.

a track event or two.

I have not seen this topic discussed in this list. If it was,
and is in a FAQ, could someone please send it?

I am using Repco, but they boiled my brakes the only
time I had them on the track, and the coefficient of
friction is not high enough for my non-assisted brakes for
autocrossing.

I will choose from Cool Carbon, Performance Friction, 
Carbon Kevlar (?),  and the ones sold by Automotion,
Tweeks, etc. Any others worth trying, how about Ferodos?
I have heard various stories about problems with the available
Carbon based pads. Also some have different compounds
available. Which have worked well?

I will be glad to collect all opinions on these pads and come
up with the general consensus.

Also, please advise on different break-in procedures. Some
require new rotors and bedding in, etc.

Jim, I've never used Bosch plugs before, so pardon my ignorance.  Are the 
Al washers supplied with the plug?  If so, where does one get spare 
washers, or are these easily available?

Subject: Tyres

Thanks to Lee of Washington for the information on
tyres from the Auto Motor und Sport magazine.
As for the performance of the Yokos I have the
following observations.
I replaced P600s in 215/60 ZR15 size with A-008Ps
and found them a large improvement especially in
terms of grip. The only disadvantage was a very
high wear rate, about 8000 miles for the rears
for instance and I'm not a hard driver. The Yokos
were a much newer tyre design than the P600s.
My current 944 has 205/55 and 225/50 ZR16 combination
with Dunlop D40 Mk2s. These were the bees knees in
England 3 years ago, now Dunlop make the SP8000s
and only still sell the D40 Mk2s for customers who
want cheap(ish) tyres.
  All this points to what the tyre companys have
being saying. They claim tyre design used to be
some science and a lot of art, these days it's
mainly science with some art. It does seem tyre's
are improving at an unprecedented rate and the 
A-008Ps are mearly suffering from being an "old"
design.
  I don't think this matters to most of us, I
drive around on obsolete Dunlops and I think the
resulting handling is brilliant. However I must
admit that my next set of tyres will be the best I
can get regardless of cost. So finally as I am 
looking forward to buying a new set of tyres fairly
soon has anyone had experience of Continentals
AquaContact?

It might be worth rembering that the show car Boxster
had a level of detailing we won't get from a "cheap"
car. So far on the right hand side of the Atlantic
there is a rumour the wheelbase has been stretched
to make it a 2+2 but this hasn't had much comment
from inside sources. What does seem to be confirmed
by these same sources is the nose, boot, has be
enlarged in order to meet crash regulations. Prices
aimed at are 25-30k pounds sterling for a flat four
engine and the flat six with 200bhp will be a lot
more. Oh and the 1996 launch date may well turn into
1997 if past performances are to go by.
  I spoke to a dealer about deposits and they said
1,000 pounds with a no penalty withdrawal if I don't
like the car or the price. When I hummed they brought
the deposit down to 250 pounds. Goodness knows what
I could have achieved if I'd haggled!
  Despite the warning that the real car will not be
as drop dead gorgeous as the show car I may well put
my name on the list and learn how to rob banks to
get the funds needed.

Kevin & Kevin

Read some time ago about the merits of silicon fluid - this is a summary 
of what I remember.

The traditional glycol based fluids have an affinity for water, typically 
they have a lower boiling point than silicon based, and a far lower 
boiling point when contaminated with water.

From this it is clear that you are far less likely to get brake failure 
caused by vapourisation with silicon.

There may be some issues about silicon fluid attacking the rubber in the 
cylinders, but I cannot remember any details ( I don't think this is a 
problem).

The big problem with silicon fluid is the fire risk.

Silicon fluid is far more likely to catch fire than gasoline. 
If you drip gas onto a hot exhaust, it will vaporise, but will only catch
fire if there is a naked light or spark around. 
If you drop silicon on the exhaust, it ignites without any inducement.

A high proportion of engine fires on modern cars are brake fluid induced, 
a typical scenario is a frontal collision where the fluid res gets 
smashed or dislodged ( you know the stupid wobbly ptastic box on top of 
the servo) the contents then fall straight on to the hot exhaust..

Luckily 944's have the servo on the cold side of the bay.

All this talk about warping rotors has got me thinking.

As I have previously mentioned I'm prepping the car now for at least
on drivers ed this spring (at Mid-Ohio).

Should I consider putting on cool carbons or some other "race" brake
pads for the event ?  If I don't, will I stand a good chance of warping
rotors ?  A set of pads is certainly cheaper than the rotors !

Subject: 944 gas gauge woes

Here's one for the 944 experts...

My 85.1 944 fuel gauge is acting up. If I fill up, the gauge never registers
all the way to full. It stops about an 1/4" from the full mark.

On the way down, it will register up to a point, about a little past the
1/4 line and then buries itself into the left. All the way!

I have cleaned the battery cables (ground) and the 3 wires comming out of the
+ terminal. I first thought it was a voltage or missing ground problem. But
all other instruments work ok.

I've taken the tank sender apart and made sure the little spring contacts were 
making good contact with the sensing wires. Also checked the reserve light
contact. An ohm-meter shows about 75 ohms at the lowest sender level (empty
tank) and about 4 ohms at the highest (full tank). 

This makes sense since low resistance (full tank) means more current = more
deflection on the gas gauge.

It appears to me that the whole operating range should be shifted right.
It looks like the sender is not adjustable. 

Does any one know if there is any kind of adjustment in the back of the
fuel gauge. Something like a trim pot? I figured that if there is one, I could
fill up, drive home, take the inst cluster apart and adjust the trimmer pot
to show a full tank...

Comments?

I just set my engine directly on my work bench.  A cheap, build-it-yourself

3" decking screws not the silly little nails that came with it.

The bench creaked a little but no problem, solid.  The engine is pretty

of 2x4 and little pieces of 1/2" trim as wedges to block the thing

Wasn't the show-car 'inoperable' up front, i.e. the wheels could not be
fully turned due to constrictions in the front fenders?  Could this also
be the reason for the redesigned front end?  Out of curiosity, how many
are putting up the deposit, and what is the projected price these days?

Yep, that's the factory alarm.  You should have a long skinny key that fits
into it.  They honk the horn if anyone opens the doors (and maybe hood) while
the alarm is active.  They also cut off an ignition component (fuel pump relay?)
so noone can drive away with the horn honking.

I'd still spring for a different alarm, though.  I would think it would be
pretty easy to pry open the keyhole and somehow disable the alarm from there.
Also, my insurance company won't give me an alarm discount because the alarm
doesn't passively arm itself.  Plus, with aftermarket alarms you can get cool
toys like interfaces to the sunroof, windows and rear hatch.  I'm hoping to
install a new stereo system in my 944S this summer, and you can bet I'm going to
install a new alarm then, too.

Subject: Over-reving on a 1980 911SC

I've developed a problem with over-reving on my 1980 911SC AFTER the 
engine has completely warmed up. i.e. this is not a cold engine problem. 
Specifically, after driving on the highway for 20 minutes the engine 
idles at over 2000 RPM.  When cold, the engine idles at a more reasonable 
1200 RPM.

When I purchased the car I found that the previous ouwner had 
disconnected the hose that connect to a vacumen type device on the right 
side of the engine.  I can't remember the name of this device but it 
serves to maintain revs after foot is removed from the accelerator.  
Consequently, it was very difficult to shift without clunking the engine.

I reconnected the hose and obtained much smoother shifting.  A month or 
so later the problem with over-reving emerged.  I don't think the two are 
definitely related, especially after re-disconnecting the hose and 
finding that the problem didn't go away.

So, any ideas?

My local mechanic thinks the most likely problem is that the vacume 
device I referred to earlier is worn out.  What does the net think?

How difficult would it be to replace this device if necessary?

The car is in storage this winter, but come spring I'll be very 
interested in fixing the problem.

Also I know for a fact that Discount Auto Parts takes used oil for free. They
don't take oil filters though. The Jiffy lube where I live, Gainesville,

Blaine,

        Just happens we (San Diego region) had a Tech at the dealer 
(Pioneer) last night.  Pioneer said the Boxters will be allocated to dealers 
based upon past sales figures for the dealers.  this is a change from past 
policy when cars were allocated based upon the number of deposits received.  
I guess under the old system, some dealers took large numbers of deposits to 
increase their alotment size, resulting in many frustrated would-be 
customers. Pioneer anticipates getting about 200 Boxters in the first year.  
They have quit taking deposits, and did not specify how many deposits they 
have, but did say "it was getting rediculous".

        The price is still pegged at "under $40k", although if the first 
years production is fully subscribed, we all know what that will do in the 
marketplace.

Likely the control pressure regulator, and that is also the most likely 
cause of your problem -- but for a different reason. It's also known as
the 'warmup regulator'....

I think you need to replace your mechanic with someone that actually

"Normal hand tools, simple bolt-on procedure." It's just that getting
the control pressures re-adjusted is a bit tricky unless you have the
special tools and experience.

Kyle Ehler mentions a "nib file." This is basically a short piece of mill
bastard file, maybe with a gentler grind on the curved teeth, mounted in a
small piece of wood. I think they take off too much paint for the usual dust
inclusions (it's basicaly a "paint shaver") but I use them on the occasional

Tom,

Yes, the bad news is you have the wrong pistons and they won't work with your
motor very well, if at all.  

Your supplier has sent you the special 2.7 RS pistons that work with MFI.
 Usually, these cost more than the standard pistons and are desired by folks
converting to carberators or upgrading their 2.4's to 2.7's.

These RS pistons fit the 911.83 engine made from '73 to '76.  You will have
to return them or sell them to someone.  What did you pay for them?

Subject: I just bought 912E VIN#1 !!! shocks?

Hello Porschephiliacs,  Yesterday I picked up 912E #9126000001 for $6200! I 
checked the number in the trunk and it matched the window #.  The engine is 
#P*000003, so I figured they must have kept the first two for testing.  
As I drove away from the notary's office, the previous owner stopped 
me and told me to take good care of his baby (better than he did 
anyway).  I then asked him if he knew if the car was special in any way.  
He said no, so I showed him the VIN on the title he just signed over and 
pointed to the "1"  He looked with surprise as I gave him a big grin :^) 
and drove off.  Am I mean or what?  Anyway I looked through the records 
and got the idea that NOTHING has ever been replaced in this car's 66,000 
miles!  Especially bad are the shocks, can I use 911 shocks and who makes 
the best ones for a firm ride?  I adjusted the slipping clutch and gave 
it thicker 20W50 oil.  Now it only smokes at startup and deceleration, 
and the clutch slips at 4000RPM instead of 3000.  I hope it lasts a 
little while or I'll have to sell my beloved '77 924 to pay for parts :^( .

Subject: Tyres

Thanks to Lee of Washington for the information on
tyres from the Auto Motor und Sport magazine.
As for the performance of the Yokos I have the
following observations.
I replaced P600s in 215/60 ZR15 size with A-008Ps
and found them a large improvement especially in
terms of grip. The only disadvantage was a very
high wear rate, about 8000 miles for the rears
for instance and I'm not a hard driver. The Yokos
were a much newer tyre design than the P600s.
My current 944 has 205/55 and 225/50 ZR16 combination
with Dunlop D40 Mk2s. These were the bees knees in
England 3 years ago, now Dunlop make the SP8000s
and only still sell the D40 Mk2s for customers who
want cheap(ish) tyres.
  All this points to what the tyre companys have
being saying. They claim tyre design used to be
some science and a lot of art, these days it's
mainly science with some art. It does seem tyre's
are improving at an unprecedented rate and the 
A-008Ps are mearly suffering from being an "old"
design.
  I don't think this matters to most of us, I
drive around on obsolete Dunlops and I think the
resulting handling is brilliant. However I must
admit that my next set of tyres will be the best I
can get regardless of cost. So finally as I am 
looking forward to buying a new set of tyres fairly
soon has anyone had experience of Continentals
AquaContact?

It might be worth rembering that the show car Boxster
had a level of detailing we won't get from a "cheap"
car. So far on the right hand side of the Atlantic
there is a rumour the wheelbase has been stretched
to make it a 2+2 but this hasn't had much comment
from inside sources. What does seem to be confirmed
by these same sources is the nose, boot, has be
enlarged in order to meet crash regulations. Prices
aimed at are 25-30k pounds sterling for a flat four
engine and the flat six with 200bhp will be a lot
more. Oh and the 1996 launch date may well turn into
1997 if past performances are to go by.
  I spoke to a dealer about deposits and they said
1,000 pounds with a no penalty withdrawal if I don't
like the car or the price. When I hummed they brought
the deposit down to 250 pounds. Goodness knows what
I could have achieved if I'd haggled!
  Despite the warning that the real car will not be

Kevin & Kevin

Read some time ago about the merits of silicon fluid - this is a summary 
of what I remember.

The traditional glycol based fluids have an affinity for water, typically 
they have a lower boiling point than silicon based, and a far lower 
boiling point when contaminated with water.

From this it is clear that you are far less likely to get brake failure 
caused by vapourisation with silicon.

There may be some issues about silicon fluid attacking the rubber in the 
cylinders, but I cannot remember any details ( I don't think this is a 
problem).

The big problem with silicon fluid is the fire risk.

Silicon fluid is far more likely to catch fire than gasoline. 
If you drip gas onto a hot exhaust, it will vaporise, but will only catch
fire if there is a naked light or spark around. 
If you drop silicon on the exhaust, it ignites without any inducement.

A high proportion of engine fires on modern cars are brake fluid induced, 
a typical scenario is a frontal collision where the fluid res gets 
smashed or dislodged ( you know the stupid wobbly ptastic box on top of 
the servo) the contents then fall straight on to the hot exhaust..

Luckily 944's have the servo on the cold side of the bay.

Subject: 944 gas gauge woes

Here's one for the 944 experts...

My 85.1 944 fuel gauge is acting up. If I fill up, the gauge never registers
all the way to full. It stops about an 1/4" from the full mark.

On the way down, it will register up to a point, about a little past the
1/4 line and then buries itself into the left. All the way!

I have cleaned the battery cables (ground) and the 3 wires comming out of the
+ terminal. I first thought it was a voltage or missing ground problem. But
all other instruments work ok.

I've taken the tank sender apart and made sure the little spring contacts were 
making good contact with the sensing wires. Also checked the reserve light
contact. An ohm-meter shows about 75 ohms at the lowest sender level (empty
tank) and about 4 ohms at the highest (full tank). 

This makes sense since low resistance (full tank) means more current = more
deflection on the gas gauge.

It appears to me that the whole operating range should be shifted right.
It looks like the sender is not adjustable. 

Does any one know if there is any kind of adjustment in the back of the
fuel gauge. Something like a trim pot? I figured that if there is one, I could
fill up, drive home, take the inst cluster apart and adjust the trimmer pot
to show a full tank...

Comments?

I just set my engine directly on my work bench.  A cheap, build-it-yourself
one I got from Furrows for the purpose, however I did assemble it with
3" decking screws not the silly little nails that came with it.

The bench creaked a little but no problem, solid.  The engine is pretty
light, probably 250lbs or so with the cis on it.  I used little blocks
of 2x4 and little pieces of 1/2" trim as wedges to block the thing
solidly into various positions.

Wasn't the show-car 'inoperable' up front, i.e. the wheels could not be

he wasn't sure what he was doing here (and also he was in some academic

his jobs was a stint at a Jiffy-Lube and he was telling me about the
incompetence of some of the people who worked there...  When I told him
I had a 914, he immediately related the story of when a coworker was
told to give an oil change/checkup to an old bug - apparently he was
found testing the percentage of ethylene glycol in the oil-bath air
cleaner.  Just another reason to do your own maintenance...

	Does anyone know if porsches, specifically 944 turbos, came with factory

	someone said this was a factory installed alarm. I am so concerned about this
	because my car was broken into, and I was considering purchasing an alarm,

Yep, that's the factory alarm.  You should have a long skinny key that fits
into it.  They honk the horn if anyone opens the doors (and maybe hood) while
the alarm is active.  They also cut off an ignition component (fuel pump relay?)
so noone can drive away with the horn honking.

I'd still spring for a different alarm, though.  I would think it would be
pretty easy to pry open the keyhole and somehow disable the alarm from there.
Also, my insurance company won't give me an alarm discount because the alarm
doesn't passively arm itself.  Plus, with aftermarket alarms you can get cool
toys like interfaces to the sunroof, windows and rear hatch.  I'm hoping to
install a new stereo system in my 944S this summer, and you can bet I'm going to
install a new alarm then, too.

Subject: Over-reving on a 1980 911SC

I've developed a problem with over-reving on my 1980 911SC AFTER the 
engine has completely warmed up. i.e. this is not a cold engine problem. 
Specifically, after driving on the highway for 20 minutes the engine 
idles at over 2000 RPM.  When cold, the engine idles at a more reasonable 
1200 RPM.

When I purchased the car I found that the previous ouwner had 
disconnected the hose that connect to a vacumen type device on the right 
side of the engine.  I can't remember the name of this device but it 
serves to maintain revs after foot is removed from the accelerator.  
Consequently, it was very difficult to shift without clunking the engine.

I reconnected the hose and obtained much smoother shifting.  A month or 
so later the problem with over-reving emerged.  I don't think the two are 
definitely related, especially after re-disconnecting the hose and 
finding that the problem didn't go away.

So, any ideas?

My local mechanic thinks the most likely problem is that the vacume 
device I referred to earlier is worn out.  What does the net think?

How difficult would it be to replace this device if necessary?

The car is in storage this winter, but come spring I'll be very 
interested in fixing the problem.

Also I know for a fact that Discount Auto Parts takes used oil for free. They
don't take oil filters though. The Jiffy lube where I live, Gainesville, 
FL, accepts oil filters. Anything is better than dumping it on the ground.

Blaine,

        Just happens we (San Diego region) had a Tech at the dealer 
(Pioneer) last night.  Pioneer said the Boxters will be allocated to dealers 
based upon past sales figures for the dealers.  this is a change from past 
policy when cars were allocated based upon the number of deposits received.  
I guess under the old system, some dealers took large numbers of deposits to 
increase their alotment size, resulting in many frustrated would-be 
customers. Pioneer anticipates getting about 200 Boxters in the first year.  
They have quit taking deposits, and did not specify how many deposits they 
have, but did say "it was getting rediculous".

        The price is still pegged at "under $40k", although if the first 
years production is fully subscribed, we all know what that will do in the 
marketplace.

Likely the control pressure regulator, and that is also the most likely 
cause of your problem -- but for a different reason. It's also known as
the 'warmup regulator'....

I think you need to replace your mechanic with someone that actually 
understands CIS.

"Normal hand tools, simple bolt-on procedure." It's just that getting
the control pressures re-adjusted is a bit tricky unless you have the
special tools and experience.

Tom,

Yes, the bad news is you have the wrong pistons and they won't work with your
motor very well, if at all.  

Your supplier has sent you the special 2.7 RS pistons that work with MFI.
 Usually, these cost more than the standard pistons and are desired by folks
converting to carberators or upgrading their 2.4's to 2.7's.

These RS pistons fit the 911.83 engine made from '73 to '76.  You will have
to return them or sell them to someone.  What did you pay for them?

Here's my oil disposal timeline (in a vertical format):

1) oil gets dumped on the ground and in sewers
2) environment gets damaged by oil
3) oil is classified hazardous by EPA (USA)
4) disposal is regulated; new businesses pop up to charge for its disposal
5) free disposal methods disappear, nobody's willing to take your oil any more

Hello Porschephiliacs,  Yesterday I picked up 912E #9126000001 for $6200! I 
checked the number in the trunk and it matched the window #.  The engine is 
#P*000003, so I figured they must have kept the first two for testing.  
As I drove away from the notary's office, the previous owner stopped 
me and told me to take good care of his baby (better than he did 
anyway).  I then asked him if he knew if the car was special in any way.  
He said no, so I showed him the VIN on the title he just signed over and 
pointed to the "1"  He looked with surprise as I gave him a big grin :^) 
and drove off.  Am I mean or what?  Anyway I looked through the records 
and got the idea that NOTHING has ever been replaced in this car's 66,000 
miles!  Especially bad are the shocks, can I use 911 shocks and who makes 
the best ones for a firm ride?  I adjusted the slipping clutch and gave 
it thicker 20W50 oil.  Now it only smokes at startup and deceleration, 
and the clutch slips at 4000RPM instead of 3000.  I hope it lasts a 
little while or I'll have to sell my beloved '77 924 to pay for parts :^( .

I don't mail to the list much as there are *many* people on this list that can

say I have not had any problems with the car in the 2+ years I have owned it.

My GTS is a 5 speed and has seen the track at Vegas twice and run in 20+

there really isn't that many in the US. I know from talking to the regional rep

Hi P-philers:

I am (still) rebuilding an original 73 911 RS engine.  My current decision is on 
the oil pump: should I rebuild the original pump or upgrade to a newer Carrera 
version?  I believe the original has a magnesium body (like the engine case) and 
the Carrera version is aluminum and may have a higher flow rate and output 
pressure.  I also believe the Carrera version will fit unmodified.

Any comments would be appreciated.

Perhaps I did not make my questions too specific or clear enough for people to understand. 
Am I not following the right protocol?

How much would I expect to pay for major services for this car?

Hello PorschePhiles,

I need some advice, I have been actively looking at buying an '85-'87 911 Carrera Coupe, 
so far I've not found anything interesting...

Well, I just returned to my office after test driving an '89 911 Coupe. This car was
advertised in the paper for $20.9K, yes $20,900. So of course I flew to this place to take a
look and to test drive it. The car has 90k miles, it is extremely clean in/out and it is a 
one-owner car.  I could not verify/review any of the maintenance & service records.  Needless 
to say, I will have the car inspected by the Porsche mechanic who works on my '88 944.

But for now my concern is of course the mileage on the car, 90,000 miles. What do you 911 
owners think about this, should I stay away from this car? I don't know much about this 
particular model year. Is there anything peculiar about this MY Carrera? I've been reading 
some recent posts about '87 Carreras having problems with temperature senders. Are there 
any common problems related to the '89 Carreras? Any comments about maintenance costs?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: Quaife Installation

Next week I'm planning on having a quaife limited slip put into my '72 911 
and I have been getting conflicting info on what needs to be done.  The 
transmission is the early 915 type.  

On one hand I've heard that all you need is the early 915 course spline 
quaife and a spacer and then the quaife should go right in.

On the other hand I've heard that you need the 901 quaife, which fits in the 
915 transmission, and then cut your stub axles by 4mm.

Can anyone confirm what needs to be done here?  I've concerned that I'll get 
poor handling or damage some parts if this is not done correctly.

Thanks,

Stan, if it's on the right-hand side, wouldn't it be the auxiliary air
regulator?  The 'warmup regulator' which modulates the fuel input, is on
the left-hand (driver's) side, just below the heater blower motor and
assembly.  The auxiliary air regulator is just behind the oil filter,
above the valve cover I think.  Of course, it contributes to the warmup
behavior as well, as it modulates the air flow.  I always hear of the fuel
regulator (warmup regulator) beging replaced, how come this aux. air unit
rarely gets mentioned?  Do they not go bad as easily?  I was thinking
maybe it was disconnected as a 'cheap fix' by the previous owner, though
I'm not sure which hose was disconnected.  Perhaps if it's the 'output'
hose, and that regulator IS working, the car was adjusted with regulator
out of the loop, so that now it's back in, the settings are off.

Hello Porschephiliacs,  Yesterday I picked up 912E #9126000001 for $6200! I 
checked the number in the trunk and it matched the window #.  The engine is 
#P*000003, so I figured they must have kept the first two for testing.  
As I drove away from the notary's office, the previous owner stopped 
me and told me to take good care of his baby (better than he did 
anyway).  I then asked him if he knew if the car was special in any way.  
He said no, so I showed him the VIN on the title he just signed over and 
pointed to the "1"  He looked with surprise as I gave him a big grin :^) 
and drove off.  Am I mean or what?  Anyway I looked through the records 
and got the idea that NOTHING has ever been replaced in this car's 66,000 
miles!  Especially bad are the shocks, can I use 911 shocks and who makes 
the best ones for a firm ride?  I adjusted the slipping clutch and gave 
it thicker 20W50 oil.  Now it only smokes at startup and deceleration, 
and the clutch slips at 4000RPM instead of 3000.  I hope it lasts a 
little while or I'll have to sell my beloved '77 924 to pay for parts :^( . 
This car is very fun to drive and I have to thank all those on P-philes 
who gave me enogh info to give me the nerve to buy it!

        Naah.  The 914.  Ugly/pretty.  Still can't make up
my mind, and I still like it for that.  (Among other things)
        And the ultimate reason that the 914/4 is the "best"

of the whole crowd!  The /6 may have an equally long one, but
it's quite a bit tighter, from what I hear.  [BIG HORDE OF

Several people have asked for a recommend shop that does pre-purchase

D&M Motors in Palo Alto has done an excellent job of servicing my cars for 
several years now and I know they do pre-purchase inspections. 
 
While I have not had them do a pre-purchase inspection for me, I just happened 
to be hanging around the shop on two different occasions when they reported 
out  to the sellers and prospective buyers (a 930 and a 928).  In both cases, 
both seller and buyer seemed very satisfied with the information provided. 
 
D&M can be reached at (415) 329-9016.   
 
I suggest that you ask to have Dieter Mees (the owner) do the inspection.

need to be replaced.  Last I read (from a _European Car_ article
a while back) I was supposed to use the "latest Viton O-rings".
Is this still true?  How do the seals that the dealer sells
compare to these?  Are they the same thing?
        Just trying to get my act together before I get my order
together!

        If you're removing both engine and transmission together,
simply putting the jack under the engine bar would *not* balance
the two.  When I got my engine out yesterday, I put it up on
blocks, using the mounting bar to support the engine.  I very
definitely needed the floor jack on the transmission side to
everything in the air.
        I'm not sure about only removing the engine.  It may be
that it balances with the tranny and headers (etc.) off the en-
engine, but the bar is rather far forward.  I kinda doubt it.
        Then again, I've only done two, and George has probably
done 200+...
        Another option, instead of trying to balance on one jack,
is to use two.  That was how Josh and I did it the first time.
Coordinating two jacks is very definitely a two-person operation.

Whatever you do, DON'T sell it to a collector!!  Keep it.  Fix it.  Insure the
hell out of it and drive it.  Most collectors will keep them locked away until
they can make money on it and then sell it to someone who'll keep it in their
garage, protecting it but never letting it see the pavement again.

Don't sell to ANY collector!!  They're ALL speculators and most will sell it
to the highest bidder in a New York minute.

Drive it!!  Send pictures to your friends!!!  Keep it forever!!!  It is now

        Picked up a copy of the _Diablo Dealer_ at the grocery
store yesterday.  It's one of the local (SF Bay Area) freebie
car ad papers.  Saw two or three 928s in there.  One was adver-
tised as a 928 S 32-valver with 5-sp.  No price listed, natch!
        So there are *some* out there for sale with the manual
trannies.
        One of the reasons that the automatics were so popular
was the 5-speeds on the early cars.  From reading reviews in
the car mags of the time, it seems that people were *very* un-
impressed by the shifting of the early 928.  They were all re-
commending that people buy the automatics instead.  Evidently
Porsche fixed the problem after a couple of years, because I
saw a later review which said the manual was now even better
than the slushbox.

I generally do not re-use sparkplugs. Some autoparts stores or speed

come with washers unless they are the tapered seat type like Ford and

Just use the range recommended in your owner's manual or the direct

use it to induce oversteer (especially in snow/ice or rain).  I only do 
this in places with safe amounts of room for error.  My father said that 
this causes very serious damage to the car (a front wheel drive Jetta GLI 
16V) and that the car never runs right after these manuevers (I didn't

Is his assertation true?  Does use of the parking brake cause damage to 
the car/tires or whatever?

Also, are parking brakes always attached to the rear wheels?

Hi, Justin,

Never caused a problem with any car that I ever did it with...And I have
driven quite a few.

Rabbits and Jettas and Audis all respond well to this kind of treatment, but
you will accelerate the wear on the rear brake shoes (or discs), but that is
minor compared to the fun you have... :-)

The only car that I have encountered that works the parking brake on the
front wheels is the SAAB (read: weird Swedish car, made by trolls who have
never seen a german car...)

BTW, I used to go to that school (Gonzaga)... When I was there, I was called
a COG-rat...that thing still there???

Subject: short shifters, cats, and killer paint



The '73 and later shift tower is a big improvement over the 
earlier model. Joe Reid, our NNJR tech guru says that the
short shift kits for a 915 transmission are a waste of time
for two reasons - it's only going to shift as fast as the 
already weak synchros will allow, and the extra mechanical
effort required is a pain makes it tough to downshift into 
lower gears when the synchros inevitably get weak. 

It *does* reduce the physical distance between shifts, which 
I always thought to be out of character in a sports car.

My stock '81 SC has over 1,000 track miles on the same rotors.
(I have used MetalMaster pads.)  You almost certainly will boil the
brake fluid though.  When the brakes cool off you will have a very
soft pedal.  On the warmup lap always test the brakes before you
reach the first corner.  Getting the brakes warm again will firm the
pedal back up and the brakes will work fine.  Be careful on the way
home because you won't have a chance to get the brakes warmed up
before you need them in a panic stop.  Bleeding the brake fluid after
the event will get everything back to normal.

This has been my consistent experience.  It hasn't been a problem on
the race track just on the way home.  A way to reduce the severity
of the problem is to brake a couple of car lengths sooner and just a
little easier.  Some people use a brake duct called "Cool Brake"
which attaches to the front brakes.  These get more air to the front
brakes and keep them cooler.

Even if you do absolutely nothing to your car, a stock SC will do
quite nicely at drivers ed.

Sheesh, right, left, what's the difference? Well, when you've only had about
3 hours of sleep in the preceeding day and a half, the answer is "not much".
You are right, errr, "correct"...

> how come this aux. air unit
> rarely gets mentioned?  Do they not go bad as easily?  

Because they get overlooked? I've had them go bad with some frequency.
Ever look inside one? There's a rotating disk with hole in it. The
disk shuts off air flow from side to side, or permits airflow through
some portion of the little hole depending on where it is in the rotation
cycle. The size and shape of the hole vary wildly with the application, 
depending on the operational needs of the engine. The function is to let
unmetered air into the intake system, which raises the idle. As the engine
warms up, the hole rotates away from the passage and no air flows -- i.e.
only metered air is let into the engine. 

Failure of this gizmo causes the car not to run very well when cold. If
it sticks open, the car runs great when cold but runs lean when warm due
to the extra air bypassing the metering system.

And if you put the wrong unit on your car because you can no longer get
the right unit due to parts supercession, the car just doesn't run as
well. I know this to be a problem with Euro models... Had to do surgery
on a perfectly good aux air unit to change the hole size.

  So I want to know these prices in the U.S.(sorry, I dont know these parts
  number...) and import some to JAPAN because especially rear 8J wheel is 
  too nallow for tire size(255/40-17) and the whole balance of the car with 
  wide wheel is shapely. Genuin parts price in JAPAN is too expensive for 
  me and I know from some information that these price in U.S. is reasonable.
  If shipping is very low cost, I can buy it for reasonable price.

  Any information(parts price, shop recommendation etc.) I appreciate.

  Thanks in advance,

WHAT!!!!  You pour it on your driveway?  Do you know what happens to that

Where do you live that you are allowed to dump waste oil like that?  In 
California, you'd get busted for illegal dumping of hazardous waste. 
 Recycle it.

Even using oil as chainsaw lube is becoming environmentally incorrect.  I 
saw some info about the amount of saw oil dispersed in  forests by loggers 
and us home-type woodcutters. Just by the splatter.  It's enough that new 
lubricants have been developed that are environmentally/loggerly friendly.

Evaporate the brake fluid if you can't find anyone to take it.

(Stepping off soapbox)

It would be a bummer if your P-car ended up over the cliff, however.

I'm not an owner, but the specs call for DOT 4 - 200 brake fluid. This is a
new type which has higher wet boiling point than the usual DOT 4 and is less
hygroscopic. Because of this, Porsche increased the recommended brake fluid
change interval from 2 up to 3 years.

Hello Porschephiliacs,  Yesterday I picked up 912E #9126000001 for $6200! I 
checked the number in the trunk and it matched the window #.  The engine is 
#P*000003, so I figured they must have kept the first two for testing.  
As I drove away from the notary's office, the previous owner stopped 
me and told me to take good care of his baby (better than he did 
anyway).  I then asked him if he knew if the car was special in any way.  
He said no, so I showed him the VIN on the title he just signed over and 
pointed to the "1"  He looked with surprise as I gave him a big grin :^) 
and drove off.  Am I mean or what?  Anyway I looked through the records 
and got the idea that NOTHING has ever been replaced in this car's 66,000 
miles!  Especially bad are the shocks, can I use 911 shocks and who makes 
the best ones for a firm ride?  I adjusted the slipping clutch and gave 
it thicker 20W50 oil.  Now it only smokes at startup and deceleration, 
and the clutch slips at 4000RPM instead of 3000.  I hope it lasts a 
little while or I'll have to sell my beloved '77 924 to pay for parts :^( . 
This car is very fun to drive and I have to thank all those on P-philes

        Naah.  The 914.  Ugly/pretty.  Still can't make up
my mind, and I still like it for that.  (Among other things)
        And the ultimate reason that the 914/4 is the "best"

of the whole crowd!  The /6 may have an equally long one, but
it's quite a bit tighter, from what I hear.  [BIG HORDE OF

Several people have asked for a recommend shop that does pre-purchase 
inspections in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
 
D&M Motors in Palo Alto has done an excellent job of servicing my cars for 
several years now and I know they do pre-purchase inspections. 
 
While I have not had them do a pre-purchase inspection for me, I just happened 
to be hanging around the shop on two different occasions when they reported 
out  to the sellers and prospective buyers (a 930 and a 928).  In both cases, 
both seller and buyer seemed very satisfied with the information provided. 
 
D&M can be reached at (415) 329-9016.   
 
I suggest that you ask to have Dieter Mees (the owner) do the inspection.

        If you're removing both engine and transmission together,
simply putting the jack under the engine bar would *not* balance
the two.  When I got my engine out yesterday, I put it up on
blocks, using the mounting bar to support the engine.  I very
definitely needed the floor jack on the transmission side to
everything in the air.
        I'm not sure about only removing the engine.  It may be
that it balances with the tranny and headers (etc.) off the en-
engine, but the bar is rather far forward.  I kinda doubt it.
        Then again, I've only done two, and George has probably
done 200+...
        Another option, instead of trying to balance on one jack,
is to use two.  That was how Josh and I did it the first time.
Coordinating two jacks is very definitely a two-person operation.

they can make money on it and then sell it to someone who'll keep it in their

Don't sell to ANY collector!!  They're ALL speculators and most will sell it

Subject: Bay Area 928's

        Picked up a copy of the _Diablo Dealer_ at the grocery
store yesterday.  It's one of the local (SF Bay Area) freebie
car ad papers.  Saw two or three 928s in there.  One was adver-
tised as a 928 S 32-valver with 5-sp.  No price listed, natch!
        So there are *some* out there for sale with the manual
trannies.
        One of the reasons that the automatics were so popular
was the 5-speeds on the early cars.  From reading reviews in
the car mags of the time, it seems that people were *very* un-
impressed by the shifting of the early 928.  They were all re-
commending that people buy the automatics instead.  Evidently
Porsche fixed the problem after a couple of years, because I
saw a later review which said the manual was now even better
than the slushbox.

I generally do not re-use sparkplugs. Some autoparts stores or speed

come with washers unless they are the tapered seat type like Ford and

Just use the range recommended in your owner's manual or the direct

	I have a question about the use of my parking brake.  It is fun to 
use it to induce oversteer (especially in snow/ice or rain).  I only do 
this in places with safe amounts of room for error.  My father said that 
this causes very serious damage to the car (a front wheel drive Jetta GLI 
16V) and that the car never runs right after these manuevers (I didn't

Is his assertation true?  Does use of the parking brake cause damage to 
the car/tires or whatever?

Also, are parking brakes always attached to the rear wheels?

Hi, Justin,

Never caused a problem with any car that I ever did it with...And I have
driven quite a few.

Rabbits and Jettas and Audis all respond well to this kind of treatment, but
you will accelerate the wear on the rear brake shoes (or discs), but that is
minor compared to the fun you have... :-)

The only car that I have encountered that works the parking brake on the
front wheels is the SAAB (read: weird Swedish car, made by trolls who have
never seen a german car...)

BTW, I used to go to that school (Gonzaga)... When I was there, I was called
a COG-rat...that thing still there???

Subject: short shifters, cats, and killer paint



The '73 and later shift tower is a big improvement over the 
earlier model. Joe Reid, our NNJR tech guru says that the
short shift kits for a 915 transmission are a waste of time
for two reasons - it's only going to shift as fast as the 
already weak synchros will allow, and the extra mechanical
effort required is a pain makes it tough to downshift into 
lower gears when the synchros inevitably get weak. 

It *does* reduce the physical distance between shifts, which 
I always thought to be out of character in a sports car.

My stock '81 SC has over 1,000 track miles on the same rotors.
(I have used MetalMaster pads.)  You almost certainly will boil the
brake fluid though.  When the brakes cool off you will have a very
soft pedal.  On the warmup lap always test the brakes before you
reach the first corner.  Getting the brakes warm again will firm the
pedal back up and the brakes will work fine.  Be careful on the way
home because you won't have a chance to get the brakes warmed up
before you need them in a panic stop.  Bleeding the brake fluid after
the event will get everything back to normal.

This has been my consistent experience.  It hasn't been a problem on
the race track just on the way home.  A way to reduce the severity
of the problem is to brake a couple of car lengths sooner and just a
little easier.  Some people use a brake duct called "Cool Brake"
which attaches to the front brakes.  These get more air to the front
brakes and keep them cooler.

Even if you do absolutely nothing to your car, a stock SC will do
quite nicely at drivers ed.

Sheesh, right, left, what's the difference? Well, when you've only had about
3 hours of sleep in the preceeding day and a half, the answer is "not much".
You are right, errr, "correct"...

> how come this aux. air unit
> rarely gets mentioned?  Do they not go bad as easily?  

Because they get overlooked? I've had them go bad with some frequency.
Ever look inside one? There's a rotating disk with hole in it. The
disk shuts off air flow from side to side, or permits airflow through
some portion of the little hole depending on where it is in the rotation
cycle. The size and shape of the hole vary wildly with the application, 
depending on the operational needs of the engine. The function is to let
unmetered air into the intake system, which raises the idle. As the engine
warms up, the hole rotates away from the passage and no air flows -- i.e.
only metered air is let into the engine. 

Failure of this gizmo causes the car not to run very well when cold. If
it sticks open, the car runs great when cold but runs lean when warm due
to the extra air bypassing the metering system.

And if you put the wrong unit on your car because you can no longer get
the right unit due to parts supercession, the car just doesn't run as
well. I know this to be a problem with Euro models... Had to do surgery
on a perfectly good aux air unit to change the hole size.

  So I want to know these prices in the U.S.(sorry, I dont know these parts
  number...) and import some to JAPAN because especially rear 8J wheel is 
  too nallow for tire size(255/40-17) and the whole balance of the car with 
  wide wheel is shapely. Genuin parts price in JAPAN is too expensive for 
  me and I know from some information that these price in U.S. is reasonable.
  If shipping is very low cost, I can buy it for reasonable price.

  Any information(parts price, shop recommendation etc.) I appreciate.

WHAT!!!!  You pour it on your driveway?  Do you know what happens to that 
shit?

Where do you live that you are allowed to dump waste oil like that?  In 
California, you'd get busted for illegal dumping of hazardous waste. 
 Recycle it.

Even using oil as chainsaw lube is becoming environmentally incorrect.  I 
saw some info about the amount of saw oil dispersed in  forests by loggers 
and us home-type woodcutters. Just by the splatter.  It's enough that new 
lubricants have been developed that are environmentally/loggerly friendly.

Evaporate the brake fluid if you can't find anyone to take it.

(Stepping off soapbox)

It would be a bummer if your P-car ended up over the cliff, however.

I'm not an owner, but the specs call for DOT 4 - 200 brake fluid. This is a
new type which has higher wet boiling point than the usual DOT 4 and is less
hygroscopic. Because of this, Porsche increased the recommended brake fluid
change interval from 2 up to 3 years.

I'm restoring a 69 912.  When I bought it, it didn't run and looked ugly. 
 Now it runs and looks ugly.  Does anyone have any interior parts - seats, 
dash, door panels (black) for sale OR have any suggestions of a good place 
in the L.A. area for getting the interior re-done and for a paint job?  Does 
anyone have any experience with re-doing seats themselves?  I hear Autos 
International sells kits for this.   Also, I need a drivers side window 
crank mechanism if anyone has one of those lying around.

Budget-wise, I don't have a lot to spend but I hate nothing more than paying

When the local auto shops stopped accepting used oil due to the
disposal costs, California required places that SELL new oil to accept
up to 5 gallons of the black stuff, no purchase required.  You might
check on this where you are.

Dumping oil on a gravel driveway is not a nice thing to do; it all
washes into some body of water eventually!

As for the other fluids (brake, coolant), my county and nearby city
governments have "disposal days" (they take motor oil and batteries
too) on a regular basis.  Ask them; if they say "No" then remind them
of the alternative...

Subject: Re:D&M Palo Alto/Dieter

I had an experience at D&M I'd like to share. I was going to sell my 912, Thank
goodness I didn't. It's a keeper. Anyway, This guy comes to my house to look at
the car, He likes it and gives me a deposit. He tells me he wants to have his
mechanic check it out. I tell him there is no problem at all. I know the car
and it's not concour but it's damn good. So I bring the car to Palo Alto from
SF in perfect running order. I meet up with the guy and he introduces me to 
Dieter. I don't know this guy so I want to see what he's gonna do to the car.
I mean I still own it. He goes balistic that I'm watching him and says that
he wont do the inspection with me watching. I get all steamed but I let him do 
what he wants. About an hour later I hear him triing to start the car. It wont
start. So I go into the garage and have a look. His associate that helped him 
with the compression check jamed the accelorator to the floor, which inturn 
left the throttle wide open. I'm glad it didn't start! (The linkage needs Adj.)
So I point out to him that the throttle is stuck wide open and it's flooded.
I unstick the throttle and he pulls the plugs and "cleans" them. Ok not a big
problem so far. He puts the plugs back in and noe the car starts, but it's 
running on three cylinders. What the *&%#$* did he do! I`m getting pissed and
the perspective buyer is losing interest. He pulls the plugs again and one of 
the electrodes is bent, he straightens it and puts it back in. Same thing, but
this time he takes the buyer for a ride. Sounds real bad and I'm getting madder.
He comes back, pulls the plug again and I notice there's no compression ring
on it. The ring is gone into the black hole of the shrouds. He has no replace-
ment plugs on hand but I do in my tool box I keep in the trunk.(just in case)
New plug everything is fine except the buyer. He wants no part of this but
since he's paying he'll wait for the report. Dieter`s report: The car is
very good, No rust..Best one he's seen in a while. Needs heater cables,
claims new trans mounts(driied out), Needs tires soon, compression is good,
etc,etc... Small stuff. 
Moral: Dieter could have done better. He blew the sale by making mistakes.
I'm glad today that it turned out like this. I'm gonna keep the car for a long 
time. It's the only one that works all the time including the new one(not a 
Porsche, too bad.) He drove the buyer away from the sale because now the
buyer thinks he's gonna visit dieter alot. Good for dieter, bad for the buyer.
Now dieter doesn't have either, a customer with a 912 or a good recommendation.
Enough drivel already.......2 more cents.

Mike,
I have used Cool Carbon and Performance Friction pads extensively. Of course
this is on a track situation but I think you will find the same results in
AutoX. Performance Friction are a bit grabby when hot but otherwise
excellent. Cool Carbon are a bit easier to modulate but require more leg
pressure. Both last a long time. I also found that Performance friction
tended to warp rotors. They claim to have changed their formulas at this
point.
Bottom line is that you probably can't go too wrong no matter whose product

When I was Parts Manager at AutoThority, in the early '80's, these were 
the only P's & C's we would use for 2.7's. The pistons were forged, where 
all others were cast, the cylinders were Nikasil, and the compression 
ratio was identical to the "swirl top" pistons at 8.5:1. We never had any 
problems, and I used to buy two or three sets a month. It didn't hurt 
that if someone decided to build up the engine later with hotter cams, 
there was never a clearance problem, either. I would use these.

Using the redline is still the best overall advice for upshifting.
 Absolutely do not worry about downshifting.  You should not be using it to
brake the car.  Keep both hands on the steering wheel, brake hard in a straigh
t line and when the car is well slowed down, shift it down.  The good drivers
will go straight from 5th to 2d when they are real busy at the end of a fast
straight followed by a slow turn (Elkhart Lake 5 and 12, Heartland 1,
Brainard 3, Second Creek ???..no fast straights etc.) Wear out the brakes,
not the gearbox, and save the risk of an over-rev when the rev-limiter won't
help on the downshift.

The second key hole is for a factory alarm.  There is a second key, sturdy
with a smaller grip than the
 ignition key, that operates the alarm.

The alarm is armed when the key hole is in the horizontal position.  If
anyone opens either door when armed, the alarm will sound and cut the
iginition.  Thats all it does, though the ignition cutting is important.

Your best bet is the check with the County sanitation District. Or as

Our county has disposal days and will take this stuff off your hands if

The spacers go on the bottom of the steering rack between the mouning 
points. you need to get under the car and take off the metal protection 
plate covering the steering rack. You may be able to shine a flashlight 
in the tie rod end area and see if you have what looks like washers 
under the rack. If the car is lowered at all you should have the 
spacers. They are avail from all aftermarket suppliers.

Put them in before your alignment as the toe will have to changed to 
accomodate the spacers.

Dear Drivers,

	All this talk of shifting points and heel toe braking has brought 
up a question in my mind.   I haven't done any competetive driving YET, 
but trying to learn as much as I can.
	My question is as follows:

	According so some of the posts here, coming up to a turn I should 
keep the car in the gear it is in.  Brake only should be used, no 
down-shifting to slow down.  After braking, put the car in the necessary 
gear for the turn and step on the accelerator through the turn.  If this 
is the case, where does heel-toe braking come in?  According to the previous, 
there is no reason to have your foot on the brake and accelerator at the same 
time.  Am I missing an important point here or is it just a matter of 
driving style?

Caveat:  I haven't seen this top, but I know this guy and he's OK.

First off, he want's $1000.00.  Original price was $2600.00 Says it's in 
great shape, seals and all, and comes with the matching front 'bow' piece 
for the front windsheild that has the locking mechanisms, so it should fit 
any year.  It was originally for a 75-76. Unlike the 3rd party top I'd seen, 
this is a factory top and is made from a high impact plastic material, 
finished in black.  Smoother texture than a 914 top.

to work on front of engine).  Also, in '87 rear wheels widened by 1 inch to 8";
rear tires went from 225/50-16 to 245/45.

'89 and on have final drive ratio of 2.7 rather than 2.2 of the predecessors.  I
would much prefer the higher (numerical) ratio on my '86, but the ring and
pinion set is about $1,300.  As it is first gear is almost like second on some
other cars, and I turn about 1800 RPM @ 60 in 5th, which IMO is extreme loafing.
I'd rather turn 2200 RPM and have 22% more torque.  The common explanation is
the gas-guzzler laws, since Euro cars kept a 2.7 or so ratio all along. 

Highly recommended reading: Bruce Anderson's series in "Excellence" on buying a
used Porsche ("Porsche Price Trends").  Also, Porsche Technical Specifications,
86-89 928, for $10-$15 at many Porsche parts suppliers.  And: Euroselect parts
catalog, which from Stoddard comes with a prices list for both Euroselect and
Porsche parts.  An evening spent scanning those parts prices is a sobering
education in the reality of 928 ownership.

BTW, my local Porsche dealer just replaced my (multi-disk) clutch at 80,000 mi.
for $1,000, p&l, using Euroselect parts.

Good Hunting!

Sean,
Before the 'Bursch' exhaust my 69-912 had a 'Monza' system that was
much quiter. It did rust out fairly quickly. Back then though I was
living in Connecticut and the car was in storage for 6 months/year.

All in all I'm very happy with the Bursch system. It's lasted more than
six years so far (2 years the car was being restored), and I actually
enjoy making like a Harley once in a while!)

Yes most parts are the same for 911 and 912 automobiles. The torsion bars
are a little thinner for the 912 (26mm - 27mm rear) due to lower engine
weight.

>and got the idea that NOTHING has ever been replaced in this car's 66,000 
>miles!  Especially bad are the shocks,

Actually that's not all bad. This way your sure that EVERYTHING is original,
and probably no incompetent mechanic has had his/her hands in it. The 912
is a joy to work on though, so my advice is either find the BEST mechanic
in your area to work on the car (no matter the cost) or do the work 
yourself. I nearly lost my P car to incompetent work (once resulting to a 
fire due to a loose FUEL line and another near engine loss (on the H-way) to 
a loose OIL line). Since then I'll pull the engine out myself before letting 
anyone else close!

Take care of her and she'll stay with you forever! Hum well we're talking

both ;-)

Maintenance on my 912 has been reasonable. If you shop around you'll find
good parts for reasonable prices. My favorite parts place is an outfit in
San Luis Obispo, CA called 'German Parts and Restoration' their number is
805-549-8525.

Moisture will go through paint after many years. Although spots could have 
been caused by leaves sticking to the car during fall. 

First few items to buy:
        1) Fire extinguisher (halon)
        2) shocks & all wheel alignement
        3) engine rebuilt along with new clutch (demand to supervise

Can't agree more ... (Ferdinand did'nt hang around in museums)

I spent nearly two years of enjoyable moments restoring my 912. I have
to admit that I did'nt have the money when I started taking the entire
car apart, but I had a garage and I had time. (and curiousity)

Halfway through the project it did'nt look like a car anymore. There were
parts all around the house (yes even the bedroom) (but if you're creative
then can be very decorative if your wife/girlfriend lets you!)

I gained a lot as well. I got a chance to bring it to bare metal and then
put it back together. I will forever appreciate the craftsmen that
worked on my car 25 years before I did.

The 'Project White 912' is now a weekend/nice day (almost everyday in New
Mexico) that looks brand new from 5 feet. (Yes there are many things
that I would like to re-do on the car that I would do differently etc...
but I'd do it again any day)

Warning: Every project section takes 4 times as long as you think.
Warning: You will redo every project section at least two times.
Warning: Don't have a deadline.

Just do it.

George


Being a Swede and employed by Saab (aircraft division) I just have to comment
on this.

I personally agree that it's not that good design to have the parking brake
on the front wheels. This was the design for Saab 900 up to model year 1988 (?).
Saab 9000 and newer 900's have the parking brake on the rear wheels.

Trolls? Yes of course. They just went out of their caves and produced on the
worlds safest cars out of barque. And as they had never seen a car before
(and absolutely not a german one) they, as the first manufacturer in the
world, installed a turbo on a series produced car. 

The very same trolls designed the first serial produced car (Saab 92)
with a aerodynamic body in 1947 (was first shown in Geneve in 1953).
The designer, Sixten Sason, later designed a camera which by modern
standards looks odd. It is however still produced after 46 years
and is still regarded as the best camera in the world - Hasselblad.

The aerodynamic design was introduced in other cars much much later. 

I can agree with you, George, the old 900 is a bit odd when it comes to
e.g. position of the pedals and the parking brake. Despite that, I am 
very proud to see that this small country (8 million) can produce
cars, aircrafts, trains, cameras, nuclear plants, satellites,
space equipment, intelligent missiles etc that are technically
very advanced and appreciated around the world.

Sorry for continuing this non Porsche discussion on the net but I just had to
defend the Swedish designers... 

Have a nice weekend!

When I look the rear of a Saab 900, it always make me feel like its shape
is close to the rear of a 911 Coupe (especially the shape of the rear screen).

Ok, it's a very personnal point of view.

Subject: Re: Factory Tours

Pat:

You can often get a "short" factory tour with a "walkin" request to the
Customer Delivery Department Lounge  that is right next to the Porsche Museum
in Works II in Zuffenhausen (follow the signs off the Autobahn).

There are restrictions at certain times of the year for vacations and model
changeovers.  The local Porsche dealer says the factory will be "closed to
the public" (not sure about the museum) during September 1995 for changeover
and initial production of the 1996 Boxster.

Better way if you're a member of PCA, is to write "Fr. Ilse Nadele, Worldwide
Porsche Clubs Coordinator, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche A.G., D-7140 Ludwigsburg,
Germany" and indicate you would be interested in a factory tour.  Since she
coordinates all of the Club visits, you may be able to link up with one of
the visiting groups and enjoy a much more in-depth visit of the facility.
 Ilse is a charming person, and you also might get lunch in the factory
dining hall ("Casino"), or better yet the executive dining/VIP area.

Correct. Porsche 930 came in '77 (?) and Saab in '79. I think Saab

Subject: torque wrenching


There's been some discussion of lug nut and spark plug torque
settings lately.  I don't want to recharge this topic (it seemed
to get old), but I'm feeling somewhat naive ... so here goes.

I've never used a torque wrench for these two applications (Ouch!
I say as I duck for cover).  Anyway, I've always used the
"..grunt..There..That seems about right" method.  Also, the
spark plugs in my 911 are hard enough to get at with socket extension
and medium ratchet (especially the two forward ones) I can't
imagine how I might get a torque wrench in there.

The question is: Am I flirting with danger/damage?  Have I just been
lucky so far?  Or, do I already have damage and just not know it?  I'm
pretty meticulous about everything else.

As an owner of an automatic '91 928, I can tell you why we bought the 
automatic. We had a stick shift BMW 733 earlier (probably the only one 
in the country!) and it was not fun to drive. I associated the problems 
we had with the weight and decided that since the 928 was 3500 lb it 
would be better with an automatic. Voila! Looking back, I do not regret 
it, the 928 auto is very good. And I have some other cars with sticks 
(Caterham 7 and, at that time, C2, now 993).

After you're nearly finished braking, you reach over with your foot, while
still braking, and blip the throttle to match revs as you re-engage the
clutch. The throttle should then come on as the brake comes off. The idea
is to stay on the edge of the friction circle as you transistion from
straight line to lateral g loading. Performing the brake to throttle
transition as you enter the turn is called trail braking. if you can do
that smoothly, you're a better driver than nearly everyone on the planet.
You can practice this at slow speeds on the road. Have fun

I think there has been a misinterpretation of previous comments. For
"performance" driving, you want to perform the downshift while braking,
so that power can be applied as soon as the car is turned. Turn in 
should immediately follow the braking, so there is no time inbetween to
shift (don't worry about trail-braking, where braking and cornering
overlap, at this level of your education). The earlier discussions
related to where during the braking interval should the downshift
occurr. If you are braking at the end of a long straight, into a 2nd
gear corner, and you perform the required shift to 2nd as soon as you
start braking from a high speed, the car will still be going too fast
for 2nd gear when you let the clutch out, and you will learn a lot
about stress failures of engine parts. Instead, do the shift to 2nd
near the end of the braking interval (but still while braking), when
the car has slowed considerably, and the car's speed is suitable for 
2nd gear. The earlier discussion also related to "instrumenting"
some of this with marks on the speedometer or tach, and the
judgement (at least my judgement) was that you should just wait
until relatively near the end of the braking to shift, without
consulting any instruments.

Could someone please explain what 'bump steer' is and what it feels like?
The steering on my 914 feels very tight and solid except when I have the
steering wheel turn all the way to one side or the other - like when maneuvering
in tight spaces in a parking lot.  As I roll along slowly with the wheel cranked over,
everything feels smooth, but every now and then (once per wheel revolution?)
the front end of the car suddenly jumps.  There is a very sharp jolt and then the
steering is smooth again.  It feels almost as though the front tires ran over a
broom stick, except the car wiggles from side to side, not up and down.
When this happens, I don't hear any unusual scraping noises or anything that
would indicate that my wheels are touching any part of the front suspension.
This isn't bump steer is it?  BTW, I'm using stock 165R15's with Riviera wheels.

Handbrake turns don't really hurt the car too much.  Your father sounds 
like mine - wrong, and not inclined to consider engineering as part of 
the answer!

I used to do this alot in Vee Dubs, for kicks and for driver training 
(terrorists and all, you know).  The parts that get stressed are the 
brake cable, which may snap (and really screw you at a bad instant) and 
the tires, which skid for a moment and may flat-spot.  On rain the tire 
damage is lower, and in snow there's little if any damage and it's easy 
to do, especially in a FWD car.

Your car (or your father's) will run just perfectly fine after this 
adventure.  Note that on certain Jetta's the rear parking brake is the 
disk, not a drum as with virtually every car on the [USA] planet.

The parking brake is normally on the rear, but as others mentioned 
yesterday some Saabs have them on the front.

Brian writes:
<All this talk of shifting points and heel toe braking has brought 
up a question in my mind.   I haven't done any competitive driving YET, but
trying to learn as much as I can.>

A little theory about race driving:
On a race track you should be doing one of two things at all times. Maximum
acceleration or maximum braking. For simplicity sake that is the rule even
though it is not always possible or practical.
So, coming down a straight you have your foot on the gas right up until the
point where the brakes have to come on. Since there is a corner coming up at
the end of each straight you must be prepared to accelerate through that
corner with maximum acceleration. Therefore you will have to be in a
different gear than that which you used down the straight.
So the question is if you are braking hard when do you get to change the gear
so that acceleration will take place when the brakes are released?
 The answer is while you are under maximum braking and that is where the heel
and toeing takes place.
So right foot hard on the brakes, the same foot blipping the throttle to
facilitate downshifting and the left foot on the clutch so that the gear can
be changed.
Don't forget to change the gear with your right hand while your left steers.
All this is happening very rapidly and precisely of course.
PLEASE, PLEASE practice this on the street before you set a tire on a track.
Have mercy on your instructor. It could be me!

The BMW 2002 tii was not turbocharged, i think that the 2002 turbo was
released in 74 or 75. Correct me if I`m wrong, but I think that the first
serie produced turbocharged car is the Chevrolet Corvair in the early sixties.
It did not sell much because of reliability problems.

Wow!  They really use OIL??  'Round here (Minnesota) they spread a powder

water to keep the dirt on the road.  The final result looks a heck of a lot like they
oiled the roads though.  And every year I have to scrape all this sticky
sand/gravel/dirt out of my fender wells.  It can build up a couple inches deep
in the corners.

I also cringe every time I drive my 914 over an "unoiled" section of dirt road where
the dust really gets kicked up.  The front of the car stirs the dust up and the engine
and blower sucks it in.  My engine is tan (dirt) colored.  Unfortunately, its the only

Miq,

Finally got together with John yesterday morning. He said he already had

BTW, he does not intend to try and buy it but if you had a nice '87 coupe to

No, it did sell like hot cakes until Ralph Nader rode it to fame with his
book, "Unsafe at any Speed" and, like the 60 minutes bit on the Audi,
scared everybody to death that it would go out of control any time it was
moving.  Actually, the swing axel models ('60-64) handled much like the swing 
axel V-dubs, and in '65 they replaced the swing axel with a full IRS...

A question for the list:

A friend with a 944S2 Club Sport is seeking opinions on wheels.

The car will be run in regional time trials and a few PCA club racing

The brands he mentioned are Speedline, BBS, and (I'm going to try

When I do performance driving I determine gear selection based
on the tach, not on the speed of the car.  I know that the power
on my SC really kicks in around 3500rpm.  I also know that my
car doesn't accelerate any faster (power stops increasing) above
5500rpm.  So when I'm driving on the track I keep the tach in
the range of 3500 to 5500.  And since the tach is the biggest
gauge and it's right in the middle it is easy to look at.  So if
I accelerate out of a turn and the tach is below 3500 I know that
I was one gear too high for that turn.  Next time I should use
a lower gear.

If you will be driving on an established race track you should
equate a given turn with a given gear.  The easiest way to find
out what gear to use in each turn is to ask someone who has already
driven on that track (which will include people in this group).
And it oftern turns out that different types of cars (Porsches, VWs,
Acuras, etc.) will use the same gear for a given turn.  Here is an
example of what of what I mean.  Before the first time I drove on the
Seattle track I asked about braking points and gears.  This is a lap:
turn 1 treat as part of the front straight, turn 2 is 3rd gear, down
the hill is 4th gear, turn 3A and B at the bottom of the hill is 2nd
gear, the back straight is 4th gear, turns 5A, 5B, and 6 are 3rd gear,
at the top of the hill at the apex of turn 7 shift to 4th, turn 8 is
3rd gear, etc.

If you don't have someone to ask then you will have to experiment.
Don't try making the first lap or two perfect.  Try leaving the car
in a higher gear than you think might be needed and see if the engine
bogs down (drops out of the power band).  You should be familiar
enough with your car that engine sound will tell you if if is low
in the RPM band or high.  For the first laps on laps on a new track
you will just be trying to figure out where to turn and shouldn't
be trying to go fast.  On a track you get more than one chance at
each turn so use the repetitions to make small changes throughout the
day.  You will find that it is easy to figure out which gear to use
and very difficult to figure out where to steer.

Hi Stan, Jim, Vol, and the rest of you great guys;

Please forgive the group resonse, but I had to rush to tell you that I've

> Glad to see you back.

Thanks, Vol.  Oh well, I may as well 'fess up and tell the truth (if,
that is, I can identify it; given my lack of proper medication and
surfeit of Macintosh madness).  I've had a bunch of messages from you and
other kindly disposed Porschephilse, that have been eaten by my dog - no
wait, I don't *have* a dog - no wait, I've got a new Powerbook 540c with
36 MB of RAM and a 19.2 KBps internal modem, ummmm, same-same...

Actually, I've just gotten a *second* brand new PB. (god, this is too
long and boring to go into the details, but:) it keeps crashing.  Make
that, *CRASHING*!

Tuesday, I got it back (the *new* new one) from the vendor who kept it
for 8 days (thus leaving me to beg, borrow and steal time from others to
get my mail) and promised to determine why it kept crashing when it was
hooked up to our ethernet network.  While he had it, he lifted the (3rd
party ) extended RAM (which I told him was the *probable* source of the
problems) and the internal, two-piece modem (which, as I explained to
him, was also apparently involved) and drove a completely new Powerbook
under them.  And, I found out *much* later, they didn't check performance
under ethernet because they don't *have* ethernet.  Picky, picky,
picky...Strangely enough, they couldn't duplicate my problems.  Oh
well...

When I got the thing back, at noon tuesday (having been away from the
office and *totally* incommunicado, mail-wise, since Thursday thanks to
the fair Dora spraining her ankle while I was at work Thursday), I only
had 325 messages in my in-box.  So I went through as quickly as I could,
hitting the reply button for your messages, and deleting others as
quickly (and some *too* quickly) as I saw that they were not for me
directly (ooops, and some that *were*), well, you get the picture... (can
you spell *CRASH*?   Say, Bart; have you ever had this problem before?
Oh!  Well, you've got it again.)

Well, good thing I had to foresight to delete the originals as soon as I
hit the ol' "Reply" btn; 'cause otherwise, I'd have to actually reply,
instead of feeding you this puny b-ache about how the dog (er, Macintosh)
ate my homework.  Good thing, too, that the crash(es) totally wiped out
all the pending replies...

I'm awaiting a new 32 MB RAM simm, and a new modem (and another crash,
but I'm confident that I won't have to wait as long for that as for the
hardware...)

I don't know about you, but I kinda like the "escape" story better...

P-philes,

	I recently bought my first Porsche last summer.  It is an '87 
924S.  The car was purchased from a local Porsche dealer.  While 
examining the car, I asked if the car came with a factory alarm.  The 
dealer said that he didn't think so.  But I am still wondering why I have 
an extra key which is quite long.  It's not an ignition key or the key to 
the wheels.  I have just been wondering about it for the last couple of 
months now.  Could someone please tell me what this key might be for?  
And if it is the key to a factory installed alarm, where is the left rear 
quarter deck anyways?  :)
	On another note, the driver's and passenger's seats have started 
to rip, I guess from normal use.  Are there any suggestions as to what I 
should do to fix this problem without having to purchase new seats at 
prices I just cannot afford at the moment?  Some mechanics have suggested 
to bring them to a furniture shop for resowing!  I still don't know.  I 
am also searching for the best tires on the market to fit the standard 
15" wheels that came with 924S.  Tires for street driving during spring, 
summer, fall, and winter (when the weather allows, no ice, rain, or snow)...
	One last question, I have a friend who wants to purchase a red 
911 Targa 1992 with 20K miles.  He was wondering how much would the price 
range be for a car like that.  He said there are no major or minor 
mechanical defects with the car.  Just normal use around the streets of 
Washington D.C....

Thanks in advance...

Hi all;

I was following the recent thread about double clutching and downshifting but I 
missed the final consensus.  After shifiting to neutral and engaging the clutch 
while braking (with my toe), do I blip the throttle (with my heel) with the 
clutch engaged or disengaged before completing the downshift?  I have been 
practicing it both ways and can not really tell the difference.  Which is better 
to prolong the life of the clutch, which seems to wear quickly in the 951s?  
Please respond directly to me to avoid rehashing this subject on the list again.

BTW, while looking through the Washington Post classified section this morning I

I may have to by this for the parts alone...unless its a misprint.  TIA

I am contemplating (forgive me) breaking ranks and getting some experience in

The question is  what are the opinions of you racers out there on the various
driving schools. I live close to and am familiar with Bondurant's impressive

Subject: Engine Stand Advice

Someone asked whether one could use a garden variety 
engine stand on a 911.  Yup.  No sweat.

You do need to make four little adapter gizmos that 
"compensate" for the ridge machined into the 911 
case where the transmission bolts on, but that takes 
about ten minutes.  There isn't enough flat space 
there for the arms of the engine stand to rest on, 
so you have to make flat space with the adapters.  
As usual, it's one of those things that's easy to 
do, but hard to describe.  The "adapter" is 
essentially a piece of aluminum, about 1'2" thick 
and 1" in diameter, with a hole drilled through the 
middle through which the mounting bolt goes.  One 
face of the "adapter" is cut down (you can use a 
file) to accomodate the ridge.  looks like this:


		xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
		x		xx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
		x		x	x	x
		x		x  Hole	x	x	1/2"
		x		x	x	x

     Bart is right (didn't you own that Spyder, Bart ?) but the material I 
 have says that the Olds turbocharged Jetfire (215 ci/215hp from a
 turbocharged, alcohol and water injected aluminum V8) and the Corvair turbo
 were both introduced in '62, and might share the trophy for being first. I 
 used to get a wrinkle when I read the self-congratulatory ads by Porsche
 claiming the first production turbo, when the Corvair shipped more turbos
 their first year than Porsche probably shipped their first 5 or 10...

     About 8k of the Olds were built, the turbo model was abandoned in '64 in
 favor of more naturally-aspirted cubic inches.  I only know about this since
 another Pfiler noted me previously, and I've never seen one of the Olds (yes,
 this -was- your fathers Oldsmobile !).

       Lee A, yes we still have a radically customized '66 Corvair Monza
              in the outback...

      PS. Does anybody know when the Corvair turbo was killed ? Did it
         last til '69 ?

Well I agree, but my point was 3,500 in what gear.  If I want to accelerate
strongly from 30mph it means 2nd, but if it's 60pm its probably 3rd.

  >I accelerate out of a turn and the tach is below 3500 I know that

I thought the goal was to change your gear during the braking so you
could immediately apply power throughout the turn.

Subject: Blaupunkt radio names;

Have you ever wondered what those letters and numbers after the "town name"
of a Blaupunkt radio mean? I came across a sample decoding of one name
today.
 
Example: Blaupunkt Koeln SQR 22
 
S = search
Q = quartz tuning
R = reverse (autoreverse, they mean)
2 = 20 Watt output
2 = sales begin 1982

Rack spacers *definitely* change the handling, and minimizing your bump
steer is one of the more satisfying (IMO) things you can do in the
handling department.  Disclaimer: even at stock height my 'SC has bump
steer.  I presume Porsche put it there for a reason; I suspect it may be
a passive safety feature (?? reduces steering input when road dips ??
something like that anyway).  So adjust at your own peril, and take it
easy until you're familiar with what's going on.  Read Puhn's book for a
the theory.

Anyway what you want is for the tie rods to be parallel to the control
arms (A-arms) at your static ride height.  This eliminates (in theory)
steering input caused by suspension movement.  Crawl under you car and take
a look, you'll see the various parts, and this will make sense.  The
factory (I'm told) gets things parallel by moving the steering knuckle
(outboard end of tie rod) up and down on the strut, so that is probably
The Right Way to do it.  Since it involves strut removal and a hydraulic
press (at least), most of us don't bother with this method (though you
can buy struts set up how you like).

The Shade Tree method is to move the *inboard* end of the tie rod, by
moving the the steering rack up and down.  Of course the steering wheel
linkage doesn't necessarily like this, and there isn't a large amount of
room (adjustment range) available, and the rack mounting may be weaker
afterward... what's that?  the *Automashin* catalog doesn't mention these
features?  guess they needed the space to sell "Porsche Nut" paperweights!
Notwithstanding those drawbacks, you *can* adjust bump steer this way,
and since even I have lasted 100k miles since doing mine, I guess
Porsche put a big enough F of S in the steering gear to survive this
sort of modification.

The rack height is adjusted by putting spacers between the rack and the
aluminum subframe that it's bolted to.  The spacers are little donuts
that go over the two 17mm subframe bolts.  To really zero out the bump
steer you need a *range* of adjustment, though the one-size-fits-all kit
sold by Automashin is a good place to start.  I added fender washers to
the stack as well until I got the right geometry, and then had a
machinist make up aluminum bushings of the correct length.  You also
MUST install bolts that are longer by the length of your spacer, to have
any hope of keeping the mounting strength equal.  Use the same kind of
bolt you took out, too... on my car I believe they were 8.8 type.  After
you raise the rack you have to go up in the trunk and loosen the
u-joints in the steering shaft and spin the wheel a few times to allow
the various connections to "adjust" to the new rack location.  Make sure
the steering is free at all points while the car's still up in the air,
you don't want to find out about an interference while you're on your
test drive.  On my car the limit of rack adjustment is set not by rack
travel but by where the steering shaft starts clunking against something
in its tunnel.

So give it a try; like I said you will notice a big change in the way
the car handles and responds to bumps.  For testing find a repeatable
bump in a curve to drive over at a (large) repeatable speed; I found a 
spot on the freeway I drive daily with a gentle undulation, just enough
to move the car up and down on the suspension.  When I started (after
lowering my car) this "whoop" would provoke about a two foot wiggle in
the car's path (at 75 mph); after a few weeks of messing around...
nothing (from the front wheels, anyway).   Feels great! 

 -Ed
meed@mbari.org


 

i.e. it reduces steering input when the car
goes over a "whoop" (pulls negative Gs) or some such.  Anyway, adjust at
your peril

I took the Jim Russell school Techniques of Racing  course last year and had
an absolute blast!!  They use Van Dieman FF vintage '75 for their cars (I drove
number 4) and are set-up quite nicely.  I could go on and on about the
experience, but suffice it to say that once you go to a formula car, sedans
and sports cars are just second best.  The course lasted for 3 days and I took
it with the mechanics who work on the cars.  Of course, some of the cars had
the obligatory Demon Tweak, but most were very even.  The course was at Laguna
Seca, a most interesting ride.

Anyway, I'd highly recommend the Techniques course to anybody interested in cars
or in going fast.

And the instructers were great.

later,
bill

Pouring the stuff on the ground creates a plume of contaminated soil
(plus likely runoff) that may well reach a freshwater body in or on
the ground.  If you leave the same stuff to evaporate, (1) some of it
will be chemically degraded before it precipitates out at all; and (2)
the eventual surface concentration on the ground will be so miniscule
that biodegradation will take place far sooner than pollution by
leaching.

I was driving a '86 944 w/ the same exact tire for 3 years. I was very
happy with the D40 M2's. Have tires improved enough to warrant switching to
others.(assuming they don't cost more than say 20% more.)

How on earth can you determine the best for your application when you can't
try them ?

I have just sold the '86 and relaced it with a '88 944 Turbo S. It came
with Pireli P-Zero's but the rear two are worn out completely. I know you
should stay with  the same type all around but I don't think I can afford
P-Zero's. I've also heard that they are overpriced for their performance.
Any thoughts on what I should do ?

Those are real good questions with hard answers; it depends on the owner.  I
like mine (I used to love it but the cost of parts is pissing me off) but the
facts are the cars (all model years; maybe not the post '87 stuff, though) have
problems that are expensive to fix.  For example:

#1. Since '78 and up to '86, Porsche has changed the clutch set-up (different
pressure plates, friction surfaces, amounts of pressure plates and friction
surfaces, throw-out bearings) 5 times!!  They KNOW it had a problem and they
tried to fix it FIVE times by redesigning it!!

#2. Since '78 and up to '86 they had 3 different types of fuel injection
systems.  '78 and '79 had CIS, '80 to '82 had AFC, '83 had DME (?).  It has 
changed completely every few years making parts hard to come by.

#3. Spark plug wires cost $185 !!!!!!!!!!  And the plug wires for the S4 cars
with twin distributers are about $240

If you can't work on it yourself, you'd better have plenty of cash.  Maybe the 
owners would rather have a new, reliable, warranteed Hyundai.

I have seen a lot of car fires; not one that appeared to be primarily
fed by brake fluid.  Yes, it's flammable, but it just doesn't leak out
fast enough to fuel much of anything.  And it has nowhere *near* the
volatility of gasoline, ie it won't flash back to the source.

Glycol brake fluid IS a strong reducing agent.  You should keep it

According to the January 18th issue of AUTOhebdo (a french motor racing
magazine), the so called Porsche WSC 95 is powered by a 962 twin turbo 3.0l
engine (type 935/85) limited to 540 hp (by an air restrictor probably) to
comply
with the IMSA/Le Mans regulations. The article also mentions a 956 gearbox.

The chassis is derived from the TWR-designed Jaguar XJR 14, which took part
in the 1991/92 IMSA series and in the 1991 world endurance championship. The
similarity between the two cars is obvious on the picture that accompanies the

    You've got me ! Why would any Porsche technician slam a 928 but not a
 a 944 ? What supposedly is different about their makeup ?

   The reason the crater in price is probably the same reason Cadillac
 Allantes crater--fantastic cars, but there are lots of other fantastic
 cars in the same "luxury sports" league (Mercedes, BMWs, Vettes, etc) so
 that class of cars is maybe less distinguished than the 911 in terms of
 looks, ride, and owner loyalty.

    Geez, you can get 290 hp, 32-valve sound, excellent brakes and true
 comfort for $15k in a 928. You can find 16 valve cars all day long in
 Houston for under $10k. Either will take you past 200k miles if you look 
 after them, cruise comfortably at 100mph, and pull thru corners like its
 bored with you. Its the one Porsche where you can be a truly average driver
 and still get around quickly (Wrong gear ? Wrong line ? Change your mind
 on those brakes ? No prob !). Its the only car I've ever driven in where
 speed only showed up on the speedometer, but not in the feel on the road.

    When the 928 came out, it was toted as -the- supercar. I'm sure there
  are lots of other great cars too, but I don't know how anybody could
  keep from being impressed by a 928.

Yes, I just didn't say that clearly but I also didn't contradict that.
I simple way of thinking about it is - brake in a straight line, do the
downshift at the end of the braking zone, if you have judged things
right the turn starts immediately when the brakes are released.  From
the start of the turn until you near the apex your left foot is on the
gas pedal keeping the car at a constant speed, then close to the apex
of the turn your foot starts going to the floor.  By "accelerate out of
a turn" I was refering to the region from the apex of the turn until
the turn is finished or where ever you start pushing the gas pedal down.

Hello,

I took my '85 944 (early model) to my mechanic to have the timing belts 
retensioned (1000mi after timing belt change). He noticed that there was 
an oil leak from the oil cooler. I knew about the leak for a while now, 
but lately the leak has turned into a gush. I know that there are oil 
cooler seal kits available. How hard would it be to fix the oil cooler 
seals. I have the HAYNES manual which has the procedure for the removal and 
installation of the oil cooler. Has anyone ever done such a job? What 
kind of tricks should I be aware of. I am pretty sure that removal of 
some of the exhaust is necessary. How should I avoid breaking some of the 
nuts and bolts of the exhaust system. I appreciate any help.

I am a current owner of a '84 928S Euro. This car is just amazing.
As many people would expect this car's electric system may go
wild anytime, something falling apart, this and that loosen up.
But I'm experiencing none of such thing. All electric systems work
fine. Never failed to start. Feeling as solid as it looks. (except
the sunroof inner lining is loosen and makes some rattling noise.)
Just recently on a trip from LA to Bay Area, the car hitted 150mph.
I even use the car on everyday basis. With the traffic in LA, the
car still never over-heat (thanks to water cool!) Only difference in
traffic is shifting in and out of gear gets harder. (Maybe I just 
feel limp being trap in the traffic :P) Anybody can explain that.

Here, I would like to ask a few questions:

1) My car is a Euro, with 5 speed. I don't see many 5 speed on the
   street, and Euro is just as rare. I wonder how many other Euro
   928 is on the street. Can some of Euro's owner raise their voice,
   or Someone have any figure?

2) The Euro's are much stronger, with 221kW (300hp) power. Why they
   didn't give the same spec to the US version?

3) Can someone put a newer picture of 928 in the picture archive!?
   That one is fading!!

Happy Driving.

	If you don't use a torque wrench on your wheel lugs you run a 
very good risk of warping your rotors.  And on the spark plugs you run 
the risk of stripping the threads, real easy on aluminum heads.  At best 
it will weaken the threads.

Mike,
	I'm sure my recycle man has passed my name along to the local
AA counselor.  I was into some home winemaking a while back and
started collecting used wine bottles to use for my home brew.
Friends and relatives would save their bottles for me and in a short
period of time I had 10 to 12 cases of empties.  Well, over time, I
lost interest (and the wine wasn't that good) so I decided to rid
myself of the bottles.  Every week I would fill the glass recycle 
container with about 8 to 10 bottles.  It took months to get rid of
all those.  I wonder what the neighbors thought?

Mike,
I can second Jerry's recommendation of carbon-kevlar based pads.
I've been using Cool Carbon (blue compound) pads in my 951 for both track and 
autocross.  Different cars so you probably need a different compound due to 
weight diff.  I think green is for racecars (read higher coeff of friction) 
and red is for lighter cars?  Check this out with a dealer.

Pros: they stop *now*, I've had no problems with fade, boiling fluid, warped 
rotors etc despite repeated hard braking from ~130 to 60; they warm up quickly
for autox use, they're easy on rotors and they're long-lasting.  
Cons: they squeak like the devil for street use and the (carbon?) dust builds 
up quickly making it difficult to keep wheels clean; they're damned expensive 
($250/set).  
Due to the cons, I put back the regular pads at the beginning of the winter 
saving them for the track season. I can definitely feel the difference in 
stopping power.  You can brake much later with the CC pads.

The break-in procedure is to find a deserted road and brake firmly to a 
complete stop from successively higher speeds without locking up until they're
'bedded' in.  New rotors are not needed.

Maybe so, but it's nothing compared to *your* misunderstanding of "pca

I think you missed the point.  The complaint is that non-performance 
mods move you to street prepared when they deliver no performance 
above a stock car.

First, PCA doesn't allow or disallow anything, ZONES set their own rules.
There may be national rules at Parade (don't know, never been) but for 
the garden variety auto-x that people drive their cars in more than once
a year, it's zone by zone.

For example:

Second, zone 7 stock it just that: Stock.  Pretty much the only changes 
allowed are non-performance changes that will protect engine/car 
life.

You are thinking of either the improved or production classes (again
zone 7).

Again, scca was being damned for not allowing non-performance mods.

The only mod you list that might be acceptable under zone 7 stock is the
shock replacement (depends on the shock).  Disallowed items:  muffler (if
not functionally equivalent to stock), airfilter, sway bars, allignment, 
tires (with treadwear less than 120).

You have done *much more* to improve the performance of your car than 
any zone 7 stock car.

This is not really the issue.

Zone 7 mods in stock class that scca would not (if I understand
correctly) allow are:  oil system (e.g. deep sump, oil coolers, accu-sump)
enhancments, and chain tensioners upgrades.  

Admittedly, allowing the engine to run cooler is an advantage *because it 
means you will finish more events*, but is that really bad?  Or really an
"advantage?"  No.

The chain tensioner mod has no performance advantage what-so-ever, and 
shoud be done to *all* pre '84 cars (excpet the two years where you can't).

Yet these would move the car out of stock...

The above is basically irrelevent to the issue at hand:  Why are
non-performance
mods not allowed?  To all cars?  So Porsches still win.  They just win at more

risk to the engine than necessary.  

911 engine rebuilds are in the neighborhood of $10,000.  Chain tensioner 
replacement is about $600 for original or $800 for pressure fed ($200 and 
$400 for the parts).  No one in their right mind would put original tensioners

in a pre-'84 car.  Yet unless they do, they have to drive in street prepared 
where they are *not* competitive w/o more money.

While I understand the dificulties of arranging the classes so that all
marques
can compete, this one escapes me.  I challange you:  What's the reason if not
stupidity or "dislike?"   My vote is on stupidity.  Not you personally Byron,

This is not to say that the service has always been perfect . . . they have 
made a few minor mistakes over the years but they've always been quick to own 
up to the errors and make them right no questions asked.   
 
In addition, my experience has been that the time they spend on various jobs 
and the associated prices are reasonable. 
 
I've also referred a fair number fellow German car owners to D&M (Porsche and 
VW) and never had anything but positive feedback. 
 
I certainly have no intention of defending what was clearly a situation that 
should have been handled better, but I would hate to see a local, independent 
shop that generally does very high quality work damned for a single 
unfortunate incident.

I had an experience at D&M I'd like to share. I was going to sell my 912, Thank 
goodness I didn't. It's a keeper. Anyway, This guy comes to my house to look at 
the car, He likes it and gives me a deposit. He tells me he wants to have his 
mechanic check it out. I tell him there is no problem at all. I know the car 
and it's not concour but it's damn good. So I bring the car to Palo Alto from 
SF in perfect running order. I meet up with the guy and he introduces me to  
Dieter. I don't know this guy so I want to see what he's gonna do to the car. 
I mean I still own it. He goes balistic that I'm watching him and says that 
he wont do the inspection with me watching. I get all steamed but I let him do  
what he wants. About an hour later I hear him triing to start the car. It wont 
start. So I go into the garage and have a look. His associate that helped him  
with the compression check jamed the accelorator to the floor, which inturn  
left the throttle wide open. I'm glad it didn't start! (The linkage needs Adj.) 
So I point out to him that the throttle is stuck wide open and it's flooded. 
I unstick the throttle and he pulls the plugs and "cleans" them. Ok not a big 
problem so far. He puts the plugs back in and noe the car starts, but it's  
running on three cylinders. What the *&%#$* did he do! I`m getting pissed and 
the perspective buyer is losing interest. He pulls the plugs again and one of  
the electrodes is bent, he straightens it and puts it back in. Same thing, but 
this time he takes the buyer for a ride. Sounds real bad and I'm getting 
madder. 
He comes back, pulls the plug again and I notice there's no compression ring 
on it. The ring is gone into the black hole of the shrouds. He has no replace- 
ment plugs on hand but I do in my tool box I keep in the trunk.(just in case) 
New plug everything is fine except the buyer. He wants no part of this but 
since he's paying he'll wait for the report. Dieter`s report: The car is 
very good, No rust..Best one he's seen in a while. Needs heater cables, 
claims new trans mounts(driied out), Needs tires soon, compression is good, 
etc,etc... Small stuff.  
Moral: Dieter could have done better. He blew the sale by making mistakes. 
I'm glad today that it turned out like this. I'm gonna keep the car for a long  
time. It's the only one that works all the time including the new one(not a  
Porsche, too bad.) He drove the buyer away from the sale because now the 
buyer thinks he's gonna visit dieter alot. Good for dieter, bad for the buyer. 
Now dieter doesn't have either, a customer with a 912 or a good recommendation. 
Enough drivel already.......2 more cents.

Subject: 928 update

About a week ago I put out a request for ideas on diagnosing my
non-starting 928.  I got a couple of good responses and checked
a few things out last weekend:

    Fuel pump
         Is it running?
    	    I listened back by the right rear wheel while my wife
            tried to start it.  It sounded to me like the pump was
            running.

    	 Check the fuse.
    	    The fuse was OK.

    	 Check the relay.
    	    I could hear/feel the relay click when I tried to start
            the car.  (I also heard/felt the ignition relay click.)

    Spark
    	I pulled a plug wire, put in a spare plug, grounded it to the
        head and had my wife try to start the car.  Yeah I was getting
        a spark (at least on the right side of the motor).

    Battery
    	(I checked this because my mechanic said that sometimes
        if the battery got a little low the car wouldn't start,
        even if it would crank over.)

        Well, a couple of the cells were low on water so I topped
    	them off and recharged the battery.

At this point the car still wouldn't start and I was out of ideas.
(I was also beginning to worry about my checkbook since I felt I had
checked out all of the cheap easy things.)  It was time to bring in
the professionals; I had the car trucked to my mechanic for him to
look at.  He went through his diagnosis and discovered that I had very
low compression.  He squirted some oil in to the cylinders, pulled
the fuel pump fuse cranked it a few times, replaced the fuse, cranked
some more and it finally started.  As he explained to me, the engine had
flooded, washing the oil from the cylinders in the process which caused
the lack of compression and hence the no-start problem.  After he got
the car running again he noticed that the cold-idle was lower (< 1000
rpm) than he would expect (~1200 rpm) but claims that the only way
to adjust this is to replace the DME computer ($$$) so its probably
not worth replacing just to up the cold-idle.  He does think that
the cold-idle may be related to the no-start problem though.

Here is the sequence of events that led to the problem:

    1) back 928 out of garage and park it (the car ran for about
       30 seconds, the outside temperature was ~35F)

    2) spend 3 hrs cleaning the garage

    3) start 928 (its running like sh*t)

    4) turn off ignition

    5) try to start 928, no luck
       I tried a few more times with no luck (my special incantations
       didn't help either).

       I know I pressed the gas pedal a few times which would
       contribute to the flooding but I don't know if flooding
       caused it to run so poorly to begin with or if that was
       a different problem and I just made things worse.

    6) push 928 into garage

My mechanic hypothesizes that since the car didn't warm up during
the short time it was running that perhaps the DME computer got
'confused' when I tried to restart it later, flooding the engine.
He suggested that if I had simply driven the car around the block
before parking it that I may have avoided the problem entirely.
I have a EE/CS background and know computers well enough to know
that they can do strange things, but this hypothesis sounds like
a bit of a reach.  Anybody out there have any better ideas?  (Now
there's a loaded question.)

Subject: Porsche maintenance

Howdy,

My '86 928 needs some simple maintenance so I'm here looking for advice.
(The car just turned over 60K miles and I've had it for about 6 months.)

    0) Manuals
       Where do I find some usable/affordable shop manuals (or is that
       an oxymoron)?

    1) Battery Box
       In the process of checking the battery (see my previous post) I
       found that it has leaked sometime in the past and had started
       to attack the battery box so I cleaned the battery box with a
       brush, water, and baking soda.  What are my options for further
       cleaning (if necessary) and repainting the battery box?  (I'll
       need a paint that I can brush on in order to fully cover the
       battery box.)

    2) Brake pads.
       My brakes make too much noise and the rear pads are getting to
       the point that they need to be replaced.  I'm looking for some
       good pads for everyday use.  I used Repco Metalmasters on my
       previous Scirocco so I was considering using them on the 928
       (barring any better recommendations from this group).

    3) Brake fluid.
       It sounds like the general consensus of this group is Castrol
       LMA GT.

    4) Oil
       Any compelling reason to switch to something (non-synthetic)
       other than Castrol 10W-40?

Thanks in advance.

I got the manuals on fisch but I can't remember from where.  Old age agin.  I

10W-40?  Junk in my opinion unless it meets CD/SF or whatever your car's owners

10W-30 in the turbo daytona (not the ferrari).  


Why is it that oil manufacturers can't make 10-40 as "good" as 10-30 or 10-50?
Too many additives?

Subject: Turbos

Bart is essentially right in his analysis of Corvair.  The swing
axle was like the Porsche of the same period.  The 1965 design was
the same suspension used by Lotus in F1 when the Corvair was
introduced.  The 180 hp 2.4 liter 6 was really nice.  Nader lied
and did immoral demos on TV (no air in the tires).  GM wimped.

On the other hand, didn't Studebaker introduce turbo models before
then went under?  I think that was before Corvair.  Anyone got a
good history book out there?

Saab, revolutionary as it was at introduction, was a copy of the
DKW that was one of the few cars to survive reliably thru WW II.
They did not pioneer the three-cylinder two-stroke driving the
front wheels, but copied what was running when the war ended.

"Be careful about richardson's list of expenses... if he is buying brake rotors,

I beg to differ; the 86-1/2 and later cars, at least, are well known for going
through brake rotors quickly.  Mine were well under the minimum thickness spec
at 50K, and now at 80K the replacements are showing visible wear.  And I know
the previous owner (first 50K) didn't use it hard.  To paraphrase somebody
else's 928 quip, "fill er up, check the oil, and change the rotors..."

Fortunately the rotors aren't too expensive and are an easy DIY job.

BTW, I don't think it was Richardson with the list of parts; it was Richardson
who asked the initial question.  And the only list of parts or repairs I can
find in this thread was from Bill Van Bibber and didn't mention rotors, it
mentioned pads.

One of the greatest disservices we 928 owners can do to a prospective owner is
mislead him about how expensive the cars are to maintain.  Or at least to
*properly* maintain.  I found Bill Van Bibber's list quite unrepresentative of
my 30,000 mi. experience with my '86.  He didn't even mention timing belts,
water pumps, or clutches!

He also qualified it with "if you don't have much mechanical aptitude or desire,
you'd better have a lot of cash for the repairs."  I couldn't agree more.  In
fact, I would recommend a strong dose of both aptitude AND desire.  The cars are
very complex, very tightly packaged, and they have a LOT of 4-digit-priced
parts.  Caveat Emptor.

GARY A. PIGHETTI asks a couple really good questions: 

>>>why are they so inexpensive to buy
I think in large part it's the ridiculous parts and labor bills you can rack up
just solving some apparently simple problem.  It's really easy, for example (and
I am not making this up) to go in with a slight driveability problem and drive
out leaving $1,000 behind because the mechanic had to take the whole induction
system apart to replace some hoses, junctions and a sensor or two.

>>>why do so few Porsche technicians recommend them?...they
just roll their eyes and mumble, "Too complex, unreliable, fall apart, scary
electricals..."

That's because they ARE really complex and they HAVE scary electricals.  Mine
hasn't been unreliable or fallen apart, but on the other hand, what other car
needs THREE washer fluid pumps, 24 relays and 45 fuses?

Then of course there's the "image" problem, but I'll let the air-cooled guys
talk about that...

Subject: 928 search update:  Thanks for _all_ the help

Wow!  My questions generated an awful lot of responses.  Thanks to everyone
who spoke up.  The 928 FAQ (in progress) was very useful, and contained
lots of info I hadn't seen before.  At the end of this message I've
summarized the answers to my questions, but first... two 928 buying
stories...


I asked you all for a recommendation for a pre-purchase inspection place,
and had a number of people recommend Tony Heyer at Heyer Performance in
Mountain View.  (one friend of mine heard I was looking for a repair shop
and recommended "Joe's Foreign Car Repair", and when I asked if they
specialized in Porsches, she said "It says 'foreign' in the name!")  I
chose Heyer  :-).
I got a good recommendation for CarreraTech in Campbell too, but Heyer was
closer to the car.

I was looking at a Red '86 928S (70K miles, "must see. All books and
records. overserviced, etc.") that had had some body changes to make it
more like an S4 (and a wierd ground effects package that I was hoping could
be removed).  I had the dealer drive it to Heyer and went there a few hours
later to see how the inspection was coming.

Tony was great.  He asked if I had noticed that all the S4 bodywork was
fiberglass (I hadn't... I told you I'm a newbie) and would shatter at low
impact speeds, requiring expensive replacements (as opposed to the factory
bumpers which are metal and rubber).  While that in itself was enough for
me  (If I wanted a plastic car, I'd drive a Corvette!), he also gave me his
opinions on some other anomolies he'd noticed... the quality of the paint
job/bodywork, a receipt for a new clutch and a receipt for valve job which
both seemed a little early given the mileage of the car, etc...

He had a stock '81 928 in the shop at the same time and he took the time to
show me the differences (between the '81 and the '86 models, and between
the condition of 'my' car and the one he had there.)  Then he answered some
"from a mechanics point of view" questions I had, and charged me an
extremely reasonable fee (since he really didn't get very far inside the
engine before I showed up).  It was a very positive, educational
experience.

In any case, I decided not to buy that particular car, so I'm still in
search of a (preferably black) 928, 5spd in good shape.


Dave Darling mentioned a black '86 928 5spd in the "Diablo Dealer".  Thanks
Dave.  I noticed that one and called about it on a Saturday (a day or two
after their "Grand Opening").  The first three phone calls were answered by
someone who told me nobody was around who could answer my simple questions
(How much?  How many miles?).  Keep in mind that this car was supposed to
be at a car dealer!  Not a great way to run a business, IMHO.  Anyway, the
fourth call revealed that it had 80K miles, and they were asking =8919,600.
Also, it was a "must see, overserviced, etc."  (I'm beginning to doubt
claims from used car dealers.;-))

The next day I drove about 40 minutes to see it and... it wasn't there!
Arrgh! The salesman told me that the owner (his cousin) had taken it for a
trip up to Marin county, and wouldn't be back soon.  He also "revealed"
that his cousin (22 yrs old) didn't really want to sell it, but that his
father thought it was too dangerous, which makes me wonder if he's driving
like a maniac.  We were chatting for a while and he said "The car's in
great shape.  He loves it, it's his baby." So I asked to see the books and
records, and found out he doesn't have any...   When I added up all the
evidence, this car seemed a little risky even though I haven't seen it in
person (and I was pissed about it not being there), so I'm still looking.


The next stop for me is the "Porsche Market Letter" which should be in my
mailbox today.  I also found a web site
(http://www.sjmercury.com/searchcl.html) that lets me search the San Jose
Mercury News classifieds for 928's.


- ------
Here is the condensed version of the answers to my questions... I'm
collating this from a large number of messages, but any misquotes are
entirely my fault.

>1) Where are all the used S4's?
There just aren't a lot around, because Porsche doesn't sell as many.

>2) If there are that few S4's, are the differences between the S and S4
>worth >the time it takes to find one?
Some said yes.  Some said no.  It depends on what you want and what you can
afford.  With an S4 you get more HP, new body, new (improved) single-disc
clutch, but higher prices.

>3) I noticed that not many of the vocal porschephiles seem to own late
>model >928's.  Is there something you know that I should know?
Again, there just aren't as many out there.  One person suggested that
owners of very late model Porsches aren't as "into" the Porsche scene
(perhaps because they don't have to spend so much time fixing them) as
owners of older models, and so they just aren't as vocal.  (this was not a
"late-model owner" flame.  They phrased it much better than I did...)

>4) Why are there so many automatic 928's?
Because it's supposed to be a luxury car, not a little speedster.

>5) Is it worth the extra money to find a 928 with very low mileage (< 30K)?
In general, no.  They last a long time.  Don't rush out and buy a car with
200K miles on it, but don't worry too much about 10 or 20K here or there.

>6) ... what kind of paint job should I get that's worthy of a Porsche?
(also, "Should I repaint the car?")
The general consensus was it's very difficult to paint a 928 well, so
expect to pay a lot (=89$4000) for a good job, but it can be done, and it
will lower the resale value.


Again, thanks for all the advice.  Further updates as events warrant... :-)

I should have said that this is the work that I've already done to it, not that
has been done to it.

Actually, the water pump had already been replaced on my car and I figured while
I was in there I'd replace the timing belt ($30.00) and fix the oil leaks (the
complete gasket kit cost $260.00) .  But look at the little $18.00 dollar part;
the pilot shaft bearing.  That required taking out the twin clutch pack and
twin pressure plate system (HEAVY) to replace it.  I figure that job woulda cost
about $1000.  And the ignition key; cheap parts but UNBELIEVABLE disassembly
of the vehicle.  Easily another $1000.  The clutches seemed to be in great
shape so maybe that, too, had been replaced.
Funny, the rotors seem fine.  Opps!!  I've jinxed (sp?) myself!!!

The moral is "If you WANT to play in the Big Leagues, you got to pay"

I WANT to play!!

Subject: First turbo cars

 
Porsche wasn't first. Neither was Saab. Try Corvair and Oldsmobile in the
early 1960s. The 1962 Olds F-85 Jetfire had a claimed 215 hp from the
turbocharged aluminum V8, and needed water/alcohol injection to live. It
lasted only through 1964. The turbocharged Corvair Monza Spyder came out in
mid-62 with 150 hp. Later this engine was optional on the Corsa, through the
1966 model year. These things didn't have wastegates so they relied on
compressor sizing to choke the flow. They also tended to do their best
imitation of hand grenades. Porsche's breaktrough was the wastegate,
developed for the Can Am 917.
 
The 911 Turbo came as a 1975 model, late in 1974. Through the end of 1977,
Porsche built 2888 Turbos. Through the end of 1993, total production reached
26658. Not all that limited, really. (Limited by our ability to buy them, I
guess).

First ejection seat was the Dornier Do-335, not the Saab J21, but both had
it for the same reason -- to clear the rear propeller. A few Dorniers reached
Luftwaffe units before the Saab reached the Swedish Flygvapnet, but for the
Dornier, peace broke out before it could reach combat.

Previous responder (Dan) is correct, 1987 944S has the built-in timing belt
tensioner that sets belt tension -- tool is unnecessary.
Balance belt tension can be set by just allowing 180 degree rotation of the

I think the factory short shifter helps a lot on a 915. But the
later shift tower would be nice too. I used the factory short shifter
on an '86 and the difference was HUGE, much easier shifting, and less
grinding into second gear. I don't know why but it did the trick. I wish
I could put one on my '72 but not SCCA Stock legal in a '72 (what is?).

Yes I am serious, this information is based on uk  investigation of a

As stated this information was based on a report - the report could be wrong.


There is evidence in many of the fires that brake fluid either from the 
res, or a fractured pipe was sprayed on to the hot exhaust, only a wall 
fire results, but this fire in turn causes combustion of plastics, and 
eventually fuel lines - then  the small fire gets serious.

You are quite right, the silicon fluid itself is not the major fire 
feeder, but is often to ignitor.

As an aside, some years ago I had a Bultaco MX bike. I had a tank slapper 
that fractured the GRP tank, a gallon on fuel dowsed the engine and 
exhaust, I was still astride the bike and enveloped in a cloud of hot vapour

I have never understood why it didn't burn... Phew

You get that from driving the track or the course. For example:  I know that
Elkhart turn 1 is 3d gear, turn 5 is 2d, turn 6 is 3d gear and the "kink" is
bite you lip and go for it fourth.  Soo..If I have time to downshift and
everyting goes well, I do the heel and toe thing, particularly if I am going
down just one gear.   But, just as often, more often actually, I am very
busy. Going into 5 and I go straight to 2d, turn the car and get full on the
gas. 

We have also found that in very high performance engines, the wear on the rod
bearings (the weakest link) seems to be high reving downshifting.  So, we
avoid using the engine as a brake.. Brake pads a much cheaper than engines
and the brakes are much more controllable, provided you have a bias dial.

Subject: Re: handbrake-induced oversteer

Just a note on this subject that may be interesting to some:
The factory sets up the (911 at least)  rally cars to plan on using the
handbrake.  I have a 70 Monte Carlo 911S (#0002) (3 made) and an 84 954
(Rothman's SCRS) (20 made - 12 race cars) and both came set up for emergency
brake steering. What they do is disconnect the button on the handle so that
the brake will not lock when you pull on it.  The button is actually
"reversed" so you have to push on the button at the top of the "pull" to set
the brake.  We used to use this technique rallying the 911s while we were on
dirt, and we used it less frequently on very tight turns while ice racing to
induce the rear out before we got back on the power.  Obviously it doesn't
work very well to try to be on the power and on the emergency brake at the
same time. So long as the emergency brake is on the rears it will probably
work well, but I am doubtful (but don't have any actual experience) that it
would do much but induce a lot of understeer if it were connected to the
front wheels.

Reagrding comments about braking/downshifting :

For a novice like myself, I've learned that this amazingly-
difficult-to-do-smoothly-when-a-million-other-things-
are-going-on braking/downshifting is not totally necessary.
Someone told me (and I believed him) that the amount of time
saved by performing perfect heel-toe braking/donwshifting
is not a big deal when compared to just getting yourself in the right gear
going into the corner.  FWIW, I brake as hard as I can in a straight line,
then ease up, down shift, and turn in to the
corner.  Not real pretty, but it works, and especially for first-
timers on a track, I'd recommend it - you'll have enough things
on your mind.  One guy at one of our driver's ed events last
summer almost put his car into a wall by doing what I thought
was alot of unnecessary shifting (he tried to shift from 2nd
to 3rd right in the middle of the last turn coming out on to the
front straight - it didn't work).

BTW, I say we keep up these "driving" related threads - that's
what pcars are all about anyway.

You can't. Tires are like religion. You just pick one that sounds good and
hope it does what it claims. If you really, truly BELIEVE that you have the
best tires for your car, you will remain steadfast in that belief,
dismissing all false prophets, and will actually FEEL how much better your
tires perform. (English translation: it's all in the mind of the consumer
anyway). Tire ads help to reaffirm this faith even long after the sale.
 
Me, I worship at the Unified Church of Bridgestone and Yokohama (reformed).
 
Car magazines can't test them objectively either, no more than John Cleese

have less invested in running shoes and trips to Mecca than in Mohammedanism).
In the U.S. at least, most car magazines choose tires at least in part based
on ad buying by same tire makers. (Sorry if that bursts anybody's bubble).

A final thought.  Although the driving schools spend a lot of time on this

pretend that it is necessary, but it really ain't EXCEPT to make sure that
you don't get the rear of the car sideways by not having the motor (hence the
rear wheels) running fast when you let out the clutch. If you brake harder at
the rear than the front the car IS GOING TO GO SIDEWAYS.

     It shouldn't be a problem to convert a good substantial 'merican iron

a couple of routes. 
      1 - cut off the existing attachments at the top of the stand you buy
and weld on, say a 3/8" plate w/ holes to match the yolk, in the cut off
head's place.  (You can do all of this BTW, if you're reasonably sure of your
welding abilities.) Depending on the stand itself, you may want to add a
'gusset on the engine side of the upright.
     2 - If you can't find a decent 'merican' stand, your welding shop  (or
you) can throw a stand together relatively easy using something like 2"x3"x
1/4" wall rect. tubing. This can be a little better and a little more $.  If
you build it 'yourself', you can go heavier tube, wider-longer for more
stability, to your height (taller pr lower) etc. Again, a good shop can help
in several ways.
    I built 3 or 4 for a shop I was involved with in CO a few years ago and
they're still in use to my knowledge.

It appears from this discussion that history is a function of the

Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg folks were producing them in Auburn, Indiana, long
before General Motors (or Porsche, Saab, et al) had their brilliant idea.
 Incidentally, the A-C-D Museum is highly recommended for any lover of fine

outstanding.  In addition to the A-C-Ds, there is an eclectic collection of
other cars and motorcycles (including a 356B and several of Gordon Buehrig's

No arguement there--my exposure is only to local (Alpine Mountain Region
and Rocky Mountain Region) PCA events.  Heck, I only recently became
aware that the local zones/regions run their programs with their own
rulesets!  I'm also beginning to think our local PCA regions are among
the most permissive anywhere!

Soren covers the general problem as follows:
>I think you missed the point.  The complaint is that non-performance 
>mods move you to street prepared when they deliver no performance 
>above a stock car.

Once it was argued that aftermarket spoilers add no performance advantage
since at solo speeds the effect is well below meaningful.  So the
addition of aftermarket spoilers was legal (all of this took place in
SCCA Street Prepared, BTW.)  A Corvette driver read the rule and decided
(correctly I might add) that he was every bit as valid an aftermarket
spoiler builder as any company out there.  Only his spoiler would be so
huge (and incredibly ugly) that it would provide significant downforce. 
The result: a four-foot high spoiler with side fences!  By September at
the National Championships, every car in the class sported 3-4 feet of
spoiler, and all the competitors, including those who had built these
monstronsities, were pleading for a more restrictive ruling.  What
started out as "non-performance mods" had become a "must" for national
contention, and the lobby for more restrictive spoiler rules was
satisfied.

Soren covers the specific problem (chain tensioners) this way:
>I challange you:  What's the reason if not stupidity or "dislike?"   My
>vote is on stupidity.  Not you personally Byron, but the normal
>performance of any committee/bureaucracy that has become

Currently SCCA allows factory directives or recalls in the stock class. 
This means that if the factory felt that something was bad enough as to
warrant a "fix" then that "fix" is legal.  FI, the 914 fuel lines.  The
chain tensioners are something that I'd love to see legal for stock; if
PCNA issued a factory directive requiring better tensioners then we'd
have something.  Barring that, SCCA is in no position to override PCNA's
opinion about what their cars need to live.  You may choose to say that
makes SCCA "stupid", but in fact, our position is, and will remain, that
we'll follow the factory's lead.  

If you would like a stock 911 to have better tensioners doesn't it make
more sense to ask PCNA for them?  They engineered the car, not SCCA.  The
definition of SCCA's stock is based on PCNA's definition as shown by
deliveries when new and factory recalls/directives after delivery.  
Geez, PCNA has a stake in how the cars perform for millions upon millions
of collective miles.  If PCNA is satisfied their cars meet their
reliability requirements who is SCCA to "correct" them?  

Other examples of track-specific problems:  AWD Eagle Talons eat clutches
like popcorn.  Early Ford turbos tend to coke the bearings and destroy
the turbo.  BMW 3-cars have a poor rollover record.  Camaro LSD's burn
out in less than a season.  Neon's snap front spindles.  Miata's overheat
in race traffic.  SCCA is not in the business of intervening when a
street car has design limitations on the track/autocross course/on your
way to work.  While it might be argued (tongue in cheek) that even SCCA
could design a car better than Chrysler, surely you don't think the SEB
makes better engineers than Porsche!?!  :-)

Neat!  I wasn't aware of this!  Maybe this has something to do with why I
receive some flame-mail that says "SCCA is too restrictive in stock" and
some that says "SCCA is too permissive in stock".  

Where is Zone 7?  How different are all the zones?  *Is* there any
National ruleset?  Where can I get National/Regional/Zone PCA rules?

    If it IS the bearings (check and make sure it's not a bad ball joint
or strut) they're easy to replace.  Once you get the rotor off, if one
of the bearings is bad, it will be perfectly obvious.  There's a special
tool to remove/install the bearing races (they're pressed into the cast
iron rotors) but I've found if you can keep the races from cocking in
their mounting areas you can just use a hammer and screwdriver if you're
careful.  (keep hitting one side, then the other.. and when it's seated,
give a few taps every 45 degrees around the race to make sure it's
seated well.)  In fact, the bearings on my 914 are easier to do this to
than the ones on my dad's Chevy.
    Here's my little question for you p-philes... I just took apart the
front end on my 914 and found that I'm going to have to play a little
mix 'n' match with my bearings (I had a complete good set, they just
were not all on the same rotors...) so I took everything apart and
cleaned out all the old grease while I was at it.  What kind of grease
should I use to repack them?  My dad had some ~20 yr. old Quaker State
bearing grease that he bought when his truck was new - but I feel kinda
iffy about using this since my p-car's bearings are so much smaller. 
What do you guys use?

Yes (at least if it's a U.S. car).

Near the DME in the passenger footwell (a cylindrically shaped metal

A properly functioning switch is open at less than about 3300 feet,
and closed at higher altitudes.  To make sure the DME is doing the
right thing with the info provided by the switch, you need an exhaust
gas analyzer.  With the engine idling, disconnect the oxygen sensor
and measure the CO at the pre-cat test pipe.  Disconnect the altitude
sensor and bridge the cable conductors (simulating > 3300 feet of
altitude).  The CO reading should lean out a bit.

>Why DME need this input?

Unlike the LH-Jetronic "hot wire" system, the flapper-box air flow
meters on our Motronic-equipped cars measure air volume, not air mass.
At higher altitudes, a specific volume of air contains less oxygen for
combustion than the same volume at sea level.  To keep the mixture
from becoming too rich, the DME needs to be told to shorten the
injection pulses a bit at high altitude.

Sounds like a pretty radical solution to me.

German Auto of Knoxville (615)-691-1911 puts them in 911's. <- not a
recommendation, just for your information. I don't know anything about them.

Two people have put Paxtons in their cars in our PCA region that I know of.
I don't know where they got it done, or how much boost they were using. One
was a 944. I saw the car in May with the motor, and I saw the car in July
with a different (non-supercharged) motor <grin>. The other car was an early
C4. That car's motor lasted three seasons, I think. In both cases, the
failure mode, as expected, was traceable to the pressurized intake.

Given the type of mods the factory does to 951 motor's, for example,
"bolt-on" power from super/turbo-charging is not what I'd recommend to
anyone... if the car is going to see lower altitudes, I'd be very careful...

Hmm. If these are the same things that are (used to be?) sold for
RV's/Pickups hauling trailers, they certainly *look* like Paxton
superchargers. :) I suspect the main difference would be the maximum boost
<shrug>. 

The address I have for B&M is 9152 Independence Ave., Chatsworth, Ca. 91311.
No guaranty they're still there, though - the address is about 15 years old,
too. I thought B&M sold the big sucker 6-71-type superchargers and the like.
(Now it would be interesting to see one of *those* on, say, a 928 <giggle>)

Stan or someone said to use new crush-gaskets when spark

about 3% at 75 PSI.
But I can't find the gaskets at the auto parts stores I checked.

Any ideas? The plugs are Bosch Silver and they look GREAT!
My plugs are usually dirty and black, but these suckers are

Subject: Re: Heel & Toe soapbox

Hi Mike,
I agree with most of your post and yes you shouldn't be trying the somewhat
"busy" heel and toe technique on a high speed, oh shit I've got to turn now
situation, unless you are comfortable with the technique.
The reason for doing it during street driving is so that the technique
becomes second nature and you won't trip over yourself when it really counts.
Also there is a lot less wear and tear on your equipment if you do the H & T
on a regular basis on the street. I've gotten to the point where I can
synchronize the engine speed precisely enough that I really don't need the
clutch. Off course the car has to be out of gear when doing the "blip" for
the subsequent shift. I certainly do not recommend this as a regular practice
but to illustrate the point.
Seriously after 3 or 4 events and no H & T you are going to find yourself,
one day, with a less than tolerant instructor. He may even have a sensitive
stomach and the lack of smoothness associated by the braking, release the brak
e, then downshift, then accelerate method will be more than he/she feels he
should be subjected to.
Instructing is tough and in many cases hazardous, not to mention thankless in
many cases so a student that practices off track is really appreciated
I feel that the track event doesn't end with the last run group. You should
take your skills to the street. On the other hand there is no reason you
can't practice proper techniques and smoothness on the street before the
event.
I am sure you  are a fine driver, we just want to get you to be a little
better.
Please take my criticism and realize that the intent is at all times friendly
and aimed at increasing the joy of your Porsche experience.
Off the soapbox.

Hmm. Whatever happened to double-clutch downshifting? Students can
approximate double-clutching quite quickly; there is a natural progression
from double-clutching to heel'n'toe; it is safer for the student (and the
instructor :) because the car should be already going slow enough for the
corner after the braking phase; and, most importantly, it is just as smooth
as heel'n'toe... done properly, of course :)

I'm not saying double-clutching is a better or faster technique than
heel'n'toe, but one can be pretty damn fast with either. I remember one
"Instruct the instructors how to instruct" meeting in my region where the
better part of an hour was spent debating the merits of each... people much
wiser and more experienced than myself got pretty worked up over the issue.
In the end, though, everyone agreed that getting the student to drive
smoothly was more important than a particular technique...

Just a thought,
Craig.

>There is evidence in many of the fires that brake fluid either from the

 As a professional firefighter, I've seen perhaps 200 - 300 car fires. I've
never made the brake fluid/engine fire connection-it's possible I suppose,
but it's hard to believe that brake fluid is a MAJOR cause of engine
compartment fires.  

Based on personal experience, non-impact type engine fires are a result of
fuel leaks ignited by (very) hot engine parts, or by an electrical arc (as in
spark). A surprisingly common comment from the car owner is "Damn, I just got
the car back from the shop." I've always suspected that aging fuel lines
disturbed by the mechanic were the culprit, although many times the car is
relatively new. Go figure...

>I had a Bultaco MX bike. I had a tank slapper that fractured the GRP tank  a
>gallon on fuel dowsed the engine and exhaust, I was still astride the bike
and >enveloped in a cloud of hot vapour. I have never understood why it
didn't burn.

The reason motorcycle didn't burst into flame is simply that the engine
wasn't hot enough to ignite the fuel. The two primary factors in any fire are
the "flash point" and the "ignition temperature" of the fuel. Although
gasoline produces flammable vapors at 45F degrees below zero (gasoline's
"flash point"), the ignition source -the heated object, spark, flame,
etc.-must be at least 750F degrees or so (gasoline's "ignition temperature")
in order to ignite the vapors. In this case,  the engine was below the
"ignition temperature" of the fuel. 

What often happens under the hood of an automobile is that common
combustibles like paper, plastic, or leaves which have an ignition
temperature of around 450F degrees  come in contact with various engine parts
well above this temperature. The combustibles ignite creating a flame. While
the engine itself may be below the ignition temperature of the gasoline, the
open flame is now well above the 750F  necessary to ignite gasoline. The open
flame melts the fuel lines, and you presto, you have an engine fire.
 
Porsche 914s were notorious for engine compartment fires. The 914's battery
had a small, raised dike around the cell caps. Rain water would collect in
this dike which was higher than the cell caps. The dike would fill up and
rain water would enter each cell through the cap's vent hole and overfill the
cells, spilling battery acid on a fuel line directly below. Fuel leak plus
ignition source equals fire. And of course these fires are extremely
difficult to extinguish due to the magnesium engine cases used by Porsche
(and Volkswagen). Halon works well, but contrary to popular belief, few fire
department's carry halon extinguishers.

Hi All,
I've been a lurker on the list for 6 months or so, just hanging out and
learning a lot. I just took delivery of my first Porsche, an Polar Silver
(Midnight Blue interior) 993 C-4 coupe 2 days ago, and would like to be
entered in the "who's who."
I have some experience driving high performance sports cars, having driven a
Nissan 1990 Turbo Z for 2 years, among others, but the combination of
handling, performance (even holding to the 4500 rpm break-in limitation),
and exquisite workmanship in my new P-car are truly awesome.  I haven't
really challenged the handling limits but would have to say even slow
corners under significant power produce no noticeable understeer for me.
The car is really neutral on the dry pavement I've been on so far.
I have a question for the technical wizards, though. The transmission seems
difficult to get into 2nd on the upshift (and occasionally on downshift),
with a very firm hand necessary to select 2nd. Is this normal in so new a
car? I had an aftermarket alarm put in the car, and the technician mentioned
in passing that he had mounted a small motion sensor UNDER the shift boot
area, rearward of the shifter. Could this be obstructing the shifter for the
shift to 2nd? If this seems likely, I'll get it back to him, and have the
darned thing relocated or removed!
Thanks in advance, and it's great to finally be a Porsche owner.

Subject: RE: torque wrenching


Hi Wayne,

I guess it really boils down to a question of whether you can tighten things
properly without a torque wrench.  If lug nuts and spark plugs are about all
that you do, using a torque wrench is a good insurance policy.  The
downside to not using is either harming the threads, or putting something
together to loosely and having it back out.  (Seen a bunch of instance of
the latter at the track last year.)

You won't see a professional mechanic use a torque wrench too often,
esp. when it comes to generic nuts and bolts.  Two reasons: s/he has done
it often enough that the wrist is calibrated and s/he can feel the stretch. 
 The
other is of course that using a torque wrench takes extra time.

Me, I'm an amateur and use one a lot more often than my professional
friends.

Hope this helps.

There's good news and bad news.  The good news is that they are nice parts
that flow well.  In combination with a chip, the shop has dyno'd some worth-
while performance gains.  The other good news is that Bill Boat is willing 
to

a number of iterations on the race car, and most recently had a set of
straight pipes made up.  (He also custom made a new one-piece final pipe
and tip for my own 944S when the unavailable factory part rotted away.)

The bad news in a couple of flavours.  Delivery times suck and have pretty
consistently been missed.  The 911 muffler straps break all the time, and we
carry spares.

On balance, if I were looking for an aftermarket exhaust, I'd go with B&B.

 A few weeks ago I worked for a couple of hours trying to remove

 with various types of wrong tools.  For me, short pliers with
 small pins, whether angled or not, kept popping off.  Finally,

 So, I picked up Snap-on tool PR5645A ($20), which is a 9" snap-ring
 pliers with .09" pins at 45deg.  Working from the underside,
 the ring comes right out.

for a early (1968) 911? I purchased the motor, arm and connector rod used
and would like to install them on my car...the questions that I have are:
Where is the activation switch located on the dash? Is the switch the same
style as the rest of the dash switches? Does the wiper motor require a relay
to start/stop at the correct positions? If so, which is the proper rely?

Thanks

Tim,
From my 20+ years experience, I have found no significant difference among
the crankcases for the 4 cyl. engines.

I have used all of these cases for building engines stock and up to 250 hp
racing engines. 

The problems arise when you try to use the VW Typ2 case as there are numerous
differences!

Subject: Re: 914 Pushrod Tube Seals

Dave,

I've found that even using the Viton o-rings you can still get leaks from the
tubes after a period of time. It depends primarily how much heat your engine
develops (whether stock or modified).

In our race engines we must replace the seals at least once during the season
but these are extreme conditions.

Be sure you clean the surfaces thoroughly in the head and case and when you
install the tube with new seal, lube it with oil and be careful the o-ring
doesn't "roll" out ot the groove in the tube.
It WILL LEAK!

Subject: Re: 914 rebuild

Jerry,
Yes it is correct NOT to use the cyl. head gaskets when using the 96mm P&C
kit. The wall thickness of the cylinder is quite thin and I have seen it cut
into the gasket and break off inside the combustion chamber.

Because the cyl. wall is thinner, it can more easily seat into the combustion
chamber surface when it is torqued. Also because it is thinner, if you raise
the comp. ratio higher than 9:1 the cyl. wall begins to distort from the
extra heat buildup.

You need to check very carefully (with a feeler gauge) the clearance between
the top of the cyl shoulder and the top fin (machined boss) of the cyl head.
I like to see .020" min. This is to allow for expansion and compression of
the alum. in the comb chamb.

This clearance will vary depending on whether or not the heads have been
flycut and of course how much.

Have fun!

That's correct. I'm not really looking for a 'full' blower. Only interested 
in maintaining an approximate 'sea level intake pressure density' (or maybe 
a hint more :^) while mountain climbing. I'm actually considering acquiring 
a second engine/transmission for this task since I am aware of the 
increased stresses and temperatures associated with even low boost arrange-
ments.

Does anyone have any tech data on these 'alt. compensators'. My first
question is: Do they offer any form of wastegate or boost management? Since
there is evidence that some folks are using Paxton products on 911's, they 
must have found a way to plumb the flow to the dual carb/intake setup.

They use the highest quality resins available in their composition as well as
a ceramic insulator between the friction material and the metal backing. They
are very nice to the rotors and squeal very little (if at all) compared to

To date PORTERFIELD has only one compound and has not found it necessary to

Yes the steering rack spacers do help with bump steer.

You can tell if you already have them by looking at the steering rack
mounting bolts. The spacers are placed between the rack and the mounting
flanges on the cross mount. They will be approx. 15-19mm thick.

Yes you will need to re-adj the toe setting after inst. rack spacers.

Topic:  Sunroof Alignment

I have a problem with my sunroof alignment on my 911.  The back
edges of the sunroof are not flush with the roof.  It would
appear that the curve of the sunroof is slightly more than the
roof, therefore when the center of the sunroof is adjusted flush
to the roof, the back edges are not flush to the roof level.  As
my car is not on the road now, I thought it might be a good time
to remove the sunroof and reshape it.  My plan was to put some
tension on the center to lesson the degree of curve and leave it
for a couple of months.  Has anyone out there had a similiar
problem?  Do you think the paint would be affected by this
treatment?  Your comments are appreciated.

Use 29 mm rear torsion bars.  The stock bars are 26mm I believe, so going up
1mm isn't enough.

Use the Weltmeister STREET bushings.  The are harder than stock by several
times, but still have a little "give" so the won't rattle your teeth. Forget
the adjustable spring plates; yours are already adjustable from the factory.
 Early models weren't.  Swaybar sizes are fine.  Be sure to use the back up
plates for the front bars where they go thru the inner fenders. Use
Automotions bushing lube.  It appears to work the best to eliminate squeaks.
The above combination will give you a ride that is firm, but not harsh and
gives you the control you need on the track or autocross.  Helps eliminate
squat out of corners, and keep the turbo power on the track.

Use Cool Carbon brake pads.  Even more important at Mid-Ohio is to use the
Cool Brake kit advertised in PANO.  Look for the one that says it uses the
original Holbert molds.  Or Bill Braucksick at Performance Alignment can get
them for you in Cinci. (You DID have hime align and lower your 911 didn't
you!!!???; he does almost all of the track cars in Cinci and
Dayton-advertises in Bent Pylon)  The Cool Brake kit will greatly increase
rotor and pad life and also virtually eliminate fading on an SC or other more
or less stock 911.  Also FLUSH your brake fluid no longer than 2 or 3 days
prior to the event, using a good high temp DOT 3 fluid like Ford Heavy Duty
in the blue can.  Forget Castrol GT; it simply does not have a high enough
dry boiling point.

About your later post on shift points at Mid-Ohio; they will change as you
learn the track.  And you will spend MOST of your first school just learning
the track at Mid-Ohio.  I tell students to just put the car in third for the
whole track until they get turn in points, track out points and apexes down.
You will be REAL busy until driving the track becomes natural, too busy to
worry much about shift points. Your instructor will help you pick shift
points as you learn the track and as you pick up speed. That is what he or
she is there for.  DON'T worry about lap times and revs out of corners your

track.  If you are smooth, fast times will come.  If you aren't smooth, you

rewards smooth.  Most of its turns are connected in some way, so that if you

Subject: Bought a 944-now the questions begin!

Hi everyone,
Two weeks ago I purchased an '84 944 with 53k (!) and all records.  Great 
interior, minor chips on the outside, strong engine. I  
didn't know a person could have so much fun in a car!  Now I have a few 
questions:

I have had the belts replaced and the motor mounts upgraded to the turbo 
mounts.  The car really shook at idle when I bought it, but now it's 
completely smooth.  The previous owner had the water pump upgraded about 
20k ago, and the dealer gave the car a passing grade.  It seems to be 
running great.  Are there any other major things that should be checked?  

On this model, is the coolant fan supposed to 
come on regularly in traffic?  The temperature gauge is always about in 
the middle when on the highway, but it goes past the 3/4 mark in traffic 
and the fan comes on.  The fan always goes off when the gauge has gone 
back to 1/2. I will be changing the coolant soon- I think it's been over 
a year.  By the way, I have some new Prestone in a yellow bottle that the 
Kragen people say is phosphate free.  The label say's it's OK for 
aluminum engines.  Is this right, or should I be looking for the grey 
bottles that have been mentioned here?

Now that the big things are done, I want to start concentrating on some 
of the minor mechanical and cosmetic  details:
 - Anyone know how the rear hatch release switch fits together?  My switch 
triggers the hatch release when it's barely touched, then has to be 
wobbled before it shuts off the power.  I've disconnected it for fear 
that it will pop the back while I'm driving.  Maybe it's missing a part?  
Anywhere I can order a new switch to solder in there?
 - The cruise control stalk was taken apart when I got the car.  I have 
all the pieces....  Anywhere I can get a diagram of how they fit 
together?  I don't feel comfortable doing this by trial and error.

This is getting long...I'll save the rest for later!  Thanks to everyone 
on the List-I would never have had the guts to buy a Porsche (especially 
an 11 year old Porsche) without all this great information.

	[I think I goofed on my submission and this never made it to the

        I made an attempt to do the valves clearances the other day on the 924.
This is the first time I have tried this on an overhead cam motor.  One
big question I had was when do you check the clearance?  The manual states
when the cylinder is at tdz. However this is really only possible
to know on #1 for sure.  It seems to me that you should be able to check the
clearance whenever a cam is pointing straight up.  Is this the case?  BTW
I ended up turning the engine, for lack of an adequate wrench, by putting
the car in gear and pushing the vehicle - can anything be hurt by doing 
this? How about in reverse?
 
        So if I have done the checking right, I found a number of exhaust
valves were over tight.  Around .2mm as opposed to .4mm.  I also found a 
number of scars on the lobes of the tight cams.  This has me worried a bit
as the head was rebuilt about 5000km ago by the PO.  I have not noticed
any real difference in performance, except maybe that the idle is more 
even - perhaps.  I would imagine that tight cams could be bad, opening on
adjustment?

Yep, you did it right.  You can check the adjustment when the cam lobe is
pointing away from the cam follower.  The manuals just pick #1 TDC as a
convenient starting point...

Should not hurt anything to do so, in reverse is a bit more difficult due to
the gear ratios involved...
 
However, it might be easier to take the 
spark plugs out and turn the motor by hand...

Too little play results in burned valves.  I would go ahead and make the
adjustment.  (Keep in mind that too much play causes a clatter, which may be
why the mechanic kept them tight...)

Hi all, I may be very late with this as I am a bit behind on my mail.
 Several P-car owners have been discussing various problems with their cruise
controls, primarily on 928's.  I have the factory manuals for the 928 and
spent some time looking up just how the system works.  Prior to 88 this was a
vacume controlled and operated system.  So YES vacume leaks can and do have
various effects on the system depending on where and how bad they are.  The
basic troubleshooting steps are as follows:
   1.  Ck the fuse No. 7, this fuse is also for the stop lights.
   2.  Connect a manual vacuum pump to the sys. and ck for leaks.
   3.  Ck. for twisted or pinched vacuum lines.
   4.  Ck. electrical connection on the vacuum servo.
   5.  Ck. function of swi. on clutch pedal.
   6.  If no defect is found rmv. the control and ck. on the multiple pin
plug of the vacuum servo.

My belief is that most problems will be in the vacuum system, remember just
how bad German rubber is, and start replacing all the various vacuum hoses.  

Hope this helps.

The viton seals (rated at 400 degrees) are specially made and not available

continual replacement.

As an additional note:  always check the valve adjusting lugs for wear and

Your fuel-injected 2.0 on the open road should return 30 MPG. Any less and
there is a problem.

The most probable cause for the poor 2.0 fuel consumption (and we assume the
brakes are not sticking!) is a defective manifold pressure sensor. After
years, the diaphram breaks and the device can no longer sense engine vacuum
(or lack of it) to adjust duration of injection. What results is the system
thinking you are running at constant full throttle and hence a rich mixture
and poor gas mileage!

The easy way to test the pressure sensor is by evacuation (it looks like a
hand grenade or small pineapple, has a vacuum hose and electrical plug
mounted to it. It is located behind the battery support.) Simply draw 16
inches of vacuum with a hand-held vacuum pump (or suck on the sensor and see
if it holds your tongue). If you cannot draw a vacuum or the vacuum drawn
leaks off, the device is bad. Replacement will instantly rester fuel economy
and bring back hot idle.

Finally, a new pressure sensor may not initially allow the engine to run well
because of other vacuum leaks disguised by the old defective, rich running
unit. Repair of these leaks will ensure good performance. Always change the
oil after installing a new sensor. The old one has caused a rich mixture,
washing of the piston rings and in an extreme case, flooding of the crank
case with gasoline.

Dear Tim,

All 914 cases were basically the same, but differed as follows:  
  '70-'73 1.7 cases were the same except some of the early ones had no oil
baffle plate
  '73-'74 2.0 cases were for the most part a 1.7 case with extra clearance
for the 2.0 piston skirt
  '75-'76 2.0 and 1.8 cases had the extra oil pressure relief valve
eliminated from the side
  '74-'76 1.8 carburated engine cases were tapped for mechanical fuel pump
mounting
  '75-'76 2.0 cases warping in the cam bore and running with excessive
friction. This causes these engines, even when freshly rebuilt, to run so hot
that they cannot be relied upon. Hence, whenever we suspect that one of these
engines has run hot in the past, we replace the case as standard rebuild
procedure, with the '73-'74 2.0 variety or use a 1.7 case and relieve it for
piston skirt clearance.

I'm thinking about getting a high mileage SC for a driver, time trialer and
future club racer.  I have some questions for those "in the know".

I've heard that '78s (and '79s too?) have bigger valves than the later ('80
+) SCs?  If so, is this any advantage performance wise?

Did all SCs have electronic speedo's?

If I find one that needs to be made back to smog legal -- has anyone tried
putting the 3.2L Carrera exhaust on (with the 3 way cat)?  (I happen to have
one of these)

I've heard the 3.0L motors are incredibly durable (I had no probs w/ my '79)
and good for 250K+ miles if given moderate care, but when the motors are in
the 150K+ mile range, are the valve trains getting weak?  Is freshening up
the top end a good idea for hard use?

Any particular advantages or disadvantages for any of the model years?

Lastly, how competitively are SCs classed for PCA club racing (I don't have
a rule book...).  As in, are all SCs, Carreras, C2s in the same stock class?
(or some such bad luck..).

Thanks for any and all help...

I did basically the same thing a few years ago when I was a new
944 owner.  I had the car parked in a friends driveway during
a ski trip.  During the middle of my vacation I went out to the
car and started it (temperature approx 25 Deg F) to "make sure
everything was OK" It started fine, and I let it idle for about
a minute and then shut it off.  About 4 days later when I was 
trying leave Colorodo for Houston  :(   the car wouldnt start at
all, it just kept cranking till the battery died.  

After half an hour or so of frenzied troubleshooting I pulled the 
spark plugs and found (much to my relief) that they were totally 
fouled with goop and soaked with gasoline.  I dried the plugs off 
and blew air into the plug openings and let the car sit for a while
to allow any gasoline in the cylinders to evaporate.  I put the
plugs back in and the car started up with difficulty and sputtered
along for a while until it warmed up, but ran fine after that.

I had always assumed that this problem was some combination of 
improper treatment (not letting the engine fully warm up) and a 
confused engine computer pumping way too much gas into the engine. 
I had never heard of the oil depletion theory till I read Johns 
message, but there could be somthing to it since I remember having
some trouble starting the car even after drying out the cylinders.

I have an 86 911 that has a blower motor in the luggage compartment for
moving air over A/C coils to aid in cooling. The blower is near the battery,
which has leaked on the plastic blower housing. The motor I have is good, but
it needs a new housing. Porsche only sells the whole assembly. The plastic
housing comes in two parts made by BEHR. If anyone has an assembly that has
been replaced due to a bad motor, I would like to aquire the plastic housing
to place my good motor into.

          Porsche part # for entire assembly = 911.624.013.01

   What do you mean "hot" idle?  The motor currently idles consistently @
   900rpm.  The only time the idle varies from 900rpm is after I have driven
   aggressively for an extended period of time.  Then the idle goes up to
   about 1100rpm but eventually settles down to 900rpm again. If my pressure
   sensor is bad would I necessarily be experiencing an erratic idle or any
   other "performance" anomalies?

I edited your message, the second question was later, but I think they go

spend the additional $10K premium that one pays for a good Cabriolet to

Don't see why not.  Did this on my dad's '80 Rabbit with no problems, and the
hardest part was getting the old insert out (the cap was a little the worse
for several season's exposure to salt-impregnated slush).  Just remove the
spring, clamp the bottom in a vice, get a BFW and crank on it.  Actually, since
you've probably taken care of your car, a "regular" wrench is most likely
adequate.

Be sure to *carefully* mark the alignment adjusting bolts (punch a mark on
the bolt and a corresponsing mark on the strut mounting flange), unless you
were planning to get the car realigned anway...

Subject: 914 wheel bearings

 
Tommy (Wmson) asked about replacing wheel bearings.
 
If the bearing is loose, try adjusting it first before giving up and
replacing it. This is a lot easier. Jack wheel up, take off wheel, pry off
hub cab (the REAL hub cap, little domed thingie in center of hub). Inside
you will find a largish nut, probably held by a cotter pin and tab washer or
in many (Most? All?) Porsche applications by a teardrop-shaped special clamp
with an Allen head screw in the side. To remove play in wheel bearing,
GENTLY tighten this nut or clamp (if clamp, an Allen wrench in the loosened
socket head screw serves as a handy handle). You want it just snug enough so
that you can move the large flat thrust washer under the nut or clamp with a
large screwdriver, with some drag. You don't want it loose, you don't want
it clamped down tight. Actually, it's really not much more than finger tight.
Once this drag has been set, tighten the clamping
screw or install a cotter pin and tab washer, put some grease around the
area, and pound the hub cap back on. Install wheel and see if that doesn't
reduce the play.
 
If you really truly need new wheel bearings, they're cheap enough. Don't
forget to buy the grease seal too. You could pound them out by going around
the rings with a hammer and screwdriver, but this is very likely to nick the
bores in the hub, and give you problems later on (rapid wheel bearing wear; new
bearings are no longer held perfectly circular due to defects gouged
into hub). It's a lot safer to find a piece of brass rod to use as
a drift, instead of the hardened blade of a screwdriver. Brass is far less
likely to mar the bearing bores. When reinstalling new bearings, first wipe
out all the old grease, press bearings back in (here you may have to
improvise to make a puller using threaded rod and something like large
sockets or perhaps the old outer ring to use partway, before it too gets
pressed in; best way is still a proper bearing press). Once assembled, the
big nut is tightened up fairly firmly to set the bearings, then backed off
all the way, then the "finger tight" method used for adjusting.
 
Whatever grease you use, try to get all of the old stuff out. Some greases
are incompatible with others (it is said that factories often use
sulfur-based grease which is incompatible with moly-based grease etc.) I
figure as far as brand, grease is grease. Front wheel bearings seem to last
a long time no matter what you put in there, as long as it's a proper wheel
bearing grease and there's enough of it.

Subject: First Turbos

 
Bob Joyce mentions the superchargers used on Auburn/Cord/Duesenbergs. These
are a completely different animal from turbocharging. The first production
automotive _turbos_ were definitely GM units.
 
Superchargers are mechanically driven by the engine, by means of gears or
shafts or belts. Turbochargers are driven by exhaust gases. This is often
erroneously described as "free energy" from the otherwise wasted exhaust
gas. This is not entirely true, but mechanically driven superchargers use up
a lot of the engine's output directly.
 
Turbocharging was invented by a Swiss engineer, Alfred Buechi, in 1905. He
used axial blowers, and applied the idea to large industrial engines.
 
The idea of supercharging is a little bit older, if you include crankcase
compression and the like. Gottlieb Daimler had some patents for crankcase
compression type supercharging in 1885 and 1889, but may not have built
actual engines using the idea.
 
The first actual superchargers were vane-type blowers, similar in concept to
the still available Paxton blower. This idea goes back to 1588, an Italian
inventor, Agostino della Tresia. The Wittig blower, with blades free to fly
out and rub against the housing, appeared in Germany
around 1900. A Swiss engineer named Zoller developed a similar vane blower
with restrained blades for a Fiat rotary two-stroke aircraft engine around
1912. The idea of the Roots blower goes back to a German inventor,
Pappenheim, around 1636. This idea was developed by a couple of brothers from
Indiana, Philander (great name!) and Francis Roots, in 1848. Their air pumps
were sold around the world for ventilation in mines and moving industrial
air and gases and such. The first recorded use of a Roots blower on an
internal combustion engine is a two-stroke V4 aircraft engine built by N.E.C.
in Engand, 1911.
 
While Buechi used axial flow turbines, the idea of centrifugal compressors
was already known. The world's first working gas turbine engine was built in
France in 1903 and used a 3-stage centrifugal compressor. This prinicple was
adapted by an American engineer, Sanford Moss, working for General Electric,
and eventually resulted in the turbocharger in much the form that we know it
today. Moss and associates were testing turbocharged aircraft at altitude by
1919.
 
The first recorded use of mechanical supercharging on a car is a Chadwick,
1907, for their racing program, and was first used in the Giants' Despair
hillclimb in Pennsylvania, 1908. This was a vane-type blower. By 1912 several
companies in Europe had begun to experiment with various types of
supercharging, most notably Hispano-Suiza. Both sides in World War I
experimented with superchargers to allow aircraft to reach higher altitudes.
The only ones to be released for service were German AEG G IV bombers powered
by Daimler-Benz engines with three-stage blowers, released for service in
August 1918.
 
The first ever use of a Roots blower on a car was by Mercedes-Benz, October
1919, on a modified Mercedes sleeve-valve (Knight patent) engine. In the
1920s, Roots blowers became fairly common on high performance and racing
cars including the aforementioned products of Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg.
 
The best history of supercharging and turbocharging I've ever found is in
Automobile Quarterly, vol 9 no.2, by Karl Ludvigsen. The above information
comes from that article.

I have to agree with others on the forum that putting one of these on is a
pretty radical step. Unless you have a lot of patience and engineering skill
to redesign aftermarket stuff to work properly, it's likely that you won't
be happy with the results. No reflection on Paxton or anybody, just personal
experience with the general level of aftermarket kludge solutions.
 
Bottom line is, move to a lower altitude, suffer with lack of power, or go
get a factory turbo- or supercharged car.

I got a good deal on it- drove it home yesterday. It is pretty clean, needs
several small things though, which is why it was cheap. I don't think it
ever had rust repaired- it is much cleaner than the '73 that I had in '80 !
It even has a nice Momo steering wheel, Bursch muffler, Yoko 008R tires
on the Fuchs forged wheels (best), so its almost ready for autocross!
Needs some work and a good tune-up (sat for a while in a garage).
Has only 103,000 miles I think. It's a late '73 model (June). 
Camshaft was replaced a few years ago, so engine should be OK.

I could be convinced to part with it so I can afford to get my 911
back up to speed. I could sell it as it is for WELL under $4000.

There's lots of autocrossing in the Harrisburg area, I go there a few
times a year for SCCA Pro Solo and Divisionals. Put out a note on the
Pfiles list and someone from that area will get in touch with you.

The 914/2.0 is about the best car in C-Stock, and can run at a lowered
ride height this year again. The only mod you need for a 914 is a bigger
front sway bar and good alignment and shocks, so they are a great
autocross car. A good driver in a 914/2.0 can usually beat most 911s
(except mine, I hope!) I think a clean 914/2.0 is a very good
investment-  the prices are now going up much faster than for 911s,
which took a killing in the late 80's. The 914 prices never dropped
because there was no speculating. Of course the 914 will feel very slow
compared to a 944 Turbo, but the handling will make up for it.

The 914 is also lots of fun on the track, but I spun-out in my '73 1.7
several times at Lime Rock (I was just a kid then...). The 914 really
rewards proper lines and driving style, since there is no way to make up
for a bad corner! And I thought my 914 brakes were at least as good as
my 911S brakes. Of course I wasn't going as fast!

The 911 is several times more expensive : rebuilding the fuel injection
on my '72 S is about the same as an engine rebuild on a 914! But if you
really want a 911, a '72-'73 911 can't be beat for fun! Any model T, E or
S is OK if it's not rusty, depends on how much you can spend.

	Just thought I'd let you know that I do plan to keep my 912E, 
gradually restoring it to original condition as I get time and money.  A 
couple of things I want to ask, did other 911s/912Es as early as '76 have 
fifteen inch "phone dial" wheels?  I thought they had either Fuchs or 
cookie cutters.  The previous owner swears they are original 
(experimental maybe??!!).  Also, would it hurt the originality if I 
installed a radio in it?  Now it has a cover over the hole that says 
Porsche.  What about boring the engine when I rebuild it? I bet its too 
worn to just re-ring it.  This might sound silly, but I don't want to 
ruin a good thing.  I also plan on doing the work myself except for the 
engine rebuild.  Owning a 924 the past five years got me acquainted with 
auto repair! :^).  Unless I can get an outrageous price for it ($20K, and 
I doubt anyone would pay that much) I plan to keep it in my garage for a 
long time.  Thanx a lot!

It is important to understand that vacuum leaks per se will not cause a
914 (or any other Bosch D-Jetronic car) to run too rich or lean. A simple
vacuum leak will just cause the car to idle too fast. The throttle is
nothing but a big "vacuum leak", controlled by your foot. There are some
electronic sensors on the throttle. but those are for 2nd order effects.

A vacuum leak in the pressure sensor will cause the engine to run rich, 
as George says. However, the reason is that the air flow through the
hose to the sensor, caused by the vacuum leak, causes the sensor to
see less vacuum than actually exists in the manifold, and this reduced
vacuum causes extra gas to be injected when it is not actually needed.

Note that this differs considerably from almost any other fuel metering
system, in that with all (?) others, excess air caused by a leak causes
lean operation.

In this case, however, the factory specified a paint that had a high zinc

Unless Prestone's recently changed packaging, the yellow containers DO 
have phosphates in them; grey does not.  Prestone claims the regular 
(w/ phosphates) fluid is OK for aluminum engines, and I've successfully 
used it for 12 years in various all aluminum and aluminum/iron 
head/block combinations with no visible problems within the water tracks.

But that's not science, and if you've got a warranty on your new car 
then stick to the specified fluids.  You wouldn't want them to make you 
pay $$$ for a water pump because you saved $5 on Prestone!

Subject: Re: 912E #1 update:gonna keep it!

Jay,

For most old 911s/12s one can do anything their heart desires. There
are enough examples around that modifying a car to suite your own taste
is simply a personal decision. VIN #0001 and motor #0003 does
distinguish your 912E. If you feel VIN #0001 is special you should not
do anything to compromise originality. In fact, you would actually have
a responsibility to do everything carefully and correctly (which also
means the initial cost will likely be higher).

Removal of the radio plate to install a radio might seem to be no
problem, but what about the installation of brakets to mount the new
radio and what about the speakers? You could replace the original door
pannels to reinstall if the car was ever to be restored to it's
original condition (radio/speakers removed) but then those pannels
would age differently than the rest of the interior. A compromise would
be to locate and install a radio consistent with those shipped with
912Es.

You must contact PCNA and at least get the Cardex for your car. They
will give you a certificate of authenticity. It is likely the #1 VIN
will get you a little more attention than normal. PCNA should
know what wheels were shipped on your 912E. I would also encourage you
to have the car appraised by an expert in Porsche body work. If the car
is unhacked upon and does not have hidden rust, then the #1 VIN becomes
more important.

Your car maybe smoking due to valve guides. Your cylinders and pistons
could very likely be reuesd. There are alternates to new cylinders and
pistons, especially for cars that will not be raced or driven
competitively. Again, an expert would be useful when the engine is
dismantled. But the longer you drive it when it's wrong, the more
likely you will have to spend even more $$$ when you do go for the
overhaul.

On the other hand, if you feel your 912E is really just the same as all
the others out there, then you should make whatever changes you wish.
 Just disreagrd the VIN and have fun!. You own it and you can make
 whatever changes suit your fancy. Ignore the VIN (its only a id number
 after all) and do it your way.

What to do with an old 911/12 is a bit of a dilema. You may think your
modification/upgrade is really clever and attractive... and the next
person may think you have seriously devalued the car. The longer one
plans to keep a car, the more radically one can change it with
disregard to any economic consequences. If you keep it original you may
not enjoy it as much, but you have preserved the value of the car in
the open market.

My advice would be to spend your money getting the car in tip top
mechanical shape. I would use only Porsche parts ($$$) and deviate from
the original enginnering only in cases wehere upgrades are widely
excepted by the Porsche community (For instance tensioner upgrades, or
replacement of the hydroneumatic front suspension on 2.0 and 2.4 liter
911Es, or SS heat exchanges). Spending money for a radio when the car
is smoking does not make sense to me. The PO of my car installed a
$1700 stereo on a car with extraordinary play in the valve guides, a
clutch worn almost to the rivets, a broken odometer, a failed MFI unit,
eight year old tires with good tread but hard as rocks and a rusted
through heat exchanger... go figure.

Enjoy your new Porsche!

Subject: Re: 914 wheel bearings



Just a word of caution on wheel bearings

914 bearings if loose are probably well worn, before tightening you 
should really check whether they are fit for purpose.

This involves removing the hub and inspecting the rollers and races, if 
you see any signs of reddish metal or bits of chrome missing you need to 
replace them. 

If you just tighten up worn bearings you can expect possibly high wear or 
far worse, a seizure - this will probably shear the stub axle and perhaps 
cause an accident.

Personal preference I prefer bearings slightly loose rather than risk too 
tight - you get slight brake knock-off but less risk of seizure.

If there is any evidence of bearing destruction, always replace the 
grease as it will contain bits of old chrome that will nack your new 
bearings.

All the places near the track are trashy, unless you are willing to spend

I don't know of any official PCA presence, but I'll be willing to bet that
Alwin Springer and his group are there to support.  Don't plan on getting
any freebies just because you are a PCA member or a Porsche owner...

I did happen to hear that a couple of PCA members will be driving a 993

Bring raingear, just in case.  Be prepared for any type of weather.

When you want to leave the track Saturday evening (to get some sleep) plan

inside the track are terrible.

Bring a radio, so that you can hear what's happening around the course.

Bring lots of money for the terrible track food. :-)

Take notes and post them when you get to a terminal... :-)

Take your camera and lots of film.

If you get a chance to stand on the high bank in front of the grandstand, do
it.  The angle is impressive...

Help.  I am trying to correct a problem with my right turn signal indicator.

I purchased a 1972 914 1.7 in September of last year.  I have been going
through it doing minor work from years of neglect.  Here is my problem-

When you engage the right turn signal, the park lights blink as normal but
the right turn signal indicator in the tack dial does not blink nor light
up.  Also when the hand brake is applied, the parking brake and oil temp
light in the gasoline guage dial blinks.  This blinking stops when the engine
is running.  The flasher relay is clicking both when the right turn signals
are blinking and when the parking brake/oil temp lights blink.

I have done the following:
  Replaced the flasher relay with original equip. type
  Checked the indicator bulb and bulb holder contact with ground
  Checked and cleaned the parking light contacts both front and rear
  Replaced the turn signal switch on the steering column.  (The old switch
     had a broken cancel mechanism)
  Put voltmeter on the right indicator when the right turn signals are blinking
  no voltage present when the park lights blink nor when not blinking.

I think the previous owner altered some connections behind the Tack dial to
stop the seat belt buzzer from operating when the seat belts are not connected.

I noted there are some leads with diodes.  Checked those and got voltage in
one direction and not the other as appropriate.  My schematic is a Haynes
manual and it is not very clear as to the connections.

Has anyone had this problem?
Could anyone tell me the proper connections for the signal lights?
Could I run the right indicator light connection to the terminal from the
  emergency flasher which connects the signal flasher relay to the turn
  signals?
There is a gray wire in the wiring harness that just terminates without a
connection.  I don't know if that is correct or what?  Help.

I'm sure you're correct Dave. I should have called them "alloy" cases.
Although I've always suspected that they contained a fair amount of magnesium
due to the way they burn-bright white, very hot and difficult to extinguish.
I've not seen aluminum, unless finely divided, exhibit these characteristics.

Dave:

I have a similiar problem with my sunroof also; the front of the roof fits
perfect however the rear won't come up flush with the rest of the roof. Ever
since I've had the car the roof hasn't aligned perfectly but it has been
worse since I had new outer seals installed....I don't think it's the seals,
the motor doesn't appear to have a lot of strength.

In any case if you find out what is wrong with your roof I'd sure like to
find out as it might fix my problem also

Tom,
When the injection nozzle drops (as opposed to squirts) gas into the venturi,
it is an indication that your accelerator pump is not working correctly. 
When there is volume the injector squirts, when there isn't enough
volume you get the drops.

When you disassembled the carbs you didn't mention changing the plunger or
diaphram.  My guess is this is your problem.  You need to rebuild the
accelerator pump.

Spark Plugs to use:  Bosch W225T7 
(if you can find them - Maestro do you have any?)

Subject: Engine Stand Adapters


I'm sure I posted this last week, but I am equally sure I
haven't seen it in the digests I've received.  So if this
is a duplicate posting, sorry...


Someone asked whether one could use a garden variety 
engine stand on a 911.  Yup.  No sweat.

You do need to make four little adapter gizmos that 
"compensate" for the ridge machined into the 911 
case where the transmission bolts on, but that takes 
about ten minutes.  There isn't enough flat space 
there for the arms of the engine stand to rest on, 
so you have to make flat space with the adapters.  
As usual, it's one of those things that's easy to 
do, but hard to describe.  The "adapter" is 
essentially a piece of aluminum, about 1'2" thick 
and 1" in diameter, with a hole drilled through the 
middle through which the mounting bolt goes.  One 
face of the "adapter" is cut down (you can use a 
file) to accomodate the ridge

I'm happy to send one to you to look at, actually 
faxing or mailing a drawing would be easier.

	William,  From what I understand of this conversion the roll bar 
(targa band?) will unbolt from the body, no need to cut it off.  If the 
conversion was done properly the needed renforment panels should have 
been welded in.  I don't remember where but you can obtain a manual that 
covers such a conversion.  If you can get it perhaps you could check to 
see if the renforments were installed.

	Hope this helps.      TP

Subject:       Autox and understeer

Ladies and Gentlemen, I am pleased to announce the successful
completion of  PCA Golden Gate Region's first 1995 autocross.

On January 22nd ten cars and fourteen drivers gathered together at
the Grower's Ice company in Salinas, CA for a Fun Autocross. 
Weather by and large permitted, and each driver had ten runs of
three laps each (one practice, two timed).  Top time of day (~35.3
sec) was taken by George Neidel (though it may have been his son Rob,
they were close...  Forgive me Rob, if I erred).

Most notable was the gentleman in the '89 C4 who placed fifth
overall.  He arrived with no helmet, no experience, and relatively
little clue.  He claimed to have never driven his 911s near their
limits (previous car was an '85), never been to a school, etc.  Beat
my best time by three seconds, and was two seconds better than some
fairly experienced drivers.  Congratulations to Ken.

My memory of the event is primarily of understeer (in a 911).  The
course was short, with two hairpins, which I did my best to
straighten by zealous cone rearrangement.  As we were packing up, one
of the other drivers said that low front tire pressure may have
caused some of my understeer.

I've been running with the factory recommended air pressure
(29F/32R)--is this too low?  Hank Watts (in his execeedingly cogent
work "Secrets of Solo Racing"), says 35-42 psi is the optimum range.
 However he's talking about race tires, and I'm running Bridgestone
RE71s (205/60VR15 on 6" wheels).  Should I put some more air in
there next time, or are the higher pressures only for sticky rubber?

Breathlessly awaiting the net.wisdom

Subject: '73 914 2.0 fuel injection

P-philes,

As a 914 newby with a lemon (no, not the color) original '73 914 2.0, I
attempted this weekend to tackle rough idle for about 60 sec. followed by
stalling. Starting the engine is never a problem. Armed with Haynes and the
914 Handbook (factory manuals are on back order forever) I gave myself a
crash course in D-jetronic.
Step 1. Get familiar with the major components and their location
Step 2. Check all the vacuum lines. Aha ! some clever mechanic interupted the
vacuum line from the airfilter to the auxiliary air regulator. Clever job too
as he just cut the line and rejoined with a wood stick. From this point on,
it was fair to assume that the auxiliary regulator was shot.
Step 3. The idle adjusting screw was in ALL the way. Probably to correct for
2.
Step 4. On initial engagement of the ignition key, the fuel pump can be
heard.
Step 5. With the ignition key on, moving the air intake valve results in
happy clicking of the injectors. So the throttle valve sensor is likely OK.
Step 6. Since I can start but not accelerate, and since idle stals after 1-2
min, I looked at the head temperature sensor. It is supposed to offer high
resistance when cold. I disconnected the sensor (infinite resistance) and now
the engine kept running. Very rich and at about 1500 rpm. Going full throttle
and back is not a problem, so the deceleration valve may be OK. Points look
OK. Upon restarting the engine logically floods.

Summary, my main problems right now are a defective auxiliary air regulator
(do they routinely break or should I just check whether there is 12V on its
line ? Resistance is close to 0 Ohm and the manual states 30 Ohm although my
mini multimeter only reads in 1K increments) and a defective head temperature
sensor.

Am I logical so far or did I miss something major. This is my first weekend
with D-Jetronic...

I looked at catalogs from Stoddard, AJ, Automotion, Performance Products,
Tweeks and Automobile Atlanta. The following points:
1. There is a VERY wide variety in who offers what.
2. Prices are all over the book. Ex. '73 2.0 Auxiliary air regulator:
     Tweeks: NA
     Performance Products: Rebuilt $41.50
     Automobile Atlanta : New $295, Used $125
     AJ Racing : $272.67
     Stoddard: $90.16
                                                              Head
temperature sensor
     Tweeks : $19.50
     Performance Products: $19.95
     Automotion: $17.95
     Automobile Atlanta: $28.00

Has anyone any better ideas ? Do I NEED the auxiliary air regulator for
anything else but starting ?

All help and comments welcome..

Subject: Heel-n-Toe vs. Double-Clutch

        Someone talked about heel-and-toe technique vs. double-
clutching.  Can't you do both?
        Right before you finish braking, clutch in, take car out
of gear, clutch out, blip throttle (heel & toe!), clutch in, may-
be blip throttle again, put car in gear, clutch out, finish
braking, turn in, stomp on it.  (Well, in a 914 you stomp on it;
not enough torque to break me loose in most spots.)
        Double-clutching is evidently nicer to your tranny and
maybe your clutch than just clutch-and-grind, but it takes longer.
But, as John Byrne pointed out to me, how much time are you gain-
ing, vs. how much damage are you doing to your car?  Now I shift
slower.

        What he said.  I've done this once on my car, once on a competi-

cotter pins, though, it has the Allen screw on the big clamp nut.  One
word:  better too loose than too tight, but "some drag" means a lot more
drag to some folks than to me.  My first set was too loose (just barely
acceptable) so I got the second set to where I could move the washers with
some difficulty.  Not "just barely", but not "some drag".
        This may just be a problem with me, 'cause my first valve adjust
(on a Honda) I set the valves *WAY* too loose--"some drag" again.

Subject: Ref: 24 Hours @ Daytona

John,

I work directly across the street from the track.  Although I have never
attended the race, I usually attend the time-trials during lunch.  

>>- when is the best time to arrive? I have plenty of time & can arrive 
>>several days early so if there are practice sessions etc worth seeing...

As I said, I normally go over for the practice & time trials on Thursday &
Friday.  There is a stock car museum at the track and a Corvette museum
about a mile away on the other side of I-95.  It has only been open for 6
months or so.  It is supposed to have a few old Porsche racers, but I have
not been in it to verify that fact.  And of course, there is the beach,
which is usually too cold for we FL wimps anyway.  But it is interesting to
note that where the racing used to be held before the built the speedway.  

>>- where is the track? I've checked an admittedly bad map of Daytona but 
>>can't see anything looking like a road racing circuit on it.

The race is held a the Daytona International Speedway.  It has an infield
track that is added to the high-speed oval for the 24 hours.  The Speedway
is on International Speedway Blvd (Rt 92) about 1 mile east of I-95.  

>>- do I need a ticket to get in? If so, how much & where do I buy them? 
>>Also, is there pit access before or during the race?

The tickets for the time trials are $4-$5 per day.  You can buy a ticket
for the race at the gate for a grandstand seat- I have been told - for
about $10-20.  The Infield tickets go for about $50-60 (if my memory serves
me).  

>>- where to stay near the track? 

At that time of the year you can stay down on the beach for a very
reasonable rate.  I stayed at the Sunny Shore Motel 6 years ago when I
moved down here - it is a modest but clean place right on the ocean.  Its
number is 904 252 4569.  It has several efficiencies.  

If you want to call the travel agent my University uses, call 800 252 0516
and ask for Susan.  She is a very honest and effective person (who knows
the area) and would get you a good deal.   


>>I'm looking for an inexpensive & safe place to park my car while I'm there.

I park my 77 911 in the Martin-Marietta lot right across fro the track
every day.  The 24 hour race is not an overwhelming event like the stockcar
races, so you should not have a problem finding a safe place to park.  

>>- is there a PCA or PCNA presence at the event - a guest enclosure 
>>or hospitality area?

Subject: 928 clutches


In repect to the thread about 928 clutches, they are called upon to 
launch a large, heavy object into motion from a standing start. This 
means the friction material will wear faster because it will heat from 
the work being performed.

Yes, the clutch has been revised a few times. Considering all factors, 
you should be able to get in excess of 80,000 miles (129,000Km) with 
your clutch. This will go down if you drive in bumper-to-bumper traffic 
or exclusively around town.

One nice thing about the 928, the clutch was designed so the drivetrain 
does not have to be removed as in the 924/944/968 line. Parts are 
comparable to most imports of this class. 

The 928 is a fine touring car. It has it's idyosyncracies, but it is no 
less reliable than a Jaguar or Mercedes of the same category. Just don't
refer to it as a German Corvette.

Our timing is just a little off.  Not long ago, my motor part failed.  I ended
up getting a new motor, but I did locate several assemblies in bone-yards. 
Parts Heaven had one for around $125.  Anyway, you may want to get a complete

Subject: Re: Autox and understeer

    Greetings Dirk,
    
    Hope you had fun at the autocross.  The RE71s have a very soft sidewall 
    (in comparison to BFG's or Yoko's) and need at *least* 40lbs to keep the 
    sidewalls from rolling over.  In fact, due to the construction of street 
    tires, street tires need more air pressure than race tires.  As an 
    example, my BFG 230's (205/50-15) run high speed time trials at 23lbs 
    hot with no rollover!
    
    For street construction tires,  mark the side and shoulder of your tire 
    with shoe polish in two or three places.  After a run, look at the shoe 
    polish to see where it has rubbed off.  If it has rubbed off below the 
    tread line on the tire shoulder, then you need to increase the 
    pressure. If there is still visible polish on the tread, then your 
    either not driving the car hard enough or you have too much air 
    pressure.  After you have your rollover correct, you can adjust your 
    tire pressure in small increments to affect handling.
    
    Please note this does not work with race tires.  They have very stiff 
    sidewalls that do not require air pressure to keep them upright.  Race 
    tires need a tire pyrometer to optimize pressure settings.
    
    IMHO, this is the way to begin adjusting tire pressures.  You may want 
    to join ($0.00) Team T/A at 1-800-RACE-BFG for the monthly newsletter.  
    They have alot interesting bits about tire construction and helpful 
    hints.
    
    Have fun,
    Jon

Barney, 

Is it a requirement to have a PCA license to enter a PCA race, assuming 
you are a PCA member, or can I run on my vintage license?

I know that SCCA and most vintage organizations honor each others 
licenses.  For example in the NW, SCCA honors ICSCC and SOVREN (vintage) 
licenses, as long as you are a SCCA member.  Vintage clubs who are 
members of the Vintage Motorsports Council all honor each others licenses 
for one race a year.

I live in Seattle and would love to enter the Portland race, but if I

Martin Walker asks about the aerodynamic cars built in Germany.
 
They weren't Zeppelins. Maybach had a model called a Zeppelin but it was a
huge luxury tank of a car, like a Cadillac or Lincoln of the time (or
Mercedes?) The 1921 Rumpler Tropfenwagen is regarded as one of the first
attempts at streamlining, Cd only 0.28. Later examples of the streamlining
craze are the experimental cars built by Paul Jaray, the production
Hanomag, and of course the Beetle which led to the Porsche 114 which led
to the 356 which was really just a first attempt at a 911 and there you
are...
 
Speaking of an earlier thread about turbocharging and all, Ferry Porsche
used to tool around during the war in a Beetle with a supercharged VW engine
designed, I think, for stationary use at high altitudes.

>If that doesn't start a flame war, maybe you're all asleep and I'll rejoin

Come on, now, Bob, you own a 356 and a recent 911. Admit it, now -- doesn't
the 356 feel like the "trainer" version of the 911?
356 is to 911 what AT-6 is to P-51?
 
And if you look at very early 901/911s, they're pure 356 inside. There were
356 plans that never made it into production, but which led directly
to the 911. The 356 T7 would have had a 2-liter six-cylinder with two
camshafts, stronger 4- or 5-speed transmission. A cheaper version would have
kept the 616 engine of the 356 SC, possibly in an under-floor installation.
Later there was talk of building the 356 with the six-cylinder engine
alongside the new 901/911. Or building a 1.6 or 1.8 liter engine with parts
shared with the 901.
 
There was a memo in which it was suggested that the 356 revert to a pure
2-seater, with the space under what used to be the rear seats used for a
fuel tank, a resulting bigger front trunk, and a hatchback.
 
None of these things ever came to be.
 
All of this from Conradt's 356 book, p. 160-161.

The Windblown Witness, San Diego Region PCA's newsletter, reports that
SB2050, in the California state senate, "could make it very expensive to
drive your older (pre-1990) Porsche. If you own such an older car, the state
is going to set limits on the total number of miles you can drive that car.
If you drive more, you'll be fined for the excess miles. The older the car,
the worse the penalty. The bill targets cars made between 1966 and 1979 as
the group most responsible for the high smog levels even though many of
these cars have been retrofitted with catalytic converters. If you do not
want San Diego County to act as a test case for this bill, write your
representative on the San Diego Board of Supervisors NOW! Ask them to vote
NO implementing SB2050 in San Diego as a pilot county."
 
Never mind San Diego; this is getting ridiculous. If you live in California,
write your senatecritter NOW, find out where it stands on this, and tell him
where you stand, and depending on his attitude perhaps tell him where he'll
stand next election, if you have anything to say about it.
 
This is, I think, just a thinly disguised tax. People gotta drive. If you
drive, the state wants some excuse to take more of your money. I don't think
the hidden agenda has anything to do with actually restricting miles driven.
 
This could also make a thriving market for spare speedometer/odometers.
Unless the state figures out a way to put seals on them. Swapping speedos is
no problem with most of our Porsches, but that's not the point.
 
Anyway, this has to be stopped NOW. I'll try to find the text of SB2050, but
don't know if it's online. If anybody else can help, please post it.

Peter Albrecht says "Bob Joyce mentions the superchargers used on
Auburn/Cord/Duesenbergs. These are a completely different animal from
turbocharging. The first production automotive _turbos_ were definitely GM
units...."

Peter, as I said privately to someone else who responded in a similar
fashion, the writer side of me relishes debate on the semantics of words, but
the engineer side is less enthusiastic.  There is a reason Karl Ludvigsen
titled his article "The Origins of Supercharging", rather than "The Origins
of Supercharging and Turbocharging", even though he discusses turbocharging
extensively.  Any device that pressurizes the intake side of an engine is
properly a "supercharger", whether it is driven by exhaust gases or by other
means.  Engineers refer to the latter as "superchargers" and to the former as
"turbo-superchargers".  You'll notice that Ludvigsen uses the terms
"turbosupercharger" and "turbocharging" frequently in his article
(particularly on pages 189-197), but always correctly in the broad context of
supercharging.  He makes it clear that turbines driven by exhaust gases are
just another means to an end.  I suspect (though I certainly can not confirm)
the term "turbocharger" was dreamed up in some marketing maven's office,
rather than in an engineering department.  So, no, Pete, they are not
completely different animals: one is simply a subset of the other.

I agree completely with you on Ludvigsen's article.  Like everything else he
has done, this one is first-rate.

Also, I want to thank you for your contribution to English-language Porsche
literature.  The translation of Conradt's "356 Porsche" is outstanding, and
certainly makes the book widely available to an appreciative audience.

Actually, it is, Tom.  The accelerator pumps do not dispense a "mist" but
instead put out a distinct "stream" if the pedal is depressed sharply.  If
you depress it with less enthusiasm, you'll get "drops".  Probably nothing
unusual here.  Get a calibrated vial (a plugged diabetic syringe minus its
plunger works well for this) and catch the output from each pump.  I don't

the culprit spark plug missing the tip which threads on and touches the plug
wire.  However, I continued to have my inherent problem..the engine runs fine
when cold. Once it reaches operating temp, though, the engine can't hold an
idle at very low speed or a stop, and the engine chokes at anything other
than a very light, steady application of the throttle.  I believe it is the
failed O2 sensor (which has been reset) or perhaps the cold start fuel
switch.  Whatever the case, I took the car to a reputable shop here in
Columbus.  The senior mechanic advised me that the intake boots had to be
replaced.  Well, he did that, but the problem persists.  Any suggestions?

 BILL NUMBER: SB 2050	CHAPTERED  09/30/94
	BILL TEXT

INTRODUCED BY  Senator Presley
   (Principal coauthors:  Assembly Members Goldsmith and
Richter)

	LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
   SB 2050, Presley.  Air pollution:  vehicles.
   (1) Existing law authorizes each air pollution control
district and air quality management district to modify its
emission reduction strategy if the State Air Resources Board
makes a specified finding.
   This bill would require the districts and the state board,
for that purpose, to take into account specified district and
state programs.
   The bill would require the San Diego County and Ventura
County Air Pollution Control Districts, in their triennial plan
review, to determine the target pollution miles per vehicle, as
defined, and to reduce that figure by 5% annually.
   The bill would require a decal disclosing the smog index, as
defined, for each vehicle, as determined by the state board, to
be affixed to a new motor vehicle, except as specified, prior to
the sale or registration of the vehicle.  The bill would
require certain information to be affixed to a used motor
vehicle offered for sale by a dealer.
   (2) Existing law requires the state board to adopt emission
standards for used motor vehicles.
   This bill would authorize the Bureau of Automotive Repair to
develop and make available to the public a list of maintenance
practices designed to improve a motor vehicle's operating
efficiency, and would provide for reduction of the vehicle's
smog index if a test shows that emissions are reduced.
   The bill would require the Department of Consumer Affairs to
develop a program to certify emissions retrofit devices, as
defined.
   These provisions would become inoperative upon a specified
finding by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   (3) Existing law defines "low-emission motor vehicle" for
certain purposes in state law.
   This bill would include in that definition a vehicle that has
been modified by the use of an emissions retrofit device.
   (4) Existing law requires the test at smog check stations to
include specified items and establishes criteria for smog check
stations to issue a certificate of compliance or a certificate
of noncompliance.
   This bill would establish additional criteria for the
issuance of those certificates based on the target pollution
miles of a motor vehicle, and for the issuance of odometer
certificates of noncompliance.  The bill would require the
Bureau of Automotive Repair to develop a program to biennially
inspect motor vehicle odometers at smog check stations, and to
notify the smog check stations of the target pollution miles, as
specified.  The bill would, in the San Diego County and Ventura
County Air Pollution Control Districts, require the test at
smog check stations to include determinations relating to the
odometer and target pollution miles, and would require a smog
check after one year if the prescribed mileage is exceeded.  The
bill would require the bureau to provide for a test of the
extent to which vehicles exceed expected test levels of ozone
precursors.
   (5) The bill would require the state board to establish a
repair subsidy program and an emissions credit exchange program,
as specified.
   (6) Existing law authorizes a district to levy a specified
fee on motor vehicle registrations.
   This bill would authorize the San Diego County and Ventura
County Air Pollution Control Districts to increase that fee by
$1 to implement the pilot program established by the bill.  The
bill, except for that fee increase authority, would not become
operative until the districts have sufficient funds to implement
the pilot program, as specified.
   (7) The bill would impose a state-mandated local program by
imposing new duties on the districts, and by changing the
definition of a crime relating to pollution control equipment of
vehicles.
  (8) The California Constitution requires the state to
reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs
mandated by the state.  Statutory provisions establish
procedures for making that reimbursement.
   This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by
this act for specified reasons.
   (9) The bill, except as specified, would not become operative
until a specified system for the electronic filing of
certificates of compliance or noncompliance is determined by the
Department of Consumer Affairs to be operational, as specified,
and, except as specified, would become inoperative 5 years from
its operative date and would be repealed on the January 1
following that inoperative date

Subject: Are Early 930s Grenades?

I'm so confused.  Are 1976 and 1977 3.0 930 cars set up like NASCAR
qualifyers?

I just got my new PML and I see a couple of '76 930s asking prices in the mid
teens.  As I am search for my 911SC coupe, I noticed these Turbo prices and
wonder why not? I love the look and don't plan to autocross (I've read about
the difficult handling with the turbos throttle lag).  The only two I've
driven were modified (bigger turbo and Lots-O-Lag) but provided huge grins
and many giggles when boosted.

The front cover article mentions small brakes and turbo failures.  Are the
brakes the same as an SC? Could they be upgraded to the 78-newer brakes or
something better yet?

Several years ago I spoke with an engineer from Garrett regarding turbo
failures, I was told the most common failures was a result of poor habits
(failure to idle the car after a run to cool down the turbochargers bearings
 - of particular concern when not water-jacketed), or poor maintenance
(infrequent oil changes or restricted air filters).

Everyone I've talked to warns me to stay away, but no one seems to have any
substantive experience, only rumor and innuendo.

Were the 3.0 engines themselves a problem with this setup?

I've read that the SC was actually the faster car.

What other problems do they have?

Do any of you have experience with an actual purchase and ownership of such a
car in recent years?

I'm not against getting oil-burners and clunkers off of the road.

What annoys me is that the definition of a "clunker" is any car that

I greatly appreciate all the suggestions and help that gets offered,
so I guess I ought to tell you how things work.

WHEN THINGS GO RIGHT

A prospective new member/transfer to-from digest/etc message is
sent to "porschephile-request@tta.com". There it gets dumped in a file
with a lot of other list admin related mail. Once a day or so, I run
a couple of pre-processing scripts on the file, stripping out the 
failed mail messages for processing by something else and leaving me with
the 12-20 *real* messages out of the 500-1200 I started with. 

I read each of them, and either reply personally, or forward it to an
automatic agent. If the person asks for a status change, like getting
digest, or dropping or whatever, they get a terse one line response
saying what has been done, a log is updated, and the thing happens.
If they're asking to join the list, they get a welcome message, a copy
of the FAQ, and a survey questionaire.

Also in this category are people who send me direct personal notes
having either developed a realationship with me over time, or having
gotten my name from someone else. These I just handle, often with a 
personal note back.

WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

Some bone-head posts to the list as a whole instead of having bothered to
READ any of the stuff mailed them when they joined as noted above. These
vermin are then solicited by Bart Chambers to READ THE FUCKING RULES
even though he's a lot more polite about it than I am. He cc's the
admin address on his note to them, and the right thing happens. 

I'm particulaly keen to drop people that misdirect their requests since
if they can't read, I have no use for them. I'm much less keen to add
people that send "please sign me up" notes to the whole world, because
the *ONLY* published address for this list is that of the admin address.
If I get a big rush of those at once, I always ask where they got the
address, then send Julio the $25 assassin after the originator of this
confusion...

So, your concerns and offers of assistence are appreciated, but things are
as they say pretty well covered...

I looked at this a great deal when I found myself in possession of a
911 targa and three late electric cab tops (complete) at the same
time once...

Near as I could tell, the cab got one or two more pieces of stiffening
than the targa from '83-85, then from '86 on it was the same tub.
So given that you're not talking about an exceptionally stiff car
to begin with, I'm inclined to believe that it's not that greatly
compromised. It's not the roll bar that makes it stiffer nearly so
much as some of the other stuff welded in. 

On the other hand, I'd personally want a good roll bar in my cab before
I put it on the track (even though the PCRs says you don't have to do
this if the car is stock).

My decision? I sold the tops for a net of about $10k. MUCH smarter than
hacking up my car...

Subject: Re: 356 Questions

Dear Tom:

          Your Zenith Carbs may suffer from a worn acc pump diaphragm (or one
that has been replaced with an inferior red rubber gizmo instead of the
Original Leather). This can cause low flow to the nozzles. Also, the
injection nozzles are rather small and need to be blown out exceedingly
thorougly. Make sure the WD-40 comes out of the nozzles in a strong stream-
and blow in both directions.  Also- the adjustment rod can be
lenghtened/shortened to adjust the volume of fuel from the acc pump nozzles.
And note that there are THREE positions that you can attach the top of the
vertical rod to. As you progress inward, the volume injected goes up. If you
have the vertical rod on the hole furthest out, try moving it in to the
middle position. Then measure the amount of fuel ejaculating from the acc
pump nozzle. (Though you need a special calibrated collector to do this, it
can be made from an eyedropper in a pinch.)
     Incidentally, if you have a Super Carb, you should have 220 Air
Correction Jets (the big brass ones as viewed when looking down inside the
big hole in the top of the carb).  Looking further down the hole at the
venturis, you should see a "28" cast into them. (Normals have 24mm Venturis
with 230 Air Correction Jets and C's have 210 Air Correction Jets with 28mm
Venturis.
     As to plugs, I like Bosch  W5AC's on an Unknown Engine (they're
NON-extended tip so have the greatest chance of not being hit by a piston).
On engines I know (or have built), I like the Bosch W6BC's, with the extended
tip. On Super-90's I like the W225T-7 plugs, but they're exceedingly rare
these days, so I only use them on Super-90's.

 KEEP THE 356 FAITH!

Bill Van Bibber asked, ". . . what are the opinions of you racers out there on 
the various driving schools?" 
 
While I'm not a racer and I haven't been to any of the other schools for 
comparison, I did take the three day Russell Racing School "Techniques of 
Racing" course last winter at Laguna Seca and had the time of my life! 
 
The Formula Fords seemed to be very well-maintained, there was a lot of seat 
time, and by the end of the three days all thirteen people in the class were 
lapping Laguna Seca with confidence and steadily lowering their lap times . . 
. in the rain! 
 
While I was definitely in the slower half of the class, that didn't diminish 
the excitement or the feeling of accomplishment when I finally found the grove 
and knocked a dramatic 10 seconds off my best lap time to that point. 
 
There's nothing like having your instructor standing at the start-finish line 
applauding to make you feel like a million dollars! 
 
I would heartily recommend the experience to anyone who has even the slighest 
interest in racing . . . for the pure fun of it if for no other reason. 
 
By the way, upon successful completion of the course all you need to do to is 
join SCCA ($55) and pass the physical to be eligible to obtain your SCCA 
Regional ($45) or National ($100) Competition License.

and he's right, they *are* completely different animals.  Rephrase Pete's 
comment this way: "The superchargers used on A/C/D are completely different 
animals than the superchargers used on the GM cars"

As I noted privately to someone who shall remain forever anonymous (Bob Joyce),
the difference between the mechanically driven supercharger and the exhaust
gas driven supercharger is *quite* significant.  Perhaps I didn't make the
point adequately clear to my learned, but anonymous correspondent.  The 
significance is that the switch to turbocharging made, for the first,
all the attendant blessings of supercharging to the hoards of the unwashed 
(well, me for instance).  Prior to GM's introduction of the Buick/Olds in '62
(OK, I still remember it as '61, but what can I say?), supercharging was only 
found on *Big* ticket items not available to the hoi-polli (e.g., MBz 500 K 
series, "Blower" Bentleys, A/C/D...you get the picture).

Today, thanks to the pioneering efforts of General Bullmoose, turbos can be 
found within the reach of nearly everyone.  Now ask, where can you buy a 
(mechanically driven) supercharger?

Now *that* is wisdom, but what would one expect from a man with the class,

And worse, other states look to CA to decide what legislation to
adopt.

For example, a bunch of New England states (incl. my state, the
Peoples Republic of Massachusetts) have decided to adopt California's
air-cleanliness rules soon.

There will be no such thing as a 49-state car anymore...

Those of you looking at the problem legislation mentioned in the
previous messages and saying "Good thing that isn't happening here"
better think again.  If it goes over in CA, it is likely to be seen in
other states soon.

As Peter Albrecht suggests, I wish there was an NRA for motorists...

We have been looking for a new 'family van' and found the Toyota Previa

If you were asking where you can buy a car that comes equiped with a 
mechanically driven supercharger then one answer is that the Volkswagon 
Corrodo (sp?) came equiped with a belt driven scroll compressor 
supercharger. I use the past tense because Im not sure if it is still

======================
Kristian:
	when I first bought my 944, I also had a very hard rattle when I went
over a bump on the road. I would shake the whole steering wheel. It turned
out to be a bad strut. It had leaked all its fluid and was not working!

Easy way to check would be to look around the strut/spring/hub for signs of
wetness/embedded dirt. Also you can bounce the offending corner up/down
to check the strut.

You could also have have bad ball joints. I think in your car, they are 
removed by drilling pop rivets out and using bolts for the new ones.

One more thing to check, would be the upper strut bearing. THis is where the
strut mounts to the body. They have some needle bearings and a rubber mount.

I changed all those parts on my car. Big difference!
Hope this helps...

When the VW Corrado was first announced - around 2-3 years ago, an option
for the v6 engine was a trick combination supercharger. I recollect that
it used both a belt and exhaust gas drive, the idea being to get better
low revs torque from the belt, then benefit from the turbo at higher revs. 

I don't know if they ever went production on that jobby.

        I know that this isn't an *automotive* use for them, but I
recall from my researches into WWII aircraft (especially fighters)
that many used a "Turbo-supercharger" to get adequate high-altitude
performance.  Not sure if it was exhaust-driven, but that's what
they called 'em.
        They also had the "dial-a-boost" feature that you can find
in some aftermarket Turbo set-ups.

Never heard of anything like that, but for the first two years of the
Corrado's production, it was available in the U.S. *only* with a 1.8 liter
G60 (G-lader supercharger, 60mm diameter) motor. The 8V motor made just
over 150bhp, but was later dropped completely in favor of the much nicer
VR6 motor. In Europe, a smaller version of the G-lader supercharger was/is
also available on the VW Polo.

Anyone how the G-lader differs from a Roots blower or any other type of
belt-driven sueprcharger? I don't remember the details but supposedly it's
just as efficient but without the parasitic drag of a "conventional"
blower.

Other production cars I can think of that use belt-driven superchargers:
MkI Toyota MR2, Ford Thunderbird SuperCoupe, various late-model Buicks with
3.8L motor, probably more.... no Porsches, though.

Hi, Ted.
 
Restoring wheel -- I didn't find green stuff underneath, I found gray stuff
underneath, apparently a lacquer primer, and black plastic (Bakelite?) below
that. I first built up the worn down finger ridges with epoxy, using two
brass templates (circumferential and radial) to check the profile while filing
and sanding to shape (very tedious and involved). Once the shape was correct
and smooth, I primed with a heavy coat of SEM Prime, intended for bumpers
and various plastic car bits. That was sanded down with 400 grit. Then about
8 layers of BASF R-M black acrylic lacquer with suitable thinner and the
right flash time. After overnight hardening, two more light coats with
mostly thinner. Bake in oven for a couple of hours. Polish out using 2000
grit wet sanded, and Glasurit polishing compound. Absolutely
indistinguishable from an unused wheel. It will take you about 2 solid days
of work.

Hi, Bob.
 
OK, you're right, turbochargers are a subset of all superchargers. I guess
when talking about exhaust driven superchargers, it's safe to say GM was

long before that.

correct, contemporary (and working) model to install, drilling a hole in the

restoration correctly, regardless of how it affects the convenience of 
driving the car.  I hope the expense doesn't discourage you soemwhere down

Bob Joyce correctly points out that if you work the throttle linkage too
slowly, you will just get drops, not a squirt of fuel from the accelerator
pump.
 
The syringe idea is pretty good. You can also pay some money to get an
official glass vial which you will probably drop down the throat anyway if
you don't make a little wire holder for it. Performance Products, Stoddard,
and others carry these.
 
The manual calls for a squirted volume of 0.2 to 0.3 cc, for TWO STROKES of
the accelerator, per squirter. Rapid strokes, all the way to the stop.
This applies to both the 1600 and 1600 Super. The volume is adjusted by
turning the tiny turnbuckle on the short vertical link to the accelerator pump.

Yep, bad motor mount.  Probably the one on the passenger side, by the
exhaust.


Wiggling won't show whether it is good or not.  There is a procedure in the
factory service manual, but the real test is:

1) Steering wheel shakes at idle.
2) Steering wheel stops shaking at about 1600-1800 rpm.

Fix: Replace it with the latest motor mount, about $115 new from OEM.

Tips, have someone with an alignment rack with dollies do it.  He can do it
in about an hour, if he's good.

Subject: 944 rear underbody ground connections


Poking around under the rear of my '88 944 I found two badly corroded ground 
connections, one on each side of the underbody just in front of the 
trans/diff unit.  These ground wires also have what I assume is a 
power/signal partner wire along side going to somewhere further in the rear 
of the car.  This car has 137K miles and has seen more than its fair share 
of salt - but I pamper it a little more these days.

What system do these ground connections pertain to?  Have not yet procured a 
fiche machine with which to view my recently acquired fiche manual set. 
 Haynes nearly useless.  I would not expect rear tail light wiring to be 
routed along the underbody so I'm guessing fuel pump power, trans/diff 
switches?

This car has a multi-year chronic problem of stumbling at idle and under 
acceleration in cold ambient conditions irrespective of engine compartment 
temp.  Snow has kept me from test driving since I reworked these grounds to 
see if it improved anything - it's a long shot.

Thank you to anyone's response.  Mail me direct [shaferk@indy.tce.com] and 
I'll post ONE summarized response.  Bandwidth is a terrible thing to waste.

Subject:      Water cooled. Oil light troubles...

High folks. Perhaps one of you has been down this road before and could lend
a hand. My $$931 is preserving itself quite well by leaking oil all over its
underside. It appears to be starting from that invisible point at the back of
the head where the sending unit for the oil pressure guage is located. The
guage seems to be working. The idiot light is not working. The book shows
part numbers for an oil pressure light switch and a sending unit for the guage.
Since the light is not working I suspect the switch for the light may be
the source of the oil leak. Now the tricky part: I can see (sorta) the sending
unit for the guage at the back of the head although it looks like it would be
one hell of a job to replace, but I do not see the switch for the light.
Where did they hide it?? And (b), how does one access the stuff back there
to replace it if they in fact hid it near the guage sending unit? Looks to
me like at the very least the distributor drive housing has to come off in
addition to all the usual stuff up by the firewall. Suggestions?
Please email me directly as I have not yet signed on again to the list. I
will be likely be moving to a new address soon so I have spared Stan the

As previously noted, I'm real big on making sure you pick where you're
going to play *FIRST*, then decide on how you're going to do it...
If you have 911 brakes, that probably means that you have 911 front
suspension and God only knows what sorts of other mods, which means you're
*WAY* deep in the weeds as far as being competitive. That would be an
SCCA FP autox car, or a GT-3 (with a 4) or GT-2 (with a 6) race car; for
PCA, it will depend on where you live as to how you're classed.

Bottom line, if this is your first attempt at doing things like this,
give up on two concepts: 1) having the "right stuff" and (2) being
competitive. It just won't happen. What *CAN* happen is that you'll
get a lot of seat time, learn a lot about how to drive, what other people
are doing, etc, and most importantly HAVE A LOT OF FUN!!!

> 1) Will a carbureated engine make the same amount of power as a injected
> engine?

Done right, no way in hell. Done the way most people do it, however, carbs
make more power because people either don't know how to tune FI or
won't spend the money for the right parts.

*HOWEVER*, if you're going road racing in SCCA, you must run carbs in
any class this car might be in. So you gotta figure that part out first...

> 2) Should I consider using a good running injected 1.8 that I have?

YES!!! That will get you in the car, get you some seat time, and let you
think about what you really want to do. Work on improving *YOUR* times
not on "beating people" or "buying a win". You can do that with a 
used lawnmower engine, it does NOT require a 962 under the hood...


> I have a machine shop that I can use so only the parts are a cost factror.

Sure, once you get past the skills to set things up right, etc....
Look at what people who are winning NATIONALLY do in the classes that
your interested in. And don't forget that lots of us hang out on this

Subject:      CIS/Ice Cream Machine

One other thing is getting on my nerves wrt operating a $931 during the
cold months. Under _EXTREMELY_  cold conditions, ice forms around the air
sensor plate and bogs the whole thing up in a big way. Kelvin Ross and I
had a most evil experience last winter making this discovery but that is
another [lengthy] story :-)
Anyhow, under the worst conditions, it coats the entire air filter and filter
housing right on through to the throat of the turbo with ice cream. A nasty
thought when you visualize what a freed chunk of ice could do to a turbine
at high speed.  Anybody else had this trouble? Any easy solutions?
Again, please email me directly at Ken.Stanton@QueensU.CA.
Thanks folks. Ken.

P.S. Anybody have any experience with fusion welding to repair cracked
manifolds, heads, combustion chambers, other bits and pieces? A mechanic
here tells me wonderful things about it so I am hopeful about repairing
all those cracked $931 manifolds. (The exhaust manifold was available
for the small price of about $1200 the last time I checked. _ALL_  $931's
have cracked exhaust manifolds and usually cracked intake manifolds as well.
It's just one of those lovely *features* )

The hatch switch is the same basic part as the window lift switches. No

one with no luck so I replaced it with a good condition used one.

I have the factory service manuals for the 944, but since the interior
of the early 944's are the same as the 924, one would need the 924
service manual for that. Was the cruise stalk actually unplugged and
completely removed? The steering wheel might need to be removed
to put it back together, but it is not hard to remove the wheel if you have
the right sized socket.

Good Luck with your new toy!

Yup, bad motor mounts. The dealer is way too expensive. Zim's and
Vertex have the best prices; about $120 apiece. They are in fact
hydraulically damped shock absorbers. The right hand side usually
goes first because of the exhaust heat although on my '84 with 130K
miles both were bad. An experienced mechanic with the correct tools
can do both in about 2  hours. While not technically difficult, it is not
a good first project for the budding amateur mechanic. There have

I'm a bit ambivalent here. Turbochargers and Superchargers accomplish the 
same end (raising air pressure over atmospheric) with pumping systems 
(which distinguishes them from ram-air systems), but the engineering of 
each is quite different. A supercharger typically turns at some 
ratio of engine speed, ie relatively low rpm. A turbocharger is turning 
much faster (I'm not sure about the exact numbers, you'd probably know 
better. Is 50k rpm out of line?). The upshot is the two devices are 
rather different animals. Not as different from each other as ram air is 
from either, but I think the engineering differences are more significant 
than you suggest.

Dear Archie,

Assuming you have an original dual indicator arrow tach in your car, go to
the back of the tach and with the switch in the right hand, turn position
check the black with white wire for ground. If it is not grounding, go to the
back of the column where the turn signal leadd exits and again check the
black with white wire for grounding (car on or off). If it doesn't ground
(quickly check the left in a like manner to see if it does) then plug in a
new switch.

Archie, there are thousands of 914 parts we have not listed in the catalog.
Always rest assured we have everything you need to perfectly restore your
914. The rear window guide you need is a part sold only with the side glass;
it is not available individually and we have not had enough call to have the
part made. Make sure it is not in the bottom of the door - look carefully. I
have missed them before! If you then still need the part, it is unfortunately

"...simple but tricky."   Hmmm....."...easy but hard."   WHAT!!!

All I do is loosen the air bleed screw as the engine warms (with heater 
control on MAX heat) and wait til the bleeder spews pure, steady coolant 
(not foam, bubbles, etc.).  Then I close the bleeder screw.  Done.  Are 
there more "tricks" I don't know of?  Please expound.  I don't want to blow 
up my cooling system.

I did have a little engine temp trouble at a 90 degree track event last July 
(temp needle at very top of OK range) so maybe I do have air in my cooling 
circuit or something.  I also had an overly rich coolant mixture - more 
antifreeze than H2O - which I learned recently is not a smart idea for 
efficient heat removal.

       Theres hardly a thing that you could do to your 912 that would
     be impossible to restore back to concours condition later...at a 
     price...Even something like putting in a JC Whitney Sunroof could
     conceivably be replaced or repaired. 912 and 911 donor parts just ain't
     that hard to find...

       If a change makes you happier to drive the car, do it. New seats, 911
     gauges, an a/c system that works...all good fun. In my own opinion,
     adding a whaletail and fiberglass 930 flares isn't a good idea from 
     taste or practicality, but if anyone ever wanted to restore it to 
     Pebbles Beach Concours condition (not likely, I think) unless you
     throw away everything you pull off or take a Stihl saw to the chassis,
     it can be redone. Restorers have resurrected cars much worse off 
     without the parts supply legacy that these high-production Porsches 
     have.... 

       The one thing you might consider is shelving your #0003 engine,
     though. I don't know how expensive cores are but that original case
     is the one thing you'd have trouble finding a replacement for....
     And if it needs to be rebuilt, why not start off with another core ? 
     Ditto any kind of replacement part (master cylinder, alternator, starter
     etc) don't ever give them back as a core for a rebuilt part. Keep them
     even after they go bad. 
                                    
       Enjoy your car, but don't get obsessed with it. Its all only sheet

Yeah, this is certainly something that depends in detail on the size
and shape of your foot and on the model and year of your car. The 1970
1.8 914 I am referring to (which is no longer available for my use)
had a long gas pedal that I could work with the heel of my foot, while
on the gas with the toe. This also works in my 1961 VW Beetle, and some
911s.

Anyway, the B-17 has a two-stage system for boost.  The first stage
is a turbocharger driven by exhaust gases.  The second stage is a
supercharger which is built onto the engine and gear-driven from the
crank shaft (or maybe flywheel).  I can't remember just how they are

on early trucks, intake air when used on 'blown' street or race engines.  The
G-charger and other centrifugal 'blowers', 'kompressors' and the like vary
their output volume with speed, at some rpm they are their most efficient and
pass the most gas.   Positive displacement superchargers have the
considerable advantage of NO lag, they simply feel like bigger displacement
engines.

Subject: rear window defoggers

pfilers (with early 70's cars):

This is for folks with early "1-stage" rear-window defrosters:

I've been working on mine lately and here is the net:

I get power to the back glass, but the individual lines on the window
seem to have built up too much resistance because when you test
with ohmeter there is continuity at the edges of the glass (where
the lines are bright and shiny) but you lose continuity as you
move in toward the center (where the lines look weak and have a
cruddy black color).

I looked at a used glass that also failed Ohm test.  I'm wondering
what the chances of any of those older units lasting 20+ years with
lines intact.  Any of you out there have *working* 1 stage defrosters?


Option 1:	Keep looking for used 1 stage unit that passes Ohm test.

Option 2:	Upgrade to newer "2 stage" unit with lines that cover most
		of the glass instead of narrow band 1 stage unit.
		Used ~$175.00 plus associated relays and wiring to upgrade.

Option 3:	Buy *new* backglass at ~$800.00: not bloody likely. (used
				$100.00).

I would like to do option 1 since it is closest to the "if it ain't broke
don't fix it" ethic and loathe the specter of changing the wiring to make
2 stage work.  Call me crazy but the old "simple up-grade with normal hand
tools" hasn't worked for me *lately*.

Advice and sedatives appreciated,

The SB2050 legislation doesn't tax older cars. As I read it there will

Hi Colin.

I have been told by several Porsche mechanics that Prestone in the yellow
bottle (or any other antifreeze that contains phosphates) should definitely
not be used in the 944 engine and the reason for this is that it will
deteriorate and weaken the head gasket. I use VW Autobahn antifreeze and I
think it's great (better than even the grey bottle Prestone).

The consensus seems to be that the '73 and later tower with the
factory short shift modification is the best setup. It greatly
improves the precision and feel of shifting - but don't expect
to speedshift a 915 transmission.

Thanks for the other points of view on this issue. That's what

First to Justin:
In front drive cars other than older SAAB 900's, handbrake is an invaluable
device to get the damn thing to turn in the snow.
Best technique is to keep the ratchet button pressed with your thumb, and
modulate the lever, steering and throttle during the corner as required to
control yaw.  Doesn't work well on cars with foot parking brake (i.e.,
Mercedes - but doesn't need it due to RWD; Taurus SHO).
NEVER do this in the dry - you'll flat-spot your rear tires.
Have been using this technique in the snow whenever possible/needed, hundreds
of times, many years, often as a safety measure - no damage possible unless
you loose the car (which is quite difficult).

...And to Magnus Ottenstrom:
AMEN!!  I have over 160k miles on my '86 900 Turbo since new, and it is hard
to replace (and not just because it isn't worth much money any more...), and
my wife's '88 Volvo 745 Turbo is equally satisfying (both with some

Because giving money to the government is like giving a fully fuelled 911

starlet. Look at all the money we gave Orange County, now it's all gone, and

Pete,
I've read that as early as 1937 Professor Porsche experimented with 
a twin carb. Roots supercharged VW. You mentioned the 114 which I 
understand were really drawings 114, 114K1 and 114K2 (all three drawings 
show a midship engined car). The two successor had reference numbers 115 
and 116 with 115 having a supercharger and 116 a bored out VW 1.5 litre 
(or liter) power plant.

Just before the war three cars were built on revised 114 drawings that were 
known as 'Project 64' or 'Type 64'. I understand only one survived but I'd
I hav'nt been able to find any further information about these cars.
'The Porsche Book' by Lothar Boschen & Jurgen Barth has three beautiful
photos of one of the Type 64's (It looks like the result of a
marriage between a 356 and a 911.) IMHO. (But that would be an egg before
a chicken would'nt it)

Hmm.  I've got an early 73 targa with a non-functional rear defroster.  It

I expect that my problem is similar to yours.  I get voltage to the

Subject: Porsche WSC car



With less than 2 weeks before the 24 Hours of Daytona, IMSA today changed
its regulations for turbocharged WSC cars (Porsche is the only such entry).
Copied below is the announcement. Thought you'd be interested. Anyone got an
Internet address for IMSA?

Larry Wilson

**********************

TAMPA, Fla. (January 24, 1995) -- IMSA announced today adjustments to the
regulations for turbocharged World Sports Cars running in the Le Mans
category at the 1995 Rolex 24 at Daytona.  Mandatory air intake restrictors
were decreased in diameter to 45.5 mm for single turbos and 32 mm for twin
turbos.  Minimum weights for turbocharged Le Mans World Sports Cars were
increased 100 lbs. to 2050 lbs.

The IMSA World Sports Car formula does not allow turbocharged engines for
competition in the domestic EXXON World Sports Car Championship.

Parallel regulations for the 1995 24-Hours of Le Mans include a turbocharged
World Sports Car option.

A provision for these "Le Mans" cars was included in the regulations for the
1995 Rolex 24 at Daytona to help garner international propagation of the
IMSA World Sports Car concept.  Le Mans cars competing at Daytona are not
eligible to earn EXXON World Sports Car Championship points.

As announced in the original Daytona regulations, IMSA reserved the right to
adjust the initial specifications for Le Mans World Sports Cars at any time
preceding the event.  After a careful and extensive review of available
data, IMSA has decided that the potential of such engines exceeds original
estimates and that a legislated reduction in performance was required.

In Addendum #3, in addition to the technical specifications noted in the
announcement, the "turbo boost pressure as measured by IMSA must not exceed
1 bar (14.5 psi) over actual atmospheric pressure."

Subject: Evaporating hazardous waste


For those of you who asked about what happens when things like brake fluid, 
solvents, and anti-freeze evaporate....

It varies with the chemical.  Certainly it beats pouring it out on the 
ground.  Anti-freeze (ethylene gycol) reacts vigorously with any oxidant, 
like oxygen.  Since I work where I do (Environmental Studies) I guess I'd 
better find out how each of the usual automotive nasties ends up.

I'll check on anti-freeze, brake fluid, the usual solvents and whatever else 
comes to mind.  If anybody wants to know about other automotive wastes, send 
me a suggestion and I'll see what I can find.

Caveat:  Ultimate disposition of some of these things may not be known. 
 Which, of course, makes it even scarier.

Subject: heel&toe and the 914 and 924



	So I have the same question as the first person did with his
914.  On the 924 the brake is much higher than the gas peddle and the
gas peddle is hinged at the bottom, so it does not work so well to push
with your heel unless your foot is small enough to get completely
sideways.  My conclusion is that they have not really designed the foot
layout with this in mind.

This was much easier, for example, on my Triumph Spitfire where the
brake sat barely an inch from the gas and level with it and the gas hung
down on a link from above - then it was simple, in fact most new drivers
hit both peddles by accident and would complain they were too close.
Supposedly there were some racing layouts were one peddle was actually
above the other (confirmations?).

Try your dealer first...If he says that he cannot/will not help, then call
PCNA.  You will probably have to replace the entire switch.

Probably is the factory alarm in that position.  You can check by removing
the black trim piece (pry with a small screwdriver) and removing the switch
locknut.  The switch then comes out the inside of the quarterpanel through
the black plastic air vent.  If the switch says VDO on it, it's factory.

You can check the funtionality of the alarm system by jumpering the two
connectors together and seeing if your car will no longer start or if the
alarm goes off.

Good luck.

As I was sitting waiting at a "left turn only on arrow" intersection while
there were no cars in sight coming in the other direction, I wondered what
percentage of polution could be prevented if we asked our traffic enginners
to design a system that would minimize cars sitting at idle unecessarily.  

With the CHEAP computer power available today, it boggles the mind the
potential for improving flow, reducing polutuion, and saving presious gas
for more exciting purposes.

Do we have any systems or traffic engineers - or anyoneelse - in the group

Must be something in the coffee, but this triggered one or two neurons in my
(alleged)brain to dump this:  One night in '64, I was over at the house of
one of my German friends in Wiesbaden, who had "Vorsicht Kamera" (the
German edition of Candid Camera, complete w/Alan Funt) on the tube.

The episode shown was filmed in a park somewhere (probably Munich), with
the obvious intent of spoofing the well-known reputation of Germans to be
*very* obedient folks where law or regulation is involved.

The set-up was at a long foot path (with a 10' high hedge on the left),
that was intersected by another foot path, perpendicularly on the right.
The VK crew set up a couple of very professional white lines across the
intersection on the main path, about 5' on either side of the intersection,
complete with pedestrian traffic lights (walk, don't walk), then hid the
controls and got out of sight to film.

They must have shown about 20 takes of people strolling vigorously down the
main path (from either or both directions), who, when the VK crew would hit
the "Don't Walk" light, would *slam* on the brakes and stop.  And stand
there. And look around, very puzzled, obviously wondering what the hell was
going on here.  *But* not proceeding until the light changed to "Walk". In
the entire bit, only one guy "busted" the light, and even *He* stopped
first.  He looked around, everywhere, *very* furtively and *only* when he
was sure that no one would see him, did he continue on (*Very* rapidly). 
It was a scream!  

*Not* that there's any message here) (wink, wink; nudge, nudge, Know what I

Subject: re; superchargers vs. turbochargers

      One reason crank-driven superchargers made a comeback might have been
   for emissions. Apparently turbos reduce the ultimate temp or warmup 
   speed of the catalytic converter, the cat doesn't become effective
   until its hot. This is why Ford doesn't have a turbo available today.

      This is also a problem on the Oxygen sensor, as it has to be 600'
   before it operates okay (and so at startup the system is open
   loop). This was improved by the 3-wire sensors, including a heating
   element to warmup the sensor quickly. There have been proposals like
   this to heat up the Cat before startup to make it effective quicker,
   which matters like crazy to OEMs since their smog test is performed
   on cold engines where every misfire hurts. 

        There are a couple great books on engine management, the Bosch book
   is very good but even better is book by the same publishers on 
   Ford engine management, forget the name.

     Re; a past thread on adding the Paxton type superchargers to a 911,
   the Ford book posts a rule of thumb that  3.7 psi of turbo/supercharged
   boost is equal to a Point of compression ratio; i.e., a 911 which 
   normally has 9.8:1 compression really looks like 11.8:1 at 7 lbs boost.
   The old rule of thumb is that you double horsepower for every 15 pounds 
   boost. When Porsche introduced the 930 their race cars were 235hp/liter. 

     Re; comment of adding a supercharger to a 928, Koenig already did it
    with twin superchargers mounted over the cam towers.  I've wondered why
    turbos never caught on with 928s but imagine the problem was finding
    room for the plumbing (though I've heard its been done for 450hp
    from the 4.5 liter motor).

The other thing that seems to be almost universally ignored is the
resources required, and pollution generated, in the production of a
new car. I've heard (can't remember where) that around 50% of the
pollution caused by the average car throughout it's lifetime is
generated during manufacture. We're doing the Earth a favour by
preserving our cars for as long as possible.

I don't understand why this is never taken into account.

I brake with my big toe (with about three toes worth of the foot on the
pedal), and sort of roll the foot to the right to blip the throttle with
the side of my foot (at about the instep - the heel is not on the
throttle). In fact, after braking and transitioning to full throttle, I
just roll my foot off the brake completely and end up pressing the
throttle with the side of my foot.

Many people have complained about the brake pedal being "too high" -
don't forget that on the track or in an autocross, you'll be braking a
lot harder than you do on the street: that lowers the brake pedal
relative to the throttle pedal.

I do it the same way as Stan (essentially side to side, not really 
"toe and heel"), and have done it that way in 911's, 914's and 944's.
This may be helped by a decent sized shoe. I have seen people with small
shoes appear to have more problem with side-to-side. I believe that the
original poster's problem was that the pedals were at a different level.
This can make side-to-side more difficult, although not impossible,
given practice. Another alternative is to do some adjusting. There
is some latitude in the gas pedal position on a 914 through the
threaded end of the throttle cable. Make sure you readjust the pedal
stop so that it stops the PEDAL exactly at full throttle if you try
making this adjustment. The brake pedal actuating rod (connecting
the pedal to the cylinder) also has a section of threaded rod screwed
into a clevis which could adjust the height of the brake pedal. At
least some of the Porsche shop manuals say not to adjust this, so of
course I wouldn't be able to comment on the suitability of adjusting
the pedal height that way. For any threaded rod adjustment, make sure
at least a length equivalent to 1.5-2 diameters of the rod have thread
engagement.

BTW, if you do any adjusting, and you plan to drive your car on the 
track, don't adjust it for equal pedal heights with dainty little
street brake applications. When you really stomp on that pedal at
the end of a long straight, after a bunch of similar previous stops,
the brake pedal is going to go much lower. I would adjust it so you
can still toe/heel (e.g. side/side) after significant street practice
with the brake pedal as high relative to the gas as possible, to give
you the greatest possible range of brake pedal positions where you can
still toe/heel on the track.

The key is lots of practice under non-stressful conditions on the street.

Recently, AAA has released a study that concluded that automobiles are NO
LONGER the #1 source of air pollution (at least here in studied cities
here in the NE) and in some cases, cars are not even the #2 problem.

They concluded that further tightening of pollution control laws [new cars]

Not really completely sideways, although it is a bit unnatural-feeling at
first. What I try to do is to get the heel to land about 1 to 2 inches
above the hinge at the bottom of the gas pedal, which gives quite a lot
of pedal action for very little heel motion, and the brake pedal falls
a bit towards the back of the ball of my size 12 extra-wide foot.

I've driven in the ne (mass) where they've got them.  imho they were
inappropriately sized.  the roundabout needs to be two lanes for any
decent amount of crossing traffic even when the roads that lead
to it are single-lane. it doesn't have to be 1/2 mile in dia, but shouldn't
require a 4 wheel drift to get around at only a little slower than the
roads that intersect at it.  what can I say about the avg iq of the
drivers in a country where a drivers license is given to every indolent
moron that comes along.

driver training in the us (based on the driver training I received here, and
on experience w/other drivers/driver training here and abroad) is focused
soley on
1) operating the vehicle within the white lines.  a good driver is someone
   who doesn't kill themselves or someone else.
2) how to pass the test

no focus on driver courtesy, lane management, self awareness, forethought...


now, where's that nomex ?

The plane of the brake and accelerator pedals are not necessarily the same
when at rest. The accelerator needs to have its limits of travel (full in
 -full out) intersected by the plane of the brake pedal in its DEPRESSED
 position, because that is where it will be when you heel and toe and that is
the fulcrum , if you like, of the lever that is blipping the accelerator.

    The result of too much compression is predetonation. A longer duration
 camshaft, higher octane fuel, a richer mixture, or less ignition advance will
 reduce the chance of detonation at any given compression ratio. New engine
 management neatly incorporates the knock sensor, which will retard ignition
 if it senses vibration in the 5-8khz range;  essentially it optimizes 
 ignition for whatever grade fuel you are running. Newer engine management
 can actually isolate the cylinder that it pinging and retard it  
 individually. Pretty slick...
    Twin-plugs let you run less advance since the flame propagates from 2
 directions.  A friend did this on his 3.2l 914, getting 10.5:1 compression
 for him meant fly-cutting the case and barrels, trimming back the chain
 housings then bending the tensioner arms (and of course, starting off with
 pistons that wouldn't collide with his Garretson cams. Forget any cam with
 your CIS pistons). Then, the only alternative for the 2 plugs was the $1200
 Bosch distributor and $350 cap, nowadays aftermarket ignitions are available
 (like the Electromotive).  
    My other non-P car runs 9.5:1 on cheapest fuel I can run and works
 fine, no pinging. But it is jetted very rich. Alone, a compression ratio
 change of a point will probably give you negligible power bump, maybe 
 1 or 2%.  Compression  ratio changes are important if you start adding a
 lot of cam, but then to offset what dynamic compression the cam -lost-.
    Low-vacuum or any boost means you have to retard ignition timing, the
 "MAP" (manifold absolute pressure sensors which measure vacuum) or the
 "MAF" (mass airflow which measures actual quantity of air) detect the actual
 loading on the car and try to hit the first setting for mixture/ignition
 timing (then let the Knock sensor avoid damage from pre-ignition). Retarding
 the ignition works against you at high speed, since the flame still takes
 tens of crank degrees to propagate across the piston you can't get your
 spark out early enough (Pfilers with modified 944 turbos complain about 
 higher power but lower RPM). I don't know if or how a tuner gets around this
 except maybe with different fuels (i.e., how DOES an F1 car run 14,000  
 rpm....)

Been reading all the stuff on Supercharging and turbocharging. Verrrry
interesting!!

Anyway, you forgot one insideous contraption, the power recovery turbine
which was used on various Wright and Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines
(and others). This gizmo let the exhaust gasses spin a turbine 
which was connected to the crankshaft. Some claimed an 8% to 10% 
recovery. The engines had two stage superchargers, the last stage being 
used only at cruising altitude. These little bastards broke frequently,
so there was a decoupling box to keep from freezing the engine.

Supercharger speeds. Depending on the application, the supercharger
can be underdriven (slower than crankshaft speed) or overdriven 
(faster than crankshaft speed). Most applications are slower or
equal to cranshaft speed. In the hot rod world, what ever works.

Turbos are governed by flow and flow coupling to generate boost. The 
vanes will cavitate on both the driven and compressed sides. The trick
is to design the vanes to couple and provide boost without cavitation.
The wastegate helps by prventing overboost and back pressure, which can 
"stall" the drive side. Aircraft have a big advantage as the power 
settings and throttle response are fairly slow and aren't too badly
affected by turbo lag.

Hi Ken,
	I had that same problem a year ago with my '77 924, and it turned

as the oil pressure sensor, it went bad on me too, and it IS possible to 
pull it with the head still on.  Look and see if your unit has two 
connectors poking out of it.  If its like mine, it will, and this means 
that both the light and the guage run off the same unit.  I don't know 
why they say there are separate ones.  My suggestion would be to first  
replace this unit, since it gets less accurate with age, with one for a 
Rabbit with VDO guage package.  Its the same unit and it can be had at 
many VW parts stores for about $25 (vs about $75 for Porsche).  Get a  
copper O-ring to help seal it.  To get at it, slide an open wrench (Size?) 
behind it from underneath and SLOWLY inch it out by reversing the 
wrench every turn.  There's JUST enogh room to do it and it takes some time 
but it can be done.  Hope this works, let me know if you fix it or have

The day I turned 16 (oh, that halcyon day), I naturally rushed down to the
city hall in Augusta, GA and took my driver's license exam.  This rigorous
test had ten (count 'em, ten!) True/False questions and required the aspirant
to successfully drive two blocks, turn left for one block, back, and and back 
to the starting point without hitting a Policeman.  In my haste, I ran the 
stop sign at the first intersection (sleepy part of a <then> sleepy town).

The ...er, "examiner" riding with me asked "Son, why didn'tcha stop at that

adieu.  And I didn't even have a Porsche (note clever group relevance inserted

But I'm feeling *Much* better now... and I *do* have a Porsche now (ibid).

My previous '73 914/4 suffered from an engine fire which my brother

I can't agree with this.  I don't care how they take my money, I still
call it a tax.  And I can still find better ways to spend it than the

check certificiates for the older cars that we actually drive and new

getting a newer car to drive.  Being that my wife and I do drive older
cars (always well tuned) this is money directly out of _my_ pocket.

Also, here in San Diego, this is being sold to the community as the

Car & Driver or R&T recently had a related comment to make in it's letter from 
the publisher (I think that's what the column is called - is Williams his 
name?).

The column was talking about special interest groups & how specialty magazines 
such as C&D & R&T were aimed at a specialist interest group - people 
interested in cars!

OK, so that's pretty obvious. What struck me, having read the article, was 
this: if C&D & R&T have a paying audience (we the car enthusiasts) what better 
organization to lobby on our behalf than these C&T & R&T?

They frequently publish articles bemoaning the 55/65 limit & the fact that 
this is a revenue issue rather than a safety one. These columns usually 
include a comment about the NMA suggesting readers join but that's about as 
far as they go.

Why don't these two auto mags pick up the gauntlet, march to DC as true 
lobbyists & put the case to Congress as eloquently as they do each month in 
their magazines? They have a large audience behind them - more so than the 
NMA. They have a lot of money. What more do they need?

Am I'm missing something obvious here - are they afraid of losing their 
advertisers? It just seems so obvious: C&T & R&T writers don't like the 55/65 
policy & we, their paying readers, don't like it either. Surely, with two such 
motivated parties, this combination can't lose?

	Well, old 'vettes had the gas pedal shaped so there was a protrusion at
the bottom that went below the brake pedal...

	Of course, due to the SafetyNazis(tm) common sense like this is no
longer an option.
	Although I do not understand the complaints about the 914 - when I
first got my car, my first thought was, "Oh wow, I can actually heel and
toe in this car!"  Which was bloody impossible in my mom's Golf, as the
gas pedal was WAAAAAY too far up on the firewall. (bottom of gas barely
below bottom of brake)  And to make matters worse, the pedals were too
narrow for me to left-foot brake and clutchless shift - my feet always
interfered with each other.  Be glad you have a Real Car(tm)!

	I think the average schmo-type lawmaker thinks that most people would
rather have a new car, and the only reason they still have an old car is
because they're too cheap/poor to get one.  Which is the case, for MOST
people.  And those people are the ones whose old cars pollute.  However,
they fail to take into account people like me, and I think most readers
of this group will understand why I'd rather drive my 24 year old
Porsche than a 10 year old Chevy.  So send your representative a little
"information packet" the next time a bill like this comes up.

Dear P-philes;
Turbo chargers are routinely used in modern
recip aircraft engines to increase intake manifold
pressure when operating at atlitude.  This it to make
up for the loss of power w/ thin air.  They are not
typically used to get MORE power from an engine, but rather
to get RATED power at altitude.  Many WWII aircraft used
superchargers for the same reason, and also to get EXTRA
power for take-off or dog-fight for a very short duration.

I found that the 944 gas pedal is just too low to hell&toe easily.

I checked to learn if the 944 gas pedal can be 'raised'. It can't. (I hear
that the 911 gas pedal is adjustable.)

So I extended the height of the pedal:  I cut 3/4" thick of plywood in the
shape of the pedal, put a piece of metal on top of the wood, and sandwiched
the metal, wood, and original rubber gas pedal together with nuts&bolts.

Presto! The gas pedal is substantially higher and easier to heel & toe.

PITTSBURGH -

"Motorists balk at everything from having to use gasoline nozzles that
catch excess fuel vapors to buying a new blend of gasoline that trims
tailpipe emissions.  They refuse to subject their cars to a new type of
exhaust test, even thought the testing centers have already been built.
And they don't want electric cars, either."

"'They're like hyperactive children,' says Joseph Minott, the somewhat
exasperated executive director of the Clean Air Council in Philadelphia.
'They just keep shouting 'NO NO NO,' no matter what's suggested.'"

"If Pittsburgh were an isolated case, it wouldn't be a problem.  But it's
not.  The Clean Air Act - the broad federal law that gave rise to all
those things Pittsburghers hate - is under attack across the country.
In Maryland, angry motorists recently marched on the statehouse,
demanding a halt to that state's new emissions-testing program.  Drivers
in the New York area can listen to radio talk-show hosts gripe about how
reformulated gasoline [...] may be harming their engines and is
generally a dumb idea dreamed up by bureaucrats.  Business is also
complaining.  A push is on among corporate executives to halt a
requirement that companies find ways to get more workers to join car
pools.  Pennsylvania has yanked Philadelphia out of that program as a

This is an award that Henry Watts (the guy that wrote "Secrets of Solo

There was this one hairpin that I could not get right all day, at least not
during a lap that counted. On two different occasions I had spectacular
spinouts sending cones (9 or 10) flying all over the place.

I did have a have the 7th best time with an entry of 100. So its not like I

In many cities in California, inductive loops are embedded in the pavement
to sense cars waiting to make a turn or waiting for a light. If there is no
car in the left turn lane, sometimes the left turn arrow never comes on.
Etc.
 
In Europe, some cities have pictogram signs telling you to turn off the
engine while waiting for a light. Some car makers (VW?) have demonstrated
commuter cars that kill the engine instead of letting it idle (I know, I
know, there are Porschephiles who think their cars do that but aren't
supposed to...) and then relight the fires when the gas pedal is touched.
 
Bart Chambers describes a German Candid Camera episode with stop lights for
people. Somebody once pointed out that if you put a stop light in the middle
of the Sahara, Germans would stop for it. (You could try this closer to home
in Death Valley. Lots of Germans insist on visiting "Dett Velly.")

Dear Lynn,

I have been a follower of IMSA events for a long time now.

It pains me to see IMSA changing the rules again, at the last minute before
a major event, the 24 Hours of Daytona.

Yes, it would be nice for Ferrari if their vehicles were competitive. Yes,
it would be nice if Porsche was not so expert at finding loopholes that give
them a competitive edge. Yes, it would be nice if you could make a racecar
out of a pig.

The problem for any race team is the intransigency of the sanctioning body,
allowing the advantage written into the rules at the beginning of the season
to be written out at a whim.

I am saddened to see that Porsche is withdrawing their WSC cars from Daytona.

IMSA, Porsche, Ferrari, and the racing devotees are all hurt by this
decision.

Thanks for reading this far...

On 944 cars, in 1983, when they started making them.  I hear that they

Probably, but most galvanization is properly a cathode/anode operation with
a solution of zinc in suspension...

Yes...

As they say, if you don't know what the answer is, the answer is: MONEY.

Certainly in this case. Development of a new motor --- which is what you're

The potential implications of this bill, SB2050, and the "pilot" program it describes are far reaching. Sounds to me, after reading the summary of the bill being proposed, that this will affect ALL vehicles, new and old! Note in the fourth paragraph, the "bill" would require 

	"a decal disclosing the smog index, as
	defined, for each vehicle, as determined by the state board, to
	be affixed to a new motor vehicle.

And the other text seems to imply that the "Smog Index" is the total quantity, by mass, of pollutants that a vehicle is allowed to emit between smog tests. The text also implies that the "Smog Index" will be different for older cars than for new cars. Depending on what the "Smog Index" is set at for new vehicles, we could all be paying the Gov't. by the mile to drive our cars! We already pay the Gov't per gallon for our gasoline. More than 1/3 the price of gasoline is consumer TAXES, plus there are also manufacturers taxes imposed on the oil companies! Just more evidence that all this is not about pollution or the environment, but power and money, further increasing the size, scope, and cost of an already out of control government.

Subject: 944 non-OEM Radiator?


Hi P-philes,

I'm about to buy a new radiator for my 83' 944.

I saw a "heavy duty" non OEM radiator made by Autotechnik in the 
Performace Products catalog. The ad says that the radiator is made of 
brass and copper, and is rebuildable. The thing sells for $439.
This price sounds a little high, but it may make your engine last longer.

Questions:

Do any of you have any experience with these radiators?

Could the brass/copper construction have some sort of corrosive reaction 
with the aluminum block?

Any thoughts or advice appreciated.

Subject: The forgotten 968

I've resisted as long as I can.  I recently purchased a *new* 1995 968 from 
a local dealer for $8000 under sticker price (maybe some of you have seen 
the ads in Autoweek).  The car is fabulous in all respects. The dealers are 
*dying* to clear out their remaining 968's.  If anyone is interested in this 
car, and can afford 34K or so, *do it now*!  I predict that a few years will 
pass (maybe until that cold day in hell) before you can buy a new Porsche 
for 34K.  Thinking about that Boxter for 40K?  Good luck.

The 968 is the real thing (I'm sure the 944 guys and gals know what I'm 
talking about).  It's made (or was) on the assembly line right next to the 
911's.  It even smells like my old 912 on the inside!  It's fast, it handles 
as close to perfection as I've experienced, it looks great...

Anyway, I just needed to get this off my chest.  I never see 968's mentioned 
here. Now I will.  Thanks.  Get one while you can.

Subject: Never-Fog & Porsche windshields - help!

My 944's windshield seems to get foggy quite easily; I was wondering if 
anyone has ever tried using that "never-fog" product by the people who 
make rain-x. The only reason I hesitate to try it is that in my manual it 
states that SOME cars of my model year ('87) have a "Sekurit-flex" coating 
on them. What exactly is this coating, and how can I tell if my car has 
it?  ... I take this section of the manual with a grain of salt -- it 
later advises cleaning the glass with the well-known carcinogen BENZENE!  
... don't they have lawyers in germany? :)

Subject: Re: 356 T/O Bearings

Dear Walter:

      The Main Difference in the T /O bearings in the 356B and 356C is
related to the attachment position on the clutch cable arm. The 356C attaches
nearer the fulcrum and thus causes a greater movement of the clutch shaft and
T/O bearing. That's why the 356C T/O bearing has a shorter distance from the
"ears" to the lip. The 356B T/O bearing and clutch cable attachment point is
the reverse. A 912 T/O bearing is in BETWEEN, and can be made to work on
EITHER 356B or 356C, provided you do a little "machining" on the  support for
the "ears" of the 912 bearing and on the top, front side, otherwise the 912
 T/O bearing will hit the studs/bolts that hold the guide tube in place. 

Hope this helps.

American drivers would perhaps become somewhat disturbed at the infamous

in first timers because each exit onto the roundabout is via
a mini roundabout, so you can turn left and give way to traffic coming
from the right around the mini-roundabout and circulate clockwise round the
central roundabout in the outside lane with the mini-roundabouts
to your right, OR, you can turn right onto the mini-roundabout still giving 
way the the right and circulate counter clockwise around the large roundabout 
on the inside lane with the mini-roundabouts on the right! All you have
to do is to repeat the mantra "give way to the right", and all

drivers would have no problem with this, because it does not matter
which way you go round, and if they can cope with a complex rule base

   just roll my foot off the brake completely and end up pressing the
   throttle with the side of my foot.

   Many people have complained about the brake pedal being "too high" -
   don't forget that on the track or in an autocross, you'll be braking a
   lot harder than you do on the street: that lowers the brake pedal
   relative to the throttle pedal.

Subject:  911 heater blockage: hose?

Don't you hate those sudden funny "hot electrical motor" smells?
Last night, a slight whiff is how it started in my '85 911 coupe.

The problem is that the heater system - passenger's side only is dead,
both the vents to the windshield and to floor. 

Driver's side heat is OK, as is the "vent" system on BOTH sides (up & down).

Looking at the heater cables, both driver's & passengers side _seem_ OK.

If the passenger's side is broken (closed), then I wouldn't know how to
tell, for not only has the amount of drag to move it remained the same,
but with the blower switch on, when the passenger's lever is pushed all
the way down (off and with driver's already off), the blower DOES turn
off like its supposed to, regardless of its dial switch position.


Does this sound like maybe I've lost a passenger-side-only hose
connection, a broken cable or a blockage?  The car had been sitting idle
for 3 weeks; hope I didn't have a critter crawl up somewhere and die...


Just looking for whatever help can be offered,

   Many people have complained about the brake pedal being "too high" -
   don't forget that on the track or in an autocross, you'll be braking a
   lot harder than you do on the street: that lowers the brake pedal
   relative to the throttle pedal.

Subject:  911 heater blockage: hose?

Don't you hate those sudden funny "hot electrical motor" smells?
Last night, a slight whiff is how it started in my '85 911 coupe.

The problem is that the heater system - passenger's side only is dead,
both the vents to the windshield and to floor. 

Driver's side heat is OK, as is the "vent" system on BOTH sides (up & down).

Looking at the heater cables, both driver's & passengers side _seem_ OK.

If the passenger's side is broken (closed), then I wouldn't know how to
tell, for not only has the amount of drag to move it remained the same,
but with the blower switch on, when the passenger's lever is pushed all
the way down (off and with driver's already off), the blower DOES turn
off like its supposed to, regardless of its dial switch position.


Does this sound like maybe I've lost a passenger-side-only hose
connection, a broken cable or a blockage?  The car had been sitting idle
for 3 weeks; hope I didn't have a critter crawl up somewhere and die...


Just looking for whatever help can be offered,

Pete,
I disagree.  The reason I mentioned them is that I think they handle MORE
traffic than the standard intersection here in the US (or the same traffic
with less hassle/waiting/idling) when properly sized.  Though it would
be tough to retrofit them to existing street patterns(space) and to upgrade
so many drivers to include a cerrebellum.

Subject: Of 944 Turbos and Wastegates

Hi All;

All the recent talk about Turbocharging raises a question about my '89 944 Turbo 
(note the deft tie-in).  Between about 0.8 to 1.0 bar pressure (as measured by 
the in-dash pressure gauge), I hear a loud exhaust resonance in my car which 
sounds like a valve chattering.  At least I assume it is exhaust related.  Could 
this have anything to do with the wastegate opening and closing?  Could someone 
explain to me how the wastegate operates and what its purpose is?  Is this a 
normal sound heard on all/some/other 944 Turbos?  It is consistent in every gear 
at any speed.

This noise has been bugging me since I got the car last August.  I have assumed 
it is normal, but other thoughts are welcome.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: WSC95 Rules re Porsche

Greetings,

I've recently read the new rules you...ummmm, ahhhhh, *fine* people have
passed to restrict the performance of the recently announced Porsche
entrant.

The world owes you a debt of gratitude for saving us from the spectre of
competition from an engine that dares to be different.  Heck-fire, if
them ol' Germans want to run with the big dawgs, let 'em design and build
a new engine that's jest like all the rest.  If they can't afford to do
that, t'hell with 'em.  The *Sport* is better off without 'em.

*Nice* work, boys and girls!  I'm sure that, in your infinite wisdom,
you've noticed that I'm probably the sole person in the world that would
like to see Porsche participate in this series, much *less* do so on a
competitive basis.

You've doubtless also observed that I drive an older Porsche, and thus
reasonably concluded that I *seldom* purchase any measurable quantities
of consumable items of any *value*; and with unerring logic, you've
(doubtless, correctly) deduced that my custom would therefore be of
little value to purveyors of things automotive.

Naturally, even though many people respond to churlish behavior by
refusing to extend their custom to those engaging in, or sponsoring such,
the loss of custom from such unreasonable folk will be inconsequential
and have no impact.  And shoot, even if you and your sponsors lose the
custom of a few soreheads, what matters is that you did the *right*
thing. Why, *Heaven* forfend, the idea of lettin' Porsche compete under
the rules as they were announced might make 'em competitive ...(shudder)
the mind boggles! (...the sound of a mind boggeling...)

and Not (he says, with all the sincerity he can muster) that anyone would
think that *your* recent rules aimed at making the Porsche entry
uncompetitive could be considered "Churlish" by any *reasonable*
person... Stupid, sure.  Dastardly, well... OK.  Contemptible; definitely!

But "Churlish"...(OK, OK, "Churlish").

Have a wonderful life,

Hey Ben,

Thanks for the vote of confidence on US drivers, but from
what I have seen here in Las Vegas, I think you are being 
a little optimistic. Here, I regularly see people brake
when approaching a green light (I guess they're worried
that it will turn red on them) and speed up when the light 
turns red (so much for the first theory). As a matter of 
course, when sitting at a light here (red light for all
of you sagacious petard-producers.) and it changes, I will
generally make sure there isn't someone sailing through
the first few milliseconds of "new red light".

Subject: Re: Of 944 Turbos and Wastegates

I would describe it as more of a "chuffing" sound, and its is indeed your
friend the wastegate. It opens to allow excess boost to escape out exhaust.
Excess boost you say? No such thing you say? The turbo is designed to
optmize power in some way, meaning that under certain conditions more boost
is generated than they can really handle, so out the exhaust it goes. I've
heard of waste gates sticking in the closed postion. They make a lot of
power, for a little while. Love that sound!

Subject: Re: Legislation Alert--SB2050


There is one problem with round abouts - they work well when the flow of 
traffic is equal in all directions, however they tend to work badly in 
tidal traffic flows, because the odd car coming in from the right side 
(in UK) has priority. if you have cars arriving at about 80 yd gaps at 40 
mph, no one from the major flow can pull out, so the major flow backs up.

And contrary to US opinion, no bstar will ever slow up to let people pul 
out from the major flow.

This is especially true for "mini round abouts" where the minor flow of 
traffic can take the round about without slowing.

What would really improve the flow on these round abouts is speed bumps 
on the round about entrance - this would also make it safer for pedestrians.

OK, OK, perhaps I was a bit hasty to think that roundabouts
that allow contra-rotating traffic would be the answer to
traffic problems in the US. I have received many suggestions
that negotiating such a hazard would be beyond the capacity
of all but the most ardent, advanced motorists, and that 
undoubtedly if my suggestion were implemented, a significant 
increase in kerb-surfing and a massive boost in the bodyshop 
business would result. 

Also, as an aside it is a great shame that the factory are
out of Daytona. I wrote a polite missive to the Communications

forthcoming.

As I understand wastegates (in my limited, English-major way), they are a basic
pressure-relief valve, like a pipe sticking out of the intake with a flap on 
the end.  This "flap" (valve) is held closed by a spring with a pre-set tension.
Once the boost reaches (or exceeds) a predetermined limit, the pressure of the
air on one side of the valve exceeds the pressure exerted on the flap by the
spring, the flap opens and lets the excess pressure bleed off until it is low
enough that the spring can close the flap again.  (In the "evil" turbo mods, the
pressure exerted by the spring can be changed, increasing or decreasing the
pressure at which the waste gate operates.)  My guess is that the chattering
you hear is the wastegate flap opening and closing at its rated pressure as the
individual pulses flowing through the exhaust spin the impeller just enough to
raise the pressure above the wategate's limit.  I'm sure a *real* engineer
could tell you if the chattering is directly related to your engine speed, a
harmonic thereof, or if it's determined as a function of the diameter of the
waste gate valve, the rated pressure and the overpressure, but my wife's not
here at the moment...

I have to concur with Pete.  There were a couple of roundabouts in 
Smashachusetts, near Cape Cod that I had to negotiate.  Mass. drivers had 
serious problems dealing with forward progress in a more or less straight 
line, never mind any type of arc.  I lived in R. I. and rte.95, the main 
freeway thru the state had a lot of off/on ramps along some sweepers in 
Providence. Suicide city!!!People haven't yet grasped the concept of staying 
in a lane and negotiating a curve.  Triple lane changes in traffic at speed 
are normal fare for Mom in the station wagon with the kids and dog in the back.

Pete,
I disagree.  The reason I mentioned them is that I think they handle MORE
traffic than the standard intersection here in the US (or the same traffic
with less hassle/waiting/idling) when properly sized.  Though it would
be tough to retrofit them to existing street patterns(space) and to upgrade
so many drivers to include a cerrebellum.

   Work send me to Hemel Hempstead last October for three weeks and I had the
opportunity to experience the "Magic Roundabout" first hand.  I rented a 
brand new BMW 316i(which handled very nicely even though it lacked punch) and
spent time driving back and forth from Hemel Hempstead to Leicester.  
   I only found myself on the wrong side of the road once or twice and this 
was only on empty roads.  Having the driving console on the right side of the
car makes driving on the right-side of the road much more natural.  It did,
however, take some time to train my left hand to shift.  What better to 
practice on than a rented car!

   A co-worker related his story of driving in England(he has also spent time
in Hemel Hempstead).  Bound and determined to master English driving the first
evening(after making numerous mistakes I might add), he spent 30 minutes 
driving on the "Magic Roundabout"!  He figured if the could master it than he
could handle anything and it worked.

   I particularly like the "single carriage" roads which have a protocol all
of their own...

Yes, you can disconnect the belt and all will be well.  Except your 
upper arm muscles may get a little sore, and the excessive pressure you 
apply to the steering wheel may annoy the leather.  I've been driving 
this way for about 4 months.

Beware of rebuilt racks; I installed one and it barely lasted a year.  
The shaft must be polished to new specification in order to avoid seal 
damage, but this is not done in many cases.

A friend of mine got a *new* ZF rack installed, from ZF directly, for a 
price thought to be well below $900 (he can't recall exactly).  You can 
do this job yourself but the job is difficult at times.  I wouldn't 
recommend it unless you're fairly experienced and you have a good range 
of tools.

IMSA has also just changed the rules for the Porsche LMWSC car, lowering the
boost (and the boom, I guess). Fearful that the car which was significantly
slower than the lead Ferraris in testing would run away with the 24 hour, the
changes robbed the team of an estimated 50 horsepower. 
Walkinshaw (and Porsche) has pulled the team from the race. As someone who
has constructed a car for an IMSA series only to have the rules changed at
the last moment, I can sympathize with the Porsche factory. Why build a car
when rules stability is such a volatile concept? Indeed, as a fan I was
looking forward to the Porsche/Ferrari/Ford/Olds showdown--which now won't
happen. It's really unfortunate that IMSA has made a decision which is only
another incident which could keep Porsche out of sports car racing.

Subject: Of 944 Turbos and Wastegates

Hi All;

All the recent talk about Turbocharging raises a question about my '89 944 Turbo 
(note the deft tie-in).  Between about 0.8 to 1.0 bar pressure (as measured by 
the in-dash pressure gauge), I hear a loud exhaust resonance in my car which 
sounds like a valve chattering.  At least I assume it is exhaust related.  Could 
this have anything to do with the wastegate opening and closing?  Could someone 
explain to me how the wastegate operates and what its purpose is?  Is this a 
normal sound heard on all/some/other 944 Turbos?  It is consistent in every gear 
at any speed.

This noise has been bugging me since I got the car last August.  I have assumed 
it is normal, but other thoughts are welcome.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: WSC95 Rules re Porsche

Greetings,

I've recently read the new rules you...ummmm, ahhhhh, *fine* people have
passed to restrict the performance of the recently announced Porsche
entrant.

The world owes you a debt of gratitude for saving us from the spectre of
competition from an engine that dares to be different.  Heck-fire, if
them ol' Germans want to run with the big dawgs, let 'em design and build
a new engine that's jest like all the rest.  If they can't afford to do
that, t'hell with 'em.  The *Sport* is better off without 'em.

*Nice* work, boys and girls!  I'm sure that, in your infinite wisdom,
you've noticed that I'm probably the sole person in the world that would
like to see Porsche participate in this series, much *less* do so on a
competitive basis.

You've doubtless also observed that I drive an older Porsche, and thus
reasonably concluded that I *seldom* purchase any measurable quantities
of consumable items of any *value*; and with unerring logic, you've
(doubtless, correctly) deduced that my custom would therefore be of
little value to purveyors of things automotive.

Naturally, even though many people respond to churlish behavior by
refusing to extend their custom to those engaging in, or sponsoring such,
the loss of custom from such unreasonable folk will be inconsequential
and have no impact.  And shoot, even if you and your sponsors lose the
custom of a few soreheads, what matters is that you did the *right*
thing. Why, *Heaven* forfend, the idea of lettin' Porsche compete under
the rules as they were announced might make 'em competitive ...(shudder)
the mind boggles! (...the sound of a mind boggeling...)

and Not (he says, with all the sincerity he can muster) that anyone would
think that *your* recent rules aimed at making the Porsche entry
uncompetitive could be considered "Churlish" by any *reasonable*
person... Stupid, sure.  Dastardly, well... OK.  Contemptible; definitely!

But "Churlish"...(OK, OK, "Churlish").

Have a wonderful life,

Hey Ben,

Thanks for the vote of confidence on US drivers, but from
what I have seen here in Las Vegas, I think you are being 
a little optimistic. Here, I regularly see people brake
when approaching a green light (I guess they're worried
that it will turn red on them) and speed up when the light 
turns red (so much for the first theory). As a matter of 
course, when sitting at a light here (red light for all
of you sagacious petard-producers.) and it changes, I will
generally make sure there isn't someone sailing through
the first few milliseconds of "new red light".

jack support plates, outer rocker panels, etc and would like make sure I get
the THICKEST replacement pieces available.  I have spoken with the people at

Subject: Re: Of 944 Turbos and Wastegates

I would describe it as more of a "chuffing" sound, and its is indeed your
friend the wastegate. It opens to allow excess boost to escape out exhaust.
Excess boost you say? No such thing you say? The turbo is designed to
optmize power in some way, meaning that under certain conditions more boost
is generated than they can really handle, so out the exhaust it goes. I've
heard of waste gates sticking in the closed postion. They make a lot of
power, for a little while. Love that sound!

There is one problem with round abouts - they work well when the flow of 
traffic is equal in all directions, however they tend to work badly in 
tidal traffic flows, because the odd car coming in from the right side 
(in UK) has priority. if you have cars arriving at about 80 yd gaps at 40 
mph, no one from the major flow can pull out, so the major flow backs up.

And contrary to US opinion, no bstar will ever slow up to let people pul 
out from the major flow.

This is especially true for "mini round abouts" where the minor flow of 
traffic can take the round about without slowing.

What would really improve the flow on these round abouts is speed bumps 
on the round about entrance - this would also make it safer for pedestrians.

OK, OK, perhaps I was a bit hasty to think that roundabouts
that allow contra-rotating traffic would be the answer to
traffic problems in the US. I have received many suggestions
that negotiating such a hazard would be beyond the capacity
of all but the most ardent, advanced motorists, and that 
undoubtedly if my suggestion were implemented, a significant 
increase in kerb-surfing and a massive boost in the bodyshop 
business would result. 

Also, as an aside it is a great shame that the factory are

Subject: Re: Of 944 Turbos and Wastegates

Tracy Meyer asked recently:
All the recent talk about Turbocharging raises a question about my '89 944 Turbo 
(note the deft tie-in).  Between about 0.8 to 1.0 bar pressure (as measured by 
the in-dash pressure gauge), I hear a loud exhaust resonance in my car which 
sounds like a valve chattering.  At least I assume it is exhaust related.  Could 
this have anything to do with the wastegate opening and closing?  Could someone 
explain to me how the wastegate operates and what its purpose is?
- ---

As I understand wastegates (in my limited, English-major way), they are a basic
pressure-relief valve, like a pipe sticking out of the intake with a flap on 
the end.  This "flap" (valve) is held closed by a spring with a pre-set tension.
Once the boost reaches (or exceeds) a predetermined limit, the pressure of the
air on one side of the valve exceeds the pressure exerted on the flap by the
spring, the flap opens and lets the excess pressure bleed off until it is low
enough that the spring can close the flap again.  (In the "evil" turbo mods, the
pressure exerted by the spring can be changed, increasing or decreasing the
pressure at which the waste gate operates.)  My guess is that the chattering
you hear is the wastegate flap opening and closing at its rated pressure as the
individual pulses flowing through the exhaust spin the impeller just enough to
raise the pressure above the wategate's limit.  I'm sure a *real* engineer
could tell you if the chattering is directly related to your engine speed, a
harmonic thereof, or if it's determined as a function of the diameter of the
waste gate valve, the rated pressure and the overpressure, but my wife's not
here at the moment...

Pete,
I disagree.  The reason I mentioned them is that I think they handle MORE
traffic than the standard intersection here in the US (or the same traffic
with less hassle/waiting/idling) when properly sized.  Though it would
be tough to retrofit them to existing street patterns(space) and to upgrade
so many drivers to include a cerrebellum.

   Work send me to Hemel Hempstead last October for three weeks and I had the
opportunity to experience the "Magic Roundabout" first hand.  I rented a 
brand new BMW 316i(which handled very nicely even though it lacked punch) and
spent time driving back and forth from Hemel Hempstead to Leicester.  
   I only found myself on the wrong side of the road once or twice and this 
was only on empty roads.  Having the driving console on the right side of the
car makes driving on the right-side of the road much more natural.  It did,
however, take some time to train my left hand to shift.  What better to 
practice on than a rented car!

   A co-worker related his story of driving in England(he has also spent time
in Hemel Hempstead).  Bound and determined to master English driving the first
evening(after making numerous mistakes I might add), he spent 30 minutes 
driving on the "Magic Roundabout"!  He figured if the could master it than he
could handle anything and it worked.

   I particularly like the "single carriage" roads which have a protocol all
of their own...

Yes, you can disconnect the belt and all will be well.  Except your 
upper arm muscles may get a little sore, and the excessive pressure you 
apply to the steering wheel may annoy the leather.  I've been driving 
this way for about 4 months.

Beware of rebuilt racks; I installed one and it barely lasted a year.  
The shaft must be polished to new specification in order to avoid seal 
damage, but this is not done in many cases.

A friend of mine got a *new* ZF rack installed, from ZF directly, for a 
price thought to be well below $900 (he can't recall exactly).  You can 
do this job yourself but the job is difficult at times.  I wouldn't 
recommend it unless you're fairly experienced and you have a good range 
of tools.

IMSA has also just changed the rules for the Porsche LMWSC car, lowering the
boost (and the boom, I guess). Fearful that the car which was significantly
slower than the lead Ferraris in testing would run away with the 24 hour, the
changes robbed the team of an estimated 50 horsepower. 
Walkinshaw (and Porsche) has pulled the team from the race. As someone who
has constructed a car for an IMSA series only to have the rules changed at
the last moment, I can sympathize with the Porsche factory. Why build a car
when rules stability is such a volatile concept? Indeed, as a fan I was
looking forward to the Porsche/Ferrari/Ford/Olds showdown--which now won't
happen. It's really unfortunate that IMSA has made a decision which is only
another incident which could keep Porsche out of sports car racing.

Aha!  Kevin has defined a *rare* rare example of how Occam's Razor occasionally

*after* he spent months of due diligence looking for the *likely* problem.

My theory is that Occam and Murphy have collaborated to come up with a
Particularly Devious Natural Law wrt care and feeding of Sports Cars:

If you go in thinking Occam, Murphy will prevail.  If you assume Murphy,
(if it can be difficult, it will, etc.) you should have gone with
Occam.

Repeat as necessary.

In my case, there is power to the glass, so Occam is no help here.

My driver's side fog-light is out.  What should be a fairly simple replacement
looks like another of my fix-it misadventures.  One of the 4 bolts holding the
light was so rusty that the head snapped off with very little force.  Time to 
get out the drill, start drilling, tough to drill dead center, start chewing 
up the plastic tab where the bolt sits in.  <sigh>.

Anyway, has anyone upgraded their fog lights for higher output?  Can the stock
wiring/relay handle the higher power?  Anyone replaced the 'extra' reflector 
with a dual-bulb set-up?  If so, then I'm thinking of installing a second 
switch to control the second 'high-intensity' driving light while maintaining 
the stock light for normal highway use.  In rural Pennsylvania where street 
lights are not common, I could use more light to see the various wildlife 
likely to be sitting on the road esp on the winding back roads taken at P-car 
speeds.  I realize I'd have to switch these off momentarily to avoid blinding 
oncoming traffic.  Then again, I could use the high-beams but I'm looking for 
a longer beam.  It's winter and I need to 'fix' something on my P-car so I

We have many many roundabouts here in New Jersey, mostly left
over from colonial horse and wagon days. Drivers here seem to
negotiate them pretty well, although lane discipline is non-
existant. I think they would work well with some sort of public
service messages on TV telling people how to politely enter and
exit. 

The thing I like about them is that during non-peak hours, they
make great skid pads :-) :-) :-)   Enter hot, trail brake (did
I say that?) snatch a lower gear, hang the tail out, and exit 
"at speed" with right foot steering -- WeeeeeHaaaaa!

I noticed that the last couple of times I was in the UK, a good
percentage of the drivers go straight over the mini-roundabouts
(those 2 meter dots) Is this new traffic policy or a shameful

IMHO, Ferrari probably pressured IMSA to do this...

Ferrari made a big investment in IMSA by building the 333 SP and has been
a key to helping to make WSC at least a partial success.  Ferrari also 

seems to have some degree of control over the rules (witness Ferrari 

pushing back on rev limit rules that IMSA attempted to impose mid season
last year which IMSA backed down on when Ferrari threatened to pull out).
We can debate all day whether this is "right" or not, but Ferrari DID make
a significant financial commitment to WSC which Porsche doesn't appear 

to be willing to make.  OTOH, there are some who say that Porsche could
possibly have won the race even with the HP deficit due to possible 

reliability problems with the 333SP's powerplant which was designed primarily
for sprint racing.  They'd probably run the sprint motors for qualification
then de-tune them for the race itself creating more parity with the Porsche
than can be determined solely by testing times.  I wished Porsche/TWR would
have toughed it out anyway...

One other somewhat conspicuous absence from this race is the Porsche
GT-2.  I'm not that familiar with IMSA's GT-class rules, but I thought
the GT-2 would fit IMSA's GTS specs?

From what I have seen, well designed light systems give you predictable 
flow, fairly regardless of the person in front.

With small roundabouts, you are often at the whim of some twonk who cannot 
master the controlled barge.

The curious thing about it is that this chap takes 10 minutes to pluck up 
courage to pull out, then drives like stink and does all he can to stop

Sounds as if the original hardware's been replaced.  Those screws 
shouldn't rust - at least, mine look like new, and they're 8 years old 
(stored during winter).

Yes, Yes, Yes, in that order.  I measured voltage drop across the 
wires, using a stock 55w bulb and my current 100w bulb.  The power 
dissipation increase was modest, and there's a separate wire & fuse for 
each high beam line - very good quality design.  I'm using stock 
wiring, with higher fuse ratings.  My driving lights (Euro units) are 
100w also, with a dedicated relay.  They come on parallel with the main 
beams.  I've also modified the guts of the little square black module 
in the fuse box, so the fogs stay on regardless of main/dip beam setting.

So, with dip beams on everything's normal and other drivers aren't 
blinded.  But when I switch on the highs, I get 400w of light!  (This 
is dangerous during the dry season, as some grass and trees may catch 
fire...)  :-)

Ahhhhhh, yes....

There is nothing so wonderful as that feeling right after you purchase one
and are tooling down the road with that unmistakable ear-to-ear grin (that
can't be wiped off).  To top it off, it *could* be the best deal I've made
on ANY car, let alone a Porsche....

While we were looking for an early SC to play at the track and do tours,
etc. with, an ad popped in the Houston Chronicle:

'84 Carrera, Black/Tan, very clean, must see....  $14,560

For those of you in the Houston area that saw this and didn't call,
well.....

What I found was:

One owner sunroof coupe in excellent condition, 117K miles but with double
the routine maintenance and records -- Trans rebuilt w/ new clutch at 98K.
 AND the BEST part:

It has Factory:
Carrera Spoilers
Short Shift
Limited Slip
Sport Shocks
Full Leather (actually taupe color)
Climate Control
Alarm, etc. etc.  (even has a cellular phone])

Oh, I almost forgot the VERY best part; he sold it to me for  (are you

Tracy,

I'm not sure what the noise is that you're hearing. I too have a 1989 Turbo S
and haven't had that experience. This is the second 951 that I've owned and
neither have that noise. All I hear is a whir when the turbo spins up. If you
can hear this noise you describe with the windows up you may want to have it
checked by a Porsche mechanic. At least get their opinion...
BTW-great car aren't they.

Subject: 912E #1 Oil Leaks!!! Best rebuilds?

Greetings Porsche Dwellers,
	I was driving the 912E home from work and noticed it was smoking 
even more than usual.  Rings getting more worn I thought.  Come out to 
drive to work the next morning and behold, the River Jordan sprang forth 
from my car!  The River of Oil seeped from a lower crankcase seal and ran 
down my driveway leaving a HUGE stain.  Back to commuting in my 924 (my 
912E looked much cooler!).   
	First  question, how do you get oil stains off your driveway and second 
of all, most importantly, what do I do for a rebuild.  This thing has 
146K miles on it (and no one installed a radio?? :^) so it needs a 
thorough going over.  914 2.0 engines are rebuilt similarly aren't they?  
Who does the best most original job, and how much can I expect to pay?  
I'll pull the engine myself.  About the radio that generated much 
response: I'm leaving it the way it is--original and using a small radio 
powered by cigarette lighter to listen to tunes.  I'm not going to be 
paranoid about my car, I'm just going to enjoy it while keeping it as 
original as possible. Thanx!!!

Motorists should rebel at the continuous erosion of our liberties.  HOV
lanes are a good example of how the person who likes to work late or come
in early when necessary is discriminated against, in favor of the person
who ALWAYS works the same, but just enough hours.  They also discriminate
against people like my wife who has to help her aged parents after work,
and can't carpool.  Of course they could always go on welfare and a social
worker nurse could drive 30 miles each way to help, all at taxpayer
expense.  Now in Seattle they're trying to take away parking from
employers to force people into carpools. 

Dennis Simanaitis in the latest Road and Track makes an apropos comment

Subject: Re: Of 944 Turbos and Wastegates

A couple of folks have responded that the noise may be the waste gate
and went on to say that the waste gate relieved intake manifold pressure
by opening it to the atmosphere. Hmmm. The waste does regulate
intake manifold pressure, but unless the 951 differs from other Porsches,
it does so by controlling the exhaust pressure to the turbine. When intake
boost goes too high, the waste gate opens so that exhaust gases are
routed from the exhaust manifold directly to the tail pipe, bypassing
the turbine.

BTW, I noticed that one of the Daytona entries is a 968 turbo. Too
bad Porsche hasn't tried to get US DOT approval for a street version
in the US. I understand that a non-race version is sold for street use
in Europe.

Another Daytona Porsche is a GTS-1 turbo 911. I wonder if that is
the new, factory 993 GT. Anyone know?

Your car has a VW 411 engine.

Anyone who does VW engines can rebuild yours. You should try to use the
same quality parts that were used at the factory. I wouldn't get
excited about making changes from the stock configuration/specs unless
they came from someone who really know what was going on. Guys who soup
up VW dune buggies in their garage on weekends might not be the best
way to go.

I support your decision to keep the car basically original. It's really
in your best economic interest. 

Having to do a engine rebuild after buying an older 911/912 is not
unusual. This is the reason quite a few are sold. At least you get to
control the rebuild..not the PO. It is a good idea to take photos when
the engine is apart. This will be comforting to the next owner if you
decide to sell the car before the next 146K miles goes by.

To be caught in one's own trap: "The swindler cheated himself out of most

hoisted, or lifted, by a petard literally means to be blown up.

Subject: re: Smog legislation (long)

Once more into the (potential) fires.  If any of the following was mentioned 
in digest #1101, I apologize for the duplication.  Said digest arrived here 
but empty.

I have been a bit surprised that nobody has mentioned the car crushing 
programs that were -- and perhapsstill are -- in effect in CA and PA.  These 
programs are promoted as removing old smog-monsters from the road thereby 
reducing the amount of air pollution.  For a while you could find pictures 
of ecology-minded ex-owners standing in front of their flattened, ex-autos 
with a several-hundred dollar check in their hands.  It went without mention 
that the program was/is sponsored by at least one automobile manufacturer 
and petrochemical company all of which receive "pollution credits" for 
stationary sources.  Put simply, if they destroy a mobile pollution source, 
they receive an additional grace period for reforming their manufacturing 
plants.  There is no reduction in air pollution, merely a transfer from one 
source to another.

Chris Willis asks (probably rhetorically) why they (whoever *they* are) 
never mention the amount of pollution generated during the manufacture of 
the car.  Because this would offend large businesses that donate 
astronomical amounts of money to political campaigns.

Brian Foster suggests boycotting the companies that support this kind of 
legislation which is a good idea if you can find an insurance company or oil 
company that doesn't.  You still need both to run your old(er) car.

Sounds like a conspiracy.  Someone call Oliver Stone.

Finally, on the subject of hoisting by one's own petard . . .  It was 
mentioned that autos are *not* the leading cause of air pollution.  Quite

The engine IS NOT A VW 411 it is based on the 411 but is a 914 2.0

Never-Fog works for me. I don't have the best heat in the old 911 and it 
takes a while to come up, so I have used this stuff for several years 
with good success. I do find that it doesn't last all that long, and that 
if you don't clean the inside with a regular cleaner about once a month

Mike is 1000% right. The 412/411 engines are *NOT* the same as
the 914 2.0s which are *NOT* the same as 912Es.

If possible, fine someone that's worked on a 912E. If that's not possible,
*PLEASE* find at least a 914 expert. *DO NOT* use "Bob's Pretty Good

Affect is relative; on the Piper Turbo Arrow IV I used to fly, the wastegate
is fixed in position (no DME to control it!).

The technique on takeoff was to advance the throttle to a position determined
by experience, watch as the boost came up (monitoring the Manifold Pressure
gauge) and then "tweak" the throttle to the target manifold pressure, while,
of course, doing all the other things required during the early part of a
takeoff roll. Overboosting was considered VERY bad practice (likely to exact
its own retribution from the miscreant, or at least the next pilot to fly the
ship!), while less than optimal boost resulted in a longer takeoff roll and
soggy climb-out. The effect of turbo lag in this case was to cause a
wandering path down the runway as the pilot compensated for the extra power
coming on rapidly (which requires additional right rudder to balance the
aircraft's left turning tendency, for reasons too non-automotive to go into
here).

I suppose the first automotive turbochargers must have had simple, fixed
wastegates as well, no?

Porsche WSC Team Withdraws From 24 Hours of Daytona Due To Sudden Rules
Change

RENO, NEVADA, January 25, 1995 --- As the result of a surprising change in
regulations made on Tuesday, January 24, by sanctioning body IMSA which
affects the two open-cockpit Porsche WSC category sports prototypes, the
Stuttgart sports car maker has decided not to field a factory team in the
1995 edition of the 24 Hours of Daytona on February 4 and 5. The change in
regulations at such short notice is so severe that Porsche would not be able
to compete on an equal footing against Ferrari, its greatest rival. Porsche
AG deeply regrets the IMSA decision as this represents a severe setback for
efforts to establish an attractive world series for sports cars. Porsche AG,
active in the IMSA series since the early 1970s, does not pursue motor sport
as an end in itself, and will continue to enter only events which allow
reliable conditions for all competitors.

The new IMSA rule change for the two WSC Porsches has resulted in a
reduction in the size of the air restrictors of the twin-turbo engines from
34.5 mm to 32 mm, and an increase in vehicle weight from 1,950 lbs. to 2,050
lbs. Calculations made by Porsche engineers have shown that the air
restrictor reduction will result in a decrease of about 80 HP in power
output, from 540 HP to 460 HP. With this new power figure, the two WSC
Porsches would lap at least four to five seconds slower than their
competitors. Calculated over the 24-hour race distance, this would he a
disadvantage of at least one hour. These are conditions Porsche is unable to
accept.

During the official preliminary tests at Daytona at the beginning of
January, Porsche allowed IMSA officials to view vehicle data and had also
disclosed power curves. IMSA officials then confirmed the data was fully in
accordance with the regulations. This makes the sudden about face by IMSA
even more incomprehensible.

Porsche remains committed to motor sport and will continue to compete in the
future in view of the challenges racing poses for both man and machine.
However, Porsche will not participate in events where unreliable regulations
make entries an incalculable risk. For Porsche, sport means fair competition
between all entrants.

Commentary:
IMSA Throws Curve At Porsche
by Larry Wilson

On January 24, almost the eve of the February 4 and 5 24 Hours of Daytona,
the sanctioning body, IMSA, announced they would change the regulations for
the race by imposing additional restrictions to turbocharged World Sports
Cars running in the Le Mans category. Since the two Porsche WSC95 cars were
the only such cars entered, it was clear who IMSA had targeted. Porsche AG
reacted promptly January 25 by withdrawing from the race.

The five-paragraph IMSA press release included, "As announced in the
original Daytona regulations, IMSA reserved the right to adjust the initial
specifications for Le Mans World Sports Cars at any time preceding the
event.  After a careful and extensive review of available data, IMSA has
decided that the potential of such engines exceeds original estimates and
that a legislated reduction in performance was required." No where in those
five paragraphs did IMSA mention the name, Porsche.

It's hard to imagine what "data" IMSA relied on when making this decision.
It surely was not timing data compiled during the January 7-9 IMSA Test Days
at Daytona. The best time of the weekend went to car #30, Ferrari 333SP
(Taylor, Moretti, Salazar, Theys) with a lap time of 1:43.624. Fifth-fastest
car of the weekend was car #35, Porsche WSC95  (Andretti, Wollek, Goodyear)
with a time of 1:45.985. Sixth was the other Porsche WSC95, car #36 (Stuck,
Boutsen, Brabham) at 1:47.276. Although not said publicly, IMSA reportedly
believed Porsche had "sand-bagged" during the Test Days so as not to incur
additional restrictions. These rumors did not detail just how IMSA reached
this conclusion. Maybe the "data" that got IMSA's attention came from
Maranello.

Of even greater consequence in the IMSA announcement was the line, "Parallel
regulations for the 1995 24-Hours of Le Mans include a turbocharged World
Sports Car option." Porsche announced previously its intention of entering
the 24 Hours of LeMans with their new cars. Since the only way "in" was
through the IMSA turbocharged WSC option class, IMSA's rule change also
applies at LeMans. And, if Porsche believes its cars have been rendered
uncompetitive at Daytona, they will undoubtedly reach the same conclusion
with respect to LeMans and withdraw from that race.

In any case, it's sad. What could have revived the excitement of sports car
racing world-wide is now gone -- shot down by a sanctioning body in the U.S.
that forgot to read its own January 19 race-hype that promised Mario
Andretti, Geoff Brabham, Bob Wollek, and the revival of the Porsche vs.
Ferrari wars of past years. Also shot in this unseemly episode is the foot
of IMSA, a self-inflicted wound.

My '77 Carrera 3.0, with 915 tranny, sometimes suffers what seems to be a
lock-up that I can only describe as being in locked in reverse and
concurrently accessing any of the other gears.  As example, if I shift into
first or any forward gear, there is absolutely no movement at all; but if I
shift into neutral I can move in reverse.  So far this has happened only
while shifting FROM reverse and the "cure" is by repeated/firmly shifting out
of reverse until the lockup disengages.  So far mechanics only go "Hmmm", so
I'm reluctant to commit $$ when the repairer appears stumped - in the
meantime, I can manage with the "annoyance" as long as it doesn't appear to
be moving to permanent.  Any ideas?

I understand that the *911* series (at least some of them) were actually
RAISED from the euro spec height (for whatever reason) for US delivery.

1) Did Porsche use different suspension components ?
2) If not, wont lowering the car to ROW specs actually help things ?
3) I also hear that US 911's actually were set up to UNDERSTEER ?
4) Was the same suspension adjustement done for other P-Cars destined
   for the US ?

      I just had to reply to this, since my dad had a 411.  If memory serves

a VW AND a Porsche and get a little upset seeing VW's constantly being

is that the poor 914 has been maligned as a poor man's Porsche (or a rich 
man's VW), and now I hear people sticking up for it and saying no VW 
mechanic is worthy of working on one.  I would suspect that many German-car 
mechanics have worked on both at some point in time.  Just because its a VW 
doesn't make it cheap.  Many parts are every bit as expensive as Audi or 
Porsche parts.
     As much as some folks seem to despise VW, you can't get away from the 
family resemblance.  So instead of fighting it to the death, be proud of 
your cars' roots.  I am.

   Mike is 1000% right. The 412/411 engines are *NOT* the same as
   the 914 2.0s which are *NOT* the same as 912Es.

Hey P-filers,

I know all you Libertarians out there think that 'good legislation'
is an oxymoron, but have I got a treat for you. The Nevada legislature
has among its bills pending one that proposes to remove speed limits
from rural highways, just like it was pre-70's. Granted, its passage
is probably not likely, but the mind boggles at the possibility
(perhaps Bart could get off of his medication...) of motoring 'tres
vitesse sans les cuchons' (pardon my French). 

Perhaps I can get an address for mail to go to so all you P-filers
out there can write our 'lege and tell them how many tourism dollars 
you would be inclined to spend visiting our fair state (as opposed to
other 'fare states') if we went speed limits optional.

Who knows, maybe they'll change the state motto to "Damn the nuclear
waste: full speed ahead!"...

Doug,
If you can hear your wastegate bleeding off exhaust gas you probably have a
problem. (this does not apply to 930's etc.). If you are running a straight
pipe without cat then maybe you can hear it. I've owned a few turbo's and
I've never heard any noise from the wastegate except with my track car that
has a modified exhaust system. And yes I do get on the boost once in a great
while.
It is not uncommon for the exhaust system to decay at the waste gate piping
where it runs into the cat. You really don't want an exhaust leak, which is
what I expect you'll find, at that point in your system. Take a hard look at
it.

Hey Bob,

Sorry to hear of your misfortune. May the person responsible

As for the damage to your car, the bumperettes can be had for 
about $45-50 from a reasonably well stocked dismantler (look in 
Pano for some; if you're not in PCA, let me know and I can 
check for you).  My bumperettes were damaged by my brakes
being better than the brakes of a Testarossa. Of course, his

Most likely culprit is the Thermoswitch located on the radiator (upper

I can accept the engine delivered in a new 1976 VW 411, and a new 1976
912E are not precisely identical. But does anyone know where the 1976
912E engine was manufactured (inside the Porsche factory or inside the
VW plant)? Just what is different(pistons/cams/etc)?

The simple statement "Your car has a VW 411 engine" does not imply
anything about VW one way or the other. Does anyone claim the Porsche
engine design team had anything to do with this engine?

It would be helpful to know what is unique about the 912E engine that
makes competent, professional VW shop/mechanic a bad choice for the
rebuild. Because 912E was only made for a year, finding someone who has
done many rebuilds could be difficult.

Subject: RE: 89 944 Turbo allignment for racing


Hi Eric,

I don't think there's a pat answer to your alignment question, specifically
the camber.  It will depend on what else you do with the suspension and
on the kind of tires you use.

The only way to really tell is with a pyrometer, which is used to measure
the temperature profile across the width of a tire's tread.  If you are
thinking of PCA events at Lime Rock, you could hook up with me -- I
have a pyrometer and would be happy to help out.

Yes, if you lower the car, stiffer springing may be needed to keep from
bottoming out the suspension.  Again, depends on tires and how hard
you push the car.  I don't remember the stock rate.  I think it's 28 N/m,
and forget the conversion to lb/in.  Remember that negative camber is
used to compensate for positive camber changes induced by
suspension travel.  So stiffer springs => less induced camber => less
need for static negative camber.

As a sample point and for what it's worth, I have a 944S.  I use about
2.25 degrees negative in the front, 1.5 negative in the rear.  The car's
suspension has 200# front springs, 23.5 mm rear torsion bar (yours is
25.5, I think), 1-1/8" front sway bar set back 36mm from full loose,
a 7/8" rear bar run at full stiff, and some of the rubber bushings have
been converted to solid ones.  Handles well, and the pyrometer
readings are very flat across the tread face.

Hope this helps,

It's not a question of pride, it's one of COMMMON SENSE. There are damn
few parts that a VW Type II 2.0 (*NOT* even the 411/412 engine, which 
was only seen in the 1.7 config) share with a 914 or 912E. The heads
are different. The cam is different. The timing is different. The
pistons are different. Even the case is slightly different.

This is like saying that anyone who can work on high-voltage power lines
should be able to fix your computer because they share a common 
heritage and some parts (like say copper wire, PVC insulations, maybe
some odd bits of silcon, etc).

I my wife owns the nicest '73 Standard Beetle I've ever seen -- and has 
since 'late '72. Used to own a lot of early Type Is and IIIs, including
a Type III Karman Ghia, some split-window Beetles, etc. Rather than
deriding the heritage, I *REVEL* in it. 

It's just that I also know when it's appropriate to say "this is the same"
and when it isn't.

First, think 2.0 Type II, *NOT* 1.7 Type IV. It's *GENERICLY* called
a Type IV engine, but the late Type IVs area all really used in Type IIs
even though they're called Type IVs; the Type IV just didn't last real
long as a product...

Case, crank, con rods, misc external parts (some cooling sheet metal,
oil cooler, fan, filler cap, etc), misc internal parts (oil pump, crank
gears, pushrods, lifters, oil pressure relief, etc) are identical.
The 914 and 912E have Porsche designed heads, different valve gear,
very different sheet metal, and other slight internal differences that
would be easy to call to mind if I were standing over a split case...
The 914 have three different EFI setups, and the 912E is different still.
This means the induction system, including plumbing, fuel lines, injectors,
brains, wiring, distributor, etc. are ALL DIFFERENT and not interchangable
even with the 914!

> It would be helpful to know what is unique about the 912E engine that

The theory is that because the parts are interchangeable, that the
skills should be. The 914/912E are very different to set up. A high
quality VW "speed shop" like Berg, Kawell, Linenger, etc. should be
able to do this right, because you really need to "blueprint" the engine
in some respects - check the valve timing, maybe modify the cam gear to
adjust it to be right, set the pushrod length, etc. You also *REALLY*
need to know the AFC EFI used on the 912E. It's similar to, but very
diffferent from, the AFC used on both the late Type Is and the 1.8 914s.

> Because 912E was only made for a year, finding someone who has

Yup. You got it. Which is why I offered as a second choice finding a
shop that's done a lot of 914s. *MAKE SURE* they have the 912E
supplement to the 911 manual set!!!

Subject: Re: Are Early 930s Grenades?

I would suggest that the prices for the turbos you've seen reflect them 
needing some major work. They are expensive to repair, and I think the 
maintainence is a little more than a 911. The difference between the 
76-77 turbos and the 78 and newer ones seem to be, the newer ones have 
bigger brakes, bigger intercoolers and aren't as nervous as the 76-77's.
I bought a 78 about 1 1/2 ago for 20k. Since then I've invested(not 
voluntarily) $13k for repairs. I repeat repairs, no upgrades. The 
Porsche shop that did the pre-purchase inspection ( my mechanic was 
vacation, and I was impatient) didn't do a very good job. They felt the 
car would need about $5-6k worth of work within the next two years. I 
was o.k. with that. Imagine my surprise when the price doubled and I 
needed all within a year. I would suggest that if you were going to up 
grade the 76-77s to 78 and newer specs that you just get a '78 or newer 
one. I also think that most any older turbos are going to need some 
major work, unless one found someone who stuck alot of money into one 
and was willing to part with it cheap, highly unlikely. I talked to a 
guy who bought a '79 930 with 6k original mi. He drove it for a few 
weeks and pulled a head stud, apparently the original owner didn't store 
it correctly, what ever that means. $5k later it's on the road again. 
I've seen it for sale recently.
The good news is dispite the high cost, the car is such a gas, and I 
would and will own another. Next time I'll be alittle more patient.

Subject: Re: Blowers of all types.


Ref turbo arrows and fixed waste gates -

To the best of my ken waste gates are always spring loaded, pressure from
the inlet manifold depresses a spring and opens the gate, the main purpose
isn't to reduce back pressure, this is an unfortunate consequence rather
than an evil, it's purpose is to keep the compression ration down below
the point at which detonation occurs, which for gasolene is around 18:1. 1
bar boost on a 8:1 engine obviously gives compression of around 16:1... 

The waste gate in older cars were never directly controlled by the DME,
you would either need a solenoid to open the waste gate - not exactly fail
safe, or would need a solenoid to hold the waste gate closed, if the
solenoid was driven by a transistor the DME would be getting hot!! 

I understand that some turbos now have solenoid operated wgs - dubious 
benefit, personally I like simple reliable systems, wires and hot engine 
parts do not mix well.

SAAB and probably most other manufacturers go close to the 18:1, and to
stop over boost use a knock sensor on the engine, I am not exactly
sure how the knock sensor works, but its action is simple, it feeds info
to the DME, and in the same way as over revs, this cuts a proportion of
the engine sparks. 

Regarding waste gate chatter, if a pressure operated waste gate is changed
out, for example if someone wishes to fit a wg with a different boost
limit, it could be that the new wg has less hysteresis. The wg pressure
feed pipe size has a considerable effect on the wg characteristics- ie a
thinner pipe increases the hysteresis. A wg with a different pressure

I think the reasons that turbo aircraft do not use electronic knock 
elimination are quite obvious - electrics complexity/reliability.

Lou - flying a turbo arrow and running a p-car must count as conspicuous

Well, reading the newspaper I learned that one of the political

to being Speaker of the Assembly here in California. Willie Brown. He 
alone has probably set back the black image in this country to the days

If we could put a catalytic converter in his mouth, we could probably

Our Risk Manager says that your school would have had to know about 
the leak and not taken reasonable measures to prevent damage, or the 
source of the leak would have to have been their responsibilty. If 
some guy on the upper level had a coolant leak and it screwed up your 
paint you will have to go after his insurance.

During the rustoration of my '73-914, I used parts from Tweeks, Restoration
Design, Parts Werks, and Automobile Atlanta.

The thinnest was Tweeks, the thickest was Parts Werks.  But I guess the
Parts Werks parts don't count; they were frame stiffeners.

All the parts fit.  The Tweeks parts needed tweeking.  The Parts Werks
frame stiffeners were a chore.

They ONLY parts that were galvanized were from Automobile Atlanta.  And
one other good thing:  I bought the entire "rust-from-the-battery-typical-
914-kit" from AA, and was allowed to return the unused parts.

The torch-surgeon for my car said to avoid "Pacific-Rim" steel.  Too
thin, and not enough carbon.

Give George a call.  Good steel, good fit, galvanized.  Tell him I want
a discount for this blatant plug.  :)

Subject: 912E rebuilds

I recently did the rebuild on mine (at 225K miles, with a
previous known rebuild at ~140K mi) and here is what I found out:
1) The case bore and crank journals were well within spec
So I did NOT grind or align bore... be
careful if someone wants to do that...check diameters yourself
2) The rods were perfect 
3) No broken rings
4) One very badly damaged valve seat  (the cause of the rebuild...
which was brought about by a dishonest mechanic dropping a screw in
to generate business)
5) Lots of cracks in the heads and lots of evidence of previous
welding on the heads, presumable at the time of the first rebuild.

At that time the engine rebuilders supply guys advertising the Pano
sold 912E kits  (pistons &cylinders, bearings, gaskets, some clutch
parts) for about $550 so I started with that.  The real problem was
the heads.  That will be your problem too.  I could not find any
used heads better than mine, and the "authorities" said mine were
not rebuildable.  Not wanting to pay the enormous cost of new heads,
I kept searching and found the Germans parts and resoration guys in
San Luis Obisbo CA who have a guru welder.  They did indeed do a
beautiful job and the volumes all matched.

The car was terrific after rebuild  (I have since sold it, and have
heard no complaints.)

Be sure to do the sheetmetal and the sound insulation when the engine
is out.

Sean,
Definitely try to get this problem taken care of with your school first.  It 
is always best if the bill is coming out of their insurance.  If you can't 
get this problem resolved, however, and you have to foot the bill yourself, 
you may want to consider self-repair.  If you are at all handy, and are 
interested in tackling such a project, you could save some bucks.  

I assume that since you said "it ate through the paint" that it is beyond a 
compounding job.  Usually the largest and  most expensive aspect of minor 
body/paint repairs is the prep work.  This is not terribly difficult or 
extremely skilled work.  It is just very time consuming, tedious, and 
boring.......hence its high cost.  One of the smartest routes to take is to 
carry out the prep work yourself, and make arrangements for a reputable 
body/paint shop to merely spray or "shoot" the hood with the new paint.  
This should be considerably less expensive, and who would take greater care 
in prepping YOUR car than YOU?  If this idea appeals to you, I'd recommend 
hitting the library/book store for one of the many books on minor body 
repair.  One word of caution, check with the body shop first on the brand of 
prepping agents to use so as not to cause chemical conflict with their 
particular paints.  Overlooking this detail could cause a disaster.

Oh yah, I have some thoughts!  REFUSE their lawyer's explanation of how 
you might not be able to collect, and INSIST that this leak on their

Ah, yes, this is defensive driving in the finest Porsche manner, and is a
practice that all drivers of fine machinery should learn.  It is part and
parcel of the "defensive" package: keeping an eye on the rear view mirror
while braking; looking both ways twice before proceeding through a stop sign;
inspecting the pavement ahead for stray bolts, muffler bits, and pickup
tailgates; and, looking for the least convenient parkig space in the least
accessible corner of the mall or airport parking lot.

In regard to roundabouts, and speaking as a former resident of the U.K. and
an engineer who studied traffic control as part of the curriculum, there is
no doubt roundabouts are better than garden-variety intersections for
improving traffic flow.  With careful design they can handle a tremendous
number of vehicles.  You eventually reach a point, however, where something
else is required.  Just a few weeks ago I found one of those in London,

     The most offensive part of the car crushing program is how poorly the 
     implementation achieves the program's goals.  Let me explain.
     
     The car crushing program is an attempt at removing polluting vehicles 
     from our roads.  Crushed cars earn "pollution credits" for the 
     corporate sponsor(s) of the program.  The rules state that only 
     "regularly driven" cars are to be crushed.  This makes sense.  If you 
     crush an old junker that hasn't run for years, you have not improved 
     the pollution situation.
     
     Now for reality.  What kind of cars do you think people bring to these 
     crush for cash sessions?  You guessed it!  Old junkers that haven't 
     run in years.  Most folks get the cars running well enough to drive to 
     the crusher.  Others tow the car until they get within a few blocks of 
     the crusher.  No pollution solution here.

One obvious reason for not getting an answer is that no one on the
list may know the answer. For example, I do not know if there is a
potential for a galvanic reaction between aluminum and brass/
copper (pun intentional).

However, I do know that engines are designed to run best in a
particular temperature range. Running too cool can be nearly
as bad as running too hot. I am sure that Porsche designed the
cooling system to match the cooling needs of the engine. So,
unless the engine has been modified to produce significanly
more HP, or you are towing a trailer, then you shouldn't need
additional cooling.

Sounds like the micro switch at the front of the sunroof (under the
small black trappiziod) is acting up.  Next time it sticks, try 
wiggling the plastic cover with a very small screwdriver. If this 
makes it open, you can either replace the switch, or do like I did
and clean the contacts.

Subject: Cheap Porsches for sale in NY?

Hi all,

Does anyone know anything about a guy in New York (Long Island area)
that is always advertising Porsches for sale REALLY CHEAP? Their phone
number is (516) 487-0641. They advertise in the Connecticut 
"Bargain News". They usually have about 5 or more late model Porsches
each week, and other sports cars (Esprit, etc). I wonder if they are for
real.

For example, This week they have an '89 928 S4 for $19,995, 
a '74 911 w/ steel 930 body for $7950, an '83 928S for $5950 (needs paint),
and they have had some nice SC's for about $10,000.

I guess they buy at auctions and resell for a profit.
Does anyone know how I can go to these auctions???

Subject: Indexing Spark Plugs in 911 eng

Hi,

I am confused as to how to align the spark plug in a 911
engine for indexing. Many people say "the electrode gap
should be towards the piston" but this does not seem
possible in a 911 engine- the center electrode is pointing
towards the top of the piston, with the outer (bent) 
electrode at a nearly 90 degree angle away from the
top of the piston.

As best as I can tell, the electrode gap should be pointing
towards the center of the combustion chamber. The 911 plug
is not in the center of the chamber, but comes in at an angle
from one side.

Also, some people recommend "towards the intake valve",
which makes some sense. Maybe between the intake valve
and the center of the CC? About 2:00 on the bad ASCII 
picture of the head with valves below? I think anywhere 
from 2:00 to 4:00 is probably OK.

          INTAKE

Manufacturer claims are not always reliable.

My temp gauge stays steady at the mid point except when I am flogging my 83
944 at the track on a very hot day (>100 degrees F)..

There is nothing wrong with the stock cooling system on an early 944, except
the plastic bits...

Back in my sailboat racing days were were always careful not mix brass and
aluminum rudder fittings. (This was in the late fifties when aluminum alloy
[thats aluminium for the educated among us] was just replacing brass in
common usage)

Even in fresh (river) water they would set up a healthy electrolytic action
that resulted in the destruction of aluminum fitting. Granted, these fittings
were in direct contact and immersed in water whereas your radiator is removed
from the block BUT I wouldn't want to risk it.

In response to your response I will say this: 

It is difficult to understand exactly what damage has occurred, and where, 
without being able to see it with my own eyes.  You initially said the 
damage was on the hood.  Did it seep onto other body panels or the front 
nose?  Unless this is the case, there should be no need to remove the 
bumper/nose (which I'm sure is a significantly difficult task).  Perhaps the 
body shop guy told you that to scare you away from the idea of doing it 
yourself (e.g. more bucks for them).  If the damage is confined to the hood, 
the repairing and repainting can be performed with the hood on or off of the 
car, and should not involve any other panels.  The rest of the car would 
simply be masked off when repainting the hood (if it were left on the car), 
or the hood could easily be removed from the car for seperate painting..  
Assuming you would repaint the hood the same color as the rest of the car, 
there is no need for a whole car repaint.  Since your car is 15 years old 
(assuming it still has original paint) you will almost inevitably experience 
some degree of "two-tone" finish.  This very often occurrs in a panel 
repaint due to the aged and oxidized old paint contrasted next to vibrant 
new paint.  Aside of repainting the entire car (more expensive), the only 
real remedy for such a condition is to have the rest of the car 
professionally machine polished by a competant body shop or a good auto 
detailing company.  When done correctly, a thorough compounding/polishing is 
the ONLY way to "save" and restore a worn finish.  This process will allow 
any new paint to blend much more convincingly with an old finish.  

In the end, take everything a body shop man says with a grain of salt.  You 
must realize those guys are in the business to make money.  Unfortunately 
the quality of body shops ranges from superb to extremely poor, and it is 
the consumer's job to find out which.  Always remember that YOU are in 
CONTROL when dealing with a body shop working on YOUR car (even if insurance 
is paying), and don't be afraid to make them aware of that fact.  It is 
definitely to your advantage to fully check out a potential shop before work 
starts.  Even ask to see the work bays, etc.  It may save you from getting 
burned in the end.
Let me know if you have any questions.  Good Luck

Have the car (or at least the hood ) compound polished before sending the
hood out to be repainted.  This will allow the body shop to send the hood
out to their paint supplier for computer matching of the tint.  When I need
the right side of my 22 year old 914 repainted, the shop polished the
dickens out one of the doors and sent it to their paint supplier.  The
resultant match was outstanding.

The easiest way to check what size you need is to actually measure the hole 
itself or the old speakers ( if there are any).  Your fitment is probably a 
4x6, but some 911's have 5x7's.  It is best to check before purchasing.  
There are many other brands of 4x6 's on the market.  Some of the metric 
"4x6 's" will drop in without modification.  These include the Kenwood 
KFC-463-V  metric 4x6 's or the Polk  MM 4620 metric 4x6 plates.  Another 
important measurement to check is the overall depth of the speaker.  Other 
brands may fit with slight modifications to the mounting area, such as a 
mounting baffle or simple bracket.  Keep in mind that any competant 
installer at a specialty shop or electronics chain store should have no 
difficulty in custom mounting a speaker to fit in that area (for a 
reasonable price) if you are not interested in such an install job yourself. 
 Most of the speakers you will find in that size are coaxial drivers, but if 
you are willing to spend a bit more, a pair of 4x6 plates should yield 
better sound.  Plates are composed of a small midrange and a tweeter mounted 
side by side, rather than in a concentric fashion as with coaxials.  Another 
piece of advice is to look to an electronics retailer/chain store for 
speakers.  You will find comparable or better equipment to that in 
Performance Products, at a much better price to quality ratio.  An important 
note in auditioning speakers in the store--an old rule states "if YOU can't 
hear a difference between model A and model B, then don't spend the extra 
money!".  A great source of Mid-Fi aftermarket stereo replacements is the 
Crutchfield catalog.  They have a great tech dept. and excellent return 
policy.  Call 1-800-955-9009 for a catalog.

The following is a brief list of some of the available brands on the market 
currently manufacturing 4x6's.  All of these are descent brands, but you 
must decide what cost to quality of sound ratio you want to achieve.  I have 
starred those brands that, in my opinion, are toward the higher end of the 
spectrum in terms of sound quality.
Hope this was of some assistance.  Let me know if you have further questions.

Subject: Re: Thread on 944 Cruise Control (long)

I've been a listener now for a month and finally decided that I can 
contribute something.  Please forgive the extensive bandwidth and revival of 
an old thread.  Mine (both) and most of the 944s that I know seem to have 
failed cruise controls with the same intermittent problems as previously 
described.  The following is taken from the Service manuals (a Xmas gift 
from my brother who has an '86 951 with 260k miles (he did most) on the 
origninal engine (with chip and adjustable cam - I told him its like giving 
steroids to a 90 yr old man, but it does run really fast!)
     The cruise control unit on the 944 is a completely electronic unit.  It 
is essentially the same on both early and 85/2 models.  The system consists 
of 4 components: 1) the control switches on the directional stem on the 
steering column, 2) the control unit located behind the small cover panel 
above the gas pedal (the unit sits directly over the middle hump), 3) the 
drive unit (under hood behind the front passenger strut support) and 4) the 
clutch switch (near the top of the clutch pedal).
Initial checks:
     1.  Check the cable from the drive unit to the gas pedal.  It should be 
adjusted so the the roller just touches the gas pedal, not tightly when off. 
 If it is tight it will interfere with the throttle returning to idle.
     2. Check fuse (No. 8), this is the same fuse as the brake lights.
     3.  Check the function of the brake lights, if both lights are out 
terminal 8 of the control unit will not get proper voltage.
     4.  Check function of the clutch switch. It should be closed when 
resting and open when the clutch pedal is pressed (see voltage checks 
below).  Manual says 4mm of pin extending when closed. (Damned if I can 
measure this!)
Testing of the Multi-pin plug for the cruise control unit:
     1. With ignition off, pull the multi-pin plug from the control unit.  
There are two screws that hold the unit in.  Remove the screws and pull the 
unit parly out to get at the connector.
     2.  The terminals are numbered left to right looking at the face of the 
connector with the cable to the right, odd on top (1-13) and even on bottom 
(2-14).
     3.  Voltage checks (using terminal 12 as ground):
               terminal 1 = battery voltage
               terminal 3 = battery voltage and 0 volts when control switch 
"off" on control stalk
               terminal 4 = 0 volts and battery voltage when control switch 
"on/accelerate"
               terminal 6 = 0 volts and battery voltage when control switch 
"memory (set)"
               terminal 8 = 0 volts and battery voltage when brake pedal pressed
               terminal 14 = battery voltage and 0 volts when clutch pedal 
pressed
               terminal 11 (Hall pulse generator) when turning left front 
wheel (Jack up car) the reading should rise and drop from less than 1 volt 
to more than 6 volts  per revolution
Testing of the Multi-pin connector at the drive unit:
     1. With ignition off, disconnect the plug to the drive unit
     2. Resistance checks (on connector on drive unit).
               terminal 1 to 7 (engine resistance)  = 3 to 15 ohms
               terminal 2 to 4 (potentiometer) = 2 to 4 kohms
               terminal 2 to 3 (pot. sliding contact) = 2 to 4 kohms
               terminal 5 to 6 (drive clutch actuator) = 30 to 40 ohms
If all tests above are OK, check the wire harness between the control unit 
and the drive for continuity.  These are (drive unit terminal to control 
unit terminal):
1 to 10,  7 to 7, 4 to 9, 3 to 13, 6 to 8, 5 to 5, 2 to 12

        The 85/2 control unit is located on the left side of the drivers 
footwell (above the hood release).  It has 2 connectors, one goes to the 
drive unit, so all tests can be made from these connectors. Connector 2 has 
a coding pin in terminal 3 to insure proper connection.  The corresponding 
pin assignments are:
Plug 1
t1= Speedometer signal
t2 = Brake lights (battery voltage)
t3 = control "off"
t4 = "Terminal 15"(battery voltage)
t5 = control "resume"
t6 = control "on/accelerate"
t7 = "terminal 31"(ground)
 
 Plug 2
 t1 to t2 (Drive clutch actuator) = 30-40 ohms
 t4 to t7 (potentiometer) = 2-4 kohms
 t5 (engine positive) to t6 (engine negative) = 20-30 ohms

The speedometer connection is quite different on the 85/2 since it is not 
connected to a Hall pulse generator.  It can be tested 2 ways:
     1. With ignition off measure about 1 volt below battery voltage between 
term. 1 and battery positive.  With ignition on about 4 volts at 50 km/hr 
driving speed.
     2. An easier test:  Unlock sunroof (ignition off).  Drive at 5 km/hr 
roof should automatically lock (this insures that the speedometer signal is 
present and working). Now measure continuity between roof lifting relay 
terminal A and term. 1 to verify that the control unit is getting the signal..
     If all of these tests are OK, then you need to replace or repair the 
control unit.

In general, your insurance company would deal with THEIR insurance company,

Subject: 944 S2 Maiden Cone Voyage

Ok, so it was only about 10 degrees (that's Farenheit folks!).  So it's
the middle of winter in Colorado.  That's no reason to pass up my first
opportunity to try out my new '90 944 S2 M030 at a local autocross.
 
First surprise was the 245-45-16 BFG rubber stayed square for the entire
first run.  (Did I mention it was cold out?)  Despite the square tires
the car was incredibly quick, very tossable, and extremely easy to bring
back from ludicrous slip angles.  My very first run was a time which Bob
Klingler (defending nat'l champ in CS Miata R--and the guy to whom I
placed 2nd last year) could never match.  To say the least, I was
surprised at the relative ease at which the car can be made to go fast. 
Three of the four runs were within a .6 second band, so it should be easy
to stay consistent as well.    

I need to learn to drive with ABS!  Funny thing, the turns where you know
you need to drop say 30 mph it's easy enough to use the ABS to advantage.
But many turns require only a 10 mph drop in speed, and the temptation
for me was to make sure I felt the ABS pulsation assuring me that my
braking was at optimum levels.  But unless I learn to move my left foot
faster this results in dropping too much speed.  Methinks the best
approach is to forget about having ABS, drive like normal and try to not
even notice when the pedal pulses vs when it doesn't.  Comments?
 
A curiosity:  my 87 turbo sits almost as low as my 944S2 after adjusting
the S2's M030 front perches all the way down.  I thought the M030 car
should be considerably lower than the turbo...are my turbo springs sagged
out?  Or do S2's just start that much higher than turbos?  
 
I love the car so much I just ordered it an enclosed trailer!  Anyone
interested in a really nice 16' flatbed trailer?  Mine will be available
in March.  Tie downs specifically placed for 944 (but easily moved), less
than 1 year old, about $400 below what I have in it.  Delivery possible.
E-mail me for more details.

Subject: Re: No Porsche WSC car



I know this topic might be tiresome, but I just had to share some "posts" to
the CompuServe Motorsposrts Forum on the Porsche WSC car. I've deleted the
names to protect the "innocent."

This is a BIG topic out there, so keep those cards and letters going to:

Lynn Myfelt, IMSA Communications Director
71220.3211@compuserve.com

Larry Wilson

*********************************

1) Would it be possible for someone at RIS to collect the messages posted
here about the rules change and subsequent withdrawal of Porsche and forward
them to IMSA via email?

I sent a message myself 10 mins ago. Hope everyone else will too! I don't
think they realize the significance to fans!

2) It is truly remarkable that IMSA still can't get their act together. Most
of us have wanted them to make the series as big as it can be, but it still
doesn't seem to be in the cards.

Gee...could it be that Ferrari are calling the shots here? Now I certainly
understand IMSA wanting one of their own cars to win, but come on!! 

Porsche has once again invested a ton of dough in preparing a car to compete
in the long races based on the rules printed. I also know how badly Porsche
wish to compete on a fair basis and from my own past experiences know too
that they wished to show IMSA their hand. Guess that wasn't good enough.

My greatest concern is...On what basis did IMSA make this decision? I've
heard all kinds of rumors, but know from drivers that the car couldn't have
any real down force since it was bog slow in the chicane among other places.
So it had decent top speed, as do the Ferrari's. Particularly when Ferrari
trimmed the car out for the big numbers. I guess that IMSA will slow the
Ferrari's cause they smoke Dyson's car on the banking? Not likely!

Not only do I question any reasons to slow the car (oh...I did forget that
the Porsche came within two seconds of the Ferrari's best but who's keeping
track?) but without any true basis, like a race, how do they justify
anything? They sure hosed the car. 

Like my past year in SCCA's WC, the Porsches were constantly being accused
of having too much power 'cause of our decent top speed. But except for
SCCA's crack scrutineers no one took into account the 911 has no frontal
area. Might this be part of the Porsche's WSC advantage?

I've also heard all kinds of off handed rumors about power. The silliest
part is that all the numbers I've heard are the same OR MORE than we used to
run in the unrestricted days. Unlikely. There is no reason for anyone to
think that a Turbo engine can't be controlled, IF the sanctioning body wants
to do so responsibly.

All of this is so very sad and avoidable.

3) I think what you are seeing here is IMSA protecting what little it has
left.  Take into consideration the fact that Skip Barber has taken his
series to SCCA, Firestone has withdrawn their support (Toyo's $ deal isn't
as large), and what you have is a sanctioning body with two series being
buoyed by Ferrari $ (WSC & 355 Challenge). 

4) As a mechanic at TWR who has worked on the Porsche program for the past 3
months,I am very disappointed personally not to be going to Daytona.We have
done alot of hard work and not to get any reward for it by racing is very
hard to accept.Once again the fans are the ones that suffer.

5) Please let me voice my strong displeasure with the actions taken by IMSA
rule-makers last Tuesday (1/24/95) when they decided to place additional
restrictions on the TWR Porsche WSC LM cars.

Most people, who feel the same as I, do not understand nor care about IMSA's
rationale or whatever data that might have been relied on in making this
belated decision. All they understand is that at the last minute IMSA acted
with incredible unfairness and pulled the rug out from an entry that would
have added much excitement and interest to the race and to the Endurance
Series. 

The IMSA explanation placed great reliance on the "lawyer-language" in your
general rules that allowed you to make changes to the WSC LM rules as late
as race-day. But do you really expect most race fans will see that as merely
an effort to enforce equity?

You had an opportunity to explain your actions in plain language -- and you
declined. Instead, you left many with a nagging question of whether your
"focus" on the needs of series-regulars goes beyond the standards of
fairness expected from most sanctioning bodies.

I'm very sad about this whole episode. I usually download the hourly
standings of long-distance races from the Motorsports Forum. Not this
time.

Subject: New 944 owner :)


  Hello P-files!
     Earlier this month I bought my first Porsche.  It is a guards red 1985
944.  I traded in a '91 BerettaGT for about an even trade.  My impressions
so far: I Love it!  I have a huge grin on my face whenever I drive it, and 
for a whlie afterward as well.
   The car has 74k miles on it and still runs very well, but there are 
several questions I have. (I have been unable to find the answers in
several Porsche 944 books/manuals that I have)
    1.  I still don't know if it is a 85 1/2 or just an 85.  The dash
is shaped more like a 924, not the 928's, but is this enough to tell?
I examined the fuel injection, but I have nothing to compare it too.
It has the "telephone dial" wheels, which came with the sport suspension
package.  Are there any easy ways to distinguish between the two.

   2.  I really like the 944 Turbo front bumber style. Is it possible
(i.e. for under ~$1000) to replace the current bumber with a turbo's?

   3.  There are several minor problems with passeneger side door.  The
power window switch (for this side only - driver side control of the 
passenger winodw works) does not work.  Also, the exterior latch does not
release - the door can only be opened if you pull _very_ hard, but there
is no problem opening it from the interior.   Is the removal and 
re0installation of the interior door panel "easy" and/or possible?

   4.  The suspension squeaks.  It seems to handle well, but it is just
noisy.  Should I use any type of lubricant to quiet it (silicon, lithium etc)?

   5.  The previous owner didn't have it aligned reqularly, so I need to replthe rear tires.  I had it aligned (~$100) and had the camber set slightly
negative.  I am looking at Pirelli P600 (215/60 15)  Are these the
correct tire size (car didn't come with it's manual)?  

  Thanks in advance for your help!

Subject: Re: 901 and 915 trannys


Hi Peter,

Well, I'm back home now and looked up some tranny info
for you.  Check out:

 - Bruce's book - it has a section on transmissions
 - European Car, Oct '94 - section on 901 trans (really an Automotion
ad in disguise!  Good for learning how the trans goes together
though)
 - European Car, May '93 - focus on 915 trans oil problems and
why the trans wears out.
 - VW & Porsche, Oct '88 - focus on 914 trans (901) and also
discusses differences between the 901 and 915 trans.  Shows
a picture comparing the 901 and 915 pinion.

Basically, the 915 trans has bigger "guts" and can therefore
handle more power.  You wanted a "rule of thumb" - I'd stick
with Porsche's recommendation and go with the 915 trans
for a 2.4 and larger engine.  I know a guy who uses a 901 trans
in his 2.7L 914/6, but then the 914/6 configuration isn't as
hard on the R&P due to the new direction the ring rotates
towards the pinion - they get much better oil coverage.

If you had a *REALLY* big engine, the choices would seem
to be a G50 or a 915 with an oil pump and spray bar to lube
key areas inside the trans - or with a setup like on page 205
of Bruce's book where there are 6 hoses spraying oil on the
5 meshing gear points and the ring and pinion.  Nice picture,
Bruce - I want one!!!!  :-)

Well, if you had a 901 trans you just *HAD* to use with a larger
engine, think about installing an "oil-spray-lube-system-thingy"
to spray oil at the meshing gears and R&P.  It'll help it last
longer.  Then all you'd have to worry about is snapping the
mainshaft or twisting 1st gear off the shaft due to excessive
torque.  Well....I did say "larger" engine....  :-)

Subject: Open letter to IMSA

Dear IMSA,

I believe you have made a BIG mistake by altering your rules at the last
minute to specifically exclude Porsche WSC cars from the Daytona and Sebring
races. Since they were the only turbo powered entries, you cannot deny that
this was a Porsche-specific move.

IMSA is an organization that was made on the back of Porsche; that you cannot
deny.  Without their cars in the early years, IMSA as we know it would not
exist if it would exist at all.  Porsche has not always won either; witness
the demise of the GTP category when Nissan then Jaguar dominated.

You had a chance this year of having interesting endurance races between
Ferrari and Porsche, something not seen since the early 70's, and you blew
it.  If Ferrari can make their cars last, they will now dominate both Daytona
and Sebring, just like they did last season after their introduction.  Is
this what you REALLY want?  If you don't have enough money to buy a Ferrari,
you can't win.  I thought this was supposed to be cheaper racing then GTP.
 You can't call Ferrari's cheap. They certainly don't fulfill the INTENT of
your rules. So what is the hangup with Porsche?

I find it amazing that IMSA is so frightened of a car maker that uses a 30
year old engine design and has not had a successful entry in prototype IMSA
racing in years.  In fact, their recent history in Indy car racing and
Formula One show that they are not all-conquering as apperently you fear.
They have not had the advantage of a year like Ferrari to tweak their cars.
They already had other significant rule disadvantages.  You COULD have chosen
to let them run Daytona as-is and make "adjustments" between Daytona and
Sebring based on actual race results. You COULD have used the experience to
see if turbo powered cars could be a regular member of IMSA's new series, and
have REAL excitement in your regular season playing off of the
Ferrari-Porsche rivalry.  But for some reason you ran scared.  

This whole episode is a duplicate of the first attempt by Porsche to enter
the Indy 500 in the 70's, only to have a last minute rule change exclude
them.  I thought IMSA was bigger than that.

All in all it make me wonder how much Ferrari is paying IMSA to have
exclusive rights to win.  Ferrari intimidated IMSA last year on the rev limit
issue and kept on winning.  Did they threaten to withdraw support of IMSA if
Porsche could play on a field already tipped in favor of Ferrari?

I urge you to reconsider your move.  It may not be too late to admit an
obvious mistake, and the racing fans of the U.S. and the world would think
better of you for it. Intel learned from their mishandling of the Pentium
computer chip situation.  Maybe you can also learn!

if you weren't able to maintain the proper speed of the, uh, gas stream, it

IMSA don' care about your steenkin' views. If you want somebody to notice,
send your flames to IMSA and a copy to every sponsor of the race coverage --
oil companies, beer companies, tobacco companies, etc. Tell them you were
interested in the race until Porsche pulled out. Now you're going to go play
golf instead of watching ESPN.  (Oh, yeah, write ESPN too.) You're going to
buy their competitors' products. While you're at it, write the Daytona Beach

to do with sport and everything to do with money, and advertising, the only
way to change things is to approach it from that direction -- who controls

Adam Farkas asked about anti-fogging agents, Sekuriflex windshields, and
cleaning them with benzene (a known carcinogen).
 
I think the Sekuriflex windshields have to be marked as such somewhere, like
on the etched or silkscreened-on label. They have a plastic inner layer,
which you should be able to feel with your fingernail (in some out of the
way corner).  They're pretty rare, I think, so odds are you don't have one.
 
The benzene for cleaning the windshields is probably an unfortunate

Well sorta.  Your explanation of the system doesn't quite fit the 944's.  The
944 Turbo has a line going from intake manifold to KLR (just like the DME,
except it's only worried about the turbo and related).  That line is measured
for pressure inside the KLR itself; the KLR then converts this to an electric
signal for use by the boost gage, and of course, to determine if this boost
pressure is too high.  If the boost is below the prescribed pressure for the
rpm, and if the knock sensor isn't sending knock messages to the brain (and the
sun, moon & stars are properly aligned), then the KLR does nothing, allowing the
boost to continue to climb.  Of course if there's a leak in the system somewhere
or if the turbo isn't operating correctly, the boost may not climb at all.  Once
the KLR senses maximum boost for the rpm, it sends a pulse of electricity out
the line to the cycling valve.  This valve is located under the intake manifold,
visible between intake runners 3&4, cylinder shaped, about 2" in diameter, two
inches tall, the top is usually tan, and it has the two wire electrical
connector on top.  The cycling valve has three vacuum/pressure lines running to
it at the bottom of the valve.  One is the input line, one is a line to the
wastegate, and the third is a by-pass line.  When the boost is below max all the
air going into the cycling valve from the input line is directed through the
by-pass, which returns it to the intake system--no loss in pressure and no
wastegate movement.  When the boost hits or exceeds max, the cycling valve
directs the pressure from the input line to the wastegate line.  This, of course
opens the wastegate, venting some boost pressure.  In the 944, it takes only
about .3 bar in the wastegate line (referred to as base charging pressure in the
various manuals) to push open the spring, however, we're trying to get .65 +-.05
bar boost.  In order to permit this much boost the KLR "flutters" or "cycles"
the cycling valve very rapidly, making the wastegate flutter as well.  

The "chuffing" sound the original writer mentioned is very possibly the sound of
this wastegate flutter.  It's hard to guess how loud this sound should be, but
in my car it's only occasionally perceptible at all.  I don't think I disagree
with Peter that this sound could indicate some leakage--however, if you're
getting full boost any leakage must be in the exhaust bypass pipe, where it's
not effecting performance just yet.  In time it could allow faster deterioration
of the wastegate, so you'd want to fix it if you do find a leak.  If you don't
find a leak, and if you're getting full boost, then it's possible your wastegate
is sticky and making more noise than most, or just that you have better hearing
than the rest of us!

To determine if your car is pulling the correct amount of boost, start by
finding out what is the static barometric pressure.  Turn the key to "on", but
don't start the car.  Your boost gage should register 1 bar if you are at
sea-level, less as you climb in altitude.  Here in Colorado (my house is at
about 6500 feet), I get about .75 static bar.  Now add the .65 bar boost to
that.  So at sea level a properly working 944 Turbo (with stock chips) should
make a maximum gage reading of 1.65 bar +-.05; at my house I get about 1.40 on
my gage at max boost.  Remember also, that the turbo doesn't always keep up with
the engine's air consumption in first gear, so it's difficult, if not downright
impossible to get full boost in first.  Better to use third gear, and hold the
car back with the brake at 3500 rpm (this is the method detailed in the workshop
manuals). Be sure not to overheat the brakes.  On 86-88 cars (non S) max boost
should be available at 3500 rpm, then it tails off slightly (down to .45 boost
pressure) from (relying on memory here) 4500-6000 rpm.  A lot of aftermarket
chips get more power by simply not dropping that .2 bar, but I'm leery of
whether or not they listen to the knock sensor to determine how safely they are
managing all that boost.

BTW, the previous thread about adding a turbo to a 912 as an "altitude
compensator" mentioned that these were very low boost, "only" .5 bar.  This is
almost as much as the 944 Turbo gets, and the 944 has been modified extensively
to take the stress!  Yikes!

I love my '87 Cab!

Bad things:
I''ve become obsessive about keeping the (expensive) plastic rear window
scratch-free and clear.
Snap-on boot takes time to install (I know, it's not necessary, but it looks
great!)
Body flex. I don't drive aggressively enough to notice the diminished
handling qualities, but just entering a driveway at an angle causes lots of
creaks, so I know it's flexing 'n bending.
Costs more $$$

The Targa's a great design in terms of engineering, etc. But for some reason,
I'm not crazy about it's appearance. But what do I know about looks, I use to
love my 914.

Subject: Of Chips & Mass Flow Sensors

This little episode has left me with a bad taste in my mouth and it has taken
me some time before I could talk about it, but I think I'm ready now...

A couple of months ago, I mailed a check for several thousands of dollars to
AutoMotion and received back an Autothority (sp?) chip and mass flow sensor
for my low mileage '87 911.

I took the chip and sensor to my local mechanic for installation. The
mechanic gave me a reasonable estimate for the installation. This particular
mechanic has a good reputation: he's says he's installed chips before, he's
active in PCA events, blah, blah, blah. He tells me however, had I purchased
the same chip and mass flow sensor from him for full retail, his installation
price would have been a flat fee. But I saved a couple of bucks by purchasing
the chip and sensor directly from AutoMotion, so the mechanic's installation
price was only an ESTIMATE.

So, while my car's in the shop, the mechanic calls me and says that he's
having problems with the chip and there doesn't seem to be any installation
instructions in the box. I call AutoMotion and they have no idea what I'm
talking about. Then I call Autothority and they FAX my mechanic the
installation instructions. The mechanic is still having problems and after
several calls to Autothority, he consults directly with the chip designer.
Still no luck. 

Next, Autothority sends the mechanic another chip. The mechanic installs the
new chip and I get my car back, but the mechanic tells me that he thinks
there still might be a problem. It seems that when he was testing the car,
every once in a while it would run full rich and stall. Yes, that sounds like
a problem to me, too. He tells me he's out of ideas, but to drive the car for
a while and to let him know if I experience any problems.

Anxious to see what my three thousand bucks bought me, I drive the car to a
section of road that I drove before the chip and sensor was installed to
check my third gear 50 to 100 mph time. The car seems to be running fine so I
let 'er rip. To my astonishment, my time-13.1 seconds-is exactly the same as
it was BEFORE the chip and sensor. Hmm. After driving around town for a while
pondering the implications of all this, the engine goes full rich and stops
dead. I have the car towed back to the mechanic and tell him to put the old
chip and sensor back on. He does so and hands me a bill for almost three
times his original estimate-because of the extra troubleshooting he had to
do-and then has the nerve to tell me that he thinks I gave up too easily!

I sent the stuff back to AutoMotion. End of story. Now, whenever I see an add
for Autothority chips and sensors, I grind my teeth and do a slow burn. 

Comments?

I've seen lots 914 engine fires. You're lucky to have extinguished your '73
with only minor damage. Once the fire gets going, all the water and dry chem
in the world won't touch it. Halon works well if you catch it in time.
Porsche issued a recall on the 914 around '78 - '80 as a result of the
numerous fires that were being reported. I believe they modified the battery
case is some way to prevent rain water from overfilling the cells and
dripping acid onto a fuel line directly below, which was the cause of the
fires.  

I recall responding to an engine fire and seeing the unopened recall letter
sitting on the dashboard of a (formerly) pretty 914.  I recognized the letter

Byron;

    Abs on S2's is great for autocrossing, as you mentioned on large braking
needs it allows for more controlled slowing of the car with full control and
you can concentrate on you line instead of avoiding brake lockup. However
remember that ABS is not a substitute for traction, as I have learned with
worn tires the stopping distance will increase  possibly beyond your turnin
point.  An interesting point which was brought up at a recent Zone 1 Pca
meeting is how does ABS react when a car spins and how do you control it, any
ideas???

In answer to your 85 944 questions

1. Sounds like an early 944 easiest way to tell are the gage faces yellow if
so it is early style.

2. Forget the bumper unless you find one in a junkyard for peanuts

3.  Rt side window seems like a switch real easy to replace, door panel is
also simple just be careful with the clips around the edges of the panel
don't break the vinyl material, while you in there lube the runners for the
window.  The outer door handle is released by a large philips head screw on
the door post then pull it outward at the rear and try to lube, it that does
not fix it then you may have either a linkage rod disconnected ( easily seen
with door panel off) or the handle itself ( a VW part) is broken.

5.  Yes 215/60 15 is the stock size but why Pirelli tires they are overpriced
poor performance and in my experience poor quality, a better bet is BFG,
Yokohama, Bridgestone in a good high performance street version.

Subject: Re: 901 and 915 trannys


Hi Peter,

Well, I'm back home now and looked up some tranny info
for you.  Check out:

 - Bruce's book - it has a section on transmissions
 - European Car, Oct '94 - section on 901 trans (really an Automotion
ad in disguise!  Good for learning how the trans goes together
though)
 - European Car, May '93 - focus on 915 trans oil problems and
why the trans wears out.
 - VW & Porsche, Oct '88 - focus on 914 trans (901) and also
discusses differences between the 901 and 915 trans.  Shows
a picture comparing the 901 and 915 pinion.

Basically, the 915 trans has bigger "guts" and can therefore
handle more power.  You wanted a "rule of thumb" - I'd stick
with Porsche's recommendation and go with the 915 trans
for a 2.4 and larger engine.  I know a guy who uses a 901 trans
in his 2.7L 914/6, but then the 914/6 configuration isn't as
hard on the R&P due to the new direction the ring rotates
towards the pinion - they get much better oil coverage.

If you had a *REALLY* big engine, the choices would seem
to be a G50 or a 915 with an oil pump and spray bar to lube
key areas inside the trans - or with a setup like on page 205
of Bruce's book where there are 6 hoses spraying oil on the
5 meshing gear points and the ring and pinion.  Nice picture,
Bruce - I want one!!!!  :-)

Well, if you had a 901 trans you just *HAD* to use with a larger
engine, think about installing an "oil-spray-lube-system-thingy"
to spray oil at the meshing gears and R&P.  It'll help it last
longer.  Then all you'd have to worry about is snapping the
mainshaft or twisting 1st gear off the shaft due to excessive
torque.  Well....I did say "larger" engine....  :-)

Subject: Open letter to IMSA

Dear IMSA,

I believe you have made a BIG mistake by altering your rules at the last
minute to specifically exclude Porsche WSC cars from the Daytona and Sebring
races. Since they were the only turbo powered entries, you cannot deny that
this was a Porsche-specific move.

IMSA is an organization that was made on the back of Porsche; that you cannot
deny.  Without their cars in the early years, IMSA as we know it would not
exist if it would exist at all.  Porsche has not always won either; witness
the demise of the GTP category when Nissan then Jaguar dominated.

You had a chance this year of having interesting endurance races between
Ferrari and Porsche, something not seen since the early 70's, and you blew
it.  If Ferrari can make their cars last, they will now dominate both Daytona
and Sebring, just like they did last season after their introduction.  Is
this what you REALLY want?  If you don't have enough money to buy a Ferrari,
you can't win.  I thought this was supposed to be cheaper racing then GTP.
 You can't call Ferrari's cheap. They certainly don't fulfill the INTENT of
your rules. So what is the hangup with Porsche?

I find it amazing that IMSA is so frightened of a car maker that uses a 30
year old engine design and has not had a successful entry in prototype IMSA
racing in years.  In fact, their recent history in Indy car racing and
Formula One show that they are not all-conquering as apperently you fear.
They have not had the advantage of a year like Ferrari to tweak their cars.
They already had other significant rule disadvantages.  You COULD have chosen
to let them run Daytona as-is and make "adjustments" between Daytona and
Sebring based on actual race results. You COULD have used the experience to
see if turbo powered cars could be a regular member of IMSA's new series, and
have REAL excitement in your regular season playing off of the
Ferrari-Porsche rivalry.  But for some reason you ran scared.  

This whole episode is a duplicate of the first attempt by Porsche to enter
the Indy 500 in the 70's, only to have a last minute rule change exclude
them.  I thought IMSA was bigger than that.

All in all it make me wonder how much Ferrari is paying IMSA to have
exclusive rights to win.  Ferrari intimidated IMSA last year on the rev limit
issue and kept on winning.  Did they threaten to withdraw support of IMSA if
Porsche could play on a field already tipped in favor of Ferrari?

I urge you to reconsider your move.  It may not be too late to admit an
obvious mistake, and the racing fans of the U.S. and the world would think
better of you for it. Intel learned from their mishandling of the Pentium
computer chip situation.  Maybe you can also learn!

Kyle's comments about lighting them off brought back memories of one of the
zero-level conversations from my college days. (Zero level = they can't get
much lower than this...) Several mechanical
engineering types sitting around, discussing the process of lighting off,
er, petards. We concluded that it could be hazardous to your health, because
if you weren't able to maintain the proper speed of the, uh, gas stream, it
could backflash and cauterize your insides. The proper fix would be to
surgically install a flame arrestor screen. Some stainless steel mesh would
do, or for the budget minded, cut a piece from a 356 SC air cleaner (same
idea: flame arrestor).
 
The empirical discovory by Kyle that lightin' 'em off reduces the, uh,
olfactory offense MUST BE KEPT A CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET. If this gets out,
the California Air Resources Board will require that all patrons of Mexican
restaurants show that they have had CARB-approved thermal reactors (may be

IMSA don' care about your steenkin' views. If you want somebody to notice,
send your flames to IMSA and a copy to every sponsor of the race coverage --
oil companies, beer companies, tobacco companies, etc. Tell them you were
interested in the race until Porsche pulled out. Now you're going to go play

nothin' to do wid bidness. Since modern professional racing has very little
to do with sport and everything to do with money, and advertising, the only
way to change things is to approach it from that direction -- who controls
the money. Change their minds, and you change the rules.
 
In that same vein, does anybody have a list of sponsors of the race, and of

Subject: Never-Fog and Porsche windshields

 
Adam Farkas asked about anti-fogging agents, Sekuriflex windshields, and
cleaning them with benzene (a known carcinogen).
 
I think the Sekuriflex windshields have to be marked as such somewhere, like
on the etched or silkscreened-on label. They have a plastic inner layer,
which you should be able to feel with your fingernail (in some out of the
way corner).  They're pretty rare, I think, so odds are you don't have one.
 
The benzene for cleaning the windshields is probably an unfortunate
mistranslation. In Germany, "Waschbenzin" is just mineral spirits (paint
thinner, turpentine).

Well sorta.  Your explanation of the system doesn't quite fit the 944's.  The
944 Turbo has a line going from intake manifold to KLR (just like the DME,
except it's only worried about the turbo and related).  That line is measured
for pressure inside the KLR itself; the KLR then converts this to an electric
signal for use by the boost gage, and of course, to determine if this boost
pressure is too high.  If the boost is below the prescribed pressure for the
rpm, and if the knock sensor isn't sending knock messages to the brain (and the
sun, moon & stars are properly aligned), then the KLR does nothing, allowing the
boost to continue to climb.  Of course if there's a leak in the system somewhere
or if the turbo isn't operating correctly, the boost may not climb at all.  Once
the KLR senses maximum boost for the rpm, it sends a pulse of electricity out
the line to the cycling valve.  This valve is located under the intake manifold,
visible between intake runners 3&4, cylinder shaped, about 2" in diameter, two
inches tall, the top is usually tan, and it has the two wire electrical
connector on top.  The cycling valve has three vacuum/pressure lines running to
it at the bottom of the valve.  One is the input line, one is a line to the
wastegate, and the third is a by-pass line.  When the boost is below max all the
air going into the cycling valve from the input line is directed through the
by-pass, which returns it to the intake system--no loss in pressure and no
wastegate movement.  When the boost hits or exceeds max, the cycling valve
directs the pressure from the input line to the wastegate line.  This, of course
opens the wastegate, venting some boost pressure.  In the 944, it takes only
about .3 bar in the wastegate line (referred to as base charging pressure in the
various manuals) to push open the spring, however, we're trying to get .65 +-.05
bar boost.  In order to permit this much boost the KLR "flutters" or "cycles"
the cycling valve very rapidly, making the wastegate flutter as well.  

The "chuffing" sound the original writer mentioned is very possibly the sound of
this wastegate flutter.  It's hard to guess how loud this sound should be, but
in my car it's only occasionally perceptible at all.  I don't think I disagree
with Peter that this sound could indicate some leakage--however, if you're
getting full boost any leakage must be in the exhaust bypass pipe, where it's
not effecting performance just yet.  In time it could allow faster deterioration
of the wastegate, so you'd want to fix it if you do find a leak.  If you don't
find a leak, and if you're getting full boost, then it's possible your wastegate
is sticky and making more noise than most, or just that you have better hearing
than the rest of us!

To determine if your car is pulling the correct amount of boost, start by
finding out what is the static barometric pressure.  Turn the key to "on", but
don't start the car.  Your boost gage should register 1 bar if you are at
sea-level, less as you climb in altitude.  Here in Colorado (my house is at
about 6500 feet), I get about .75 static bar.  Now add the .65 bar boost to
that.  So at sea level a properly working 944 Turbo (with stock chips) should
make a maximum gage reading of 1.65 bar +-.05; at my house I get about 1.40 on
my gage at max boost.  Remember also, that the turbo doesn't always keep up with
the engine's air consumption in first gear, so it's difficult, if not downright
impossible to get full boost in first.  Better to use third gear, and hold the
car back with the brake at 3500 rpm (this is the method detailed in the workshop
manuals). Be sure not to overheat the brakes.  On 86-88 cars (non S) max boost
should be available at 3500 rpm, then it tails off slightly (down to .45 boost
pressure) from (relying on memory here) 4500-6000 rpm.  A lot of aftermarket
chips get more power by simply not dropping that .2 bar, but I'm leery of
whether or not they listen to the knock sensor to determine how safely they are
managing all that boost.

BTW, the previous thread about adding a turbo to a 912 as an "altitude
compensator" mentioned that these were very low boost, "only" .5 bar.  This is
almost as much as the 944 Turbo gets, and the 944 has been modified extensively
to take the stress!  Yikes!

I love my '87 Cab!

Good things:
Virtually no wind noise with top up.
Top material very durable.

Styling (I love the way the Cab looks- top up or down).
Very large grin factor w/ top down

Bad things:
I''ve become obsessive about keeping the (expensive) plastic rear window
scratch-free and clear.
Snap-on boot takes time to install (I know, it's not necessary, but it looks
great!)
Body flex. I don't drive aggressively enough to notice the diminished
handling qualities, but just entering a driveway at an angle causes lots of
creaks, so I know it's flexing 'n bending.
Costs more $$$

The Targa's a great design in terms of engineering, etc. But for some reason,
I'm not crazy about it's appearance. But what do I know about looks, I use to
love my 914.

IMHO, buy the Cab Chuck!

Subject: Of Chips & Mass Flow Sensors

This little episode has left me with a bad taste in my mouth and it has taken
me some time before I could talk about it, but I think I'm ready now...

A couple of months ago, I mailed a check for several thousands of dollars to
AutoMotion and received back an Autothority (sp?) chip and mass flow sensor
for my low mileage '87 911.

I took the chip and sensor to my local mechanic for installation. The
mechanic gave me a reasonable estimate for the installation. This particular
mechanic has a good reputation: he's says he's installed chips before, he's
active in PCA events, blah, blah, blah. He tells me however, had I purchased
the same chip and mass flow sensor from him for full retail, his installation
price would have been a flat fee. But I saved a couple of bucks by purchasing
the chip and sensor directly from AutoMotion, so the mechanic's installation
price was only an ESTIMATE.

So, while my car's in the shop, the mechanic calls me and says that he's
having problems with the chip and there doesn't seem to be any installation
instructions in the box. I call AutoMotion and they have no idea what I'm
talking about. Then I call Autothority and they FAX my mechanic the
installation instructions. The mechanic is still having problems and after
several calls to Autothority, he consults directly with the chip designer.
Still no luck. 

Next, Autothority sends the mechanic another chip. The mechanic installs the
new chip and I get my car back, but the mechanic tells me that he thinks
there still might be a problem. It seems that when he was testing the car,
every once in a while it would run full rich and stall. Yes, that sounds like
a problem to me, too. He tells me he's out of ideas, but to drive the car for
a while and to let him know if I experience any problems.

Anxious to see what my three thousand bucks bought me, I drive the car to a
section of road that I drove before the chip and sensor was installed to
check my third gear 50 to 100 mph time. The car seems to be running fine so I
let 'er rip. To my astonishment, my time-13.1 seconds-is exactly the same as
it was BEFORE the chip and sensor. Hmm. After driving around town for a while
pondering the implications of all this, the engine goes full rich and stops
dead. I have the car towed back to the mechanic and tell him to put the old
chip and sensor back on. He does so and hands me a bill for almost three
times his original estimate-because of the extra troubleshooting he had to
do-and then has the nerve to tell me that he thinks I gave up too easily!

I sent the stuff back to AutoMotion. End of story. Now, whenever I see an add
for Autothority chips and sensors, I grind my teeth and do a slow burn. 

Comments?

I've seen lots 914 engine fires. You're lucky to have extinguished your '73
with only minor damage. Once the fire gets going, all the water and dry chem
in the world won't touch it. Halon works well if you catch it in time.
Porsche issued a recall on the 914 around '78 - '80 as a result of the
numerous fires that were being reported. I believe they modified the battery
case is some way to prevent rain water from overfilling the cells and
dripping acid onto a fuel line directly below, which was the cause of the
fires.  

I recall responding to an engine fire and seeing the unopened recall letter

Byron;

    Abs on S2's is great for autocrossing, as you mentioned on large braking
needs it allows for more controlled slowing of the car with full control and
you can concentrate on you line instead of avoiding brake lockup. However
remember that ABS is not a substitute for traction, as I have learned with
worn tires the stopping distance will increase  possibly beyond your turnin
point.  An interesting point which was brought up at a recent Zone 1 Pca
meeting is how does ABS react when a car spins and how do you control it, any

In answer to your 85 944 questions

1. Sounds like an early 944 easiest way to tell are the gage faces yellow if
so it is early style.

2. Forget the bumper unless you find one in a junkyard for peanuts

3.  Rt side window seems like a switch real easy to replace, door panel is
also simple just be careful with the clips around the edges of the panel
don't break the vinyl material, while you in there lube the runners for the
window.  The outer door handle is released by a large philips head screw on
the door post then pull it outward at the rear and try to lube, it that does
not fix it then you may have either a linkage rod disconnected ( easily seen
with door panel off) or the handle itself ( a VW part) is broken.

5.  Yes 215/60 15 is the stock size but why Pirelli tires they are overpriced
poor performance and in my experience poor quality, a better bet is BFG,
Yokohama, Bridgestone in a good high performance street version.

Subject: 951 turbo cooler waterpump


Hi:
I have a problem with my '86 951 and I can't exactly locate it. Each time I
shut off the engine the waterpump for the turbo charger cooler keeps on 
running forever and drains of course the battery. The pump seems to work
fine since I can see the coolant flowing in the expansion tank. I understand
that this may be a thermostat or ATL-relay problem. However, when I remove
fuse #7 (ATL) the pump stops and doesn't start again with reinstalled fuse.
Is there a way to check the relay or the temperature switch for the turbo 
cooler (where is it anyway) ? 

Thanks for any help.

discusses the 911 rear engine handling characteristics and at one point

"Very skilled 911 drivers say that if you do get the car out of shape

I am ready to replace the stock cams in the new (newer) '86 930. The

have measured some SC heads that seemed to be a bit deeper in the head 
dome but yielded about 40/1,000 (i.e. 1 mm) less clearance from the 
seating surface to the edge of the valves. Assuming this is correct, how 
much cam can I safely use? The SC and 964 cams have significantly more 
lift and are a little wider, but since the valve clearance with the 930 
flat top pistons should be within plus or minus 25 degrees of TDC, does 
it really make any difference? All the cams are similar within this 
range. Somebody please wake me up! Thanks.

When you buyu the new lense, buy a european.

Then you can take your extra reflector out and mount it in your

Well the easy way to check this is to swap the relay with a known good

relay and reinserting it.

Do you have any 951 friends, or does the dealer have a car sitting

Hi p-car fans,
In my quest for the perfect solution for a rebuild motor swap options for

Logic FI from CB performance. Heres the claim a 2110cc VW motor (doesn't
give type number) with 8.5:1 compression C.B. magnum heads 268 degree cam
with 423 lift developes 117 hp at 6500 rpms and peak torque at 4500 with
carbs. Same motor with with CBs FI makes 138 hp at 6000 rpms and peak
torque at 5000 rpms.
        The FI kit consists of a custom ECM (brain) four 40mm throttle
bodies 4 injectors to fuel rails manifolds fuel rails fuel pressure
regulator filter throttle posistion sensor MAP sensor temp sensor oxygen
sensor wiring harness with weather pack conections and all hardwear relays,
fuses and brackets are included (they claim). The say its only slightly
harder than carb instalations due to the need to weld O2 sensor into
exhaust. Price is 1500-2000 bucks. They stress that this system is far
better than Porsche and early VW FI. They claim that the older Porsche FI
and VW are open loop systems and theirs is closed. This is what they rest
their claims of better performance. In adition these test were done with a
catalitic converter installed giving emission scores that are aceptable to
the infamous C.A.R.B.
        Any thoughts. This is for a street 914 2.0l. My plan right now is
euro pistons and FAT FI cam the rest bone stock. This modern FI system
interests me. IS it just hype? I shot off a letter to them for more info so
I may post more info if anyone is interested.
Thanks for reading this long mesage any input would be appreciated.

I'm familiar with this system, but have not actually laid hands on it.
Their claims would be on a Type I, in general. I don't think there's a 
Type IV kit yet, and the 914 linkage has to be backwards from the "regular" 
Type IV anyway, so that's another factor (== more cost, too...) I *have* 
used the Berg/HALTECH system which makes similar claims. I've also
gotten *more* HP out of the stock EFI, and engineered my own EFI system
a few years ago, BTW...

> In adition these test were done with a

Yeah, right. Unless it's CARB *certified*, however, that's a big "who cares".
Please check that in the literature, and call CARB to check the certification
number and approved applications.

> This is for a street 914 2.0l. My plan right now is

Sounds like a very good plan to me.

The stock EFI is remarkably effective. Air comes in, gas gets applied, and
you go on down the road at a pretty good clip. You get about 100 HP on an
otherwise stock 914 2.0  using the Euro P&C set.

So, question number one: assume all claims are correct. Is 17 HP worth
$2k?

Question number two: realize that the EFI makes *ZERO* difference in
the equation, except in its ability to respond with more agility to
*OTHER* engine changes (higher compression, more cam in particular).
What are the other mods, and what are their costs?

Question number three: given the other mods needed, and the heat from
the extra HP, what do you need to do to keep your engine alive more
than 10k miles and what is THAT going to cost you?

Question number four: given all this extra cost, is there maybe another
cost? Like how drivable is the car on the street now? Have you just spent
a ton of money on something that no longer meets your basic objective?

You see, to make that extra power, you gotta do something different. Every
time you do something different, you are forced to deal with all of the 
costs and problems associated with, well, re-engineering the engine.
Competent race shops do that all the time. Less competent race shops just
do engine rebuilds all the time from blowing up or breaking engines from
having NOT DONE THE MATH.

Anecdotal item: I have a 2.0 914 with stock bore, stock stroke, factory
EFI. It's been heavily tweaked, as it's a race car. It's legal for
SCCA IT and PCA D2 road racing, and is NOT a street car. Still, it's
interesting to note that it makes over 150 HP on pump gas, and more
on race gas where I can advance the timing a bit more... 

Summary:  you don't need more "tech" to make more power, you just need 
to know how to use what's there.

Last winter when I replaced my coolant, my 944 sprang leaks from both the
water pump and the radiator. I wasn't sure about the radiator, so I took it
to a rad shop for testing. $C30 later I knew for sure - it leaked from
exactly where I thought it would. The rad shop owner offered to build me a
custom brass/copper radiator using my old on as a template. "How much?" I
asked. "How much for a new Porsche radiator?" he replied. I'd already
priced an OEM replacement at a local parts dealer and told him how much
($C300+) and surprise surprise, he said "I'll build you a custom rad for
$C300 less the $C30 you've already paid for the test." He then went on to
tell me about how plastic tanked rads failed too easily and showed me a
Volvo rad that he said was worth $900 and that he'd been asked to build a
brass/copper rad to replace it. I wanted to think about it - I was worried
about fit, didn't even think about aluminium vs. brass/copper - and went
away. I called around and found a used rad for $150 and drove for an hour
each way to pick it up. I had it tested for $30 and it failed too. "Are you
sure you don't want me to build you a real rad, I used to run a stock car
team, you know, and we built all our own rads - and they work real good."
"No, I've still got to think about it... ." I talked to a few people at
work - didn't know y'all yet - who know cars and they recommended the sure
thing *and* remain true to Porsche. and that's what I did. No new leaks
yet.

That's the long of it. Sounds like your price is way out of whack since you
can divide $C by about 1.4 to 1.5 to get $US. I ended up paying $C295 + 14%
tax for my OEM rad. It fit and worked right first time.

If anyone's still reading, I would like to know more about the effects of
phosphates on the 944 cooling system. I used the yellow bottled Prestone
since it the label said it was safe for Aluminium engines. In light of
recent comments, I'm not so sure now.

In France (and in UK too), the priority is given to the people on the
roundabouts *except* in Paris.

There, it's the other method: you have to give way to people coming from your
right side.  So people that want to go on the roundabout have priority and not
those who want to leave !

IMO, the first solution is the safest and the best to avoid traffic jam on the
roundabout.  You can't get in if there's no room for you.  It have to first let
people get out and then others come in.

The second solution, used in Paris, is not efficient when it's crowdy (the round-
about looks like a mess) and is *very* dangerous when the traffic is normal or
light.

Tourists: be carefull!  In Paris, people have not right of way when they are on
your right side: they simply rush, without caring if you'll stop !


My $0.02:  if you want to survive to the roundabout's jungle in Paris, try my
method:
( disclaimer: this is the way I do it.  I don't say it's the *best* solution)

 - rush on the roundabout, other people will let you come in,

 - stay on the very right side of the round,

 - when you see the next crossing with an avenue, you'll see all lot of people
stopped (they're letting people from their right pass).  Try to reach the posi-
tion on the rightest side,

   ( drawing the intersection of a roundabout and an avenue is so
   difficult for an non-ascii-wizard-drawer ! )


 - go as soon as possible and then you'll have right of way untill the other
crossing,

 - don't forget to leave the roundabout where you have to !

 - NEVER stay close to the the center of the roundabout.  That's the best way to
turn and turn and turn without beeing able to leave the roundabout.

From: Steve "THRUD" Cook <steve@prism.nmt.edu>
	   The car has 74k miles on it and still runs very well, but there are 
	several questions I have. (I have been unable to find the answers in
	several Porsche 944 books/manuals that I have)
	    1.  I still don't know if it is a 85 1/2 or just an 85.  The dash
	is shaped more like a 924, not the 928's, but is this enough to tell?
	I examined the fuel injection, but I have nothing to compare it too.
	It has the "telephone dial" wheels, which came with the sport suspension
	package.  Are there any easy ways to distinguish between the two.

AFAIK, if it has the 924-style dash, it's an 85/1.  I think the dash is one of
the big changes they made.  I'm not sure if there's any other simple way to
tell.  VIN, probably, but I wouldn't know where the line of demarcation is.
	
	   2.  I really like the 944 Turbo front bumber style. Is it possible
	(i.e. for under ~$1000) to replace the current bumber with a turbo's?

Good news: Performance Products lists the turbo bumper conversion at $449 in
their spring/summer '94 catalog.  Bad news: the light kit to complete the
conversion is >$700.  Not sure if you really need the light kit, my guess is
there will probably only be one light you can't get, but it'll be only available
as part of a kit.  Maybe check w/ auto recyclers (love those p.c. phrases!) in
your area or the back of Pano and see if you can get a front bumper and light
package.

	   3.  There are several minor problems with passeneger side door.  The
	power window switch (for this side only - driver side control of the 
	passenger winodw works) does not work.  Also, the exterior latch does not
	release - the door can only be opened if you pull _very_ hard, but there
	is no problem opening it from the interior.   Is the removal and 
	re0installation of the interior door panel "easy" and/or possible?

I'm sure it's possible, not sure how easy it is.  I have to take my driver's
side door apart to fix the lock sometime this spring, but I haven't taken the
plunge just yet.  Get a copy of the Euroselect parts catalog -- it shows a lot
of exploded diagrams of various 924/944/928 assemblies.  Not sure if it shows
the door (I don't think so) but it's a nice book to have.
	
	   4.  The suspension squeaks.  It seems to handle well, but it is just
	noisy.  Should I use any type of lubricant to quiet it (silicon, lithium etc)?
	
Sorry, can't help you here.  I think Wurth makes a grease that other owners
have recommended, but I don't recall any details.

	   5.  The previous owner didn't have it aligned reqularly, so I need to replthe rear tires.  I had it aligned (~$100) and had the camber set slightly
	negative.  I am looking at Pirelli P600 (215/60 15)  Are these the
	correct tire size (car didn't come with it's manual)?  
	
Yep, that's the size (assuming you've got the same 7" phone dials I have).  I
just bought a set of Comp T/As and I regret not going with the 225/50R15 size.
Something to think about if you want to go racing...  You might also want to
head down to your dealer and see if you can get a replacement owner's manual.
It's tough figuring out how to get the sunroof off without one!

Congratulations on your new car!

Subject: Re: Of Chips & Mass Flow Sensors


I haven't seen any comments about the Autothority system on the net, so 
maybe I haven't been paying enough attention. However,some time ago, we 
decided to develop a system to compete with the autothority system and 
decided that the easiest way to go would be to switch from mass air to 
speed density and work entirely from manifold pressure. This would allow 
the restrictions ofthe mass air meter to be removed entirely. We did 
get  a system developed and proven in Europe and then lost interest in 
it when we couldn't find a 911 locally to test it out on.

Now we have this system lying around and this thread has prompted me to 
resurrect it. The question is, does anyone want to  
try it out. It needs someone with mechanical knowledge because I do not 
want to get into the questions of who is paying the mechanics fees. We 
will proivide all ofthe support needed from here and at the end of the 
day, the volunteer may keep the system free of charge if they want to. If 
it works as well as the Autothority system, they probably won't want to:)

There are no guarantees, except that it won't cause any damage to the car 
and nothing needs changing, which can't be changed back in a few minutes. 
I would initially suggest wiring it in and testing it wiithout removing 
the existing MAF sensor from the car. That way, if there are any 
problems, it can be returned to stock easily.

Any volunteers?

Subject: Targa Rubber Seals

This sounds like a trivial/dumb request, but...

If anyone out there has a '87-'89 Targa, can you measure the length of the
front rubber seal from the corner where the targa top meets the windshield
and the triangular door window .. down to the point where the rubber seal
meets the hollow door seal rubber.  Please measure from the top of the
flared fat section at top corner to the junction at mid-door.

Reason:  I am replacing all the cockpit rubber.  On my car, the installed
original seal is approx. 22" long in this section.  So far I've
ordered/returned 2 replacements.  The latest one is of the correct design, but
is approx. 19" in this section.  I don't know If my car is the anomaly or if
the replacement parts are incorrect.

At this point, I'm not sure if I should return it and try again, or accept
the 3" difference and fill in the void area with something else.

I'm not  a pilot, but am pretty familiar with such coatings. In "serious"
racing circles, it's pretty much the rule of the day.

There are basicly four types of coatings in use routinely:

* teflon coatings for increasing oil shedding properties of parts,
* high-pressure teflon coatings for moving part contact surfaces
  like bearings and journals,
* semi-metalic ceramics for heat sheilding (like the ceramichrome you 
  mention), typically used on piston tops, valve faces, combustion
  chambers, etc
* high-gloss high-temp ceramics used for heat sheilding, (like Jet-Hot)
  used for exhaust ports in heads, and header systems.

For a race engine, you really need all of this if you're running in a pro
series. Your competition has it, you need it to maintain parity. Does it
make the car faster, last longer, etc??? Yes. Absolutely. You can even 
measure it on the dyno and engine life clock. Can you "feel" it?? Not
really, except in the wallet...

For a street engine, the high-pressure teflon coatings are always a good
idea, but it's not really a requirement or even necessarily better
than not doing it. I just feel more comfortable with it in some cases.

My vendor of choice for all this stuff is Polymer Dynamics in Houston, TX.
They do a lot of work for IMSA, SCCA, NASCAR, IROC, etc. and have a very
good reputation.  Swain Tech is also reputed to be good, but PD is local
and I can go grab them by the twisty bits when they screw something up.

I don't want to go poking holes in something I haven't seen personally, 
but this is close enough to something that I spent a LOT of time chasing
and spent a  LOT of money on, so:

The problem with this is often answering the question "which manifold
pressure". Both Kevin Gross and I had *ENDLESS* trouble making the
Electromotive TEC system work with high-butterfly throttle bodies, until
we discovered that it required a common plenum, at which point we
both lost interest for what should be obvious reasons. In fact, the
guy I was doing this work for said that if there was someone I didn't
like that I could *GIVE* them the Electromotive unless I *REALLY*
didn't like them in which case I should *SELL* it to them...

Similar issues apply to any other system based on manifold pressure.
At face value, it looks like a replacement for a DME, which leads to
the question  of "why bother". If you're going to an aftermarket programmable
EFI, then you *REALLY* want to be able to use high-butterflys or 
slide-valves. If you can't do that, then well, why not modify a factory
system?

They used some cycle of nickel/nichrome, stainless steel and ???.  They were
said to provide great lubrication and heat dissipation, but racers were

Well, another autocross season is coming around, and I'm in the market
for tires for my '73 2.0.  I thought I'd seek the collective wisdom
of the list for some recommendations.

I'm running in stock class - which means no "sticky" compound tires.
We're limited to tires that have a wear rating of at least 120.
My first inclination is to go with Yokohama AVS Intermediates in
a 205/50/15 - but I have a couple of questions:

1) Do you know of a better tire (i.e. stickier) that will still
   keep me in stock class?

2) Will a 205/50 fit on the standard Fuchs rims - and under stock
   fenders, for that matter?

E-mail to me is fine - I'll post the results that I get for 
everyone's interest!

I'd regard it as necessary, especially if you want to keep the top looking 
nice.  BTW, the cover has two kinds of snaps, the regular snap, and the
kind with a knob that you must  Lift and hold while you fit the thing over
a post, then release (and push down on, to ensure secure engagement).  I don't
know what the later are called (*expensive* if you ignore the proper proceedure
for securing them and have to replace one or two).

also, if you get the tonneau cover which replaces the normal boot, that's cool
also (and a real pain in the *ss to mess with, but it *is* cool)

I cannot recall ever responding to a 924 engine fire. My fire agency only
responds to 100 - 200 auto fires per year. That's why the 914 issue really
got my attention; we've had so many of them. I must say however, that the
numbers have dropped way off after the recall. 

Perhaps a fire department in a larger city might have better numbers to draw
from. I do not believe the state Fire Marshal's offices categorize car fires
by make and model, at least California does not. If you're interested, I'll
bet some of the larger insurance companies keep those kind of figures.

Don't think I like this idea.  Though I have heard this advice given as
a foolproof way of getting an aircraft out of a spin !

Friend of mine was spinning an airplane inverted and couldn't recover,
after struggling with it for a while he decided it was best to leave.
He let go of the controls and started wiggling the canopy open, while
he was doing this the airplane recovered by itself.

Not sure I'd want to try that in a car though, for one thing you're a
little too low to get your 'chute open properly before you hit the ground.

ok, here's what I know.

cermichrome is a brand name of a process that was invented (by a britisher
I think) for mercruser outboards years ago.

instead of having a soft cylinder wall and hard rings it goes the other way
and has a hard cylinder wall and soft rings.  it's basically an evolution
from chrome cylinders.  in cyl walls in general you have lots of little
grooves, a certain number of a certain size crossing at certain angles all
supposedly optimized differntly for different engines.  in soft steel cyls
these are honed in.  in chrome the plating charge is reversed quickly at
the end of the plating process to cause the plating to crack.  in ceramic/
chrome these are little tiny chips of ceramic pressed into the cylinder
wall while the chrome is still soft.  the quality control is done (i think)
by shining a beam of a known thickness down the cyl wall and counting the
reflections from the ceramic.  it's not 100%, only one pass each cylinder.

I have recently (after much deliberation) had this done on my Lycoming
O-320-E2G (with the high comp. pistons mod).  Several of my flight have
also had this done.  the cv (no hard evidence) is that oil consumption
is lowered, perhaps wear, who knows.  have seen no difference in temps.
my experience is that oil consumption is lower, but who knows whether it's
because of the cermichrome cyls or just because it's a "new" engine.

Subject: Re: 356 in need of help 


Did you put larger jets in your carburetor when you put in the larger
cylinders?

A carburetor will spit and pop when the mixture is too lean.  The
larger cylinders draw more air through your carburetor than do smaller
cylinders at the same rpms and make the fuel mixture leaner if the
amount of gas isn't increased to compensate.  Your idle mixture
adjustment will allow your carburetor to add more gas to the engine at
idle and low rpms, but at higher rpms the only way to add more gas to
the mixture is by increasing the size of the jets.

I believe the best way to find the correct jet size for your engine
with big bore kit is to put the car on a chassis dyno, but I'm sure
others on this list have lots more experience doing that than I.  (In
the Bay Area I understand that Rockwell Motor Sports in San Jose does
a good job at this.)

Perhaps someone else can give us some pointers?

Hope this helps!

Subject: Making and external oil thermostat


Hi gang,

A friend of mine has no cash and is planning on making
his own version of an external oil thermostat similar to the
$140+ versions sold by a variety of people.  (No flames
please....I've heard them all about how Porsches and
no money don't mix!)

His plan is to use the factory 911 thermostat which sits inside
the engine (since a friend of his has about 50 of them laying
around).  He thinks all he needs is to have a block of
aluminum milled to the dimensions of the round factory
piece with 4 threaded holes for the fittings and a couple
of mounting tabs.

He found a good machine shop that will provide the aluminum
and do the millwork for about $40 CDN ($29 US).  The factory
thermostat will slip-fit into the block with an o-ring seal and
will screw into place.

As long as there are no leaks, does this sound feasible?
Did he miss anything?

Thanks,

Allan

Hmmm, it doesn't work in all airplanes either (and probably not for all
spin modes of any particular aircraft for that matter).  The first planes
I did spin training in would recover on their own if you stopped fiddling
with them, but then we switched to another type that required very
positive action to stop the spin (and I wasn't doing inverted spins...).

Anyway, if you have tons of room so you're not going to hit anything, it
might work in a 911.  But then it wouldn't really matter what you did.  I
suppose you just might recover faster by letting go of the wheel in some
situations - at least it would eliminate DIOs (driver induced oscillation).
I have successfully reversed the direction of a spin in a 911 before
(unintentionally of course)...

Subject: Brighter Headlights - NOT

I've often seen the ads for "brighter headlights" in the back
of autoweek, so got a pair for my Grand Cherokee V-8, hoping
they would work great on such a high vehicle.

The bulbs are the "9004" style used in most vehicles nowadays.
They have 50 watt low/100 watt high or 80/100 available. I got
the 80/100, as I use mostly low beam around town here.

The bulbs are PHEOBUS brand, made in Korea (yuk). I got mine from
Performance Products' Panorama ad much cheaper than the autoweek
prices. These are the same brand as some if not all of the ones
advertised in Autoweek.

Anyway, there was really no noticable difference in brightness with
these bulbs. There is no way these are putting out 100 watts. I used
the "real" Cibie halogen headlights (H4) years ago in my 914, when they
were not legal in cars, only motorcycles (they were not sealed beams,
but had replaceable bulbs). They made a huge difference, much brighter
than these on the Jeep.

So I guess these bulbs are OK as a replacement if you blow a bulb, but
don't waste your money on them as an upgrade. And we'll see how long
they last.

Also there is a problem with the new non-sealed beam headlights
today. I noticed the 2 year old headlights on the Jeep were getting
dirty (cloudy?) inside already. I wonder how they will be 10 years
from now, or if they can be cleaned? They are pretty well sealed,
but grime gets in anywhere it can I guess...

Subject: RE: Gold welding lenses


Hi Kyle,
I hope you get this message before you are gone for good....

A friend of mine bought a welding handbook and in it was
a statement like "Don't use the 'gold' type of welding lenses"
because if it is scratched, UV can now enter your eye through
that scratch since the gold is the part that protects your eyes.

It seems a little more "dangerous" to use your favourite lens
than a regular dark shade 9 or 10 lens.

Hmmm....just letting you know.  I think the book was one put
out by HP.

Take care of yourself....and good luck with your 914 rustoration.

  Allan, relax man.  I'm just off-the-net, not leaving planet earth (N'yuk, 
n'yuk, n'yuk).
  -It got to be too much during school. . .since my employer is footing the 
bill, I feel
like I should give 'em a fair workday.  And all my other spare time is 
consumed doing
homework.  (I'm a freshman in college -at 40!)
  But that wont last forever, once I find the handle on the semester, I will 
be back.

  As to the 'Omni-View'. . .  Yeah, I knew the job was dangerous when I took 
it.
  But those #6 shades work great (and last a long time) when sandwiched in
plastic plates.  I just replace the plates, and the shade remains like 
perfect.
  I dont even dust them off (wash with soapy water) so they dont  get 
scratched!
  Yeah, if scratched, they leak UV.  I am well aware of that hazard in 
conjunction
with using these special shades.  The gold is just vapor deposited, and VERY 
thin.
  -just another caveat to watch for.

  Waaayyy back when I was shooting the breeze with the welding shop guys, we
talked extensively about the Omni-View shades.  Apparently, the amount of 
power
in the arc is the key factor in how light a shade one can get by with.  For 
us
Pudknockers with <100 amp MIGGERS, the arc power level is low enough that a
trick lense like a shade 6 or 7 (gold Omni) is just fine!!!    BIG arc 
machines
with well over 100 amps of arc current would demand the extra filtration a 
#10 shade provides (but these are available in gold film too).

  The Omni-view shade uses a UV filtration method that differs from standard
shades in that the shield plate contains the light attenuation, and the gold 
film provides UV filtration.  Since the film 'blocks' the UV, the shade 
itself can be less dark and still provide suitable protection.  That is why 
a scratched shade is a throwaway.

  Thanks for the concern!
  -and nice to hear from you!

Subject: 951 oil scum question

Hello Phellow Philes;

I need opinions on a problem I noticed while adding oil to my '89 944 Turbo 
today.  Upon inspecting the oil level this morning, I found that I was about 
half way between the upper and lower marks on the dipstick.  I decided to add 
about half a quart of Castol Syntec 5W-50.  When I removed the oil filler cap, I 
found a yellow scum on the underside of the filler cap and some around the 
inside of the oil filler tube.  There was no similar scum on the dipstick.  On 
my last oil and filter change about 1K miles ago I switched from Mobil 1 
synthetic 15W-50 to Castrol Syntec 5W-50.  Prior to that the car had whatever 
the dealer put in (non-synthetic).

Have any of you synthetic oil users experienced similar problems of scum 
'growing' in your oil after oil changes?  Any thoughts would be appreciated.  
Thanks in advance.

clips out of the door one by one.  Oh yeah, theres one screw also behind 
the door handle, and the window crank must be removed by pulling the

had to sell 912E #1.  A VW mechanic who also owns a '76 914 2.0 offered 
me $12,000 for it as is, and considering my situation its the only way to 
go.  I know the guy, and he will take good care of it and wants to 
restore it to concours original condition.  Its better the car be in the 
hands of someone who has the means to restore it proprerly.  Though I 
didn't intend the car as an investment, doubling your money in two weeks 
isn't bad.  I can see the headlines now "Porsche saves owners credit 
record".  I told him about how helpful this list has been, so he might 
get a Net account and join the list.  He's going to tow it away tomorrow, 
and my garage will be empty of its spirit.  Yes, I still have my 924 but 
its not the same.  I only wish I was rich enough to keep it, and I'll get 
along OK with my "budget" Porsche.  Here's to a lost opportunity.

For early 911/912 (from 69 912).

Tail light lenses. Red w/chrome trim. In ok condition. Some small cracks 
around the screw holes but still whole and usable.

Boge rear shocks. I think there still ok. Got some new ones for a good deal
or I would have left these in.

Stock shifter, chrome but used.

Bursch 912 exhaust. Still on the car but I'm planning on putting the original
back on, this one is too loud for me. In very good condition. Chrome tip.

Momo 320mm Monte Carlo steering wheel w/hub, good to excellent condition.
Too small for my taste, I put the original back on.

Reasonable offers accepted, Buyer pays shipping.

not a sythetic user but I have seen a buildup of what I assume is an
oil/water emulsion (yellowish waxy residue) on the inside of my oil
cap and inside the filler neck.  This is only in the last couple of
months.  I believe this is due to low temps, wet air and the fact that
my (911) engine doesn't reach operating temps quite on my short (10
minute) commute on these cold days.  I'm guessing this is simply
water condensation inside the filler neck which will go away if/when
then weather gets warmer or if/when I get the engine nice and hot for a
prolonged period of time.

I have used Mobil 1 15-50 in my 931 for the past 3.5 years.  I have
never seen this yellowish 'scum' on the filler cap (or anywhere else).

My turbo does produce the characteristic light brown 'milkshake foam'
in the oil return and breather lines (one of which vents at the oil
filler cap), but that sounds like something different.

Subject: 931: Oil in the PCV air

A recent thread reminded me of this question to those with the turbo
blooded P-cars...

My 931 air filter usually dies a premature death because of oil
mist/vapor that is blown into the filter box by the PCV line.  ( With
the engine hot and running and the box open, I can see 'smoke' issuing
from this tube, and it coats my entire induction system with a brown
varnish.) This, despite the fact that the PCV line contains an oil/air
separator canister.  I use Mobil 1 15/50 oil. 

Should I explain this as:
1) Normal behavior for a 14 year old engine,
2) a result of the turbo oil frothing, or
3) abnormal, such as from a clogged drain line or separator??

Anyone with similar experience or other wisdom?

Just make sure that isn't anti-freeze. Check if there's scum in your
radiator overflow tank. If so, I'd get it checked. The seals in the oil
cooler could have shrunk with the change in oil <shrug>. It happened to
quite a few early '87's, though they were non-turbo's.


Hoping that not's it,
Craig.

I've baby-sat three pre-SC to Carrera upgrades in the last year, including

Sorry about the confusion.  Simplistically speaking, a baffle is any panel 
into which a speaker is mounted.  A custom baffle board can be made to allow 
a speaker to fit into a space where it would otherwise be too small.  The 
important thing to remember when mounting speakers, that the front of the 
cone should be separated from the back of the cone.  That is to say that if 
you were to hold a raw speaker in the palm of your hand, that the front of 
the cone would NOT be separated from the rear.  Only once a speaker is 
mounted into some sort of baffle (a board/panel with a hole in it the size 
of the speaker) are the front and rear properly separated.  When the cone of 
an operating speaker resonates back and forth it creates waves of compressed 
and rareified air (sound waves) on BOTH the front and back sides of the 
cone.  These waves are out of phase, however, (i.e. 180 degrees apart with 
respect to time) which will cancel each other out if they are not physically 
separated some how.  In other words, the front of the speaker must play into 
a different "air space" than does the rear of the speaker.  This separation 
is accompolished through the use of a baffle board, into which the speaker 
is mounted (this is the same reason why home speakers come mounted in 
"boxes" or "cabinets").  If the space where you wish to mount the speakers 
does not closely conform to the size of the speaker itself, you need to 
fabricate a "baffle board" ( such as 0.25 inch plywood ) with a 4x6 hole, 
then mount it to the car, and in turn the speakers are mounted to the board. 
 You should take care in mounting speakers to seal the mounting lip of the 
speaker to the panel on which they are mounted ( weather stripping foam 
works well ) to prevent front to back air leaks.  This discussion may be 
more than you were looking for, but hopefully it will help you achieve 
better sound.  Believe it or not, the small details can make the difference 
between a good install and a poor job.  If you are unsure as to whether you 
need a baffle board or not for your specific car, most pro installers are 
more than happy to give a bit of free friendly advice after looking at your car.

>have the same DEPTH ? (ie, as long as it's a 4x6 speaker, will it fit in my 
>rear deck with no modification to the deck ) ?


NO! ABSOLUTELY NOT.  That is why it is important to measure not only the  
length x width, but also the depth of BOTH the speaker and the car.  If 
these numbers conflict (in any one of the three dimensions), then the 
speakers won't directly fit the mounting hole.  That is why I said that a 
"mounting baffle" might work to adapt a speaker to a particular opening.  
Not only can a baffle be used to help fit a speaker into an opening, but by 
varying the thickness of the baffle (i.e. 0.25 inch wood, 0.5 inch wood, 
0.75 inch wood) it can act as a shim to effectively decrease the depth of 
the speaker that must recess into the opening.

Just a little aside, there is nothing like a small, high-quality, hi-fi amp 
used to power your system to help overcome the road/engine noise in your 
car.  Unless you only listen when parked, the higher power will allow you to 
hear music at regular levels much more clearly and distortion free than with 
the 3-5 watts supplied with many decks.  That was just something for you to 
ponder.  Everybody says that they are not concerned with sound 
quality.......until they hear a true hi-fi system, and it gives them a 
perspective for comparison.  Just some more brain food.

Chuck, 
   I have to put in my (obviously biased) vote for a Targa.  Reasons:

 -For some reason, I like having a ragtop that doesn't LOOK like a ragtop.
 People are generally surprised when I take off the top.  Not that a serious 
 thief would be thwarted, but the kids down the block might not figure out 
 that they can just put a knife through the Targa.  The cab is too obvious.
 I prefer a bit of understatement.

 -I like having a real, glass rear window that can be scraped of snow, has
 a defroster, gives excellent rear viz (better than a coupe?).  

 -I really like the look, but this is clearly subjective.  (I also like the cab,
  but I'll take the Targa.)  But then again "Degustibus non est desputandum,"
  (or is that "Chacon a son gout" ?)

 -While it has been pointed out that resale values for cabs are high, this means
 that you have to PAY more to get one (right?).  

Cons:
 -My seals are beginning to leak up front. 
 -Sometimes there are no substitutes for a full-blown ragtop.

   As a final thought, there is one thing I really like about my P-car.  It
is a *practical* supercar.  Great looks, handling, acceleration, cornering, 
etc.  But it doesn't have the driving position of an F1 racer (like a Lotus),
it can carry enough luggage for a two-week trip for two (unlike a Ferrari),
can seat one or two in the back in a pinch (unlike a 'Vette).  Hell, mine
can run happily on regular gas.  Somehow the Targa fits into that niche 
better than a cab does.  Full glass? Yes.  Open top?  Sure. As structurally 
stable as a taxi?  Well....did I mention the full glass?

Dear Mr. Snarkler:

          If you used the Big Bore Kit with a  356B Head AND you only used
only  one thin (0.25mm, .010") copper base gasket, then the pistons may be
hitting the spark plug electrode, especially if you used extended tip plugs
like the Bosch W6BC.   Check your old plugs to see ifin the gap has veen
drastically reduced! 
      If the plug gap is OK, try  checking the timing first (should be 3-5
deg static advance and 30-35 degrees Total High Speed advance (above 3000
RPM). Then, after that's done, try adjusting the mixture screws of the
Zeniths. If you  find one mixture screw that doesn't adjust well, you may
have a clogged idle jet. A quick test for a bad carb or cylinder is to find a
long, straight, deserted road, pop off one linkage arm and drive on one carb.
It'll drive poorly of course, but should get to 45-50 MPH. (My engines are
able to break the National Standard of Mediocracy on one carb.) If you get up
to 45-50, stop. Replace linkage arm, pop off the other one and drive on other
carb.  If the car don't go no mo', you've got a bad carb on that side. 
If one carb will only do 25 MPH, you have a bad cylinder. Pull off one plug
wire on that side. If you pull of the Bad one, it'll still do 25. If you pull
off the Good plug wire, it won't move!  
    This is my Binary Search tyechnique to find out which Carb or cylinder is
bad with only a couple of tests.
  KEEP THE 356 FAITH!

This problem sounds more related to poor engine oil control than to a turbo
related problem. The oil from the turbo just dumps out into the (top of the)
oil pan and should not go into suspension (hence ending up in the air
filter).  My 931 also shows signs of oil on the filter  - though not to the
same extent that your car does Mike.  Does your car smoke at all?  (maybe on
gear changes or during high boost conditions - maybe needs new rings?)
As an aside, EBS (Engine Builders Supply or something), who advertises in
European car has a high(er) performance rebuild kit available for the 931
with 8.0:1 CR pistons - for $700 which is not too bad - I am not sure what
else is included in this kit though.  I sent for their catalog several months
but have had no response yet.  When I rebuild someday I will consider some
sort of [quality] alternative to the stock bits.  What would a set of stock
931 pistons cost I wonder?

     Before you rush into this, I thought I'd add my 2p worth.  I believe 
the Bosch (=Autobahn at your friendly VW/Porsche/Audi dealer) are the best 
blades I've used and seen.  They are a little expensive but I think they 
hold up well over time.  Besides, new arms couldn't be cheap.  I think the 
way you can replace just the inserts works pretty well.
     If this seems to be my personal opinion and no one out there likes, 
just let me know.  But I've had good luck with the Bosch blades over the 
years.

My 86 Carrera came with pretty chrome/matched paint wheels. Don't know their

their own maintenance man. Anyone have any suggestions, or a good set of

This is moisture trying to escape your oil pan.  It accumulates from 
high humidity levels typically, and is fairly common.  Make sure you 
change the oil frequently to remove this moisture (and other dirt, 
etc.) from the oil.

Sometimes water in the oil is caused by a head gasket or oil/water 
intercooler seal leak.  If this is happening you'll see/smell 
antifreeze in the oil, and maybe oil scum in the antifreeze tank.  The 
fix for these problems is more involved.

I've been down this road too, Adam.  The best thing to do is fork out 
for real Bosch arms & blades.  The blades can be had for around $8 - 
$11 /pair, and the arms, last I checked, were around $25 (dunno if 
pair/single).  You may be able to get arms from a used parts place.

Don't get the aftermarket "aerodynamic" blades; they're actually worse 
than stock and have MORE lift at speed, and are less effective.  I 
removed a set of these for a friend who bought them based on the sales 
pitch, and tossed them based on engineering.

I think this is a general wet/cold weather thing.  Sunday, drove 110 miles

constant 75.  Oil scum was still there when I got back to Charlotte.

This brings up another question.  After being on the highway for a while,

than 1 bar per 1000 RPMs.  Is this okay, even though it violates the 1
bar/1000 RPM rule?  Or am I heading for trouble (please, I need no more)?

Subject: 914 parts extravaganza

	I was in the process of building a 914 for autox/racing, 
however, the car was damaged too badly in an accident at some time in 
its life (chassis is bent) and I am finding that my Caterham 7 has taken 
all my spare time (I have been doing some mods to it to keep competitive 
in DM SCCA autoxing). So, I have the following parts for sale:

New parts (mostly from Automobile Atlanta:

911 braking kit
shift bushing kit (side shift xmission)
L & R exterior door latch
Front and rear Bistein performance shocks
140# spring set
22 mm adj anti-roll bar
bolt in roll bar
911 turbo tie rod kit
911T front calipers
front and rear carbon kevlar brake pads
minilite replica wheels (15X6)
tan carpet kit


Used parts (from the 914):

Just about anything except engine (which was also a basket case)

I will sell the new parts for 25% below what I paid from Automobile 
Atlanta. I will sell the used parts cheap.

	Please, no smart alec messages about how dumb I was to order all 
the above and then not use them! At least the 7 runs REAL good.

Subject: Re: Help..I screwed Up my pop-off valve installation!!


A small update.

I have determined (been told?) that the "gizmo" that I drilled into
was the cold-start fuel distribution manifold. It only appeared in 
81 (going by memory here...it was around then anyways) onwards. This
is why I did not see one in my neighbours 76S, or most of the people
on the net did not have one who have put in the valve. 

Anyways, the distribution manifold apparently was Porsche's solution
to reduce the amount of fuel in the airbox when the cold-start
(7th injector :-) ) was active. This is why the occurance of blown
air boxes is much less in the late model SC's, even though they 
still use CIS.

The hole is not that bid, and does not go **through** the manifold.
I am attempting an experiment using Locktite Copper gasket sealer
on some test cases. I have found a source for stubby stainless 
sheet metal screws, so I have used one of these in a test piece 
of sheet metal with the Locktite. I have also experimented with 
just using the locktite by it self, filling the hole like a plug.
I am also going to try forming a plug with the locktite, and then
us the locktite to seal that plug in the hole.

**Sigh**. I have used a combination of magnets, shop vac and sticky
tape to clean up all the metal shavings. There really was not that 
many in the box anyways, and it appears to be pretty clean now.
I have very little black plastic shavings in the air box because I
was using the shopvac while drilling the hole. 

The cold-start manifold must be no more than 1/2" below the bottom 
of the drill site...I would have realized that if I would have
read Mr. Anderson's book more carefully..of course you only see
it after the fact!

Anyways, I will keep you posted.

Subject: 911 Hard Start

I would like to solicit your opinion on the starting behavior of my 87 911.
When I cold start it takes 4-6 secs to start, then the idle oscilates
between 900 and 1100 rpm for about 15-20 secs.  If I restart it soon after
the engine is turned off, either hot or cold, it starts right up.
Occasionally, it starts in 1-2 secs when cold, maybe one out of seven times.
I don't think this is normal behavior (maybe the oscilation is) it seems
like it should start right away.  Any ideas?

I got to watch my 911SC get new rear fenders, new rear cross-piece and

That was *NOT* simple do it yourself job. Those fenders are seam welded into

Subject: Sometimes you have to just sit and enjoy...

This past Sunday I was motivated to re-organize the garage -- don't 
know why, but there was something in the air.  After a morning of 
running around shopping for baby wallpaper and gadgets, I was ready 
for a change.

I started off with the left side and was finished within the hour.  I 
went to push the 356 out of the garage and saw "Murphy..." sitting in 
the passenger seat next to "Secrets..." (Earlier in the week I was 
checking if the engine had seen a previous overhaul...).  So I sat 
down, opened to a page at random and started reading.

Two hours later, my wife found me still sitting in the 356, smile on 
my face, the book open in front of me, and the righthand side of the 
garage not even touched.  She laughed and inquired how the Super Joke 
was going -- I had no clue!  I tried to explain, but I don't think she 
understands...:(

There is something about the smell, ambiance, character, or?! of your 
special friends sitting in the garage.  The mixture of leather, oil, 
racing fuel, and rubber serves as an aphrodisiac that some get, some 
don't -- who cares?!  I enjoyed my Sunday afternoon "driving" the 356 
w/o ever leaving my garage!

Thanks for listening, hope you get "it", and have a great week!!

Actually, Scott exposes a very good point here, one that I keep trying to make
every chance I get: just because something is good for racing does not mean
that it's even *USEFUL* for the street.... What you can tolerate in a full
race engine is very different that you want in a street engine. Why? Because
you're going to be tearing that engine down and rebuilding it with pretty
good frequency. At least once a season. Maybe more like every race if you're
talking IMSA or one of the serious pro series. That's just what you do.

So only getting say 10k miles of engine life due to a crappy air filter
is *NO BIG DEAL*... Here's the math: 10,000 miles at an average 100 MPH
is 100 hours of operation which is 3 to 5 times longer than the engine
lives *ANYWAY*!!!! So just because you use K&N on racing engines doesn't
mean *ANYTHING* about how good they are for the street!!!!! On the
other hand, a filter that keeps your engine *PERFECT* (yeah, right) for
100k miles is going to be *WORTHLESS* on a race car, because you will 
be losing some flow efficiency, and you can't afford that. Period.

Yeah, I run the K&Ns on my race car too, and *HIGHLY* recommend the ITG filters
for carb applications when racing...

Street, that's another can of beans entirely... Factory air and oil filters
ONLY (but would highly consider the Canton/Meca oil filter for street use).

Subject: Crankcase Cottage Cheese


Hi all, 

The phenomonom you describe is a form of condensation of oil vapor that
also occurs in 911 dry sump tanks. This occurs because the driving cycle 
is such that the oil does not reach full operating temperature to 
outgas the watervapor that condenses from short cycle driving.

For Mike Weilman and 924 Turbo owners, there is an oil trap 6 inches
from the air cleaner but 18 inches from the block. It almost never gets
hot enough to vaporize the water condensation, the normal purge cycle
of the vapor traps moves this white-ish goo onto the air cleaner element
ruining the element. I have removed the trap and cleaned it.

Pulsing vapor is caused by the pulses of the pistons displacing air in
the crankcase. Dark, oily vapor indicates blow-by, not good. Clear or
whitish vapor is condensation, just getting warmed up to get out of the 
system. Driving on the freeway for an hour or so should get things warm
enough to get rid of the condensation.

go straight,so when the force going side ways is so strong it becomes all
most impossible to to hold the wheel.the wheel will actually snap back to the
straight position!the important part is to stay on the power and remember to
grab back hold of the wheel!. if u lift be sure to get right back on the
power ultimately u want to stay on the power.if u lift and dont get back on

a)  Get off the gas. 
b)  Get on the gas.  
c)  Keep the gas where it is.
d)  Get on the brakes (presumably implying off the gas).
e) Something other than any of the above.

What is the recommended action (both pedals and steering) ?

Howdy Y'all,

Moving to Dayton, OH from San Diego is a weather shock.  Especially for the 
P700Z's on the Turbo.  On the rare occasions that it has been in the 
slippery stuff, I might as well be wearing slicks.

Overall, I've not been happy with the P's.  They require constant balancing, 
and have an extremely harsh ride.

What's the experience and recommendation for a better all around tire for 
Midwest weather and less harshness?

Also, on size, the rear stock size 225's are nice, but I think I could use 
some more meat back there.  What's the current thinking on sizes, sticking 
with the factory 16" wheels.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: Re:   931: Oil in the PCV air  

This problem sounds more related to poor engine oil control than to a turbo
related problem. The oil from the turbo just dumps out into the (top of the)
oil pan and should not go into suspension (hence ending up in the air
filter).  My 931 also shows signs of oil on the filter  - though not to the
same extent that your car does Mike.  Does your car smoke at all?  (maybe on
gear changes or during high boost conditions - maybe needs new rings?)
As an aside, EBS (Engine Builders Supply or something), who advertises in
European car has a high(er) performance rebuild kit available for the 931
with 8.0:1 CR pistons - for $700 which is not too bad - I am not sure what
else is included in this kit though.  I sent for their catalog several months
but have had no response yet.  When I rebuild someday I will consider some
sort of [quality] alternative to the stock bits.  What would a set of stock
931 pistons cost I wonder?

     Before you rush into this, I thought I'd add my 2p worth.  I believe 
the Bosch (=Autobahn at your friendly VW/Porsche/Audi dealer) are the best 
blades I've used and seen.  They are a little expensive but I think they 
hold up well over time.  Besides, new arms couldn't be cheap.  I think the 
way you can replace just the inserts works pretty well.
     If this seems to be my personal opinion and no one out there likes, 
just let me know.  But I've had good luck with the Bosch blades over the 
years.

Subject: 911 sub/wheels/short shift

Sorry that there has been no further info on the 911 salvage for the people 
who asked but I have not been able to followup for the last week.

My 86 Carrera came with pretty chrome/matched paint wheels. Don't know their 
origin but like most of them, the chrome is pitting so badly that they need 
their own maintenance man. Anyone have any suggestions, or a good set of 
alloys (16x7's and 8's) for sale reasonably?

Watched the commentary on the short shift. Anyone have first hand experience 
with installing on this late 915 trans version? What would I expect? Any 
difference between the factory version and say the Automotion version with 
claims it is the easiest to install?

TIA

How easy is it to replace the rear fender on a 911SC?  I know the fronts

Subject: RE: 951 oil scum question

This is moisture trying to escape your oil pan.  It accumulates from 
high humidity levels typically, and is fairly common.  Make sure you 
change the oil frequently to remove this moisture (and other dirt, 
etc.) from the oil.

Sometimes water in the oil is caused by a head gasket or oil/water 
intercooler seal leak.  If this is happening you'll see/smell 
antifreeze in the oil, and maybe oil scum in the antifreeze tank.  The 
fix for these problems is more involved.

Subject: RE: 944 Wiper Arms - preferenes?

I've been down this road too, Adam.  The best thing to do is fork out 
for real Bosch arms & blades.  The blades can be had for around $8 - 
$11 /pair, and the arms, last I checked, were around $25 (dunno if 
pair/single).  You may be able to get arms from a used parts place.

Don't get the aftermarket "aerodynamic" blades; they're actually worse 
than stock and have MORE lift at speed, and are less effective.  I 
removed a set of these for a friend who bought them based on the sales 
pitch, and tossed them based on engineering.

I think this is a general wet/cold weather thing.  Sunday, drove 110 miles
from Charlotte to Columbia between 75-85, got my heart stepped all over
by my girlfriend/potential ex for about 3 hours, then drove back at a
constant 75.  Oil scum was still there when I got back to Charlotte.

This brings up another question.  After being on the highway for a while,
in 5th gear at RPMs, what, near 4000?, I noticed the oil pressure was less
than 1 bar per 1000 RPMs.  Is this okay, even though it violates the 1
bar/1000 RPM rule?  Or am I heading for trouble (please, I need no more)?

        I was in the process of building a 914 for autox/racing, 
however, the car was damaged too badly in an accident at some time in 
its life (chassis is bent) and I am finding that my Caterham 7 has taken 
all my spare time (I have been doing some mods to it to keep competitive 
in DM SCCA autoxing). So, I have the following parts for sale:

New parts (mostly from Automobile Atlanta:

911 braking kit
shift bushing kit (side shift xmission)
L & R exterior door latch
Front and rear Bistein performance shocks
140# spring set
22 mm adj anti-roll bar
bolt in roll bar
911 turbo tie rod kit
911T front calipers
front and rear carbon kevlar brake pads
minilite replica wheels (15X6)
tan carpet kit


Used parts (from the 914):

Just about anything except engine (which was also a basket case)

I will sell the new parts for 25% below what I paid from Automobile 
Atlanta. I will sell the used parts cheap.

        Please, no smart alec messages about how dumb I was to order all 
the above and then not use them! At least the 7 runs REAL good.

Subject: Re: Help..I screwed Up my pop-off valve installation!!


A small update.

I have determined (been told?) that the "gizmo" that I drilled into
was the cold-start fuel distribution manifold. It only appeared in 
81 (going by memory here...it was around then anyways) onwards. This
is why I did not see one in my neighbours 76S, or most of the people
on the net did not have one who have put in the valve. 

Anyways, the distribution manifold apparently was Porsche's solution
to reduce the amount of fuel in the airbox when the cold-start
(7th injector :-) ) was active. This is why the occurance of blown
air boxes is much less in the late model SC's, even though they 
still use CIS.

The hole is not that bid, and does not go **through** the manifold.
I am attempting an experiment using Locktite Copper gasket sealer
on some test cases. I have found a source for stubby stainless 
sheet metal screws, so I have used one of these in a test piece 
of sheet metal with the Locktite. I have also experimented with 
just using the locktite by it self, filling the hole like a plug.
I am also going to try forming a plug with the locktite, and then
us the locktite to seal that plug in the hole.

**Sigh**. I have used a combination of magnets, shop vac and sticky
tape to clean up all the metal shavings. There really was not that 
many in the box anyways, and it appears to be pretty clean now.
I have very little black plastic shavings in the air box because I
was using the shopvac while drilling the hole. 

The cold-start manifold must be no more than 1/2" below the bottom 
of the drill site...I would have realized that if I would have
read Mr. Anderson's book more carefully..of course you only see
it after the fact!

Anyways, I will keep you posted.

Subject: 911 Hard Start

I would like to solicit your opinion on the starting behavior of my 87 911.
When I cold start it takes 4-6 secs to start, then the idle oscilates
between 900 and 1100 rpm for about 15-20 secs.  If I restart it soon after
the engine is turned off, either hot or cold, it starts right up.
Occasionally, it starts in 1-2 secs when cold, maybe one out of seven times.
I don't think this is normal behavior (maybe the oscilation is) it seems
like it should start right away.  Any ideas?

I got to watch my 911SC get new rear fenders, new rear cross-piece and
a significant amount of cut-and-paste done after a woman doctor pushed
a Caddy Eldorado into me at about 45 MPH while I was waiting for a light
to go from red to green....

That was *NOT* simple do it yourself job. Those fenders are seam welded into
place, and replacement is NOT trivial. The guys that did my work were very
very good, and it still took about 3 months to get the car back.

Subject: Sometimes you have to just sit and enjoy...

This past Sunday I was motivated to re-organize the garage -- don't 
know why, but there was something in the air.  After a morning of 
running around shopping for baby wallpaper and gadgets, I was ready 
for a change.

I started off with the left side and was finished within the hour.  I 
went to push the 356 out of the garage and saw "Murphy..." sitting in 
the passenger seat next to "Secrets..." (Earlier in the week I was 
checking if the engine had seen a previous overhaul...).  So I sat 
down, opened to a page at random and started reading.

Two hours later, my wife found me still sitting in the 356, smile on 
my face, the book open in front of me, and the righthand side of the 
garage not even touched.  She laughed and inquired how the Super Joke 
was going -- I had no clue!  I tried to explain, but I don't think she 
understands...:(

There is something about the smell, ambiance, character, or?! of your 
special friends sitting in the garage.  The mixture of leather, oil, 
racing fuel, and rubber serves as an aphrodisiac that some get, some 
don't -- who cares?!  I enjoyed my Sunday afternoon "driving" the 356 
w/o ever leaving my garage!

Thanks for listening, hope you get "it", and have a great week!!

Actually, Scott exposes a very good point here, one that I keep trying to make
every chance I get: just because something is good for racing does not mean
that it's even *USEFUL* for the street.... What you can tolerate in a full
race engine is very different that you want in a street engine. Why? Because
you're going to be tearing that engine down and rebuilding it with pretty
good frequency. At least once a season. Maybe more like every race if you're
talking IMSA or one of the serious pro series. That's just what you do.

So only getting say 10k miles of engine life due to a crappy air filter
is *NO BIG DEAL*... Here's the math: 10,000 miles at an average 100 MPH
is 100 hours of operation which is 3 to 5 times longer than the engine
lives *ANYWAY*!!!! So just because you use K&N on racing engines doesn't
mean *ANYTHING* about how good they are for the street!!!!! On the
other hand, a filter that keeps your engine *PERFECT* (yeah, right) for
100k miles is going to be *WORTHLESS* on a race car, because you will 
be losing some flow efficiency, and you can't afford that. Period.

>  -Scott Jessen -- and why, yes, I have raced a fair bit off road now that you

Yeah, I run the K&Ns on my race car too, and *HIGHLY* recommend the ITG filters
for carb applications when racing...

Street, that's another can of beans entirely... Factory air and oil filters
ONLY (but would highly consider the Canton/Meca oil filter for street use).

        A friend of mine is looking for an early 80's SC or Carrera. In
a snowy cold climate like this we have often wondered when exactly the 
100% galvinized metal was incorporated into the 911.  We have gotten
conflicting information ranging from 1977 to 1984.  I know that it
started with 1980 on the 924, one would think earlier with the 911 -
does anyone have the hard facts?

(the Late) Dean Batchelor said 911's were galvanized starting in '76.  I posted 
this a week or so ago, and Bruce Anderson questioned me on it.  As I told Bruce,
I can't lay my hands on the book to look up the reference. but I remember it
pretty clearly, as that's one of the issues that was important to me when I
was searching for my toy.  Bruce told me that the issue is pretty controversial,
so I infer that the reference may not be correct.

Subject: Crankcase Cottage Cheese


Hi all, 

The phenomonom you describe is a form of condensation of oil vapor that
also occurs in 911 dry sump tanks. This occurs because the driving cycle 
is such that the oil does not reach full operating temperature to 
outgas the watervapor that condenses from short cycle driving.

For Mike Weilman and 924 Turbo owners, there is an oil trap 6 inches
from the air cleaner but 18 inches from the block. It almost never gets
hot enough to vaporize the water condensation, the normal purge cycle
of the vapor traps moves this white-ish goo onto the air cleaner element
ruining the element. I have removed the trap and cleaned it.

Pulsing vapor is caused by the pulses of the pistons displacing air in
the crankcase. Dark, oily vapor indicates blow-by, not good. Clear or
whitish vapor is condensation, just getting warmed up to get out of the 
system. Driving on the freeway for an hour or so should get things warm
enough to get rid of the condensation.

buying.  I have come across a 1972 911 Targa for sale from a gut in Kansas.
It has the "S" package, aftermarket stainless exhaust, small amount of rust
showing in the front end, and about 70,000 mi. on the odo.  Asking price is
about $7,000. 

        My questions are these:

Was '72 a "good" year for the 911T?

With this limited amt. of info, how can I determine the relative value of
this car sight unseen?  (I'm in Seattle, BTW.)

Given these parameters, is it possible to find a good price to offer?

Please feel free to email any advice or tips, warnings, etc.  Thanks in advance!

letting the wheel go can be a life saver,if u posse the skill. i have used
this technique many times at low and high speeds.i dont know where or how i
learned it but i can tell u that it really works.u see cars want to naturally
go straight,so when the force going side ways is so strong it becomes all
most impossible to to hold the wheel.the wheel will actually snap back to the
straight position!the important part is to stay on the power and remember to
grab back hold of the wheel!. if u lift be sure to get right back on the
power ultimately u want to stay on the power.if u lift and dont get back on
the power,round and round u go (just ask russ) P.S.this  also works in
motorcyling.

For the Front:  Jackpoint - Front Cross Support Box Beam

                                        Pads

I originally asked the question and Bruce Anderson responded that _full_

	Try to get Bosch arms if you can. I tried putting cheap wipers on

	Porsches usuallly come with Bosch arms and its worth replacing them 
with the same brand if you can find them.

Subject: 951 Wheels


Does anyone have a set of wheels that they would like to sell for a 1989 944 
Turbo S?  (Aren't all 1989 944 Turbos the "S" model?)

I have a friend with this model car and he wants to get a second set of rims 
at a reasonable price for use in the winter.  He wants to mount snow tires 
on them.  This would allow him to make the occasional weekend trip up to 
Whistler (We live in Vancouver.) without risking life, limb, and sheet 
metal.

The wheels need not be perfect, but they shouldn't be completely unseemly. 
 Scrapes and scratches are okay, but major gouges or truly disgusting levels 
of corrosion probably won't interest him.

Direct all replies to me.  Thanks in advance!

In 1961, with my wife and two kids, we picked up our new 356B Coupe at
Sonauto dealership in Paris. None of us had ever been in a Porsche before
(except to see if the kids fit in the back), much less driven one. We made
two wrong turns and immediately found ourselves in L'Etoile at lunch hour.

Can't remember how many revolutions we made. Went into it as a terrified

What with the recent thread on whether to let go the controls when in
a spin, I was wondering what the expert drivers out there recommend
when you start to lose the tail of your 911 ?

a)  Get off the gas. 
b)  Get on the gas.  
c)  Keep the gas where it is.
d)  Get on the brakes (presumably implying off the gas).
e) Something other than any of the above.

What is the recommended action (both pedals and steering) ?

Subject: TIRES FOR 930


Howdy Y'all,

Moving to Dayton, OH from San Diego is a weather shock.  Especially for the 
P700Z's on the Turbo.  On the rare occasions that it has been in the 
slippery stuff, I might as well be wearing slicks.

Overall, I've not been happy with the P's.  They require constant balancing, 
and have an extremely harsh ride.

What's the experience and recommendation for a better all around tire for 
Midwest weather and less harshness?

Also, on size, the rear stock size 225's are nice, but I think I could use 
some more meat back there.  What's the current thinking on sizes, sticking 
with the factory 16" wheels.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: Re:   931: Oil in the PCV air  

This problem sounds more related to poor engine oil control than to a turbo
related problem. The oil from the turbo just dumps out into the (top of the)
oil pan and should not go into suspension (hence ending up in the air
filter).  My 931 also shows signs of oil on the filter  - though not to the
same extent that your car does Mike.  Does your car smoke at all?  (maybe on
gear changes or during high boost conditions - maybe needs new rings?)
As an aside, EBS (Engine Builders Supply or something), who advertises in
European car has a high(er) performance rebuild kit available for the 931
with 8.0:1 CR pistons - for $700 which is not too bad - I am not sure what
else is included in this kit though.  I sent for their catalog several months
but have had no response yet.  When I rebuild someday I will consider some
sort of [quality] alternative to the stock bits.  What would a set of stock
931 pistons cost I wonder?

     Before you rush into this, I thought I'd add my 2p worth.  I believe 
the Bosch (=Autobahn at your friendly VW/Porsche/Audi dealer) are the best 
blades I've used and seen.  They are a little expensive but I think they 
hold up well over time.  Besides, new arms couldn't be cheap.  I think the 
way you can replace just the inserts works pretty well.
     If this seems to be my personal opinion and no one out there likes, 
just let me know.  But I've had good luck with the Bosch blades over the 
years.

I think they are (usually) a very expensive place to buy parts but
I just purchased (Bosch) replacement blades from Automotion for 
$3.96 each.  That's less than I pay for Anco blades down at the 
autoparts store.  I have a flyer that says they are having a %20 off 
sale on all parts Feb 7 through 10.  944 blades are $4.76 ea. 
There number is 1-800-777-8881

P.S. By blades I mean the metal and the rubber (not just the rubber "blade").

Subject: 911 sub/wheels/short shift

Sorry that there has been no further info on the 911 salvage for the people 
who asked but I have not been able to followup for the last week.

My 86 Carrera came with pretty chrome/matched paint wheels. Don't know their 
origin but like most of them, the chrome is pitting so badly that they need 
their own maintenance man. Anyone have any suggestions, or a good set of 
alloys (16x7's and 8's) for sale reasonably?

Watched the commentary on the short shift. Anyone have first hand experience 
with installing on this late 915 trans version? What would I expect? Any 
difference between the factory version and say the Automotion version with 
claims it is the easiest to install?

TIA

Which makes me finally ask a question I've been stewing over for a while. 
How easy is it to replace the rear fender on a 911SC?  I know the fronts
are more or less a bolt on affair, but what about the back and the
roofline, etc.?

This note, which was forwarded to me days ago by a friend, is pretty much
why I stopped reading rec.autos.tech.  Too many kids with nothing better to
do that make shit up and see if anybody figures it out. Suurre, oil
impregnated filters pass more dirt, uh huh. That's why every dirt racer just
about in existence runs one of these or a K&N style -- they LIKE to put dirt
thru their motors]  They can win major offroad events this way.  Yeah,

Subject: RE: 951 oil scum question

This is moisture trying to escape your oil pan.  It accumulates from 
high humidity levels typically, and is fairly common.  Make sure you 
change the oil frequently to remove this moisture (and other dirt, 
etc.) from the oil.

Sometimes water in the oil is caused by a head gasket or oil/water 
intercooler seal leak.  If this is happening you'll see/smell 
antifreeze in the oil, and maybe oil scum in the antifreeze tank.  The 
fix for these problems is more involved.

Subject: RE: 944 Wiper Arms - preferenes?

I've been down this road too, Adam.  The best thing to do is fork out 
for real Bosch arms & blades.  The blades can be had for around $8 - 
$11 /pair, and the arms, last I checked, were around $25 (dunno if 
pair/single).  You may be able to get arms from a used parts place.

Don't get the aftermarket "aerodynamic" blades; they're actually worse 
than stock and have MORE lift at speed, and are less effective.  I 
removed a set of these for a friend who bought them based on the sales 
pitch, and tossed them based on engineering.

I think this is a general wet/cold weather thing.  Sunday, drove 110 miles
from Charlotte to Columbia between 75-85, got my heart stepped all over
by my girlfriend/potential ex for about 3 hours, then drove back at a
constant 75.  Oil scum was still there when I got back to Charlotte.

This brings up another question.  After being on the highway for a while,
in 5th gear at RPMs, what, near 4000?, I noticed the oil pressure was less
than 1 bar per 1000 RPMs.  Is this okay, even though it violates the 1
bar/1000 RPM rule?  Or am I heading for trouble (please, I need no more)?

Subject: 914 parts extravaganza

        I was in the process of building a 914 for autox/racing, 
however, the car was damaged too badly in an accident at some time in 
its life (chassis is bent) and I am finding that my Caterham 7 has taken 
all my spare time (I have been doing some mods to it to keep competitive 
in DM SCCA autoxing). So, I have the following parts for sale:

New parts (mostly from Automobile Atlanta:

911 braking kit
shift bushing kit (side shift xmission)
L & R exterior door latch
Front and rear Bistein performance shocks
140# spring set
22 mm adj anti-roll bar
bolt in roll bar
911 turbo tie rod kit
911T front calipers
front and rear carbon kevlar brake pads
minilite replica wheels (15X6)
tan carpet kit


Used parts (from the 914):

Just about anything except engine (which was also a basket case)

I will sell the new parts for 25% below what I paid from Automobile 
Atlanta. I will sell the used parts cheap.

        Please, no smart alec messages about how dumb I was to order all 
the above and then not use them! At least the 7 runs REAL good.

Subject: Re: Help..I screwed Up my pop-off valve installation!!


A small update.

I have determined (been told?) that the "gizmo" that I drilled into
was the cold-start fuel distribution manifold. It only appeared in 
81 (going by memory here...it was around then anyways) onwards. This
is why I did not see one in my neighbours 76S, or most of the people
on the net did not have one who have put in the valve. 

Anyways, the distribution manifold apparently was Porsche's solution
to reduce the amount of fuel in the airbox when the cold-start
(7th injector :-) ) was active. This is why the occurance of blown
air boxes is much less in the late model SC's, even though they 
still use CIS.

The hole is not that bid, and does not go **through** the manifold.
I am attempting an experiment using Locktite Copper gasket sealer
on some test cases. I have found a source for stubby stainless 
sheet metal screws, so I have used one of these in a test piece 
of sheet metal with the Locktite. I have also experimented with 
just using the locktite by it self, filling the hole like a plug.
I am also going to try forming a plug with the locktite, and then
us the locktite to seal that plug in the hole.

**Sigh**. I have used a combination of magnets, shop vac and sticky
tape to clean up all the metal shavings. There really was not that 
many in the box anyways, and it appears to be pretty clean now.
I have very little black plastic shavings in the air box because I
was using the shopvac while drilling the hole. 

The cold-start manifold must be no more than 1/2" below the bottom 
of the drill site...I would have realized that if I would have
read Mr. Anderson's book more carefully..of course you only see
it after the fact!

Anyways, I will keep you posted.

Adam--
I had to replace the wipers on my 89 944 right after I bought it. The 
blades are narrow. I finally found an auto parts store that specialized 
in European cars and got a set that fit. Bosch parts. Last resort, try a 
dealer. There should be acouple in Ann Arbor.

Subject: 911 Hard Start

I would like to solicit your opinion on the starting behavior of my 87 911.
When I cold start it takes 4-6 secs to start, then the idle oscilates
between 900 and 1100 rpm for about 15-20 secs.  If I restart it soon after
the engine is turned off, either hot or cold, it starts right up.
Occasionally, it starts in 1-2 secs when cold, maybe one out of seven times.
I don't think this is normal behavior (maybe the oscilation is) it seems
like it should start right away.  Any ideas?

I got to watch my 911SC get new rear fenders, new rear cross-piece and
a significant amount of cut-and-paste done after a woman doctor pushed
a Caddy Eldorado into me at about 45 MPH while I was waiting for a light
to go from red to green....

That was *NOT* simple do it yourself job. Those fenders are seam welded into
place, and replacement is NOT trivial. The guys that did my work were very
very good, and it still took about 3 months to get the car back.

Subject: Sometimes you have to just sit and enjoy...

This past Sunday I was motivated to re-organize the garage -- don't 
know why, but there was something in the air.  After a morning of 
running around shopping for baby wallpaper and gadgets, I was ready 
for a change.

I started off with the left side and was finished within the hour.  I 
went to push the 356 out of the garage and saw "Murphy..." sitting in 
the passenger seat next to "Secrets..." (Earlier in the week I was 
checking if the engine had seen a previous overhaul...).  So I sat 
down, opened to a page at random and started reading.

Two hours later, my wife found me still sitting in the 356, smile on 
my face, the book open in front of me, and the righthand side of the 
garage not even touched.  She laughed and inquired how the Super Joke 
was going -- I had no clue!  I tried to explain, but I don't think she 
understands...:(

There is something about the smell, ambiance, character, or?! of your 
special friends sitting in the garage.  The mixture of leather, oil, 
racing fuel, and rubber serves as an aphrodisiac that some get, some 
don't -- who cares?!  I enjoyed my Sunday afternoon "driving" the 356 
w/o ever leaving my garage!

Thanks for listening, hope you get "it", and have a great week!!

Actually, Scott exposes a very good point here, one that I keep trying to make
every chance I get: just because something is good for racing does not mean
that it's even *USEFUL* for the street.... What you can tolerate in a full
race engine is very different that you want in a street engine. Why? Because
you're going to be tearing that engine down and rebuilding it with pretty
good frequency. At least once a season. Maybe more like every race if you're
talking IMSA or one of the serious pro series. That's just what you do.

So only getting say 10k miles of engine life due to a crappy air filter
is *NO BIG DEAL*... Here's the math: 10,000 miles at an average 100 MPH
is 100 hours of operation which is 3 to 5 times longer than the engine
lives *ANYWAY*!!!! So just because you use K&N on racing engines doesn't
mean *ANYTHING* about how good they are for the street!!!!! On the
other hand, a filter that keeps your engine *PERFECT* (yeah, right) for
100k miles is going to be *WORTHLESS* on a race car, because you will 
be losing some flow efficiency, and you can't afford that. Period.

>  -Scott Jessen -- and why, yes, I have raced a fair bit off road now that you

Yeah, I run the K&Ns on my race car too, and *HIGHLY* recommend the ITG filters
for carb applications when racing...

Street, that's another can of beans entirely... Factory air and oil filters
ONLY (but would highly consider the Canton/Meca oil filter for street use).

(the Late) Dean Batchelor said 911's were galvanized starting in '76.  I posted 
this a week or so ago, and Bruce Anderson questioned me on it.  As I told Bruce,
I can't lay my hands on the book to look up the reference. but I remember it
pretty clearly, as that's one of the issues that was important to me when I

Subject: Crankcase Cottage Cheese


Hi all, 

The phenomonom you describe is a form of condensation of oil vapor that
also occurs in 911 dry sump tanks. This occurs because the driving cycle 
is such that the oil does not reach full operating temperature to 
outgas the watervapor that condenses from short cycle driving.

For Mike Weilman and 924 Turbo owners, there is an oil trap 6 inches
from the air cleaner but 18 inches from the block. It almost never gets
hot enough to vaporize the water condensation, the normal purge cycle
of the vapor traps moves this white-ish goo onto the air cleaner element
ruining the element. I have removed the trap and cleaned it.

Pulsing vapor is caused by the pulses of the pistons displacing air in
the crankcase. Dark, oily vapor indicates blow-by, not good. Clear or
whitish vapor is condensation, just getting warmed up to get out of the 
system. Driving on the freeway for an hour or so should get things warm
enough to get rid of the condensation.

about $7,000.

Was '72 a "good" year for the 911T?

With this limited amt. of info, how can I determine the relative value of

this technique many times at low and high speeds.i dont know where or how i
learned it but i can tell u that it really works.u see cars want to naturally
go straight,so when the force going side ways is so strong it becomes all
most impossible to to hold the wheel.the wheel will actually snap back to the
straight position!the important part is to stay on the power and remember to
grab back hold of the wheel!. if u lift be sure to get right back on the
power ultimately u want to stay on the power.if u lift and dont get back on
the power,round and round u go (just ask russ) P.S.this  also works in

I originally asked the question and Bruce Anderson responded that _full_

    This "manifold" was on earlier cars than the SC, my original '75 box
    didn't have it but a '77 box did.

     Why not just leave the hole in it ? It sounds like you run much
    more risk ingesting a screw or lump of epoxy then just letting
    the hole stay there.  Unless you find a problem with it, I'd leave
    it. (Screw ingestion is one of the only killers 928s have, in fact
    you can look at the changes in the air-filter box on those cars and
    watch how the factory tried to avoid it).

     Or, take apart the box and remove the manifold entirely. If earlier
    cars didn't have to have it your SC should probably work without
    it.  Don't risk a head and cylinder for this.

         Good luck-Lee

Subject: Oil Scum

Re: oil scum in winter

My '83 SC always has some yellowish oil-water emulsion around the filler
neck in winter, anytime average outside temps are below 45F or so.  More
after short trips, less after long trips, but always there.  Water vapor
is always coming out of the crankcase, and this is the first
cold spot that it hits (on its way to being sucked back into the intake
manifold).

It looks to me like a lot of this crud must drip back down the filler
neck into the oil tank.  This has never seemed optimum to me... but then
I was reading an article in R&T (or some such) in '89 or '90 where the
factory ran a squad of Porsche cars up to the north end of Alaska in
winter... to see how they'd hold up I think.  I remember that at about
40 below the 911 had trouble with *water condensing in the
crankcase vent hose and freezing to a solid plug*... until they got some
heater duct and routed the tailpipe back to blow hot exhaust on the vent
hose... then it was on to Pt. Barrow.  (You Minnesota winter drivers
might want to take note...)

 -Ed
meed@mbari.org

p.s. that same article had a wonderful quote from Porsche's R&D
chief, something to the effect that "your car must have steel in it...
the driver must be able to feel the razor edge".  Does anyone remember
this or have the actual quote?

Adam,

        Try to get Bosch arms if you can. I tried putting cheap wipers on 
my 944 and they just didn't clear the screen properly.

        Porsches usuallly come with Bosch arms and its worth replacing them 
with the same brand if you can find them.

Regards,
Philip

Subject: 951 Wheels


Does anyone have a set of wheels that they would like to sell for a 1989 944 
Turbo S?  (Aren't all 1989 944 Turbos the "S" model?)

I have a friend with this model car and he wants to get a second set of rims 
at a reasonable price for use in the winter.  He wants to mount snow tires 
on them.  This would allow him to make the occasional weekend trip up to 
Whistler (We live in Vancouver.) without risking life, limb, and sheet 
metal.

The wheels need not be perfect, but they shouldn't be completely unseemly. 
 Scrapes and scratches are okay, but major gouges or truly disgusting levels 
of corrosion probably won't interest him.

Direct all replies to me.  Thanks in advance!

In 1961, with my wife and two kids, we picked up our new 356B Coupe at
Sonauto dealership in Paris. None of us had ever been in a Porsche before
(except to see if the kids fit in the back), much less driven one. We made
two wrong turns and immediately found ourselves in L'Etoile at lunch hour.

Can't remember how many revolutions we made. Went into it as a terrified
Porsche novice -- came out of it as a Porsche race driver. At least, I
thought so at the time . . . .

Subject: Tail Happy 911s

What with the recent thread on whether to let go the controls when in
a spin, I was wondering what the expert drivers out there recommend
when you start to lose the tail of your 911 ?

a)  Get off the gas. 
b)  Get on the gas.  
c)  Keep the gas where it is.
d)  Get on the brakes (presumably implying off the gas).
e) Something other than any of the above.

What is the recommended action (both pedals and steering) ?

Subject: TIRES FOR 930


Howdy Y'all,

Moving to Dayton, OH from San Diego is a weather shock.  Especially for the 
P700Z's on the Turbo.  On the rare occasions that it has been in the 
slippery stuff, I might as well be wearing slicks.

Overall, I've not been happy with the P's.  They require constant balancing, 
and have an extremely harsh ride.

What's the experience and recommendation for a better all around tire for 
Midwest weather and less harshness?

Also, on size, the rear stock size 225's are nice, but I think I could use 
some more meat back there.  What's the current thinking on sizes, sticking 
with the factory 16" wheels.

Thanks in advance for your help.

From: Mdch01@aol.com
Subject: Re:   931: Oil in the PCV air  

This problem sounds more related to poor engine oil control than to a turbo
related problem. The oil from the turbo just dumps out into the (top of the)
oil pan and should not go into suspension (hence ending up in the air
filter).  My 931 also shows signs of oil on the filter  - though not to the
same extent that your car does Mike.  Does your car smoke at all?  (maybe on
gear changes or during high boost conditions - maybe needs new rings?)
As an aside, EBS (Engine Builders Supply or something), who advertises in
European car has a high(er) performance rebuild kit available for the 931
with 8.0:1 CR pistons - for $700 which is not too bad - I am not sure what
else is included in this kit though.  I sent for their catalog several months
but have had no response yet.  When I rebuild someday I will consider some
sort of [quality] alternative to the stock bits.  What would a set of stock
931 pistons cost I wonder?

     Before you rush into this, I thought I'd add my 2p worth.  I believe 
the Bosch (=Autobahn at your friendly VW/Porsche/Audi dealer) are the best 
blades I've used and seen.  They are a little expensive but I think they 
hold up well over time.  Besides, new arms couldn't be cheap.  I think the 
way you can replace just the inserts works pretty well.
     If this seems to be my personal opinion and no one out there likes, 
just let me know.  But I've had good luck with the Bosch blades over the 
years.

I think they are (usually) a very expensive place to buy parts but
I just purchased (Bosch) replacement blades from Automotion for 
$3.96 each.  That's less than I pay for Anco blades down at the 
autoparts store.  I have a flyer that says they are having a %20 off 
sale on all parts Feb 7 through 10.  944 blades are $4.76 ea. 
There number is 1-800-777-8881

P.S. By blades I mean the metal and the rubber (not just the rubber "blade").

Subject: 911 sub/wheels/short shift

Sorry that there has been no further info on the 911 salvage for the people 
who asked but I have not been able to followup for the last week.

My 86 Carrera came with pretty chrome/matched paint wheels. Don't know their 
origin but like most of them, the chrome is pitting so badly that they need 
their own maintenance man. Anyone have any suggestions, or a good set of 
alloys (16x7's and 8's) for sale reasonably?

Watched the commentary on the short shift. Anyone have first hand experience 
with installing on this late 915 trans version? What would I expect? Any 
difference between the factory version and say the Automotion version with 
claims it is the easiest to install?

TIA

Which makes me finally ask a question I've been stewing over for a while. 
How easy is it to replace the rear fender on a 911SC?  I know the fronts
are more or less a bolt on affair, but what about the back and the
roofline, etc.?

This note, which was forwarded to me days ago by a friend, is pretty much
why I stopped reading rec.autos.tech.  Too many kids with nothing better to
do that make shit up and see if anybody figures it out. Suurre, oil
impregnated filters pass more dirt, uh huh. That's why every dirt racer just
about in existence runs one of these or a K&N style -- they LIKE to put dirt
thru their motors]  They can win major offroad events this way.  Yeah,
right...  Send me accredited test results and not made up no-name bullshit
and I'll listen....

This is moisture trying to escape your oil pan.  It accumulates from 
high humidity levels typically, and is fairly common.  Make sure you 
change the oil frequently to remove this moisture (and other dirt, 
etc.) from the oil.

Sometimes water in the oil is caused by a head gasket or oil/water 
intercooler seal leak.  If this is happening you'll see/smell 
antifreeze in the oil, and maybe oil scum in the antifreeze tank.  The 
fix for these problems is more involved.

I've been down this road too, Adam.  The best thing to do is fork out 
for real Bosch arms & blades.  The blades can be had for around $8 - 
$11 /pair, and the arms, last I checked, were around $25 (dunno if 
pair/single).  You may be able to get arms from a used parts place.

Don't get the aftermarket "aerodynamic" blades; they're actually worse 
than stock and have MORE lift at speed, and are less effective.  I 
removed a set of these for a friend who bought them based on the sales 
pitch, and tossed them based on engineering.

I think this is a general wet/cold weather thing.  Sunday, drove 110 miles
from Charlotte to Columbia between 75-85, got my heart stepped all over
by my girlfriend/potential ex for about 3 hours, then drove back at a
constant 75.  Oil scum was still there when I got back to Charlotte.

This brings up another question.  After being on the highway for a while,
in 5th gear at RPMs, what, near 4000?, I noticed the oil pressure was less
than 1 bar per 1000 RPMs.  Is this okay, even though it violates the 1
bar/1000 RPM rule?  Or am I heading for trouble (please, I need no more)?

Subject: Re: Help..I screwed Up my pop-off valve installation!!


A small update.

I have determined (been told?) that the "gizmo" that I drilled into
was the cold-start fuel distribution manifold. It only appeared in 
81 (going by memory here...it was around then anyways) onwards. This
is why I did not see one in my neighbours 76S, or most of the people
on the net did not have one who have put in the valve. 

Anyways, the distribution manifold apparently was Porsche's solution
to reduce the amount of fuel in the airbox when the cold-start
(7th injector :-) ) was active. This is why the occurance of blown
air boxes is much less in the late model SC's, even though they 
still use CIS.

The hole is not that bid, and does not go **through** the manifold.
I am attempting an experiment using Locktite Copper gasket sealer
on some test cases. I have found a source for stubby stainless 
sheet metal screws, so I have used one of these in a test piece 
of sheet metal with the Locktite. I have also experimented with 
just using the locktite by it self, filling the hole like a plug.
I am also going to try forming a plug with the locktite, and then
us the locktite to seal that plug in the hole.

**Sigh**. I have used a combination of magnets, shop vac and sticky
tape to clean up all the metal shavings. There really was not that 
many in the box anyways, and it appears to be pretty clean now.
I have very little black plastic shavings in the air box because I
was using the shopvac while drilling the hole. 

The cold-start manifold must be no more than 1/2" below the bottom 
of the drill site...I would have realized that if I would have
read Mr. Anderson's book more carefully..of course you only see
it after the fact!

Anyways, I will keep you posted.

Subject: 911 Hard Start

I would like to solicit your opinion on the starting behavior of my 87 911.
When I cold start it takes 4-6 secs to start, then the idle oscilates
between 900 and 1100 rpm for about 15-20 secs.  If I restart it soon after
the engine is turned off, either hot or cold, it starts right up.
Occasionally, it starts in 1-2 secs when cold, maybe one out of seven times.
I don't think this is normal behavior (maybe the oscilation is) it seems
like it should start right away.  Any ideas?

I got to watch my 911SC get new rear fenders, new rear cross-piece and

That was *NOT* simple do it yourself job. Those fenders are seam welded into

This past Sunday I was motivated to re-organize the garage -- don't 
know why, but there was something in the air.  After a morning of 
running around shopping for baby wallpaper and gadgets, I was ready 
for a change.

I started off with the left side and was finished within the hour.  I 
went to push the 356 out of the garage and saw "Murphy..." sitting in 
the passenger seat next to "Secrets..." (Earlier in the week I was 
checking if the engine had seen a previous overhaul...).  So I sat 
down, opened to a page at random and started reading.

Two hours later, my wife found me still sitting in the 356, smile on 
my face, the book open in front of me, and the righthand side of the 
garage not even touched.  She laughed and inquired how the Super Joke 
was going -- I had no clue!  I tried to explain, but I don't think she 
understands...:(

There is something about the smell, ambiance, character, or?! of your 
special friends sitting in the garage.  The mixture of leather, oil, 
racing fuel, and rubber serves as an aphrodisiac that some get, some 
don't -- who cares?!  I enjoyed my Sunday afternoon "driving" the 356

Actually, Scott exposes a very good point here, one that I keep trying to make
every chance I get: just because something is good for racing does not mean
that it's even *USEFUL* for the street.... What you can tolerate in a full
race engine is very different that you want in a street engine. Why? Because
you're going to be tearing that engine down and rebuilding it with pretty
good frequency. At least once a season. Maybe more like every race if you're
talking IMSA or one of the serious pro series. That's just what you do.

So only getting say 10k miles of engine life due to a crappy air filter
is *NO BIG DEAL*... Here's the math: 10,000 miles at an average 100 MPH
is 100 hours of operation which is 3 to 5 times longer than the engine
lives *ANYWAY*!!!! So just because you use K&N on racing engines doesn't
mean *ANYTHING* about how good they are for the street!!!!! On the
other hand, a filter that keeps your engine *PERFECT* (yeah, right) for
100k miles is going to be *WORTHLESS* on a race car, because you will 
be losing some flow efficiency, and you can't afford that. Period.

Yeah, I run the K&Ns on my race car too, and *HIGHLY* recommend the ITG filters
for carb applications when racing...

Street, that's another can of beans entirely... Factory air and oil filters
ONLY (but would highly consider the Canton/Meca oil filter for street use).

(the Late) Dean Batchelor said 911's were galvanized starting in '76.  I posted 
this a week or so ago, and Bruce Anderson questioned me on it.  As I told Bruce,
I can't lay my hands on the book to look up the reference. but I remember it
pretty clearly, as that's one of the issues that was important to me when I
was searching for my toy.  Bruce told me that the issue is pretty controversial,
so I infer that the reference may not be correct.

Subject: Crankcase Cottage Cheese


Hi all, 

The phenomonom you describe is a form of condensation of oil vapor that
also occurs in 911 dry sump tanks. This occurs because the driving cycle 
is such that the oil does not reach full operating temperature to 
outgas the watervapor that condenses from short cycle driving.

For Mike Weilman and 924 Turbo owners, there is an oil trap 6 inches
from the air cleaner but 18 inches from the block. It almost never gets
hot enough to vaporize the water condensation, the normal purge cycle
of the vapor traps moves this white-ish goo onto the air cleaner element
ruining the element. I have removed the trap and cleaned it.

Pulsing vapor is caused by the pulses of the pistons displacing air in
the crankcase. Dark, oily vapor indicates blow-by, not good. Clear or
whitish vapor is condensation, just getting warmed up to get out of the 
system. Driving on the freeway for an hour or so should get things warm
enough to get rid of the condensation.

go straight,so when the force going side ways is so strong it becomes all
most impossible to to hold the wheel.the wheel will actually snap back to the
straight position!the important part is to stay on the power and remember to
grab back hold of the wheel!. if u lift be sure to get right back on the

I originally asked the question and Bruce Anderson responded that _full_ 
galvinization started in '78 on the 911. Bart responded that _partial_ 
galvinization started in '75 with the '76 model year.

Subject: 944 Whine at Speed


I have a freind who is experiencing a whine from his '88 944 turbo S.  He 
claims 
it happens at speed but only whne the out side temp is 15 F or colder.  I have 
heard this whine when he drove by slowly and I do not think it is tire whine 
thought the car is currently equiped with Pirelli snow tires.  Any clues ?

Date: Tue, 31 Jan 95 12:56:16 PST
From: pasha@hal.com (James Pasha)
Subject: 913 924 Turbo Static Compression


Mike, 

The 1979-80 924 Turbo (US only) has a static compression of 7.5:1. the
1981-82 924 Turbo (US only) has a static compression of 8.0:1. It is
highly recommended that any 1979-80 that needs piston replacement use
the 1981-82 piston, size fitted per bore needed.

FYI, all Euro 924 Turbos and 924 Turbo Carreras use 8.5:1 static 
compression, with a different boost profile in the wastegate. These 
pistons work well, remember that the real compression goes to about
11.5:1 under full boost. There is no knock sensor, so be careful.

=======================================================================

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

=======================================================================

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

=======================================================================

Who is the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          Principal, 
          Technology Tranfer Associates
          P.O. Box 2087
          Bellaire TX 77402-2087

     (He got tired of living in Houston, TX and working in Edison, NJ,
so moved back...)

          Houston: e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
                   voice:  (713) 661-2084 

     His Porsches currently include:  
          '64 356 SC (daily driver)
          '74 914 2.0 (SCCA ITA/PCA Club Racing)

=======================================================================

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

=======================================================================

Are there any suggestions on how I should submit to the list?

     Beyond using normal good sense and discretion, you can submit
whatever you like that is relevant to Porsches.  You might want to use
descriptive "Subject" lines, including the model number when it is
relevant (e.g., "944 S2 Fuel leak query").  Your submissions would be 
easier for others to read if you make sure that your mailer wraps 
lines of text at 80 characters or less.

=======================================================================

How do I submit administrative requests?

     Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  

=======================================================================

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/archives.
Archives in six subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95) each of which 
has the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan
may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to mail you
archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY
mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program,
or equivalent, to restore to textual format.  Mac and Windows versions
of "uncompress" are available via FTP from /pub/porschephiles/programs.


=======================================================================

What else is available in the tta.com archives?

     FAQs: In the FAQs directory there is this FAQ and there are FAQs 
for specific Porsche models (so far there's one for 914s and one for 
the Carrera models -- feel free to contribute one on YOUR favorite 
Porsche).  These are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/FAQs.
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.

     PCA racing info: The PCA Club Racing Newsletter is now on-line,
thanks to the tireless efforts of the editor.  This is available by FTP 
in the directory tta.com:/pub/porschephiles/PCA/ClubRacing.  The 
newsletters are available both in PostScript and in Windows Write 
format.  If this is useful to you, send your thanks to the editor, Tom,
at "tt911@ibm.net".
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

=======================================================================
 
Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/Porschephiles/home.html.
The FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

=======================================================================

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions?  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts..."

     In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split.

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state/country of residence, their car's year and model, and
their net address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the
information, and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out
on a monthly basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't
send your Alfa Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send
submissions or changes to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

=======================================================================

I want to join the Porsche Club of America; what do I have to do?

     The Club affiliates you with a local region based on where your
ZIP code falls on their territory map.  You *CAN* request to join a
specific region, and you can specify an affilate region or dual
membership in another region.  The local regions put on many different
events, some social, some educational, some driving or compeition
oriented.  The annual gathering of the whole membership, the Porsche
Parade, features competition for the national championships in many
events, seminars, a GREAT goodie store, and one of the most fun weeks
you'll experience.

     To join, you need to have a Porsche VIN number and be able to claim 
you're an owner, a co-owner, or hold a lease on a Porsche.  That may
seem restrictive, particularly if you want to join the club to get
access to Panorama, the club magazine, for purposes of FINDING a car...
In such case, it's suggested that you purchase a modest fraction of a
friend's car for say $5 or so, hence becoming a co-owner.  Just don't
tell them you did that or where you got the idea...

     Once you have a VIN number, there are four ways to join:

     1) Send a letter to the national office saying that you want to 
join, with your name, address, car info and a check for $36 to:

	Porsche Club of Americia.
	P.O. Box 10402
	Alexandria VA 22310

     2) Call them up at +1 703 922-9300, roughly between 9:00 to 5:00
EST (GMT - 6).  If you have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number
handy, you can do it over the phone.  (Otherwise, they'll send you an
application which you can mail in with your check.)  This is the FASTEST
way, and if you need to be a member *RIGHT NOW* to go to an event that
is members only, this is your best bet.  Don't count on using this
method the week of or before Parade...

     3) find someone active in your local region.  *MANY* of the regions
are represented on the Porschephiles list, so that's a good place to
start.  Once you have found someone, get them to put you in touch with
the local region membership chair, they can give you the form, and off 
you go.

     4) National membership chair Nann Weissenberger is also on the
list, and is reachable via e-mail at "nannw@aol.com".  She'd be more 
than happy to help you out.

=======================================================================

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     If you own a North American Porsche, Porsche Cars North America 
will, for a fee of $20, research the original bill of sale for your car
and give you a Certificate of Authenticity stating the facts and 
figures for the car as it was delivered to the dealer.  If you're 
interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  A similar service is
available in Great Britain from Porsche Cars Great Britain, for about
30 pounds Sterling.  Porsche AG can also perform a similar search.

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

=======================================================================

What are the model numbers of cars related to the Porsche name?

     The following list was extracted from _Illustrated_Porsche_Buyers_

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

Should I use an oil additive in my Porsche engine?

     This is Stan's response:  "Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil.  Or as Bruce 
Anderson commented about something else, "a cash flow device."  Slick-50
is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case.  Guess what we 
all have, eh?  There is a bit of info on it via anonymous FTP in tta.com
in /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo.  Additionally, many of these additives 
use teflon.  DuPont (the inventors of Teflon) have stated categorically 
that teflon is useless in such applications."
 
=======================================================================

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other renowned Porsche people) here?
 
Yes. There are many luminaries in the Porsche world on this list.  If
something is relevant to them, they'll typically respond to you
privately.  Their participation is greatly valued, so respect their
privacy and don't try to draw them out in the open.  If they want to 
say something to the list as a whole, they'll do so.

=======================================================================

Where can I get a copy of the latest version of this FAQ?

     The FAQ is stored on tta.com in the /pub/porschephiles/FAQs 
directory, filename general-FAQ.  The version stored there will be 
the same one sent out monthly.  (There's also a FAQ that's specific to
the 914; other specific FAQs are welcomed, if anyone wants to contribute
to the archives.)

=======================================================================

Who maintains this FAQ?

     The FAQ is maintained by Walt Thode (thode@nprdc.navy.mil).  I have
a 1972 911T as my daily driver.  Anyone who wants to contribute can do
so.  Contributions, revisions, and suggestions for new items are always
welcomed.  I peruse the list for potential additions, but don't be shy 
about sending suggestions directly to me.

Subject: Plated Alloy Cylinders

The discussion on "Ceramichrone" reminded me that we have a jig
for plating 356 cylinders, a jig made up by Richie Lukes.  Richie
either used it or planned to use it to replate alloy cylinders
like super90's etc, and if I remember right he had chrome in
mind.  It sounds like from the discussion there may be
someone in the airplane technology business that actually has
access to such a process.  Or is there still "sprayed iron"
technology out there somewhere?  The 356 group here in the
SF Bay area would like to know about any leads in that
direction; as I said we have Richie's jig and certainly lots
of old  alloy cylinders needing new inner surfaces.

First of all, is this an "S" targa or a "T" targa that's been modified? 
 What do you mean when you say "S" package?  All of the standard S items 
were available as options on the T and E.  For example, my 73 T targa has S 
gauges and trim, but not the brakes.

    This "manifold" was on earlier cars than the SC, my original '75 box
    didn't have it but a '77 box did.

     Why not just leave the hole in it ? It sounds like you run much
    more risk ingesting a screw or lump of epoxy then just letting
    the hole stay there.  Unless you find a problem with it, I'd leave
    it. (Screw ingestion is one of the only killers 928s have, in fact
    you can look at the changes in the air-filter box on those cars and
    watch how the factory tried to avoid it).

     Or, take apart the box and remove the manifold entirely. If earlier
    cars didn't have to have it your SC should probably work without
    it.  Don't risk a head and cylinder for this.

         Good luck-Lee

From: Ed Mellinger <meed@mbari.org>
Subject: Oil Scum

Re: oil scum in winter

My '83 SC always has some yellowish oil-water emulsion around the filler
neck in winter, anytime average outside temps are below 45F or so.  More
after short trips, less after long trips, but always there.  Water vapor
is always coming out of the crankcase, and this is the first
cold spot that it hits (on its way to being sucked back into the intake
manifold).

It looks to me like a lot of this crud must drip back down the filler
neck into the oil tank.  This has never seemed optimum to me... but then
I was reading an article in R&T (or some such) in '89 or '90 where the
factory ran a squad of Porsche cars up to the north end of Alaska in
winter... to see how they'd hold up I think.  I remember that at about
40 below the 911 had trouble with *water condensing in the
crankcase vent hose and freezing to a solid plug*... until they got some
heater duct and routed the tailpipe back to blow hot exhaust on the vent
hose... then it was on to Pt. Barrow.  (You Minnesota winter drivers
might want to take note...)

 -Ed
meed@mbari.org

p.s. that same article had a wonderful quote from Porsche's R&D
chief, something to the effect that "your car must have steel in it...
the driver must be able to feel the razor edge".  Does anyone remember
this or have the actual quote?

Adam,

        Try to get Bosch arms if you can. I tried putting cheap wipers on 
my 944 and they just didn't clear the screen properly.

        Porsches usuallly come with Bosch arms and its worth replacing them 
with the same brand if you can find them.

Philip

Subject: 951 Wheels


Does anyone have a set of wheels that they would like to sell for a 1989 944 
Turbo S?  (Aren't all 1989 944 Turbos the "S" model?)

I have a friend with this model car and he wants to get a second set of rims 
at a reasonable price for use in the winter.  He wants to mount snow tires 
on them.  This would allow him to make the occasional weekend trip up to 
Whistler (We live in Vancouver.) without risking life, limb, and sheet 
metal.

The wheels need not be perfect, but they shouldn't be completely unseemly. 
 Scrapes and scratches are okay, but major gouges or truly disgusting levels 
of corrosion probably won't interest him.

Direct all replies to me.  Thanks in advance!

In 1961, with my wife and two kids, we picked up our new 356B Coupe at
Sonauto dealership in Paris. None of us had ever been in a Porsche before
(except to see if the kids fit in the back), much less driven one. We made
two wrong turns and immediately found ourselves in L'Etoile at lunch hour.

Can't remember how many revolutions we made. Went into it as a terrified
Porsche novice -- came out of it as a Porsche race driver. At least, I
thought so at the time . . . .

Subject: Tail Happy 911s

What with the recent thread on whether to let go the controls when in
a spin, I was wondering what the expert drivers out there recommend
when you start to lose the tail of your 911 ?

a)  Get off the gas. 
b)  Get on the gas.  
c)  Keep the gas where it is.
d)  Get on the brakes (presumably implying off the gas).
e) Something other than any of the above.

What is the recommended action (both pedals and steering) ?

Subject: TIRES FOR 930


Howdy Y'all,

Moving to Dayton, OH from San Diego is a weather shock.  Especially for the 
P700Z's on the Turbo.  On the rare occasions that it has been in the 
slippery stuff, I might as well be wearing slicks.

Overall, I've not been happy with the P's.  They require constant balancing, 
and have an extremely harsh ride.

What's the experience and recommendation for a better all around tire for 
Midwest weather and less harshness?

Also, on size, the rear stock size 225's are nice, but I think I could use 
some more meat back there.  What's the current thinking on sizes, sticking 
with the factory 16" wheels.

Thanks in advance for your help.

From: Mdch01@aol.com
Subject: Re:   931: Oil in the PCV air  

This problem sounds more related to poor engine oil control than to a turbo
related problem. The oil from the turbo just dumps out into the (top of the)
oil pan and should not go into suspension (hence ending up in the air
filter).  My 931 also shows signs of oil on the filter  - though not to the
same extent that your car does Mike.  Does your car smoke at all?  (maybe on
gear changes or during high boost conditions - maybe needs new rings?)
As an aside, EBS (Engine Builders Supply or something), who advertises in
European car has a high(er) performance rebuild kit available for the 931
with 8.0:1 CR pistons - for $700 which is not too bad - I am not sure what
else is included in this kit though.  I sent for their catalog several months
but have had no response yet.  When I rebuild someday I will consider some
sort of [quality] alternative to the stock bits.  What would a set of stock
931 pistons cost I wonder?

     Before you rush into this, I thought I'd add my 2p worth.  I believe 
the Bosch (=Autobahn at your friendly VW/Porsche/Audi dealer) are the best 
blades I've used and seen.  They are a little expensive but I think they 
hold up well over time.  Besides, new arms couldn't be cheap.  I think the 
way you can replace just the inserts works pretty well.
     If this seems to be my personal opinion and no one out there likes, 
just let me know.  But I've had good luck with the Bosch blades over the 
years.

I think they are (usually) a very expensive place to buy parts but
I just purchased (Bosch) replacement blades from Automotion for 
$3.96 each.  That's less than I pay for Anco blades down at the 
autoparts store.  I have a flyer that says they are having a %20 off 
sale on all parts Feb 7 through 10.  944 blades are $4.76 ea. 
There number is 1-800-777-8881

P.S. By blades I mean the metal and the rubber (not just the rubber "blade").

Subject: 911 sub/wheels/short shift

Sorry that there has been no further info on the 911 salvage for the people 
who asked but I have not been able to followup for the last week.

My 86 Carrera came with pretty chrome/matched paint wheels. Don't know their 
origin but like most of them, the chrome is pitting so badly that they need 
their own maintenance man. Anyone have any suggestions, or a good set of 
alloys (16x7's and 8's) for sale reasonably?

Watched the commentary on the short shift. Anyone have first hand experience 
with installing on this late 915 trans version? What would I expect? Any 
difference between the factory version and say the Automotion version with 
claims it is the easiest to install?

TIA

Which makes me finally ask a question I've been stewing over for a while. 
How easy is it to replace the rear fender on a 911SC?  I know the fronts
are more or less a bolt on affair, but what about the back and the
roofline, etc.?

This note, which was forwarded to me days ago by a friend, is pretty much
why I stopped reading rec.autos.tech.  Too many kids with nothing better to
do that make shit up and see if anybody figures it out. Suurre, oil
impregnated filters pass more dirt, uh huh. That's why every dirt racer just
about in existence runs one of these or a K&N style -- they LIKE to put dirt
thru their motors]  They can win major offroad events this way.  Yeah,
right...  Send me accredited test results and not made up no-name bullshit
and I'll listen....

Subject: RE: 951 oil scum question

This is moisture trying to escape your oil pan.  It accumulates from 
high humidity levels typically, and is fairly common.  Make sure you 
change the oil frequently to remove this moisture (and other dirt, 
etc.) from the oil.

Sometimes water in the oil is caused by a head gasket or oil/water 
intercooler seal leak.  If this is happening you'll see/smell 
antifreeze in the oil, and maybe oil scum in the antifreeze tank.  The 
fix for these problems is more involved.

I've been down this road too, Adam.  The best thing to do is fork out 
for real Bosch arms & blades.  The blades can be had for around $8 - 
$11 /pair, and the arms, last I checked, were around $25 (dunno if 
pair/single).  You may be able to get arms from a used parts place.

Don't get the aftermarket "aerodynamic" blades; they're actually worse 
than stock and have MORE lift at speed, and are less effective.  I 
removed a set of these for a friend who bought them based on the sales 
pitch, and tossed them based on engineering.

I think this is a general wet/cold weather thing.  Sunday, drove 110 miles
from Charlotte to Columbia between 75-85, got my heart stepped all over
by my girlfriend/potential ex for about 3 hours, then drove back at a
constant 75.  Oil scum was still there when I got back to Charlotte.

This brings up another question.  After being on the highway for a while,
in 5th gear at RPMs, what, near 4000?, I noticed the oil pressure was less
than 1 bar per 1000 RPMs.  Is this okay, even though it violates the 1
bar/1000 RPM rule?  Or am I heading for trouble (please, I need no more)?

        I was in the process of building a 914 for autox/racing, 
however, the car was damaged too badly in an accident at some time in 
its life (chassis is bent) and I am finding that my Caterham 7 has taken 
all my spare time (I have been doing some mods to it to keep competitive 
in DM SCCA autoxing). So, I have the following parts for sale:

New parts (mostly from Automobile Atlanta:

911 braking kit
shift bushing kit (side shift xmission)
L & R exterior door latch
Front and rear Bistein performance shocks
140# spring set
22 mm adj anti-roll bar
bolt in roll bar
911 turbo tie rod kit
911T front calipers
front and rear carbon kevlar brake pads
minilite replica wheels (15X6)
tan carpet kit


Used parts (from the 914):

Just about anything except engine (which was also a basket case)

I will sell the new parts for 25% below what I paid from Automobile 
Atlanta. I will sell the used parts cheap.

        Please, no smart alec messages about how dumb I was to order all 
the above and then not use them! At least the 7 runs REAL good.

Subject: Re: Help..I screwed Up my pop-off valve installation!!


A small update.

I have determined (been told?) that the "gizmo" that I drilled into
was the cold-start fuel distribution manifold. It only appeared in 
81 (going by memory here...it was around then anyways) onwards. This
is why I did not see one in my neighbours 76S, or most of the people
on the net did not have one who have put in the valve. 

Anyways, the distribution manifold apparently was Porsche's solution
to reduce the amount of fuel in the airbox when the cold-start
(7th injector :-) ) was active. This is why the occurance of blown
air boxes is much less in the late model SC's, even though they 
still use CIS.

The hole is not that bid, and does not go **through** the manifold.
I am attempting an experiment using Locktite Copper gasket sealer
on some test cases. I have found a source for stubby stainless 
sheet metal screws, so I have used one of these in a test piece 
of sheet metal with the Locktite. I have also experimented with 
just using the locktite by it self, filling the hole like a plug.
I am also going to try forming a plug with the locktite, and then
us the locktite to seal that plug in the hole.

**Sigh**. I have used a combination of magnets, shop vac and sticky
tape to clean up all the metal shavings. There really was not that 
many in the box anyways, and it appears to be pretty clean now.
I have very little black plastic shavings in the air box because I
was using the shopvac while drilling the hole. 

The cold-start manifold must be no more than 1/2" below the bottom 
of the drill site...I would have realized that if I would have
read Mr. Anderson's book more carefully..of course you only see
it after the fact!

Anyways, I will keep you posted.

Subject: 911 Hard Start

I would like to solicit your opinion on the starting behavior of my 87 911.
When I cold start it takes 4-6 secs to start, then the idle oscilates
between 900 and 1100 rpm for about 15-20 secs.  If I restart it soon after
the engine is turned off, either hot or cold, it starts right up.
Occasionally, it starts in 1-2 secs when cold, maybe one out of seven times.
I don't think this is normal behavior (maybe the oscilation is) it seems
like it should start right away.  Any ideas?

I got to watch my 911SC get new rear fenders, new rear cross-piece and

That was *NOT* simple do it yourself job. Those fenders are seam welded into

Subject: Sometimes you have to just sit and enjoy...

This past Sunday I was motivated to re-organize the garage -- don't 
know why, but there was something in the air.  After a morning of 
running around shopping for baby wallpaper and gadgets, I was ready 
for a change.

I started off with the left side and was finished within the hour.  I 
went to push the 356 out of the garage and saw "Murphy..." sitting in 
the passenger seat next to "Secrets..." (Earlier in the week I was 
checking if the engine had seen a previous overhaul...).  So I sat 
down, opened to a page at random and started reading.

Two hours later, my wife found me still sitting in the 356, smile on 
my face, the book open in front of me, and the righthand side of the 
garage not even touched.  She laughed and inquired how the Super Joke 
was going -- I had no clue!  I tried to explain, but I don't think she 
understands...:(

There is something about the smell, ambiance, character, or?! of your 
special friends sitting in the garage.  The mixture of leather, oil, 
racing fuel, and rubber serves as an aphrodisiac that some get, some 
don't -- who cares?!  I enjoyed my Sunday afternoon "driving" the 356 
w/o ever leaving my garage!

Actually, Scott exposes a very good point here, one that I keep trying to make
every chance I get: just because something is good for racing does not mean
that it's even *USEFUL* for the street.... What you can tolerate in a full
race engine is very different that you want in a street engine. Why? Because
you're going to be tearing that engine down and rebuilding it with pretty
good frequency. At least once a season. Maybe more like every race if you're
talking IMSA or one of the serious pro series. That's just what you do.

So only getting say 10k miles of engine life due to a crappy air filter
is *NO BIG DEAL*... Here's the math: 10,000 miles at an average 100 MPH
is 100 hours of operation which is 3 to 5 times longer than the engine
lives *ANYWAY*!!!! So just because you use K&N on racing engines doesn't
mean *ANYTHING* about how good they are for the street!!!!! On the
other hand, a filter that keeps your engine *PERFECT* (yeah, right) for
100k miles is going to be *WORTHLESS* on a race car, because you will 
be losing some flow efficiency, and you can't afford that. Period.

>  -Scott Jessen -- and why, yes, I have raced a fair bit off road now that you

Yeah, I run the K&Ns on my race car too, and *HIGHLY* recommend the ITG filters
for carb applications when racing...

Street, that's another can of beans entirely... Factory air and oil filters
ONLY (but would highly consider the Canton/Meca oil filter for street use).

Subject: Crankcase Cottage Cheese


Hi all, 

The phenomonom you describe is a form of condensation of oil vapor that
also occurs in 911 dry sump tanks. This occurs because the driving cycle 
is such that the oil does not reach full operating temperature to 
outgas the watervapor that condenses from short cycle driving.

For Mike Weilman and 924 Turbo owners, there is an oil trap 6 inches
from the air cleaner but 18 inches from the block. It almost never gets
hot enough to vaporize the water condensation, the normal purge cycle
of the vapor traps moves this white-ish goo onto the air cleaner element
ruining the element. I have removed the trap and cleaned it.

Pulsing vapor is caused by the pulses of the pistons displacing air in
the crankcase. Dark, oily vapor indicates blow-by, not good. Clear or
whitish vapor is condensation, just getting warmed up to get out of the 
system. Driving on the freeway for an hour or so should get things warm
enough to get rid of the condensation.

this technique many times at low and high speeds.i dont know where or how i
learned it but i can tell u that it really works.u see cars want to naturally
go straight,so when the force going side ways is so strong it becomes all
most impossible to to hold the wheel.the wheel will actually snap back to the
straight position!the important part is to stay on the power and remember to
grab back hold of the wheel!. if u lift be sure to get right back on the
power ultimately u want to stay on the power.if u lift and dont get back on
the power,round and round u go (just ask russ) P.S.this  also works in

Subject: 913 924 Turbo Static Compression


Mike, 

The 1979-80 924 Turbo (US only) has a static compression of 7.5:1. the
1981-82 924 Turbo (US only) has a static compression of 8.0:1. It is
highly recommended that any 1979-80 that needs piston replacement use
the 1981-82 piston, size fitted per bore needed.

FYI, all Euro 924 Turbos and 924 Turbo Carreras use 8.5:1 static 
compression, with a different boost profile in the wastegate. These 
pistons work well, remember that the real compression goes to about
11.5:1 under full boost. There is no knock sensor, so be careful.

=======================================================================

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

=======================================================================

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

=======================================================================

Who is the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          Principal, 
          Technology Tranfer Associates
          P.O. Box 2087
          Bellaire TX 77402-2087

     (He got tired of living in Houston, TX and working in Edison, NJ,
so moved back...)

          Houston: e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
                   voice:  (713) 661-2084 

     His Porsches currently include:  
          '64 356 SC (daily driver)
          '74 914 2.0 (SCCA ITA/PCA Club Racing)

=======================================================================

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

=======================================================================

Are there any suggestions on how I should submit to the list?

     Beyond using normal good sense and discretion, you can submit
whatever you like that is relevant to Porsches.  You might want to use
descriptive "Subject" lines, including the model number when it is
relevant (e.g., "944 S2 Fuel leak query").  Your submissions would be 
easier for others to read if you make sure that your mailer wraps 
lines of text at 80 characters or less.

=======================================================================

How do I submit administrative requests?

     Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  

=======================================================================

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/archives.
Archives in six subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95) each of which 
has the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan
may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to mail you
archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY
mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program,
or equivalent, to restore to textual format.  Mac and Windows versions
of "uncompress" are available via FTP from /pub/porschephiles/programs.


=======================================================================

What else is available in the tta.com archives?

     FAQs: In the FAQs directory there is this FAQ and there are FAQs 
for specific Porsche models (so far there's one for 914s and one for 
the Carrera models -- feel free to contribute one on YOUR favorite 
Porsche).  These are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/FAQs.
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.

     PCA racing info: The PCA Club Racing Newsletter is now on-line,
thanks to the tireless efforts of the editor.  This is available by FTP 
in the directory tta.com:/pub/porschephiles/PCA/ClubRacing.  The 
newsletters are available both in PostScript and in Windows Write 
format.  If this is useful to you, send your thanks to the editor, Tom,
at "tt911@ibm.net".
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

=======================================================================
 
Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/Porschephiles/home.html.
The FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

=======================================================================

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions?  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts..."

     In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split.

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state/country of residence, their car's year and model, and
their net address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the
information, and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out
on a monthly basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't
send your Alfa Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send
submissions or changes to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

=======================================================================

I want to join the Porsche Club of America; what do I have to do?

     The Club affiliates you with a local region based on where your
ZIP code falls on their territory map.  You *CAN* request to join a
specific region, and you can specify an affilate region or dual
membership in another region.  The local regions put on many different
events, some social, some educational, some driving or compeition
oriented.  The annual gathering of the whole membership, the Porsche
Parade, features competition for the national championships in many
events, seminars, a GREAT goodie store, and one of the most fun weeks
you'll experience.

     To join, you need to have a Porsche VIN number and be able to claim 
you're an owner, a co-owner, or hold a lease on a Porsche.  That may
seem restrictive, particularly if you want to join the club to get
access to Panorama, the club magazine, for purposes of FINDING a car...
In such case, it's suggested that you purchase a modest fraction of a
friend's car for say $5 or so, hence becoming a co-owner.  Just don't
tell them you did that or where you got the idea...

     Once you have a VIN number, there are four ways to join:

     1) Send a letter to the national office saying that you want to 
join, with your name, address, car info and a check for $36 to:

        Porsche Club of Americia.
        P.O. Box 10402
        Alexandria VA 22310

     2) Call them up at +1 703 922-9300, roughly between 9:00 to 5:00
EST (GMT - 6).  If you have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number
handy, you can do it over the phone.  (Otherwise, they'll send you an
application which you can mail in with your check.)  This is the FASTEST
way, and if you need to be a member *RIGHT NOW* to go to an event that
is members only, this is your best bet.  Don't count on using this
method the week of or before Parade...

     3) find someone active in your local region.  *MANY* of the regions
are represented on the Porschephiles list, so that's a good place to
start.  Once you have found someone, get them to put you in touch with
the local region membership chair, they can give you the form, and off 
you go.

     4) National membership chair Nann Weissenberger is also on the
list, and is reachable via e-mail at "nannw@aol.com".  She'd be more 
than happy to help you out.

=======================================================================

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     If you own a North American Porsche, Porsche Cars North America 
will, for a fee of $20, research the original bill of sale for your car
and give you a Certificate of Authenticity stating the facts and 
figures for the car as it was delivered to the dealer.  If you're 
interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  A similar service is
available in Great Britain from Porsche Cars Great Britain, for about
30 pounds Sterling.  Porsche AG can also perform a similar search.

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

=======================================================================

What are the model numbers of cars related to the Porsche name?

     The following list was extracted from _Illustrated_Porsche_Buyers_

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:
Information about water-cooled cars is lacking; those with favorites
should submit them to one of the names at the end of this FAQ.)

Haynes manuals tend to be very weak on specifics having to do with
different model years and variations, they are good at teaching how-to
procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

=======================================================================

Should I use an oil additive in my Porsche engine?

     This is Stan's response:  "Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil.  Or as Bruce 
Anderson commented about something else, "a cash flow device."  Slick-50
is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case.  Guess what we 
all have, eh?  There is a bit of info on it via anonymous FTP in tta.com
in /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo.  Additionally, many of these additives 
use teflon.  DuPont (the inventors of Teflon) have stated categorically 
that teflon is useless in such applications."
 
=======================================================================

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other renowned Porsche people) here?
 
Yes. There are many luminaries in the Porsche world on this list.  If
something is relevant to them, they'll typically respond to you
privately.  Their participation is greatly valued, so respect their
privacy and don't try to draw them out in the open.  If they want to 
say something to the list as a whole, they'll do so.

=======================================================================

Where can I get a copy of the latest version of this FAQ?

     The FAQ is stored on tta.com in the /pub/porschephiles/FAQs 
directory, filename general-FAQ.  The version stored there will be 
the same one sent out monthly.  (There's also a FAQ that's specific to
the 914; other specific FAQs are welcomed, if anyone wants to contribute
to the archives.)

=======================================================================

Who maintains this FAQ?

     The FAQ is maintained by Walt Thode (thode@nprdc.navy.mil).  I have
a 1972 911T as my daily driver.  Anyone who wants to contribute can do
so.  Contributions, revisions, and suggestions for new items are always
welcomed.  I peruse the list for potential additions, but don't be shy 
about sending suggestions directly to me.

Subject: quick "airhead" survey

Since it's come up a few times recently:

How many current pfiles are also *CURRENT* pilots ?  Aircraft owners ?

How many of those fly airplanes with engines, how many fly those
where the designer forgot the engine (ouch:-) ?

How many of those flying engined airplanes have aircooled porsches ?

(I'm assuming no-one here flys a water cooled airplane).

Any body here build their own plane (no, somebody building it for you
doesn't count !) ?

Subject:      911 or MR2

A friend of mine wants a 911, but can't afford one.  He has heard a lot of good
 things about the '91 and later Toyota MR2 Turbos.  Does anyone have experience
 with these cars?  How do they compare to Porsche handling?  He said that there
 was a suspension problem with the MR2 that would cause the tail to swing out
 do a nose plow (sounds 911-ish!) during  hard driving.  But, that otherwise,
the car is a mid engine pocket rocket (and a great deal $).  Any responses are
welcome!  Sean  '80 928

From: William Oldham <oldham@EECS.Berkeley.EDU>
Subject: Plated Alloy Cylinders

The discussion on "Ceramichrone" reminded me that we have a jig
for plating 356 cylinders, a jig made up by Richie Lukes.  Richie
either used it or planned to use it to replate alloy cylinders
like super90's etc, and if I remember right he had chrome in
mind.  It sounds like from the discussion there may be
someone in the airplane technology business that actually has
access to such a process.  Or is there still "sprayed iron"
technology out there somewhere?  The 356 group here in the
SF Bay area would like to know about any leads in that
direction; as I said we have Richie's jig and certainly lots
of old  alloy cylinders needing new inner surfaces.

First of all, is this an "S" targa or a "T" targa that's been modified? 
 What do you mean when you say "S" package?  All of the standard S items 
were available as options on the T and E.  For example, my 73 T targa has S 
gauges and trim, but not the brakes.

    This "manifold" was on earlier cars than the SC, my original '75 box
    didn't have it but a '77 box did.

     Why not just leave the hole in it ? It sounds like you run much
    more risk ingesting a screw or lump of epoxy then just letting
    the hole stay there.  Unless you find a problem with it, I'd leave
    it. (Screw ingestion is one of the only killers 928s have, in fact
    you can look at the changes in the air-filter box on those cars and
    watch how the factory tried to avoid it).

     Or, take apart the box and remove the manifold entirely. If earlier
    cars didn't have to have it your SC should probably work without
    it.  Don't risk a head and cylinder for this.

         Good luck-Lee

From: Ed Mellinger <meed@mbari.org>
Subject: Oil Scum

Re: oil scum in winter

My '83 SC always has some yellowish oil-water emulsion around the filler
neck in winter, anytime average outside temps are below 45F or so.  More
after short trips, less after long trips, but always there.  Water vapor
is always coming out of the crankcase, and this is the first
cold spot that it hits (on its way to being sucked back into the intake
manifold).

It looks to me like a lot of this crud must drip back down the filler
neck into the oil tank.  This has never seemed optimum to me... but then
I was reading an article in R&T (or some such) in '89 or '90 where the
factory ran a squad of Porsche cars up to the north end of Alaska in
winter... to see how they'd hold up I think.  I remember that at about
40 below the 911 had trouble with *water condensing in the
crankcase vent hose and freezing to a solid plug*... until they got some
heater duct and routed the tailpipe back to blow hot exhaust on the vent
hose... then it was on to Pt. Barrow.  (You Minnesota winter drivers
might want to take note...)

 -Ed
meed@mbari.org

p.s. that same article had a wonderful quote from Porsche's R&D
chief, something to the effect that "your car must have steel in it...
the driver must be able to feel the razor edge".  Does anyone remember
this or have the actual quote?

Adam,

        Try to get Bosch arms if you can. I tried putting cheap wipers on 
my 944 and they just didn't clear the screen properly.

        Porsches usuallly come with Bosch arms and its worth replacing them 
with the same brand if you can find them.

Regards,
Philip

Subject: 951 Wheels


Does anyone have a set of wheels that they would like to sell for a 1989 944 
Turbo S?  (Aren't all 1989 944 Turbos the "S" model?)

I have a friend with this model car and he wants to get a second set of rims 
at a reasonable price for use in the winter.  He wants to mount snow tires 
on them.  This would allow him to make the occasional weekend trip up to 
Whistler (We live in Vancouver.) without risking life, limb, and sheet 
metal.

The wheels need not be perfect, but they shouldn't be completely unseemly. 
 Scrapes and scratches are okay, but major gouges or truly disgusting levels 
of corrosion probably won't interest him.

Direct all replies to me.  Thanks in advance!

I may be coming onto the market for a 911SC to replace my 944.  Can someone 
tell me the books I absolutely must read to educate myself?  I seem to 
recall from the FAQ (which I can't find any more) that Bruce Anderson wrote 
one.  Anything else?

Thanks in advance.

In 1961, with my wife and two kids, we picked up our new 356B Coupe at
Sonauto dealership in Paris. None of us had ever been in a Porsche before
(except to see if the kids fit in the back), much less driven one. We made
two wrong turns and immediately found ourselves in L'Etoile at lunch hour.

Can't remember how many revolutions we made. Went into it as a terrified
Porsche novice -- came out of it as a Porsche race driver. At least, I
thought so at the time . . . .

Subject: Tail Happy 911s

What with the recent thread on whether to let go the controls when in
a spin, I was wondering what the expert drivers out there recommend
when you start to lose the tail of your 911 ?

a)  Get off the gas. 
b)  Get on the gas.  
c)  Keep the gas where it is.
d)  Get on the brakes (presumably implying off the gas).
e) Something other than any of the above.

What is the recommended action (both pedals and steering) ?

Subject: TIRES FOR 930


Howdy Y'all,

Moving to Dayton, OH from San Diego is a weather shock.  Especially for the 
P700Z's on the Turbo.  On the rare occasions that it has been in the 
slippery stuff, I might as well be wearing slicks.

Overall, I've not been happy with the P's.  They require constant balancing, 
and have an extremely harsh ride.

What's the experience and recommendation for a better all around tire for 
Midwest weather and less harshness?

Also, on size, the rear stock size 225's are nice, but I think I could use 
some more meat back there.  What's the current thinking on sizes, sticking 
with the factory 16" wheels.

Thanks in advance for your help.

From: Mdch01@aol.com
Subject: Re:   931: Oil in the PCV air  

This problem sounds more related to poor engine oil control than to a turbo
related problem. The oil from the turbo just dumps out into the (top of the)
oil pan and should not go into suspension (hence ending up in the air
filter).  My 931 also shows signs of oil on the filter  - though not to the
same extent that your car does Mike.  Does your car smoke at all?  (maybe on
gear changes or during high boost conditions - maybe needs new rings?)
As an aside, EBS (Engine Builders Supply or something), who advertises in
European car has a high(er) performance rebuild kit available for the 931
with 8.0:1 CR pistons - for $700 which is not too bad - I am not sure what
else is included in this kit though.  I sent for their catalog several months
but have had no response yet.  When I rebuild someday I will consider some
sort of [quality] alternative to the stock bits.  What would a set of stock
931 pistons cost I wonder?

     Before you rush into this, I thought I'd add my 2p worth.  I believe 
the Bosch (=Autobahn at your friendly VW/Porsche/Audi dealer) are the best 
blades I've used and seen.  They are a little expensive but I think they 
hold up well over time.  Besides, new arms couldn't be cheap.  I think the 
way you can replace just the inserts works pretty well.
     If this seems to be my personal opinion and no one out there likes, 
just let me know.  But I've had good luck with the Bosch blades over the 
years.

I think they are (usually) a very expensive place to buy parts but
I just purchased (Bosch) replacement blades from Automotion for 
$3.96 each.  That's less than I pay for Anco blades down at the 
autoparts store.  I have a flyer that says they are having a %20 off 
sale on all parts Feb 7 through 10.  944 blades are $4.76 ea. 
There number is 1-800-777-8881
 vrooom,

P.S. By blades I mean the metal and the rubber (not just the rubber "blade").

Subject: 911 sub/wheels/short shift

Sorry that there has been no further info on the 911 salvage for the people 
who asked but I have not been able to followup for the last week.

My 86 Carrera came with pretty chrome/matched paint wheels. Don't know their 
origin but like most of them, the chrome is pitting so badly that they need 
their own maintenance man. Anyone have any suggestions, or a good set of 
alloys (16x7's and 8's) for sale reasonably?

Watched the commentary on the short shift. Anyone have first hand experience 
with installing on this late 915 trans version? What would I expect? Any 
difference between the factory version and say the Automotion version with 
claims it is the easiest to install?

TIA

Which makes me finally ask a question I've been stewing over for a while. 
How easy is it to replace the rear fender on a 911SC?  I know the fronts
are more or less a bolt on affair, but what about the back and the
roofline, etc.?

Subject: RE: 951 oil scum question

This is moisture trying to escape your oil pan.  It accumulates from 
high humidity levels typically, and is fairly common.  Make sure you 
change the oil frequently to remove this moisture (and other dirt, 
etc.) from the oil.

Sometimes water in the oil is caused by a head gasket or oil/water 
intercooler seal leak.  If this is happening you'll see/smell 
antifreeze in the oil, and maybe oil scum in the antifreeze tank.  The 
fix for these problems is more involved.

I've been down this road too, Adam.  The best thing to do is fork out 
for real Bosch arms & blades.  The blades can be had for around $8 - 
$11 /pair, and the arms, last I checked, were around $25 (dunno if 
pair/single).  You may be able to get arms from a used parts place.

Don't get the aftermarket "aerodynamic" blades; they're actually worse 
than stock and have MORE lift at speed, and are less effective.  I 
removed a set of these for a friend who bought them based on the sales 
pitch, and tossed them based on engineering.

I think this is a general wet/cold weather thing.  Sunday, drove 110 miles
from Charlotte to Columbia between 75-85, got my heart stepped all over
by my girlfriend/potential ex for about 3 hours, then drove back at a
constant 75.  Oil scum was still there when I got back to Charlotte.

This brings up another question.  After being on the highway for a while,
in 5th gear at RPMs, what, near 4000?, I noticed the oil pressure was less
than 1 bar per 1000 RPMs.  Is this okay, even though it violates the 1
bar/1000 RPM rule?  Or am I heading for trouble (please, I need no more)?

Subject: Re: Help..I screwed Up my pop-off valve installation!!


A small update.

I have determined (been told?) that the "gizmo" that I drilled into
was the cold-start fuel distribution manifold. It only appeared in 
81 (going by memory here...it was around then anyways) onwards. This
is why I did not see one in my neighbours 76S, or most of the people
on the net did not have one who have put in the valve. 

Anyways, the distribution manifold apparently was Porsche's solution
to reduce the amount of fuel in the airbox when the cold-start
(7th injector :-) ) was active. This is why the occurance of blown
air boxes is much less in the late model SC's, even though they 
still use CIS.

The hole is not that bid, and does not go **through** the manifold.
I am attempting an experiment using Locktite Copper gasket sealer
on some test cases. I have found a source for stubby stainless 
sheet metal screws, so I have used one of these in a test piece 
of sheet metal with the Locktite. I have also experimented with 
just using the locktite by it self, filling the hole like a plug.
I am also going to try forming a plug with the locktite, and then
us the locktite to seal that plug in the hole.

**Sigh**. I have used a combination of magnets, shop vac and sticky
tape to clean up all the metal shavings. There really was not that 
many in the box anyways, and it appears to be pretty clean now.
I have very little black plastic shavings in the air box because I
was using the shopvac while drilling the hole. 

The cold-start manifold must be no more than 1/2" below the bottom 
of the drill site...I would have realized that if I would have
read Mr. Anderson's book more carefully..of course you only see
it after the fact!

Anyways, I will keep you posted.

Subject: 911 Hard Start

I would like to solicit your opinion on the starting behavior of my 87 911.
When I cold start it takes 4-6 secs to start, then the idle oscilates
between 900 and 1100 rpm for about 15-20 secs.  If I restart it soon after
the engine is turned off, either hot or cold, it starts right up.
Occasionally, it starts in 1-2 secs when cold, maybe one out of seven times.
I don't think this is normal behavior (maybe the oscilation is) it seems
like it should start right away.  Any ideas?

I got to watch my 911SC get new rear fenders, new rear cross-piece and

That was *NOT* simple do it yourself job. Those fenders are seam welded into

This past Sunday I was motivated to re-organize the garage -- don't

running around shopping for baby wallpaper and gadgets, I was ready 
for a change.

I started off with the left side and was finished within the hour.  I 
went to push the 356 out of the garage and saw "Murphy..." sitting in 
the passenger seat next to "Secrets..." (Earlier in the week I was 
checking if the engine had seen a previous overhaul...).  So I sat 
down, opened to a page at random and started reading.

Two hours later, my wife found me still sitting in the 356, smile on 
my face, the book open in front of me, and the righthand side of the 
garage not even touched.  She laughed and inquired how the Super Joke 
was going -- I had no clue!  I tried to explain, but I don't think she 
understands...:(

There is something about the smell, ambiance, character, or?! of your 
special friends sitting in the garage.  The mixture of leather, oil, 
racing fuel, and rubber serves as an aphrodisiac that some get, some 
don't -- who cares?!  I enjoyed my Sunday afternoon "driving" the 356

Actually, Scott exposes a very good point here, one that I keep trying to make
every chance I get: just because something is good for racing does not mean
that it's even *USEFUL* for the street.... What you can tolerate in a full
race engine is very different that you want in a street engine. Why? Because
you're going to be tearing that engine down and rebuilding it with pretty
good frequency. At least once a season. Maybe more like every race if you're
talking IMSA or one of the serious pro series. That's just what you do.

So only getting say 10k miles of engine life due to a crappy air filter
is *NO BIG DEAL*... Here's the math: 10,000 miles at an average 100 MPH
is 100 hours of operation which is 3 to 5 times longer than the engine
lives *ANYWAY*!!!! So just because you use K&N on racing engines doesn't
mean *ANYTHING* about how good they are for the street!!!!! On the
other hand, a filter that keeps your engine *PERFECT* (yeah, right) for
100k miles is going to be *WORTHLESS* on a race car, because you will 
be losing some flow efficiency, and you can't afford that. Period.

Yeah, I run the K&Ns on my race car too, and *HIGHLY* recommend the ITG filters
for carb applications when racing...

Street, that's another can of beans entirely... Factory air and oil filters
ONLY (but would highly consider the Canton/Meca oil filter for street use).

(the Late) Dean Batchelor said 911's were galvanized starting in '76.  I posted 
this a week or so ago, and Bruce Anderson questioned me on it.  As I told Bruce,
I can't lay my hands on the book to look up the reference. but I remember it
pretty clearly, as that's one of the issues that was important to me when I
was searching for my toy.  Bruce told me that the issue is pretty controversial,
so I infer that the reference may not be correct.

Subject: Crankcase Cottage Cheese


Hi all, 

The phenomonom you describe is a form of condensation of oil vapor that
also occurs in 911 dry sump tanks. This occurs because the driving cycle 
is such that the oil does not reach full operating temperature to 
outgas the watervapor that condenses from short cycle driving.

For Mike Weilman and 924 Turbo owners, there is an oil trap 6 inches
from the air cleaner but 18 inches from the block. It almost never gets
hot enough to vaporize the water condensation, the normal purge cycle
of the vapor traps moves this white-ish goo onto the air cleaner element
ruining the element. I have removed the trap and cleaned it.

Pulsing vapor is caused by the pulses of the pistons displacing air in
the crankcase. Dark, oily vapor indicates blow-by, not good. Clear or
whitish vapor is condensation, just getting warmed up to get out of the 
system. Driving on the freeway for an hour or so should get things warm
enough to get rid of the condensation.

letting the wheel go can be a life saver,if u posse the skill. i have used
this technique many times at low and high speeds.i dont know where or how i
learned it but i can tell u that it really works.u see cars want to naturally
go straight,so when the force going side ways is so strong it becomes all
most impossible to to hold the wheel.the wheel will actually snap back to the
straight position!the important part is to stay on the power and remember to
grab back hold of the wheel!. if u lift be sure to get right back on the
power ultimately u want to stay on the power.if u lift and dont get back on
the power,round and round u go (just ask russ) P.S.this  also works in
motorcyling.

Subject: 911 Jacking Points


There was a thread a while back about optimal jacking and jack 
stand points for a 911. I don't know if it came to a satisfactory 
conclusion, but the January issue of the Pacific Northwest 
Region's PCA Newsletter has an article by Allan Caldwell in 
which he suggests jacking and stand points for all Porsche 
models.  For the 911/912/930 he suggests:

For the Front:  Jackpoint - Front Cross Support Box Beam
                        Jack Stands - Torsion Bar Covers or Body Hoist 
                                        Pads

For the Rear:   Jack Point - Engine with woods block
                        Jack Stands - Torsion Bar Ends

I originally asked the question and Bruce Anderson responded that _full_

galvinization started in '75 with the '76 model year.

The recommended technique is: go to your nearest PCA/BMWCCA driver's
education event or autocross school. Do not pass go. As with most
driving techniques, controlling an immenent spin requires precise
control inputs - it's not likely that you'll be able to read a book (or
read this email) and then be able to use this info with out some
practical training.

Weight transfer in a spinning / out of sorts car (911, 914, 944, it
doesn't matter) is a complicated thing: the worst thing you can do is
your #a or #d (they're effectively the same thing). Your car is starting
to spin: that means that you've lost traction on the rear wheels. If you
deccelerate (by braking or letting off the gas), you transfer more
weight off the rear wheels and to the front - making it worse!  This is,
unfortunately, the instinctive reaction. The correct response is to
steer slightly into the direction of the skid (anyone whose driven on
ice has done this) and get on the gas (but not enough to spin the
wheels: we're trying to transfer weight back to the rear wheels so that
they'll stick: if you spin them, what's the point?). This must be a very
quick, instinctive response. After making the correction, you need to
anticipate that the rear wheels will start to stick again. It'll happen
very quickly. When they do, you'll get a gob of weight transfer from one
side of the car to the other, causing the car to suddenly start to turn
the other way (a "fish tail"). Just as (it feels more like "just
before") the rear wheels start to stick, you must remove the steering
correction and straighten the wheel.  This is why most cars that spin
usually end up at the inside of the track: the driver didn't compensate
for the weight transfer after the initial slide was `caught'.  If you
overreact in the first place (the initial steering into the skid), it
makes the recovery that much harder (since the lateral weight transfer
is that much more violent).
 
If you've lost control, however (once the car has rotated to the point
that you have no hope of recovery), you're best bet is "IN A SPIN: BOTH
FEET IN" (hard on the brakes - press in the clutch and hang on until the
car comes to a stop).

I can't emphasize enough the importance of driver's ed - don't try this
without some instruction. It'll make you a better driver, and you'll
have a blast!

Subject: Ultimate Winter Porsche in C&D

I almost hate to admit reading Car and Driver.  But there is a really cool
photo in this months issue.  A 911 with a snow plow on the front and to cap 
it off, it's a turbo.

I wonder if IMSA would ban this from racing their precious Ferraris.

Subject: 913 924 Turbo Static Compression


Mike, 

The 1979-80 924 Turbo (US only) has a static compression of 7.5:1. the
1981-82 924 Turbo (US only) has a static compression of 8.0:1. It is
highly recommended that any 1979-80 that needs piston replacement use
the 1981-82 piston, size fitted per bore needed.

FYI, all Euro 924 Turbos and 924 Turbo Carreras use 8.5:1 static 
compression, with a different boost profile in the wastegate. These 
pistons work well, remember that the real compression goes to about
11.5:1 under full boost. There is no knock sensor, so be careful.

=======================================================================

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

=======================================================================

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

=======================================================================

Who is the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          Principal, 
          Technology Tranfer Associates
          P.O. Box 2087
          Bellaire TX 77402-2087

     (He got tired of living in Houston, TX and working in Edison, NJ,
so moved back...)

          Houston: e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
                   voice:  (713) 661-2084 

     His Porsches currently include:  
          '64 356 SC (daily driver)
          '74 914 2.0 (SCCA ITA/PCA Club Racing)

=======================================================================

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

=======================================================================

Are there any suggestions on how I should submit to the list?

     Beyond using normal good sense and discretion, you can submit
whatever you like that is relevant to Porsches.  You might want to use
descriptive "Subject" lines, including the model number when it is
relevant (e.g., "944 S2 Fuel leak query").  Your submissions would be 
easier for others to read if you make sure that your mailer wraps 
lines of text at 80 characters or less.

=======================================================================

How do I submit administrative requests?

     Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  

=======================================================================

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/archives.
Archives in six subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95) each of which 
has the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan
may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to mail you
archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY
mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program,
or equivalent, to restore to textual format.  Mac and Windows versions
of "uncompress" are available via FTP from /pub/porschephiles/programs.


=======================================================================

What else is available in the tta.com archives?

     FAQs: In the FAQs directory there is this FAQ and there are FAQs 
for specific Porsche models (so far there's one for 914s and one for 
the Carrera models -- feel free to contribute one on YOUR favorite 
Porsche).  These are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/FAQs.
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.

     PCA racing info: The PCA Club Racing Newsletter is now on-line,
thanks to the tireless efforts of the editor.  This is available by FTP 
in the directory tta.com:/pub/porschephiles/PCA/ClubRacing.  The 
newsletters are available both in PostScript and in Windows Write 
format.  If this is useful to you, send your thanks to the editor, Tom,
at "tt911@ibm.net".
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

=======================================================================
 
Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/Porschephiles/home.html.
The FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

=======================================================================

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions?  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts..."

     In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split.

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state/country of residence, their car's year and model, and
their net address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the
information, and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out
on a monthly basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't
send your Alfa Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send
submissions or changes to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

Which clubs are there for Porsche owners?

     Several different clubs are available, depending on your interests
and location:

          Porsche Club of America.
          P.O. Box 10402
          Alexandria VA 22310

=======================================================================

I want to join the Porsche Club of America; what do I have to do?

     The Club affiliates you with a local region based on where your
ZIP code falls on their territory map.  You *CAN* request to join a
specific region, and you can specify an affilate region or dual
membership in another region.  The local regions put on many different
events, some social, some educational, some driving or compeition
oriented.  The annual gathering of the whole membership, the Porsche
Parade, features competition for the national championships in many
events, seminars, a GREAT goodie store, and one of the most fun weeks
you'll experience.

     To join, you need to have a Porsche VIN number and be able to claim 
you're an owner, a co-owner, or hold a lease on a Porsche.  That may
seem restrictive, particularly if you want to join the club to get
access to Panorama, the club magazine, for purposes of FINDING a car...
In such case, it's suggested that you purchase a modest fraction of a
friend's car for say $5 or so, hence becoming a co-owner.  Just don't
tell them you did that or where you got the idea...

     Once you have a VIN number, there are four ways to join:

     1) Send a letter to the national office saying that you want to 
join, with your name, address, car info and a check for $36 to:

        Porsche Club of Americia.
        P.O. Box 10402
        Alexandria VA 22310

     2) Call them up at +1 703 922-9300, roughly between 9:00 to 5:00
EST (GMT - 6).  If you have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number
handy, you can do it over the phone.  (Otherwise, they'll send you an
application which you can mail in with your check.)  This is the FASTEST
way, and if you need to be a member *RIGHT NOW* to go to an event that
is members only, this is your best bet.  Don't count on using this
method the week of or before Parade...

     3) find someone active in your local region.  *MANY* of the regions
are represented on the Porschephiles list, so that's a good place to
start.  Once you have found someone, get them to put you in touch with
the local region membership chair, they can give you the form, and off 
you go.

     4) National membership chair Nann Weissenberger is also on the
list, and is reachable via e-mail at "nannw@aol.com".  She'd be more 
than happy to help you out.

=======================================================================

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     If you own a North American Porsche, Porsche Cars North America 
will, for a fee of $20, research the original bill of sale for your car
and give you a Certificate of Authenticity stating the facts and 
figures for the car as it was delivered to the dealer.  If you're 
interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  A similar service is
available in Great Britain from Porsche Cars Great Britain, for about
30 pounds Sterling.  Porsche AG can also perform a similar search.

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What are some of the major Porsche aftermarket suppliers?

     Be aware when buying a part in the aftermarket that it may or may
not be the same part you would get from Porsche.  This holds true even
when the part carries the "correct" Porsche part number, and when it
carries Porsche's parts trademark.  The following suppliers, listed

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.

Should I use an oil additive in my Porsche engine?

     This is Stan's response:  "Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil.  Or as Bruce 
Anderson commented about something else, "a cash flow device."  Slick-50
is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case.  Guess what we 
all have, eh?  There is a bit of info on it via anonymous FTP in tta.com
in /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo.  Additionally, many of these additives 
use teflon.  DuPont (the inventors of Teflon) have stated categorically 
that teflon is useless in such applications."

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other renowned Porsche people) here?
 
Yes. There are many luminaries in the Porsche world on this list.  If
something is relevant to them, they'll typically respond to you
privately.  Their participation is greatly valued, so respect their
privacy and don't try to draw them out in the open.  If they want to

Hi, Hubert.
 
Bruce Anderson's book is good. The absolute bible for Porsche history is
Ludvigsen's "Excellence was Expected" but it will not have as much
nitty-gritty buying information as Anderson.
 
Coming out in about 2 months will be a new 911 book which I am now translating
from German. It too is more historical but there are extensive technical
specs in the back (text and tables for specs alone are 103 pages). The title
is "Porsche 911 -- Forever Young" by Tobias Aichele. It will be sold by TPR,
Inc., (Dr. Brett Johnson of 356 Registry fame etc.) You'll see ads in the
usual places. Or do Brett and me a favor, bug your local bookstore to get
it. Start bugging in about 2 months, by that time we should have the word
out. (The more bugging people do, the more the book wholesalers who supply
the bookstores think that maybe this thing will sell after all, and then they
order it from Johnson).

Someone lately is forwarding significant portions of the Porschephiles

stop!  It creates so much chaff that the few grains of "wheat" that

Generally, it seems to me that forwarding the message you're answering

Stan said: "On the other hand, a filter that keeps your engine *PERFECT*
(yeah, right) for 100k miles is going to be *WORTHLESS* on a race car,
because you will be losing some flow efficiency, and you can't afford that.
Period."

What I'm going to say probably doesn't apply to Porsches and, for that
matter, may not be true at all -- for any car. But on the other hand. . .
.

Lo, those many years ago when I raced a Vee, I ran with an motocross air
cleaner (foam rubber with a coil spring inside to keep it from collapsing).
Apart from keeping big chunks of asphalt out of the engine, I had this
SECRET STRATEGY. 

I read somewhere that during dyno tests, a stationary engine pumped out a
small cloud of gasoline mist from the intake and it hung above the intake to
be swallowed again by the engine while it ran. Further, the engine needed to
injest this cloud to get whatever maximum performance it recorded by the
dyno. 

In those days I dyno-ed the Vee engine on my friend's Stuska after every
re-build, so we decided to test the theory. Sure enough, we did see a small
cloud of gas mist. The engine got 52 SAE (from a 40 HP VW) with the cloud.


Then we set up a fan near the intake to blow away the cloud during a test
and we got a lower reading. Then, armed with the air cleaner we ran another
set of tests. We did not lose any HP with this particular air cleaner. Then,
with the air cleaner still installed, we ran a test using the fan directed
at the air cleaner and did not lose any HP -- the cleaner had contained the
cloud and prevented it from blowing away. It was a genuine speed secret!

I ran the car with the air cleaner installed after that. Soon, most of the
SFR, SCCA Vee drivers ran the same cleaner. Then I took mine off.

Is this believable?

Subject: Tail Happy 911's - One of (probably) 32 meg of responses


From: Richard Hocking <hocking@cig.mot.com>
Subject: Tail Happy 911s

What with the recent thread on whether to let go the controls when in
a spin, I was wondering what the expert drivers out there recommend
when you start to lose the tail of your 911 ?

Disclaimer: I am not an expert - I only play one at Driving Events....

a)  Get off the gas.  (only if you want to see where you've been and not 
where you're going)

b)  Get on the gas. (only if you know what you're doing and/or have an uncle 
in the autobody business)

c)  Keep the gas where it is.  (only if you have the nerve)

d)  Get on the brakes (presumably implying off the gas). - see (a) above

e) Something other than any of the above.  (Yes!  Ask Al Unser Jr. to swap 
places with you.)

What is the recommended action (both pedals and steering) ?

"experts" recommend you turn in the direction that the back end wants to go 
(e.g., going through a right hander, the back end steps out to the left, you 
turn to the left) AND keep your foot on the gas. However, this gets back to 
Jesuit Philosophy 101 "can God make a rock so heavy even He can't lift it?" 
 - Or, more to the point, can you get your Porsche so sideways that even YOU 
can't catch it?  The answer is - that's why you need an uncle in the 
autobody business.

No two spins are alike.  There are no formulas at the limit and it takes 
luck, experience, luck, good reflexes, luck and did I mention luck? to catch 
your car when it starts to get away from you.  (However, when it does get 
away from you and you are in a spin - lock 'em up (i.e., press in both brake 
and clutch) AND if you are about to smack something HARD like the wall at a 
race track - unlock your thumbs from around the wheel.)  Why not join PCA, 
buy a helmet and a fire extinguisher, get thee to an autocross and find out 
if I'm right?

Subject: Galvanized 911s started when?

 
I'm translating a German book at the moment, "Porsche 911 -- Forever Young"
by Tobias Aichele. The technical section was written by my former next door
neighbor in Weissach, who based everything on company documents. He/it says
that hot dip galvanizing was introduced for STRUCTURAL chassis parts for the
1976 model year. By 1981 (but it doesn't say exactly when) all of the body
was being galvanized so for that year they extended the rust perforation
warranty to 7 years.

What to do when you break the back end loose?  That depends upon what you 
did to get there.  Let's look at a few situations.

1.  Let's assume that your car tends to oversteer (not uncommon for a 911).
    If you are in a corner too fast and the back end starts to slide, you:
    (1) don't lift the throttle (lifting the throttle would shift weight
    forward to the front wheels making things worse)  (2) carefully
    countersteer (make sure that you are looking where you want the car to
    go), and (3) after you scrub off speed, straighten out and get going.

2.  OK, you are in a turn and things are going well.  For some reason you
    lift the throttle (or hit the brakes).  Either action will shift weight
    forward to the front wheels.  Less weight over the back means
    oversteer!  (1) Get back on the gas (not too much, we don't want to 
    induce trailing throttle oversteer) (2)&(3) - see situation above.

Here are some general rules of thumb.

 - Lifting the throttle and/or hitting the brake will move weight from the
  back wheels to the front.  More weight over the front - more front
  traction - good for turn-in.  Less weight over the back - less rear
  traction - Don't ever do this during a turn.

 - Lifting off the brake and/or hitting the throttle will move weight from
  the front wheels to the back.  This rule breaks down when you have enough
  power to break the wheels loose.  In that case, extreme throttle
  application can induce oversteer.

 - If thing get out of control.  (1) both feet in - hit the brake and the
  clutch.  (2) look where you want the car to go.  (3) continue to drive
  the car as well as you can!  Whatever you do, don't let the car take you
  for a ride!

Subject: 914 w/s washers

    Well.... I've been doing a little net.shopping, and I think I've
picked up most of the little pieces parts that I need to get my 914 back
in top shape over the summer....  But there's still a few little
nonfunctional things left to fix.
    FIRST... My windshield washers don't work properly.  I am missing
one of the chrome washer nozzles and the hose that goes to it... no big
deal.  I'll pick one up somewhere later (when I'm actually driving the
car!)  But when I hooked the little hose up to the spare tire to test
the system, it sounded like there was flow at all times, not just when I
pressed the button (dash-mounted switch.)  Fortunately, I had not filled
the bottle, it was only air.  I thought I could feel air coming out the
nozzle and hose, it wasn't a leak in the line from the tire.  I'm
guessing that the problem is something stuck inside the dash switch... 
what do i do?  Just give up and get a new one, or if I were to just let
some kind of cleaning solution run through the switch (hoses to nozzles
disconnected, of course!) would it free itself up?  Ideas?
    Completely unrelated... I did a little informal survey a while back
as I was having problems getting my top to match up to the body of my
car... it seems that there were indeed at least two different designs
for the top latch mechanism, and I have a mismatch (the previous owner
of my car never had the top on, and he got it from a Porsche guy - I'm
guessing he just picked a top off the pile and handed it over -
unfortunately the wrong one!) - so if anyone has any spare latch pieces
that mount on the top, send description and price and I will see what I
can do.
    I have quite a few parts to trade, including an oil cooler and
front/rear suspension.  Someone was interested in the suspension a long
time ago, but his info. got e-munched, and I've been too busy to think
about shipping all that stuff.  Beside the top parts, I also need a
driver's door, taillights, and/or driving lights and grilles.  If you
have any of these parts and wish to trade, please let me know!  Sorry, I
can't pay cash unless I sell some of this stuff.

Thanks much,

Subject: 944 fumigation problem

I love driving my p-car!!! Especially on the rare days in Seattle when 
the sun is shining. I can feel it now, (reminiscing about last summer). 
I do, however, have a problem. When I roll a window down a couple 
inches, I get engulfed with air that smells like exhaust. This also 
happens when the windows are all the way down and when the sun roof is 
tipped up and/or removed.

Has anyone else experienced this phenomenon?

Is this normal for an '83 944? If not, what did you do to fix it?

Thanks for your help

Yup....if you buy garbage aftermarket mufflers (ie Speedy or Midas)
then the baffles inside the thing can collapse and clog up the
muffler.  Happened to my Dad and myself (on domestic vee-hicles).

We both noticed a definite lack of power....and you could see crud
being expelled from the exhaust as well when it got really bad.

Absolutely. The effect is called "vapor head" and design  of air filters
to *NOT* screw up vapor head is a most tricky thing for performance 
applications. You need to have something like 9" clear from the lowest
butterfly valve in the carb to the closest intrusion of the air cleaner.
That's hard to do in some cases, like 914s in EP trim...

So, you do the next best thing: the ITG filter referenced by Scott Jessen
and myself earlier today. It's got a foam "top" so there's no intrusion,
but the dual density foam give adequate protection.

My 931 used to do this.  The shape of these cars seems to put a pretty
good low pressure area inside the car while driving with windows open.
(You'll notice the heater flows much better with windows cracked
open.)  This also causes flow of air into the car through cracks
(primarily in the hatch area), which drafts exhaust with it.  My hatch
fits kinda poorly in this regard.

To solve the problem, look over your hatch seal.  See how it is formed
and how it mates.  Replace it and/or supplement it with
weatherstripping foam if there are leaks.  Make sure the hatch latch
bolts are tight enough.  Also make sure other holes in the back (tail
lamp assembly, fuel filler neck, etc) are sealed adequately, and caulk
them if they are not.

Finally (or maybe firstly), make sure that your exhaust system is
intact: no cracked pipes, loose manifold bolts, holes in cat or
muffler.  Listen under the hood and under the body for exhaust leaks.
Check that the air seal at the rear of the hood looks OK.. this
separates the engine compartment from the heater air intake.

The answer to your question G, is *Yes*.  There is no substitute for good 
"clean" power in any system.  Have you ever noticed in your car (or someone 
else's) that when you travel at moderate to highway speeds and interior 
noise levels are high (this effect is obviously exaggerated in a Targa/rag 
top) that you have a tendency to turn the volume knob up louder to hear your 
favorite tunes?  Sooner or later (usually sooner), however, the music begins 
to distort, and grows increasingly aggravating to listen to, so you turn the 
stereo off all together.  If this has ever happened to you, then (usually) 
you have experienced a condition called amplifier clipping.  If you could 
see the AC waveform being amplified by your deck or "head unit" it would 
look something like a sine wave with the peaks clipped off.  It is this form 
of distortion that makes all but the lowest volume levels annoying to listen 
to because your amp is essentially running out of power that it can supply.  
By adding a quality, larger, seperate amplifier, you can greatly increase 
the power available to your speakers before clipping and distortion set in.  
In the real world, most people think that too much power from a *big* amp 
will destroy your speakers. It is true that every speaker has a max 
continuous power rating that it can handle before it self-destructs.  It is 
well known, however, that too little power is more dangerous than too much.  
Frequently overdriving speakers into distortion using a small amp is more 
dangerous and destructive (especially to small speakers and tweeters) than 
the clean and clear power that a good amp provides.  Remember this :*Amp's 
don't destroy speakers......People do!*.  If you have an amp with lots of 
power, just remember to use it sensibly, and don't expect to crank up your 
4x6's to be heard in the next county.  I would definitely recommend using 
the amp if you have it.  The amp you quoted should be more power than is 
necessary for your four small speakers, but it will still improve your 
overall sound.  If you want to see the difference just temporarily hook it 
up on the front seat, and compare it to the sound without the amp (but I 
think you will notice a marked difference).  Also, Alpine is generally 
considered by most persons in the trade to be one of the better, more 
reliable manufacturers around.  If I had an extra, high-quality, high-power 
amp lying around, you can be damn sure I'd be using it in my car!

Just something else for you to consider.  If you find that you are pleased 
with your new system, you may want to consider the next step.  A subwoofer.  
Most people associate "subs" with "boomers"-- those annoying slammed 
pick-ups that you can hear from a mile away--who give the car audio trade a 
bad rap.  Subs are intended to accurately reproduce low bass found in most 
music, but boomers greatly exaggerate their capabilities into annoying 
others.  Small 5.25 inch speakers can't exactly produce low bass the way it 
was recorded.  That is where subs come in.  I understand that they are ugly 
and space consuming (the reason you removed the box), but properly done they 
can be asthetically integrated into the car.  I have seen successful and 
attractive sub installs in 911's in the front trunk, on the rear deck, and 
below the rear seat.  Subwoofer's themselves are not terribly expensive, and 
often times a properly built DIY box is all that is necessary.  Subs are 
generally considered to be of the 8", 10", 12", and 18" sizes.  Just one 
small sub can make a *dramatic* difference in the overall system sound.  The 
other issue is that you must have adequate power for a sub, but appearantly 
you have a "spare" two amps.  Why not put at least one of them to good use?

Once again, this all depends on what you want out of your system, but like I 
said before: often you don't know what's possible until you try it.  If you 
have the resources, why not use them to your advantage?

I'm happy to help with any other concerns you might have.

Actually you have a number of options.  In the audio world, an 8-track would 
generally be considered a "dinosaur".  You have a good plan, however, with 
hanging onto it.  I too live in the Northern Virginia area and would 
consider you brave for parking *any* car on the streets of our nations 
capital.  What many people don't realize, however, is that often the best 
form of security system to prevent stereo theft is none at all (theft of the 
whole car is another car).  Keep in mind that if a thief doesn't *know* you 
have a stereo system than he/she won't waste time fooling with your car to 
find out.  He/she will move on to more obvious victims.  In the industry 
this is reffered to as "stealth" installation.  It involves install 
techniques that attempt to completely hide any signs of an aftermarket 
stereo system.  This means that your plan to keep the ol'  8-track in the 
dash is a good one.  What is often done is that the stock head unit is 
disconnected (thus rendered inoperable), and a modern head unit (tape or CD) 
is mounted elsewhere in the car.  As you suggested, possibly under the dash 
out of view, or sometimes the glove compartment makes a good location (look 
around for potential places--I am not very familiar with the interior of a 
914).  Some higher end models even include infra-red cordless remote 
controls that can be used to operate difficult-to-reach head units while 
driving.  The majority of cassette and CD head units available today are 
either "pull-out" removable units, or the convenient "detachable-face".  
Also, at the extreme spectrum, it is possible to build what is called a 
"false front".  In this, the face or front (displays/buttons) of the stock 
head are surgically removed from the guts of the unit, and reassembled to 
look exactly like the stock head without the rear guts.  This "dummy face" 
is then placed over the front of the new head for disguise.  I have 
performed several such operations, and if done correctly, can provide a 
convincing anti-theft device.  

About the cassette, just ask yourself this question: How often do I really 
listen to tapes as oppossed to the sound quality of CD's?  Let your budget 
and the size of your tape vs. CD collection dictate which you choose.  I too 
agree that trunk changers are often cost-prohibitive, but you can get very 
simmilar performance from a dash mounted unit minus the multi-disc 
convenience.  IMHO I'm not a big fan of portable CD players in the car 
because only the most expensive models usually have adequate shock 
prevention (especially with a rough riding car), and they are often 
difficult to operate while driving.  Take your portable with you in the car 
sometime and see how it fares against road bumps.  

With the speakers, follow the advice I gave G in the earlier thread you 
read.  A basic speaker swap is usually a pretty straight forward DIY task as 
long as you replace with the same size speaker (measure to be sure).  Also, 
make sure you replace with the same polarity among your wires (i.e.  
positive wire to positive speaker terminal; negative wire to negative 
speaker terminal).  

It is really your own preference as to whether you will have enough power 
depending on how loud you listen to your music, if you drive with the 
windows down, etc.  See the earlier post I made to G regarding amplifiers.  
If money is tight you may want to consider purchasing a "high-power" 
cassette or CD head unit.  These units will offer you between 10-15 watts 
per channel of  *continuous* (don't confuse with peak power ratings), rather 
than the usual 3-5 watts of a conventional head.  If you want more *juice* 
then an outboard amp is the way to go.  You may be confused by the 
difference between a pre-amp, and an amplifier.  A pre-amp is actually a 
tiny amplifier inside your head unit that creates the low-level "signal" 
voltage that is sent to an external amplifier (or directly to the amp in the 
head unit that powers the speakers).  The external amp is fed this signal 
voltage, and in turn *amplifies* that signal and sends it on to the speakers.  

I hope this helps.  I open to any other questions you might have.

I'm not one to doubt Bruce, but my '72 is partially galvinized. The entire
floor and most of the bottom is galvinized, so if you see a '72 or later with
a rusty floor it is a basket case. Also I would bet money that the '76s

Hi, Hubert.
 
Bruce Anderson's book is good. The absolute bible for Porsche history is
Ludvigsen's "Excellence was Expected" but it will not have as much
nitty-gritty buying information as Anderson.
 
Coming out in about 2 months will be a new 911 book which I am now translating
from German. It too is more historical but there are extensive technical
specs in the back (text and tables for specs alone are 103 pages). The title
is "Porsche 911 -- Forever Young" by Tobias Aichele. It will be sold by TPR,
Inc., (Dr. Brett Johnson of 356 Registry fame etc.) You'll see ads in the
usual places. Or do Brett and me a favor, bug your local bookstore to get
it. Start bugging in about 2 months, by that time we should have the word
out. (The more bugging people do, the more the book wholesalers who supply
the bookstores think that maybe this thing will sell after all, and then they
order it from Johnson).

What I'm going to say probably doesn't apply to Porsches and, for that
matter, may not be true at all -- for any car. But on the other hand. . .
.

Lo, those many years ago when I raced a Vee, I ran with an motocross air
cleaner (foam rubber with a coil spring inside to keep it from collapsing).
Apart from keeping big chunks of asphalt out of the engine, I had this
SECRET STRATEGY. 

I read somewhere that during dyno tests, a stationary engine pumped out a
small cloud of gasoline mist from the intake and it hung above the intake to
be swallowed again by the engine while it ran. Further, the engine needed to
injest this cloud to get whatever maximum performance it recorded by the
dyno. 

In those days I dyno-ed the Vee engine on my friend's Stuska after every
re-build, so we decided to test the theory. Sure enough, we did see a small
cloud of gas mist. The engine got 52 SAE (from a 40 HP VW) with the cloud.


Then we set up a fan near the intake to blow away the cloud during a test
and we got a lower reading. Then, armed with the air cleaner we ran another
set of tests. We did not lose any HP with this particular air cleaner. Then,
with the air cleaner still installed, we ran a test using the fan directed
at the air cleaner and did not lose any HP -- the cleaner had contained the
cloud and prevented it from blowing away. It was a genuine speed secret!

I ran the car with the air cleaner installed after that. Soon, most of the
SFR, SCCA Vee drivers ran the same cleaner. Then I took mine off.

Is this believable?

From: Richard Hocking <hocking@cig.mot.com>
Subject: Tail Happy 911s

What with the recent thread on whether to let go the controls when in
a spin, I was wondering what the expert drivers out there recommend
when you start to lose the tail of your 911 ?

Disclaimer: I am not an expert - I only play one at Driving Events....

a)  Get off the gas.  (only if you want to see where you've been and not 
where you're going)

b)  Get on the gas. (only if you know what you're doing and/or have an uncle 
in the autobody business)

c)  Keep the gas where it is.  (only if you have the nerve)

d)  Get on the brakes (presumably implying off the gas). - see (a) above

e) Something other than any of the above.  (Yes!  Ask Al Unser Jr. to swap 
places with you.)

What is the recommended action (both pedals and steering) ?

"experts" recommend you turn in the direction that the back end wants to go 
(e.g., going through a right hander, the back end steps out to the left, you 
turn to the left) AND keep your foot on the gas. However, this gets back to 
Jesuit Philosophy 101 "can God make a rock so heavy even He can't lift it?" 
 - Or, more to the point, can you get your Porsche so sideways that even YOU 
can't catch it?  The answer is - that's why you need an uncle in the 
autobody business.

No two spins are alike.  There are no formulas at the limit and it takes 
luck, experience, luck, good reflexes, luck and did I mention luck? to catch 
your car when it starts to get away from you.  (However, when it does get 
away from you and you are in a spin - lock 'em up (i.e., press in both brake 
and clutch) AND if you are about to smack something HARD like the wall at a 
race track - unlock your thumbs from around the wheel.)  Why not join PCA, 
buy a helmet and a fire extinguisher, get thee to an autocross and find out 
if I'm right?

that hot dip galvanizing was introduced for STRUCTURAL chassis parts for the

What to do when you break the back end loose?  That depends upon what you 
did to get there.  Let's look at a few situations.

1.  Let's assume that your car tends to oversteer (not uncommon for a 911).
    If you are in a corner too fast and the back end starts to slide, you:
    (1) don't lift the throttle (lifting the throttle would shift weight
    forward to the front wheels making things worse)  (2) carefully
    countersteer (make sure that you are looking where you want the car to
    go), and (3) after you scrub off speed, straighten out and get going.

2.  OK, you are in a turn and things are going well.  For some reason you
    lift the throttle (or hit the brakes).  Either action will shift weight
    forward to the front wheels.  Less weight over the back means
    oversteer!  (1) Get back on the gas (not too much, we don't want to 
    induce trailing throttle oversteer) (2)&(3) - see situation above.

Here are some general rules of thumb.

 - Lifting the throttle and/or hitting the brake will move weight from the
  back wheels to the front.  More weight over the front - more front
  traction - good for turn-in.  Less weight over the back - less rear
  traction - Don't ever do this during a turn.

 - Lifting off the brake and/or hitting the throttle will move weight from
  the front wheels to the back.  This rule breaks down when you have enough
  power to break the wheels loose.  In that case, extreme throttle
  application can induce oversteer.

 - If thing get out of control.  (1) both feet in - hit the brake and the
  clutch.  (2) look where you want the car to go.  (3) continue to drive
  the car as well as you can!  Whatever you do, don't let the car take you
  for a ride!

Subject: 914 w/s washers

    Well.... I've been doing a little net.shopping, and I think I've
picked up most of the little pieces parts that I need to get my 914 back
in top shape over the summer....  But there's still a few little
nonfunctional things left to fix.
    FIRST... My windshield washers don't work properly.  I am missing
one of the chrome washer nozzles and the hose that goes to it... no big
deal.  I'll pick one up somewhere later (when I'm actually driving the
car!)  But when I hooked the little hose up to the spare tire to test
the system, it sounded like there was flow at all times, not just when I
pressed the button (dash-mounted switch.)  Fortunately, I had not filled
the bottle, it was only air.  I thought I could feel air coming out the
nozzle and hose, it wasn't a leak in the line from the tire.  I'm
guessing that the problem is something stuck inside the dash switch... 
what do i do?  Just give up and get a new one, or if I were to just let
some kind of cleaning solution run through the switch (hoses to nozzles
disconnected, of course!) would it free itself up?  Ideas?
    Completely unrelated... I did a little informal survey a while back
as I was having problems getting my top to match up to the body of my
car... it seems that there were indeed at least two different designs
for the top latch mechanism, and I have a mismatch (the previous owner
of my car never had the top on, and he got it from a Porsche guy - I'm
guessing he just picked a top off the pile and handed it over -
unfortunately the wrong one!) - so if anyone has any spare latch pieces
that mount on the top, send description and price and I will see what I
can do.
    I have quite a few parts to trade, including an oil cooler and
front/rear suspension.  Someone was interested in the suspension a long
time ago, but his info. got e-munched, and I've been too busy to think
about shipping all that stuff.  Beside the top parts, I also need a
driver's door, taillights, and/or driving lights and grilles.  If you
have any of these parts and wish to trade, please let me know!  Sorry, I
can't pay cash unless I sell some of this stuff.

Thanks much,

Yup....if you buy garbage aftermarket mufflers (ie Speedy or Midas)
then the baffles inside the thing can collapse and clog up the
muffler.  Happened to my Dad and myself (on domestic vee-hicles).

We both noticed a definite lack of power....and you could see crud
being expelled from the exhaust as well when it got really bad.

Absolutely. The effect is called "vapor head" and design  of air filters
to *NOT* screw up vapor head is a most tricky thing for performance 
applications. You need to have something like 9" clear from the lowest
butterfly valve in the carb to the closest intrusion of the air cleaner.
That's hard to do in some cases, like 914s in EP trim...

So, you do the next best thing: the ITG filter referenced by Scott Jessen
and myself earlier today. It's got a foam "top" so there's no intrusion,
but the dual density foam give adequate protection.

My 931 used to do this.  The shape of these cars seems to put a pretty
good low pressure area inside the car while driving with windows open.
(You'll notice the heater flows much better with windows cracked
open.)  This also causes flow of air into the car through cracks
(primarily in the hatch area), which drafts exhaust with it.  My hatch
fits kinda poorly in this regard.

To solve the problem, look over your hatch seal.  See how it is formed
and how it mates.  Replace it and/or supplement it with
weatherstripping foam if there are leaks.  Make sure the hatch latch
bolts are tight enough.  Also make sure other holes in the back (tail
lamp assembly, fuel filler neck, etc) are sealed adequately, and caulk
them if they are not.

Finally (or maybe firstly), make sure that your exhaust system is
intact: no cracked pipes, loose manifold bolts, holes in cat or
muffler.  Listen under the hood and under the body for exhaust leaks.
Check that the air seal at the rear of the hood looks OK.. this
separates the engine compartment from the heater air intake.

The answer to your question G, is *Yes*.  There is no substitute for good 
"clean" power in any system.  Have you ever noticed in your car (or someone 
else's) that when you travel at moderate to highway speeds and interior 
noise levels are high (this effect is obviously exaggerated in a Targa/rag 
top) that you have a tendency to turn the volume knob up louder to hear your 
favorite tunes?  Sooner or later (usually sooner), however, the music begins 
to distort, and grows increasingly aggravating to listen to, so you turn the 
stereo off all together.  If this has ever happened to you, then (usually) 
you have experienced a condition called amplifier clipping.  If you could 
see the AC waveform being amplified by your deck or "head unit" it would 
look something like a sine wave with the peaks clipped off.  It is this form 
of distortion that makes all but the lowest volume levels annoying to listen 
to because your amp is essentially running out of power that it can supply.  
By adding a quality, larger, seperate amplifier, you can greatly increase 
the power available to your speakers before clipping and distortion set in.  
In the real world, most people think that too much power from a *big* amp 
will destroy your speakers. It is true that every speaker has a max 
continuous power rating that it can handle before it self-destructs.  It is 
well known, however, that too little power is more dangerous than too much.  
Frequently overdriving speakers into distortion using a small amp is more 
dangerous and destructive (especially to small speakers and tweeters) than 
the clean and clear power that a good amp provides.  Remember this :*Amp's 
don't destroy speakers......People do!*.  If you have an amp with lots of 
power, just remember to use it sensibly, and don't expect to crank up your 
4x6's to be heard in the next county.  I would definitely recommend using 
the amp if you have it.  The amp you quoted should be more power than is 
necessary for your four small speakers, but it will still improve your 
overall sound.  If you want to see the difference just temporarily hook it 
up on the front seat, and compare it to the sound without the amp (but I 
think you will notice a marked difference).  Also, Alpine is generally 
considered by most persons in the trade to be one of the better, more 
reliable manufacturers around.  If I had an extra, high-quality, high-power 
amp lying around, you can be damn sure I'd be using it in my car!

Just something else for you to consider.  If you find that you are pleased 
with your new system, you may want to consider the next step.  A subwoofer.  
Most people associate "subs" with "boomers"-- those annoying slammed 
pick-ups that you can hear from a mile away--who give the car audio trade a 
bad rap.  Subs are intended to accurately reproduce low bass found in most 
music, but boomers greatly exaggerate their capabilities into annoying 
others.  Small 5.25 inch speakers can't exactly produce low bass the way it 
was recorded.  That is where subs come in.  I understand that they are ugly 
and space consuming (the reason you removed the box), but properly done they 
can be asthetically integrated into the car.  I have seen successful and 
attractive sub installs in 911's in the front trunk, on the rear deck, and 
below the rear seat.  Subwoofer's themselves are not terribly expensive, and 
often times a properly built DIY box is all that is necessary.  Subs are 
generally considered to be of the 8", 10", 12", and 18" sizes.  Just one 
small sub can make a *dramatic* difference in the overall system sound.  The 
other issue is that you must have adequate power for a sub, but appearantly 
you have a "spare" two amps.  Why not put at least one of them to good use?

Once again, this all depends on what you want out of your system, but like I 
said before: often you don't know what's possible until you try it.  If you 
have the resources, why not use them to your advantage?

I'm happy to help with any other concerns you might have.

Actually you have a number of options.  In the audio world, an 8-track would 
generally be considered a "dinosaur".  You have a good plan, however, with 
hanging onto it.  I too live in the Northern Virginia area and would 
consider you brave for parking *any* car on the streets of our nations 
capital.  What many people don't realize, however, is that often the best 
form of security system to prevent stereo theft is none at all (theft of the 
whole car is another car).  Keep in mind that if a thief doesn't *know* you 
have a stereo system than he/she won't waste time fooling with your car to 
find out.  He/she will move on to more obvious victims.  In the industry 
this is reffered to as "stealth" installation.  It involves install 
techniques that attempt to completely hide any signs of an aftermarket 
stereo system.  This means that your plan to keep the ol'  8-track in the 
dash is a good one.  What is often done is that the stock head unit is 
disconnected (thus rendered inoperable), and a modern head unit (tape or CD) 
is mounted elsewhere in the car.  As you suggested, possibly under the dash 
out of view, or sometimes the glove compartment makes a good location (look 
around for potential places--I am not very familiar with the interior of a 
914).  Some higher end models even include infra-red cordless remote 
controls that can be used to operate difficult-to-reach head units while 
driving.  The majority of cassette and CD head units available today are 
either "pull-out" removable units, or the convenient "detachable-face".  
Also, at the extreme spectrum, it is possible to build what is called a 
"false front".  In this, the face or front (displays/buttons) of the stock 
head are surgically removed from the guts of the unit, and reassembled to 
look exactly like the stock head without the rear guts.  This "dummy face" 
is then placed over the front of the new head for disguise.  I have 
performed several such operations, and if done correctly, can provide a 
convincing anti-theft device.  

About the cassette, just ask yourself this question: How often do I really 
listen to tapes as oppossed to the sound quality of CD's?  Let your budget 
and the size of your tape vs. CD collection dictate which you choose.  I too 
agree that trunk changers are often cost-prohibitive, but you can get very 
simmilar performance from a dash mounted unit minus the multi-disc 
convenience.  IMHO I'm not a big fan of portable CD players in the car 
because only the most expensive models usually have adequate shock 
prevention (especially with a rough riding car), and they are often 
difficult to operate while driving.  Take your portable with you in the car 
sometime and see how it fares against road bumps.  

With the speakers, follow the advice I gave G in the earlier thread you 
read.  A basic speaker swap is usually a pretty straight forward DIY task as 
long as you replace with the same size speaker (measure to be sure).  Also, 
make sure you replace with the same polarity among your wires (i.e.  
positive wire to positive speaker terminal; negative wire to negative 
speaker terminal).  

It is really your own preference as to whether you will have enough power 
depending on how loud you listen to your music, if you drive with the 
windows down, etc.  See the earlier post I made to G regarding amplifiers.  
If money is tight you may want to consider purchasing a "high-power" 
cassette or CD head unit.  These units will offer you between 10-15 watts 
per channel of  *continuous* (don't confuse with peak power ratings), rather 
than the usual 3-5 watts of a conventional head.  If you want more *juice* 
then an outboard amp is the way to go.  You may be confused by the 
difference between a pre-amp, and an amplifier.  A pre-amp is actually a 
tiny amplifier inside your head unit that creates the low-level "signal" 
voltage that is sent to an external amplifier (or directly to the amp in the 
head unit that powers the speakers).  The external amp is fed this signal 
voltage, and in turn *amplifies* that signal and sends it on to the speakers.  

I hope this helps.  I open to any other questions you might have.

   A friend asked me to post this for him. He is a sometimes-member of
porschephiles, but he has trouble keeping up with the volume. If you can
help him please respond to him directly at:   mba@intrepid.th.gov.bc.ca

================= Begin forwarded message =================

    I fit my '83 944 with an '86 Motronic box and all it would do is
    idle at approx 500 RPM.  Any throttle input resulted in stalling.
    I wished to use the later box so I could install a new EPROM.
    Any explanations?

I'm not one to doubt Bruce, but my '72 is partially galvinized. The entire
floor and most of the bottom is galvinized, so if you see a '72 or later with
a rusty floor it is a basket case. Also I would bet money that the '76s
are about as fully galvinized as any 911. Porsche had a '76 body (I think)
outside of their factory unpainted as a display to show how good the
galvinization was.
