i'm in nnjr/pca (nothern new jersey) and currently run an '89
951.

i instruct at pca (and sometimes other) driver education events
in the northeast - northeast meaning from charlotte to mt tremblant -
maybe 10 times a year.

besides my obvious interest in the current hot setups for 951, tires,
etc, i'm also bitterly interested in when the hell porsche will comes
out with another mid-engined car.  when do we get a 904 for the 90's??

I've always been dissappointed that the 924 was so practical.  Surely
by splitting the engine/clutch from the transaxel they gained a lot
of usable space and a 100 pounds of glass to hold the back end down,
but I still feel a water-cooled mid-engined design was within grasp,
using all the same off-the-shelf stuff that made the 924 possible.
With a longitudinal engine uncrowded by the front wheels there would
have been room for sophisticated exhaust sytems, turbos, intercoolers,
inboard brakes, the works.

There must have been some serious consideration given to this tack,
I should imagine, since such a vehicle would have been true to the
Doctor's 1930's F1 designs.

Subject: Wind vibration in 944


I had the sunroof completely off my 944 the other day (actually
a 951, but for this question it doesn't matter) and noticed
something interesting about the wind effects.


The other day, I had removed the sunroof and was driving with the
driver's window down, but I wanted to hear something on the radio so 
I rolled up the window. Immediately, the car felt like it was being
buffeted. Although it wasn't windy inside in terms of my hair being
blown around, there was a lot of change in pressure that I could feel
in my ears. And the windows seemed to be shaking.

Naturally, I immediately lowered the window a little ways, and the
pressure evened out.

Has anyone else encountered this? It seems like something the
Porsche engineers should have caught. Or is it an inevitable effect
of driving any car with windows closed and sunroof off? (It doesn't
happen when the snrf is just ajar; only when it's totally removed.)

BINGO!  Like they cancelled the 930 in the US so the Carrera could get a
foothold, so they c ancelled the 951 so the S2 could slip in.

Try adjusting the angle of the deflector.  If it is too low, wind enters
the car directly, ratherthan being deflected by the deflector.  I have
noticed this in attempts to increase aerodynamic effic. at the track
(too tall -w- helmet to run roof closed)

Mine has an old factory sunroof (no electrics) with
two settings:  in and out (removed).  There is a flap
which I reach up and adjust when it's removed to control
airflow over the top, to minimize the vibration.  I
assume it's an effect similar to making a jug sound by
blowing over the mouth, except in this case the cavity
is much larger, resulting a low frequency (2-10 Hz)
thumping.  _MS

I know Limerock pretty well, Bridgehampton less so, and the Glen I've
been around once.  I would like to drive Mosport (sp?), I hear it's
excellent.   BTW, who was the one who posted that his alternator
couldn't handle the amps he was using?  What kind of stereo do you
have that it exceeds the output of your alternator - and are you sure
that you're measuring the output at 3K RPM (~ the avg RPM for normal
driving).

Ah yes, the classic Helmholtz resonator.  This is common on most types of
cars (Porsches not excluded ;-) from Yugos to Lambos and Rolls.  It has to do
with a forcing function, the wind, a large cavity, car interior, and a
restriction, the window or sunroof.  Some car mags call this booming and it
can be really annoying.  As you found out the way to get rid of it is to
change the size of the cavity, not practical, stop the forcing function, not
desirable, or change the restriction, roll down another window or close the
sunroof.

I'm the guy with the alternator question. The stereo wasn't my idea -- it
was in the car when I got it. There's always a chance that down-grading it
is the right thing to do but.... Well, anyway, it's got the Sony 7190
removable, with a six-speaker plus subwolfer setup, cross-overs, bi-amped, 
for a total of 5 amplifiers putting out a combined total of 1300 watts RMS. 

The explaination I got about it was that since this was a European car mainly 
driven in Germany, that with the Targa top off and the windows down, you 
needed all this to hear the stereo at all on the Autobahn. My guess is that 
since the pervious owner was about 20-23, he decided it would be cool to put 
a stereo system in that was bigger than anything else anyone on the Army base 
he was stationed at had ever seen.....

And yes, I measured from 3000 to 5600 RPM, "normal" operating speed for me 
being closer to 4200....

 I know of at least one aftermarket 944 clutch assembly offered bu
 autothority.  (I'm a dealer who passes half the discount on on Autoth
 products).  I have heard, thru pano, of others.
 
944 clutches are:

1)  Heavy
2) Have those $#@%ing rubber doughnuts which fail in shear (notice, if
you ever handle one, the PERFECT 45 degree failure of maximum shear
stress).
 
The 951 units, which some of the aftermarket jobs are based on, since
the shaft splines are the same, have the quad spring set up as most
other clutches do.
 
I'm surprised Porsche tried this route twice after the 911S fiascos of
the mid-70s, which all failed in a similar manner.  It makes the
tranny/torque tube and shaft quiet onacouna rubber damps noise, whereas
springs tend to amplify it.
 
I'll take the extra noise.  944 clutches are no fun to replce (I'm a vet
of 2 such ops, one on a turbo)
 
I am reminded of a quote from my ferind Glenn, who helped me with the 15
hour job....
 
 "How much did you say porsche wanted for this job....
 Fifteen-Hunderd-Dollars?!?  No wonder.  Well, not to fear steve.  If you
 even need help on one of these again, give me a call.  I'll be glad to
 pitch in.  Pitch in goin' door to door to raise $1500 that is...."

Subject: 914 Wheel/Tire combinations

Just to add two more variations, I run 195/60HR15 Falkens on my
5.5 inch steel wheels with bags of clearance. I also run
in Auto-x 205/50 x 15 Hoosier DOT's on 5.5 inch 'empi style'
8 spoke alloys (<$70 from Barret Enterprises). Again there is
bags of clearance in the front but the rear is a little tight.

One problem with the alloys is their slightly greater offset than
the steel wheels, placing the center of the wheel a little closer
to the arches. I run with all camber plates removed, tilting the
rear wheels in a bit too. I also have tried a variety of rear springs,
old worn out originals gave me the worst clearance problem as they
were too low and too soft. Fresh 110# springs, fresh 140# springs
and cut down 140# springs(160# equiv) all give no trouble.

I have seen several 205/60 tires used on mahle alloy wheels with no
trouble either. I guess these have the proper offset.

	realize that many of you have no idea what the SP rules are, and
	they're too complicated to explain here, but hopefully someone will
	know the answer to this.  Which would be the preferable engine,
	under two conditions - price-independent, and price-dependent.
	Which model year would be the best engine to start with, and why?
(3) Chassis.  Which model year would be the best frame to start with, and
	why?
(4) What other significant changes happened over the various model runs?
(5) Price.  I know that only 3360 914/6's were built, and that they are very
	expensive.  I would expect that this can be done for as little as
	about $6K for the 2.0, and closer to 10K for the 6.  How about
	finding parts from the 6 to put into a 2.0 body?  Are these easily
	found, since many are the same as some 911's?

Any other comments are appreciated.  When the traffic dies down, I'll
summarize.  I hope to buy the car this fall, and build it over the winter
for the next autocrossing season.  We're just in the research stage right
now.

Thanks muchly, in advance.

Subject: Random notes on mechanics....

Well, I just got my 911SC back from my new mechanic. I'm quite pleased
with his work (so far...) relative to his immediate predecessor. And, as
a result, I'm in a mood to bitch about mechanics instead of getting back to
the random paperwork I came in to hammer out tonight.

Some background: I have used a guy for the last several years who has been
in business for nearly 40 years, and who has serviced Porsche and air-cooled
VW (which can be viewed as Porsches if you really think about it) for 
the entire time. This is a father-son operation, with the father as the 
original founder. Four bays, one of which usually has a restoration ongoing
in it (currently a '58 speedster with the original 4-cam engine -- drooool!)

For the 356 I had, and the 914 I still have, they've been pretty good. 
Actually, for the 356 they were outstanding. The father seems to have taken 
about a month a year to go to the factory for training and updates every 
year from 1956 through 1969, with ocassional trips since.  Their parts 
collection and contacts made finding NLA parts a breeze.

So, I had this great opportunity to buy the 911. I took it to them first and
asked if working on it would be a problem. They said it would not, and that
in fact, that if I didn't buy the car that they'd like to know about it. So,
finding that to be a confirmation of what I already thought, I sucked it up.
Well, some several months later it develops a pain in the electricals.  The
rear window defroster would "come on" after the car had been stopped for a 
while. Time to take it in, obviously. So, after a couple of days poking at
it they tell me that there is no problem with the rear defroster, but that I 
really need to have a new right heat exchanger installed, which they can do 
for, well, too much money. I pass on the heat exchanger, and take the car. 
And the problem, which still was with me.

No problem, this is Houston, it's summer -- I'll just unplug the relay and
worry about it later. Until the alternator gives up. At which point I take 
it back for another estimate. Which they give me --- $1300. I ask why, after
I recover. And they tell me: well, the alternator in my car has been 
superseded and I need a *NEW* alternator for $683, but I also need a pile
of other stuff to retrofit it, which incidentally involves removing the
engine from the car....

I passed on that, pulled the alternator myself, had it re-built by a guy
who has done TONS of Bosch stuff for me in the past, replaced the voltage
regulator, and figured I'd saved myself about $1100... Until it died again.

This time I took it into a shop recommended by the president of the local PCA
(of which I'm ashamed to admit I'm not a member -- but I'm gonna fix that
tomorrow!). These guys have only been in business for 17 years, and they do
mainly 911's and derivatives, and Ferraris (there was a BB512 in the stall
next to my 911 when I went to get it today. Christ, I'd *KILL* for a BB512...)
They have what looks to be about a class 100 clean room they use for engine 
and tranny work. They have 8 bays and a parts warehouse the size of my garage 
(which is pretty big, even for a two car garage).

Well, they found the short in the rear defroster. And a short in the wiring
harness that had the alternator slowly cooking itself. And another short
that was causing some other random grief. And replaced the alternator I'd
had rebuilt with one they rebuilt (with a 12-month warranty). And checked out
the engine, recommending I have one of the rocker shafts looked at real soon.
Didn't charge me for the relay and belt they replaced, even when I pointed
it out. Didn't charge me for towing the car in. I got out for about $440.

I'm impressed. And depressed. First question: did my previous mechanic lose
his mind, or is he just a loss for 911s? Second question: if this guy hadn't
been a big win, how do you tell from someone's recommendation if anyone is
worth a hoot??? I mean, I usually recommended my previous mechanic to all
and sundry from what experience I'd had with him, right? Third question: how 
can I get enough free time to go back to turning my own bolts all of the 
time (sigh), but still make enough money to keep my stable of Porsches???????

ENTRY-LEVEL PORSCHE AXED

Porsche will discontinue production of its entry-level model, the
normally aspirated 944.  When the German marque moves production
of the 944 from the Audi Neckarsulm plant to its own facility at
Zuffenhausen next spring, it will offer the car only with a turbo
engine.

To be badged the 944S3, the new Turbo will benefit from modifications
to the 2990cc 4-cylinder 16-valve powerplant, which hoist output from
208 to >>230<<hp.  And alterations to the nose and tail treatments,
directed by Porsche's recently recruited chief stylist Harm Lagay,
will give the car a rounder, bulbous look, more closely related
to the bigger 928.

When I bought my 944 (about 6 months back) the former owner warned me
that sometimes the cooling fan will turn on and never stop.  He said 
that the mechanic first diagnosed the problem as a bad cooling fan
switch but it was actually due to the computer chip coming out of 
the socket.  The problem was fixed by simply plugging the socket 
back in.  The problem has arose again and I cannot seem to find
this computer chip.  For the time being, I have taken the fuse out
and it has stopped the fan but the other fan continues to run whenever
the ignition is on.  Can someone please direct me on where this chip
may be.  I did do some probing under the dash I found this metal
box and it looked like the chip may be in there.  I was too scared
to open it in fear I may screw something else up.  By the way, I have
the 1984 model and I would deeply appreciate it if someone could

On a totally different topic,  I bought a tranny from PAR thursday,
drove up and picked it up, paid cash.  He said it was a little noisy in
reverse, but that it should be OK, beacuse the car it came from (quite
bent...) was driven in. (cash made it an out of state sale somehow and
made me just a delivery boy...therefore no sakles tax, which we don't
have in DE anyway)

$1500 later I arraived home.  I decided to run it through the gears just
to see how it felt.  1st:  smooth, smooth, smooth, LOCK. second, third,
fourth.. the same.  All the sudden, it just l;ocked up.  "KlanK!"

Reverse - Ka Klunka klunka Bang Klunka (this is out of the car,m turning
it with my HAND!)..  In reveres the outputs didn't turn, just kinda
banged back and forth.

I called Harry and Rich, who had rebuilt mine, and asked for advise..

Rich: "pull the gearbox off the diff and have a look..., if it has real
problems, PART should offer to replace parts or refund." 

I told him about the cash part, and he said Paul (the P in PAR) should
make good on it...if I was liucky..

So last night, I pulled my tranny, put it up in the pench and temoved
the gearbox from the diff case (trans is 3 peices - diff case (looks
like bellhousing and outputs, - gearbox, actually has all the gears and
shafts in it, and end cover, a 6" long casting which the ends of the
shafts, fifth, and reverse are housed).  Sure enough, the pinioon
bearing race was removable with some forcefull pulling with the fingers.
If the race is seated properly, you have to get the trans up to about
250C and use a puller to get it out.  Needless to say, it wasn't
although I still couldn't pushn it back in.

Next I decided to take a look inside the PAR trans.  WHen I separated
the gearbox, this stuff that looked like anti-seize oozed out (like
dirty mercury, real shiny).  In it were various broken metal
peices...like gear teeth.  

Looking at the exposed gears, first, second and third all had teeth
ripped out from BELOW th root.  Inside the diff housing, I could see
that the gear that drives the trans cooler (about 5" in diameter, 3-4mm
thick) had NO teeth whatsoever!

The edges of the pinoin gear were so worn, the faces actually met in a
knoife edge (there is usually a 2-3mm falt at the top).  Needless to
say, the trans is JUNK.

Sleep did not come easily, ebven though it was 2am by this point.

I called PAR this morning at 9, and asked to speak with paul.  I told
him my tale of woe, and he apologised, and said he would be glad to
refund my money...if I wouldn't mind returning it (PAR is in the heart
on Yonkers, about 7hr round trip for me).

At least I'll get the money back...though two days in transit are
wasted.

No trip to the Bridge this weekend, unless I can locate a new pinion
bearing and have it delivered by weds A.M.  That would still make things
pretty tight, given finals are eminant...but we can always hope.  At
least I'll have a fresh set of Synchros to abuse!

Well, I recently repaired this problem on my car.  Do this:  reach up
and undo the 2 wires on the back of the thermostat (drivers far side of
the radiator, enine side, half way up.  If the fan stops, it is your
switch.

There is a relay in your fuse box, the big rectangular job (I assume
twin fans as on my turbo)  

One of the fans is activated by the A/C unit,the other by a
thernmostat...

BTW...the two wires on the back of the fan thermostat can be pulgged in
any order...a closed connection turns the fan off.  I just had this
problem on my turbo and the thermostat ($25.00 or so) fixed it.
Surprisingly, at least on all later models, it is a 951 part number.

As far as I know (and I may be wrong) there is no computer in the system
for temperature.  The only computers in use are the cruise brain and the
DME (and for turbos the KLR).  I think the former owner was confused.
Try the above as a check.  Also, try removing the relays, though if
these are loose, it should result in an always-off fan.

 That would make our cars look like 924s.
 
 Remember that LeMans car?  that was a 16V....425Hp....In 1982.
 
 Time to invest in an S2...do the mads, and surprise a few freinds.
 
 Frankly, Motor Trend is usually full of shit.  I have a hard time
 beleiving Porsche would make an S3 cabrio...and I really can't beleive
 them dropping the cab.
 
 Secondly, Porsche has gone to grat lengths to make sure the air cooled
 boys stay on top HP wise....the 930 has ALWAYS been the top dog.  D you
 really think they would let the 930 be bested by 10 hp, and prob 100-150
 less lbs?.....by a 4cyl?!?
 
 No way.  230 is definately wrong (since you have 247 in a porsche 951
 certified bulletproof config)....
 
 On the other hand, remember the siamesing of the cyls in the S2....talk
 about some hot spots under boost!
 
 Horsesh#t I say.  Motor trend is just that...the bulbous body 944 has
 been seen in spy phoitos for a while...also, Auto Week hasn't mentioned
 it...we're talking at least 2 mos of aging on any Motor Trend story.

  I have a question for those of you who actually work on your cars:
 Recently I've been involved with a friend's (1979 Euro) 930. Right now its
 most pressing problem is the front suspension. After getting tangled up with
 a red-light-running chevette his RF has about 3.5 degrees of negative camber.
 We took the car to a local frame/axle shop and they diagnosed the problem as
 a bent strut...any ideas for verifying this, short of buying a new ($650!!)
 strut and then re-measuring the camber? Yes, it is at its adjustment limit.
 They said the frame (unit body) was straight, and attempting a "hydraulic fix"
 would mis-align the body panels...
 We think the strut was replaced following the accident, but cannot locate the
 shop paperwork to verify this. The car has OEM (Porsche) units on all four
 corners, so going to an aftermarket strut would be to replace not one, but
 both fronts....the accident happened about 4 years ago, and the car has been
 chewing up tires when it's driven (had been off the road for the last 2 yrs)
  Anyone got any ideas? He just put a fresh set of Comp T/As on the car and 
 would like not to replace them too soon!

Why not swap the left and right struts?  Can you do that on a 911?

First of all, make sure you mean strut and not just the strut insert.
Most people say strut and mean insert.  The insert is the shock
absorber part of the strut.  The only thing that can bend
on a strut that would affect the camber is the axle, but if the axle
were bent the brake disk wouldn't spin through the caliper, so it's
not that.  The insert is easy and cheap to replace, if that's what is
bent.  You can't swap R and L *struts* (on ANY car), they are a mirror
image of each other, but you can swap the inserts.

The other likely candidates are the A arm, or the frame of the car
itself.  The A arm can be inspected visually for dents or bends.  If
not that then the frame got bent and it's expensive to fix, but it is
possible. 

Oh, and BTW, not to start a flame war or anything, but I think 944s
are ugly.  nya nya.

Ummmm. I've bent the whole strut tube before, which is a major loss.
You can tell if the tube is bent by trying to install a known good strut
insert. If it binds, it's broke.

And I usually get a used strut instead of buying a new one....

OK, that's hard to do, but it is possible.  it is also very visible,
since it will crimp if it bends (as tubes are prone to do).  And
buying a used one is definitely the way to go.

Well, that's wrong.  You can replace the damper, in fact it should be
done roughly every 50K.  Now that I think of it, the 930 strut tube
has a wider ID (inner diam) than the normal 911, with the same OD.
Meaning the walls of the tube are thinner (in order to accomodate a
stiffer shock).  If the tube isn't visibly bent you might try Stan's
idea to double check the tube is straight.

>If the spindle bent right where it

No, take a look at the strut and you'll see why, the caliper mounts on
the strut, and the disk mounts on the axle, two different places on
the strut.  I've seen this happen, the force to bend the axle is not
enough to bend the caliper mount (which is very strong), or if it does
bend it's not as much, and the disk ends up not being able to turn
through the caliper with the pads in, normally the clearance is very
small so any slight aberration in the geometry there would be
noticable.

The tower to tower measure isn't going to tell you much.  If I were
doing it, I would check the front torsion bars...

Get under the front and measure the distance between the torsion
bar tubes at each end - the front torsion bar tubes run longitudinal
to the car, one for each tire, and they should be parallel, so the
distance between them should be the same at all points.  If the
distance is off then the frame is bent.  I've gotten a car dirveable
once by re-drilling the mounts for the torsion bar tube and moving it
to make it even but that was a real butcher job.  It's not something I
would recommend for a 930 (only because it's a beatiful car and
shouldn't be butchered).

Hard to diagnose without seeing it...hope this helps...

Subject: 944S oil consumption

I recently purchased an '87 944S with about 22K miles on it. I have
taken the car to two Porsche club drivers education events at Lime Rock,
and on each occasion the car has used about 1 quart of oil per day
of high speed track driving (a little over an hour, about 80 miles).
I am looking for ideas on how the oil is being burned. I assume the
latter, since there is no evidence of a leak, and I would expect lots
of evidence for a multi-quart leak. On the street, the car does not
seem to burn any oil, although I only have relatively short observation
intervals (several hundred miles each) due to oil changes, the above 
mentioned track events, etc.

At the first event, the car had dealer-installed oil, which I believe
was Valvoline 10W-40. My impression was that the oil use was higher
when the average RPMs were kept higher for a particular run session
(15 Min.). At Lime Rock, this car seems to have a choice between 3rd
gear for a significant part of the track (from the end of no-name to
after the downhill), or 4th gear. In 3rd, the RPMs are in the 6000-6800
range for this portion (about 1/3 of a lap), in 4th they are in the 
4200-5000 range. When I ran a run group using 3rd in this area, the
oil usage was higher than another run group where I used 4th. Other
run groups used a mix of shift points, so I don't have very much
confidence in the data.

For the second event, I changed to Mobil 1 (15W-50). I also disconnected
the line from the (otherwise sealed) crankcase to the intake system
(which connects between the throttle and the airflow sensor, where there
is a very small vacuum), plugged the input system line, and ran the
crankcase vent to a catch tank. The car still used about 1 quart that day,
and almost no oil appeared in the catch tank (perhaps a few tablespoons
of water-oil emulsion). I didn't get additional data on the RPM influence.

Does anyone out there have experience in the oil usage of 944 series cars
in a track application? Any guesses as to mechanism, or possible
diagnostic gimmicks? There seems to be little blow-by or loss of power,
so I am inclined to think it is not rings. There is an oil pressure
reduction valve in the oil line to the valve gear of the 944S. Does
anyone know its purpose (I believe it is not on the 2 valve models)?

What is the current importation stsus of the 959.  Last I heard from

Any news on this?  Can you buy one in Europe and bring it in?  I read in
Excellence recently that the 8 at holbert were shipped back (oooh, I
actually TOUCHED one there!)

Any info would be appreciated.  I know thet there are no street legal

a few weeks ago someone wrote a column in autoweek about how he saw
an honest to god 959 on the road near san francisco and tried to follow
it, called the dealer whose plates were on the car (and got a brush-off,
etc).

a few weeks later autoweek reports that treasury (or customs - i forget
which, but they're all from the same mold, right?) officials, *really*
pissed and hungry officials, are hunting this car down too.  probably
leaning on the dealer to no small extent.

the poor owner ... i mean the *unfortunate* owner ... he must have had
to arrange all kinds of goo and greased all sorts of palms - not to mention
the gazillion bucks porsche charges for the car (if indeed he got it
first-hand) - only to have some schmuck yell out his secret to the press..

..and then to add insult to injury, timmins blows him off in his 454
chevelle.  what sort of world is this anyway?

well, we will never see one on the road here.... legally.  There are new
gray market laws where DOT can ask the maker if the car is similar to
any here in the US.  if so, no legal way to convert it here.  In a round
about way, the makers of cars have total control over the gray market
in the US.  this is advantageous to them, since they lose $ from the
gray market.

besides, Porsche would of have to crashed 7 (or is it 2) for crash tests.
Ferrari did it for the F40.  too few to do.  Porsche would of have to have
sold the 959 for over $300,000 to recoup their R&D for the car.  that's
before legalizing it for here.  Porsche justifies their loss by stating
that the car is a rolling experiement, with emphasis that the technology
will trickle down to other cars.

i believe, each 959 owner is instructed/suggested to have their cars
serviced by factory sanctioned shops only.  this is because they can
study the car in its day to day life and can keep records for future
development efforts.

i think the only way for a person to have the 959 legally here is to have it
as a work of art.  that means no road use.  that does not mean an owner
can't rent a track and have fun there.  so, the article in Autoweek
was correct to assume the excitement of it all.  and yes if the gov't
boys ever caught the guy, they have the right to confiscate the car.
WHERE'S THE AUTION !!!

i also heard, there are 2 in storage in SF and the owner's (some silicon
valley types) are trying to get them legalized.  the boys are keeping a close
eye, cause any attempt to drive it, and guess what? it's the gov't's.

i think the real sorry point about the car is that it has no racing class
it belongs to.  since gruppe b in rallying has been illegalized (but
have been overturned in a french court, but don't expect to see this class
back).  In road racing, well, it can be beat easily by lighter cars since
awd is not that much of advantage.

case in point, 89's gto series, between
the Audi's and the Cougars.  i saw them race at Laguna Seca (with the F40,
with Jean Alesi driving.  BTW, he is a up and coming World Champion in F1.
with sh*tty tires, he still managed to come in 4th.  and only because of
pure driving skill.  and the reason, no handling due to pirelli's).
The cougars are fast, just as fast as the Audi's.  even faster at some points
of the track.  the real factor of awd is this.  with Hans Stuck (ex-factory
racer for Porsche, guess he's waiting for better things from the factory
for endurance racing where Porsche really belongs and should dominate
if they would get their hands out of CART and now F1 again?) world's greatest
rain driving for sports cars and awd, if it rains, the rest of the
field can just go home.  otherwise, it's not that much of an advantage.
plus the weight and reliability plays a part.

sorry for rambling.  i could of just said no 959's legally here in the
states.

This exact fate fell on my beloved '67 912 when the subsequent owner turned it
into a 930 wannabe.  It inherited a Kremer 935 look a like front end.  The
result looked beautiful but it was very sad to think about all the great years
and miles and smiles that car gave me.
 
My '67 912 was the 26th 912 to have the larger disk brakes of the dual system
cars, but without the dual brake system.  There were only about 100 or so of
those made.  Mine was also assembled at the Porsche factory, not at one of the
other plants.

If it's a pre-'69 911 or 912 it is very easy for those of us who have
owned/loved/cared for those cars to tell right away.  The wheel base got
stretched in 1969 and the body contours show it.

I don't know but somebody better get their hands back on the steering wheel
instead of their .....   And get their mind back too.  I don't know WHAT the
relationship between $70k and a 959 is...  We obviously have more than two
tiers here flamers...  we've got everything from Porschetrash 914's (which is still
a profound class of automobile) to 959 CyberPorsche Dream machine...

Maybe if you can't stand the "friction" you should get out of the executive

Maybe I'll never drive a 959.  Gee by the time I get stable enough to consider
buying one, I'll probably be shopping for something better...

Do we really have to resort to 914 bashing here (and then trying to
parenthetically cover our ass?)

While we're (ever so conveniently) discussing 914's, I could use some info on
suspension setups.  I have a stock 1974 914 2.0 without sway bars.  I've
basically decided on tires.  I'm going to go with Yokohama AVS Intermediates in
195/65VR15 (same rolling circumference as the original tires +/- 0.6%).  I just
bought a (used) set of Riviera alloys and I assume these tires will fit and
clear the wheel wells.  I also have the original 5.5x15 steel wheels.

My initial inclination is to replace the rear springs with something on the
order of 120lbs, and go with the Boge shocks.  My other options include
Konis/Bilsteins at twice the price, and/or larger torsion bars. I don't want to
go with too stiff rear springs, as I'll be using the car on the streets quite a
lot.  It will see some time at Lime Rock, so I don't want it sagging/swaying all
over the track either.  Ideas?  Opinions?

Do you have no sway bars by choice, or did it come that way?  I've heard
that the fast setup for 914's is a big front bar and no rear bar (you want
to keep that inside rear on the pavement).

Here's an excerpt of rec.autos.sport/info-vw posting in response to my
earlier 914 research...  Again, I'm planning on setting up a 914 for next
year's autocrossing season, and would like any help.  I'll send another
message about that.

Subject: 914 project research

[This is a resending, since I got *NO* response to this a while back.
 C'mon, porschephiles!  I got great help from the info-vw and autox mailing
 lists...  Some of you must know *something* about this.]

For next season, I would like to put together a 914 2.0 or 914/6 for
autocrossing, set up for SCCA Solo II Street Prepared category.

I can freely interchange parts between the 2.0 and the 6, any model year.
The 1.7 and 1.8 are not in the same class, so I can't use parts from them.

(1) Size.  Wheelbase, length, width, weight.  Any changes to this over the
	model runs?
(2) Specs.  How much power did they have stock?  Any idea What's a reasonable
	amount to expect from either engine in Street Prepared form?
	Which would be the preferable engine, under two conditions -
	price-independent, and price-dependent.  Which model year would be
	the best engine to start with, and why?
(3) Chassis.  Which model year would be the best frame to start with, and
	why?
(4) What other significant changes happened over the various model runs?
	I know the following:
	- 914/6: 1970-1972
	- 914 2.0: 1973-1976
	- The 914/6 had the 2.0l 6 from the 911T, 5-bolt wheels on 911
	  brakes, different instrumentation with the key on the left.
	- I don't know anything about year-to-year changes.
(5) Price.  I know that only 3360 914/6's were built, and that they are very
	expensive.  I would expect that this can be done for as little as
	about $6K for the 2.0, and closer to 10K for the 6.  How about
	finding parts from the 6 to put into a 2.0 body?  Are these easily
	found, since many are the same as some 911's?

Any other comments are appreciated.  When the traffic dies down, I'll
summarize.  I hope to buy the car this fall, and build it over the winter
for the next autocrossing season.  We're just in the research stage right
now.

Thanks muchly, in advance.

For Sale:

- 1980 924 Turbo

- mileage unknown odo says 65,000, doesn't seem like 165,0000, but then again...
- "four bolt" suspension
- body is solid and rust free, parking lot dent RR corner
- new front suspension bushings, tie rod ends, ball joints, koni adjustables
- new waste gate
- rebuilt transmission (if you can believe Kempton Bros, I don't)
- last straw was (I'm presuming) that wrong head gasket was installed leading
  to blown head gasket
- ran strong
- factory manuals
- although solid, all I dare claim is fair condition

I'm sick of this car, although it was the best braking, nicest handling
RWD thing I've ever driven, with the possible exception of a mid 70s V8 fuel
injected MB sedan a friend of mine had over in Europe.

Maybe somebody with a high $ street car would like it for beating on

It's had a hard life, I've tried to treat it well, but it's not working out.

Okay, not to bash anyone's car, but there is a _distinct_ difference between
these fine _air_ cooled 4 cylinder (real) Porsche's.  I do place the 912 in a
different class, due to parentage.
 
The 912 and 911 lines (don't know about any of the liquid cooled whiz kids)
use .049 thick steel and are constructed with seam welding.  The 914 (even the
914/6) use .035 thick steel and are spot welded.  Examination of data plates
show the 914's to be VW-Porshe made and the 912's to be Porshe made.
 
I always liked my 912 for the 32 mpg and 120 mph performance it gave me.  Many
were the BMW 2002's that saw `912' dissappear in _front_ of them in the mid to
late 70's.  Still brings a smile thinking about it.
 
As to the question, does this make the 914 less of a Porshe?  Does the fact
that a Dino 246 GT never say Ferrari anywhere on it make it less of a Ferrari?
BTW, if anyone wants to discard any of these fine machines please throw them
my way ;-).

Date: Fri, 18 May 90 16:37:21 +0100


	Greetings from Scotland !!!

	Thought I would throw my bit in about the recent discussion of 
THE 959. ( no imitations will be mentioned ).

	Last year when the Scottish Motor Show was on ( you know the one where 
all the new cars are launched :-) ) our local Porsche dealer was not present ( a
pparently not their decision ). 
	Anyway to make up for the dissappointment of all these people who only 
go to a motor show to see a Porsche they put on something special at the dealers.

	They transported a 959 up from England ( where ?  :-) ) together with a
  Ferrari F40 which the U.K. importer owned ( twas a Ferrari dealership as well ).

	So of course I had to go along . A red F40 and a white 959 under the same roof.
	I took my camera along and took some photos , but most of them didn't 
come out ( was most dissapointed ).

	So I can say I've seen  959 and an F40 :-) .

	See ya later,


			John....

P.S. Waiting list for 911 at local dealership is 2 years for a Ferrari its 7.

Lucky dude.

well, to reiterate, i saw the IMSA GTO F40 with Jean Alesi driving.
it looks just like the street car except with a more agressive rear wing.

no porsches to defend the marque though.  what the h*ll happened?  i hope
porsche gets into serious racing, instead of this hollywood type of
attitude of f1, cart and bs like that.

Porsche, i beg you, get back into sports car racing!!!  this is where you
belong.  it is truly a sad day when Joest Racing has factory backing
for the world sports car racing series.

i personally would like to see racing, not the big politics/show/prima-donna
type racing.

but i guess, honda sells lots of cars due to its f1 motor.  yeah, but how
close is the comparison between a v10 (v12 soon) to the 4 cylinders they
put in civics?

marketing magic i guess.

am i alone in this?  am i a minority?  let me know what you think?

i agree completely.  what in the WORLD is porsche doing in cart??
and being just an engine provider, fer chrissake??  gosh, how
wonderful that honda can supply killer engines (after spending
$0.5 BILLION) to formula one, and gosh how clever of nissan to
pay don devendorf to call his creations nissans (is there a SINGLE
nissan part in the nissan gtp's?), and wowie gee peter sauber
decided to use mercedes engines so mercedes now pays him to paint
his cars silver...

... BIG EFFING DEAL!!

porsche got where it got in racing by building the WHOLE car,
in weissach.  not only that, for a long time their race cars
were useable on the street.  bye bye, 904 (and thanks a lot,
herr prof dr piech).  ah, never mind, i can rant on that subject
for a LONG time .. but at least porsche incorporates stuff they
learn in racing to street cars.  i still get a kick when i
buy pads for my 951 and the box says 917/930/951 on it.

so, porsche, screw cart, screw formula one, get back into sports
car racing!

Sure, pleanty of both:

I use the Troutman 160 lb progressive rear springs, with 21mm front bars
and KBB shocks (which get replaced every 9 months or so). I like the way
it drives in that configuration. I also had it corner balanced for my driving
weight, since I weigh about 280 lbs and it DOES make a difference.

As to tires, the AVS are great tires, as are Dunlop D40M2's. However, I'm
now lusting after a set of CompT/A ZR's....

As to wheels, I'd recommend against the Rivera's since they're cast not
forged. I'd try to scare up a set of the *original* 2.0 alloys (which you 
should have on the car, BTW) or if I was really going to get crazy, I'd
have my hubs re-drilled for the 911 bolt pattern in the rear, bolt in a 911
front end, and go with 15x6 Fuchs rims all around.... (and, if I hadn't 
discovered that my 914 is all original and hence restorable, that's exactly
what I'd have done with it...)

A low cost alternative may be those available from Bill Yates Racing
Service, advertised in Pano. They are available in several weights
(phone for info) and are quite inexpensive.

Lust away.  They really are not as nice as the dunlops, which, IMHO are
almost identical to RE71s, yet a tad less expensive.  They do wear
better though.

These can be had quite inexpensively at swap meets.  On the order of
$3-400 per set, depending on finish, if you really dig.

Looks like you will get your wish.  This week's autoweek says that
porsche is working on a brand new Group C car for (perhaps) the 1993
season.  It also said they might only do the engine and contract
someone like March to do the chassis.

Again, you might get your wish.  This week's autoweek reports that
Porsche will be producing a limited number of street cars based on the
962!  Yow!

Some good news (?),

read an old _On Track_ this weekend.  (Old, being not this weeks.)
and in it was an article on the Porsche Cup they race in Europe.
f(or those of you who don't know, it's factory sponsored fun.)
well, last year they were using 951's.  which they will still use in
Canada (?).

but in Europe, they are using a lightened, tuned carrera 2.
it's 507 lbs lighter, has 270 horsepower, and since the suspension has been
changed, the author said, it wasn't as tail happy as previous 911's.

it has wheels that look like the 959's (they're not), use pirelli slicks,
the heater has been changed (lighter) and no undercoating.  i wish i could
send pictures cause it looks totally BOSS !!!
it also has sideview mirrors like the old moby dicks (Kremer 935 w/ the long
tail).  and it has the standard electric tail, and all inside seating has
been gutted for 1 racing recaro.

they said it costs around $75k to buy to race one.  what i really like
about it is that it is reminiscent of the '73 911RS.  total performance,
not catering to the gold chained, shirt unbuttoned, "guido" type of
poser.  (please, no flames, i'm just trying to create an envision of
the type of guy you'd see in poor b grade movies that we all know buy
expensive cars to impress, not drive.  plus, i myself am a minority.
so i hope i didn't offend anyone.  if i did, i'm sorry.)

i wonder if i could get one to drive here.  just wishful thinking.
plus, i'd have to get a higher paying job, since i haven't even made
$75k in my life yet.

guess, there are drivers on the board still.  thank goodness!!!

there's still hope left,

Yeah, there's a REALLY nice article about it in the current Excellence
magazine. Sounds like Porsche is taking a hard line on making you really
campaign the cars instead of just buying them for the street or for
(god forbid!) an investment. 

And, BTW, they mentioned that they're all sold out, have been for a good
while, and that people are paying BIG BUCKS for places on the waiting list.

And...you have top be an invited competetor to the cup series, and have
to put up a $25K deposit, which is lost if you don't compete in the
races. (Make that 25K DM).  Made 50, 40 for customers, 10 for backup
cars to be retained by the factory.

Why not market this thing....they could charge more for less, like the
911 ClubSport!

Subject: 911SC question

OK, I'm getting a noise that my past experience leads me to believe is
the old chain tensioners going south. I've never done this operation as
a single undertaking, only as part of rebuilding a whole engine. My 
questions:

* can I do it with the engine in the car or should I pull it?

* is my assumption that I should upgrade to the Carrera tensioners
  a good one?

* anything else I should be looking for here?

              I'm interested in purchasing a 1986 vintage 951 and was
              wondering if anyone has any experience with some of
              the 951 chip "kits", particularly those offered by
              Autothority.  
              
              -Are the hp increases as high as claimed ( +30-50hp)
              
              -Can the stock engine handle this increase in power?
               (my guess would be yes since the '88S and 89 only 
               received a larger turbo a revised electronics)

              -Can the rest of the drive line handle the increase,
               particularly the transaxle?  (In the  88S and 89 turbos
               I think 1st and 2nd gears were shot peened and a more
               elaborate trans oil cooler was added from the turbo cup 
               versions.  I've heard that the clutch is a weak link, 
               but a stronger sport version can be swapped.)

              -I've heard that the 1986 turbos had problems with the 
               exhaust manifold.  Can anyone add to this or other 
               problem areas to watch out for (cooling sys???).

              -I know no 944 is known for great off the line 
               performance but is the 951 , because of the taller 
               gearing drop in CR and Autobahn tuning, as bad as some 
               of the auto-rags seem to indicate?  Do the chip kits
               help this??

              -Is there any truth to the rumor that Porsche 
               purposely detuned the 951 so that it wouldn't 
               overshadow the rest of the line-up by offering 
               comparable performance from a derivative of the 
               humble 924??


  Thanks for any help,
     Paul Tacke

Chain tensioners can be replaced without dropping the engine.  Just
remove the muffler and the `engine cover' which is that black peice of
sheet metal that protects the engine bay from the underside.  Everyone
says you should upgrade to the carrera tensioners even if your current
tensioners are still good.  While they are far more reliable than the
old style, they do go bad.  I've seen FIVE go bad (completely
collapse), Bruce Anderson says he's only seen two (making me more
experienced?).  

Other things it could be:

1) The chains.  Once they've stretched, the tensioner is at the limit
of its play and the only fix is to replace the chains.  Check the
travel of the tensioner while it is still in, if it is extended all
the way then your chains need to be replaced and your tensioners are
prbably still good.  But since you have access to them anyway and if
you have he money, it's probably worth it to go to the pressure fed tens.

2) The chain ramps.  These should be checked for wear.  You will find
little bits of plastic in your oil if they have started to break up...
Usually you replace the ramps when you replace the tensioners.

3) Other possibilities are wear on the various sprockets, that might
give added play to the chains.

If you upgrade to the pressure fed tens, make sure you get the
upgraded carrera tensioner kit, it includes some extra brackets that
the old carrera tensoiner kits didn't to prevent the new oil lines
from vibrating too much and wearing holes into them.

Also get the new idler arms, the old ones had a tendancy to snag.

That's all I remember off the top of my head...

Oh, be SURE to put the engine at TDC BEFORE YOU START.  In case the cam
sprocket jumps when you loosen the chains.  Very important.

Subject: re: 914


I have been driving a 1974 914-2.0 for about 10 years, including many
PCA track events, and I have some comments on the suitability of
various modifications.

Wheels:
There are basically two wheel offsets around which have a suitable
bolt pattern. One is the set of wheels which came on the 914,
including 4.5x15 and 5.5x15 steel wheels and all 3 types of 5.5x15
alloys, all of which have the same correct offset. The second
offset is derived from one of the VWs, and is significantly different.
All of the aftermarket wheels which I have seen are in the latter
category, with the exception of the replica 5.5x15 4 bolt Fuchs alloys
(note that many PCA regions will not let you use the repro. Fuchs alloys
on the track). The stock offset wheels will allow up to 205-60x15 tires
over a reasonable range of camber settings with good clearance.
The VW offset wheels are tight even for 185-70x15 tires, although
those can be squeezed in with appropriate camber settings required
in some cases. Stick with stock wheels if you possibly can.

Springs/bars:
The stock 914 has a relatively flexible chassis (even without rust!),
and unless a roll cage is added, it is easy to make the ssupension too
stiff, causing the chassis to assume the role of a suspension by flexing.
I would stick with the front factory bar or a 19 mm H+H bar on the
loosest or second loosest adjustment hole, and stock torsion bars.
In the rear, 140 lb springs without a rear bar or the stock springs
with the factory rear sway bar produce a reasonably balanced car
with the above front setup.  The latter produces better ride on the street.
You can lower the front ride height (with the torsion bar adjusters)
to match the height of a set of stock, sagged rear springs (you really
want the front a little lower: perhaps 1") and have a nice, lowered car.

Shocks:
I used old-fashioned non-gas Koni's with the "collapse it and turn"
adjustment, set about 1/2 turn off full soft. There are also people
(Dennis Thovson in particular) who go very fast with the original
Boge's.

911 suspension updates:
Someone discussed conversion to 5 bolt wheels from a 911, and suggested
redrilling the rear hubs. Don't do it. Many PCA regions will not
accept them for the track. Find the right 914-6 hubs at a swap meet.
The main reason to consider this conversion is better brakes (take
your choice from the 911 assortment, but any vented 911 setup beats
the pants off the stock solid disks).

This reasonably stock suspension setup, combined with a stock fuel-injected
engine, produces a combination which is a better car than almost all drivers
at PCA events. I got mine down to consistent 1:10's and occasional 1:09's
at Lime Rock on A-008s (not "R"s), and the car probably could go faster.
The car is still very reasonable for the street.

From: scholz@osf.org


I've been reading this list with great interest since it's inception.  But
now it's time to ask a stupid question.  I don't own a Porsche, so have
never been an insider and I've not gotten around to buying any books on
the history/story of Porsche cars.

I would like to see a list of all the production street and race cars
Porsche has produced (no too interested in one-offs, now).  But in the
list, all I want is a few important facts.  I'm thinking of a table like
this:

model       internal  years   street/  engine       approx.     
name        model #   avail.   race    type/size    HP/torque
=====================================================================
944          ?        83-86?    S      4cyl/2.3l     ?/?
944S ...
944S2 ...
944Turbo    951? ...
911...
911SC...
911Turbo    930...
... etc ...

What prompted this request recently has been Steve Timmins referral to his
car as a 951 (as far as I've been able to tell, it's a 944 Turbo,
correct?).

Anyway, you can either email any info to me directly, or to the list. 
Either way, I will compile everything and post a summary when the input
dies down.

Thanks,

Okay, so maybe I asked for too much.  What I'd really like is the street
cars produced since about 1965, and really just the internal model numbers
used for them, ala 944T = 951.

I can appreciate you wanting a "simple" table with such info, but the

I have to take issue with this comment.....a 356 is most definitely *not*
a squashed beetle any more than a 911 is. The distinctive shape of the 356 
offers one of the lowest coefficients of drag available in any car of
any era. These cars are the basis for your nice new Porsches..
The recent faddish popularity of the speedster among lawyers is a bummer,
but really, these are classic sports cars. 

You 911 and 944 owners who look down your noses at anything pre '65 are
funny. I suppose you yell at your grandmother for not waxing your 911 
or polishing your gucci loafers right, too. 

Don't get me wrong, the post '65 cars are great, and I'd love a new 944
to toodle to work in every day. But this atttitude about older cars
is ridiculous. I suppose you remember the Beatles as "that band that Paul
McCartney was with before he was in `Wings'"? Geez louise, have a little 
respect for the cars that made your nice new go-fast mobiles possible. 

Okay, so my 356B tops out at 100mph and has a lowly 60HP (DIN). It still
does its thing after 30 years, gets about 30MPG and dusts off the CRXsi 
cars on the mountain roads. And when I park it, I come back to find little
notes that start off "If you ever want to sell this car...." If you ever
drove one, you might think more of them. A car is not the total of its 
0-60 time, top speed, and price tag. 

And the 912 is *not* a "lesser 911" it's a different sort of beastie 
altogether. We've had this talk before.....they're made for different
purposes. There is what I call "old sports car" and "new sports car" 
schools of thought on how they ought to be. "old sports cars" were 
not muscle cars, they were made to be quick with smallish motors, nimble,
inexpensive, and easy for the car ethusiast to maintain. "new sports car"
thought is faster and stickier at any cost and the maintenance and expense
are secondary. And that's Okay, if you decide you want to have a state
of the art sports car and you have the money to fiddle with it. (or have
it fiddled with) But give me a break on this butthead snobbery. 

JZ, proud owner (and not about to sell) of 1961 356B Coupe number 116106,
made by Karosserie Reutter, with a "damen" 1600 Normal motor. Direct
from F. Porsche Jr. to me. (with a couple intervening owners...) 

Have a nice day.

SAY WHAT!?!  These were the _real_ honest to GOD Porsche's if there ever was
such a thing.  Eng. Ferdinand Porsche and his son Ferry Porsche designed these
things and to imply that they are only `squashed beetles' is a gross
miscarriage of justice!

There I feel better now.  Actually these cars started the porsche legend and

There was a great deal of debate that the 911 was not a real Porsche when it
was first introduced.  Funny how things change.
 
>912             lesser 911 (4 cyl)
 
That's why the 1.6 liter 912 was faster than the later smog emission strangled
911Ts, right?  A 912 is not a lesser 911, no more than a 944 is a lesser 928.

Didn't sell well though.  Too close in price to a 911T, too bad for those of
us who would want one.  Great for those who have them!

Several variants.  Originally sold as the Turbo Carrera here, 911 Turbo in
Europe.  Renamed 911 Turbo in 1978 for U.S. consumption.  The name 930 is the

Not necessarily 4 cam.  Many came with the pushrod engine of the 356 `squashed
beetle' line.

Most had the 4 cam 4 cylinder but a few factory cars were equiped with the

Not a 911 engine.  Rebuild one of each and you will find out how different
they really are.  The two engines are very closely related however.  Cams and
various other parts can be interchanged.  Beautiful birdcage type chassis.
long and short tailled versions were available.

911 R    First customer racer of the 911 line.  906 motor.  _Fast_.

Engine was a development of 2 911 engines running flywheel to flywheel (one
running opposite to the other).  All power take off from the middle, sohc but
4 cams driven from the ends.  Many variants, turbos and engine displacements.
Notably, 4.5 l (original), 4.7 l, 5.0 l, 5.4 l, 5.4 l turbo (917-10 Can-Am
car) and 5.4 l turbo + intercooler (917-30 Can-Am car).  BTW, Mark Donohue
drove a 917-30 at Talladega (?) to a record for closed circuit speed that (I
believe) still exists today.  257 mph.  'nuff said.

    Most had the 4 cam 4 cylinder but a few factory cars were equiped with the
    (then) experimental sohc flat 6.

the car was intended to have the flat 6; conversion from a 4 to a 6
is apparently straightforward and this has been done to some cars.

    Engine was a development of 2 911 engines running flywheel to flywheel (one
    running opposite to the other).  All power take off from the middle, sohc but
    4 cams driven from the ends.  Many variants, turbos and engine displacements.

not as weird as it sounds; alfa did something similar to this with the
magnificent 8C2900 engine of the late 1930s.  it is a very viable way to
double your displacement when you're in a hurry to get a competitive
engine ready.

I listed the first ones to jump to mind in my first post.....for a much 
better defense of the species, read anything by Harry Pellow (AKA the Maestro)
	
	in terms of layout, suspension, engine, etc, "squashed beetle" is
	a very accurate description of the 356, is it not??

The same technology and basic design premises were used on both cars. I think,
though that the 356 bears the same relationship to the bug that the 911 
bears to the 356. i.e. they took what they learned and made something 
similar (because it worked) and refined the performance with the best
aspects of the previous venture. Actually, the 912 is the direct descendant,
and uses the best of the 356 motors. The SC Super-90. 

But the similarity ends with design premises. The 356 is a unibody, but it is
materially different in construction from a bug. you can run your finger 
from tip to stern on a 356 and never touch a seam (that isn't totally
butt-welded and smoothed). This makes for a much more rigid chassis than 
you get on a bug. The suspension is by torsion bar and trailing arm, and
this works well. The sway bar design is different and more effective. Like 
most older sports cars, the 356 is softly sprung for a good ride, but allows
little body roll. The track and wheelbase is different than a bug for 
better handling. the 356 wheelbase is 11 inches shorter than a bug, and the
track is about 3" narrower. 

The motor is certainly familiar to those who have dealt with VW motors, and
in fact, you can bolt either motor directly on to either tranny. (the sheet
metal is car specific, however. But the 356 motor uses improved designs for
heads and case and almost every part. Hence, the 356 was getting up to 90
HP while the bug was getting 25-36 HP. Also the oil filter and dual carb
setup is dramatically different while retaining close to the same gas mileage. 
Stock 356 motors came with up to 9.5:1 compression and were quite impressive
for the day. A lot of bang for your buck. 

The driver's perspective though, is totally different between a bug and 
356. I know, I have lots of volksies and a 356. The feel is not that of
an economy car. You feel like the car is much heavier than it is in terms
of ride, but more agile and sure footed than a bug, even a specially prepared
bug like I had until recently...

So they spring from the same stock certainly, but then again, so do all 
Porsches...

some interesting tibits about some race cars.

the 917k was made illegal for the European races.  much like the 959 in
gruppe b.  another story.  so Porsche had to find a racing series for
it.  how about Can-Am in America?  Where the big block chevy mclarens
were dominating.  the Bruce and Denny show.  so the 917k and 917lh
(derivative, which means long tail.  really fast on the mulsanne straight.
i wonder who owns this car now.  probably the factory.) were brought to
America to race.  after racing/development, the 917k (atmospheric, no turbo's
probably the sweetest sound in the world is from a Porsche flat 12.
can't wait till the historics at Laguna Seca.  not that the 12 cyl
ferrari's weren't chopped lettuce, but i like the sound of the 12 cyl
Porsche much better, getting distracted.  but if any one of you get a
chance, just listen.) and were designated 917k/30.  2 turbo's
open cockpit, 1100 hp race trim.  it literally destroyed the series.
People were getting tired of watching Peter Greg winning all the time
so the series lost interest, and died out.  only Porsche has the honor
of ever destroying a series from vastly superior cars.  well winning
all the time anyway.  for those who don't know, it had Sunoco sponsorship,
was a dark blue.  maybe you've seen posters.  the sunoco Porsche (917k/30)
also held the closed track record for the flying mile (???) for the
longest time.  recently (last 5 years ???) was broken.

936.  in 1981 (?) when Peter Schultz took over the reins of Porsche,
he asked what cars the factory was going to take to Le Mans.  The
team said, a couple of 924 turbo's, to see how they do.  other than
that, nothing.  Mr. Schultz said "bullsh*t" (not really).  he
said if Porsche goes to Le Mans, Porsche goes to Le Mans to win.  so they
went to the factory museum, blew the dust of the flat 6 indy motor
from the car that was banned, (they changed rules real fast so Porsche
couldn't race.  scared of domination, like the 917k/30.  instant museum
piece.  kinda of sad to see the march/Porsche motor combination not
working too well.  i gave them 1 year to work out the bugs, then to
start winning consistently, but ....  damn, i'm pissed.  get back into
endurance racing!!!) and put it in a open cockpit 936.  Went to Le Mans
with a single car, and won.

some details are foggy.  if i'm wrong, i apologize.

about the sound of 917k's.  you can hear (doesn't do justice) it in the
movie _Le Mans_ with Steve McQueen, 1971.... "i want Porsche to win
Le Mans..."  great movie for Porsche lovers, but i can't find it on
video anywhere.  any help ????  i want my own copy.  was a box office
flop though.  if anyone has info on getting this movie, let me know
please.  i can't even find it listed in movie guide books and such.
help.

there's a yellow one in the San Francisco area.  saw it in a mag once.
major cosmetic diff:  factore flared fenders, no targa top... steel (?).

the 906 was built buy Butzi Porsche.  (Butzi's his nickname like deal.
Ferdinand is his real name, or at least it starts with an f.)  designed
and built.  until this year (?) he was head of Porsche Design, but now
runs the company.

forgot the 356 cabriolet.  remember that the speedster was built for
"cheap".  or lets say less expensive.  now, they're more desirable.
but just try to buy a 356 cabriolet.

ok, granddad Porsche also worked on the Auto Union.  saw/heard it run
when Laguna Seca honored Porsche as a make back in 83 (?).  i'm terrible
with dates.  one left in the world, but the factory brought it and
ran it.  16 cyls, could fry it's skinny tires in any gear, big

granddad Porsche also designed the original electric motors in the

saw a historic race where i say a 910 out drag a Ferrarri 512LMM to the

forgot 911e, for einspringer (sp ??), injection.  oh, yeah !!! my favorite
911 derivative.  73' 911rs and 74'911rsr.  the rsr was used for the first
iroc series.  306 hp, lightened chassis (like no glove box, roll cage,
oil cooler up front, wild colors,  wish i had one.  twin plug mech. injection.
really cool sound from a revving 911rsr.)

This is true _after_ the first 50 cars that were assembled at Gmund, Austria
and after the prototype 356 that is still in the Porsche Museum.  The first
run of 50 were made from _hand_ beaten aluminum bodies and used 986cc 4
cylinder pushrod engines with 4 speed gearboxes.  These were not as smooth as
the later 356s in body fit or finish, but boy could they go!  I saw one for
sale recently, the owner was asking the absurdly low price of $ 12,000.  wish
I had the cash then...

Definately well balanced in the classical sense.  Adequate power, better
handling than the 911 due to the reduced engine mass overhang and reduced
weight.

The one thing I really miss was the camaradarie of being a Porsche owner.
Always made me feel good to flash my lights at a 911 or a 356 and get a
response.  I once had the opportunity to motor in a group of 5 Porsches on the
San Diego Freeway (including a 924 and a 928).  All very impromptu and
spontaneous, we all happened to be traveling together.  Most of the whiz kid
Porsche owners today don't even realize that you're flashing your lights in
greeting today.  Motorcycles are the same way, still.

A friend of mine (with all the right connections) just got to drive the
prototype.  His impressions were of a very softly sprung vehicle with

No conversion was necessary on the factory cars, they came that way, customer
cars got the more tempermental 4 cam.  I will check on the actual production
figures as to how many came each way.

I heard 6, but my memory fails.  I know Otto Chandler of the Mirror/Times

Actually the 935-78 model had a comparable power output to the 917-30.  A
_*REAL*_ 911.  Talk about too much motor!
 
One statistic that I do recall R&T publishing about their 935 test was that it
went throught the standing start quarter mile in 8.9 seconds and 159 mph (?).
Not bad for a car built _not_ as a drag racer but as an _endurance_ racer.

the 5 liter homologated sports car class was abolished because porsche

Last night was our quarterly local BMW CCA meeting.  Part of the
festivities was the showing of the La Carrera(sp?) Classic video made by
Cunningham BMW/Racing in San Diego.  If you remember, there was a great
article about the race in the Roundel a couple of months ago, and they
mentioned the video.  I think I have also seen ads from Cunningham in the
mag selling the video.

This video is the *COOLEST* 67 minutes of automotive action I've ever
seen.  In brief, the video has some forward comments from Mr. Cunningham,
and the driver and co-pilot in the car that had the camera.  The bulk of
the tape is just the shots from inside the car.  This is just like the
in-car camera shots during F1 races, except the camera is set behind and
between the front seats looking out the windshield.  So, you get to see
and hear everything the driver and co-pilot do.  The car is a stock M6 and
it is f**king amazing!  The co-pilot is the owner of the car and both of
them (I think) are salesmen at the dealership.  It is truly unique to see
and hear the excitement that these two experienced, complete with colorful
language when things just got too wild for polite words.  I highly
recommend buying/renting/finding this video to any car enthusiast,
especially a BMW fan!

BTW, they finished SECOND behind a Testarossa, and the other two
Cunningham entrants (another M6 and an M5) finished 4th and 5th out of 146
entrants total!  Truly impressive from a set of straight stock (except for
tires and wheels, I believe) luxury coupe/sedans.  They hit 173 MPH before
the rev limiter kicked in!!  Several times!

agreed.  it was something like the last 10 or so factory cars that
got the 6 (or the not-very-successful 8); many of the customer cars
switched from the 4 to the 6 during the active racing career of the 904,
as did earlier factory cars with the 4.

    I heard 6, but my memory fails.

_The Porsche Book_ says 11 made; some 5 or 6 in the US.  most kept by
the family, a few sold to friends of the family.  the car was supposed
to be wonderful, but the costing department killed the project.  it got
the most powerful 911 engine of the time.

right; no targa roof on the 916.  also, wild flared fenders for the much
larger tires.

The one thing I really miss was the camaradarie of being a Porsche owner.
Always made me feel good to flash my lights at a 911 or a 356 and get a
response.  I once had the opportunity to motor in a group of 5 Porsches on the
San Diego Freeway (including a 924 and a 928).  All very impromptu and
spontaneous, we all happened to be traveling together.  Most of the whiz kid
Porsche owners today don't even realize that you're flashing your lights in
greeting today.  Motorcycles are the same way, still.

++++++

I know what you mean....other 356ers never fail to flash or wave if they
see you and 912 people do pretty much the same. Aside from  that,
the ratio of people who acknowledge you is directly proportional
to the age of the Porsche. A late model 911 Cabriolet, not a chance. A '66 
911, almost 100%. Sigh. Too many lawyers. 

Motorcycles are that way, yes, but not Harleys. Harley riders usually wave only 
at Harley riders, and never to guys on hyperbikes. Of course, everybody waves
to me on my Triumph. (as they go by at twice my speed... ;^( )

According to Jerry Sloniger in `Porsche: 4 Cam 4 Cylinder Race and Street
Cars'  there were 106 made.  100 for customers and 6 for the factory.  All
were supposed to get the 6 cylinder engine but there were teething
difficulties.  Hence all customer cars got 4 cam 4 cylinder engines.  The
factory cars got converted very shortly there after to the 6.  The following
year a _few_ factory cars got the 8.

The name is Otis Chandler.  My info from an old `VW & Posche' (read that
probably wrong) says 20 cars.  The engine was the 911 S motor with 2.4 liter.
This is one stepp below the state of tune for the 2.2 liter 911 S motor
though, remember that the Carrera had the most powerful engine of the time
plus the extra displacement.  Also one got used for a Targa Florio as a
`pre-runner' for course familiarization.  Also says that after the race
drivers got done with it some of the shock mounts had tore lose.

In the recent discussion of model numbers, specs, etc. there have been
a number of references to certain books. Anybody care to give some short
book reviews and tell where they found these things? 

I have an aftermarket catalogue (Performance Products) which lists some
books: "The Used 911 Story", "Porsche 911 and Derivatives", etc. 
I would rather flip though a book before I bought it, however. 

I've looked in the University library and didn't find anything (not too
surprised) and checked out the big-name chain bookstores (nothing
Porsche specific). Haven't checked the local city libraries, though.
Best thing I found was a Haynes 911 manual at the autoparts store which
I bought to learn more about the car.

Anyway, I'm interested in books on the 911 family ( history, restoration,
specs, etc.) and where I might find them.

Porsche-waving also seems to depend on where you are.  While we lived in
the Colorado mountains, 90/100 (actually more like 9/10) Porsche-drivers
would initiate a handwave or flash.  Here in Boston, it's more like 5/500.

I remember a time I was on a trip through Colorado with a friend.  After
watching me return the waves of several other Porsche-drivers, he finally
asks, "How do you KNOW all of those people here?" [several hours from home] 
It was something I had been taking for granted, so it was a minute or two
before I could stop laughing enough to answer him.

Some would occasionally even beep as we passed to get my attention (like I
wouldn't notice a 91X from a mile off, right!).  This was 6-9 years ago, 
maybe times are a-changing on me (and Porsche).  _MS

The three books you need for restoration are:

The bible, by God (The 911 performance handbook, by Bruce Anderson)
The 911 Guide to purchase and restoration, by ... I forgot.  This is
   for older cars, very helpful.
The Factory parts catalog.  A MUST for any restoration.

optional others are the factory service manual and a haynes or clymer.

only the shadow knows what will happen.  one was white, the other a cobalt

959's are hidden here.

also, there must be more Porsche owners here on the West coast.  how bout

    The Posche Book.  Highly recommended.  Has every serial number and shows when

    though...
 
Jurgen Barth was one of them; he works for Porsche, and has driven for
the factory in the past, and thus had better than usual access to factory
records when he did the book.  there are some glitches and typos, some
of the numbers don't add up, some of the tables are badly formatted, and
the book doesn't really address the fact that the lines between the
356A/B/C models weren't all that clearly drawn; i've seen a couple of
transitional cars that had a mix of some older bits and newer bits (a
friend owned a 356C that still had some 356B pieces in it as it came
from the factory.)

despite the flaws, i doubt that you'll find a better book with the
sort of information that _The Porsche Book_ contains.

it's happening with all the distinctive marques; i've heard
the same thing said about saab, and more recently, alfa.
the new owners don't seem to understand the fellowship.
alfa spider owners don't even know what the closed cars
look like, and just react to light flashing with blank
stares, and i don't know why anyone would even bother
to flash a moron saab driver with `oakley factory pilot'
stickers in their windows.  when in my alfa, i only flash
lights at owners of closed cars and old spiders, and in
one of my saabs, i only flash cars with old `horse collar'
grilles.  they usually appreciate having the owner of a
newer car recognizing them.

i would expect the situation to be very similar for porsches,
with the one problem that with some of the most interesting
old cars being so valuble, that they are more likely to end
up in the hands of someone who doesn't under stand the headlight
flash either (often, they'd be someone you wouldn't want to

As far as I remember, he didn't run Suzuka but Fuji International Speedway
in that video.
Currently Fuji has 2 chicanes after 1st corner (just before 100R corner) and
before the last corner called A corner and B corner respectively. But at the
time Bell ran, there was no chicane. That means the corse was "very high
speed" and "dangerous" course.

But anyway, his driving was amazing. Highly recommended.

Well, the "much larger tires" were actually 185/70HR15s...  :)  The car had
wheel spacers, though, for increased track front and rear.  As far as I
know, the Porsche/Piech families no longer own any 916s; the yellow car
featured in VW&P is Mrs. Piech's original car (with psychedelic interior),
and is, by my latest information, owned by a Mrs. Gotten in the US.  There
were 10 different colours for the 11 cars: the only duplication was a 
VW Silver Metallic, which was on 2 cars.  One of those was made for Gerd
Porsche, and is now owned by Brumos Porsche-Audi in the US.

Incidentally, the 914 4-cylinder was *NOT* *EVER* sold as a Volkswagen.  In
Europe (and likely other markets as well) it was sold as a VW-Porsche, and
at a subset of the VW dealers, but never as a straight Volkswagen.

As most any martial arts student (worth anything) will tell you, the only

Thanks for that word from our favorite sponsor, and now back to the topic at
hand:
 
Does anyone out there know (fact, educated guess, conjecture, opinion, lies)
what the differences are between the Bosch CIS fuel injection used on 911's
between the years of '69 and '73?  I know the cars grew in displacement (2.0
to 2.7 liters) and lost compression ratio (9.8:1 to 8.0:1) during those years.
Maybe Richard Welty can comment on the differences in philosophy and
execution of Alfa's Spica and Porsche's Bosch mechanical fuel injection
systems work?  What about working on such systems, does the nominal
engineering type (read that: so-so on brains and 10 left toes for fingers)
stand a chance working on such systems?
 
Just curious...

I don't have my book here, but I think the CIS was not introduced until '73
(did I misread you?)

I have a '72T and I've got Mechanical.  I think all the E's and S's also
have mechanical up until '73.

There's only a snowball's chance in hell that I'd be able to sucessfully
work on the mechanical pump itself.  I've considered playing with the
mixture but... 

On the other hand, I had a rebuild a few months ago - not cheap.

	Good luck.

Yes, it is. Suzuka is owned by one of Honda's subsidiaries called something
like Honda Land Co. At Suzuka there is an amusement park by the side of the
circuit also run by Honda Land. And when races are not on the course, you
can go around the part of the circuit by a kart (a small one, not for serious
kart race) which you can rent for about a few bucks. (Unfortunately I've
never tried it.)

Major screw-up!  The CIS type of fuel injection was apparently the Bosch
K-Jetronic (a little research goes a long ways here).  The previous system was
a high pressure mechanical fuel injection type and that is the system in
question.  The mechanical system was used in the years '69 to '73, but the '72
- '73 cars suffered some drivability problems (as did the '68 cars) due to
emissions regulations here in the U.S.  Also the 911T for the years '72-'73
had a compression ratio of 7.5:1, not 8.0:1.
 
I did admit to only so-so brains as an engineering type in the previous
posting.
 
Also, does anyone know where I can get my hands on `The Porsche Book'
previously mentioned in other postings?  Classic Motorbooks doesn't list it in
their latest catalog.  How does `Excellence Was Expected' from Karl Ludvigsen

Greetings Porschephiles:

Sorry about the length of this.  This is my initial posting and I
promise to be more restrained in the future.

I am a new (Feb) owner of an '80 911SC Targa.  I'm currently in the
process of bringing the car back to first class condition, and being
new to the whole 911 world I have alot of questions.  Any responses to
these or advice in general would be greatly appreciated.  I'm a pretty
competent mechanic - I've done it a little professionally and I have
engine and manual transmission rebuilds under my belt. These were all
on other types of vehicle however, I have no experience with 911's, or
even much with VW's.  I plan to do all my own maintenance/repairs as I
do with all my cars (in fact, that's half the fun of owning such a
beast in my opinion) but I could use advice on the following matters:

1.  Special problems or known weaknesses to be on the lookout for in
'80's or 911's in general?  I understand the '78 to '80 engine is a
good one and mine in particular seems tight and strong, sounds good and
has good compression.  Any maintenance tips beyond the factory and
Haynes recommendations?  I believe the car has about 60k miles on it
(seems low, who really knows) - how much mileage can I expect before
rebuild with good care?  I'm approaching my first valve adjustment.  Is
it worth it to get a special dial indicator holder (I own a dial
indicator already), are there any other hints for doing a valve
adjustment more easily?

2.  Good sources for parts/supplies that don't cost an arm and a leg?
I'm aware of Tweeks and Performance products and am already on pretty
good terms with my local dealer but am still looking for a more
reasonable source and especially a good stock of quality used pieces.
(I could use door panels for instance).

3.  Driving tips?  I've heard all the horror stories about 911 weight
distribution but so far I've found the handling to be superb.  I've
broken the rear end loose a bit but it seemed quite controllable.  Are
there unexpected things to look out for as I push the envelope more?

4.  I have somewhat of a rough idle, especially when cold.  (Factory
plug wires and tuning helped this alot).  This isn't a big deal, but
I'd like to smooth it out some.  I've been going through the fuel
system components and so far everything checks out.  I have the Bosch
theory and troubleshooting guides but neither they or my Haynes really
address the configuration of my engine precisely.  It's CA spec and I
think someone may have messed with the vacuum hoses and the cat
converters are rodded out (although it passed smog with flying
colors).  Any suggestions?

5.  I get quite a bit of steering vibration on some road surfaces.  I
noticed this in more or less all the 911's I test drove so having
checked the steering train for tightness I didn't really consider it a
problem.  Now, however I'd like to be sure its O.K.  This doesn't have
the signs of being wheel balance or alignment related, I think its just
feedback from certain roads (concrete freeways with pour seams are the
worst) but its fairly high frequency.  Is this as I think just the
nature of the beast or could some problem be indicated?  (Shocks also
seem to be in fine shape).

6.  If I have any complaint with the car, its shifting.  The synchros
could be better probably, but really its just that the length of throw
and effort required seem a little off.  The other used ones I drove
while shopping were as bad or worse - are they like this when new?
What is the consensus on those shift modifying kits that are apparently
supposed to help this.  The linkage really doesn't seem sloppy - would
replacing some bushings help?

7.  I have a really annoying squeak which I think I've traced to the
front right A-arm attachment bushing.  I don't think this is anything
serious but I'd like to just take the attachment bracket apart to
squirt something lubricating in there, can this be detached as easily
as it looks without taking everything else apart too?

I apologize again for the bulk.

Thanks to everyone,

    Major screw-up!  The CIS type of fuel injection was apparently the Bosch
    K-Jetronic (a little research goes a long ways here).

no `apparently' involved; CIS and K-jetronic are essentially the same,
although it's hard to tell from manufacturer's literature sometimes.
CIS/K-jet appeared in the early 70s, and by roughly 1975 had pretty
much displaced the various earlier systems such as Bosch D in the
marketplace.  the K-jetronic version with electronic supplements for
the lambda sensors started showing up in CA cars around 77, and in
50 state cars about 79; some turbocharged 50 state cars got it earlier
(this is `cars' in general, not porsches specifically.)  before the
lambda system was introduced, K-jetronic was entirely mechanical.

Apologies if this is old news...

Retypes without permission from the May 28th issue of MIS WEEK:

  Two of our computer billionaires are having a sticky time with red
tape.  It seems that former prep school pals Bill Gates and Paul
Allen ordered matching limited edition Porsche 959s, worth about
$900,000 each. The machines come with turbochargers, all-wheel
drive and other features that allow them to exceed 200 mph.

  But the Transportation Department is refusing to turn them loose
from storage because the technologically advanced West German
roadsters have not been modified to meet U.S. safety and environmental
laws.  Apparently, the department wants data on how the car would
withstand crashes. No one has been willing to wreck such expensive
cars to generate that data.

I assume that the lambda K-Jetronic is what is known as KE-Jetronic (VW
now actually tells you the injection system instead of just calling it
'CIS').  However, does anyone know anything about...

	- L-Jetronic, as used by BMW
	- KE-Motronic, as used by the new VW 2.0L 16V engine

'splain to me please how damage resistance impacts the environment?
Littering perhaps?

As I remember, emissions are well within specs.

EPA Scum.  Afraid of a car with that kind of potential's what I hear.

What is the Bosch "Digifant" system? This is the term used in the sales literature 
for the most recent Vanagons. It seems this term is used to differentiate it from
the various Jetronic/Motronic systems.

Let me clarify things a little about Bosch Fuel Injection systems.

All Bosch fuel injection system falls under one of two categories,
pulsed, or continuous.  Pulsed injection system inject fuel in
pulses into the intake ports, the duration of pulse determines the
injected fuel quantity.  Continuous injection system inject fuel
continuously into the intake ports, the quantity of fuel delivered
is determined by the fuel pressure to the injectors.

Here are the various Bosch systems and which category they fall under:

Pulsed: D-Jetronic, L-Jetronic, LH-Jetronic, L-Motronic, LH-Motronic
Continuous: K-Jetronic, K-Jetronic w/ lambda, KE-Jetronic, KE-Motronic

All pulsed systems are electronically controlled, since the injector
valves are electrically actuated.  Early pulsed systems have analog
control units, whereas later systems have digital control units.
Virtually all pulsed systems since 1980 have closed-loop OXS system.
The basic L-Jetronic system has a vane-type air flow sensor whereas
the LH-Jetronic has a hot-wire air mass sensor.  The D-Jetronic does
not use an air flow sensor; it uses a manifold pressure sensor instead.
VW's Digifant II system used on some newer cars is a pulsed system
essentially the same as the LH-Motronic system.  Audi's 20-valve
5-cylinder engine as used on the new 90 quattro and Coupe quattro uses
the LH-Motronic system with permanent fault memory and self-diagnosis.

The early continuous systems are purely mechanical, the K-Jetronic w/
lambda has the closed-loop OXS system and has an analog electronic
control unit to augment the mechanical operation.  The KE-Jetronic has
more electronic control over various functions, but is still basically
mechanical.  Some cars with K and KE Jetronic systems have digital
control units.  All continuous systems use a plate-type air flow
sensor.  VW and Audi calls the K-Jetronic systems "CIS", and the
KE-Jetronic system "CIS-E".  The 1988+ Audi 80 has the KE-Motronic
system.

All the systems designated as "Motronic" are more than just
fuel-injection; they are complete engine management systems which also
control ignition spark advance all in one control unit.
