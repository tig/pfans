Subject: Monthly Update

February 1993

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

Well, we survived January. With an OS upgrade, another few hundred
meg of free disk to support the list, and about 40 people joining
the list. If this keeps up, I'm gonna have to move it to a bigger 
computer...

Just back from annual SCCA tech, where we got the EP 914, the ITS 944,
and an ITB Scirroco all approved for another year. My ITA 914 didn't
make this trip as it turned donor car for some parts for the EP 914,
since we exploded an engine in testing at Texas World Speedway over
the weekend. Sigh. Well, there's always tech-at-the-track, and still
have that 356 to work on... It never lets up around here...

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives unless I spool some off of tape (which is unlikely).
Anyway, the newer archives are in much better condition. All in all,
there are about 7 meg of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME. Period. DO NOT FTP between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll
have to take access away. And DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since
it's just too much work. Thank you.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business service where we could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

I still edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region of the PCA, and
still plan to put some of the articles on-line for FTP in 
/pub/pca/newsletters/lone-star. If you edit a newsletter or would like to just i
type in articles from your newsletter, you can upload them into the directory
/pub/pca/newsletters/UPLOAD.

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, join!! 
This info is also on-line in /pub/pca/info, in case you forget to save
this message!

Porsche Club of Americia.
Does take non-US membership.
+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.
Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy, if you own a car.

Porsche Club of Great Britain
Ayton House
West End
Northleach
Gloucestershire
England GL54 3HG
Telephone : +44 451 860792
Fax	    +44 451 860011

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, as some members have discovered,
   you can also reach me by phone (sometimes) at (800) 582-6892.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Subject: Porsche 914 wheels wanted

[I'm not on the Porsche list, this is for a net-less friend.
 Please respond by e-mail to me if you can help, thanks]

A friend of mine is looking for a source for 15x7" alloy wheels
for a '72 Porsche 914. These are 4 lug, 130mm spacing. The offset
is "4 7/8 backside" according to my friend. I believe this is the
same as some years of VW Bugs (SuperBeetle maybe?). Perhaps someone
in England or Germany knows of a source for new wheels or has some
old ones for sale. A place in the US who can drill a set would be
OK too, but all the places he's talked to can't do the 130mm bolt
pattern. At this point he's down to getting a set of steel wheels
widened, but he'd really like a lighter wheel.

Welcome Jennifer!  I'm glad that you hooked up with this
bunch.  There is a wealth of information passing through
british-cars.  There are people here that span the spectrum
from broken-down MG Midgets to 100 point Aston-Martins.
The remarkable thing is that there never seems to be any
difference in the PEOPLE who own the $700 cars and the
$300,000 cars!  It's like everyone has realized that this
motor-sport is about leather, wood and love not practicality,
money and snootiness.  This idea doesn't seem to be unique
to this group but to British car fans in general.

A guy came over to my house a few days ago to look at my
'76 XJS (which was for sale).  He is an ex-member of the
Porsche Club here in Tulsa.  He commented on how much the
British car fans were into the cars and driving where his
Porsche Club members spent most of their time discussing
how much each other charged for this surgury or that
litigation.  For better or worse, we're a different breed.

The only down side to you joining the group is that you will
see where I get most of the ideas for our newsletter
articles!  My secret is out...

Again, welcome.

Rick

PS. I will e-mail you info about my cars.  This group has
seen that junk too many times.

Subject: 914 Electricals

                       914 Electricals
    About a week ago, I posted my travails with water in my 914.  Well, that
seems to have done something to the electrical system (big surprise) which runs
the battery down.  To find out where my juice was leaking out, I put an ammeter
on the connections to the fuses--i.e., remove the fuse, put the ammeter where
the fuse was.  The far-right set was still hot with the ignition off.  That
should be the headlight motor circuit.  If I was reading the meter correctly
(don't put it past me to be wrong, even on a digital one!) the circut was
drawing 250mA, with no key in the ignition and the headlight switch full off.
    My questions:  Is this correct behavior?  (Doesn't sound good to me...) 
Where do the wires go from the fuse box?  Is it just stright out into the front
compartment, then to the motors?  When last I checked, they still raised and
lowered correctly.
    More fun for this weekend!

    ...The battery may also be kaput, but that's a (slightly) different
problem.

In response to the nose-in-the-air anglophiles:
I'd rather own a horse and buggy than a TR6. The reason British
car fans are so into driving is because they don't get much of
a chance to do it. But the cars do make attractive garage decor
while you're searching for a new fuse panel.

Now, back to our regularly scheduled discussion; I've got a
patient in for a routine uncination for a opacified 
nasopharynx infundibulum. Any suggestions on what I should
charge? Keep in mind I'm scheduled for vacation next week...

OK, I'll take a swing at a response, although I don't know how to
get the message back to the original poster.

I can only speak directly for the Jersey Shore region of the PCA,
which is a small region of about 200 members on the books, perhaps
20-25 of them relatively active. However, from my interactions over
20+ years with other PCA regions in the Northeast US, I believe we
are in some ways representative.

In many ways I see the same focus on the cars and driving them,
regardless of the particular model Porsche driven, that the British
car group sees. The dominant focus of our region seems to be track
driving through the PCA drivers education program, as well as various
aspects of maintenance and repairs. I believe that the larger PCA
regions in the NE have similar groups with these interests, but they
have groups who are more into concourse's or rallying as well. In
any case, the overarching connection I see in PCA is love of the
marque and what it represents. The members who drive stock, tired
914's (I was one of them for quite a while) seem to be fully as welcome
as the drivers of the megabucks cars. We haven't discussed either
surgery or litigation (other than who got the last speeding ticket,
and what they are doing about it) for as long as I can remember.
In fact, the typical discussion of lawyers follows the usual
deragatory comments typical of engineers and other technical people
(of which I am also one, as are many of the members of our region).
I don't know much about the PCA regions in Arizona, but it sounds
like the person in the original article may have been a non-participating
member (we have a lot of them) who was guessing at what actually
happens in the club.

This sounds about right for relay coil current.  Can you pull the 
headlamp motor relay, and check if the current goes to 0?  250 mA is 
way too much quiescent current on a shut-off car.

Harumph!  Sorry about the late email reply, I was at my broker's...

Charge your usual rate, so he gets a nosebleed.  Then send him to me, 
so I can charge him to fix the nose.

Ouch....I own a TR-6.  This will probably get me kicked off the Porschephiles
list but a few years ago it came down to selling my 914 or the TR-6.
I sold the 914.

One thing I'd like to note is that I had a guy from Germany offer me
$10K for my TR-6.  I didn't sell it to him but he told me that 
Triumphs, Morgans, and Jags are very popular in Germany and that
an importer could make a lot of money importing American british cars
to Germany.

Yeah, I agree 100% with what Frank wrote.  Actually, in reading the
original posting, you could replace the British cars references with
Porsche references, and vice versa, and it would read just as credibly!

It's really too bad when someone has a negative experience with a car club,
because clubs are all fundamentally enthusiast organizations always on
the hunt for fellow crazies.  The "gold chainers," to my experience, never
form the core of any club, probably because it just isn't their style!
Too busy smearing exotic Zymol on baby (or having someone else do it) to
organize a rally or autocross or charity auction or...  Alas, I know from
my tenure as membership chair a few years ago that some small number of

Thanks for the answers several folks provided.  The modification turned
out to be both desirable and straightforward, and I made it this evening.
The surge tank is a small metal box with four ball valves on three
sides, held in place by the foam blocks which fill the rest of the bladder.
The fuel pick-up and return hoses run from the cell's top plate to the
tank.

I moved the surge tank to another side, the rear end of the cell as
installed.  This was simply a matter of disassembling the cell, relocating
one of the hoses to the surge tank so that it reached the top plate in the
tank's new location, then repacking the surge tank in its new location.
A couple of slices to the foam blocks to get everything to fit were all that
was necessary.

  I own a british car and a Porsche 911.  My british car Mini-Cooper S is 
quite reliable and just as fun to drive as the Porsche in a different way.

I can see how the writer of the other message could have gotten disgusted.
Here in Chicago Region, there is a lot of emphasis on driving and track events.
But some regions may stray closer to polishers than drivers...some our

    bug, however. I had a few coupes, and even had a '55 Speedster for a
    couple years. My last Porsche was a '67 911S. (I will admit with pride
    bursting the buttons off my shirt that I have never owned a water-cooled
    Porsche.)  Old porsches used to be fun to drive, work on, and talk
    about. I never remember overhearing conversations about surgery or
    litigation at any of the 356 Registry get-togethers.  Perhaps I wasn't
    listening. Even in the mid-70's, the 356 Registry folks were a different
    breed than the Porsche Club of America types. I always felt the 356
    Registry gang was more into scraped knuckles than country clubs.

    Regardless of how snooty it appears to the porschephiles that the brit
    car bunch is, the fact of the matter is, most Porsche owners (NOT most
    people on the porschephiles mailing list) seem to be into the cars more
    for the status than the fun. Speculation ran rampant through the old
    Porsche hobby in the last 10-15 years, completely destroying it for
    those of us without surgery or litigation to pad our wallets. The local
    dealer that sells most of the old Porsches around here (NOT the
    PCNA-sanctioned Porsche dealer - you're lucky to find an air-cooled
    Porsche there, and never for less than about 70K) had a couple 356
    cabriolets last summer.  Both were nice cars. They were asking 32K for
    the A, and 35K for the C. (Do you take kids as trade-ins? Sheee-aaa,
    right!) I can afford the TR-250 I now have, both to work on and drive. I
    will probably never be able to afford another Speedster, even though,
    truth be known, I'd rather have an old Porsche than an old Triumph most
    days of the week.

    Sorry to be so cynical. That's the way I see the hobby (err, business).

    I hear the next Porsche goldmine will be 356 coupes. Stand back so you
    don't get run over by any lawyers or surgeons...

Subject: Club 924; my nightmares for this month

Does anyone subscribe to the Club 924 newsletter?  I called Automobile Atlanta
for some stuff, and they mentioned that for $20, I could become a member. It
is supposed to be run by the same guy who runs the 914 letter...

My nightmares for the past month are probably due to the fact that my '77 924 has become a daily driver, and that the car is now ungaraged.

In the past month:

 - muffler hanger went (replaced)
 - muffler bolts came undone; started the car one morning, and it woke the
neighborhood (tightened bolts)
 - car stalled out in a turn (seems that duct to the intake manifold came 
loose; 2 minute fix)
 - glove compartment lock broke (used latch ordered)
 - heater switch control to defroster heater, seems to have locked in one place
(probably a broken clip or wire)
 - left side rear running light is intermittent (will light when car door slams,
probably just a loose connection)
 - radiator/hose connection under thermo switch began to leak (new clamp, OK)
 - left headlight on the blink; fuse box clip won't seem to hold the fuse 
tightly...

Admittedly, all minor.  But I feel like my car has turned into Han Solo's 
Millenium Falcon, at least as far as reliability is concerned.  So this
weekend, I pull the console to fix the heater problem (probably a broken
wire or loose clip), and take care of all these sundries.  Any hints for 
pulling the center console?   BTW, does anybody find that cars of this age
squeak a helluva lot more in the cold (20 F) weather?  

I also hope to make a full list of parts from that wrecked 924 
I mentioned a few days back, and send the list to anyone who requests it.

Happy motoring.

I'm contemplating purchasing a pair of 16x8 alloys for the rear of

drive the car hard on the street and plan to autocross again someday.

Good news is they're only $200 for the pair.

Subject: 944 Power steering pump



  Several weeks ago as I was changing the oil in my '86 944, I noticed some seepage
my power steering pump. That seepage turned into a leak, so I decided to find the source.
I put the front wheels on solid ramps, turned the wheels to lock (held by my trusty
assistant's hand -read "my better half") for highest pump pressure, started the engine,
and watched as a steady stream of fluid emerged from the seam between the two halves
of the pump housing. After removing and disassembling the pump I found a couple of rubber 
seals that had hardened. One was an O-ring, the other kind-of dumb-bell shaped.
  I thought that I would be able to pick up a couple of seals and put the pump back 
together, but with my luck that was not the case. After talking with my local parts guy,
I learned that the pump runs at a high temperature and subsequent disassembly allows the
pump surfaces to warp. This requires milling the pump surfaces as a part of the rebuild
process in order to get the pump housing to reseal even with new rubber; thus the reason
for the availablilty of rebuilt pumps with a core charge, but no seal kits available for 
purchase.

Can anyone confirm the pump housing warping due to high operating temperatures?
The pump housing appears to be aluminum and is rated for 110 bar (~1600 psi) which is 
pretty high pressure so I see the need for very flat mating surfaces, but I didn't think 
that aluminum would warp that much.

same here.  i had a '69 Triumph GT6+ and a '72 MGB.  i never drove
further than i would walk back with them.  my 912 has been far more
reliable than either british car.

on the triumph, i experienced, on the road, far from home:

 - broken shift linkage

 - broken u-joint

 - sucked exhaust valve (you know the rest)

 - burned out alternator (300 mi. from home at NIGHT, NV desert)

 - wheel fell off, almost (came real loose, probably my fault).


on the contrary, the worst my '69 912 has done is:

 - threw a fan belt - i had a spare AND the wrench  :-)

 - spark plug wire came loose.

...both daily drivers.

Yes, I can confirm that, as I have experienced the *exact*

at full lock. My solution was to replace the pump with a 
new unit instead of trying to rebuild it.

It is sad to be so misperceived by folks who have not spent enough time

them membership prior to spending the big bucks on a porsche, we will
be better viewed by the "general public." I can certainly attest to the
fact that I have never heard surgery or litigation, or billable hours
subjects pre-empt genuine porsche conversation at ANY pca event I have
attended.  PCA has been an exceptional diversion from just such

Tony, did you disassemble it hot or cold?  Regardless, the story sounds
like horse doodoo to me.  I cannot think of any other part in a car which
absolutely has to be milled just because it has been disassembled.  I
suspect the real issue for you will be whether the rebuild parts are
available in the US, individually or in a kit.  I would suggest two
possible strategies:

1. Call another parts guy.  I can (and have) recommended Mack Mackenzie
at Clair Parts Express, 1-800-354-5100, located in Dedham MA.

2. Shoot me some mail at my office address, kevin%beyond@mcimail.com,

How about a cylinder head?  There are certainly precedents for mandatory

I really don't know anything about the power steering on a 944 (not

Hi everyone,

While on the subject of water leaks on targas, I have the following
problem with air leak from around the door area on a S body.

When going above 50 MPH, some air starts leaking in from around the 
door area.  When I put a piece of paper between the door and the
seal and then shut the door, the seal seems to keep the paper
pretty tight.  Now, there is a secondary piece of seal that was
added to later cars which mine doesn't have.  Could that be it?
Could air be getting behind the main seal (since it is not glued to
the frame) and then into the cabin?

Any pointers?

As for British cars, I see most of them in the backyards with the
body rusted really bad, which tells me they have been abandoned.

Thanks,

I can easily tell how a driver of a Porsche feels about Porsches.
When I'm in mine and see another another Porsche I wave or flash

No flames, but maybe a Neutron bomb would be more appropriate...
Nukes the offender but doesn't mess up their car!  ;-).

To answer your question...
What ELSE!!!  Reliability and nearly 40 years of technical 

innovation (and, of course, weight).  The knowledge that it's
YOUR car from the start.  I felt guilty about buying my RS
at first, though I got over it after a couple of seconds.  

Everybody that I've let drive it so far has come away with
a big shi*t-eating grins on their faces, especially my dad.  


I immensely enjoy driving my cars and never pass up the chance to
stop and talk to other Porsche owners about their cars, or give them
a flash of the lights on the interstate. My wife doesn't get it, but 

I don't get that clothes shopping thing.  


For good or bad, there will always be those who will waste an exquisite 

piece of machinery to use it solely for driveway jewelry. The only 

upside to this is that someone has to buy the cars new and eat the
initial depreciation.

It's a real nasty job, though you can do it with some creative thinking 
and the right tools.  (this is obvious, since a mechanic can do it!).  
I surveyed the mounts before trying it, and wisely chose to let my 
mechanic hassle with it - you need to move the engine or drop the

I did it on my 87 944S. I would assume that a 951 would be roughly
similar, assuming that the 951 exhaust system didn't introduce 
complications. Using a trick suggested by one of the mechanics at the
local dealership, I removed the bolts holding the cross brace to the
frame only on the side I was doing the mount on, then lifted the
engine a few inches (with a small sissors jack) and pried the cross
brace down a bit. This combination provided enough clearance to
remove and replace the mount. My recollection is that I needed to
use some odd wrenches (other than a standard box or combination) to
get to some of the bolts, due to clearance problems, but I don't
remember the details. The whole job took a few hours.

I only replaced the right mount (so far), but I see no reason that
the left wouldn't work the same way.

Overall, I would say that the the job falls in the "advanced amateur"
category. I wouldn't try it as a novice backyard mechanic, but you
don't need to be a professional either.

A few weeks ago, I was driving my '84 944, when it suddenly died
(while doing 30 mph) I was able to turn over the engine,
but it stalled at the next stop light.  A few attempts to get it
going failed, with the car starting, sitting at 1000 rpm for 1/2 a
second, then stalling agin. A cursory look over didn't reveal anything
out of the ordinary, and the cold/lack of my tools forced me to get
a tow.  The repair shop called the next morning reporting that there was no 
problem, it started fine for them.  Since then, I have been using
gas "w/ engine cleaners" and dumping the occasional fuel injector cleaner
into the tank, and the problem has not been seen.  A friend who
"knows everything" mentioned that Porsche fuel pumps are known to
have problems, and recommends putting in a new one.  Has anyone
seen this problem and/or knows the reliability of 944 fuel pumps.
I am, of course, hoping it was bad gas, or some such...

Hi there!

I had the exact same problem on my car (Porsche 944 '86).
The local Porsche dealer checked the car for 5 hours 
without being able to trace the problem.
Assuming that it was my previous garagist who sabotaged
my car, I looked for something easy to sabotage and 
related to the fuel injection system.

There is a relay in the fuse box 
called a DME. It monitors the fuel injection output.
The intermitent nature of the problem 
is a strong indication that the DME is malfunctioning.

So, I changed the DME and never had a problem since (6 months).
I also changed my mechanic and my biggest problems since have been
to decide what tires to buy, and what brand of synthetic 
oil to use. Go figure!!

Kevin,
  Sorry for the long delay. I did disassemble the unit cold, which would seem to me
to pose less of a threat of warpage, but by the time a got this message I had already 
bought a rebuilt pump (by ZF North America?) I did get a competitive price with what 
Clair Parts Express offered. I also asked Mack, when I spoke with him today, if a 
seal/rebuild kit was offered. He indicated that there was not, so there might be some 
credibility to the need for 'remanufacturing' the pump as opposed to just cleaning it 
and replacing seals. Next time I do anything to my 944 I'll be sure and consult the 
collective knowledge of the porschephile list BEFORE spending my hard earned dollar.

Thanks for the help, though.

What happens if the entire cross brace is removed? 

I may have to replace the oil pan seal in my '86 944 and don't see how I could get the 
pan off without removing the brace entirely (aside from pulling the engine). Or does the
brace swing far enough out of the way to get the pan off? Has anyone done this?

My own experience includes one of those great moments that are never
forgotten. In the first long drive I undertook in my 944 7 years ago
I came over a crest and entered a fairly deep gully.  Another 944
did the same on the other side and we head down each side of the hill
to cross over at exactly the bottom of the little valley.  Naturally
we waived and smiled (and even grinned) at each other in that instant.
The whole sequence lasted maybe 30 sec to one minute but was beautiful.
There were no other cars, the day was perfect and I thought that *this*
is what it was all about in terms of the fraternity - sharing a special
driving experience.

Since then I have waived a number of times and for less than 10% I would get
back a waive.  928s are almost a waste of time, 911s look down at you
(a 944 dares to waive at me!) and other 944 drivers rarely.  924 drivers
have a look of shock at the idea that a more expensive Porsche would
actually acknowledge them.

Yes, I confirmed the same thing last night.  I can think of more
convincing reasons for the kit's inavailability, to wit:

 1. insufficient sales volume to merit carrying it, or
 2. PCNA would rather keep the work to themselves.

I really don't think, nor does my mechanic, that there is anything very
clever about the pumps making their repair difficult.  But who knows

Intermittant DME relay failures can indeed be the source of such a problem,
and they can be a real pain to track down if the problem is not too
repeatable.  They are not, however, the only possible cause of this kind
of problem.

Anecdote time: for all of use who periodically bemoan Porsche prices.
About a week ago, there was a Testarossa in the shop I frequent.  It wasn't
running well, and had what ultimately turned out to be two electrical
gremlins.  One was the DME relay, which is in this car a pretty simple
device except for the addition of a blade-style fuse on top and a big ol'
diode inside.  The diode was bad.

Oddly enough, the relay had a 928 part number on it, and I think I remember
seeing a Porsche parts emblem.  So Jerry, the owner, called up his dealer
parts guy and gives him the number.  Nope, not a valid part number.
Strange.  The parts guy calls Reno, and finds out that, yeah, it is
available but there are none in stock in the US (probably a Euro part).
It'll take some time to get, and will cost $60.  Sixty bucks for a stupid
relay?!?!

Jerry called up a local Ferrari dealer, less because of the price than
because he wanted to get the car done.  Sure, we got it.  $160.

Btw, the car's owner will be moving back to Turkey in a few months and
cannot take it along because of import taxes.  He'll probably let the car
go to the first $65K.  Any takers?

I think the acid test, though, is what do the other Porsche drivers
do when you're broken down on the side of the road.  When the 931
stranded me (actually it was my fault - improperly seated rotor) on 
a local street last August and I was trying to push it uphill into
a legal parking space, I found myself hoping that a fellow Porsche

I was not amused.  The silver lining, I suppose, is that I have

Tony, I too, have a 931. Implication: I *frequently* need to push it into
a parking spot. ;^)

Up here in the Great White North, Porsches are pretty rare, so the odds of
another Porsche passing by to offer help are pretty slim. The other side
of that is that volunteers come from out of the woodwork to help Porsche_push
whenever I need it, just because it IS a Porsche ;^)

Since one good turn deserves another, a 931-er will always stop to help a
motorist in need, even when they drive an unidentifiable "American" made
jobby :^)   Right, Kelvin?  ;-)
ALL the other Porsche drivers wave and/or flash the lights when we meet
up here. As a matter of fact, Ferraris, and even Brit car drivers acknowledge
Porsches and smile knowingly up here.
Upshot: I've never met a jerk driving a Porsche, but I have met a lot of really
great Porsche folks, so I am truly suspicious of anyone's claims to the
contrary.
So keep the faith. The vast majority of Porsche enthusiasts are a pretty neat
bunch who have been known to travel as far as from Australia, or California
to Canada, to meet fellow Porsche nuts :^)
So who knows? Maybe there are even some nice folks out there driving
Brit cars  ;^)

This could really be anything in the ignition / electric system.  Yes, 
it could be the fuel pump but it doesn't sound like it - in my 
experience, they often whine before they die, and their death is sudden 
and complete (no 9 lives stuff here!).

I'd look more towards a bad socket connection on the DME relay, wiring 
harness connectors, and fuel pump itself.  Also, do you have an alarm 
that cuts the ignition?  I recently got stuck for 1 hour in Boston when 
the alarm decided to sliently trigger, cutting my fuel pump circuit.  I 
solved the problem by grabbing a screwdriver, opening the passenger 
footwell cover, and yanking the relay coil wire!

Subject: Sudden Loss of Power

I used to have an '85 944 and am familiar with a recurring
loss of power situation. It may not be the same as the reported situation, but 
maybe it is ....

About 6 times over the years the car was going great and it simply DIED.
It might start again, but if it did, it bounced, burped, and hardly would
stay alive. The next day it was always fine.

Needless to say, this was troubling and perplexing.

I really racked my brains trying to find a common element linking 
together the situations, and I finally did figure it out:
In each case it was VERRRRYY  COLD. (Jonathan Hodapp did say it was cold
when he had his problem.)

I think the gas line was freezing up, so I was always sure to use dry gas
in the winter, and I never had the problem again. (My newer 944S2
has never done this, btw.)

PS: The last time this happened in the 944 I was able to keep the engine 
somewhat alive -- even though it bunked like a bronco -- and I didn't
put it in gear for about 20 minutes. Since I wasn't moving, the air under the 
hood warmed up, and the freezing condition went away. I drove home
without incident.

So,  maybe this is the cause.

If cold outside temperature is the key to the problem, I would first
look at injector o-rings, manifold gasket, and other sources of vacuum
leaks which would seal up with a warm engine.  Had exactly this problem
last winter, I think.

You'll have more fuel problems in the winter than summer due to moisture
from condensation.  But in my experience they do not cure themselves with
engine temp.  Very immediate experience, 'cause I'm working my way through
some mediocre fuel right now!  I would not use "dry gas," which is alcohol,
preventitively, rather only when a problem arose and then really as a last
resort.  I do not remember the litany of woes attached to introducing
alcohol to our poor cars, but it is my impression that you really want to
avoid it where possible.

Glad to hear I'm not the only person driving a Porsche in the winter!

This would make the car very difficult to start, but would not cause 
spontaneous shut-down, which was the original complaint.  A small 
vacuum leak also makes idling improbable, but at high RPM the leak % of 
total air volume is so small, that it doesn't affect the engine much - 
just a slight leaning (of course, the 924/944 engines already lean - 
about 18-22 degrees if memory serves me!).

This is my understanding too.  BTW, don't waste your money on "Dry 
Gas".  By isopropyl alcohol instead (same thing, but 1/10 the cost at 
your drug store).  Are there any chemists out there who can comment on 
isopropyl vs. methanol vs. ethanol in our fuel systems?  I think 
isoprop. isn't quite the terror that the others are.

I'd argue that it's better to run 1 or 2 Dry Gas bottle-equivalent 
units (to coin a new unit) per winter to insure moisture doesn't build 
up in the tank.  It's better to have the water in solution and flushed, 
than to sit and build up, where one day it runs to the injectors and 
really nails you.

Subject: 914 Q's


Hi there, 

First of all, Stan, I am about to maybe get four 914's, in various
conditions. Only one of them, I think is worth having, and it's a 
1974 914-4 2.0.

Second, the 2.0 has a bad carb.. It is a sign carb. setup. I would 
like to run a full carb. setup, so I could use any info as well as 
, I mean as well on carb. and cam setup for the track.
Since my carb. is bad I am also in the search of any alternative
to get my/hopefull car started. 

Thirdly, the car has a substancial amount of rust around the battery
tray, is it possible to just cut the whole piece out, and weld in a 
new one. 

I know the answers to the above questions may seem simple, but a
 porsche expert, I am not. I hope I didn't offend anyone, I'm
new at this sort of thing..

Thanks in advance..

Well Greg, having 4 914's certainly will qualify you as being a
total masochist but welcome to the fun. As far a just replacing
the battery tray, keep in mind things are not always as they
appear at first site. You must thouroughly check out the entire
passenger's side suspension console area to make sure it is solid
and salvagable. Also remove the outer rocker panel, it comes
off very easily, and make sure that the metal behind there
is not completely rotten. Often a rotted battery tray is an 
indication that battery acid may have done more damage below
the tray.
Luckily there are repair parts for all of these areas but you'll
need a welder to put them in. 

If it is only the battery tray then the repair is easy. The
tray and the support are two separate pieces and they are
around $40 for both. You would weld the support in first followed
by the tray on top. Any welding shop can do this in about 1/2 hour
if you prepare the site by grinding away the old rust and preping
the surface of the new parts by removing the paint from the 
welding area.

I don't know for sure what happens if the brace is completely removed.
However, since the inner pivots for the A-arms mount to it, you probably
introduce the possibility of a small change in wheel alignment (camber
only, I believe) if both ends of the brace are loosened or removed.
The magnitude of the change would depend on the clearances allowed for 
the bolts. I also don't know if you have to remove the brace completely
to remove the oil pan. If you have to remove it completely (rather than
disconnecting both sides and lowering it by several inches), you would
presumably need to disconnect the connections between the A-arms and
the brace, which would offer another opportunity for alignment
ambiguity on reassembly.

Well the day is about to come. My 1990 Gold 944S2 Cab that my
father bought me for graduation in florida is coming home to 
cleveland in one month. I have gone into withdrawl since I left
her 6 weeks ago. We also have an '88 951 but she's gonna be sold
soon so I'm not driving her. She was my first that I ever drove.
I will always have a special spot in my heart for that whopping
265 bhp. I remember one fine moment on the local I-90 when I saw
a guy and his mighty fine girldfriend in a new '93 RX-7. Still
had its temp tags. With my friend in the car, I pulled up next
to him. I taunted him a bit and he was ready to go. @65 mph the
car was spooled already and off we went. He kept up ok but I
was starting to pull away around 90 mph. You should have seen
his girlfriends fact when two teenagers were nuking her boyfriends
new car. The guys face read: "I should have known that I should
have bought a Porsche!" I never forget the red beast. (Neither
will 4 police officers who caught my dad once).

Back to the topic at hand. Our insurance company said that they
would not insure us anymore. Mostly because a bus hit me while
driving the 951 and did 14k of damage. In Ohio a state school bus
is responsible (he got a reckless driving ticket) but doesn't
have to pay the damages. When my dad told them he bought the
S2 and put it in my name that said that at least I should get
a different insurer. Is that PCA insurance company good?

Quite right to point this out.  I didn't mean to insult anyone on this
list, which by definition shows a commitment to the marque beyond the
display of social status.  Indeed, my second wave (funny how one remembers

However, as a generality, I suspect my story of waves has some validity,

Carefule try to roll/rub off as much of the foam as you can, or lightly
scrape it with an x-acto knife.  Then use a product called
"Goop-Off"(most hardware stores should have it) to remove the rest of
the crud.  Goop off is phemonenal stuff, but wear heavy gloves (I use
neoprene ones).  You should see how latex gloves absorb that stuff and

Drew,
	When I worked at a tire shop years ago, we removed the tape
with an extra wheel weight.  The lead wheel weight is soft and won't 
scratch the alloy.   Use the wheel weight as a scraping device after 
soaking it with solvent.  Do this gently however cause the clear coating
can get grey streakes from the lead.  I don't remember the solvent
but I would guess that bug/tar remover ,sold at auto stores,
might do the trick.  I just tried this a couple of weeks ago on 911
16" wheels using carburetor cleaner.  It worked well but don't use
carburetor cleaner on painted cookie cutters or you'll probably damage 
the clearcoat!

I have a 1987 911 Carrera with the following symptoms:

	1) Interior lights don't go off when door is closed, unless manually
	   switched to off position.
	2) Power windows don't function after ignition key is turned off
	   but prior to opening the door. Normally this allows you to close
	   the windows after key is removed, but prior to exiting the auto.
	3) UNGO Box alarm system does not respond to door opening after
	   being set. Alarm Armed LED does not indicate "on". Alarm installed
	   at time of purchase by local dealer. 

I believe that these are all related as they all ceased normal operation
at, or about the same time. (I didn't really notice them all at once but
as the functions were used I noticed their absence and put it all together.)
I have examined the schematic and find several points at which these systems
come together, but it is pretty obscure as to which relay or module is the
culprit.
Anyone out there seen this before? Any educated guesses?

I checked the obvious stuff, like the door switches, etc. The interior lights
turn on manually, in the door operation position they are "ON", and obviously
"OFF" in the off position.
The Porsche Service Dept here has no idea, and will trouble shoot at their
standard labor rate, but there has to be a better way.

	I don't know about the window lift function as my '83 doesn't have
that, but I did install an Ungo Box, including using the dome light
circuit for the door entry alarm.

	The door switchs turn on the light by supplying a ground path. 
Either the "professional" installer left an uninsulated connection
or disturbed things such that the ground path is supplied other than
through the door switches; or the Ungo Box itself is defective, supplying
the ground path.  The latter is easily checked by removing the strip
connector from the Ungo Box.  If the lights then work correctly, the
problem is with the Box, if they still malfunction, it's in the wiring,
which yuou can trace.  The "professional" probably used an easy access to
the circuit.  You Ungo manual shoes which wire is actuated by the doors..

	It's a good idea to install these things yourself as a) you know
how it was done, and b) you |CARE.

	 I wal;ked into the back of a "professional" installation facility
a while back just in time to observe an installer, who was sitting
on the floor surrounded by tangled wires, turn the air blue with

Well, at the risk of being more obnoxious than usual, I would suggest
you look first at your Ungo box.  Ie, utterly disconnect the thing, and
see whether the problems go away.

It is extremely common for stereo/alarm installers to splice into the
first red wire they see.  (Even worse, they often use those knife-edge
splice connectors which slice and weaken the wire.)  I can't tell you
how many times I've seen Porsches in the shop with any of a multitude
of electrical gremlins for this kind of reason.

Sorry, I don't mean to insult you if you indeed did the work yourself,
or if my suspicions really do not point to the root cause!  There is
plenty of extra capacity in the form of unused circuits, especially in
cars with the new-style Central Electric Box (85 1/2-forward 944, 928S4,
Carrera-2 and -4).  You just have to take the time to find them and
wire things right.

I would just use whatever "wax & silicone remover"-type solvent is
closest to hand, such as BASF Pre-Kleeno, Prepsol, or PPG Acryli Clean.
BASF also makes a more aggressive solvent specifically for adhesives, but
I have yet to need it and so have never tried it.  Or brake cleaner.

The PCA insurance program has been in place over a year now and I have only

amounts of money in the premiums. I have heard nothing about claims service.
Remember, the Porsche cannot be your primary car (i.e. no coverage if you
drive it to work--not even occasionally) and I think that if you have had
more than one ticket you are SOL.

I used a short piece of clothesline to keep the shock compressed (tied
a loop on each end), then once the shock was installed on the hood,
slipped loop off of the piston. 

Of course, this assumes that the shock is compressed when you start --
if you've already let it out, you'll have to recompress it and then tie
it up.  But at least you only have to compress it once -- you don't have
to keep trying to compress it while you're trying to fit it to the
hood...

        The *best* stuff I've ever used is 3M Adhesive Remover. 3M should
know, they are the ones that make the sticky goo anyway. A bit of advice
however, don't wait too long to remove the stuff off your rims because the
longer you wait, the harder it is to get off. The 3M stuff works great when
you are removing old rubber trim, door seals etc.

If these are anything like the 911 trunk struts (and I suspect they are) here
is the trick I used:

Use a pair of plastic tie wraps in a double long loop to make the strut a bit
shorter.  The wraps are thin enough that you should be able to attach the
strut to both ends without having to remove them.  Once installed, snip the
plastic wraps and remove them.

still have your GTI?), I would advise at this point to go with the original
FI. This is especially true if you want to run the car in the entry level
classes, where they might not allow a non-stock configuration (I know
nothing about the rules, so I'm just assuming, ie making an ass of ...
mostly me). It's a major pain in the forementioned ass to synchronise a 
double carb setup, you'll have trouble pasing emission if you set it for
the track, it'll be kinda wimpy if you set it to pass emissions, and
it's not very easy to change setups. Granted that a stock FI injection
setup is not easy to change either (ha!), but I think it's a good
compromise.

Now if compromise is not your goal, and they allow such modifications, you
might want to look at installing an aftermarket FI (Stan should be able to
give you more info). But this is a whole 'nother issue. You know the
trouble we had with the Electromotive FI on the SAE car. A set of Webers is
not cheap and might end up costing the same (I think Solexes are cheaper,
as in less expensive, but I recommend Weber from my own experience, since
mine haven't lost their sync in a long long time).

* Lotsa rust around the battery tray could indicate lotsa rust in other
places, too. This is for two reasons: 1. it could be an indication of the
weather and storage conditions for the whole car, and 2. the battery acid
leaks down and corrodes almost anything it touches. Check the rocker
panels, remove the targa top and see if the doors close properly, check all
the suspension components under the battery (passenger side), remove the
carpets and check the floors where they meet the central backbone of the
chassis. I'm sorry to tell you all this if you've already done it, but it
never hurts to check.

I hope this helps. There are quite a few knowledgeable 914 owners on the
P-list, so I'm sure you'll get lots of good advice. From what you told me,
you've got a good deal on it. Congratualtions again!

The only trick I can suggest is to put them in the freezer for a while.
That'll make for a little less internal pressure and when combined with
those one handed transmission presses you been doing :*)  you'll be able
to compress the struts an inch or so and put them in. That's the trick I
used along with holding the hood up with my head!

Just mounted new Goodyear GS-C's.  The Dunlop's being replaced were
worn on the inside edges front and back and below the wear bars in back.  

Any first hand experience out there with GS-C's on a 911SC?  
Pressures and street alignment setup?

I drive approx 100 miles a day over a twisty coastal mountain pass at
speeds ranging from 15 to 55+ depending on the commute traffic and am
looking for tire longevity rather than the hottest autocross setup.

I think the last front end job set the toe at 0 or very slightly negative
which probably explains the inside edge wear on the fronts.

So far the GS-C's seem too responsive, I keep having to take steering
input out after entering the turn.  Just not use to them as yet I'm
sure, and they have only about 250 miles on them as yet.

I'll probably set it up pretty neutral, and use 27psi F, 29psi R until
I can chalk the edges and check it some commute.

Thanks,

It's not so much the tires as it is alignment and tire pressure.
(there are some exceptions)

If your car is lowered, most are, you are probably stuck with too much
negative camber in the rear.  I've had even wear using about 3/4 to 1
degree of negative camber but with full tire pressure.  Generally, to 
get max tire wear, use max tire pressure.  This is what works for me
and has worked for dozens of customers when I worked at the suspension
shop.

Setting the toe to 0 should have practically no affect on inner tire wear.
I've been using 0 toe set and about 1/2 to 3/4 degree negative camber
in the front and again had flat tire wear.  Since there is less weight
on the fronts you don't have to go with max tire pressure.  32PSI  has worked
well for me.

Have you put rack spacers in the car yet?  There is nothing like that
annoying "bump steer" on 911's.  The spacers help.

My comments reflect owning 5 911's over the years and having worked for 
a suspension shop and having done alignments on variety of vehicles, many
of them Porsches.
They are however opinions and not absolutes.

ALL U.S. spec 914/4s came with EFI. Carb versions were only available 
in Europe, but there was a "factory update" carb kit that let you put
Solex 40PII's on to satisfy SCCA rules for Production racing back in
the early '70s.

If you want to run in any nearly-stock class, you need the EFI. Having
carbs moves you from Stock to Street Prepared in SCCA autox, from ITA
to E Production in SCCA road racing. The only place it doesn't hurt you
is in PCA autox events covered by the PCRs.

And yes, carb tuning is a major pain in the ass. Our EP road racer has
carbs, and just getting it set right for the temp/altitude/air density/
kind of gas/day of week/phase of moon/etc on a race-to-race basis is
really, really hard. Trying to go from streetable to trackable is just
simply insane. The EFI does a much better job of compensating for those
wide extremes.

Aftermarket EFI is available, but expensive. And hard to program. I've had
a new aftermarket system in development for about 9 months now, and it's
still going to be expensive, but should be better than most of the others.
I've used Haltech, Electromotive, MoTeC, and CompTech, and all have their
problems. Maybe I can avoid at least the most painful of those... In the
meantime, though, I'd go back to the stock EFI.

This is, however, where you'll run into problems. If you're *REALLY* lucky
you can buy everything you need to do this for $500 or so. If you are
even *MORE* unlucky, it's max cost is about $3200, which is in the same
league as the aftermarket systems. And you still have to debug it and
fix whatever minor problem caused it to be pulled in the first place (hint:
air leaks and bad wiring harness connections are usually it).

>* Lotsa rust around the battery tray could indicate lotsa rust in other
>places, too. 

Amen to everything said here. There are *NO* rust free 914s, except maybe
Kyle's but he cut all the rust off and started over nearly from scratch  8{).
Having a really rusty 914 can be a majorly bad deal though, as the car
basicly has nearly no resale value until it's fixed, which usually costs
more than the car is worth if it didn't have the problem...

Agreed! Congrats, and welcome to the proud, the few, the foolhardy -- the
914 Owners!! BTW, let me take this opportunity to plug the 914 Owners
Association. You should join this group of about 1600 other midengine
manics by sending a note to 914 Owners Association, Suite 116, 100 South

I tend to agree, but have hit some of the exceptions in the past. I use
Yoko AVS Intermediates for street, BFG R1s for autox and time trials
(different compounds). No 'skatorbacks' here...

Sounds about right. But sort of bypasses a key point: the car won't
align right, or ride right, if it's not at the right height. Get as
the ride height adjusted *BEFORE* you get the car aligned. And if you're
serious, you'll set the ride height, then corner balance the car (which
will screw up the nice ride height you just adjusted) then align the car --
then check the corner balance again! It can be a really painful process
to get it "just right" -- then the first good-sized pot hole you hit blows
all your adjustments! So, I recommend for street cars just set the ride
height and do the alignment. 

Now, what to use for the "specs". Answer: get the SPEC BOOK for your car
from Porsche. For example, for the 78-81 911SC and Turbo 3.0 (book number
WKD-422720) you find the rear specs on p. 80, and the front specs on p. 73.
Note that there are several specs given -- 911SC; 911SC - USA,Canada,Japan;
Turbo; Turbo -- USA,Canada,Japan. The "911SC" are the *European* specs,
which is what the car chassis was designed for. However, if you have a US
car, and lower it to Euro specs, you have to remove the spacer washer at
the top of the front struts or you'll live to regret it. [aside: no, I
won't post the spec book. You really need one, they're $10 at the dealer or 
most aftermarket suppliers like Automotion, so go buy one!]

For autox, you may want to lower the car even more, but if you drive it
at all on the street, I don't recommend it.

>Setting the toe to 0 should have practically no affect on inner tire wear.

But you get a lot of front weight transfer under braking, and if you're
turning in under braking, you'll notice that *A LOT*.

FYI, on pressure I find that 34 front and 38 rear is what I need to use
for autox, and what I typically use for the street as well. Road race/
time trial is, well, different.

	Surely the issue here is not that Bob got his Porsche as a present
(I centainly wouldn't turn one down :-) ), but that he doesn't have the
first idea how to use it.

	Public streets are designed to get a lot of people from A to B in
as safe and efficient a way as possible. If you can have fun doing so (by
driving a well engineered, capable car), so much the better.

	Equally, race tracks are designed to allow those who want to race
to do their thing (again in a reasonably safe and well controlled
environment).

	Racing other cars on the street is stupid. It is irresponsible. It
is dangerous. It brings no kudos on the ranks of Porsche owners. And
(fortunately) it seems to be something which *very* few people on this
list indulge in.

	In the UK we have a number of advanced driving organisations (the
Institute Of Advanced Motorists (IAM), Royal Society for the Prevention Of
Accidents (RoSPA), Guild of Experienced Drivers, etc). To join most of
these organisations involves passing an advanced driving test, and to wear
their badge is done with pride. Are there equivalent organisation in the
US (and other countries where the list goes)?

	Sorry to get on my moral high horse, but using your Porsche to
"taunt" other cars on the street is NOT A GOOD THING!!

Not quite.  But I got an earful from my wife when she returned from her
annual sojourn to Europe last summer.  Seems one of the neighbours told
her some babe in a silver RX-7 had been frequenting my house during her
absence.  It was in fact fellow Porschephile list member Nicos K., who
had brought his 931 around several times for pre-track tech'ing.  Oh,

Yah, the common element in all this is sensing if the door's open, 
which is determined from the door switch.  This switch, if it's like my 
951, grounds a circuit when the door is open.  From your description, 
it appears the circuit is always grounded.

Check *both* door switches - one of them is probably grounding.  Pull 
the wires out of the hole, so they don't touch anything, and see if the 
problem goes away.

If that doesn't do the trick, then you've got a short circuit to ground 
slightly upstream of the door switches.  Pull your meter out and start probing!

Autothority was the first source of 951 chips, and has lots of 
experience.  I have no information about Automotion, and have not heard 
of anyone using them.  Those facts would make me prefer Autothority.

Correct, you should absolutely not drill the cycling valve!  This 
removes all computer control of the boost and some detonation 
protection!  The car is not as driveable this way, either.  I drilled 
my valve years ago and then blew $90 to get a new one.

Shimming the wastgate isn't necessary.  That alters the boost curve, 
which you can do by adjusting the orifice size in the cycling valve 
(i.e., put a small valve in the line between the pipe behind the air 
filter and the cycling valve).  The maximum boost is determined by the 
turbocharger design and how the wastegate's controlled, not by 
wastegate shimming.

No.  In the USA, automobiles are considered appliances (toaster,

Subject: how to (try to) avoid the CHP ...


	Dear speed freaks,
	
	I thought you all might find this an interesting speeding tip
	from the land of Porsches and convertibles...


	CARRERA ALL THE WAY...




A friend sent me this very interesting info :

	1) The CHP budgets for an annual income of $500M from traffic fines.
		Last year they only collected $250M.  This year they must 
		collect $750M or there will be huge budget cuts (layoffs).
		They will be giving LOTS more tickets.

	2) The CHP offices post officer's ticketing statistics semi-monthly.
		Thus, it's been observed that 89% of all tickets given have 
		fallen on the 15th and 30-31st of the month.  These are 
		dangerous days to drive!

	3) On a 4-lane highway, CHP ticket distributions are as follows:
		Lane 4 (slow lane):	20%
		Lane 3:			 3%
		Lane 2:			 2%
		Lane 1 (fast lane):	75%

	4) As of Jan 1 (a month ago), it's okay to ticket you if your car
		has not completely LEFT an intersection before the light
		turns red (before, you just needed to ENTER the intersection)
		We'll see how enforcible this is...

Note that (2) and (3) are very powerful arguments to drive in lane 2 and 3,
and to not break any traffic rules on the 15th, 30th, and 31st of every
month :-)

	   Now I'm looking for detailed info of which year of 944's had what
   features, which years are "better", what to look out for, etc. I've
[stuff deleted..]

I like the 85 1/2 and later 944's because they have a nicer
interior and updated suspension. You can get a good value on
these cars. Of course turbos are great and fast so go for that
if your budget allows. The following options apply to both
turbo and non-turbo models for 85 1/2 on. 
Look for the following options:
1. Leather seats or sport seats. Identify sport seats by the
large side bolsters. I think this option is rare????
2. Limited slip differential. Very rare. You'll have to scan the
WPO number (VIN) and decipher it to find out if this car has it 
short of crawling underneath. 
3. Sport Suspension. Upgraded wheels, shocks, springs, bars. On the
non-turbo you get Fuchs or phone dials in 7"x16" front and 8x16" rear.
Turbo sport suspension gives *huge* 8,9x16. 
4. Electric door locks-  nice-to-have
5.Rear wiper - another nice-to-have

Almost everything else is standard.

In '87 you also get many updates including oil cooler seals, engine
mounts and timing belt tensioner.

Please correct me on any errors/omissions porschephiles. This would
make a great FAQ answer/list for people interested in pre-purchase
944 questions.

Subject: Re: Dry Sump 944?

       Never done a 944 engine, but drysumps are all pretty standard. The only
real problem I see you having to face is where to drive the multi-stage pump
from. As a general rule you want the pump to turn 1/2 the speed of your motor,
so on sprint car motors (Chevy & Ford V8's) we drive them off the front of the
cam (attached directly to the cam gear). Or on my midget motor (SOHC Ford) we
use a cogged tooth belt and pully system hung off the front of the crankshaft.
The dry sump pully is twice the size of the crank pulley (2:1 ratio). Other than
buying a used dry sump pump, we made everything else. Buying a used dry sump 
pump is really not a wise idea unless you've got some experience with these
things. 99% of the time I've observed that the people who are selling the used
pumps are doing so because they've exploded an engine (thus the pump has 
swallowed a lot of metal). Taking the pump apart is not that big of a deal if
you've got patience, and make sure you put it back together exactly the way
you took it apart (includung the gear polarity). The only real critical    
clearance that you have to adhere to is the siphon/pressure stage from the
oil reservoir to the oil inlet. The scavange stages aren't as critical and
can usually just be cleaned up. In any case, it's not too expensive to replace
a single stage from the pump (as opposed to the whole thing) should the need
arise.
        If your any good at welding (or know someone who is) it's not that tough
to modify a stock pan to change the pan depth, put in windage assembly, and add
the siphon pickups. Not everyone does this, but I also add a siphon pickup to
the valve covers in order to keep the oil from over filling the cylinder heads.
I not only maintain a high volume flow, but we try to keep about 100 psi going
through the motor at 9500 rpm (in the midget motor), this motor doesn't seem to
like anything less. 

         If you've would like any further elaborations, or have any questions
just drop me a line....

(It's also very warm to the touch - that's what I noticed first.)
The unit has no other symptoms, so I'm wondering if it's just the
nearness of the heating ducts, or the general lack of ventilation 
around the box.  Since I only use the stereo once per month, I don't
have the opportunity to experiment with it.  This was never a problem
with the 931, since the heater was nowhere near as warm!

I would have thought on recent model Porsches it wouldn't be a problem
since the fuel cutoff will save the engine anyway.  Going into the

I don't recollect that being the case with my Alfa Romeo 1300 Spider
Veloce, with about a 7000 RPM red line, but it may well be true for other
"small Italian cars".

The engine clearly wears faster when operated at 7000 RPM than at
3000 RPM.  Having said that, Porsche engines will withstand a great deal
of time at or near the red line. I (and many others) drive our cars
at PCA track events, where the cars spend significant periods (9/10
of the time on each lap, four 15-20 minute sessions per day) at full
throttle, between 5000 and 7000 RPM. Many cars have literally thousands
of miles on them under these conditions. So broadly, buzz it right
up there anytime the engine is warm and you can find any plausible
excuse to do so.

To determine the optimum shift points, find a plot of the torque
curve versus RPM for your engine. For each gear, multiply the torque
by the gear ratio, and also use the gear ratio to convert RPM to MPH.
Now plot rear wheel torque (neglecting losses) versus MPH. There will
be 5 different lines on the plot, for the rear wheel torque versus
speed in each of the 5 gears. In virtually all of the cars I have
done this for (including my 87 944S 16 valve), the torque at the
rear wheels at the red line in the lower gear is still higher than
the torque in the next higher gear. Assuming that is the case for
your car, shift at the red line. Otherwise, shift (for that gear
change) at the place where the lines cross (i.e. where the rear wheel
torque will be higher in the higher gear than the lower).

I decided that there was likely to be enough interest in this to
send it to the list, dispite your suggestion to use email.

Rare on cars bought from the showroom, yeah.  You won't get the

Depends on the year.  87-forward have the dish style forged rims.  Sport
shocks most easily recognized by their yellow colour.

They actually played games year-to-year with the level of "standard
options."  I think the drill was to introduce a model with few standard
options to keep the base price down, then throw in more options the
next year as standard, for whatever reasons.

My experience as well, and not too surprising since we drive the same
car.  The nasty thing is that the AutoThority chip extends the red line,
and one really cannot be too sure that running above what the factory
deems a safe max is indeed healthy.  I have found the extended range
very useful at NHIS, just because of the speeds you carry at particular
points on the track.  But I decided to stop availing myself of the
extra rev's because of risk.  (And try to focus on carrying more speed
in the first place, so that I really have to be in the next gear!)

I think one part of the original question which hasn't been answered
is whether banging the rev limiter is itself to be avoided.  I really
don't know for sure whether repeatedly running up against it is likely
to accelerate wear and tear.  It sure doesn't do much for my driving
style, of course.

I don't have the chip in my car, so I still have the original red line
(6840 RPM, if I recall). On the tracks I drive most frequently (Lime
Rock and Watkins' Glen), there are a number of places where the car
just reaches red line on short straights, where I either need to
back off just before the red line, let the car do it itself by hitting
the rev limiter, or do an upshift followed by an immediate downshift.
Being lazy, I usually just let the car hit the rev limiter. So far,
this doesn't seem to have done any damage. I would sure like to hear
from anyone who has a different experience. By the way, I don't find 
that letting it hit the limiter messes up my driving style, but I
am expecting it to happen, so that may be part of it.

I'm Autothority chipping my 944S2. This chip raises the redline. (It is 6200
on the vanilla engine. I haven't run it up high enough to trigger the

Subject: 911 floor pan replacement

Well, after 6 months of rockers, patches, door jams, hinge posts,
and trailing arm replacement kits, I'm finally ready to replace
the floor pan.

I have the 3 piece kit - pedal area, and basic floor in two parts.
My plan is to use my floor jack and put the car up on four ramps, using
the tires/suspension to suspend the car.  I thought of using my jack stands,
but, its tough to get the car reasonably level.  I cant afford/dont want to
make a stand or anything fancy.

Soo, any tricks to removing the pan?  My current thoughts is to just
use my cut-off saw and cut it out - roughly.  Then, go back and carefully
remove the pan edge/weld points.  Clean up the surface and weld away!
Believe me I know that it sounds easy, but, we're taking major hours here.
Practically all the metal on both sides have been replaced since the
rockers/trailing arm metal is all new.

I'm not trying for a perfect restoration, if I was, I've already
failed that by using repro-metal and not all patches are butt-welded.
Basically, I'm after a tight, damn nice 912.

Ideas??  Caveats??

Subject: Re:: Danger beyond red line?

     How is the rev limit of an engine established?  Seems to me
it depends on the design limits of many small pieces and factors:

 -    Design strength of reciprocating parts
 -    Valve float (spring stiffness, came shape, etc.)
 -    Cam timing  (resistance of cam chain to inertial forces
retarding the cam timing)
 -    Heat dissapation (related to internal oil flow)
 -    Ability to control fuel/air mixture at high flow rates

     The list goes on - -

     We used to play with racing V-6 Jeeps.  They responded
nicely to headers and 4 barrels, but valve float became a
problem.  No damage, but you could tell when there was no more to
be had.  Solution?  Put washers under the vlave springs to
stiffen them.  Gain another 5-700 RPM.  But guess what?
Occasionally a valve keeper would fail, causing the obvious
damage.  Of course in a Jeep the shade tree repair bill was $100
or so instead of a few thousand.

     Two things are obvious.  Porsche engines are excellent in
tolerating what most would consider abuse, however the laws of
physics havn't been repealed.  Stresses  increase exponentially
with RPM.  The more time spent over red line, the more wear and
fatigue on some unknown weak link in a particular engine.

     Anyone know how the factory establishes their red line?  It
may be based on emissions, for all we know.  This IS California

Engines these days are built to much better tolerances than the older

but I suspect that they are built to the same or even better standards
than many of the Japanese pocket rockets.  I friend of mine who used
to race superbikes beats the stuffings out of his Toyota twin cam GTS
routinely.  He is constantly revving it to 8000+ rpm's and trips the
rev limiter at about 9000.  This car has 80K mi's and still runs well
with no leaks or nocking noises.  I used to feel guilty redlining on the

All I can say is if you feel guilty than don't redline it.

My experience bears out what others on this thread have said.  I have 
another item to add.

The 951 motor is known to eat it's #2 big-end bearing after roughly 
50-75 hours of track usage.  The lesson here is that yes, the engine is 
strong and can take high revs, etc., but you cannot forget maintenance. 
 Bearings *do* wear, especially at high revs, and must be replaced 
periodically lest you grenade the engine.

Subject: Hydraulic clutch in 914?

Hey everyone,
Excuse me if I make some internet faux pas -- this is my first note to
the mailing list...

Anyway, I have a 1974 914 1.8L that has some serious clutch cable problems.
The metal tube that guides the clutch cable down the center tunnel has 
come loose -- starting with the welds up front but eventually the weld to
the firewall pulled loose! The whole tube could slide in and out.  My 
father and I sort of kludged an attachment to the firewall and I put in a
spacer block just ahead of the shifter.  This has lasted for over 2 years,
but now the clutch pedal keeps dropping lower and lower until I have to 
put it to the floor to disengage.  If I tighten the cable at the rear, the
pedal comes up but soon starts dropping again.  I am really sick of this
problem (the rest of the car works pretty darned good) and want to end it
once and for all.  Since I don't really want to hack up the center tunnel 
trying to re weld in the supports, and since hydraulic clutches seem like
a much more robust and adjustable item, I am thinking about making the
switch.

Since it seems that there are quite a few 914 owners on the list, I figured
I would solicit advice. Has anyone tried this mod? What pedal/master cylinder
combo did you use?  Are there other cars with floor pivoting clutch pedals
that might be cannabalized for such a switch?  I was thinking I could use
a pedal unit designed for off-road vehicles/ sandrails (my VW upbringing
is showing) but the only ones that I have seen are entire units.  I just
want the clutch unit.  Does anyone make a kit for this conversion?
Thanks for any help or recommednations.

As I understand it, the primary weld, and the one which breaks first, is
the weld joining the tube to the firewall where the cable enters the
engine compartment. It is primarily this weld which absorbs all of the
reactive force on the cable jacket (which is essentially equal to the
force on the cable itself). When this weld breaks or weakens, the
reactive forces are transferred to the (weaker) welds holding the
tube laterally in the tunnel. I would seriously consider a careful
rewelding job of the tube to the bulkhead, and just use screw mounted
cable clamps elsewhere in the tunnel. that may also require some
refabrication of the area around the tube. I think you can get to the area
to be welded from the engine compartment. You may need to remove the
engine. In any case, I would expect this to be easier than engineering
and fabricating a hydraulic clutch setup. I would also expect that
Porsche body shops with 914 experience would have done some of these
before, and would know how to do it relatively efficiently, if you
are willing to pay someone to do it (I know that is against the code
of this group).

>fwk@hogpa.att.com

Both of the the 914's I owned experienced this same problem.  The first
time it happened, I though for sure it was the pressure plate.  The tube
sticks out of the firewall about 2" and when the weld breaks, you loose
that 2".

What I did to fix the first one, was to fabricate a fairly thick piece of
sheet metal which was roughly 3" x 4".  It was oddly shaped, however, to
fit around heater cables and or fuel lines that protrude through the
firewall near the clutch cable.  (I made a template out of cardboard first).
This piece of sheet metal fit over the hole where the original cable tube
had been.  I then drilled a hole in the middle of this sheet metal and
had a short piece of tubing welded into place to extend 2" out the back
and about an inch in front.  I then drilled four small holes (one in each
corner) to accommodate sheet metal screws.  I simply screwed the sheet metal
into place over the old hole.  I wanted to avoid a torch anywhere near
that area because of fuel lines.  I then used screw-mounted cable clamps
(with a rubber sleeve) to hold down the original tube in the tunnel.  I
made sure the old tube somewhat fit into the new tube (the 1").  It worked
like a charm.

The next 914 (a real beater) had this problem when I bought it.  The way
the previous owner solved the problem was to add several washers and
spacers to the clutch end of the cable to take-up the slack.  He just 
let the nipple end of the cable jacket butt-up to the firewall itself (it
didn't fit into the tube hole at first).  Eventually, the hole wore bigger
and bigger but because the nipple is tapered, it never would come completely
through the firewall.  But the clutch pedal would go lower and lower, and
get spongier and spongier.  So, instead of sheet metal and cutting and
welding, I did the greatest hack:  I took a 1" thick piece of oak, cut
it to the size to fit over the hole in the firewall (similar to the 
sheet-metal size and shape I did on the first one).  I then drilled a hole
in the middle for the clutch cable and then made about a 1" round counter-
sink hole about 1/8" deep so that the nipple end of the clutch cable
would have something to fit into.  I the cut a small slit from on side to
the hole in the middle.  I loosened the clutch cable, slipped the piece of
wood over the cable (through the slit), tightened up the cable, and it 
worked quite well.  A 1" thick piece of oak doesn't flex.  But what a
hack!!

Hope this helps.

Sound a little dubious to me, too.  Wire doesn't fail because it goes

The tunnel normally gets hot after a while, because the exhaust is in 
there.  It's especially bad if you're not moving fast constantly (heat 
soak).  Also, the heater floor outlets and ducting are just 
behind/above the radio, so you'll notice more heat-soaking in the 
winter due to that.

This problem can definately be solved without removing the engine
working from the bottom of the car as Frank suggests. I agree its
not worth the trouble to do a hydraulic conversion just to avoid
this repair. It's quite common. My brother was on a long road trip
in Canada with his 914 when this happened to him. He took it to
a non-Porsche mechanic who had a welder handy and the welded fixed the
whole thing beautifully for $50. What a deal!

I know almost nothing about 914's except that a) they are real Porsches,

As to the question of clutch tube problems, there was a pretty good

>>
To determine the optimum shift points, find a plot of the torque

by the gear ratio, and also use the gear ratio to convert RPM to MPH.
Now plot rear wheel torque (neglecting losses) versus MPH. There will
be 5 different lines on the plot, for the rear wheel torque versus
speed in each of the 5 gears. In virtually all of the cars I have
done this for (including my 87 944S 16 valve), the torque at the
rear wheels at the red line in the lower gear is still higher than
the torque in the next higher gear. Assuming that is the case for
your car, shift at the red line. Otherwise, shift (for that gear
change) at the place where the lines cross (i.e. where the rear wheel
torque will be higher in the higher gear than the lower).
<<

An easier method is to see when the power output in the lower gear
(past the power peak) equals the power output in the higher gear.
This is because power is proportional to torque times engine speed,
and avoids having to scale up the torque curves. Also, if the
ratio in engine speeds of the redline to the speed where the power
matches that at redline is closer than any gap between adjacent
gears, then shifting at redline is optimal.

Growing up in England, I heard a lot of garbage like "shift so that
the speed in the higher gear is the torque peak." Actually, the
torque peak is rather insignificant, despite the play given to it
in the press. The reason is that the torque peak is usually rather
ill defined, with a fairly broad flat area with almost random bumps on it.
A better measure is something like "150 lb.ft. are available from 2000 rpm
to 6000 rpm" or "80% of the maximum torque is ... ," which you
sometimes see.

I may have to make a decision on Zenith vs Webers for my 1970 911T.
The right side (from the rear) Zenith is acting up-approx *no* fuel
getting to #5 and #6 cylinders, which results in a very poor running
car!

I have the car at a shop where the folks seem pretty knowledgable about
the carbs and are first going to try to repair the bad carb.  Option number
2 is to rebuild it, number 3 to buy a good used, number 4 to repalce
with Webers.  Any recommendations?

My understanding the that the main benefit of converting to Webers is
availability and experience, as not as many folks know how to work with
the Zeniths.  This shop tells me that properly adjusted Zeniths offer 
the same performance and economy as the Webers.

I kind of would like to keep the Zeniths because they are "original", and
at this time, my most econocial fix.

BTW, anybody got a nice gold 911T emblem for my engine cover?  I'll buy
it or trade for the 911S that is currently on the car.  It appears that
the previous owner only got as far as a new emblem in his desire for a

Subject: 911 Zeniths vs Webers

Six cylinder Zenith (40TIN) vs. Weber (40IDA type) carbs.

My experience has been limited to 69 911T Webers and 70T Zeniths.

If you are not seeing fuel on two cylinders, check the float-needle
supplying the cylinders.  On the Zeniths and Webers there are four
needle-float assemblies, so on a 6 cylinder setup, 2 cylinders have
their own individual float chambers and the remaining 4 cylinders are
supplied by two chambers, with two cylinders per chamber.  You may have a
clogged mesh filter leading to the needle, a float that is stuck holding
the needle up, or a clogged needle.  Sometimes the stock needle has
been replaced with USA made "Grose" jets.  I was told that these jets
can stick and cause a chamber to run dry.

Both Zenith and Weber 911 carburators are actually simple 6 X one barrel 
assemblies.

The main disadvantages of the Zeniths are

  1. Very expensive replacement parts.  Ask the dealer for the price of
     an idle mixture screw.  Years ago I was quoted >$20US.  Parts are only
     available from the dealer.  Gasket sets are available aftermarket.

  2. Some replacement parts are not available.  If your throttle shafts are
     worn, you might consider fitting oversize throttle shafts. Weber supplies
     0.5MM oversize throttle shafts for the 40IDA, for Zeniths you will have
     to make your own.  

     At least one shop, Eurometrix, (Campbell,CA?) machines their own oversize
     shafts for the Zeniths.

  3. The overrun circuit on the USA Zeniths can develop air-leaks and cause 
     an excessively lean idle mixture.

  4. The Zeniths have little flexibility with respect to different jets and
     Venturis.  The stock 70/71T came with a 27mm Venturi and the 
     72/73 Euro T used a 28.5mm, but that is it as far as I know.

  5. The Zenith has a complicated accelerator pump mechanism that can stick.
     However, the mechanism is flexible in allowing each cylinder's pump volume
     to be adjusted separately.  

I would not worry about keeping the carburators original, it is a simple 
job to swap the Zeniths for Webers and vice-versa.  So if you decide to 
replace the Zeniths with Webers, you can always stash the Zeniths in your
garage with the rest of your "spare" parts. The same float gauge works 
for both Zeniths and Webers.  The manifolds and the air cleaner assembly are
the same.  To swap them back you will need 6 manifold gaskets, 2 carb top
to air cleaner housing gaskets and 6 air horn gaskets.  The manifold gaskets
and air horn gaskets can be used with either carburator.

Worn Zeniths are priced at swap meets at $30-$50 for a pair.
Fitting them with oversize throttle shafts/throttle plates is >$300, so
worn carburators are not worth much.   New Webers sell for $900.

Note, Webers were factory stock for some 71 911T's so you can use factory
jetting specifications if so inclined.  Look in the 69-71T spec book for
this information.

Subject: Need help/ideas on selling 83 928S

I am the owner of an 83 928S that's for sale, and has been for some
time.  I'm looking for help on how to sell it (or maybe even a buyer!
Anyone interested?)

Here's the full scoop on the car:
New clutch, timing belt, alternator, water pump
Runs great, generally in good condition.
Some signs of wear on driver's seat where you slide in/out
Plastic dash has 2 cracks, each about .010 wide by 6" long
Small ding on lower passenger door
Burgundy paint, brown/tan interior
~140k miles
Synchros are wearing but still work.  Probably need replacing in 1-2
years, depending on driving style.
Known problems with the car:
	Electric antenna stuck down
	Passenger door lock isn't keyed to the rest of the car
	Temp control is on or off; usually interior temperature can be
	controlled by setting the fan or re-directing the vents
	Display on Alpine aftermarket am/fm/cass is almost gone

So the car's not flawless, but generally in good shape, and the known
flaws are minor (with exception of synchros).  Overall not bad for a
10-year-old car.

There you have a core dump on everything I know about the car.  I
started advertising high ($13,000) and have been dropping the price as
low as $9950, but still no avail.  The problem is generally getting
people to see the car.  Only had six calls on it in 4 months of
steady advertising and two who were interested in buying it
but didn't (for reasons unrelated to the car).

I'm advertising in the Portland Oregonian regularly.  Ads in other
pubs haven't generated a single call.

When people call, if they're not put off by the mileage then they're
generally pretty interested.  but my problem is that nobody calls!

So my questions:
What can I do to generate more interest?  
What price range do you feel is appropriate?
How do I get people to call?

Since this topic is of general interest, I'll post a summary.

Thanks

Subject: '74 911 master cylinder upgrade, etc.

1. We're upgrading the original 19 mm master cylinder in a '74 911.  We have
installed 930 ("turbo") brakes all 'round, and need something that can
move a greater volume of fluid.  We have started by installing a
Mercedes Benz 23 mm cylinder, but I am unhappy with it for a number of
reasons.  One reason, and a problem with other possibilities, is clearance
between the cylinder, the steel cross member (it's a '74), and the steering
rack.

Has anyone done this sort of upgrade (dumb question) to a car of this
year?  Is there a good source of size-to-spec master cylinders?  Are
the manufacturers like Tilton, Kelsey-Hayes, AP Lockheed approachable
for one-off applications?

Another problem we have with the M-B part is the angle that one of the front
circuit lines leaves the cylinder: basically downward.  I am not happy to
have a loop of steel line hanging down from the car, albeit protected
by a steel belly pan.  I would be happier to see a banjo fitting making
a right angle.

Trouble is finding 10 mm brake line banjo fittings.  Rumor has it, from
sources we've tried, that we will end up ultimately ditching the metric
stuff and going with AN-sized fittings and compatible parts.  True?

Which sort of brings me to...

2. Anyone know of a dynamite source for reasonably priced metric plumbing
fittings?  Seems we have to scrounge high and low, then pay through the
nose for them.  Unless, of course, we can find the fitting as a standard
car part; then all we have to do is pay through the nose!

Thanks.

You can use the dual 23mm master cylinder setup from the 954 (911SC RS), 
or the 934 or 935 with very little effort. There is a fellow in Crosby, TX,
at Kraftwerk Engineering who sells these setups for a pretty reasonable
price. Well, ok -- they're repros of the factory stuff. Let's see -- 
this month he's advertising a four wheel set of Wilwood Superlite IIIs
with calipers, rotors, pads, lines and 23 mm master cylinder from $995.
And the 23mm *single* master cylinder for $159. Mike Hallock at (713)
328-5923.

He also has custom trick coil-over parts and a whole bunch of other go-fast
goodies. But be warned -- he is a *strange* individual. Reliable, honest --
just strange...

You can also engineer a dual remote mount master cylinder with a "hanging"
(as opposed to mounted-to-the-floor) pedal, but that usually also means
a hydraulic clutch too. On the whole, if you don't use something like
the factory used, it's probably the next best setup. You can use "stock car"
parts, which greatly reduces the costs involved...

Subject: Hole of Doom

I finally got the 951 clutch done (or, should I say,
it works ok on its first 2 mile test drive).  The
clutch action is so light, it feels like a different
car.

There are a few words of wisdom I have for those
undertaking this work themselves.  It is a small
but important point, one easily overlooked in the
dark, damp nature of home auto repair.

A few months ago, there was an article in, I think,
Sports Car International about the Porsche of Doom.
This Porsche 911T (I think) was a principal instrument
in the failure of the owner's marriage and the death
of his son.

My tale is less dramatic, but, since it nearly gave me
heart failure, equally compelling.

I call it the Hole of Doom.  I suspect all 944's have
this hole, but I don't know for sure.  On top of the
bellhousing, next to the DME sensor bracket, lies a 
hole whose purpose remains a total mystery to me.
However, it has 2 important implications.  The first
is that it is perfectly situated to receive hot engine
coolant should the heater control valve or hoses ever fail.
Of course, this would immediately ruin your clutch,
necessitating a >$1300 repair bill at your local Porsche 
mechanic;  or, you could be brave, and do it yourself.

In which case, the second implication of the hole is
important.  IT IS A PERFECT RECEPTACLE FOR DROPPING DME
SENSOR HOUSING BOLTS INTO.  These bolts are nearly
impossible to retrieve without removing the bellhousing.
(I should know, I spent 2 hours trying to get one).  For
those who may consider leaving a dropped bolt there, this
is not an option.  There is very little space between the 
flywheel and bellhousing, and the bolt would either jam
between the flywheel and engine block, or between the 
flywheel and bellhousing, causing major harm to both.

I made the mistake of attaching the torque tube and bellhousing
before replacing the DME sensor housing and sensors.  
Somehow, I managed to remove the bolt without removing any
components (this may have been the only time in my life where
I realized my dream of having the dexterity of a brain surgeon).
In general, removing a dropped bolt without at least removing
the bellhousing must be impossible.

My advice is, IMMEDIATELY after replacing the bellhousing, TAPE     
OVER the HOLE OF DOOM and replace the DME bracket and sensors.
Then, replace the torque tube and transmission.

I've noticed that stupid hole (951's)!  A friend got a free clutch from 
Porsche when his heater valve failed and leaked right into the hole.  
Mine was about to do the same - I replaced the valve "prior to failure" 
as HAL once said...

Once in awhile, the Porsche engineers do really dumb things.  The seem 
to have a missing department in Weissach: component integration.  This 
type of thing should've been caught by the factory and changed!

I think it was Automobile.  Very dark tale.  Also screwed up
his business too.  Wonder if anyone's made him an offer on
the car since its publication?

>I call it the Hole of Doom.  I suspect all 944's have
>this hole, but I don't know for sure.

You are absolutely correct.  There was a posting to the list by
someone whose "clutch was leaking coolant" a few months back, which
turned out to be the heater valve.  This has happened to more than
a few people.

The hole is there to read the timing marks off the flywheel.

In '87, Porsche moved the heater valve to the front end of the engine,
basically splicing it into the hose running from the water pump to
the heater tube which runs along the block.  I am unsure whether this
change was incorporated only into the design of the 944S, or also applied
to the existing 944 and 951 designs.  I think the latter.

In any event, I have suggested on several occassions, in this forum and
others, that someone/everyone order the needed parts and make the "upgrade."
I see no reason why one should not be able to relocate the valve in
earlier 85-1/2-forward models.  (Haven't looked at a pre-85 car to size
up the task.)  So far no one has told me they have.  Perhaps as these cars
now have six and more years on their hoses, folks will be inclined to
replace coolant hoses and in doing so try the relocation.

The relocated part has a nice side benefit.  When it fails (and they all
eventually do), it will tend to spray coolant on your oil filter, and
the dried coolant is very visible there, making it likely you'll spot the
problem before too long.  Especially since you periodically look in that
neighborhood to check the water pump for seeping, right?

Thanks for sharing your story!

Go for carbon fibre pads.  They meet all of your needs, including the
cost factor.  I cannot compare different kinds of CF pads; others on
this and other lists can.  However, I have used a couple sets of Cool
Carbon carbon fibre/kevlar pads and am very happy with them.  They
work great on the street, need no heating to work at autocrossing, and
do not fade/glaze/crumble at the track.  

Only one negative, which they share with the current OEM asbestos-free

metal backing anti-squeal shims used by Saab or Volvo.  I plan to cut-to-

Cool Carbon runs an ad in Pano, listing their distributors.  One is
European Performance Engineering, 1-508-651-1316.  Performacne Friction
also makes a well-respected carbon fibre product.

     Tilton makes a real nice master cylinder setup where the plunger assembly
is removeable and you can purchase different sizes of inserts. One of the things
you'll want to do is brush up on your high school math (they probably teach this
in elementry school now!) and calculate the ratio of master to caliper pressure
you'd like. This is done by computing the piston surface area for all the
calipers and comparing that to the master cylinder piston area. I found that by
going from a 7/8" to 1" insert, my brake pressure went up exponentially.
     I guess the gist of all this is, yes, contact Tilton... (I sometimes have a
tendancy to ramble, ask me "what time is it?" and I'll probably tell you how to
build a watch..... there I go again... bye...)

Before I switched to Cool Carbon, I used Repco Metalmasters -- I never
paid more than about $25 an axle.  I was very happy with them. 

Unlike the stock organics (or the carbon kevlars I'm using now), the
Metalmasters required some heating before they became completely
effective -- the first stop of the morning took a bit more pedal
pressure than normal (perhaps this is true of semimetalic pads in
general?).  

My mechanic complained that they cause extra rotor wear, but I was
willing to put up with that given their improved performance on the
track.  I understand that the carbon kevlar pads are even worse in this
respect. 

My Cool Carbons sure are squeaky, but they stop much better than the
Repcos (and unfortunately are about 5 times more expensive, though they
seem to wear a lot less -- maybe they'll last long enough to offset the
extra cost).

This general area in the 931 is referred to as the "hell hole" because
everything that ever fails is located there, including the heater valve.
Fortunately, there is no hole going into the bell housing, so dropped
parts just disappear (I believe a troll lives under the throttle body
and hides dropped clips, nuts etc).  Why isn't there say a plastic plug
for this hole on the 944? Is it not just an inspection access to see the
timing marks? Seems like most of the time, that baby should be capped.

Business opportunity for someone making a plastic plug perhaps?

I got my Cool Carbon's from RSR (they also advertise in Pano) -- they
were the only place I could find that would offer a 15% PCA discount.  I
tried Automobile Atlanta on the assumption that they'd match that price,
especially since I'm a `local' and see George at the track all the time.
He refused...

I talked with the proprietor of the firm that makes the Cool Carbon pads
at a track event in Alabama a few months back.  He said that he now
sells a backing pad that eliminates the squeel -- something like $10 an
axle. I've decided to skip them: I've gotten used to using the squeel to

Well, let's hope you get a *GOOD* job then -- 930's tend to eat turbos
about every 12k miles (at about $3500 per occurance if you're lucky), 
are nearly impossible for someone under 25 to get insurance for, and have 
consistently expensive maintenence costs.  Not to mention the $25k to $80k 
cost to acquire one (hint: don't buy a cheap one or you'll get to replace 
the turbo first thing...)

I'll assume that you meant "356 speedster" not "965 speedster" -- if
you meant the 356 speedster, you're looking at *BIG* bucks -- the last
one I saw for sale was at $79,500. If you're talking "911 speedster"
then you may have more luck -- they're only selling for about $35k or so
when (if?) you can find them, since they're pretty rare.

A much more rational choice for a first Porsche is a '78-83 911SC. They're
loads of fun, reasonably inexpensive to acquire ($12k-$25k), and have
reasonable maintenence costs. Not that I want to discourage you from wanting
an interesting somewhat rare car, but just remember that there a lot of
other people out there who want them relative to the number that exist,
and they *WILL* have lots more money than you do... It's sad, but the
true enthusiast is usually prohibited from owning the interesting cars,
because the collector-type people have them all.

Subject: re: 951 brakes

My girlfriend uses the Repco metalmasters in her 951.  The car is used
for autocross (BSP) as well as daily driving.  I don't recall any 
squeal or drivability problems.

I just changed to the Ferodo AF pads on my 911SC autocross (also BSP)/
street car from whatever was in there when I bought it.  Again, no
squeal or drivability problems.

I **always** use the permatex aerosol coating (that blue stuff) on 
the back of disk brake pads before installing.

951 brakes cost more, but the AF's were about $30/axle from automotion
and the metalmasters would have been $22/axle from Imparts (for my 911).

You can purchase an entire solid brakeline kit manufactured
by the O.E.M. Kohnor for a very reasonable price. It comes
with all fittings and lines bent into convenient loops that
unfold to the correct size. I kit for the complete 911 was
around $40 two years ago, from Stoddard (216) 951-1040.

The great thing about this kit is that you can use it for
any parts you need by just clipping off the end fittings
and using the brake line for any length your application
demands. It will last you a lifetime and you can share it
with friends.

Greg,

Congratulations!  I hope your skinned knuckles are healing rapidly.

I am curious about something, though.  When I did my '86 951 clutch, I
did not have to remove the DME sensor bracket (and therefore risk
dropping the bolts in the Hole of Doom).  The bell housing seemed to
clear it just fine on both removal and installation.  Are you sure
this was necessary on your car, or did it just make something else
easier?  My biggest hassle was getting the stupid ground strap on

                        More on Oxygenated Fuel
                          by Allan Caldwell
                     reprinted from "Porsche Spiel" 
           (Pacific Northwest Region, Porsche Club of America)
                             January 1993

Now that half of our first winter's introduction to oxygenated 
fuel is over, it is hoped our members in the Puget Sound, Spokane 
and Clark counties have all managed to cope with the ethanol 
blending.  Both Oregon and Washington are ending up with the 
ethanol blended fuels in the high carbon monoxide areas.  All of 
California, Nevada, and Colorado are using MTBE, which does not 
have the water problem. The incentive to use ethanol in Washington 
and Oregon appears to be due to the favorable tax credit granted 
by the state to oil companies who blend their gasolines with 
ethanol.  An oil company which offered MTBE blended gasoline in 
Washington would be at a distinct competitive disadvantage 
compared to those selling ethanol blends.  Although this tax break 
has been on the books since 1982, it has not been a factor until 
the federal clean air act took effect and required some kind of 
oxygenated fuel to be used.

Fortunately, reports of Porsche problems so far have been few, but 
it still may be too early to know the full extent of the damage.  
A number of cars, including my own domestic (with electronic fuel 
injection) have gone through several tanks of sputtering, 
stalling, and generally poor running during the first month of 
using the fuel.  Performance is noticeably reduced and gas mileage 
reductions seem to fall in the 10 to 20% region rather than the 2% 
theoretical prediction.  At a 10% reduction in gas mileage, the 
car uses the same amount of real gasoline as before to go a given 
distance and the alcohol that is added doesn't seem to be 
contributing much except oxygen.  Replacement of the fuel filter 
seems to help the problem somewhat.  Particularly with older cars, 
sediment and tank scale can be loosened by the alcohol and carried 
into the fuel system.  As long as the fuel filter picks it up, 
about all that happens is an intermittent restriction in fuel flow 
to the engine.  A spokesman for BP Oil indicated that as many as 
three filter changes might be required to get everything cleaned 
out.  BP has a guaranteed gas program that will pay for repairs to 
any owner's car who has problems with their gasolines.

Water contamination remains the biggest concern, especially for 
the newer cars.  Water, which will go right through the filter, 
can come from either the tank on the car or from the filling 
station.  In spite of the claims that all the stations would pump 
out the water from their tanks, a distressing number of cases have 
arisen where a car is driven into a station, filled up with fuel 
and then can not be started.  After being towed to the dealer for 
repair, it is determined that the fuel injection system is full of 
water or a water/ ethanol mixture.  If contamination is extensive, 
as much as $3000 to  $5000 worth of parts and labor can be 
required to return the car to normal working order.  The best 
guess on the cause for this sort of disaster is a situation where 
the car was fueled from a service station storage tank which had 
water in it and was recently filled.  An incoming fresh charge of 
gasoline and ethanol stirs up the bottom of the tank and forms 
separated globs of water and ethanol that don't immediately settle 
to the bottom.  If the pump pick-up happens to catch one the 
globs, then a high concentration of water is suddenly pumped into 
the car's fuel tank.  Several hours may be required before the 
globs of separated mixture all sink to the bottom of the tank. -Me 
answer seems to be to avoid filling your car's tank with gas until 
a half day or so has passed since the station got fuel.  If 
extensive fuel system repairs are required as a result of 
contaminated fuel, the cost can be picked up by the owner's 
comprehensive insurance.  A check with my own insurance company 
confirmed this.  The insurance company indicated that they would 
accept the claim since the fuel causing the problem was mandated 
by the government, and then they would subrogate the claim with 
the oil company.  Keeping the tank filled should go a long ways 
toward eliminating water contamination in the car's tank if the 
incoming fuel doesn't contain any water.

Several owners have asked about the use of "gas dryer" to 
counteract the water problem.  The gas dryers are a gas additive 
that is primarily made up of alcohol, and is usually added to a 
tank of gas at a rate of 12 ounces per 10 gallons of gasoline.  
Since 10 gallons of ethanol-blended gasoline already has one 
gallon of alcohol in it, adding another 12 ounces of alcohol that 
is able to absorb about 1% of its own weight in moisture won't 
help a bit.  Worse yet, a number of the gas dryers still on the 
market use methanol which is more corrosive than the ethanol and 
not recommended for any of the current fuel systems by car 
manufacturers.  In the August, 1992, Excellence Magazine, Bruce 
Anderson mentioned fuel additives that protect cars from the use 
of fuels containing alcohol.  One such additive is "Alcohol 
Protector," by Gold Eagle Co., 4400 S. Kildare, Chicago, 11 60632. 
This is the same company that makes STA-BIL, the fuel additive for 
protection of fuel that is stored in a car not being driven.  A 
recent check with Gold Eagle indicates that the Alcohol Protector 
product was dropped from the product line last summer due to a 
lack of consumer interest.  With more areas now using the ethanol 
oxygenated fuel, however, Gold Eagle is planning to introduce a 
new additive similar to the Alcohol Protector, which would 
accomplish the same results.  Unfortunately, it is still a couple 
of months away.

For those that want to bum nothing less than 100% gasoline, a 
check of stations just outside of the county borders indicates 
that it is readily available.  On the I-5 freeway just south of 
the southern edge of Pierce County at milepost 114 in the 
Nisqually flats there are Shell and Texaco stations and at 
milepost 111 just south of there at the top of the hill (Hawk's 
Prairie), there is a Chevron, ail with normal gasoline.  The Shell 
station has a prominent sign over the pumps reading, "My Fuel Does 
Not Contain Alcohol." A closer source for some of our members may 
be the Port Orchard and Bremerton areas in Kitsap County where all 
the stations we checked were selling normal gasoline.  Traveling 
north from Tacoma on highway 16, the county border is reached in 
about 16 miles from I-5 and the first stations are on Sedgewick 
Road (S.R. 160), 22 miles north of I-5.  From either the Colman 
ferry terminal in downtown Seattle or the Fauntleroy ferry 
terminal in West Seattle, numerous stations are accessible within 
5 miles or so after the ferry ride to the west side of Puget 
Sound.  The problem with the ferry ride is the $11.10 round trip 
fair (car and driver) plus the hour it takes going each way by the 
time you go through the onloading and off-loading routine.  It is 
an option for getting home with a fairly full tank of pure 
gasoline, however.  On the north em boundary of the region, the 
first station reached with normal gasoline on I-5 is at Conway, 
exit 221, 6 miles south of Mt.  Vernon.  This location is about 
die same distance north of Seattle as Nisqually is to the South, 
but may be more convenient for our members who live in the north 
end or in Everett.  In all the cases checked so far, the affected 
county line is being closely adhered to as the maximum limit for 
the ethanol and the stations just beyond all have had the real 
stuff.

None of us who really care about our cars like to constantly 
battle the risk of expensive damage, repair and possible 
replacement of precious original parts due to the marginal fuel 
selected for us by the oil companies.  It is hoped that by 
November, 1993, when the second year of oxygenated fuel gets 
underway, the oil companies will see fit to offer an option of the 
better quality fuels already available that meet the same 
requirements, but are not subject to our water absorption problems 
here in the "damp belt" capital of the U.S.A. A 10 or 15 cents per 
gallon premium (or more) for oxygenated fuel without mechanical 
risk would be a small price to pay for trouble free motoring 
compared to the problems and lost time encountered by a number of 
drivers this winter.

The 40PII Solexes which came on the 912 were fitted with the  'split-shaft'
throttle mechanism, which means each venturii has an

shaft and butterfly. They are notoriously troublesome re adjustment, balancing,

Mark,
I can't add to anything John Wright has already very thoroughly wrote about
your Zenith vs Weber dilemma. In fact, I'm saving that one for future
reference. But I would like to offer some info regarding your emblem situation.

One of the many unique and subtle features of the early 911S was an aluminum
engine lid. As a result of getting hit in the rear, I have seen T's and E's
needing a new (or good used) engine lid inherit one from an S that was being
parted out. (Remember, 10 or 15 years ago, an early 'S' was mostly still
thought of as just another 911). Hence, they inadvertently got an aluminum lid,
and because the S emblem was already on it and/or the old one was ruined in the
collision, it went along for the ride with the lid, and unconcerned or
unknowing body shops put them on the car. That could be the case with your car
or it could be the former owner got further than it appears in his quest for an
S. 

Put a magnet to your engine lid. If it doesn't hold, you have a fairly rare and
desirable part. I'm sure the difference (in $$$) you can get in swapping the
aluminum one for a standard steel one will more than cover the cost of a new
911T emblem. Good luck.

I'm running 15x8" wheels with 205/50-15 Comp T/A R1's.  They just fit
under the front; I had to pull out the rear fenders a little.

The widest wheel is determined by the tire size you want to run and
whether you're willing to roll the fender lip.

The only way a 15x8" wheel will fit is if you're trying to run little
teeny (in diameter) tires like I am.  Anything larger in diameter will
require a little more offset up front at full lock, and may therefore
require flaring the fenders.

Note: Most 205's are a little small for 8" rims.  I'm really pushing
it.  Make sure your tire/rim combination is valid and safe before
proceeding.

>>So my questions:
>>What can I do to generate more interest?

>>How do I get people to call?

Unfortunately, you (and many others) are a victim of the economy and the
current low demand for sports cars in general. It's like what Harm Lagaay
(Chief Designer, new Porsche Boxster) was quoted as saying in the latest
Panorama, "Nobody needs a Porsche. It's a lust car. It's something you want
emotionally or you don't...." So, in a down economy, practicality takes
priority over emotions. Jeep Cherokees, Dodge Caravans, and P/U trucks are
selling pretty well. Nevertheless, to help your cause, I suggest the following:

1) Go national in your advertising. Consider placing ads in Porsche Panorama,
Excellence, Hemmings, Autoweek, and if your budget allows, large metropolitan
newspapers (LA Times, etc). Also the local or nearest PCA chapter newsletter. 

2) Attend every car event you can (swap meets, shows, club racing events, even
non-Porsche related events) and display a simple For Sale sign with price.
Display the sign when parked anywhere, or even when you drive, depending on how
comfortable you are with that. The idea is to get as much exposure as possible.
Be creative, but judicious. Remember, you're trying to attract the potential
buyer who has $10K laying around for what most likely will be a weekend toy.  
 
3) Consider taking a trade. Either an even trade, or plus or minus cash. If the
trade vehicle is more marketable to the general buying public (like a Honda,
Caravan, etc), it may be to your advantage. As off-the-wall as it sounds, I
know of a 912 owner who tried, but failed to sell his car at a fair and
reasonable price. So he traded it for a P/U truck of approximate equal value.
He had no trouble selling the truck the next day for what he originally tried
to sell the Porsche for.  

4) Make up a flyer and send it (or fax it) to some of the bigger sports car
dealers in the country specializing in new and used exotics (look in Autoweek
for at least a half dozen of them). Your price seems quite right, so if they
see a possibility for a profit and have a potential waiting customer, they
would buy it. Also, they often buy and sell amongst themselves to give the
perception of a high turnover.   
   
Basically, you just have to work at it. Right now, just placing a local ad, as
you have experienced, isn't enough. Hope this helps some and good luck.

Yes, but the split shaft guys are *MUCH* better once you get them adjusted
since they give you the ability to adjust each of the venturis separately.
For racing applications, it's the only way to fly. Of course, you have a
really interesting time getting them set up right in the first place...

The solid shaft guys have fewer moving parts, and as a result may be 
simpler to deal with. Don't give up -- just get out the synchronizer(s)
and get with it.

While it seems strange that the tool provided with the car doesn't fit,
it isn't surprising to hear that the problem exists. There is a replacement
"hotter plug" for the Rx7 which has the same problem - the plug socket
that fits it won't clear the metal lip on the engine. Racing Beat
sells a machined plug socket that fits the hole - perhaps it would help
in your case also? It was about $25 last I checked...

Subject: 914 clutch tube fix (was Hydraulic clutch in 914?)

Ok, I am just about convinced to do the clutch tube fix rather than the 
hydraulic clutch.  My only concern will be that once the clutch tube is
fixed, I don't have to keep adjusting it or living with having to put the
darned thing down to the floor to "barely" shift gears.  The reason I wanted
to go hydraulic is that it is sort of self adjusting and to be honest it
is a much better way to design a clutch system.

But I digress.  The current fix is 2 pieces of 1/4" steel, welded at a right
angle so that one piece is parallel with the firewall and one is parallel
with the floor pan.  The floor pan piece extends past the firewall piece
by about a 1" and there are some gussets welded in place.  This piece is
bolted to the floor pan, because the firewall-clutch tube junction was
pulled into the car about 2 inches, thus ripping the firewall apart.
In the middle of the metal plate, we drilled a hole, passed the clutch tube
through it, and brazed it into place.  It seemed like a pretty good fix and
from what I can tell, the tube is firmly anchored back there.

I guess that the problem might be that the clutch tube is loose in the tunnel.
It was suggested that I use metal cable clamps with the rubber sleeve inside.
One question... how do you mount these in the tunnel?  In can barely see 
inside the stupid thing, let alone get a hand inside to drive a screw.  Since
this technique must work, any advice on how to mount these clamps?  Where do
I put them?  How many do I use?  How is the clutch pedal end of the tube 
supposed to be oriented? When we pulled the tube out, I noticed a bend that
I assume is supposed to point toward the pedal assembly.  Is this the case?
How far is the tube supposed to stick out at the firewall? Is there a reason
that my last cable broke right at the junction between the bowden tube and the
place where the clutch tube sticks out of the firewall?

Here's one other question that I have always had... does the clutch cable simply rub against the inside of the clutch tube?  If so, won't it just wear a 
groove in the end on the tube where it exits to the pedal assembly?
Oh, and if I use cable clamps, do I just bolt the tube to the right side of
the tunnel?

And Kevin  (Kevin Gross)...if you could reference that article in european car
I would appreciate it.  I must have missed that article.

A lot of questions, I know, but thanks for reading

I looked on the back panel in my '86 944 for these option codes, but
there was only a small label with details on the jack. Am I looking
in the wrong place? More specifically I was looking in the spare
tire well on the panel across from where the jack and spare mount.
Do these options decode the same for the 944 as the 951?

Thanks!

Just a quick thought...I replaced the plugs on a GTI 16V once, and noticed
that the only plugs that would work are those with a 5/8" hex.  I was
given some by a parts store that had the usual 13/16" hex on them, but
there was no way that they were going to fit.  Is this the case with the
S2 as well?

P.S. I got plugs from the dealer which worked fine.

Brandon,

Here's some info from a 1987 list of options brochure:

C02     assume this is US emissions (every car I've seen has it)
395     16" Forged Alloy Wheels
431     Leather Steering Wheel 363MM
474     Sport Shock Absorbers
533     Alarm System
650     Electric Sunroof
945     not listed, but 946 is partial leather seats.


I received the list three years ago from Frank Kerfoot, also on
porschephiles, and found it very useful in looking for a used Porsche.

Anyone know of a good source for these lists??? I found the 1987 list is
only 80% useful for 1986 cars, for example, and the reverse would be even
less useful.

I don't remember right off where the label is for the jack, but the
options list is on the vertical panel under the rear edge of the
back window, which has the license plate on the outside. Facing the
back end of the car, the label is about 2 feet to the left of the
centerline of the car. To see the label you will need to unsnap the
top edge of the rear carpet, and then lean over with your head in the
car. I don't remember if the label is upside down so that you can read
it easily in that position, or if you have to read the numbers 
upside down.

I believe that the same option codes apply for the 944 and 951, although
the 951 has some items as standard equipment which are options on the
944 (I believe), so they may not show up on the sticker. The option
numbers for the 911 and 928 families, are, if I recollect, entirely
different.

Subject: Re: FW: solex vs. webers 

With regards to Solex 40PII carbs, there is not a whole lot of areas that can
wear out and cause problems.  The most likely wear point is the butterfly
shaft or the carb body where the shaft  fits.  This causes two problems:
Air leakage past the shaft which screws up the idle mixture, and butterfly
chatter which causes the butterfly valve to eat into the throat.  Both these
will cause the idle screws to be ineffective in getting the idle speed down
to the spec limit of 900 rpm for the S-90. I have a set of these which leak
and have investigated rebushing the shafts, but it's an expensive proposition.

The other moving part is the accelerator pump, but it is a diaphragm type 
pump.  Unless the diaphragm is holed, or the check valve is dirty, there
isn't much to go wrong there.

My experience with the Solexes is that the other source of problems is warpage
of the top plate or the bottom mounting flange.  The material is soft, and 
if you are overzealous about cinching down the mounting nuts between the
carb and the manifold, you warp the flange.  It no longer seals, and the air
leakage again screws up the idle.  This can be fixed by lapping the flanges
with a glass plate and some fine corundum sandpaper.  The top plate can
likewise be lapped after you take off the float needle valve.

Just my 2 cents worth...

The idle on my '66 911 drifted (varied wildly from traffic light to

A bottle of STP Fuel Injector Cleaner worked wonders! After about 40
miles spread over a few days the drifting is gone, the spitting has
stopped, and the engine runs smoother. Best $3.49 I have spent

Yeah but there's no problem with that. The cable guide tube

just measure it, go down to the local hardware store, and buy the
appropriate size plug/grommet. 

We needed to find a body plug to seal up a hole between the interior
and firewall; I went down to Falk's (an old, local hw store that has
all sorts of good odds and ends).  They have lotsa bins filled with all

A properly operating cable system is relatively bulletproof as well. The
adjustments are required very infrequently if the only thing they are
adjusting for is actual wear. I drove both an early 911 and a 914 a
lot of miles without a problem and with very few adjustments (although
I am aware that other 914s have your problem as well).

That certainly sounds plenty strong. Is there any chance of small 
movements between the welded plates and the floor of the car? The
clutch cable is a relatively high force/small movement system, so
even small movements under load will make the pedal low and "spongy".
Also, is the end of the cable jacket still a nice fit (no opportunity
for longitudinal play) on the end of the tube?

I might try drilling the holes from the bottom of the car (with careful
layout). Then you "only" need to get your hand into the end of the
tunnel with the cable clamp and a screw. Use a suitable nut on the
bottom of the car. Perhaps make it easier by soft soldering the screw
to the clamp, then slip the clamp over the tube and slide it along.
The solder will keep things together during assembly, and allow
tightening the nut from the bottom without holding the screw inside
the tunnel.  I've forgotten where the baffles and other obsticles are
in the tunnel. I would have expected that just a few clamps would be
enough.

That sounds like a clue. I would look for relative movements of the cable
jacket relative to the tube and/or bracket while someone else depresses
the clutch.

The cable should exit the tube in about the center of the tube. At points
inside where the tube bends the cable will rub, but my recollection is 
that it has a plastic or teflon cover on it for most or all of the
region where it is inside the tube.

>Oh, and if I use cable clamps, do I just bolt the tube to the right side of

I would expect that, or the bottom of the car, whichever is closer,
would be fine.

Fred -

Dunno what your problem is.  The 944S2 takes either a WR 5 DC (p/n
999.170.179.90) or a WR 7 DC (p/n 999.170.158.90) plug, depending on how
you use and drive your car.  This from tech bulletin book G, group 2,
number 9006, dated 5 Oct 90.

These are not the "peanut" plugs someone mentioned in an earlier posting.
Sixteen-valve VW's use peanut plugs.  You can tell them from the Bosch
designation.  The first letter W means that the plug has a 14 x 1.25 mm
thread, and a 21 mm hex "head".  Peanut plugs have designations beginning
with the letter F, have the same thread, but have a 16 mm hex head.  (The
21 mm corresponds to the typical 13/16" tool, the 16 mm to a 5/8" tool.)
There are a bunch more possible initial letters designating other thread
and head configurations.

Try fitting your new plug into your 13/16" socket.  Spark plug sockets
usually have rubber inserts to protect, centre, and hold the plug during
installation.  The plug may be getting hung up on the insert.  If this
is the case, use a *minimal* amount of, say, a silicon lubricant on the
insert.  Best to avoid using anything if you can, because what of it which
stays on the plug's ceramic shell will only degrade isolation of the
electrode from the block.

If the socket is indeed not clearing the bore, which sounds really weird,
I guess you'll have to go find a different socket.  If you have a 21 mm
deep, try it.  Needless to say, Snap-On has a lovely selection of sockets.

Btw, there was another tech bulletin in recent history in which Porsche
told us not to lubricate new spark plug threads.  (It is common practice
to use a little anti-seize.)  Bosch agrees with them, and says that
lub'ing the threads changes the correct torquing value.  They also say
that the plugs come with the right kind and amount of lubricant already
on the threads.

Chin up, Fred!  You've mastered the 944S2 air filter, and this will soon
be another notch in your tool holster!  Take solice in the fact that for
MY 89 Porsche deleted the crankcase coolant drain bolt, and you will
never have to go hunting for that little sucker.

WD40 is also great for those pesky parking lights and brake lights that
don't light up.  I applied WD40 to the sockets of all my lights when I got
my 911 and have never had a light failure due to socket corrosion since then...

I once saw an old T-bird (the ones with the full width light housing in the
back) where all of the lights in the back (8 or 10 of them...) had been
soldered to their sockets when a few shots of WD40 would have done the trick.

of the bell housing up, then use a magnetic probe to fish out the lost part.
The hole was then unceremoniously capped with a stock plastic plug.
But then BMW's deserve that kind of treatment.   ;^)

Fred -

I asked my mechanic today whether there was anything weird about S2
spark plugs.  He said "No, why?"  I told him of your woes.  He added
a few pieces of information to the pot.  First, your problem can arise
if you have cross-threaded the plug in the block.  It will be crooked,
limiting space between the plug and the bore wall.  This is very unusual
in the S's because of their deep bores, which have the effect of lining
up a plug as you install it.

You may have something left on the old plug, which is why you cannot get
the socket over it.  911's will often leave, if I remember his words,
the metal clip or boot sleeve when the plug wire is removed.

Finally, he pointed out that your toolkit wrench is guaranteed to be the
right-sized tool.  Apparently all the German manufacturers make a point of
including a spark plug wrench any time they use a non-standard plug, such
as the peanut plugs used in VW's and M-series Bimmers.

Subject: Black marks on white paint


In the last few months I've noticed some black 'streak' marks on the
paint on the door behind under the door handle on my 911.  This is the
area where fingernails tend to scrape against the paint as the door is
opened, so this is the likely cause.  It wouldn't bother me so much
except that the marks don't come off in normal washing, even with some
light scrubbing.  Since the car (911 C4 targa, white paint) is only
nine months old I haven't polished it yet, though I guess polishing
would probably remove the marks.

My wife doesn't normally wear nail polish so I can't blame her for it :-)
Anybody else seen anything similar or have a solution?

Thanks

Dear Porsche people,

Today on the way into work my generator light came on in my

but the battery is a brand new MP88 and the generator was replaced
about 10 months ago. I am going to check the voltage after work,

the voltage or amperage is to high or low. Any advice on what to

Subject:      RE: '74 914 price & 944 speaker grille

Firstly, the Old Cars price guide lists the book of a 74 914 with a 1.8 (close
enough) as Cond6: $550 5: $1700 4: $2800 3: $5600 2: 9800 1: 14000
Obviously, $14,000 is a little high, although cond. 1 indicates a 95+ pt. car.

Secondly, that grille at the top of the early ( I assume ) 944 dash is (I belie
ve) the same as in a 924 I once owned.  If you stick a screwdriver in the very
top or very bottom of it, you can pry the plastic pegs securing it out of their
rubber grommets.  It makes an excellent place for a center channel speaker, If
you choose to set your audio system up with one.  Center channel modes are avai
lable on many "good" crossover systems.

Subject: 944 speaker grill?

My '84 944 has, by previous owner, a very discrete CB radio installed under
the dash and uses this grill for the CB speaker.  If I have it turned on an
incoming signal cuts the "regular" radio or tape signal.  It works great and
except for the handset (when I have it plugged in) totally hidden.  It also is
NOT factory built or installed.  My guess is the grill would, in a society
less addicted to multi-speaker car radios, house the single speaker for a
modest sound system.

I can remove almost all marks (including the marks that show up
under the door handle) with Mequire's Cleaner/Wax.  This is a
non-abrasive cleaner that disolves anything from tar to tree pitch.
It even removes the black marks left from cones :)

Polish is not necessary nor is vigorous scrubbing.

I use Zymol wax to finish any areas I've cleaned.

I've heard good things about them too, but they won't insure me because

I'd first try to figure out what the marks are caused by.  If they are
some sort of stuff on the paint, try removing them with a wax/silicone
remover (PrepSol, Pre-Kleeno, Acryl-Cleen).  If they are due to finger-
nail scratches in the paint, use a mild polish such as Meguires #9 or
3M Imperial Hand Glaze.  (Meguires #9 is less abrasive than the better-
known #7, and is the right thing to use on a clear-coated paint.)

You might also just try waxing the area.  Wax itself is a pretty good
solvent.

Most CD changers have the option (either included or sold separately) of being

allow use of a CD changer with the Blaupunkt Reno mentioned.  CD changers are

++ Dear Gents...
++ Patching in a CD player is best done by direct connect into the control
++ head (to allow volume and [tone] equalizer control).  The reason for this
++ is any other method degrades the sound quality.  For the most part, FM
++ descriminators do not have the dynamic range or signal to noise capability
++ that a CD player inherently provides.  Playback into a cassette interface
++ suffers worse because of the tape head losses in the inductive nature of
++ picking up the signal.  <dont do this>
++  An option I use is an equalizer with dual selectable inputs WITH volume
++ control (Hyfonics TRITON model i think...) which allows full control
++ and outputs for a 6 channel (50W each) bank of amplifiers.  This EQ also
++ has subwoofer outputs, a MUST for true sound on the road.
++  To make it all work you must take great care installing a proper mix
++ of drivers (subwoofers, woofers, midrange, and tweeters) to handle the 
++ range the CD player will provide.  I mounted a pair of 8" Pyle subwoof
++ drivers on a 1" X 16" pine board and attached the assembly to the trunk
++ supports just behind the back seats (chevy cavalier), airtight seal.
++ Two months went into installation, Testing =8^}, balancing, and
++ locktighting.  What a mirror shaker...!

From: Carl Samos <cjs33278@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu>
Subject: Re: CD Changers


For the best quality, you must connect the CD changer directly into the
signal path, not through a cassette adapter or an FM interface.  A system
is limited by its weakest link.  FM tuners and cassette heads don't have the
quality that a CD does, so if you use one of these interfaces, then you are
limited by the quality of the interface.   Unfortunately you don't always
have the luxury of being able to connect a CD changer directly.  In that
case then you either have to use one of these interfaces, or replace your
head unit that can control a CD changer.  

A mail-order company called Crutchfield has some decent information about
adding CD to factory radios, and they also sell Blaupunkt head units and
CD changers.  Their prices are OK, but sometimes they have stuff marked
down pretty competitively.  You can get a free catalog by calling
800-955-9009.

If you have any specific questions, don't hesitate to ask.

	Howdy all,

	I had a very traumatic weekend.  I was looking in the paper on
Friday and found a 914/6 for 5,000.  Wow I thought.  That is REALLY
cheap.  I guess that car must be a total basket case.  I called the
guy anyway, though.  He told me that the car was in really good
mechanical condition (he is the original owner) but has a very serious
rust problem.  The engine, trans, etc have all ben rebuilt/replaced.
The car has about 200K on it. All the electricals are fine.  It just
needs alot of rust restoration.  I almost went and bought the car, but
since I just bought two of the 4-cylinder ones it would be a bit much.
But, if anyone is interested in a cheap 914/6 for a restoration
project I would be glad to post the guys phone number...

	It would have been SO nice to have a 914/6..... Oh well :-(.

Okay, I'm approx. 1 month away from ending a 8 month period of
replacing/fixing sheet metal and its time to worry about the engine!

Its a '66 912 that has been stored for the last 10 years.  When I bought
it, he did fire up the engine - used a gas can and separate fuel pump.
She runs, idles, etc.

So, what exactly do I need to plan to do before I drive it around
the block??

I do plan on the following:
	1.  Change oil, gasket, filter, usual stuff.
	2.  All new brake and gas lines (needed them).
	3.  Rebuild fuel pump.
	4.  Gas tank rebuilt.
	5.  Total tune-up (plug, wires, points, etc.)
	6.  New belt, air filters

	brake calipers, mast. cyl., wheel bearings, etc., all rebuilt 
	new throw-out bearing, and a whole lot of other stuff.


BUT, anything else?
	1.  How do I know if I need to adjust the valves?
		Is this something a weekend wrencher can do?
		Do I have to do this before I test drive it?
	2.  Lead additive in gas?
	3.  Any carb-cleaner better than another?


Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

Subject: Roll bars required?

Folks,

My PCA region has for some time required any cabriolet (a car without
a roof) to have at least a roll bar if it is to autocross.  This has
become an issue with a couple who have just traded up to a 944 cabri
and would like to autocross.  As our region's safety chair, I am
in the process of bringing the issue to our board for a re-think. 

My understanding is that, in SCCA, no roll bar would be required in
a street class, but it would be required in modified or prepared.

I would like to hear from members of other PCA regions and other clubs
which sponsor autocrosses.  Do you require a roll bar/cage, and under
what circumstances?  Please answer directly to me rather than the
whole list, unless you'd like the audience.

I personally have very mixed feelings.  On one hand, I very much want
to stimulate participation by removing barriers.  On the other, bad
things do happen from time to time.  We do not have the numbers to
split participants into street/prep/mod type levels of seriousness.

Thanks in advance.

WPO - Porsche
ZZZ - rest of world
91 - it's a 91x car
Z - "test digit", which is Z on R.o.W. cars and usually 0 on US/Canada cars
C - '82
S - made in Stutgart
1 - the "x" in "91x" i.e. 911
4 - R.o.W. Targa (like mine!)
1059 - serial number

The other stuff is option codes. I don't have that handy.

Yeah, all good. Also do a compression check before getting too far
in. If that's bad, you might as well just do the rebuild right now.
In fact, do that first.

Second, you probably want to add "rebuild carbs" to your list. At
the very least you want to get all the gook out of the little passages
so that it has some chance of running right. Unless, of course, you bought
new carbs...

>	brake calipers, mast. cyl., wheel bearings, etc., all rebuilt 

Good! Lots of people overlook that stuff...

>	new throw-out bearing, and a whole lot of other stuff.

Hmmm. And you want to replace the little plastic cup gizmo on the
clutch actuating arm too. And possibly the various cables, but I'd
personally give the old ones a shot at working first...

>BUT, anything else?

You do. Period. And it's really pretty easy, but if you've never adjusted
valves on anything before *PLEASE* find a friend who has and get them to
help you. It will very much decomplicate your life...

>	2.  Lead additive in gas?

Nope. All of the Porsches have steel inserts in the aluminium heads.
Hence they don't have the valve precession problem endemic to American
V8s from the same period, which only had seats cut into the heads.
And when you eventually do have to do that valve job, you just replace
the seats and valves with the current stuff, and don't ever worry about
it again. 

I picked this up from Oak Oakleshien (I *KNOW* I mis-spelled that...)
some years ago regarding BMW Boxer motorcycles. Turns out that he's
some kind of metalurgist/mechanical engineer half-breed and that actually
figuring out what the root causes of the problem were provided endless
amusement for him. Later saw a similar writeup in one of the Up-Fixin'
Der Porsche volumes from the PCA.

>	3.  Any carb-cleaner better than another?

Tolulene. Or tri-chlor-ethane (or is that -ethyline? I forget...
whatever it is, it's the current prefered replacement for the late,
much-lamented carbon-tetrachloride. Damn the EPA anyway...)

My *favorite* carb cleaner trick is to use a vapor degreaser, but
since I'm not in the build-a-bunch-a-hardware biz anymore, I no
longer have access. Next best bet, a medium-sized ultrasonic cleaner
filled with one of the above-mentioned solvents. Followed by high-
pressure bursts of very, very filtered compressed air. And the old
when-in-a-pinch version: a can of spray brake cleaner (dries "drier"
than carb cleaner...)

Subject: S2 TORSION BAR

I am currently in the process of upgrading the suspension on my '89 944S2
to the M 030 Sport Suspension option which is equivalent to an '89 944Turbo
or '88 Turbo S suspension.  I am changing the rear torsion bars from 24mm to
25.5mm.  The Porsche Spec book says the spring strut adjustment (tilt of
spring strut) for a Coupe with 24mm bar is 22 degrees and M 030 is 18 degrees
with a resulting 8mm lower ride height.  My question is what is the angle
referenced to and is this angle installed in the car with control arm and
rear hub attatched or with the torsion bar "tube" out of the car?  My "tube"
is currently on my garage floor as it has to be removed to swap the bars.

I performed this surgery 3 years ago on my old '83 944 when I installed
26mm Automotion bars and I arrived at a spring strut angle by using ratios
of stiffness (fourth power of the diameters) to ratios of factory ride height
for the two bars offered, 23.5mm and 24.5mm.  I also used the factory guide
of 1 degree of strut angle equals 5mm ride height.  I am planning on using
this approach again, but since I am using factory parts I would like to use
the factory settings.  Is this in the workshop manual?  If I want to buy a
manual set (which I will someday), my dealer says that I need the 6 volume
944 set, the S2 volume 1A supplement, and the Turbo volume with supplements.
Should be somewhere around $300, but I would rather spend the money on parts.

Subject: My 944S2 spark plugs -- the saga ends

A week ago, I wrote about my difficulty in installing new spark plugs into my
car.  I think my message was misunderstood by many of you, since most of the
replies discussed the plugs themselves.

This wasn' t the issue, rather the problem was that my sparkplug wrenches
would not fit into the narrow, deep recess on the engine head where the plugs
live.  (In the S2 each plug is about 5 inches down inside a very narrow hole,
and this hole is too narrow in diameter for my  spark plug wrenches to fit.
Even the plug wrench supplied by Porsche with the car was too wide to fit!)

I telephoned PCNA in Reno.  They couldn't have been more friendly or
helpful, and sent me a new plugwrench (no charge). I was concerned when it
arrived yesterday because it looked exactly like the one I already had, but
when I used it last night, it worked just fine. This new one is a tiny
amount smaller in outside dimension, so it just fits into the recess.

A happy ending and a pleasant experience dealing with PCNA.

FRED

PS:	When you eyeball the old plugwrench and the new, they look identical,
	but I guess its outside size is about 1 millimeter smaller, so it
	fits.

Well, the best thing to do is figure out how much you're willing to
spend. And what your interests/requirements are.

For example, you might decide you can spend up to $40k and you want
a car that has the usual high standard of performance you'd expect
from a 911, but nothing "extra", and you mainly plan on driving it
on streets and highways, if in a somewhat "spirited" manner.

Or, you might decide you can spend up to $10k and you want to go 
do the autox/time trial/track day thing real bad...

Or, you might decide you want an extra nice, concours grade "special
interest" car.

Standard rule of thumb: the newer cars are much more reliable and
predictable in their handling (for people who don't have 911 
driving experience). They also have a lot less "character".

The older cars have much more "character", but bring with them a whole
host of problems (not the least of which is they way they were treated
by their previous owners!).

Special interest (i.e. really rare, and really old) cars have their own
special set of problems, and are best avoided unless you have lots of
spare cash.

Personal preference: I like the '72 and '73 911S non-sunroof coupes,
but only in original equipment configuration (i.e. still with the 
Bosch mechanical fuel injection, still 2.4 liter, no flares, etc.)
Loads of performance, kinda different, not too expensive to keep on 
the road unless you get to rebuild the FI pump...

I also like (and own one of!) the late ('80 and up) 911SCs. The early 
cars have a serious low-end performance problem due to very enlarged
intake systems. And the later cars don't suffer that much in comparison
on the high end. They are super reliable, have very good performance
and fall into the "affordable" price range ($12-20k). And if you want
a Cab, they started in '83 (last year for SCs).

And for some bizarre reason, I also like (and will acquire as my next 911)
the '86 *factory* Turbo Look cars. They have the Turbo suspension and brakes,
and bodywork, but the standard 3.2 Carrera engine. '86 is also the last year
for the 915 transmission and the first year they *REALLY* got the A/C right.

Subject: 944 Heel & Toe

This was discussed months ago, but without any conclusion, I feel ...

In my view, the placement of the gas and brake pedals in the 944
is very counter to heel & toe technique.

The brake pedal is way too high, so that you can hardly press both at the 
same time, even if you use the toe on the brake and heel on the gas.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Track season is rapidly approaching!

I dunno.  In my '87 951 (944 turbo), the pedal layout is about as
perfect as I could hope for...  Maybe your 944 has a different pedal
layout?  Remember that when you're on the track you'll be brakeing a bit
(a lot?) harder, so the brake pedal will be lower than on the street.
Even so, I heel/toe regularly on the street and have no complaints.  The
pedals on my friend's 930, on the other hand, are a mess.  Feels like
driving a truck...

Fred,
   I might agree that heel & toe technique doesn't work very well for my
944 as well, but...the pedals are close enough together to use more of a
side to side method. I find that I can put the ball of my foot on the brake
and roll my foot to the side enough to blip the throttle as I'm downshifting.
I have used this technique for autocross events and plan to use it when I start
running at Texas World Speedway in April. Hope this helps.

***********************************************************************

On my 1980 911sc the brake pedal is also too high.  I shimmed the 
throttle with a piece of wood so that it is about the same height
as the brake when the brakes are engaged.  I used 3 sheet metal 
screws to attach the wood to the throttle pedal.  Works great.

I also considered buying another pedal assembly.  I would have cut
and welded the brake pedal to set the height.  The other method is
certainly easier!

An even easier way to adjust the pedal height on a 911, at least
on an 80, is to remove the wooden floor panel behind the pedals
and adjust the length of the rod which acuates the master cylinder.
It been a while but I think it has rod ends on both ends of the rod
which can be turned to lengthen or shorten the rod, changing
the pedal height to what ever feels right for you.

Fred (& others), excuse me if I replied the first time 'round on this one...

Heel & toeing isn't easy on the street for exactly the reason you site. 
 But once you get to the track, where you're braking much harder, the 
pedal gets to the correct level relative to the throttle.  You'll 
probably like it much better once you hit the track.

I'm pretty sure that the brake a clutch pedal heights are adjustable,
and the throttle pedal may be as well.  Different folks have different
preferences, depending a lot on foot size and how you like to heel-toe.

Steve,

The only way I could do this repair on a '77 911S was to drop the engine. I
suspect that you'll have to do the same. The parts that are mentioned are
at the top of the front of the engine. It's possible that an experienced
mechanic who had done many of these could get by by lowering only the front
of the engine, just the right amount. As for the repair itself, it's very
easy. You'll probably want to clean all the oil and grime off the front of
the engine; That will take most of the time. There is also a breather hose
at the front of the engine that is probably oil-soaked and in need of
replacement.

Hope this helps.

Steve,

It sounds like the "breather area."  I had the oil light switch go 
out on me a few years ago.  It's (as Mark mentions) in the front of 
the engine.

You can do the repair without dropping the engine.

1)    Raise the rear of the car and support **SECURLY** with stands.

2)    Support the engine with a floor jack.

3)    Loosen the transmission mounts (do **NOT** remove them).
      These are two 19(?) mm bolts forward of the transmissison.

4)    Disconnect the Oxygen sensor (at left side of engine compartment
      near fuel filter).

5)    Remove the four bolts the attach the engine to the cross 
      brace in the very back of the engine compartment.

6)    **Slowly** lower the engine with the floor jack until you can
      get your to the front of the engine.

You may also need to: 

7)    Disconnect the oil lines on the right side of the engine.  Watch
      these as you lower the engine.

8)    Remove the CIS duct that goes from the lifting plate to the
      throttle body (try not to drop crud into this area!).

FYI:  I use the term forward and back with respect to the CAR, i.e. 
forward is toward the front of the car.  Some 911 people seem to think
that the front of the engine is toward the back of the car.  I don't.

Before you start this procedure check the oil return tubes that run
from the heads to the crankcase.  There are two on each side.  These
can be replaces w/o engine removal by using the colapsable tubes (about
$50-$60 a set of 4).

The first indication I had of a problem was that the oil light started
to behave erratically.  The pressure gauge always showed pressure, but
I would have to start the car a few times to get the light to go out.

Then I noticed that the bottom of the engine was wet.  Then there was 
all that smoke from the oil dripping on the exhaust...

*********************************************************************

Folks,

My PCA region has for some time required any cabriolet (a car without
a roof) to have at least a roll bar if it is to autocross.  This has
become an issue with a couple who have just traded up to a 944 cabri
and would like to autocross.  As our region's safety chair, I am
in the process of bringing the issue to our board for a re-think. 

My understanding is that, in SCCA, no roll bar would be required in
a street class, but it would be required in modified or prepared.

I would like to hear from members of other PCA regions and other clubs
which sponsor autocrosses.  Do you require a roll bar/cage, and under
what circumstances?  Please answer directly to me rather than the
whole list, unless you'd like the audience.

I personally have very mixed feelings.  On one hand, I very much want
to stimulate participation by removing barriers.  On the other, bad
things do happen from time to time.  We do not have the numbers to
split participants into street/prep/mod type levels of seriousness.

Thanks in advance.

*********************************************************************

Kevin, 

This is from memory so...

In Zone 7 (S.F. Bay Area, CA) no roll bar is required for either 
stock or production (production is similar to SCCA street prepared).
Stock and production are the two "lowest" of seven classes in Zone 7.

The only cars I have ever heard of turning over at an auto-x are tall
boxy thangs (VW wabbits) with sticky tires and stock suspension.  The
ususal scenerio (sp?) is that at the end of a slalom, the suspension
will compress enough to colapse a tire, hook a rim, and flip the car.

I don't think you need to worry unless there are curbs that a car 
could slide into to trip it.  If that is the case, then I think you
have a worse safety problem than lack of roll bars...

We are currently in the process of revising our auto-x rules and 
classes.  Well, there has been a proposal from the "gang of seven"
to make some changes, which has been met with approval from 
**everyone** (except Mike) --honest, I saw the petition.  In any
event, I can send you the old and new rules so you can see what 
other regions are doing.  This may help you if you have trouble
getting proposals approved.

Hi

How can I tell an 89 year 911 C4 from a 90 year of same?  I was told that the
control to raise/lower the tail spoiler is absent on the 89 year model.  I
was also told that the on-board computer became standard equipment as of 90
year and so a third steering column stalk appeared (but I don't believe this
one).

As you might have guessed, I have a 911 C4 (currently for sale) and someone
asked me how I could verify it's model year.  Obviously the registration date
of 1 Dec 1990 is not sufficient.

Can anyone help?

Subject: 911 Oil Leaks


   My 81' 911 is leaking a fair amount of oil near the transmission.  
   It has been suggested the idiot light switch or the "O" ring seal
   on the thermostat is the cause.  Lacking a good workshop manual,
   I have no idea where it is and the level of effort required to 
   fix the problem.  Can anyone out there enlighten me?

The "O" ring is definately a source of many annoying leaks. These
seals tend to dry out and get brittle. Replace with the new 
"red" colored one that lasts longer (supposedly).

The workshop manual wouldn't be of much help here either. You see
the manual always shows an engineer in a pressed snow white lab
coat working on the engine exterior from the car. To get your hands
on the thermostat "O" ring you have to lower the engine and reach
back. It is located about 4 inches right of center towards the
front of the engine. (All references assume front is towards front
of car). The idiot light sender is nearby.

Lowering the engine means remove the rear mounting bolts and swing
the drivetrain down about 6 inches to give clearance.

Also, the leak *might* be the engine main crank seal. This would
require the engine to be removed (Argh!).

I know that I'm not in your zone, but I'd like to get a copy of your 
rules also. I would like to get involved in auto-x, and I'm beginning to
plan on preparations. I'm going for a "lower" class an don't want to
be placed in a higher class unnecessarily. Example: One friend of mine
was placed in a modifed class because he had an exhaust header installed
on a stock engine. He was uncompetitive and outclassed, and if he knew

Pete,
According to my handy/dandy little Porsche 912 Spec Book (Stoddard sells these
for about $10 and they're jammed full of lots of good info; this 912 one also
covers 2.0L 911's), following is what it says about 912 generators and voltage
regulators. I'm not smart enough to tell you what it all means as to whether
it'll handle 100W headlight bulbs. Maybe some other Porschephiles can help.

**GENERATOR**
Output test load  =   300 watts/2500 rpm (generator armature)
Nominal voltage rpm  =  1850-2050 rpm (generator armature)
Field coil resistance  =  3.5 ohms
Brush spring pressure  =  450-600 p (p???)
420 watt generator

**VOLTAGE REGULATOR**
Closing voltage  =  12.4-13.1
Reverse current  =  2-7.5 amps
Switch contact gap (resting)  =  main contact 0.5-1.2 mm
regulating voltage at idle  =  w/o load=13.5-14.5 volts
                               w/load=12.8-13.8 volts

Hope this helps.

and the car once warmed up runs just under 180 F indicated.

In my owners manual (found one thru info from the net) below a chart

The easiest way is to sneak up on the unsuspecting driver-side A-pillar

(not year of manufacture).  K => 89, L => 90.

[for a 930]  Depending on the year of your car, you can save quite a bit
of money by simply buying wiring diagrams for that model year, and/or the
service manual or DME test plan for same.  For example, I have both the '85
944 Turbo and the '87 944S "DME test plan" manuals, which are twenty-odd
pages long and contain all the info you need to go after Motronic woes.
They are also a lot cheaper than the full workshop manuals.  These little
books also sometimes have neat tidbits of information not available in
the workshop manuals.  On the other hand, the workshop manuals' versions
of the test plans tend to get better updated by the supplements.

(I would have dug for specific part number for you, but you are not listed
in the Who's Who and so I don't have your model year.)

The rings and valves should find their homes in no more than a few hundred
miles.  Even during that time, I would not expect to see a lot of oil
smoke or heavy consumption.  Your oil temp sounds fine.

Sad to say, but PCNA/PAG's official "acceptable" oil consumption rates are
very generous and are chosen that way to avoid their having to repair
marginal motors under warranty.  Same sort of reason they deleted the magnet
from the oil drain plug a couple years ago.  The offical spec, if memory
serves, is something like one litre per thousand kilometers, which works
out to about a quart every six hundred miles, which is just this side of
absurd for street driving.

Depending on exactly how much you're consuming, you may want to have a
chat with the mechanic who did the work.  Could be something easy and
cheap to fix, like a loose/warped valve cover dripping on the exhaust or
heater boxes.  Or not.

Although the factory manuals are nice to have, I find they are not
essential to *most* repair operations. First of all, Porsche prints
very little info on each page, thus the Haynes 911 manual covers the
early manuals (up to '73) quite well. For specialized repairs like
your wiring or fuel injection get the appropriate supplements only
to save money. Also consider the parts fiches which tell you how
things go together and are better in some ways to the actual manual.

Are you using a synthetic oil to break in the motor? If you are then
DON'T because this can cause the rings not to seat properly. Once the
rings "seat" then you can use the synthetic regularly. 

Assuming you're using regular oil wait a few hundred miles more for
the rings to seat. 1 quart per 600 miles is O.K. according to Porsche
but I admit a bit disconcerting for a new motor. I had this problem
also (on a freshly rebuilt motor) that was behaving like a smoke 
generator. I eventually put in *another* set of rings and the thing 
worked great! It's still a mystery to me...

Greetings fellow members.  The following is 914 rust repair related;

I saved the best for last.  I am in deep do-doo.
Last nite at the shop ended with cutting an access into the battery side
lower rear suspension console.  I discovered pin holes and thin spots in
ominous places on this structure.  Closer inspection revealed 'steel coal'
within, which implies dangerously thin steel in an area that is subject to
severe stresses under use.
After 2 years of work, I cannot shirk now.  The part is 2.5 RCU's and is
available from Stoddard <this is not a problem>.  The problem is my ill-at-
ease sensation I get in reading book 8 (body) searching for information
on dimensions, procedures, etc.  The $300 set of manuals mention this
task as best done by a professional.  That does NOT meet my needs or original
intent for purchasing 'factory' manuals, reminds me of chilton or haynes!
   ** what am i? dog meat! **
Manual 8 does go into great detail on repair procedures and dimensions for
repairing collision damage, but sorely lacks any detail in regard to rust
excision and replacement (much less piecemeal style repairs).  I suppose
that would be asking too much of our German comrades, to think in terms
of the future and fate of their products.  Color photos and clear detailing
of circles and arrows (with a paragraph on the back of each one =8*>) would
be nice too, but maybe germany did'nt have color film in the 70's.
<end sarcasm>

 -Ok, so I can cook up a 'professional' technique to graft a new suspension
console onto my beleagered 914 and get within thousandths of the original
dimensions -bfd.  (It came to me in a dream last night).

Just in case someone out there has done this (to themselves), perhaps you
could illuminate my way, -else I will become the one to ask if someone out

Well since the car takes about 10 quarts to fill, that's not as bad as it
sounds at first.  Those numbers are like one a small engined car that take
3.5 quarts to fill, burning a quart in 1800 miles.  Right?

Or perhaps the hoses got connected wrong - a friend of mine had that

the air box, and it was steadily sucking oil up into the intake...
