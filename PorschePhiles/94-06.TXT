Subject: Advice on 944S2 and comments on 944 pedal height and brakes

A minor correction to a posting:  The 944 has 2-valve 2.5L engine -- 145-155HP
approx.  (The HP amount varied during different years, and I *think* the
displacement may have increased a little over the years.)  944S has 2.7L
4-valve approx 185HP.  944S2 has 3.0L 4-valve with 208HP.

Comment on 944 pedal height: I found the gas pedal height very poor for the
track, so I added a plate to the gas pedal which increases the height by
about 1 inch. This greatly improves heel&toe potential IMHO.

Comment on brakes: I use Cool Carbons and no fancy ducting and I have no
problem *ever* at the track. They are simply incredible for track use.
On the street the only negative is the squealing, which was very bad until I
put in the backing plates intended to quiet them. They are now acceptable.

I know that you can fit the early 928 phonedials (7x15) will fit on
the 924S and the late 931 (81-82).  And, they are cheap when you find
them, too!

Subject: Re:  Stuck odometer

Ah!  I've seen this on my 914.  I've done the fix/replace the gear
bit on VW odo's before, and was happy to see a metal gear in the 
odo from the 914.  I use a square rod in a hand drill to drive the
gears while on the bench so I can check the operation (if you have
an old busted cable, you've got the rod already).

After carefull inspection, the gear was simply riding on the shaft
rather than retaining the pressed fit.  As a solution, I removed
the gear (careful not to upset the rest of the machinery) and 
"peen"ed the center hole in two spots with a center punch.  Then
I simply pushed the gear back on the shaft, reassembled in the
reverse of disassembly, and tested it.

So far, this fix has held up for over five years, a trip across country
and back, and _lots_ of track time.

Subject: 944 checklist and comments on 911/928 ?

Hi,
Was just wondering if someone could send me a copy of the 944 pre-purchase
checklist.  It didn't seem too important at the time but I just talked to my
sister and it turns out she's looking at an '85 944 and might need some
pointers.
Along the same lines, I'm about to finish grad school and am looking at
getting a 911 ('79-'87) or 928 ('87->), assuming I find a decent job.  :)
I'm looking for information on performance, reliability, what to watch out
for, what impact the turbo has on the above, etc.  A comparison of the two
cars would also be great.  I'm sure this has been discussed too many times to
count so direct mail (or a pointer in the archives) would be fine.

Thanks,
Donn

Subject: Re: 944 Tire Pressures

Randy,

The pressure difference has always been rationalized to my ears per
your first suggestion: to avoid oversteer in panic situations.  The
seven pounds difference really is due to nothing more or less than
the fact that it's 0.5 bar, and Porsche's baseline spec's are always
given in bar.  By the way, they changed the pressure recommendations
as of the 944S2 in that series, to 33 front, 36 rear.

As you have found out, front/rear pressures within a few pounds of
each other are about right for 944's.  With street tires and their
relatively compliant sidewalls, you can get a reasonable idea of
the right pressure by chalking them.  However, the ideal way is to
use a pyrometer, and in fact it's the only way to measure things
meaningfully when using performance tires having really stiff side-
walls, like Yoko A008RS (II) or BFG Comp T/A R1.

You might also be interested to know that Porsche dropped the rear
sway bar size on the 944 Turbo around '88, from 16 to 14 mm. and
again quite clearly to deal with panic oversteer situations.  At
the same time, my factory 18 mm rear bar is on long-term loan to an
autocrossing friend who wanted a little more toss-ability in his
otherwise stock 944S2.

Subject: Re: Stuck odometer

You pretty much have it -- there's a nylon gear gizmo that's dead inside
your speedo head, and it's gotta get replaced. The real story is that
it was never designed for the extra drag that the trip odo puts on the
system, and hence is *very* likely to fail either as yours has with no
odo function period, or with no trip odo. 

The fix is straightforward, but involves sending your speedo head to an
authorized VDO shop. I use International Instrument in Houston, because
that's where my cars are, typically. Before I discovered them (actually,
"him" -- and old guy in a small shop with a *TON* of NOS parts...)
I used Palo Alto Speedo after a disasterous experience with the
Hollywood Speedo guys on a BMW motorcycle instrument cluster....

Contact info for all these guys are in the archives, probably in the
FAQ, and in the list that Trond sends around from time to time..

What really works great for pressing is a piece of the old bearing,
depending on its construction.  It's eaxctly the right size, and it's
obviously disposable.  This approach works well for installing rear
bearings.  And when tapping new CV's onto their halfshaft, you can
use the old CV's inner race between the hammer and the new CV.

Welcome!

First a general disclaimer:

Sorry for our poor english.
Everything written down here are our opinions, it has nothing to do with
our university.

End of disclaimer.

We'd like to introduce an anonymous FTP site of JPGs (and some GIFs,
etc.) about cars. Because this site is quite small, so only 10 users can
FTP simultaneously. You know, only a little PC with little Linux :-)
This site will carry pictures about limited edition cars, specialty cars
(kitcars, replicars, exotic sportscars etc.), radically modified cars,
coachbuilt production cars. I will store off-line the JPGs in TIF format
(whenever I could do...) so you can ask for it.

Only TIFF and TARGA - or any other truecolor, not compressed in a
lossy way - pictures are acceptable for uploading! We will publish it in
JPG format, but we should have it in the original truecolor not lossy
compressed format! Of course, there are always special cases, but please
do not bomb paul with such letters that I'd like to upload a JPG of my
beautiful VW Golf!  (If it is a Sbarro Golf - go ahead!). Well, we're
interested in _rare_ production cars e.g. 1953 Chevy Corvette, 1964 Ford
Mustang owners etc.  If you'd like to upload sg. you should write an
E-mail to 

PAUL@KTUD.ELTE.HU (he is the maintainer of the site)

and if he is interested in that picture, he'll write you the way of
uploading. Passwords are changed regurarly, so please upload
immediately when you've received the password! Please upload some
description of the car as detailed as it is possible! (History, technical
specifications, etc.). If you think you have an interesting car but you
don't have a scanner please drop us a line (ya know Paul@ktud.elte.hu)
and we will discuss it and if it's worth we'd be happy to scan it.

All the copyright problems will be sent back to the uploader. Nor I
(root), neither my brother (paul) is responsible for any (c) problems! 

This site is NOT:
1. A general picture site. (No sex, garfield, etc. junk pictures!!!!)
2. We are not interested in pictures scanned from books, brochures, etc.
   Paul is tryin' to avoid that kinda pix...

I'll try to keep up-to-date things like QPEG, JPG FAQ and such.

And maybe there will be a FAQ of cars-related stuff on the net (mailing lists,
WWWs, pic-sites etc.) (it's under construction now).

 
This part is for all the voters who got back their e-mail. I'd like to
explain what has happened in the last two weeks:

1. The building, where ktud (and ktud13) resides has got a new
backbone: FDDI ring. During the wiring, of course, there was no Net.

2. The leader of the faculty has not allowed to bring ktud to another
building. Sorry, he is my boss - I couldn't do anything.

3. Something has been scrambled with the mail system. I do not
understand exactly what has happened - and what has not - but the
results are clear: Your E-mail has come back with Host is unreachable
error.

4. I've had a very _important_ entrance exam on the 25th of May. So I've
had little time to deal with these things.

Sorry for the inconvenience,

                                 Charlie Negyesi

Rich, I just reread my message and saw a major typo. When I said "this

In re the checklists: are these something which we could have

   I was just getting ready to send the same messages I have taken my 914 
speedo apart for the same reason and found it very simple and i used a screw
driver to turn the shaft and you will see that the gear is spinning on the
shaft and not turning it.  Take the gear off and us a punch to put a flat
spot on the gear and press it back on the shaft.  The hardest part is opening
the speedo the first time you have to pry the ring that holds the glass in with
a small screwdriver.  This take time but I did the same repair and it has 
held up for over 2 year now..

this group using Genie and I know zip about the rest of this wide world.
  While waiting for all the paperwork for my new camera store, I've been
'playing' at a friends business.  He owns a Buick/Pontiac store and came up
with an idea to move more cars, that is, sell them at fleet prices to the
members of the computer world.  They could be drop shipped to a local dealer
solving that problem. On the surface, this sounds like a good idea to me
since it would probably save folks some bucks, and of course boost his
sales.  Now, I realize they are not Porsches but since most of us drive
other cars....
   BTW, I won't be involved with this if it takes off, my new store should
be open by the 15th or so.

Steve:

Those words "leak proof" scare the heck out of me. Sort of like saying "my
car never breaks down" as you embark on a long road trip, or "Quantas never
crashes" as your plane takes off for Australia.

Maybe the Maestro will post his published text on the subject...well...maybe
not...but as I recall the thinking goes something like this: When the case is
bolted together at the factory and upon subsequent disassembly/reassembly,
the mating surface around the bolts becomes slightly distorted. If you use a
machinists stone to remove the distortion you will approximated a "factory"
fit between the mating surfaces, thereby greatly increasing your odds of
putting together a "no-leak" case. As soon as you take your stone to the
case, said distortion magically appears as a shiny ring around the bolt
holes. It will still leak in the other leak prone spots (push rod tubes, main
and pulley seals, valve covers...) unless you follow proper procedures in
those places as well.

I now find myself applying this technology in all sorts of situations where
one thing gets attached to another...with remarkable results.

Experience, anyway: when I first got my 1971 914, the odometer was
inoperative. The first time I exceeded 100mph, it began working
and continued working throughout the rest of my mostly-quite-pleasureable

Bill,
I have a 90 C4 and it measures 27.25 inches front and 25.5 inches in the back 
from the ground to the fender lip.  Probably settle down a bit after all these 
years.  

I would like to at least lower the front end but according to Stan, he said 
that the progressive springs are not really desirable for my C4.  I'm still 
trying to figure what is the best approach to lower my car but haven't found 
out what is best yet.  Let me know what you end up doing.

You do know that the 911's front end is higher than the rear end because the 
US law requires that the headlights to be a certain minimum height.

From the Who's Who list, I assume you are asking about switches for
928s.  I installed a low temp switch a few months ago after the stock
switch in my 951 went bad.  The comments below may therefore only
apply to these models, but I would guess 928s are probably similar.

>DQ- Is it in contact with the coolant or just sensing

The switch does contact the coolant, so your best (least messy) bet is
therefore to drain the radiator.

>Anybody have one install with comments of results/replacement?

My temp gauge seems to be spending less time in the upper part of the
"normal" range than it used to, but it is hard to do a good controlled
experiment to see what kind of difference it really makes.  I am
waiting for some warmer weather to see if I find myself doing any less
gauge-watching in stop-and-go traffic.

Replacement was pretty easy in my 951 using a 1-1/8" socket.  I was
surprised to see that the factory manual advises removing the fan
assembly to do this job, since this is totally unnecessary.  It was
the only time I can remember the factory manual making a job seem more
difficult than it really is (it's usually the other way, of course).

Care needs to be taken not to overtorque the switch and crack the
plastic radiator (don't know if 928 radiators are plastic or not).  As
I recall, the manual specified something like 20 Nm, but I did not
even go that high (basically just "snugged" it down a bit, figuring
that it would be easier to tighten it some more if a leak developed
than to replace the radiator).

Good luck,
Milo

Bob,

A couple of years ago, I had my muffler sandblasted, painted it with
red rust-inhibiting primer, and then painted it with high-temperature
paint (not sure of the brand-name, but it came in the spray cans with
the flame logo on the label).  Two years later the muffler is a bit
corroded and doesn't look very pretty, but it's not rusted.  It's not
real pretty, but I figure it's in better shape than if I hadn't
painted it.  (Of course, that paint won't do anything for rust on the
inside of the muffler.)

For the heat exchangers, the epoxy powder paint on my heat exchanger
boxes is holding up just fine.  


If I remember correctly, the engine featured on the cover of one of
Harry Pellow's books has a muffler that was coated using aluminum
plasma-arc spraying.  Can anyone report on how well that kind of
muffler coating holds up?  I checked into getting my muffler treated
the same way, but the guy at the plating shop simply said that I
didn't want to know the price!

I'm a pretty relaxed guy so I don't get worked up easily but I can
understand why 356-loyalists are so vocal, Ted.

When the 911 was introduced in Geneva in 1963 the automobile world
generally loved it.  Porsche loyalists (ie, 356 lovers), however, were very
cool to it.  "It isn't a real Porsche."  "It doesn't have 4 cylinders."  "The
classic shape has been forever tarnished."  Etc.  We've seen similar stuff
with the 914 ("VW engine, brakes, assembly, .."), watercooled cars
("Horrors!"), even the borrowed Carrera name ("Real Carreras are twin
cams, ...").  Okay.  We're passionate people.  We get excited.

But let's remember our roots, Ted.  Have you ever driven a 356?  If you
haven't, you probably don't really know what's so special about a Porsche.
You are driving an evolved 911 which has good similarities to the original
Porsche, but just what about that 911 is really characteristic?.  You
haven't experienced it.  It's not about speed (Porsches were never
especially fast), not about handling (lots of cars corner better), not about
eliteness, cost, luxury, etc.  It's about the indescribable joy of driving and
caring for a car designed for a different breed.  Porsche engineers came up
with an amazingly successful recipe: build a reasonably affordable, light
sports car that's fun to drive and ready to race.  Design it so it is easy to
repair, and build it with long lasting, high quality components.  With the
356 we got the distinctively-shaped Porsche car that knocked the socks
off the competition in just about every kind of race there was.  And then
got driven home and rebuilt by the hobbyist.

The 356 prices are very high, I agree.  But why?  Because people are
willing to pay a lot for so special a car.  Porsche no longer sets the price
for 356's.  We do.

Thankfully the 911 is enough like the 356 to make even the newest ones
a little bit like them.  And I'll admit, I don't mind a little acceleration and
some taming of that famous oversteer.  But I still lust for a 356 and I'll
probably pay the price.

A feature of the oil level gauge/sender design is that a poor contact 
in the sender causes the gauge reading to indicate high.

This can be simulated by pulling the lead off the sender and watching
the needle peg high.

In my 72 911T, there was a slightly degraded contact to the oil level sender
output tab.  This caused the oil level gauge needle to be offset to a false
high reading.   The needle wasn't pegged and it fluctuated, so the sender/gauge
looked ok, and I thought the car had plenty of oil.  The dip stick indicated
otherwise.

Taking the sending unit out of the tank and soldering the internal connection
fixed the problem.  

For safety,  periodically recheck the 911 oil level indicator with a dip stick
measurement.

P.M.Katz sounds miffed by null response to his request for a 911 check list.
I believe it's just that to get beyond the generic list Katz provided (which
is itself a useful structure for comparison) you jump more or less immediately
to book length -- and the books are already written:
BK-684 (Porter and Morgan) 34.95
BK-416 (Batchelor) 23.95
VT-890 (videotape) 39.95 [I was disappointed in this; thought they would take
better advantage of the available bandwidth, e.g. tape does NOT include seg-
ments on "don't buy a car that sounds like this ..."]
BK-2178 (Anderson) 18.95 [This is not laid out as a used car guide, but has 
great detail on year-to-year changes; rewards careful notetaking on what year
of 911 you want to look for, then use other lists to distinguish between the
various examples you look at]

(code numbers and prices from Automotion catalog)

Having said all that, I think a jointly developed file of Frequently Noted
Flaws, similar to Frequently Asked Questions, would be a great addition to the
net resources.  For example:

oil leak at front of engine

could be: (1) oil cooler (especially if leak favors passenger side); engine 
does not need to come out, but can't be repaired, must be replaced
(the oil cooler, not the engine)
(2) oil cooler seals (somewhat unusual; usually if they are ever tight, they
are always tight; engine does not need to come out)
(3) senders and seals at top front of engine (engine does not need to come out,
but induction system may, unless you have extra elbows)
(4) crankshaft oil seal (easy fix except engine needs to come out)
(5) ...

Alternatively, someone could read the archives, capture all the FNF content
without plagiarizing any specific wording, and write a great book.  If only
I didn't have to spend so much time in this damn office!

Subject: More on 914 shocks


Following up on a thread a few weeks ago about rear shocks and springs for a 
914...

I bought a set of Boge automatics for my '75 914 earlier this spring and I 
am finally
getting the time to install them.  My problem is that the Boge shocks did 
not come with
new rubber bump stops and mine are completely shot.  Calling around, the 
only places
that I have found that carry replacements are Stoddard - $34.10 a piece 
(currently out
of stock) and Automobile Atlanta - $42 a piece (in stock).  Note that the 
bump stop
costs about half the price of the shock itself!  (Anyone have any other 
sources for
bump stops?)

I believe that KYB and Koni shocks come with new bump stops.  Had I known 
this
earlier I probably would have bought KYBs.  (And as Stan said, KYBs are 
generally
less expensive than Boges.)  I originally chose Boge since I am happy with 
the
stock ride.

Something to keep in mind when calculating the total cost of replacing 
shocks.

Subject: Re: 944 Tire Pressures

Randy,

FWIW, on my '87 944 Turbo (951) the tire pressures are spec'd as 36psi front
and rear, and this car originally came with 205/55-16s on the front and
225/50-16s on the rear. And Kevin mentioned that they made the rear sway bars
smaller after '87, so there seems to be a pattern of continuous tweeking
going on even by the factory.

The moral is: you should feel free to try your own 'tuning'. Its been said by

Subject: Pocono event report (long)

This past weekend, NNJR held its driver ed event at Pocono Raceway in Long 
Pond, PA.  Luckily, I was able to finish my car in time for the event. On 
Saturday, it was windy and cold which was good for the turbocharged cars. 

There were 213 cars running, so 3 runs were planned each day.  Some 
interesting cars were: an RS 3.8, several race-ready 911s, a Kremer 911, a Ruf 
Turbo, a Carrera Cup 911, an RS America and the usual assortment of 944 
Turbos, 914s, 914/6s and even 1 356, 1 928 and 1 924. 

We ran the double infield instead of the boring tri-oval which Nascar runs. 
 There were enough turns to keep it interesting but some folks were seeing 120 
on the back and main straights.  I kept it down on purpose and concentrated on 
learning the correct line through the turns.  One over-zealous young man 
insisted on trying for top-speed honors and resulted in using up his brakes.  
The pedal went to the floor on the back straight.  Fortunately, he was able to 
limp back to the pits using engine braking.  I left early since I didn't have 
flagging duty and missed the main incident of the day.  While exiting the last 
turn before Front Straight, the driver of a 911 Carrera was going a little too 
fast and was heading for the wall.  She then made the classic mistake of 
lifting.  The 911 spun violently, impacted the concrete wall which got it 
airborne, burst into flames and hit the wall again before coming to rest.  The 
fire truck and ambulance were only yards away.  The instructor stumbled out 
but the driver was unconscious when they pulled her out.  They were checked 
out at a local hospital, no broken bones, they're both fine.  The safety cage 
and harnesses did their job and the passenger cell was intact but the 911 gave 
itself up. 

I heard the report of what happened on Sunday and it was very sobering to know 
what could happen.  The moral of the story is: if you want to play, invest in 
the safety equipment.  Harnesses are high on my list of priorities.  A Nomex 
suit is probably not a bad idea. 

On Sunday, the course was changed to include the Bowl which is banked sharply. 
 This was a different experience going in at 90-100 and accelerating all the 
way through the huge banked curve. 

I rode with Ken Geiger (NNJR Pres.), in his SCCA/PCA Race 914 (2.4L 4cyl).  It 
was a wild, incredible ride.  I have new respect for the 914.  It was pulling 
1.25g on the turns and 150 on the straight with huge Bremteks (panic, panic: 
when is he going to brake) which really slow you down quickly.  The Koenig 
seats coupled with the harnesses really lock you in place.  I learned a few 
things just watching him. 

My instructor signed me off and then I not only had to remember when to shift 
and brake but I had to look for the flaggers!   That was the instructor's job! 
:)  

All-in-all, a very fun weekend!  Looking forward to Watkin's Glen.

Subject: wheel offsets 911

Some questions on wheel offsets:

 1.  What exactly is the wheel offset? Is it the horizontal distance from
the centerline of the wheel width to the mounting surface of the
wheel?  If so, does a zero offset have the wheel centered over the mounting
surface?  As the offset increases, which way does the outside of the
wheel move relative to the hub?

 2.  When looking at the markings on a factory fuch wheel, which
marking is the offset?  Is it the number stamped after the "ET"
below the wheel size?  Or is it embedded somewhere in the 
Porsche part number?

3.  I've been told by a couple of sources that I can use a 225/45-16 tire
on the front of an 84-89 911 carrera, without sheet metal work
if I use a 7"x16 fuch from an
86 944 turbo to replace the 6"x16 fuch that is on the car.
I've been told that  the 7"x16  fuch that is on the
rear of the 84-89 carrera will not work with a tire larger than a 205/55-16
since its offset will not provide the clearance from the outside of the tire
to the inside of the front fender and that  the 86 944 turbo wheel has a different
offset that moves the edge of the rim closer to the mounting surface
of the hub. What is the offset of this 944 turbo wheel?  What is the offset of
the 7" wheel from the rear of the carrera?  What is the offset of the
6"x16 fuch that is on the carrera currently. 
If I use the 944 turbo wheels, can I use a 225/50-16
as well, or do I need the 45 series for the lower tire height to clear the
fender as the suspension compresses?


thanks

Pete

When you have all quite finished bad mouthing English auto engineering for

you where most of the Indy Car and Formula 1 development comes from these 
days (not to mention the Corvette ZR1 engine ( the supposed "heartbeat of 
America")) Yes - most of it happens in England - Lola chassis are built 
there, Both Ford Cosworth and GM engines for Indy Cars come from there as do 
Judd engines, In fact last year Scott Goodyear claimed to be the only All 
American car racing in the Indy series. in F1,  the Wiiliams Renault chassis 
is designed and built there, The McClaren also, Even Ferrari have a place in 
Woking Surrey, in fact most of the F1 teams are based in England, not 
Europe, Japan or South America.  I also heard on Sunday that the Mercedes 
Engine that won the 500 was developed -you got it  - in the UK.

Add to that, that a good percentage of the Engineering teams and Pit Crews

Subject: Re:  wheel offsets 911

Pete,

On a '78 to '89 911 you can use 8" wheels on the front and 9" wheels
on the rear. To do this, you need to get a pair of 944 Turbo 8" Fuch
wheels. Their part number starts with "951.". On these wheels you
will want to put 225/45R16 tires. I have been told that 225/50R16
will work, but they are not ideal. On the rear you use the 911 Turbo
9" Fuch wheel and you put 245/45R16 tires on them. This combination
fills up the wheel wells quite well and you do not have to change
any sheet metal. The 944 Turbo 8" Fuch adds almost the whole inch
to the inside of the wheel well.

I suppose you could use the 7" 944 Turbo wheel and use 225/45R16
tires on the front but the 225mm wide tire fits much better on an
8" wheel.

My '78 911SC Targa is set up as I described in the first paragraph.
It was no problem doing it and my car is quite low. It is nice
having more rubber than a stock '88 911 Turbo!!

The guy that set my car up this way has done at least 30 911s this
way and has yet to have a problem. I went to an autocross school
recently and had no problems with clearence. I know someone that
has a pair of these 8x16 wheels, brand new in the box, for $600.
Let me know if you are interested. By the way, this is a very
good price! I am not affiliated with guy at all, by the way.

Well!

The following is the list I made up for shopping for my 944.  It is mostly
just hints and tips I picked up from 944-owning friends and magazine articles.
It's nowhere near complete, but was instead intended to steer me clear of the
"gotcha" cars.  I'm happy to submit it for group editorial comment and revision.
Since I've only been a Porsche owner since, ummm, last Tuesday, I'm sure there
are many people who could provide more significant commentary! :)

Some general comments:
   I have an '87 944S.  The owner's manual recommends 36psi front and rear.
   The 944S models were (are!) 2.5L DOHC and produce 188 US BHP.
   I believe the salesman who sold me the car told me the sway bars (I have
   the "sport" suspension) are 16mm front and 21mm in back.  I have *no idea*
   if this is correct, or even reasonable.  Junk food for thought...

Also, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions as to replacement
speakers.  I looked yesterday, and found out that 4x6 is probably the most
unpopular speaker size for which speakers are available.  I have 4 4x6 speakers.
Should I bite the bullet and enlarge the holes in the doors, or can anyone
recommend a source for good-sounding speakers?

*   Take cover off timing belt for inspection.
*   Start engine a few times to check for initial vibration and starter

*   While engine is idling, hold shifter and check for vibration.  Bad vibes
    could mean motor mounts are going, or clutch disk is failing.  If the
    vibration gets worse when you rev the engine, have the clutch inspection
    plate pulled and look for rubber fragments.
*   Check ignition wires for cracks.
*   Check fuel system for leaks.
*   On turbo models, let the engine warm up and check for smoke under

Ummmmm. You just did something bad... *ANY* CIS system that has been used
and has not been kept running is probably bad. The little tiny passages
in the fuel distributor are *VERY* prone to corrosion and since that 
changes the displacement of the valving passages, tends to break the unit.
You can *ONLY*  use new, sealed units, or units taken from running cars
that have not been removed and the internals exposed to the air

Sorry to be what my niece calls "the bear of bad news"...

As an aside, note this is *NOT* true for DME systems, although you may

Compression involves using a gauge with a schraeder valve allowing air
to flow from the engine to the gauge to let you meassure the compression
of the air coming from the engine. If you know the compression ratio
for the engine, then the max value should be (compression ratio - 1)*14.5.
Minimum should be about 90% of that value. Difference between high and low
cylinder should be no more than 10%.

Leakdown involves a gauge with a schraeder valve allowing air to flow from
the outside (a compressor) into the the engine. You then pressurize the 
cylinder to some nominal value (say 150psi) and see how much air it leaks
over a 5 minute period. Good is 2-3%, acceptible is under 10%, more than 
that and it's rebuild time. This also allows you to listen to the engine
and see what's whistling (i.e. where the leak is -- valves, rings, 
hole in piston, etc.)

So it's the same, but different. Gotta do both to have a clear picture of
what's up with the engine

shim of some sort to make it more even with the brake pedal the above 
desribed heel and toe method won't work for you.  I got that idea from an 
in-car camera from a NASCAR road course event that highlighted toe and 
heel technique during the race.  

TV coverage gets better all the time - too bad the foreign networks can't 
figure out how to provide decent coverage for Forumala One - thdy miss

Good Luck.

Subject: 911 rear wheel bearings done

 -fairly long-

Well, I tackled the rear wheel bearings on Memorial
Day and got the job done. It wasn't too bad (with a
few exceptions which I'll note)

Thanks to the 4 or 5 people who provided excellent 
advice, including the advice to wear black underwear!
I think I got as dirty as I've ever been in my life.

I decided to take the trailing arms off, because I had
access to a hydraulic press and because I bought 
Weltmeister bushings for the chassis end. (pretty nice
of me since I'm selling the car, right?)

Disassembly was straightforward - basically take every-
thing off. One helpful hint from the shop manual is that
if you hold the brake pedal down (they have a special
tool, but I used a piece of wood) the brake fluid 
reservoir won't drain. It saves time bleeding the brakes
later.

I did break an S&K socket getting the big nuts off the
rear hubs - Off to Sears on Memorial Day to get a 
replacement. I didn't have a pipe that would fit over
my breaker bar, so I used 5 screw-type hose clamps to
clamp a 6ft pipe to my breaker bar. It sounds squirly,
but it worked great and stayed nice and tight.

I used a large socket and heavy hammer to pound out the
old bearings, then pressed the new ones in with the 
hydraulic press. It was very easy. (I didn't use the 
press to get the old ones out because positioning was
awkward and it wasn't worth the time for set-up)

The hardest part was re-connecting the parking brake
cables. One side went together without a hitch, but the
other side was a bear. The little "butterfly" spreader
kept falling out of place. If I held pressure on it with
the cable, I didn't have a hand free to slip the outside
spreader on and put the washer and nut on. After an hour
of doodling with it, I finally got a helper to provide
a third hand. Any one out there have an easier way to 
do this? Maybe a hemostat clamp or something?

The upper bushings were a piece of cake, as one of the
posters said it would be. Basically, pry the old ones
out with a big screwdriver and tap the new ones in with
a plastic or rubber hammer.

In summary, it was a dirty job, but not too difficult
for someone with a good set of tools and a day to kill.
For me, it's a lot more fun than playing golf!

Thanks again to the Porschephiles who provided excellent
advice.

 - Reid

Subject: Re: Stuck Speedometer

Just another piece of info on the 914/pre-75 911 VDO speedometers:
  I've done the punch trick on the metal gear for at least 4 speedometers.  I
also scrape up the shaft where the gear rides, e.g. by rotating it in the grip
of a pair of pliers.  Never had a problem since then.  When you remove the
faceplace, just pry up the lip on the bezel for about half the circumference -
this allows you to get it off, but makes a tight fit when you get it back on.

Another mode of failure I just dealt with: the drive shaft with the magnet at
the end of it sheared at the top of its threads which drive the odometer.
Symptoms are that the speedometer cable turns, but you get no odometer movement
and no speedometer reading.  At first I thought I had broken the speedo cable.

Turns out the shaft is the same in the 914 and 911 speedometers, and since
914 speedometers are more plentiful...  BTW none of the other gears are the
same.  This is odd since as far as I could tell the final drive ratio (at
the differential, which drives the speedo drive gear) is the same between the
914 and 911, and the tire circumference is very nearly the same.  Maybe the
drive gears are different.

I also replaced the needle while I was at it, after having the speedo cable
stick one morning and then let go - pegging the needle an entire turn around
and sending it past the stop so it wouldn't return to normal.  Chipped the
paint off the needle...  Anyways, there are calibration marks on the side
lip of the speedo faceplace, around where you would extrapolate 0mph to be.
The idea is to set the needle at zero, lift it up over the stop so it rests
at 10mph with some tension, and then go out and time yourself using mile
markers.

Pete asks, among other things:
>...'What exactly is the wheel offset? Is it the horizontal distance from
the centerline of the wheel width to the mounting surface of the
wheel?...'<

Barney replies:
The latest AUTOMOTION catalog, page 13, contains the following "Tech Tip".

"Wheel offset is a term used to describe the difference between the plane
of the mounting surface of the wheel and its inner and outer rims. Porsche
wheel offset is measured in terms of 'backspacing'. This is the depth from
the wheels mounting flange to the inner rim edge. Find your wheels'
backspacing by placing the wheel face down; laying a straight-edge across
the wheel rim (not the tire); and measuring down to the mounting flange.
The smaller the depth measurement, the more outboard the wheel will be on
the car."

FYI, the backspacing on almost all 911 Fuchs wheels is 125mm or
approximately 4 7/8". I ran a pair of 944 7" rims on the front of my
Carrera and still had some fender rub.

Hope this helps.

Jay,

The way I understand it is this:

The harder you brake, the more you trade energy for heat.  

Cool Carbons are apparently constructed to try to keep
heat from transferring from the pad to the caliper and, 

hence, the brake fluid.  They do not cause less heat at
the rotor.  In fact, they create MORE heat at the rotor
due to the amount of friction the pad and rotor surface 

have under pressure.  The Cool Carbons are supposed to be
able to take more abuse and wear slower than OEM pads by
maintaining function over a greater heat range.  That
is their primary benefit.

P-netters,
        With all this talk of wheel offsets and what size wheels will
fit what size cars, I've begun thinking of changing the size wheels and
tires on mine.
        I have a 1970 911 with 6J x 15 Fuchs with 185SR78's (I know, OLD).
What is the widest wheel and tire I can mount without flaring the 
wheel wells?  Also, can I go to a 16" wheel, say 7 x 16?  I'd like
to stay with Fuch's, but if need be, I could put some other wheel
on the car, e.g. BBS, Centerline, etc.
        Thanks for any ideas or help you can lend.

Well I'm back from Jamaica.  Time to start working on my '73 911S.  It was fun
in Jamaica, but all I kept thinking about was my Porsche.  Boy are these cars
addictive.  Anyway, I've inspected my car a bit more and have some more 
questions for you Early 911 owners.

1.  Still have to fix my headlights.  I tried cleaning the fuse contacts,but
    I still have no lights.  Several of you mentioned some relays may be bad.
    Can you tell me where they are located?

2.  All of my interior lights are out, except the gauge lights.  Also the trunk
    light is out.  Any suggestions?  All my fuses look good.


3.  I found a plastic container in front of my front left tire, under the fender    Can someone tell me what this is?


4.  The leather on the section of my dash, directly below the glove compartment
    is separating from the dash.  I want to spray some trim adhesive to glue it
    back on to the dash.  It is separating because I guess over the years of 
    opening and closing the glove compartment door, the bottom of the door
    rubbed on the leather and it finally started separating from the dash.
    
    Does anyone know if this section of the dash can be removed separately or
    do I have to just do the best job I can spraying the adhesive behind the 
    leather and applying pressure to adhere it to the dash?


5.  The targa top material needs to be replaced.  Is this a job I can tackle
    myself or is it best left to a targa top restorer?  I noticed that 
    Automotion sells the material for around $160.           


I have more questions, but I don't want to flood the net all at once.
Thanks.

Looks like some numbers in the list below are DIN, while others are

(engine internal aerodynamic mods), then to the the 162 (SAE/DIN?) for the 2.7.

The US 924S always had the 143/147 SAE engine.

I thought the 944S was 2.5 always, but if you've got true factual

The pressure difference depends on how hot you get the tire vs. when 
you measured it "cold".

You should adjust the hot pressures for correct handling.  The common, 
quick response of "more air gives understeer" or oversteer isn't fully 
correct.  There is an optimum point for handling (the way you and/or 
the car likes it); too low *or* too high makes the car handle wrong.  
It's jus a bell curve, really.

Set the F/R bias and the total pressures for your needs.  Then, 
throughout the day, bleed the tires back down to this value as they 
heat.  Lunch or flagging breaks throw things off, of course.

It is safe and very practical, both for the cam nut and cam bolt
designs.  You do have to have a feel for how tight the fastener is getting
as it goes on, which an experienced soul will have.

Personally, I'm OK taking stuff off with an air gun.  I hate and avoid

Vehicle Craft Inc. (VCI) sells them.  They advertize in Pano, at least
as one of the "bullets" in the Cool Carbon ad.  Depending on which
callipers you have, you can also get them from Porsche.

They don't dissipate heat any better, per se.  What they have is a
ceramic liner which insulates the calliper, reducing heat flow into
fluid.  The carbon/kevlar pad material also has a lower conductivity
(right word?).  The heat that doesn't go into the calliper either
stays in the pad a little longer, and/or flows out via the rotor.

My point would be that, because they afford greater braking, you'll
on balance make more brake heat and have a worse problem.  I think.

Jay,

Not a problem.  I too see six to eight pounds increase after a run group.

Here's what I hope is the right way to think about this.  As soon as you
warm you tires (a lap or two at speed), they will reach their operating
temperature and so pressure, and will stay there for the rest of your
time on the track.  What you want to do is set the pressures "cold" such
that they're right when they get "hot."  So cold temp's are pretty
irrelevant; it's the hot ones that count.

Think about a track which is mostly right-hand corners, like Lime Rock.
You'll end up heating the left side tires more, and that will show up
when you take pyrometer readings.  In this sort of case, it is common
to put a little stagger in the tire pressures.  At Lime Rock, that might
mean cold pressure in the right side which are a pound or two higher than
the left.

I disagree with what Jim said about bleeding pressures down during the
course of the day.  The right thing to do is set them once per pyrometer
readings, and leave them alone.  That typically means starting the day
with a guess-timate, coming in as hot as possible after a few laps,
having a friend ready in pit road to do pyro readings, adjusting pressures,
then partying the rest of the day.  No matter how long between run
groups, and so no matter the cooling, you will have the right amount of
air in your tires once they're warmed up next run group.

I would not be too focused on absolute pressure numbers or changes,
except if those changes pushed you above the safe operating pressure for
your tire.  This is pretty unlikely in any Porsche, but I think it can
be an issue in other cars, esp. front-wheel drive.  Focus on even
temperatures across the tire face, indicating correct pressure and
alignment.  The absolute temp's also indicate how hard you're working
the tires, of course.

Hope this helps.

Kevin

Subject: Re: 944 shopping list

Here's a few tips for sound system upgrades on a 944:  Instead of the 
unpopular 4x6 speakers (which don't sound very good anyway), try looking 
into a set of surface mount high-end types (i.e. Advent) that only sticks 
the magnet down into the door cavity.  These may not fit when the door 
closes, but it's worth a try.  As an alternative, since the stock speakers 
in the back are pretty difficult to get to and any upgrades to the front 
may be pretty negligble anyway, you may want to put a "tube" behind the 
rear seat. It can easily be removed, and it fills out the sound nicely.
Good Luck

I had new brake pads fitted (Repco Metalmasters, seem nice) recently,
and now I have a fairly subdued but noticeable clunk seemingly from
the right rear when I get on the brakes sharply. It's only an initial
noise, and the brakes seem fine in steady state. Are there any
suggestions from the net? I'll probably take off the wheel this weekend
to look, but would appreciate advice on what is most likely. Calipers,
pads themselves, CV joints? Thanks. Since I'm on the digest, I'd appreciate

Tracy,

Rich Inferra (Rich's Car Tunes in Watertown, Mass) did the sound system for
my '87 951 (back in 1987). Originally we were going to put in the ADS 320i
system from my previous car. What I learned from Rich (who has a truly
encyclopaedic knowledge of cars and what fits in them) is that in '87 Porsche
changed the window tracks so that there is less room behind the speaker area.
This precluded mounting the woofers of the wonderful 320is (sniff, sob...) so
we ended up with Blaupunkt speakers which are a coaxial design (these are the
same speakers used in the rear by the factory in '87). We then mounted ADS
300ci "box" speakers on removable tethers in the back hatch area for some
reasonable bass.

If you are REALLY after a truly high end sound system for the 944S, you might
consider trying to find the special door panels with baffles which the
factory offered (I think starting in '88) as an option. It replaces the map
pocket area with a baffle allowing a deeper woofer magnet to clear the window
tracks.

Unfortunately, as Rich told me, "if high end car audio is your goal, the 944
isn't really the best platform". 

Hope this helps...

Mike,

I have an '86 951 (with, I think, identical brakes) and have used Metal
Masters much of the last three years. They are excellent pads but are
harder than the original equipment ones. I was able to hear each of the
calipers grab the disk with a clunk when I hit the brake just right
(quickly but without much pressure). Kind of a neat thing really to be able
to hear your calipers grab the disk... Hope this is your "problem" too.

As for other pads, DS-11's make even more of a clunk. They also suffer from
a backing plate that is slightly too small for the caliper and rattle badly
when driving around town over anything but a *very* smooth road. Sadly,
they also don't work very well on the track; they require a narrow
temperature range to work their best (*much* narrower than Metal Masters).
I would not recommend these pads to anyone for any purpose.

My next set of pads are the Cool Carbons (I know I'm way behind the times,
but I had to use up a stockpile of old pads...). I will try these for the
first time at the Niagara Watkins Glen event - June 13-14. I'm also going
to try a set of R1 tires for the first time. My Yoko A008G tires are
finally showing significant wear after 3 years and 30+ track days...

Hope this helps.

~ often enough to have the right feel for things.  Maybe some day...

As a good interim step, try one of the small "butterfly" impact drivers.
Mine has a thumbwheel that lets me adjust the torque from "almost none"
to "moderate."  I haven't measured what top torque is, but it's almost
certainly less than 40 lb-ft.  This is indispensible for such tasks as
replacing the sump cover (well, on cars that have them :-), where you
have 20-odd 1/4" bolts that only go on to 5 lb-ft or so; set the butterfly
to 0 or 1 and just speed things along, then snug everything down later as
required.  The downside is that this driver won't remove high-torque
components, so you'll still need a heavy-duty air gun.  But for fine
work (and also for tight work, as the butterfly is about the size of
a squared-off can of Coke, with the drive lug coming out one end), it's
been a source of admiration and delight.

Of course, I haven't had my compressor long, but I've used it a LOT --
done the suspension on a friend's car and the engine on mine.  If there's
anyone out there who spends more than, oh, two nights a month working on
cars, GET A COMPRESSOR.  It's the second easiest way to get work done on
cars -- the first being, of course, money.

Tom,
  I have a '77 911s, but I believe the '69 to '77 911s have the same 
bodies, with exception of turbo and some euro/rs models.

I have 7x15 BBS RA front wheels with 195/60 * 15 tires, I've also had 
205/60s on front with no problems.

I have 7x16 BBS RA rear wheels with 195/50 * 16 tires, the previous tires 
(205/50) on the same wheels rubbed.

Most recommendations are to stay with the 15" wheels on this body style, 
but some people have successfully put 16" wheels with the correct offsets 
and low profile narrow tires on this body style.

I plan to try a set of 16" factory Fuchs on my '77 911s, and hope they 
don't rub.

No, this is a carbon canister for gas vapors. There's one in the
luggage compartment by the left battery (oval) and one out in the
fender, up behind the headlight. The washer bottle in '73's is in
front of the spare tire on the left side, and the filler comes up

Have you considered an aftermarket steering wheel. Even though a stock 
steering wheel would look more stock, the Momo and Fittipaldi wheels look 
really nice. If you shop around in Excellence or European Car, I think that 
you could get a new black leather Momo MonteCarlo with the hub and horn 
button for under $200. They look and feel good, and I know people who have 
replaced perfectly fine stock steering wheels with them. You can also get 
them in various colors, suede, leather, or vinyl and with contrasting 
stitching if that is your inclination. While I have never replaced a 911 
steering wheel, the only time I saw it done, it required a 24mm or 27mm 
socket, extension bar, and 3 minutes. This happened in a 911 Turbo while it 
was being driven! (switch wheels at the light, tighten socket when the car 
is going straight)

Subject: Re:  928 warnings?

$11.5K for a 928 may be about right if its' a 928, not a 928S or -S4.
928S's are running about $15K (+/-) and a 928 is older... so it may
be in the ballpark. Even if you don't know the exact model year, you
can get close with this: Does it have a small lip spoiler on the back? If 
so, 928S. Does it have a wing across the back? 928S4. No spoiler? 928.
(I know, this assumes it hasn't been changed by owner...)

Things to look for: electrical problems top the list. Make sure all the
electrical stuff works well. The 928 family has a *LOT* of electronic
gizzies (my wife's word) and when they start going, look out! Can be
very tough to find/fix.

In truth, I've had so few problems with my '86 I feel blessed. The thing
just runs and runs. It is expensive to run, a 5-liter engine is not 
a econobox, and maintenance can be expensive. But all in all the machine
is very well made and goes very fast.

Thanks for the responses to my earlier set of questions.  Here are some
more:

My 911S has silver colored emblems on the engine lid instead of black.  I

black air intake grill and black 'targa' emblems on the roll bar.  Mine
are all silver. 


My sunvisors are dying.  The vinyl is detaching from the foam.  They look
inflated.  What can I do?


My car has a lock for the engine lid that is embedded in the inside portion
of the left rear bumper.  Was this a special option in '73?


I have the Recaro Sport seats.  Are the headrests removeable?  They don't
seem to be.

For early 911's this is the gas tank "vent chamber".  The washer bottle is
located in the front trunk next to the latch, recessed somewhat.

The location is taken by the washer bottle on later models (74 on?).

I have not had experience with the other shops mentioned.  But 
I like CarreraTech in Campbell.  Aside from the more common reasons
like honest, friendly and knowledgeable,  I like them for the 
following reasons:

  1) They cleaned the area of my car they worked on.  I was pretty
     impressed with how clean the general area was around tensioners
     when I had my car updated with the Carrera tensioners.

  2) They allow me to buy my own parts for them to install.  This 
     saved me a lot of money.  (I asked another reputable mechanic
     in the bay area if I could bring my own parts, and he literally
     told me to do the job myself.) 

  3) The mechanics work on a salary, so there is less incentive for them 
     to exaggerate about additional work I may need.

  4) From my experience, they did not charge for minor stuff like nuts,
     washers etc. (some porsche mechanics do).  

  5) I found their prices to be very reasonable.

car except, when I crawled under the engine there was oil seepage (not 
a leak - NO drips; just oil that shows up when you run your finger

Questions:  What is it?

	Is this "extraordinary" (car has 52k miles on it)?

	Is it a problem or does it portend problems?  

	If so, how serious/expensive?

	Is it a "deal breaker" (i.e. does it put the car in the category 
of "don't touch it unless you have a swiss bank account")? 

Thanks for the help.  By the way, thanks to those who gave me the "test

I am trying to gather information on more aggressive combinations: ex. 9x16 with 
245/45-16 will fit the Carreras with no fender rub and fill the wells well. The 
front is a different story and information on fitting anything bigger than a 
7x16 with 205/55-16 produces problems.
	I have tried an 8x16 with 225/50-16. It works when the car is at 
standard factory height (USA). When lowered to "Euro Spec" (front fender 
lip-ground: 21.5", rear fender lip-ground: 21") the tires rub the fender lip. 
Has anyone tried to fit a 205/55-16 on an 8x16 rim ? Can this tire be fitted adn 
does it cure the problem ? Mr. Winders suggested using an 8x16 rim with a 
225/45-16 tire. Any comments ? This combination should lower the car an 
additional 1/2" (225/50-16 has a wheel height of 24.86", rim-ground height of 
4.43" and a circumference of 78.1". 225/45-16 has a wheel height of 23.97", 
rim-ground height of 3.99" and a circumference of 75.3").

I hope that you "tire guys" out there give me some feedback so I can expand this 
FAQ. Stan ? Bruce ???

Subject: A 1st time buyers trip through la-la land

I subscribed to the list to get some sort of independent 1st time 
buyer information, and hope my experiences may be useful to others
in the same position. Apologies to those who don't give a damn.

These are pretty much in chronological order as I searched. I 
was pretty much interested in a water-cooled automatic. Eventually,
either I'll learn how to drive or I'll make big money and get a
used tiptronic. Current budget is around $10K, pref less.

I looked through local papers (several) and photo ad books to
get leads. These cars were spread out in a 40 mile area centered on
Los Angeles.
 

		'84 944 automatic  $6500 at porsche/ferrari dealer.

			Car had 60K miles on phone and 80K on odometer.
			It sure must have been popular for test drives for
			this mileage to be accrued in an hour or two!

			Leather upholstery beginning to come apart.
			Extreme vibration which went away with car in gear.
			Pop up lights behave randomly. Salesman cannot explain
			how lights are operated, starts playing with them like
			a puzzle. Quite amusing if you have the time for it...

		'87 924S automatic $6500. 65K miles or so. 2nd PORSCHE dealer

			Lookeda little cleaner than previous car.
			Service contract available.
		
			Salesman appears to be knowledgable. He could
			even demonstrate the headlights :-)

			Examined by Porsche restoration shop nearby.
			Evidence of at least 3 accidents. Damage to 
			front right valence apron and right rear moulding
			missing. Engine smokes under load. Leaking somewhere
			but who cares. 

			THIS CAR IS STILL FOR SALE ! - did YOU just buy it?

			And the dealer tried to explain how they wholesaled
out the bad ones, because PORSCHE had such high standards. 

		
		Began looking private party.	


		'84 928S. 4-spd Automatic. 60K miles ask $10.5K pp

			Tranny did not downshift with gas pedal
			on floor. Leaked Oil. Bald front tires.
			Seller likes to take curves at 4X rated speed,
			and go through Canada at 130mph. 
	

		2 impeccably maintained '84s go for $12K before I can
		even get a chance to look at them.
				

		'82 928S. 3-spd automatic. 110K miles ask $6900 pp

			Had ALL records. Given as gift to college aged
			guy by aunt -- it was her car for several years
			and his for one. Her service records showed no fear
			of $2K and $3K repairs. Does a 928 muffler really
			cost $500 ? WOW

			A/C did not work, but seller only asking $6900.
			Car drove excellent...lots of power.... but
			mechanic sez interesting gummy stuff in radiator,
			transmission and engine seals leaking. Engine is ok
			for now but seal repair will cost $2K or more. 
			Electrical intermittent affecting warning lights
			and tachometer.

			[random off the wall mechanic -- may have been
			 full of BS abt cost--  but if it leaks I dont want it ]
			Suprisingly, the seller said he knew nothing about
			radiator fluid or other goodies.....


To heck with this.....till this guy on vacation calls on phone...

WINNER:	'87 924S 20K miles. pp seller asks $9000

	MINT. Interior perfect. Carpet extremely clean, no cracks on leather
anywhere. Was anniversary gift to wife. Retiring. Just sold 30ft motorhome,
keeping BMW + 4x4. 

	Suspicious that clean interior hides lemon underneath hood.... 
but it becomes apparent that these people are very proud of their car. 
Unsuccessful earlier attempt to sell at $11 000, but not willing to budge on
current  price. Would rather keep it.
Only warranty maintanence has been done. Oil changed at 2500 mi (6-8 months).
Insists vehicle only be looked at by Porsche. Nearby dealership finds:
window washer motor defective, front brake pads worn, belts should be changed.
Seller offers to replace brakes. Price is a little high but what the hell...
I said I'd buy it....

Now to get financed....yuck...I hate telling banks what my grad school 
salary is...well theres allways that $10000 visa card I got in the mail.
14% aint all that bad.

I must say the premium 924 looks a lot better than the junk 928s. I just
wish I had a sliding sunroof, and cruise, and a V8 engine etc...TANSTAAFL

Subject: Re:  928 warnings?

My '86 went for $16.5K in 1991. You now have an '87 at -- do I
remember right? -- about $11k? That seems low. I'd check maintenance
histories, if available. But absent any glaring deficiencies, you 
may just have a car which needs to move... maybe the color is
oogly.

I regret I don't have an options listing for the 928. I would 
assume it will have full leather seating, air, cassette stereo,
cruise, power mirrors and windows. Most of those came standard.

IMHO, the '86-'88 928 family is a great buy because prices are low
and the car is an excellent vehicle. Porsche made a LOT of them and
"flooded the market" (relatively), causing the prices to plummet.
You can pick up a good 928 for relatively little cash.

Subject: Re: 911 WHEEL FAQ

I find the Perf. Handbook data to be on the conservative side.  16" 
wheels do work well on a stock '77 911, but with narrow rubber.  Also, 
Bruce notes in his Tech. Notes column if not the book, that you really 
have to try sizes by trial and error, as what may fit on one car may not 
fit on another of the same model.

I'm curious as to what to look for when switching from factory shocks 
(green bilsteins in front, and yellow shocks in rear) to KYB shocks.  Do 
I have to order anything special from the KYB model #'s, or can I just 
specify '77 911S?

What effect on ride height and/or tire rubbing may going to new KYB's 
have.  Is it a correct assumption that ride height will go up, as will 
tire clearance, since the shocks are new compared to what I believe are 
the original shocks in the car with 135K on it?

This is a very, very, very low key event with lots of 356s to ogle (not just

In my limited experience, shock wear itself has a limited effect on ride height. 
(I believe that even the factory manual states that after "settling" of the 
suspension, differences are about 10mm). Although when I changed my Bilsteins 
for Koni's (red) there was definitely a visible increase in ride height, to the 
point where Ihad the car lowered. For what it's worth....

Yours is by far the most encouraging response I have received.  Others I 
have spoken to have raised nightmare scenarios of $1000's of dollars of 
engine work (replace gasket, grind down cylinders, engine block crack 
etc.etc.)  Questions:  On the 60K mile service (major service):
 
1.  Typical cost for service?

2.  Don't they replce gasket as part of that service?

Thanks again for the info.  Car goes in either tomorrow or Tuesday for 
pre-purchase!

Subject: 928 problems.


I got to drive the 84 928 that I was looking at and here are some comments.
 

Car started with no problems or hesitation.  The motor sounds fine, no loud
exhaust leaks or strange noises.  Brakes work fine.  No rattles or seriously
worn interior pieces. 

What I DID find out wrong was this:
 
Right windows will not roll down. Owner thinks it is a bad motor.
Switch for electric mirrors is broken.
The car is not fast.
 

To me, it seemed that the gas pedal only traveled about 2 inches before stopping.
Is this a common distance?   The car did not accellerate quickly.  I was VERY 
unimpressed.  If the gas pedal is not being blocked or is messed up, then
I would say the car has some serious problem with the engine or transmission.
BTW: The transmission seemed ok. It went through all gears and reverse fine.

I am not used to Automatic sports cars but I would think that for an 
8 cylinder Porsche engine, the car would be very fast.
 
Anyone have any comments.  I like the car except for the auto and the 
accelleration.   It seems to come down to this 928 or a MB 190.  
Personally, I like Porsches MUCH better.
 

Thanks
 
Kevin

Subject: Re: '76 911

I purchased a 76 911S a few years back.  Some key tips I got from that 
experience:

	1.  Watch out for re-painted cars.  Often repainted because of 
accident.  Look for "overspray" around doors and check inside front boot 
under the "carpet."

	2.  Related topic:  Make sure its STRAIGHT!  (Hint: look at tire wear 
& check all the seams.  Make sure doors close flush and easy.)

	3.  Mine had typical oil leak problems at push tubes (oil return tubes)

	4.  How many miles on engine?  And is it an S, T or E?

	5.  Mine was not great in snow (didn't have much in D.C.) (Don't really 
know if any one is) although I made it through an entire winter.

	6.  Check out a/c (if you want it) and cruise (same).  Both were 
shot on mine.

	7.  ABSOLUTE MUST:  Take it to a mech with NO interest in the 
sale for a pre-purchase inspection.

Others will be more knowledgable than I on this list, so listen to them.  
These are just my personal experiences with one car and one mech.  Hope 
you do better.  Key is to be PATIENT.  The *right* car at the *right*  
price will eventually come along.

Good luck and enjoy!  (Despite its problems we still loved our 76!)

I too have an '86 951, which has the same brakes as the S2.  I'm 
running Performance Friction pads and they rattle without pressure, and 
CLUNK loudly on initial application.  The imperfect fit (that causes 
the rattle) lets them wiggle away from the rotors, pushing the pistons 
back.  The clunk is just the pads coming back to the rotors.  You may 
also notice erratic brake pedal actuation height, since the pistons 
move away from the rotors.  Pretty disconcerting on the track!  Also 
normal with some aftermarket pads.

Kevin,

I once purchased a 1981 928 and when I drove it I noticed a very similar
problem. When you pressed the accelerator pedal all the way the car didn't
semm to accelerate properly. The pedal would go all the way to the floor 
bot would have more resistance after about half way. The car was also pretty
slow. Looking up under the hood I noticed that the linkage was spring loaded
and operated in two stages (kind of like the secondaries in a carb) and 
the throttle was not opening all the way. I'm not sure if this was caused 
from the car sitting up not being used, but a little WD-40 and working the 
throttle back and forth (at the throttle body) and it was like a brand 
new car. Hope this helps, the car should perform quite well if it is OK.

A couple of gems in our local paper Sunday, June 5 :

1986 944 Turbo
 -  new paint
 -  all major service
 -  excellent condition
 -  $7750
 -  (205)772-0250

1976 930 Turbo
 -  never wrecked
 -  needs paint
 -  $14500
 -  (205)582-3028

I couldn't resist and called about the 930.  It has approx. 100k miles on it.
The owner said the engine was rebuilt about two years ago, although he has
no documentation.  The car is black with 16 inch BBS wheels; was painted
about 7-8 years ago and he said it looks good from a distance, but will need
paint again soon.  No signs of any body damage, rust, etc.  Interior is near
perfect condition with late model 911 leather seats.  Has front-bumper mounted
auxiliary oil cooler - he said the car has yet to run >80 degrees C.  I asked 
about Carrera tensioners - he didn't know.  This guy bought the car about two
weeks ago for the purpose of resale (he does this as a hobby).  He took the
thing to his local mechanic who diagnosed a bad fuel pump(the car would 
cut out at full throttle).  New fuel pump going in Tuesday.  

This actually sounds like a decent car for the money.

Subject: Re:  928 problems.

I have an 84 928S, with manual transmission. The US version of the car
has 234 SAE horsepower (other country versions have more - fewer
emissions controls, more compression). The factory says the automatic
version should go 0-60 mph in 7.2 seconds, standing quarter mile
in 15.5 seconds, top speed 143 mph. The manual transmission version
is a little faster (6.8, 15.2, 146). This is a heavy car - 3351 lbs -
but it certainly feels fast to me. 

What you describe seems consistent with only being able to get half
throttle. I guess you really have to find out why that is happening
before you go further - could be something trivial, could be that it
is masking something serious.

I don't think that an automatic transmission in a 928 is such a bad
thing. Especially if you drive in traffic a lot. The car is a very
different thing from the 911, more of a GT than a sports car. Mine
is an every day driver, and although I scorned automatics when I
bought it, I think now that it would be acceptable, maybe even
preferable. By the way, I still love it.

Peter, below is the note I made on a Phone call to George Vellios 
(310) 542-0806, a noted builder of Porsche 914s, in response to an article
on him in European Car (about him making large cylinders for Porsche boxer
engines.  see the Motec coments:


9/30/93: 1105 AM - I called George and spoke at length.  He is still in the
Jug business.  He is testing the Duralcan 102 mm jugs on an engine now, and
has run it for 7 days.  A set will run $3,100, Labor $2,000 and the Motec
Injection about $5,000 (the Motec alone is $3,100).   He says that that the
stock injectors are proprietary 75 ohm, and the Motec are 5 ohm.  The Motec
with his handsome Injection manifold is not street legal, so we would have
to keep the stock Porsche Manifold and use GM injectors which flow much
more fuel.  George says that the Motec uses Vacuum, rather than directly
measuring air-flow, Lambda (to measure free oxygen in the exhaust, and
Throtle position to calculate the Stociometric Fuel/air ratio, where it
runs.  He says that the Motec is much more sophisticated than the Haltech,
using twice as many rpm points.  Like the Haltech, you can download as many
maps as you like, using a cheap DOS laptop.

  Probably no original switch works, its less likely the motor than the
   switch. Porsche redsigned this switch somewheres along the line, the
   old ones don't last that long. Switches aren't that expensive and
   replacement is not difficult.

>The car is not fast.
  Any 928 should be fast if it is in good shape, even high mileage cars.
  My '79 has over 110k miles and will still pull strong at 120 mph (thats
  when I quit, not the car).
    Like Keith Roberts' experience the spring-returns on the accelerator
  linkage of my car got sticky. On mine, the first couple inches of travel
  were -extremely- light, like a hair trigger. Then the pedal went firm for   
  the remainder of travel. Like Keith's car, spraying wd-40 on the springs  
  fixed it. Could be that you were polite enough on the test drive not to  
  slam it to the floor, when you may have found more pedal there.
    I've also had a sticky brake pedal. Never figured that out, it eventually
  seemed to go away, but it did make for awkward braking.
    928s are very good cars, they lack the light-fun of a 911, but (if you can
  get past all the little stuff that will fail) they are basically very
  hardy, comfortable, fabulous cars to drive. Its definitely a buyers market,
  get the best car you can afford.

A good friend of mine is getting ready to buy a 968.  I believe the car she

making an offer on a car at Don McGill's lot in Houston.  

She is in her late 30's and not a real driving nut, so I don't think she 
will be stressing the car much.  But maybe she will let me autocross or time

Subject: 944-hesitation

Diagnostic Help Requested:

My '84 944 has developed a hesitation, most often when the engine is under
slight stress (gentle acceleration) but now even noticed under hard
acceleration.  It occurs between 2400 and 3500 rpms and feels like a bit of
bad gas or a transient miss.

This was first noticed at a drivers school when I'd put the car in 4th and
got off the throttle enough to let someone pass; when I got back into the
throttle (still in 4th) at about 3000 it bucked slightly then ran fine. The
car was running at the fully warmed up but normal temp.

I had just put a single bottle of Techron through.  This was the first such
bottle in 3 years (I'm just learning these things).  I only use Shell middle
or premium gas.

Attempts so far:  Because the car was due to have these I changed: air
filter, fuel filter and spark plugs (Bosch Platinum).  But alas it is still
hesitating and seems to be getting worse.

Other ideas:  Injectors (run another bottle of Techron through?)
              Air Mass Sensor (now beyond my mechanical/electronic
                     experience!?)
              Other??  Help??

On another subject: Our Motorstadt ("the mystery region") PCA club just had
an informal rally.  We had 11 cars participate (2-914s, 3-944s, and 6-911s).

Subject: 944 brake clunking

Saturday Mike Todd asked about rear brake clunking in a 944.  It sounded
like he'd not gotten under to look so this experience might be relevant!

I too had a clunking in the right rear brake.  Everything seemed fine with
the operation but it clunked when I applied the brakes.  Even being a
mechanical dufus I crawled under to discover the retaining pins of the right
rear break assembly had backed out, almost touching the wheel!!  The double
retaining clip (like two cauter pins (sp?) combined) had come loose
permitting the pins to work out.  I tapped the pins back and reinstalled
the clip (properly?) and the clunking went away.  I now have what I consider
a much safer set up with individual clips (i.e. one for each pin).  Is this
common?

Bill,

     Your cruise control module is under the passenger seat.
don't know about diagnosing it, you've tried the obvious.  You
might check the vacuum line to the throttle actuator, and the
cable to the throttle.  Mine works, but surges.  There is
probably an adjustment on the controller for this, but I haven't
pursued it.

     Re the long trip.  Carry the normal stuff like a fan belt
(be sure you have the tools to replace the belt), and check that
the tire inflator works, and that you have the key to your wheel
locks with you ;)   Then, prepare to enjoy.

Subject: 993


Last week I had the priviledge to try the new 993 for 
a quick (read short) ride. 

The car was "irisblaumetallic" with grey leather interior - looked great.
I could'nt really test the car (if I had casued any damage it would
have cost me more than 3000$) but I fully agree with the judgement
it has been given in the press.

I, however, don't think that the new 911 is 75000$ better than my
'82 911SC... not with my budget.

Anyway, a caution for those of you who will try the new 911 and
wants to have the lights on. In Sweden the law says that tha lights
shall be on, even in daylight. So, I have a habit of always pull out
the light knob after having started the car and did so also in the 993.
It turned out to be not so good on a TURNING switch which became switches -
one part in my hand and the rest in the panel...(yes, I could put the pieces
together)

Subject: 356 air filters

     Poking around the new (3 weeks) 356SC, I decided to clean
those unique looking Knecht screen air filters.  Seeing the
coarse screen outer surface, I assumed that the inside was packed
with some kind of steel-woolish stuff to act as a filter when oil
coated.  *WRONG*    That coarse screen is *IT*    Mine were
neither dirty or oily, indicating to me that the air isn't being
cleaned of anything much finer than leaves and rocks.  Well, I
dribbled some ATF through them, let them drain, and re-installed.
So here's the question.  Do these things really work, or is this
the reason these cars seem to need rings so frequently (~70k)?
Is there a better filter option (like K&N) available for the
Solex 40's?

     BTW, I put Konis on the car, and the ride is *GREATLY*
improved.  I guess the valving in the old shocks was inoperative.

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What can you tell me about the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          President, NetSmiths, Ltd.

          '64 356 SC (OK, so he fell in love again).

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How is the list maintained?
     
     The list is maintained fairly regularly.  Stan tries to handle
changes at least once every other day.  There will probably be times
when he's on the road and less able to deal with problems, so be
patient.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  You can also 
reach Stan by phone at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070 when he's not
traveling.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What about Unix-based mail problems with the list?

     If you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay attention to 
your replies.  The default will send the reply to the "porschephiles-
request" address, as it is the UUCP "From" address (first actual line 
of the mail header).  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT STAN ROUTINELY TRASHES SUCH 
MIS-ROUTED MAIL!  If your mailer starts screwing up, you will be dropped
from the list.  Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any 
more, send Stan mail and he will do his best to figure out what's
happening.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the copyrights or ownership of material sent to the list?

     The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence
by and between members of a closed community.  As such, the copyright
for EVERYTHING that ANYONE posts lies with them.  PERIOD.  This is 
*NOT* a bulletin board system, where consent for further redistribution
is implied by nature of the the system; it's PRIVATE.  If you wish to
use something written by someone on the list, you must first seek their
permission unless they specifically grant the right in that specific
posting to reprint it at will.  And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD idea
to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing
up down the line.  Remember, when you read something on this list: what
you are reading belongs to whoever wrote it.  They may have plans to
publish it further themselves.  They may want to keep it "private"
(i.e. just for list member use).  They may not care what gets done with
it.  It's still theirs, and before re-use, permission must be
obtained.  Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a
big deal about it.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available via FTP at tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/
Archives in five subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94) each of which has 
the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  Period!!!  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM
CST, or Stan may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to
mail you archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to
use BINARY mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX
"uncompress" program, or equivalent, to restore to textual format.

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
            1970.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914, 1976.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
            of the four-cylinder engine.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 as the 924S with the 944 drivetrain.
            Has the best aerodynamic shape of any Porsche.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the
            front, water-cooled, has grown from an original 4.5 litres 
            to 5.4 today.
     930  - Turbocharged 911, homologation and street version of the
            racing 934.
     931  - Turbocharged 924, sold in 1980-1982.
     944  - Front-engined, water-cooled inline four cylinder car, with
            nearly perfect 50/50 weight bias.  Sixteen-valve and
            turbocharged versions were produced.  Produced from 1982
            through 1991. 2.5 litre displacement, except for a 2.7 litre
            eight-valve 944 model in 1989 and the 3.0 litre 944S2.
     951  - The turbo version of the 944.  Built from 1985 to 1991.
     959  - Supercar 911 derivative.  2.85 litre, four valve, twin cam,
            dual turbochargers, all-wheel drive.
     964  - Another name for the 911 Carrera 4 and Carrera 2 as introduced
            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, due in showrooms in 4/94.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What are the meanings of terms and acronyms I've seen in the list?

     FAQ  - Frequently asked questions (but you knew that)
     FWIW - For what it's worth
     IMHO - In my humble opinion
     IMO  - In my opinion
     PCA  - Porsche Club of America, the major US/Canada Porsche
            enthusiasts organization
     POC  - Porsche Owner's Club, the *other* US Porsche owner's group;
            in the past they have been more competition-oriented than 
            PCA, which has many interest groups participating
     PCGB - Porsche Club of Great Britain
     PCNA - Porsche Cars of North America (Reno, NV), the US importer
     PANO - Not an acronym; this stands for Porsche Panorama, the PCA 
            national monthly magazine
     PAG  - Porsche AG, the mother company back in Stuttgart; "AG"
            stands for "Aktiengesselschaft," which means that the 
            company has publicly traded stock
     YMMV - Your mileage may vary
     :-)  - Smiley face (turn your head 90 degrees to the left to "read"
            it); various iterations exist using different ASCII

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:
Information about water-cooled cars is lacking; those with favorites
should submit them to one of the names at the end of this FAQ.)

There are also Haynes manuals available for most models.  While the
Haynes manuals tend to be very weak on specifics having to do with
different model years and variations, they are good at teaching how-to
procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other well-known Porsche people) here?
 
     Bruce was invited to join and did so back in '91. The load then
was too much for him.  All of what, 2k a day or so.  Now, at 15x to 20x
that load, he probably doesn't want back on.  He's not stupid -- he 
knows where we are.

     No specifics are available regarding other renowned Porsche people.

Hi Mike,

   You might not want to wait 'till the weekend on this one. I had a similar
experience recently, with a front brake though. The top caliper bolt was
holding the caliper in place loosely, the lower bolt was >gone<. It would
appear that the disk had warped and shaken, not stirred, hard enough to 
loosend the bolts... new disk & bolts, torqued to spec by me this time,
and all's well - but it could have been much worse. Gotta look into it
right away whenever your car goes to the trouble of actually notifying you
that "there may be a problem down here..."

Subject: Do I need new wheels?

Well, I went to get my wheels (15x6 Stock Fuchs Alloys) balanced over the 
weekend.  I was getting vibration through the steering wheel at speeds 
above 60mph.  While balancing my wheels the store manager told me, "I know
what your problem is.  Your wheels are not true.  Looks like this care
may have hit a few too many potholes."  I watched them spin balance the 
wheels and I could see the wheels moving up and down slightly.

The guy said I'm going to have to buy new wheels to get rid of the vibration.
Is he right?  Can I get the wheels repaired?  Is this common for '73 Fuchs
with 90K miles on them?  I thought forged alloys were strong wheels.

My wife has the "25th anniversary edition" on her 89 coupe, which sounds
like it might be the same "celebration".  This was first available in the US
in 88.  It came with a very nice floor-to-dash console with an "outside
temperature" gauge and cassette holders (along with the usual AC controls
and power door lock switch), special gray leather with black piping on
seats, matching gray leather steering wheel, thick color-matching carpet
in the trunk, and painted wheels and hubs to match the special black
metallic finish.  I believe you could only get this car in either this black
or silver.  I think of this mostly as fluff that adds almost nothing to the
car's value, in spite of the few thousand dollars the original buyer paid
for it.  But I can think of no reason why prices should be cheaper for these
years, with or without the package.

Subject:      944S: Engine whine

In preparation for changing my timing/balance belts, this weekend
I went ahead and adjusted the timing belt to become familiar with
the layout of things.  I have the self-tensioner, so that was easy
enough. However, I found that the balance belt was VERY loose.
I realized that was the cause of the noise the engine would make
while warming up. I could also see where the belt had worn against
the self-tensioner on the rear side of the belt due to the excess
slack in the belt.

Also, the balance belt idler was nowhere near being in contact with the belt.
So, I adjusted the balance belt tension to somewhere close to what the
cam belt tension was..enough the take the slack out.  And I also adjusted
the idler as per instructions in the 944S service manual.  Now, when
the engine runs, it has a very distinct whine.   I took everything apart
again and loosened the balance belt just a tad.  The whine isn't as loud
as it first was.  I'm positive the cam belt is fine and that this whine
is related to the balance belt.  So what's the cause of the whine?
I suspect the idler (since it had not been turning for so long) or
possibly another roller bearing.  The engine runs fine otherwise.
Any ideas/suggestions?   I'll be ordering replacement rollers and belts
today.

  Why do you want to lower it?
  - Looks better?
  - Handling?

  Whenever you dink with the stock setup, there will be compromises
one way or another.  Lowering the car can provide some benefits in
the areas of looks and handling (more negative camber) at the expense
of potential tire wear problems and the need for creative negotiation 

of steep curbs. 


If I recall correctly, the Euro specs have the car riding 1.25" lower
in front and 1" in the rear in addition to a more aggressive alignment 

setup 0deg toe, -1.25 deg camber front, -1.5 deg camber rear.  There 

were a couple of articles in Excellence last year where they did some
suspension mods to a C4 along these lines that might help you to see
the various options available. 


I put a set of H&R sport springs on my RS America recently, and am
very happy with the results so far.  The ride is not significantly
harsher than the factory springs, but the car turns-in and corners
much better.

To lower the 964, you basically have two choices:

1. Cut the stock springs down 

2. Purchase a set of shorter after-market springs

FWIW:  I would be a little wary of doing just the fronts unless you
really know the spring rates and what you're trying to accomplish. 

Most of the after-market pieces are stiffer than the factory units 

(especially if you don't have the M030 option).  Placing stiffer 

lower springs on the front and stock springs on the back would 

probably make the car push (understeer) big time.  Also, most of
the after-market springs only come in sets of 4.

Subject: 1971 911E transmission

I have been informed my 1971 911E has a mongrel transmission.

My Porsche shop claims the ratio gap between 2nd and third is way to
wide. They speculate a previous owner lost second gear and for some
reason replaced the transmission shaft (which contains second gear) and
first gear with a unit from a early, 2.0 l 911). They speculate this
was done out of ignorance/incompetence or perhaps to save $$ because
for some reason the wrong main shaft was cheaper at the time of this
repair.

Anyway, I would be grateful if any of my fellow 911 owners could
provide me with the correct part numbers for the following.


1971 911E main transmission shaft with second gear

1971 911E first gear assembly

I have been told any transmission from a 2.2 liter car would have the
correct gears.

Beside having the wrong first and second gear, fifth gear whines on
this transmission. The transmission functions well otherwise.

PCNA tells me for a period in 1971, Porsche did not record transmission
numbers and there is no matching number available for my serial number
chassis. 

Perhaps I would be better off just acquiring a rebuilt 2.2 l
transmission.

Does anyone have any experience with a reputable source for a
reconditioned 2.2 l transmission? Does anyone know the serial number
range for 2.2 l car transmissions?

Tell her to never buy any used Porsche unless it has been thouroughly

Tell her she shouldn't spend over $30k for a used 968.  Tell her someone
on the net has a $6k discount coupon from PCNA good for *any* new 94.
She should price a new 968 and subtract $6k.  And then figure what a used
one should cost (according to the fast 944 depreciation schedule).

Tell her she should estimate maintenance (tune-ups and such) by guessing
what they should cost and then tripling it.

Tell her never to take the car for service to anyone other than a very
well respected Porsche shop or the dealer.  Tell her she'll be happier
with the former but she'll have to learn that the hard way.

Tell her she is getting a terrific car that deserves to be driven in ways it

Tell her that women look much more beautiful behind the wheel of a

Good advice. Never take chances with your braking system.

However, it may not be as serious as all that.  Ever since I switched to
Cool Carbons, I've had a bit of a clunk in my '87 951 when I first apply
the brakes after backing up out of a parking space or the driveway. I
assume it's just that the Cool Carbons don't quite fit the calipers,
since I have no detectable broken bolts, etc. as John described. For the
record, I was using MetalMasters before I switched and never had a
clunk with them.

Theo Writes:

My car is an 87 Carrera with 33,000 miles, well kept,............

In mid March I noticed that I kept needing to add water to the 911 battery, 
and it kept leaking from the top.....

When I arrived home and opened the luggage compartment to check I found hot
fluid boiling over from the battery and soaking the rags I had on top to
absorb the leaking fluid. Quick, bicarbonate of soda...
This is no way to treat a Carrera!!!

I took the car to the dealer, who checked and found the battery was ok, but
the alternator sends over 18 volts to the battery while the car is
stationary and the engine revved to  2,500-3,000 rpm (approx). "You have
trouble keeping water in the battery, haven't you?" the mechanics
correctly diagnosed while kidding me. I thought "voltage regulator", but
they insist that it can not be just the regulator diodes, the alternator
must be at or near need of replacement too, and if you get that far into
the repair you may as well do both. They are happy to give me replacement
parts (with the French ID numbers you mentioned in your article) 
plus do the work for around $600, +/-$? 
	
Theo Et Al;
	The regulator is in an assembly with the brush holder, and is
	extremely easy to replace, once you've removed the alternator
	from the car. No Soldering, etc, Also you get the chance to
	inspect the balance of the assy. for defects, before committing
	to the $600- job, or complete rebuild.
	The Regulator Assy is available from your favorite Dealer
	for approx $35-, and assembles, by removing two bolts, unpluging
	two push on connectors, and snapping the assy off the back side
	of the alternator. 

(from Posting 2 Mar 94)
	>1) Remove Brush Holder/Regulator Assembly. Two bolts on back of
	   Alternator retaining a Black Plastic Housing with an Aluminum 
	   Heat Sink, immediately above the rear bearing housing. Remove two
	   push on connectors from the Diode Arrays on either side.

		Note: The Holder is snapped over catches on the bearing 
		housing. Pry the ends, adjacent to the bearing housing, 
		with screw driver and push it out in a radial

Subject: 914 engine/tranny removal and other rustoration questions:

Hello to all P-files, and esp. the 914 guru types,

	I am preparing for the potentially painful prospect of removing 
the the engine/tranny combo from my little 914 so that it might not be a 
flexy-flyer(going to the body shop for RUSToration). I have never dropped 
the engine from one of these automobiles, and I was wondering if the 
great net-oracle has any special advice to share about their experiences 
doing this. I have read both the Haynes and Lash manuals several times 
and I can't believe that it is as easy as they describe. 

Also, since I am preparing to deliver this little guy, how should I do 
this? What I mean, is should I secure a trailer?--I am planning to deliver 
it with the front suspension intact and with the rear axle shafts and 
inner CV's wired up. Can the car be rolled(towed) in this fashion or 
should I just get some of my strong friends to roll it onto a trailer? I 
am planning to replace the rear springs/bushings so would it be a good 
idea to just completely disassemble the rear suspension (front too?) before 
delivery and just drop off the almost bare tub? The shop is about 5 miles 
from my home if this makes any difference. 

Other random questions include: I am planning to convert my 914 to a six. 
But alas, I haven't the engine to do this. Is it possible to have the 
shop install the mounting hardware so that the 6 will be a bolt-in but 
still be able to mount the 4 while I save for 6? I would *really* like to 
send this to the shop once.(BTW, I will be happy to accept any unwanted

I think this was an edition commemorative of somethine or other.  The
911's had a really pretty purple/blue metallic paint job with matching
leather interior, and Ferry's signature embroidered into the headrests.
I forget the 944 colour in the edition, perhaps a metallic black.

Anyway, pretty cars if a bit unusual looking.  Saw a pristine example of
one of the 911's at Lime Rock Park today -- driver's ed day.  Also saw
and drove with two of the North American 348 Challenge Ferrari's.

Two jobs come to mind: (1) replacing the oil pressure sender. It's almost
impossible to get to with the engine in the car. (2) replacing *ALL*
the CIS boots -- the six guys going to the air box, the one big one from the
fuel distributor to the air box, all the injector seals. I've never been
able to replace the six airbox-to-runner boots with the engine in the car
even though the book says you can...

Not really. To take out the engine, you pretty much gotta take out the
tranny at the same time. The converse is *NOT* true. I also tend to 
buy rebuilt trannys with decent warranties too -- it's about $1500
no matter what you do...

Good question!  I would like the same answer for my 90 C4.  I just checked 
with a mechanic and he obviously said that I shouldn't do this because it 
will change the original suspension that Porsche considers optimum.  He also 
said that a lot or the whole suspension for Europe is completely different 
than the U.S. and I would have to change too much components to make it the 
same as Europe.  I think he really didn't want me to change anything from 
stock, but I still don't like the front end sticking up higher than the rear. 
 I figured the Euro spec is the most conservative way to lower my car.  Can 
anybody also tell me where they measure for the specification beside the 
questions that Bill asked.

This has been a burning question for me for a long time about how to lower 
it.  I think I'll start with the Euro way first.

Subject: Re: 356 air filters

Dear Bob:

         You're right! THe Wire Mesh Solex A/F are just that- wire mesh. No
foam. No steel wool. No nothin'.  They screen out the boulders and things,
but the fines get through UNLESS they are oiled.  (As one can observe by
counting the craters in the head/piston where the micrometeorites have
impacted, in engines where UN-oiled wire mesh filters are used. )
    Theoretically, the wire making up the wire mesh is twisted, and the air
turns, but the heavier particles don't and are entrained, fly-paper-like on
the oiled metal mesh. Theoretically.
    In Reality, oiled Wire Mesh air filters VERY quickly get dirty and look
ugly. So they're cleaned. But hardly ever re-oiled. Ergo, the impact craters.
     Wire mesh filters do have lower resistance to air flow; Speed costs
money, how fast do you want to go.  K&N  (real) air filters are better (as
are the "Real" 912 trumpet-type Air Filters),  but aren't Original, so the
Purists will cry "foul" or "1 point off" or some such.
    I think ATF is OK, but I think 2-stroke motorcycle oil (meant to burn
ash-free) is a better choice, as that which gets sucked inside won't foul the
plug as much.

The turbo water pump runs under two conditions: high water temp at any 
time (even with ignition off), and right after shutdown (for 25 secs) 
under any condition.

Two areas to consider:
1) The cool-down thermostat switch, which is a little piece screwed 
into a water pipe atop the engine, behind the air cleaner and nestled 
next to the throttle housing.  There's a single dark wire going to the 
top of it (just pushes onto the switch).  Next time the problem occurs, 
pull this wire and wait 30 seconds for the pump to stop.  If it stops, 
the thermostat is bad.  If it doesn't then goto #2.  Also consider 
wiring damage - grounding this wire starts the pump.

2) The turbo cool-down pump relay & actuating logic may be bad.  Swap 
the relay to see if this fixes it.

Subject: Re:  914 engine/tranny removal and other rustoration questions:


Greetings Dave,

| 
| Hello to all P-files, and esp. the 914 guru types,
| 
| 	I am preparing for the potentially painful prospect of removing 
| the the engine/tranny combo from my little 914 so that it might not be a 
| flexy-flyer(going to the body shop for RUSToration). I have never dropped 
| the engine from one of these automobiles, and I was wondering if the 
| great net-oracle has any special advice to share about their experiences 
| doing this. I have read both the Haynes and Lash manuals several times 
| and I can't believe that it is as easy as they describe. 

It really _is_ that easy.  Remove the half-shafts, the throttle cable and
the clutch cable, unplug the FI wiring, disconnect the fuel lines and
heater stuff, put a jack under the engine/transaxle, remove 4 bolts,
and drop it out!  Depending on how high you jack your car, you may also
want to remove the rear valance and the air filter to allow enough clearance
to roll the assembly out from underneath the car.

| 
| Also, since I am preparing to deliver this little guy, how should I do 
| this? What I mean, is should I secure a trailer?--I am planning to deliver 
| it with the front suspension intact and with the rear axle shafts and 
| inner CV's wired up. Can the car be rolled(towed) in this fashion or 
| should I just get some of my strong friends to roll it onto a trailer? I 
| am planning to replace the rear springs/bushings so would it be a good 
| idea to just completely disassemble the rear suspension (front too?) before 
| delivery and just drop off the almost bare tub? The shop is about 5 miles 
| from my home if this makes any difference. 

Remove the half-shafts completely.  This will make the car easier to roll.
Speaking of which, I would keep the car as a roller.  The shop will want
to move the car around and you'll want to put it on a trailer anyway,
so just leave that stuff together.  When I had the serious rustwork done
on my car, it was just a tub with the suspension somewhat loosely connected.
When they replaced the rusted sections, they made a comment that chassis
alignment would have been easier if the engine/transaxle were in the car,
since this makes the car settle, and the doors align differently when
the weight is in.  The best thing is to talk to your shop and ask them
what they prefer.  IMHO, it's best to put the car completely on a trailer.
It will be more stable this way.  And if you remove the engine/transaxle, 
two people can easily put it on the trailer.  I couldn't believe how light
the car was (is)!


| 
| Other random questions include: I am planning to convert my 914 to a six. 
| But alas, I haven't the engine to do this. Is it possible to have the 
| shop install the mounting hardware so that the 6 will be a bolt-in but 
| still be able to mount the 4 while I save for 6? I would *really* like to 
| send this to the shop once.(BTW, I will be happy to accept any unwanted 
| Porsche boxers for this project--I'll even pay shipping 8-} ) 

I can't offer any help here.  The project was costly enough without the
six conversion.  (I did _everything_ from the ground-up.)

| How much of the interior needs to be removed so that nothing is burned by

| getting airy to about half-way toward the front. 

You might want to remove the whole interior.  There isn't much there, and
you might find some other things to repair/replace.  If you have the
stock '70 seat configuration, you may want them to weld in adjustable
seat brackets for the passenger side and do the conversion.  I have all 
the stuff you'll need if you're interested.

There's lots of places that make/sell these.  Pick up some Porsche-type mags 
and peruse the ads.  Excellence is a good source.

With regards to this clunking . . do you folks also feel a drop in the brake
pedal in concert with the "clunk"?  Steve's comment concerning the occurance
"after backing up out of a parking space or the driveway" is synonomous with
a "clunk" and sudden loss in pedal pressure I experience in my stock 944s2
every morning when my commute gets underway.  This "problem" has persisted
since I purchased the car back in '89, but has always been referred to as normal
by Porsche service managers (egads) and PCNA reps and engineers alike. This may

Greetings,

My '88 944 has developed a squeak in the hatch area which I suspect is
the hatch glass starting to come unglued. It only sqeaks when I go over
sharp bumps though not necessarily large ones.  When the car is standing
still, I cannot rock it hard enough to get it to sqeak so I cannot
positively identify the source. I've checked the hatch area thoroughly
and cannot find anything loose or rubbing that would cause the sqeak. 
Anyone had a similar experience? If it is the glass, is there a fix
other than visiting the local glass man to have it remounted?

Subject: Where to buy various screws?

Dear Steve,

As to thePorsche nuts and bolts, you have three options:

1. buy a kit of metric nuts, washers and bolts from the various Porsche
suppliers like Stoddard,

2. sand-blast the old ones and have them cadmium-lated,

3. buy what you need at the hardware store,


Option three is the least diserable, unless you can get cadmium plated
hardware. If you use regular steel it will rust in a matter of 2 years
attacking paint in the prodess. You could use stainless steel hardware, but
beware: stainless steel hardware does not have the strength nor the rating
of steel.  I use stainless steel in my 911 but only at places where load is
not a serious requirement imparing safety.

Option 2 I have exercised. When done correctly you will not be able to tell
the difference from new hardware.  Ste-up charge for doing a cadmium
plating is $65.  Be sure to specify yellow cadmium.  Do not allow excessive
plating as bolts and nuts will turn with difficulty.

Option 1 is in my opinion the most expensive and least satisfactory.  It
seems the kits never contain the nut, bolt, or waasher you want.

There are US manufacturers of cadmium-plated metric stuff.  My Porsche
repair man: Jose Herceg,the owner of Autobahn Services (independent Porsche
shop), at 3158a Spring Street, Fairfax, VA 22031, Phone (703) 691-1771, FAX

Just read in June '94 Porscheforus (NNJR monthly magazine) reprinted from Mar 
'94 issue of North Country newsletter:

Author of article was cruising in the New Hampshire countryside when he 
spotted several 993s parked in the middle of nowhere.  Of course, he stopped 
to check out the cars and investigate further.  Upon closer inspection the 
cars revealed "Manuf" plates from Nevada.  Confirming his suspicions, several 
well-dressed exec-types appeared from over a nearby hill, one whom turns out 
to be Fred Schwab.  Following at a slower pace is a silver-haired gentleman 
who is no other than Herr Doktor Ferry Porsche in the flesh!  Author 
introduced himself as a member of PCA and was invited to lunch where he was 
sworn to secrecy with regard to the location, in exchange for printing the 
story before the car rags got hold of it.  It appears that Porsche will build 
a plant somewhere-in-the-countryside in New Hampshire to assemble the Boxster. 

The engines will be built and assembled in Zuffenhausen and shipped over while 
the body panels will be supplied by BMW from their plant in South Carolina.  
Reasons stated for the decision were: relatively less-expensive cost of 
highly-skilled labor due to layoffs here and the White Mtns reminds Dr. 
Porsche of the Black Forest.  They stressed that relocated German engineers 
will supervise everything to maintain high standards of quality.

It seems that Porsche is following BMW's and Mercedes' lead in producing autos 
in the United States.  I hope that it translates to lower prices which mere 
mortals like yours truly can afford.

do it) for a mechanic.  The thermostat is a small grey 3! prong plug that
screws into the back side of the radiator.  They have to drop the fan assembly
to reach in and get it.

The auto hobbyist I envy a little less than the addressee (whose plans make

and to sit comfortably on a stool while wrestling with a tierod or whatever.
Just have to make sure everyone who uses that part of the garage can park

Subject: Re: Porsche Purchase

Jerry,

  Here are some of the tips which I got when I was looking for my car.
Generally speaking, the Carreras are pretty durable.  The engines when
they are maintained will go for 200k to 300k miles.  I saw a targa
during my search with 236k miles on it and the car was in pretty good
condition.  

  I would definitely take the car to a knowledgeable porsche mechanic
and have him do BOTH a leak down test and compression test.  You 
definitely don't want any bent valves or cylinders.  It's nice to get
same numbers for all cylinders, but that may be too much to ask for.

  Ask the original owner if there is documentation on the car.  My car
came with every single maintenance record since the day the car was
bought.  It's important to know the history of the car, even if it has
only 51k miles.  If you have some questions about some of the repairs
or work done on the car, bring the documentation to the mechanic an
and have him look through it.  Beware though, I have heard people who
doctor and make up fake records just to say they have all the maintenance
done to the car.  

  When you are test driving the car, drive the car HARD!  At 51k miles
the car is relatively low mileage but pretty soon, you may need new
syncros or dog teeth on your transmission.  Mine was replaced at 71k miles.
I have heard others who replaced theirs at 50k and others at 120k.  Push
the car to 5000 or 6000 rpm and see if the gears shift properly.  After
you have pushed the car hard for 20 minutes or so, check the temperature
guage to see if the engine temperature is still reasonable.  Also, right
after the drive, check to see the oil level and check underneath the
car to see if there are any oil leaks.  To check for oil levels, you
need to park the car level and leave the car in neutral.  With the
engine on, take out the dip meter and look at it.  With carreras, you
need to have the engine idling in order to properly measure the oil
levels.  

  My car had a few oil leaks from the oil return tubes which I eventually
had replaced.  Also, mine was very good in terms of engine temperature,
the temp needle never got above the first dash.  

  At 51k miles, all your belts should be coming up for replacement pretty
soon.  I would check those as well just to make sure.  If you are looking
for whether the car was repainted or hit before, take the car at night to
any shopping center with flourescent light or neon lights.  You can then
see if the paint shade is different.  Also, the sheet metal should all
come together at the lines.  If the hood lines don't quite match the
front flare lines at the headlights, chances are 1 or the other has
been replaced.  

  Another thing, Carreras need to have their valves adjusted every 15k miles.
See if that has been done regularly and if you do buy the car, definitely
have regular oil changes at 5k and valve adjustments every 15k.

  I think I am rambling on but mail me back if you need more information.
I not too much of a techie but these were some of the words of wisdom 
passed to me when I was on my search.  Good luck!

Rather than a lift, why not put in a work pit instead?  No mechanicals, 
no ceiling
height problems.  To me, the ideal pit would be perhaps three feet 
wider than the
car on each side, with (movable?) steel channels that one would drive the car

$3 each.
 
I just called the shop where I usually buy back issues; 1960-66 R&T goes for

My neighbor keeps trying to sell me on a pit with steel covers instead
of a lift.  A ramp or steps on one end for access and a cleverly
designed set of parallelogram-types lifts for the edges and you'd have
just about the same set of capabilities as a cylinder-type lift.  Of
course, now you've added considerable excavation and concrete work to
the job (although a lift might add as much for cylinder installation).

Other things to consider:

     sheet metal brake (if you do a fair amount of sheetmetal work)
     bead roller       (ditto)
     hydraulic press
     recirculating solvent parts washer
     drill press  (Craftsman has a new bench-mount radial under $300)
     Lots of parts/supplies storage (bins, shelves, and such)

Enjoy the shop.

The rear tires on my '81 911SC is worn out after less than 10,000 miles

series one Comp T/A on the car and the new Comp T/A's looked the same as the
old ones, but are apparently different. The Porsche service person told me
that mixing the old and new tires was not approved by the factory and showed
me a factory bulletin to back up that claim.  Since I only had the two rear
tires, I drove home with the mixed pair.  Somehow I felt the car wander a
bit.  Is it my imagination (there was also strong crosswinds), or the tire
mismatch caused the erratic tracking?  I would appreciate hearing from

Don't forget to disconnect the battery cable to the starter and the
transmission ground strap.  When I lowered my 914 engine, I forgot about
the ground strap and the weight of the engine/transmission broke the strap.

I used a floor jack to lower the engine.  I bolted a section of 2x4 to the 
swivel
cup on the jack for added support/stability.  If I remember right, after I 
got the
engine down, I had to jack the back of the car up even higher so that I 
could
roll the engine/tranny out the back.  Block the front wheels VERY securely.
The car will be at quite an angle when you do this.

Ooooh baby!  I'll let Miq Millman simply describe his setup, which 
encapsulates the very meaning of the word "sybaritic," but I'll
add a few things I've used and/or wished for.

~ Stuff I am planning on;
~ 
~ 	Verticle air compressor - only question is how big??

Forget vertical -- mount a 2000-gallon tank under the floor. :-)
The obvious answer is to get the biggest one you can afford.  For
a permanent installation, use pipe (NOT plastic PVC tubing!) to run 
the air to various locations around the garage/shop.  I don't plan
to be in my house for that long (of course, we moved here almost
six years ago with the intention of finding a bigger place within
a year -- life is what happens while you're making other plans),
so I just have a 25-gallon roll-around compressor and lots of hose
and extension cords.  For those of you who do a lot of work without
air tools: BUY THEM.  NOW.  You'll never go back.

~ 	Hoist - steel framed to move engines etc.
~ 
~ Stuff I have thought of;

A good, LARGE parts washer, permanently mounted as though it were
a big sink.  Then you recirculate your solvent of choice (mineral
spirits work really well) for basic use.  You'll want to set up a
petcock of some kind at the bottom for draining the old solvent
when it gets too slimy; my sit-on-the-bench parts washer requires
that I pick it up and dump it out, and that's a pain.  Make sure
the parts washer is large enough to get significant engine bits
into; for 900-series cars, you'll want to get the crankcase halves
into the liquid, I'd guess.

Lots of flat space to set things on, and lots of cabinet space to
store tools, cans of stuff, and supplies when you're not using them.

Lots and lots and lots of light.  A minimum of four, probably more
like six overhead fluorescents (I've got four in a standard 2-car 
garage, and it's adequate with enough drop lights), and some 
extra tubes right over the bench area.

If you were REALLY nuts, you could mount shower-curtain like rings
around part of the shop and use that as an easy-up paint booth.  You
should then, of course, rig up your ventilation to take this into
account, as well as plumbing it for the permanent air installation.

A big sink for washing up is essential.  Our utility sink has separate
taps for hot and cold water; I hate that, as the hot tap gets too hot
(especially with sore hands) just about the time I really need to get
the last of the gunk off.  Make sure you can mix the water in a single
spigot.

Some of that rubberized flooring that you see in restaurant kitchens;
I'm going to pick up a few pieces of that one of these days, to stand
on while working.  The best kind looks like it's made up of sections
of hoses so you can see through it, and so that oil/solvents/whatever
that spill on it will drain through.  Set this in front of the bench
where you're likely to work while standing.

Cheap, easily washed garage chairs.  Sometimes you just HAVE to sit
down for a few minutes...

Some closed-cell foam for lying on concrete.  I've recently begun
using this (just shipping foam, about 1/8" thick) and it's made a
remarkable improvement in working under cars.  There's nothing as
nigglingly painful as rolling onto your knee and standing up just
as you realize there's a piece of kitty litter in the center of your
patella...

A good heating and ventilation system.  Depending on where you live,
it can be very nasty working in a cold garage in winter, and equally
nasty working in a sweatbox in August.  Plus you'll want to be able
to evacuate fumes, dust, etc. to keep it off/out of the cars.

What a wish list!  Good luck, and thanks for letting us contribute!

Maestro,
  Thanks very much for the phone call on oil.  For those interested, I've

depending on the city's local regulations.  

Here in Mtn. View, I believe we can take them to certain pickup spots or 
drop off spots by putting the oil in ONLY 1. gal. plastic containers.

I got around the mess by finding a local Firestone dealer who emptied the 
oil, and poured in 9 qts. of my own Kendall GT-1 oil for $10.00.  I'm 
going to keep using them.  Also, the Shell on Marsh Rd. in Atherton has a

I spoke to Clark Anderson, during the purchase of my '73 S telling him that

The turbo tensioners are fine.

Wayne,

     I had the same thoughts re my '83SC - was the problem really
fixed in '80, or to upgrade.  Stan convinced me to upgrade.

     No failure or *EXCESSIVE* noise had occured.  One of the
original tensioners was difficult to depress manually, the other
I could work with my thumb as you might work a computer joy-stick
button.  I don't know how stiff they should be, but I am glad I
changed them.  Again on Stan's recommendation, I changed the
rails also.  They were worn, and the retainer-clip portion broke
on two of them upon removal, indicating heat-caused brittleness.
I fished the pieces out of the sump using a mirror and whatever
worked to reach them - not a big problem.  I was a good day of
Wrecreational Wrenching :)

Subject: how much air? how much gas?

Concerning fitting of EFI systems... perhaps the resident
wizards could throw a little light on fuel/air metering techniques.

It seems the fuel system's goal is to put the exact right amount of gas in
the cylinders at all times.  There are second order considerations, e.g.
cold start (way rich), full power (a little rich), economy cruise (a
little lean), EPA test (gawd knows)... but the first order consideration
would be how much AIR the engine is breathing.  That should depend on rpm,
throttle opening, and the volumetric curve for the engine.  Many EFI
systems measure airflow directly, using flappers or hot wires;
some (and some mechanical systems) measure any two of rpm,
throttle position, or manifold vacuum, and "predict" the airflow from
those.  (I think the Porsche 911 mechanical system uses rpm/throttle, 
I know the Kugelfischer system on my BMW does).

So here's my question: what are the relative merits of
the various ways of measuring/estimating engine air flow?  I know of
modern cars on the road that use each of the above methods, and seem to
deliver good results.  Why, 20+ years into the EFI era, are there still
so many approaches in use?  And, is any of them notably better at things
that Porschephiles might value (um, I guess those might be power, power,
and power)?  (OK, let's add throttle response, driveability, and
reliability...)

Pete? Stan? Anybody?

I just had the water pump and thermostat replaced in my 88 924S.
The water temperature gauge now indicates about 95 C while in
steady state on the highway.  With the old pump the temperature
was about 85 C during cruise at 65mph.  The mechanic that changed
it said that it was common for the temperature to be higher with
a new pump and that it would eventually return to its old operating
temperature.  He did not know what physical phenomena would explain
this though.

Has anybody ever experienced this?

The two things that come to mind are that the cooling system was not
sufficiently bled or that new thermostats need a break in period
before they open fully.

Thanks Doug,

I have been meaning to post this same question for some time but
have never gotten around to it.  My car (88 924S) has the same problem.
It is caused by the glass coming unglued in the frame and then squeaking
as it moves in and out when the body flexes.  It gets very loud and
irritating when the weather is either cold or wet.  I have been
living with this for a year now but would really like to fix it.  I
have thought of trying to inject some glue into the dried out seal but
have never tried it.  If anyone has fixed this please tell us know how
it is done.

A Porsche?   :)

Actually, I'd say that for a compressor, you should keep it all in the family
and buy a VW compressor kit!  They sell for a little more than the price of a
stock engine, and work quite well (two cylinders are compressors, while two
are normal)  That way your whole shop could be "air cooled"!

I also agree with the trench w/ movable steel channels idea.  The only down
side is if you ever need to drop an engine.

You are not the only person who has had this idea--one of the requirements for
a house for me is that it has a big barn with enough space for a garage/shop, 
as well as a bicycle shop.

        5 hp should do the job nicely--if you get a stationary model, you 
can run hard line around your shop with several connects so that you needn't 
fumble around with long air hoses. While I am on the thought of air, you 
might want to add a sandblasting cabinet to the list. If you've never 
used one before, you won't even believe how much time you can save.

	If you are planning to build this from scratch, a pit might be a 
better idea, and the best part is you have to try REAL hard to drop your 
car on yourself. Be sure to include steps that are long enough so that 
you can get out if the unthinkable happens.

	You will find that it is rather easy to install a spray booth if 
you are thoughtful about how you build your shop, you should be able to 
build a frame that will accomodate a temporary setup(read plastic 
drop cloths) unless you paint autos for a living :-).

The A model and T-5 B model tank floor.

The front of the battery box for the A model.

 - Pushrod tube seals are a good idea.
 - Does your clutch need replacing?
 - Does your tranny need new syncros?

Hi Ed,

The amswer is simply one of development. The object has always been to 
put exactly the right amount of gas into the combustion chamber to match 
the air entering it. Early engines used carburettors which were right at 
perhap 10 or 20 places in the engines cycle. Mechanical injection systems 
got better power by being able to atomise the fuel better but the fuel 
control was still a compromise. Later carburettor and mechanical 
injection systems used analogue computers to control the fuelling to get 
closer to the ideal requirements ie L jetronic from Bosch. 
Microprocessors and electronic injectors allowed the adjustment of 
fuelling and timing to very close tolerances comparatively cheaply and 
their biggest advantage was in the span of control from very rich at 
cold start to very lean under light throttle cruise.

This led to the development of sensors which could identify exhaust 
content, ignition quality (pinging) engine temperature and other things 
which would be simply impossible in a mechanical system. Newer 
microprocessors are simply working faster and with more accuracy so that 
several things can be integrated into one control unit. eg traction 
control cutting engine sparks when the computer indicates an 
imbalance in driven wheel speeds from the ABS sensors 

The technology today is controlled as much by legislation as anything 
else and the fact that the 911 can still get away with mechanical 
injection and meet EPA requirements is a testimony to its development as 
much as its ability to stay on the road with the engine where it is. The 
new OBD II legislation which states that the injection system has to 
store faults and indicate sensors STARTING TO FAIL will eliminate 
mechanical systems completely.

Hope it helps

My questions are to more to the racing and mechanic/engineering set on the
P-files net....

Our '72 has a 3.2l motor and is used almost exclusively for Solo II
(Autocross).  While preparing it for the rules in SCCA ASP class, I removed
the nice big spoiler mounted cooler -- since the rules won't allow a vented
spoiler (also weight is a consideration).  As temperatures rise with the
summer AX season, our two driver car is starting to see some *HOT* oil temps
 -- upwards of 250 deg F.

Short of putting on another cooler (fender mounted, etc.), I'd like some
advice on a couple of things:

I've been told that the 3.2L motors were actually designed to run at higher
temps and 250 deg shouldn't worry me (it does).  I am already running
synthetic oil, so I think the oil is still ok -- what about seals, etc.?  If
250 is ok then what *IS* too hot??

I have seen people open their engine covers and while the motor is idling,
spray a mist of water out of a tank sprayer directly into the fan.  I can
only imagine what the quick cooling is doing to the cylinders and heads,
etc.  But then again what about when you're driving on a hot day and a
summer rain hits you -- isn't that the same shock cooling?

If I just let the motor idle -- even when the temp is up at 250, is this
helping cool the hotter parts or just baking the motor more?

Subject: 911 SC valve noise


I have just purchased my first Porsche, a 79 911 SC Targa with 90K mi.
My local Porsche mech and I just performed a complete tune.  After the engine 
warmed up we noticed #6 intake still clacks like it needs adjusting.  It is 
intermitent . It happens mostly with any throttle above idle, once the engine returns to
idle it goes away.  We rechecked the adjustment hot and readjusted (it was a little loose).
The noise is still there.  The mech thinks it might be the elephant ear on the valve
adjusting screw.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

thx

Steve,
	Plexiglass and Lexan differ in that lexan is about 20X harder than 
plexi, and a lot more expensive.  It is only slightly more resistant to
scratching than plexi, but Lexan has much better shatter resistance.
BTW, Plexiglass is an actual brand name, which has
become synonymous with both polycarbonate materials and acrylic materials.
VW used plexi windows in certain models of the bus as far back as the
early '50s.  

Hope I was of help,

I was obviously hallucinating. I thought that base price was in that range. 
With my job situation fluctuating, the closest that I have come to a 993 
was to give the thumbs up to the 9 or 10 that I have seen so far on the 
road. A call to Paul Miller Porsche in Parsippany, NJ cleared up my 
misconceptions. Per the salesperson over the telephone, 993's are being 
sold at about 3% discount from list. All coupes between $60K and $67K, with 
$64K being average. They are not dealing and you will have to wait til July 
for Tiptronic and October for 6 spd tranny; ie. none in stock.

Subject: Leaking Rear Hatch on 924 Turbo

Hello P-philers,

Help!  I have a really vexing problem that I bet others have 
had and solved before me.  I have an '82 931 (e.g. 924 
turbo) that I have just restored.  Included in the 
restoration was a new rear hatch seal.  It seems to be 
properly installed.  Before, and now after installation of 
the new seal, water seeps (pours?)in around the outside 
lower hatch pin area below the spoiler where the little 
"scuppers" are.  I have tried everything to stop this flow, 
but without success.  Tightening the compression of the 
hatch catches does not solve the problem, it just makes the 
hatch harder to close.  BTW, I believe the rear hatch on my 
931 is the same as those on all 924s and 944s, at least 
through 1985(1/2).

Can anyone give me any advice on this problem?

Thanks,

Jim Fry

I found out about this from my mechanic (who does the stuff on the
944 I'm not setup for).  Knowing that I do a lot of my own work, he
said that Porsche now recommends that you _do_not_ use anti-seize
anywhere in the intake track and a good amount of the exhaust.  

The reason is that there is something in anti-seize that attacks
the oxygen sensor, causing early failure.

Along the same line, silicon should be avoided for the same reason -
this goes especially for things like the rubber intake boots.

Lexan is safe, and is stronger (harder to shatter).

The best I've found for working under the car is cardboard, just plain 
thick cardboard like a refrigerator is shipped in. I have a couple of 
3x6' pieces that I use. They absorb oil and other liquids, and you can 
slide on them for those low spots. Best of all, when it gets pretty 
grimy, you just chuck it and get a fresh one. 

As for your shop, don't forget a small fridge for beer, and a decent

Subject: Squeak from 944 hatch area


One source of squeaks is simply misadjusted latches.  I have to adjust
mine periodically (by loosing the jam nut and adjusting the length of
the latch prong until the hatch "just" latches).

Another source is, indeed, the glass beginning to separate from the
frame.  This makes more of a "clicking" or "scratching" sound than a
"squeak" (won't it be great when we have a multimedia Porschephiles so
that we can hear each other's problems :-)).  John Paterek (PCA
restoration expert) discussed this problem a few years ago in a
Panorama article.  I vaguely recall that the solution involved
removing the hatch and sealing the area with epoxy, but did not
require a complete remount.  If no one else posts the answer, I will
look up the article.

Pits are illegal in Massachusetts, reason being that exhaust gases tend 
to drop into them and render the mechanic useless.  Of course, if the 
building inspector doesn't know, who's to stop you?

An above ground surface mount electric one is relatively cheap and easy 
to install, plus safer than a pit.

They should behave like your GTI, with one exception.  The fans have 
two speeds.  Are you sure you're not mistaking the slow, silent speed 
for the "off" state?  Next time the fans are running and you kill the

David,

When my engine was out, I replaced all of the hoses on the top-side and
all of the fuel injection gaskets/o-rings.  I also replaced the wires
and plugs.  The push-rod tubes were done after the engine was in the
car.  I didn't have an engine stand, so it was easier that way.  You
may want to retorque the heads while the engine is out since the top
bolts are inaccessible otherwise.  But then again, since the top bolts
are exposed to the air, rather than immersed in oil as are the bottom
ones, they usually don't loosen.  Good luck!

I took my '84 944 to a highly recommended auto body man in the Seattle area,
Marv Engstrom, for a leaky hatch.  He said that it was common for the glass to
come loose from its frame.  My hatch had been improperly resealed using
silicon calking.  Marv resealed it using a black sealant that has a consistency
more like butyl rubber than silicon.  I don't know anything more about it than
that, though.

Marv told me that the rubber hatch seal (the part that the hatch closes
against on the body) was old and may need replacing to
completely waterproof the hatch.  As it continued to leak, I had the dealer
replace the seal.  It still leaked, so I tried to tighten the locking pins.
They were frozen.  I wondered why neither Marv nor the dealer told me
about the frozen pins.  I thought that adjusting them would be part of a
hatch repair project.  At any rate, I purchased new pins and adjusted them
as tight as I could and still be able to get the hatch to close and latch.  The
leak is almost completely gone.  I will tighten them a bit more after the seal
has had some time to take a set.  Hopefully it will be watertight then.

If others have had leaking hatches that they have fixed with additional
procedures, please let me know about the remedy.

Subject: Paul Moruzzi's Garage


I'm also designing a garage.  Many previous suggestions were good.  I'd 
add more space in back even if it meant just being able to get a 
car in sideways, 
limiting the number of posts, adding several 240 outlets, making sure you 
have lots of wall outlets and even some ceiling ones.

A separate area to paint would be very smart, especially with adequate 
ventilation.  I would paint the floor with epoxy or polyurethane.  I 
would have some heat if you are in a cold climate.  I would put in 
insulated doors, and if possible, even have one bay a drive through.  A 
separate room, or even loft for parts storage would be desirable.  A good 
deep sink with hot and cold running water should be a must.

Re the built in air compressor and piping, make sure you provide outlets
above the pipe bottom, and allow for water to drain out (via valves) 
at the bottom of each vertical pipe.  Eastwood several years ago 
published a good pamphlet on this. 

I don't like pits.  They're too fixed, and have the disadvantages of not 
having sufficient lighting as well as not being able to move the car up 
and down.  Besides, you know you're going to grab a 13mm wrench, go down 
into the pit, and then discover you instead needed a 12mm.  There are 
several lifts on the market which are made for the home garage, and don't 
require either super high ceilings or additional floor strength.  Prices 
vary from $2K to about $4K, plus freight, etc. I can dig out the specs 
and sources if anyone is interested.

Other concerns would include the benefits of natural light vs. security, 
separating daily drivers which get wet and dirty from projects, where to 
place equipment such as hoists, etc.  

Perusing the Eastwood and Griots catalogs should give you plenty of other 
ideas.  Good luck and keep us abreast of how the project goes.

    Okay, I have the makings of what most people dream about for the
     ideal Porsche garage, actually 2 buildings (35x65 ft and 35x45 ft)
     left over from life as a family construction company and now shared
     between an active family. As such I can offer;

   1. what to have;
      -Outlets everywhere on lots of breakers
      -lighting in every corner
      -ventilation in a big way
      -usable shelves and cabinets
      -jacks/jack stands; those $29 hydraulic jacks are great, get the
        ones with handles (to carry around the shop). Get only "Cast"
        jackstands, I have have a welded-type fail once while jacking up the
        car.
      - building a paint booth is another story, if you want a prayer
        you need awesome amount of light and massive ventilation. That and
         a ceiling that you can wash easily (exposed rafters will hold way too
         much dust which will always rain down on your car right before your
         clear coats).

   2. What not to have in your workshop; this becomes more critical year by   
       year:
       - cars that you never work on
       - furniture you'll never use
       - motors you have no car for
       - anything you bought a replacement for (eg. cores you never 
           bothered to return, axles that broke, old brake shoes, etc).
       - 3 1/2 sets of Craftsman tools (one complete set is fine)
       - 1/8th-full cans of paint
       - tools that quit working
       - bags of cement
       - any lumber, dead bicycles, lawnmower parts, old carpet, anything

I've been watching all this talk of a pit instead of a lift, but
there is one thing that I would want the lift for that the pit
just won't do for:  Anything where major bits of the suspension
are to be removed.  You can't even remove all the wheels when you're
using a pit.

I vote for the lift.  It's also harder to fall/drive into. 8-)

With respect to this, I would also get some of those spiffy exhaust 
hose attachments that most the shops around here use, basically they're 
long piece of plastic hose, like from the back of a dryer, that vent to 
the outside. So you slide them over your exhaust pipe, the idea being 
that you don't need to have the garage open to do work with the engine running.

Pits are illegal in Massachusetts, reason being that exhaust gases tend 
to drop into them and render the mechanic useless.  Of course, if the 
building inspector doesn't know, who's to stop you?

An above ground surface mount electric one is relatively cheap and easy 
to install, plus safer than a pit.

I've tried that.  Yes, it's good to put under drips and leaks, and in
a pinch it's okay, but it compresses after the first good squish and
then it's no more protection than a couple sheets of paper.  What I
like best about the closed-cell foam is that it never seems to bottom
out, especially where there are two layers.

A ratty piece of carpet isn't bad, but it tends to collect, um,
denizens when you're not actually rolling around on it.  And I
wouldn't mind rolling around *under* a Spyder, but I don't like
rolling around on *top* of them.

I suppose one day I'll get a lift or at least some really high jack
stands and then I can use a creeper.  

Oh, if I didn't already mention it, ramps work (in my recent experience)
far better than jackstands, at least for jobs that don't require having
the wheels off.  Putting the car up on the ramps gives you the normal
ground clearance (all 4" or so of it; sometimes I wish I liked 4 x 4s)
plus the height of the ramp.  (You know you like sports cars when you
need a two-stage jacking system: the first one raises the car high
enough for you to roll the floor jack under the frame rails...)  I 
used the jack to raise the car, then slipped the ramps under the wheels,
but then this was to install the engine mounting bolts after dropping
a new motor into the chassis, so driving it on the ramps was out of
the question -- even if ground clearance would have permitted it.

As for 4 x 4s, once I was helping push a friend's Sprite into place on 
the lawn for a club meet.  Sprites weigh something like 1400 pounds with
fluids, and I commented to the owner, "Aren't you glad we aren't in the
Chevy Suburban club?"

Ah, that's it.  We're into reduce, reuse, recycle at the Grizzlies
From Hell Race Shop, Brewery, and Child Development Centre. :-)

Seriously, from a position of pure comfort, I have to say that the
1/8" foam has made a dramatic improvement in my attitude while working
in the garage.  

On the other hand, someone suggested linoleum in the shop.  Is that
to keep concrete dust from getting into the engine, or is there some
other reason as well that makes it a good floor for workshops?

The only way that I could justify it, would be if the IRS decides that $65K 
cars are fully deductible for someone who drives to work 1 day a week, 
maximum. In all seriousness, I aspire to an air-cooled boxer like an '89 
C4. They are in the $30-40K range now and might be doable on a lease. An RS 
America would be even nicer. I'm real happy with the '86 951 though, and 
doubt that I can get 5X the performance in a C4. The shopping for the '87

Sigh.... My shop, shared with two other semi-pros and Elmer Fohey, has

200 square foot office with couches, fridge, desk, microfiche reader,
water cooler, and a zillion manuals...
Two compressors -- one 20 HP, one 35 HP, both 220V, with hard-line 
distribution to most of the shop
tons of air tools
Sun distributor machine
MIG/TIG/electric arc/oxy-acetylene welders, including gas and plasma
cutters
bead blaster
two parts washers
tire mounter, shaver, and balancer
engine assembly room with steel-top benches, etc.
unit room with drill press, lathe, mill
cherry picker and a-frame hoists
overhead loft parts storage (30 foot ceilings)
eight 2.5 ton floor jacks
various specially fabricated jigs that make working on 911 and 914 racers
muuuuch easier
huge investment in Craftsman, Snap-on, Heyco, Hazet, Mac, Matco etc.

We usually have 6 or so in at any given time... I also have off-site
warehousing for 6 other cars

What's missing: chassis dyno, engine run-in room and dyno (need *HEAVY*
reinforcement in case engine goes "boom"), on-site CAD design
and tubing cutting setup, fiberglass room.

But we have access to all that stuff via other arrangements....

Mis-installation. Or bad heads (i.e. the top surface of the boss was
worn/machined/etc down too much so that the guide protruded), but
that counts as mis-installation as someone should have noticed.

Other possibility -- slight mis-installation having valve moving
not quite at the right angle up and down, wore guide to the point
that it flexed in the boss, and dropped down.o`

Yet other possibility - wrong part for valve or guide or both. Racer
types may use say TRW or Manley or similar instead of Alfred Teave's

When taking cars form Ghost Racing to Transformers (the Offical Paint and Body
Shop of Ghost Racing), we take the CVs off at the wheels and don't deliver the 
halfshafts with the car. Deliver it as a "roller" and your body shop will like
you; deliver it where they can't roll it around, and they'll regret ever
seeing you... We usually trailer the cars over, but have been known to
use flatbed wreckers, tow dollies, and other mechanisms.

OK, this is the hard part..... strip the car 100% (almost). For sure, take
out the interior, the carpet, the insulation and sound deadening, all
the loose stuff, etc. Check *EVERYTHING* for rust, get it all done at once.
You *DO NOT* need chassis reinforcing for a "normal" 4-to-6 conversion.
YOu can often wind up with *WORSE* rust after doing so -- the rosette welds
you make to install it are hard to rust-proof, and you can't seal out all of
the moisture under the plates. They're OK for racers, which have short
lifespans anyway, but not for street cars you want to keep for a while...

You *DO* need to make some hard decisions -- should it look stock, or should
it look "converted" (if you don't use the stock oil tank, you save
a zillion dollars and get better oil cooling; you do however lose the
front trunk to the oil tank, cooler, etc.). 

You need to talk to people who have done this -- H.G. Bieker comes to mind,
as does George Vellios, the Anderson brothers, etc (and of course, Ghost
Racing...)  It's a *REAL* bitch to do and make look factory, and almost
as much trouble (and certainly as much money) to do and make it look
"modern"/"custom"/etc i.e. anything but like a race car. On the other hand,
it's cheaper to do than lots of things if you're building a race car...

Good advice, Pete, but I would change "repaint the engine shrouds" to "have
all the engine tin stripped and powder coated".  Powder coating is much more
durable than paint; just be careful that you don't dent the tin after it has
been coated or else you will run the risk of cracking the enamel.

Well...it sounds like your valve springs are shot and the valves were 
floating and slamming the valves down on the seats.  On good valve springs,
when the valve closes, the spring pulls the valve shut and holds it shut.
When the springs go bad, the valves bounce when they hit, since the spring
does not have enough tension to hold the valve down.  This will trash a 
set of valve seats *really* quickly and result in costly repairs.  I know 
that on VWs, it is a good idea to replace springs and guides about every
50,000 miles (having the seats reground is also a good idea), and 356s are
really damn similar to VW engines

Lexan is one tradename for polycarbonate.  Plexiglas is one tradename

Polycarbonate is far superior to acrylic in impact resistance and
you can use thinner sheets for glass replacement than with acrylic.
Those 1/2" thick sheets at the bank teller window are typically

BUT, beware:  Polycarbonate has an achilles heel -- chemical resistance.
For instance, spray a little bit of Brake cleaner on it and watch it

Subject: 911 front shocks; Koni shocks


Hi everyone -

I found out what changes were made to the 911's front struts (Boge) in 4/85. 
 (Special thanks goes to David and Mark at RD Enterprises)  It seems that in 
April, the Boge strut housing went from having internal threads on the 
housing to having external threads (the "nut" that secures the insert went 
from male to female threads).  Apparently the dimensions of the strut insert 
changed a little also (I believe it lengthened a slight amount).  According 
to RDE, Koni kits for the front use the same insert, but include both types 
of nuts and the required spacers.  Boge simply makes two different front 
insert kits, the newer version being about $10 - $15 more.  I believe 
Bilstein makes two different kits, but for a while, they did not agree with 
Boge on the month during which the changes were made.  KYB only makes a 
version for the pre-4/85 cars, but presumably they will fit the newer cars 
with the help of a spacer and newer nut.

Whew!!  The moral of all of this:  If you have an '85 911, you may want to 
check to see which type of strut you have.  If you have a 2/85 - 5/85 911, 
you should definitely do this to save some possible grief.  I have a 4/85 
car, so I wasn't about to take any chances.

Also, I'm getting ready to put a set of 29mm torsion bars on my car (Got 
them free).  I also need to replace shocks, but my experience has been that 
it is the shock that usually contributes the most to an unacceptably-stiff 
ride.  What is everyone's experience with the red Konis.  How soft is full 
soft?  20%-50% stiffer than stock?  How about the Bilsteins?  Boge Turbo 
gas?  The KYBs are out of the question because I don't want to try to make 
them fit in the front.  Enquiring minds whant to know - fast!  Please reply 
directly if possible.

I have an '87 944S and I was wondering if it would be possible to put some
50-series tires (preferably some BFG Comp TA 255/50R15s) on it.  The factory
recommends only 215/60 series.  I have some Pirelli HPs on the car now, and
they're in good shape and adquately sticky for the daily commute, but I'm going
to want something more, just because.  Also, would it be possible to put some
16" wheels on this car?  It looks like there should be enough room inside the
wells, but I haven't really measured or anything.  I'm also concerned that I
might need bigger anti-sway bars if I go to bigger/stickier tires.

Next, I was wondering if it would be worth my while to replace the stock
rubber bushings on the anti-sway bars with urethane bushings.  I've heard that
significant gains can be achieved through this, but this was from Firebird
owners, whose cars handled like shopping carts anyway.  If this would be
helpful, can anyone recommend a supplier?

Oh, and does anyone have any experience with these new carbon/kevlar brake
pads I heard about?  Is that what the Cool Carbons are?  They sound very
interesting...

Thanks for any and all advice!

All parts must be in sync together.  The balance shafts don't balance 
each other (in which case removing both would leave things balanced 
too!), they damp the crank vibrations.

Subject: Brake questions - best fluid, pads ?

Just a couple of quick questions (requests for opinions).

Background:  This is for an '87 911, daily driver with occasional :-) spirited
driving and a couple of drivers ed events a year and hopes toward doing a 
couple of auto-crosses.

What do people feel is the best brake fluid ? Castrol LMA ?
I was wondering about a silicon based fluid, but am wary of silicon fluids
as I hear silicon fluids may have a tendency to destroying some parts if it 
leaks.  Anyway, what fluid would you recommend ?

Also, what pads do you recommend.  Of course I have heard of Cool Carbons,
and Repco Metal-Masters.  But considering that this is my daily driver
I wonder what people think is the best pad for me ?

Finally, I was thinking of doing all the work myself and being pretty much of
a novice mechanic, are there any gotchas.  I assume I can flush the brake 
system with the help of my SO and don`t need the brake bleeding tool.  Do
I need to get a tool to spread the calipers ?  

While flipping through my catalogs (Imparts, Performance Products etc..) I also
notice that they have brake warning sensors.  Do I need to replace these
sensors when I change the pads or can I re-use the ones that are already
there ?

Any help, tips on flushing brakes, changing brake pads, greatly appreciated.

The balance shafts definitely need to be synched with the cam/crank to
work properly with the engine running, but you won't hurt anything by
leaving the belt off while you crank the engine by hand (with the cam
belt installed and timed correctly, of course).  In principle, I don't
see any problem doing what you propose.  I would just be sure to do a
final tension check on both belts before buttoning up the covers.

BTW, if your question is motivated by difficulty in finding a good
place to attach the tension tool on the cam belt with the balance belt
also installed, I solve this problem by temporarily removing the upper
idler pulley (which has no bearing on the belt tension) to make room
for the tool on the belt.

I have just returned from my vacation in Spain and I thought I would give

Nick did not have vary good luck at the Supercar race held in conjuction
with the Spanish Grand Prix. He got hit early in the race and ended up 
in the Sand. He couldn't get out of the sand without help so he was not able
to finish the race. I wasn't able to see Nick at the race as it was 
impossible to gain access to the Paddock. They have tighted up security 
since Senna's death in Italy. I have spoken with Nick since I returned and
found out he Finished 9th at Italy and 6th at Monaco.

As far as the rest of the series goes, Nick is still looking for sponsors
but things are looking better for him to continue for the rest of the
year. If you have any leads on possible sponsors give him a call at the
number listed in Pano.

Don't forget that the Supercar race in Monaco is on ESPN 1 tonight at 11:00PM

Forgive my ignorance - but what exactly are "Turbo" tensioners?
Is this the same tensioner design that was introduced in 1980?
My car had the latest "SC" style tensioners installed about 15k 
miles ago and I am curious whether the recent threads about
the "Turbo tensioners" apply to mine...

Thanks,

Mike Dayton
- ---------------------------------------------

Turbo tensioners are not oil feed but are a robust mechanical
improvement of previous tensioners. Carrera tensioners use oil pressure
to modulate the chain tension. If you have new plumbing installed to
feed oil to the chain cover unit, then you have the Carrera
tensioners.

I believe the 1980 tensioner improvement is just the more robust
mechanical tensioner.

You can certainly put 16" wheels on-I did it on my '88 944. Just be sure you 
have the correct offset. Wheels for '86 and earlier 944s will not be 
correct. I don't think you necessarily need to change the bars just because 
of different tires. In fact, I was surprised to find out that my car had 
some of the largest ones(27 mm and 18 mm) already on it from the factory.

Apparently pits are legal here in Washington state as I recently had the
oil changed in the Volvo (since sold) at one of those quick oil-lube
chain stores.  They had a pit in each bay.  I didn't notice what sort
of ventilation they had, but proper forced ventilation would remove
any potential CO accumulation hazards.

| An above ground surface mount electric one is relatively cheap
| and easy to install, plus safer than a pit.

Most of the (relatively) inexpensive surface mount lifts I have seen use
a pair of channels to lift the wheels, so the wheels cannot be removed.
These are similar to what you see in a muffler shop.  I have seen
surface mount hydraulic lifts whose lift points are under the chassis, but
they were quite beefy in construction and probably not cheap.
If you know of reasonably priced surface mounting chassis grabbing lifts,
I (and I am sure other P-philes) would be interested in brand and cost
information.

Regarding the discussion about what to lay on while working under
the car, I recently bought a creeper.  I now wonder why I waited so
long!  I'll never go back to laying on carpeting (the old method).
Although I loose an inch and a half or so of vertical clearance using
the creeper, the extra effort in jacking the car a bit higher is more than
offset by the reduction in working effort the creeper affords.  I always
find that I don't have all of the tools in need after I get under the car.
Crawling out to get that wrench was a pain.  Rolling out on the
creeper is a breeze.  Besides, I don't have to worry about dripping
oil or grease on the carpet.  Since I generally try to avoid pouring
oil on myself, it usually doesn't get on the creeper either.  And if I
do get some crud on the creeper, it wipes clean with a rag.  This
particular creeper is a solid piece of injection molded plastic
with the outer edges raised.  It is under the raised edges that the
six casters are mounted, so the body supporting area is quite low.
I don't remember the brand, but could get it if anyone is interested.

Funny I should receive this mail a few minutes after sending
my message about my hatch leak.

I thought I would mention two things that are in addition to
what I mentioned in my previous mail.  First, I was told that
the hatch can be relocated front to back about 2 or 3 mm
because the hinge to body mount uses elongated holes.
Apparently the hatch can move back over the years and
then would need to be moved forward to get a snug
fit.  The body repair guy that worked on mine said that my
car apperently did not need this adustment.  I wonder if
he was right...

The other thing could be a major concern.  If the car had
been in an accident and suffered any significant body
damage; anything that could twist the body or alter the
hatch geometry, could produce permanent sealing
problems.  I don't think this is the case on my car since
it has all of the original decals (paint code, emissions
specs, etc), paint, and sound deadening, but one always
wonders...

Subject: 911 Pre-purchase results


The verdict is in on the 84.  Some little stuff (license plate lamp, 
sunvisor, power antenna not working, rear defogger switch may be 
defective).  My bigger concerns are:

1.  No air compressor for spare (how much $?)
2.  As predicted by many of you on the net - the A/C doesn't work (and 
fuse checks out ok; full of freon)  Approximations on repair?
3.  Transmission has been worked on.  Mech says used silicon sealant to 
close back up, not gasket, but tranny fluid level ok, no leaks and tranny 
fine mechanically (including synchros).
4.  Left cam line seeping oil (was not centerline seam in case).  Mech 
estimated $80 to fix and rest of engine tight.  Price sound right? 

That's it.  Anything strike anybody as a deal buster?  By the way, 
compression check came back 165 on all but #5, 170 on 5.  Compression 
ratio in book was 9.5:1. Suspension good.  Front/rear brakes 50%.  Clutch 
is "grabby." (supposed to be relatively new).  Tires about 50%. Axle 
boots ok.  Someone did put the wiper arms on backwards (grin).

So, to my cast of thousands of experts, what say you on this stuff?  I 
await your expertise with unwaivering anticipation!

Pressure creates heat, which is the whole point of compression
ratio that goes beyond 1:1 in the first place, and heat creates
additional pressure.  I'd have to say without disrespect that
Stan's compression ratio formula, while a good rule of thumb, is
a lot simpler than actual practice usually proves to be.  You
have to factor in the change in pressure with temperature, as
well as the cylinder's volumetric efficiency.  You should 
surely be in the ballpark with Stan's formula, and I've used
it as a quick guesstimate of a car's condition, but as a 
mathematical predictor it can be a little looser than that.

And since no one has brought it up yet, I'll ask how the old
wet-versus-dry test works with horizontally opposed motors?
In inline/V engines, you can further diagnose low compression-test
readings by squirting a few blasts of oil into the cylinder and
then re-running the test.  If a low reading goes up, the rings
are probably worn (the assumption is that the oil helps seal the
rings enough to bring up the test results).  If the reading doesn't
change much, then the low compression is the result of worn valves.
But I wonder how this would work in a flat six...

Actually, Stan's formula is correct only for isothermal compression.
John's formula is correct only by chance, if that. During operation
the pressure/compression relation approaches an adiabatic function,
which gives a fair amount more pressure because the work done during
compression turns into heat, raising the temperature of the charge.

During compression testing, the values fall somewhere in between -
the adiabatic peak pressure is a good bit higher than the isothermal
one, and a compression tester will generally show a value somewhat higher
than the isothermal value.

Subject: Re:   Compression Test Pressures

Dear Mr Butler:

       Ifin you recall your High School Thermodynamics, Compression is NOT
Isothermal, in which case the Pressure would be (CR-1)*atmosphere or
(CR-1)*14.7. (The -1 is there because say at sea level, pressure is 14.7 PSI
absolute. If compression were 10:1, and Isothermal,  the final pressure is
147 psia, which is 147-14.7 psig or 132.3 psi GAUGE.   (we read psig or gauge
pressure on gauges. Psi Gauge= psia-14.7..

   HOWEVER, this is all WRONG, as compression is NOT Isothermal, nor
Adiabatic, but somewhere in between. If Adiabiatic (isentropic) the pressure
 is the compression ratio raised  to the 1.4 power (the ratio of Specific
Heat at Constant Pressure to the specific head at Constant Volume. Sound
familar?

    However,  like I said, Compresion is NEITHER exactly Isothermal nor
adiabatic, but in effect the power is greater than 1. (usually about 1.3)
THIS is why your measured compression is HIGHER than what you'd get by
multiplying 14.7 by your compression ratio-1.
     Oh, and the Cam used makes a difference. If you're using a High
Performance cam with late-closing intake valve, compression readings will be
low at slow speeds used for compression tests. A 1600 Normal can have higher
compression than a Racer! 
   Isn't Science wonderful?

The surest sign is gas in your oil. Take off the oil filler
cap and sniff - if it smells strongly of gas, there's a 
problem.

Another symptom can be backfiring when you let off the gas
(after checking that CO is correct)

Before you jump to conclusions about the pump, though, check
the pump timing and belt. It's done with a mirror, back behind
the MFI pump. There are lines on the sprocket and the flange
on the pump body that should line up when the FI line on the
fan pulley is lined up. To adjust timing, you loosen the 
sprocket, rotate until the lines coincide, and tighten again,
To tighten the belt, you have to loosen 4 nuts and move the 
whole pump. It's nearly impossible to do with the engine in 
the car - but if the pump belt is loose for a long period of
time it will wear the teeth on the cogged pulley and slip
back and forth as you accellerate or decellerate, causing
the same symptoms as a bad pump. The belt will eventually
fail ($$flatbed home)

Generally (IMHO) the cause of drivability problems is worn
or misadjusted throttle bodies. Either air leaks around worn 
shafts and causes problems, or the linkage gets sloppy and 
the throttle plates flutter or pull closed, causing very
irritating drivability problems. 

Improperly tuned MFI (too rich or too lean on either idle
or midrange) or leaky injectors can mimic virtually all 
other problems, so a good tune-up by someone familiar with
Porsche MFI is the place to start. (hard-earned knowlege
from a stubborn Swiss)

No Stan, you got it right - most compression testers give relative pressure.
This means that the first 15psi are not measured by the tester. However,
as I noted in my previous message, the pressure in cylinder at TDC is somewhere
in between the isothermal value obtained by your formula, also written as

P2   V1
- -- = --
P1   V2

for absolute pressures - 14.5psi being an estimate of normal air pressure
at sea level, and of course you have to subtract it to get the relative
reading that a compression tester will show, and the idiabatic value, given
by the formula:

P2   /V1\ ^ gamma     (that's V1 over V2, raised to the power of gamma,
- -- = |--|              in Macsyma-impaired ASCII)
P1   \V2/

For air/gasoline stoichiometric mix, gamma is about 1.4, so this yields
an absolute pressure of 329psi absolute, or 314psi relative for a CR of 8.9.
The value of pressure noted (145) is on the low side, indicating that
there is a substantial amount of loss due to a combination of factors:

1) thermal loss to the piston, cylinder, and head during compression stroke
   at compression testing speeds (usually significant)

2) pumping losses due to valve timing (eg intake or exhaust valve not closing
   at BDC during compression stroke (also usually significant)

3) blowby at the rings or leak-by at the valves or leakage through cracks
   in the cylinder, piston, or head (hopefully negligible).

the squealing once in a while by turning the a/c off and on, but it eventually 
starts
screeching again. I'm guessing right now that the fan itself is probably beyond

I wish I could ignore this problem, but Houston heat and humidity makes for

We covered this a year or so ago -- it DOES NOT work for flat engines.
It is *sometimes* useful on vertical or V engines, but a leakdown

Subject: Targa roof alignment

Dear Porschephiles,

Some time ago I inquired about adjusting Targa folding roofs on this E-mail
network.  The response was that it could not be done, but if I found out,
to share the Porsche Pearls with you. 

The Targa roof is indeed designed to make adjustements. The Porsche factory
manuals, while listing roof parts and expected dimensions, advise you to
make these adjustments, but they lack instructions on how to.

I got very sound instructions from Tony at Auto International, Cidros Ave.,
Solona Beach, CA (619) 481-1603.  It so turned out, that the Targa top I
had sent for restoration to a well-known, nationally advertised Porsche
dealer  (whose catalogue takes pride in a frame esepecially constructed for
Targa roof restorations to factory specs) was sent on to Tony.  But said
dealer was also honest enough not to take credit for excellent work he had
not done.

Receiving the rebuilt Targa roof my problem was that the front edge (lip)
of the  roof was pulled too deeply into the car (below the roofline) when I
looked the Targa roof into place.  Tony's simple solution: open up the
hooks (4 of them) along the front edge of the roof headliner that engage
the roof frame as the folding steel frame springs into tension.  To gain
access to the front (or rear) hooks, the steel frame must be collapsed as
is done in folding the roof.  Some washers can also be placed under the
hooks to raise the roof from the roof frame.  Alternatively, somewhat
larger hooks, which Tony can send you, can be installed (on option I have
exercised). The front edge of my Targa roof now lines up perfectly with the
roofline of the car.  

As to other Targa roof adjustements, e.g fitting the roof to the windows,
Tony told me (and I have confirmed) that the left and right rubber seals of
of the Targa roof (against which the raised windows press), are designed to
have considerable play for adjustement.  Simply losen the four Phillips
screws sunk deeply into the rubber seal in order to move the seal in a
forward, backward, or lateral direction.  In the case of my restored Targa
roof I had to completely losen the Phillips screws and gently break the
glue at the front and rear edges of the seal. The seal then came right off
(to reveal the rain gutter underneath).  The seal was then reinstalled
losely to allow motion.  The Targa roof was then placed into to car.
Sitting inside I then positioned and tightened the seal in place (to butt
evenly against the entire window edge).

I had no problems with fitting the rear roof line to the Targa roll bar, so
I can not say much abot this - though the logic must be similar to that for
front alignments.  Call Tony, who seems to like talking to customers.

The Porsche manuals suggest applying liquid rubber compound to stuff final
leaks.  I use the stuff divers use for the repair of wet suits.

Finally, when adjusting the Targa roof, be sure the car stands on its
wheels.  Body flex is astonishingly different when  your joy sits on blocks
for pelvic exams.

Stick with a good DOT-4 fluid.  The DOT-5 and silicone (same thing?) fluids

  I found a pretty nice, relatively heavy duty, floor jack at Pep Boys
for about $80.  It worked great until I put the new springs on.  Now
I have to drive the car up on 2x6 blocks in order to get the car
high enough off the ground to get the jack under.  While prone to
problems, it was much easier to slide the little lift point adapter
into the slot on the SC where the jack didn't have to go under the car.

I own a set of ramps that I've had for about 10 years that work just
fine.  Yes, the 255's are a little wide, but I can center the car on them
well enough that I don't have any problem.  I do use 2x6 blocks to get the
car up high enough as to not rub on the ramp on the way up/down.  Oh, don't
forget to chock the front wheels just in case.  I found some nifty plastic
chocks at the local RV supply store ($3 a piece) that work great for this
purpose.

Hope this helps...

I just wanted to add that GE used to advertise Lexan as 'unbreakable'.
Even if they still do, don't believe it...I was in one of GE's labs when
a 4" thick viewing 'porthole' was trashed.  The lab manager sent the
broken piece with a 'nice little note' over to the Lexan division, since
it ruined the test (the Lexan porthole was NOT what was being tested).

Subject: Re: Lexan

~ 
~     Well gang, it looks like Lexan is the hands-down winner here for
~     a glass substitute.  My next question is:  What thickness?  1/8,
~     3/16, or 1/4?

For your rear window, 1/8" is easiest to shape.  I made a front
windscreen for my MGB roadster out of 1/8" Lexan; I fabricated
a cardboard mockup to shape and then had TAP plastics (a local
chain) cut it out and sand the edges smooth.  I'd left tabs for
the Dzus fasteners, which we had to bend to fit the plane of
the cowling when the screen was installed.  To bend those
tabs, you soften them with a heat gun, with immersion in hot
water, or in my case, with my wife's hair dryer on double-hot.
(That's also the right tool for getting the wrist pins in or out 
of MGB 18GB-GK four-ring pistons, should anyone here care. :-)

A fellow EP competitor, in his case driving an MGB-GT, replaced
the rear windows and the rear hatch glass with 1/8" Lexan.  Once
again, he found the 1/8" stuff much easier to bend to fit the
curvature of the backlight.  No heating was necessary there, as 
the large sheet is flexible enough as it is.  I'd recommend using
Dzus fasteners rather than pop rivets, for a number of reasons.
First of course is that they're simply too cool for words. Second
is that should a stone (or other impact) crack or damage your Lexan,
you can remove the old one with a screwdriver instead of a drill
and you can pop in a new one in seconds (once you fab it, of course).

1/8" is also lighter, if you're counting grams; it's not much but on
a really big window area it adds up.

BTW, I think I'd planned to remake my air dam out of Lexan as it was
so easy to work with and inexpensive, but I sold the car before that
day came.  My old aluminum air dam had torn in a number of places
and was basically suitable for use as nothing but a template...

Oh, one last comment: don't use Windex or any other ammonia-based
cleaner on lexan, or it will distort the surface and may weaken it.
(We had a pet door with a Lexan panel that a cleaning woman once
sprayed with Windex; it ended up looking like one of those
shower-door panels...)

  Hi gang, we back from a colo. vacation.  I'm unsubscribed and in deep lurk

  I've been driving the Saga of '76 to work nearly every day for the last
month, and been giving a lot of time and backache to tuning the four
barrels that feed my 2 liter GA.  This has been a moving, elusive target.
  I know, the Weber 40 IDF is far simpler mechanism than a Q-jet, but
with 4 of everything but floats, and crossbar linkage to adjust, I miss
more often than i hit.
  Some days are better than others too, after spending a whole evening
tuning to what seemed perfection, runs like shit the next morning till warm.
  And well, ya, tune it some more and now i lost my balance!
  I seem to have one cylinder (#3) with an attitude i'm not sure how to
adjust, but all else is in balance (even compression!).
  Start over again.  dumf*ck!

  Is there a better way?  (besides a swap to FI)

  I'm seeking greater precision..

deck lid, and twiddle the carbs while engaging in combat with the kansas

when negotiating crosswinds.   just kidding.  I couldnt reach #1,2.  

 -heh, heh what can i say..colorado was great, the mountains filter my soul.

  I'm cheep so building a sniffer from ox sensors is within my realm.

I'd also be interested in knowing what points to use for jacking from a 
floor jack.  One tire placed looked for 10 minutes then ended up jacking 
over some thick oil lines, promising to me it was safe, another place 
yesterday jacked up on the trailing arms, one corner at a time.

I have two 15*7 15" BBS RA wheels for sale with good rubber, and two 15*7 
16" BBS RA wheels, one is dented, but works. 

I am looking for two 16" tires with at least 5K miles on them to fit on 
16x7 Fuchs, pref. 205 * 50 or 195*50.

Also, what are the best brake pads to get for street/sport use?  I'm down

Thanks for all the advice. It seems that those who thought
it was normal with some pads were right -- I found no problems
with the caliper or pad-holding clips -- and the brakes seem
quieter now too.

When the wheel was off I checked for play in the halfshaft, and that gives
a noticeable click/clunk when pulled axially outward. Not loud or
too worrying, but I was surprised. No noticeable play rotationally
or radially, but around 1 1/2 " total axially. The left side also
has play, but is quiet. Any advice? Thanks.

Congratulations!
  BTW, Is Cognac Brown the only Porsche Brown color?  Have you found 
touch up paint anywhere for it?

I have see one other brown 911 around the south bay a couple of times, 
and the only distinguishing thing about it was it was a targa, and had 
black fuchs.  Now that I have black fuchs, it's going to be tougher.  

Does anyone know total # of brown 911's made, by year?  What do you think 
of Maaco's top of line Urethane $1000 paint job?  I know it's not 
equivalent to a 5K porsche paint job, but would it last for a few years, 
and stand up to the calif. elements ok?

Also, has anyone fixed a hard to turn window, it seems the window is just 
placed wrong on the drivers seat.  I've blown out the original crank, but 
have the $8.00 drill out fix, but the real source is the window is tough 
to crank up or down.  Down is easy, I just get it an inch down, then push 
down with my right hand, while my left hand does the crank, putting it up 
is tougher, I'm not going to hook up my ac, until I get an oil cooler, 
and it's hitting 100 degrees out here.  THanks..

To you 944 lovers out there, help out a neophyte.  I have a 1983 with=

                How can I be sure I get the best, recent-design mount=

2. With shift lever in neutral and clutch pedal up, I hear a faint gr=

3. When turning either way, I hear a high-pitched squeal that sounds =
like a
brake dragging.  Straight ahead, I hear brief identical squeals over =
bumps.
Haven't pulled the front wheels yet, but if this is just brake draggi=

4. The A/C was checked a few weeks ago, and I was told it was ok, but=
 it is

5. The A/C uses R-12 (?), the old CFC refrigerant.  Any word on "fixe=

Hope some of you have words of wisdom for me.  I am enjoying the

Subject: 944 sunroof problems


Well I worked out what was wrong with my sunroof, it sounds like your's may 
have the same problem.
The factory schematic does not show the details of the sunroof "relay" since 
it is an electronic controller. It is best not to try and test these guyes 
unless you are really sure of the connections. Depending in the internal 
circuitry it could easily be damaged.

The diagnostic procedure for the controller requires that you measure 
voltages on the sunroof switch on the console..
Pin 1 - battery voltage with ignition ON.
Pin 2 - battery voltage with key in "radio" position.
Pin 5 - battery voltage with central locking operated or speed of car > 1.8 
kph
(thats right! You should not be able to disengage while moving - I once had 
my roof disengage at speed)

On pre February '86 944s the pin #s are 2,3,4 respectively.

Anyway that wasn't my problem. The microswitches on the motor unit were 
loose. (the switches let the controller know the roof position). The screws 
had fallen out! Reinstalling the switches and checking alignment restored 
functionality. I am now happier and educated on 944 sunroof 
operation......If only life was as simple.

Subject: 944S:Novice service questions

Hello fellow Porschephiles,

I've just recently purchased an '87 944S that needs a bit of work (it's my
first Porsche :)  I hope some of you can offer some good advice, and you
are forewarned: these are novice questions.

1) Clutch: my friend with a Saleen Mustang (no flames, please) suggested
getting a dual-friction Centerforce clutch (Midway Industries). Does anyone
have any experience with these in Porsches? Also, is the most cost
effective method for replacing it to purchase the parts mail-order and then
have a mechanic install it? One mechanic I've spoken to refuses to do that,
saying that he couldn't guarantee the work.  But then again, I don't want
to get ripped off on the cost of parts.

2) Timing belt: I'm definitely replacing this, but should I also change the
pulleys while I'm at it? The car has 110K miles on it. And while I'm at it,
I guess the water pump should be changed, too.

Finally, if anyone in the Bay Area (Milpitas) can suggest a good mechanic
(and prices), it would be much appreciated. I hate to sound like a
penny-pincher with this kind of car, but unfortunately that's the situation
I'm in! ;)

There's another brown at least for the newer models.  I met a guy at the 
shop Thursday who had a brown 911, but it was BROWN, like a brown crayon 
would be.  My car is lighter color with kid of a champagne tinge to the 
color.   In the records I saw that some nicks had been touched up by a 
Porsche body shop in Ohio, so the color must be out there.

I'd be interested in this info too.  Part of what appealed to me about 
this car was that I had never seen a 911 this color before.

All 944 run sort of rough when cold.

BTW, if you're doing this "right" and have like a 12+ foot ceiling,
you should consider getting a lift from a local wholesaler dealing in
defunct garages/service stations/etc. Ours came via such a source.
Spectacular price, too. Just read the fine print and make sure you

<1. motor mounts
<Yes the Right MM goes bad often and leads to lots of
<vibs especially at idle.  change R every 25K and L every 50K (about)
<All 944 run sort of rough when cold.

I don't agree ! In the beginning, I changed MM:s twice on my -84.Since then,
I haven't changed any for more than 100 k miles.Maybe the spare parts have been
improved over the years? A failed MM is easy to spot visually, it looks
deflated and flat instead of a sort of triangular cross-section.
I've never had any problems with rough idle except for when the MM:s where bad.


<2. grinding in transaxle area
<I DO NOT think you should hear any grinding noises .. ever

Yes ! some 944:s have and others have less or no noise.This noise/vibration is
predominant at around 2000rpm during power on/off transitions.I inquired
to Porsche about it and the explanation was that this vibration/noise
originates at the clutch centre,gets transmitted down the transaxle and it's
actually the gearbox that makes the noise. Don't worry about this, I've had it
for 140 k miles (with the same clutch) !!

Don't forget that the pre-85.5 944 has a much less efficient fan and air

1) Bad Motor Mount: Replace both with 944 Turbo Mounts (there are only
two) to solve this problem.

2) Grinding noise behind seats in idle: Normal to hear a rattle.
Probably input shaft bearing play.

3) Squeal when turning: might be brakes.

4) A/C weak:  The 944 A/C should be able to freeze ice cream on a warm
day.  Check your sight glass for bubbles.  If so, add freon after
locating the leak(s).

5) Conversion to non-CFC refrigerant:  The BMWCCA mag, Roundel, just had
an article describing the procedure.  They say that the cost might be
between $200-$800 per car.  I would wait...

Are you sure that this car has a documented 17,800 miles, or just an

thing to do is change the timing belt to start your self-destructing

1) Clutch:  The most cost effective method of replacing the clutch is
by ordering the parts mailorder (Euroselect has a competitive price for
factory original) and replacing it yourself.  I did my 83 944 on my
back in my garage with a set of Craftsman 1/2" drive sockets and 4 good
jackstands and a good floor jack.  Cost was about $450 two years ago.

I have no opinion about the centerforce clutch, since I have not talked
to anyone with real life experience.

2) Timing Belt: If you don't do the work yourself, definitely have
everything changed while you are at it.  It will save the cost of doing
the same work over and over again, just to get at the parts that will
already be accessible or off the motor.

3) Milpitas Mechanic: Sorry I can't recommend anyone, even though I

Subject: RE: 86 944 turbo

My message re "click" was not well-written. The sound is more like 
"clunk" and it can be felt. It appears to be coming from right rear. Once 
the initial "clunk" has been heard and felt and you keep going, it is 
heard once more as you shift into second (much less noticeable) but that is 
the last time until you stop and start to move again. The it repears in 
first as you pull away and then again as you shift into second. It 
appears to me that in re-assembly after the clutch change something is 
not fitted properly and it takes one revolution forward to cause the two 
pieces to seat. And they again mis-seat until forward torque is applied. 
I haven't moved the steering wheel to turn just before the "clunk" is 
scheduled to appear, but I will try it to see what happents. Does this 
give you more of a clue? Thanks

Greetings Porschephiles,

In case you are not PCA members yet, I offer the following example of why you
should join. 

I was on a business trip to Toronto and as I was working my way towards
Immigration this voice behind me says "What kind of Porsche do you have?". I
said "944" and he said that he noticed my PCA patch and we started talking
about our regions' activities. I failed to get his name, but it just goes to
show that PCA people are some of the friendliest that you'll meet.

So, if you haven't joined PCA, I recommend that you look up the information
in Stan's monthly message and join. There's a whole lot of good people out
there and we tend to have fun.

P.S. Before we parted I told him to send a message to
porschephiles-request@tta.com for some of the best information to be had.
Should I have warned him about 356's racing on driveways and comments about
Tercels? :-)

Subject: 914 performance



I will be building an engine for my 914 over the next few months and I
would like some recommendations. I have built about a dozen VW type
I engines, with about half of them having performance modifications (i.e.
stroker cranks, cams, big bores, carbs,
etc) so I have an understanding of what can be done. However, never having
built a type 4, I have a number of questions regarding modifications to
this type. Specifically:
	1. What is the maximum rpm for a non-counterweighted 2.0L crank
before it starts to flex and damage the case?
	2. What camshaft would be appropriate for a street driven car with
occasional slalom/sprint runs?
	3. What other mods must be done to allow reliable higher rpm
operation? i.e. valve springs, pushrods, oil system.
	4. What cylinder head mods are recommended?
	5. What exhaust systems (I need heat exchangers) are recommended?
	6. Any other recommendations that are specific to the 914 engine.

I plan to use 2.0L rods/crank/pistons, 1.8L heads, and 45mm Dellorto carbs.
All information from people who have done similar projects is welcome. I
know the real way to correct the 914 power deficiency is by putting in a 6
cylinder but my budget precludes this at the moment!

Thanks,

In the interest of accuracy, perhaps someone can translate my paint code

because the previous owner advertised it that way.  Perhaps this is the 
"porsche" name fo the color.  But, perhaps not.  So to be certain 
here's what my my paint code sticker says:

	   rauchquarzmetallic
		  X5

My German's not just rusty, its non-existent.  But when I found this 
little label, it looked to me like "Rose quartz Metallic" (not Cognac 
brown).

Anyone out there have the color numbers to match up?  Any idea how many 
were made this color? Would love to know for sure.

Richard,

I buy parts through the mail or from the local Porsche dealer (Carlsen)
when they are having a sale and have my mechanic (DM Motors in Palo Alto)
put them in.  This saves about 50% on the cost of parts.  Right now 
Carlsen is selling EuroSelect for 20% above their cost which makes for
about the best prices I have ever seen on Porsche parts.  As far as the
timing belt goes I got a kit with both belts and all the rollers from 
Zims Autotechnick (sp?) in Texas for about $185 and had the mechanic
use whatever rollers he needed.  I saved the unused rollers for the future.

Here's mine :

I jack the rear of the car at the small flat spot just below the point where
the torsion bars exit the body of the car.  I put a square piece of 2x4 in 
the "cup" of my floor jack to distribute the load somewhat.  There is a 
"seam" in this area but I keep the jack just on the outside of this.  For
the front, I use a flat area of the floor pan near the front suspension
mounting points (I know realize this doesn't tell you much).  Some
owner's manuals show these lift points (I saw them once in an owner's
manual for a 911SC).  I have also jacked the car from the floor pan just
below and inboard of the factory jack tubes.  YMMV, but this has worked
for me.

I haa similar noise in my 944 that turned out to be a spinning pinion

About a year later my 951 had the same noise.  Noone could pinpoint it
until I finally needed the trans rebuilt.  Spinning pinion bearing
shell.

First they tried some miracle loc-tite and "buggering up" the case
where the bearing fits.  No use.  Eventually we had a slot ground in
the bearing shell (with a thin grinder) and had a steel pin inserted
into the case.  This worked for many many track events and is still in

The current issue (7/94?) of Car & Driver has a technical article on 
R12 and R134a, and the whole market and production issue.  Basically, 
there's plenty of it now but the US Gov't has forced reduced production 
of it.  Short supplies and high costs are on the way in the next few years.

Subject: Occasional hard starts



I have noticed that on occasion my 1980 911SC will turn over very slow
when starting as if the battery was on the brink.  This typically
occurs for a couple seconds, after which the engine turns over normally
and starts right up.  This can occur before a trip and after the car
has been driven and shut off momentarily.

Though the car has always started, I would like to be proactive in
identifying any potential problem.  Any suggestions?




Thanks,

My mechanic says the same thing - but based on metals (minerals, not 
hunks of iron) that are *not* added to the oil by Castrol.  Sounded 
pretty subjective, so I ignored it.  It's SAE rated with the best, and 
gets changed constantly anyway.  Then again, I've heard this from a 
couple sources, and it doesn't hurt to change.  Anyway, I use Mobil 1 
in the good cars and Castrol only in the winter beater.

BTW, oil pressure is a function of your car's oil pump, oil temp & base 
viscosity, filter, etc.  Judging oil brand via pressure gauge readings 
is pretty bogus, IMHO!  Kind of like a horoscope that says something 
like "you'll get a new job some day".

Subject: RE: 86 944 turbo

Hi Robin,
A "clunk", or lower-frequency metal sound, could be a few things in the 
right rear:

1) afore-mentioned CV joint.  Possibly worn - common cause of these 
symptoms, and often appears after being reassembled in a different 
position (internally) than before your clutch work.  Most noticable at 
low speed, due to torque of engine in 1st/2nd gear.  Might change in 
right vs. left turns.  Will get louder and more noticable through time.

2) Wheel bearing - unrelated to clutch job (unless they pulled the rear 
hubs ???!!).  Will get worse through short period of time, should be 
replaced asap.  Probably not this unless you have high miles or put 
lots of G force into the bearing often (i.e., track use).  Clunk is 
related to wheel speed & load & suspension angle (i.e., squat on acceleration).

3) Brake pad movement - but this isn't likely unless you're using 
non-OEM pads.  Did they replace rear pads when they did your clutch?  
In any event, you wouldn't feel this clunk, so I really doubt this is 
the problem.

4) Major suspension problem, like things falling off the car or broken. 
 Possibly rear sway bar not connected - most noticable under cornering 
and/or hard low-speed acceleration.

Hope this helps,

Subject: PAINT

$1000 MAACO paint jobs - I have tried the $500 paint job (actually $750 
with some prep work like taking off moldings and door jamb painting. I had 
serious overspray problems on the headlights, tires, exhaust system, 
mudguards, engine, etc. Assume that the car will be dipped in paint and do 
the prep/masking yourself. It was successful in that it made a $300 car 
look like a $1300 car. I received many compliments on it. The paint didn't 
start peeling until almost a year later.

Porsche vs. BMW vs. Q45 paint - I didn't think that these guys (car 
manufacturers made there own paint. Most good paint shop use Sikkens or 
Glasurit paint and have down draft spray booths. With Porsches, they claim 
that the toughest part of a partial respray is matching the orange peel 
(texture in paint - indicative of a so-so paint job.)

The factory paint is probably the most durable that will ever be on the 
car. A fresh paint job will stonechip very easily for several months.  A 
so-so paint job will make your car look worse and diminish it's value. Have 
you considered paintless dent removal and compounding as alternatives.

My $.02 - Cheap paint jobs are for beaters and race cars. I wouldn't let 
MAACO touch my Porsche unless I prepped it myself and tipped the guys who 
were working on my car before the work. If you get the car painted, 
consider color matching the Fuchs wheels. It is a real attractive custom 
touch.

Subject: re; Porsche paint

  re; Porsche paint

  1. Porsche did use BASF  "Glasurit" topcoats, I don't know if they still do.
      This was the top-dog of paints 10 years ago, you can get a truly
      spectacular finish with it and it weathers well. I don't know how it
      compares to other Urethane paints (I just used PPG Deltron and think
      it is good too, in fact probably dries a little faster which is 
      important in the dusty garage) but you won't be dissappointed with it.
       For primer coats, I'm a real believer in PPG Zinc-oxide/Epoxy primer
      DP-40/DP-90 series, the adhesion is excellent and also is the corrosion
      resistance. I still use Glasurit MS-295 primer/sealer before the 
      topcoats, I just like the way it sands, but DP-90 can be used straight
      from basecoat to sealer. Also there are 3 different colors in that  
      primer series, which works well when block-sanding.
       Do NOT use lacquer-type primers, they are obsolete and will not support
      a finish that lasts (they won't hold back moisture and they have NO
      strength of their own). Plus they WON'T hold on galvanized surfaces.
      I have used Dupont Vari-prime etching primer on aluminum/steel before,
      but the DP-90 sticks to anything, and Vari-prime will NOT hold back
      moisture.    
         Good paints are expensive, but worth the money.

    2. A friend had his 928 Maaco painted and it looked fine. Prep work means
       everything, though; and a good job doesn't rely on masking tape. Take
       off everything you can, meaning windshield squirters, door handles,
       all exterior trim, turn signals, etc. Especially for 911s with gaskets
       between each body panel, a lot of shops will just spray over everything
       which looks bad initially, but also will chip like crazy at every seam
       and wear worse. I think its just a joke when people, for instance, tape
       around the Hood badge or antenna base, when it takes a minute each to
       remove them altogether....
        Lastly, unless you are repairing collision damage, the front and rear 
       glass weatherstrip on a 911 probably is old enough to need replacement.
       Cut the outside lip of the rubber out with an exacto knife, then paint 
       with the glass in. This provides a seal to the inside of the car
       without having any kind of exposed paint-lip. 
        For the 928 all the trim (except for the door trim !) is easy to get
       off. The biggest pain on a 928 is the weatherstripping between the 
       nose and tailight panels, unless you remove the whole panel you do 
       have to rely on tape; don't use masking tape, instead use "trim" tape
       as it holds a better edge and can be bought in thin strips.

Subject: Re: 914 performance

Eric,

Start off with the archives. In most of '93, there is significant discussion
about how to do this...

> 	1. What is the maximum rpm for a non-counterweighted 2.0L crank
> before it starts to flex and damage the case?

Nominally, it's about 6k RPM, sustained. You can burst to more than that
from time to time, but not reliably. Problem is *NOT* the case per se, 
but the bearings. Once they start to go you put odd stresses on the
bearing saddles and it's all over...

You *CAN* align bore 914 cases, but bearings are a JUMBO pain in the
ass to find... As a result, you're best off tossing bad cases.

> 	2. What camshaft would be appropriate for a street driven car with
> occasional slalom/sprint runs?

FAT Performance makes the best cams for Type IVs. SCAT *used* to hold that
honor, but systematicly and consistently fails to honor their defective
parts, which seem to be occurring in much higher than acceptible numbers.
Consult with FAT for their assistance in picking the right cam for your
application. (they have FI and carb cams, in a variety of specs)

Avoid anything over 290 degrees of duration for the street, though.

> 	3. What other mods must be done to allow reliable higher rpm
> operation? i.e. valve springs, pushrods, oil system.

Define "high RPM". One of my (non-SCCA legal) racing 2.0s is a full-blown
miracle of high-RPM engineeringing -- counterweighted and knife-edged
crank, Carrillo rods, lightened tool-steel wrist pins, custom Arias
pistons, FAT *single* heavy-duty valve springs, carbon-fiber pushrods,
full dry-sump oiling system. This sucker pulls *HARD* to over 8500 RPM
on more-or-less stock EFI....

The minimum is *SINGLE* heavy duty valve springs (double springs are EVIL),
an Accusump and oil cooler with thermostat and fan. That's good for any
914 performance engine. If you want serious performance, get out the
check book and figure how much of the above you can afford. The trick 
for RPMs is to lighten everything, and reinforce everything else...

> 	4. What cylinder head mods are recommended?

Absolutely none. Except a good venturi valve job. The stock 2.0 heads are
just not to be beat. If you run 1.7 or 1.8 heads, there's a pile of
stuff you have to do to make them really work. The hot setup comes from
the land of E Production racing, where you section the head to relocate
the valves in the combustion chamber and change the angle of the airflow
from the intake to the valve, then re-weld the head together and flow
everything. It's tons easier to just get 2.0 heads if permitted by
your sanctioning authority.

> 	5. What exhaust systems (I need heat exchangers) are recommended?

There's only one choice then: get the SSI heat exchangers and a Bursch
exhaust. If you could do without the heat exchangers (and there *ARE*
tricks for getting heat into the car that involve either electric elements
or using the oil cooler), then the Kery Hunter system is probably the best
performance-wise, but not so good when it comes to passing inspections.
Eurorace makes one with that's a similar equal length header system but
with a Flowmaster instead of a Supertrapp...

> 	6. Any other recommendations that are specific to the 914 engine.

Tons. Some I give out for free. Some cost money. Gotta keep Ghost Racing
solvent somehow...

Ick! Ditch those 1.8 heads ASAP. That's the biggest power problem you'll
have. And I *DO* *NOT* *LIKE* carbs. They're such a giant step into the
past. You'll be lucky if it runs well at all for long. Especially in
the winter. And the "carbs make more power" thing is bullshit.

To all:

        I recently purchased a 78 911SC, I had the car in a body shop to be 
repainted, I went to pick it up Saturday after it being in the shop for a 
month.....On the way home, I got stuck in a traffic jam in the heat due to an 
accident on the freeway, My baby started smoking (white smoke), scared the hell 
out of me.....I pulled over to the side, turned off the car and sat for about 10
mins, after the traffic was flowing again, I tried starting the car up, No white
smoke (THANK GOD !!), so I thought it may have be just an overheating problem.

        Car didn't smoke for the rest of the time on the freeway, ( all down
hill, engine temp was pretty cool), when I got into town, it started smoking 
again....I got it home and parked it.

        Started up last night, more smoke... Found oil in the Air Box.

        Some background, I brought this car in April, it had been sitting for 
about 6 months, I drove it (ran great), was such a good deal I brought it right 
away (probably stupid in hind sight), drove it less the 100 miles, been in the 
body shop since middle May.

        After reading up on the Hayes manual last night, I found out there's a 
thermostat that controls when oil goes though the oil cooler, I suspect that the
weather hasn't been hot enough till yesterday for the oil to go though the oil 
cooler....Is it possible that there might be some kind of a leak around the oil 
cooler so oil is getting into the cylinders ? (I'm pretty sure the white smoke 
is due to the fact that I'm burning oil).  I still be good oil pressure and the 
engine seems to idle fine. 

      I'm about to get the car towed into a shop to get it checked out. 

Questions :

        Anyone ever seen this before ?, Could I be looking at a total engine 
rebuild ?

        Anyone know of any good shops in the Santa Cruz Area, there's R&D 
motors, but I've heard nasty things about them.  I'm thinking about getting the 
car towed from Santa Cruz to either Ken's Sportech or Carrea Tech (both in 
Campbell, so big $$$ for the tow), I've heard good things about both these 
shops. 

        Any help would be much appreciated.

Paul, sorry for the belated response, but I've been away from my computer for a

kidding about the difference in the size of these two cars.  However I'm not
sure whether there is that big a difference in the usable interior space in
these cars.  Because of the shape of the hatch, the 944 can carry a lot more
than you might think.  My mum has a 1989 928S4 and I have a 1983 944.  Mum's car
is considerably heavier, faster, and more comfortable.  However, the 944 is a
lot more nimble and "fun".

Yes, when you depress the accelerator, you will find that you hit a point of
added resistance.  If you push the accelerator beyond this point of resistance,
the engine will kick down to the next lower gear, assuming of course, that this
will not put it beyond the redline.  It takes about a second for this to occur.

I would think that there is either something wrong with the throttle adjustment,
or maybe you just didn't push the accelerator down far enough.  There is quite a
bit of resistance to overcome to get to the kick-down point.  Those would be the
first two things that I would check.  Hope this helps.

Subject: Clutch cables, jacks, brakes, and lubricants



Question: 
	Does anybody know of a 914 clutch cable which will last
when used with a 911S pressure plate ? The Terry cable, sold
by Tweeks as a "heavy duty aircraft quality cable", lasted about
a year in my car. Is there anything better ?

Answers / Opinions:

	Jacking:

		I use a 5 ton floor jack which has a closed height
or 5 1/5 inches. I drive the car up onto 1" X 12" boards and then
can just squeeze the jack in. Jacking points are: 
	Rear: jack up from the center of the motor mount. jack
stands then go under each trailing arm pivot point.
	Front: jack in the center of the front suspension cross
member (the big tube the steering rack bolts to). Stands go on the
ends of the cross member. This leaves the suspension and steering
free.

	Brake pads:

		I use Ferodo "M" or "AF" compounds for street or
auto-x use. They need to have some heat in them before they begin
to work well, require high pedal pressure, and dust heavily (especially
the "M") but have great feel and, once warmed, great bite. For
track  Ferodo "DS-11"s work great, but need to be real hot -- This
makes the worthless for street or auto-x use. I've heard several people
recently rave about kevlar "Power Pads" saying the are super sticky 
even when cold, but I haven't tried them. 

	Brake Fluid:

		Castrol LMA is the easy way. AP racing is the best,
but is extremely hygroscopic. The AP fluid has a dry boiling point
> 550C ! I use the Castrol LMA on the street.

	Oil:

		Castrol GTX: I used this on a TR-6 that I owned.
When fresh, it was fine, but after 600 miles or so it would start
to leak and burn oil. This repeated several times before I recognised
the pattern. A switch to Valvoline Racing solved the problem: no
leaks and no oil burning over the 3000 miles I went between changes.
A friend of mine who teaches auto shop and also restores old MGs
says that some cars HATE this oil and either burn it or leak it.
He is the one who convinced me to try Valvoline racing formula
and predicted it would solve my problems.
 
		Mobil 1: when I freshened the type 4 in my '74 914
(my current daily driver) I switched to Mobil 1 (after break-in)
the result was +3-5 HP on a chassis dyno, +easier starts and smoother
running in the morning. The negatives were some seepage at the pushrod
tube seals and incompatability with the oil pressure sending unit.
Which would leak only after the oil cooler thermostat opened.

		Valvoline Synthetic: Same advantages as with the
Mobil 1, but without the incompatibility problems with the pressure
sending unit and without the pushrod tube seepage. This is what
I am currently using. 

	Transmission Oil:

		NEO 0-wt Synthetic: This stuff is great ! + 3 HP
and no slow syncros when cold. Transmission feels, sounds, and works
better than ever. -- Hard to get and $15/qt.

Yes, this is exactly what I notice.  It's only apparent with the

I'd be surprised if stock pads & braking system had this symptom.  My 
brakes (86 951) actuate in nearly exactly the same spot with stock 
pads.  Only with the aftermarket pads does the actuation point move 
down, sometimes as much as 1 inch, maybe more.

Subject: Trail Braking

I didn't notice anyone tackling the request for the "trail braking"
info, so I'll give it a shot.  If I'm off base, feel free to blast me as I'm
just a weekend trail braker.  

Basically, a vehicle's tires are only capable of doing "X" amount of
work in the friction department.  For example, during heavy braking,
100% of the tire's capabilities may be called upon to slow the car.
If during this "heavy braking" you also attempted to turn the car, the
tires have no capability left to react the cornering forces.  When braking
for a turn, you can either do all of your braking in a straight line, and then
use the tires to react the cornering forces, or do *most* of your braking
in a straight line and ease off the brakes as you enter the turn allowing
the tires to simultaneously slow the car and negotiate the portion of
the turn prior to the apex.  As to the pros and cons of these two methods
(a little help here), I don't know.  I suspect trail braking would allow you
to postpone your braking for that extra split second.  I generally do most of 
my braking in a straight line.  Speaking from experience, under heavy 
braking, the rear of a 911 doesn't like to stay in the rear if you enter the 
turn at the braking limits of the tires (yes, I was able to *catch* it and 
not spin).

Hope this is reasonably correct and helps somewhat....

For $190 you get both belts, 2 smooth rollers for the timing belt,

The first thing I'd check is the ground strap that goes
from the fire wall to the transmission. It's partially 
obscured by the transmission mounting crossmember, but if
you get under there with a flashlight you can see it. It's
a braided copper strap.

The fire wall end of the strap usually gets corroded from
galvanic action and the trans end gets oily. The reason
it works sometimes is that when you put a lot of amperage
through the strap it arcs a tiny bit and makes better 
contact (momentarily) . If you take the strap off and clean
everything up really well, the problem will it will probably
go away. This is a Volkswagen legacy.

Subject: re: coolbrakes

I have this kit in my car.

I don't have very scientific data, as I haven't yet instrumented my 
brakes. I can tell you empirically that it did improve the cooling of 
my brakes somewhat in that for a while, I did not have to bleed the 
brakes after every track day.  If you occasionally boil your brakes, 
they should help. You should also use Cool Carbon or Pagid pads and 
Motul fluid as these will help a lot too. In fact, I think the pads 
helped more than the scoops (I used to use DS 11s and Castol LMA).

The scoops aren't very large, and being mounted low, they don't pick up 
very cool air. But they are easy to put on and improving on them 
usually means running hoses to a front air dam, and this is hard to do 
with all the suspension pieces in the way.

One downside is that they are pretty vulnerable, especially if you have 
lowered your car as many of us have. Things like car washes (brushless, 
of course), traffic cones (don't ask), and off track excursions (no 
personal experience here, thank God) can knock them loose or bend the 
scoops shut. They are pretty easy to zip-tie back on, but it is 
something to watch..

I'd be interested in what you learn, if others don't post to the alias.

figured bearings were bad in some of the rollers.  I got the Zims
kit and replaced all the rollers and both belts.  My engine STILL whines!
I could not figure out where the whine was coming from. I'm almost
positive it's balance belt related seeing as I didn't have this sound
until the belt was tightened.  Any ideas where this is coming from?
The only place left is the lower balance shaft. Could it be that?

P.S. - The older balance belt tensioner pulley was 24mm with a 17mm locknut.
       The new tensionser from Zims was larger (maybe 26mm), still with the
       17mm locknut.  24mm was the largest wrench I had so it was
       difficult to counterhold while tightening using pliers and a torque-

 Thanks for your input on coolbrakes.  I am already running cool carbons on the track

ran 2 days at Laguna Seca.  Before this event I did what I should have done
priviously, removed the backing plates from the rotors on all 4 corners.  This
combination made a big difference, I did not have to bleed the brakes at
all this weekend and had consistant feel all weekend.  Not to mention the
improved braking performance of the cool carbons...I could brake noticeablly
later with higher confidence.

 A friend at the same event with a 911 as well, with backing plates removed,
stock pads and Castrol LMA Dot4 was bleeding his brakes after every run and
still getting deterioriation in pedal feel during his 20 minutes.

So, I will probably try the coolbrakes for a margin of saftey.

Yea, I'm getting R*E*A*L close to getting my '66 912 back

1.  What size is the castelated nut on the rear axles??  33-36MM?
	The parts book just calls it a "castelated nut" and no 
	reference to its size.  I've got to take apart the
	emergency brakes - do I really have to take this
	bugger off??  The CVs are off, so leverage to get
	this torked nut loose wont be fun/easy.

2.  What grease should I use on the PLASTIC bushings I bought
	for the trailing arms?  Cant get rubber ones, so had
	to go w/plastic.  I want to avoid the inevitable squeak
	everyone on the net complains about w/plastic bushings.

3.  How do people successfully position their trailing arms to
	the appropriate settings?  Seems like the books I've looked
	at seem to indicate 36 degrees for 911s and 33 degrees
	for a 912.  The only thing I can think of is some kind
	of jurry-rigged protractor and level - the factory manual
	has a special tool, of course.  My car is on
	jack stands and isnt "level."  Any other experiences?

4.  Brake Bleeding:
	My lines/hoses are all new, calipers re-built, new m.cylinder,
	flushed fluid resevoir.......can you "gravity bleed" it?
	Say by keeping the brake pedal depressed and opening a
	rear caliper and letting it flow down?  Seems like I
	heard about this somewhere?  The "mightyvac" systems
	all look flimsy to me.  No, I dont have compressed air,
	so cant make a pressured bleeder system.

Trail braking means continuing to brake after turn-in, the brakes are
on too long, trailing into the turn.

The following is in the context of auto-xing or other high-performance,
near limit driving:

Generally, the pertinence to a 911 is that trail braking something to 
avoid.

With a 911, the safest driving technique is to do all your braking 
in a straight line, *then* turn-in with you foot *off* the brakes.

When you trail brake a 911 the rear wheels are unloaded to the point
where they loose traction and the car begins to oversteer.  

Oversteer a lot.

It's one way of getting the rear of the car around quickly.

I've used it auto-xing with mixed results; it's a dificult technique 
to really master.  It would be easier to learn if it were usable more
often - I just don't get that much opportunity to practice.

Potential application is a tight (90+ degrees) turn at the end of 
a straight.

You are trying to hold as much speed as long as possible.

You brake very late (intentionally or not ;-).

It's time to turn and you're still going too fast.

Continue braking as you begin to turn (don't forget that apex).

Rear end comes around and continues to scrub off speed (somewhere in
the turn you do take you foot off the brake).

Car has partially spun (you've done whatever to maintain control) and 
is now pointed in the correct direction.

You feed in throttle (somehow in all the confusion you've managed to 
downshift) and continue on the course.

There are other ways the technique can be of use; this is just one.

Hope this helps a bit.


- --Soren

p.s. if you really did mean trial braking, it's similar: that's where 
you brake too late and have to go to trial as a result.  -s.


p.p.s. if you ment trial breaking, that's where you threaten to brake 
too late and run over someone unless the retract their testimony.  -s.

I use WOOD, pressure treated variety, with galvanized nails.

They are easy to build, SOLID (they CAN'T collapse), CHEAP, last FOREVER
and sized just right.  My Dad's pair are 40+ years old; mine are "only" 10.  

Size 'em to whatever length/height you need for the car.  

The only disadvantage I've found is that they can be HEAVY.  You could
put a handle on the side to make carrying easier if it was important...


I know of two build methods:

  I prefer the "stack" build method, where the width of the ramp is the
  board width (ie, for 225 width tires, a 2"x8" is a bit narrower than the
  tire, so you might want to use a 2"x10").  You can make some of your
  cuts on a 45 angle to make driving up the ramps easier; you *can* plan
  the cuts so that you'll have *no* scrap.

  A friend prefers the "sandwich" method, where the max height of the ramp
  is the board width (the number of boards in the sandwich is the width).
  This needs better fasteners to hold everything together (lag bolts are
  recommended), but you can make any kind of ramp angle cut you want/need.

Subject: Colorado PCA Club Racing Report

The Porsche Club of America's Club Racing program made it's annual stop this
weekend at Second Creek Raceway outside of Denver.  PCA Club Racing is
patterned after vintage racing, in that fun is encouraged, car-to-car contact
is discouraged.  Most participants find the reward is the participation
itself, not finishing position or trophies (everyone gets the same trophy
anyway). 

Ellen and I drove down from Boulder (about 45 minutes away) around 2pm on
Friday.  We did the final suspension alignment, and ran the engine to see if
the leaking flywheel seal we replaced Thursday was fixed (it was).  The
paddock was already starting to fill up with PCA Club Racers from California,
Utah, Texas, New Mexico and Illinois.  Most unusual among the car trailers
was Mike and Jack Wilfley's horse trailer carrying their Black 356 Coupe. 
Also, Monte Smith's enclosed trailer was clearly marked "Mobile HIV Testing
Unit", that should keep the curious away from his highly modified RS America
stored inside. 

The 77 drivers registered were divided into 3 groups for practice, qualifying
and racing. Since Ellen and I drive the same car, (I drive with the B1 class,
and Ellen drives out of class just for fun), this format is really tough on
us and the car, we are much happier when there are four groups.  During
practice, we were often forced to skip sessions to perform normal maintenance
(change tires, check and bleed brakes, etc.). 

We were having a small problem with a mismatched float levels, but once that
was cured, the car was really running well.  We ran bias-ply slicks (Goodyear
R-600 compound) for most of practice, then switched to the radial slicks
(softer R-430 compound) for the practice races and Sunday's qualifying and
racing. We had an alignment that compromised for the bias tires (but was not
ideal for either bias or radial tires).  This was a good thing, because we
didn't have enough time to change it for the radials.  Given the time, I
would have dialed in more negative camber (which radial slicks really like!).


For Ellen's practice race on Saturday afternoon, she was gridded 6th
(outside, 3rd row), when the green flag dropped, she was in exactly the right
gear at the start of the torque curve, and just moved outside and passed the
two cars directly in front of her (as they say in NASCAR "like they was tied
to the wall")  She tucked in behind the pole sitter (Rookie Tom Linton in a
74 Carrera RS), and the two of them drove away from the field.  Within a lap
or two, Ellen passed for the lead, and held Tom off for the win. 

In my group (PCA classes A, B and C1) , the fast guys included Martin Snow
('72 911T, BIG tires, and 3.3L turbo engine), Tom Stephens (Norwood-modified
911), Ron Mistak ('74 914 Rocket Ship), Richard Raimist (Le Mans GT-2 3.8
RSR), Chick Misura (SCCA GT-2 914-6), David Ferguson (me) (SCCA GT-2 914-6). 
We had brief appearances by Bruce Dandrew who brought both a 911 RSR and a
914-6, both painted bright yellow, and Mike Zurick in a spotless Orange 911
RSR. I think Bruce left before qualifying, and Mike dropped out early in the
race.  Martin Snow, seen wearing a No Fear T-shirt that said "Losing is NOT
an option", took the pole with a blazing 1:09 (previous PCA record was a
1:11), I think Tom Stephens had a 1:11, and Mistak and Raimist were in the
1:12's.  I qualified 7th with a 1:14.8, just behind Chick Misura (1:14.0). 

The racing consisted of two 12-lap heats, where the finishing position during
the first heat established the grid position for the second 12-lap heat. 
Ellen's race was first. She had found some speed during the morning practice,
and turned a 1:16.8 during the qualifying session, but he best Timing and
Scoring recorded was a 1:18.3, so she started second to Tom Linton's 1:18.1. 
On the start, again the speed was just right, and she led as they entered
turn one, she laid down some great laps, and Tom flogged his car trying to
keep up.  After 8 laps she had about a 10 second lead.  Then a missed shift,
and a lapse in concentration, allowed Tom to pass with about 3 laps to go. 
She hung on for second, knowing that she would still get to start the second
heat from the front of the grid. 

My race immediately followed, and we barely had time to get the car to grid
before they gave the "fast five" signal.  Engine oil at 210 degrees,
transmission temp 225, tires 190+, let's go racing!  During the first heat, I
had a poor start, got trapped in the "wrong lane" during two-abreast corner
one, and finished 6th. 

Back to the paddock for a quick re-fuel and a brake bleeding.  When I pulled
in, the oil temp was 240 degrees, and the transmission temp was 280.  We were
still tightening the lug nuts when they gave the final call for Ellen's race.
 The car had cooled some, but was still mighty hot.  This time, Tom was
trying to get Ellen out of the torque band, since most race motors won't pull
until about 4000 or 5000 RPMs.  He led the field to the flag doing 20 MPH or
less. His mistake, since our motor is built for autocrossing, it will pull
pretty well from 2000 RPM up, and pull it did, as Ellen had about a three car
lengths lead going into turn one. This time she didn't drive away, but kept
the race interesting as she and Tom battled back and forth for the lead. 
Again, a missed shift (including killing the motor) cost her the race. 
Trouble finding third gear allowed the third place Carrera RS of Jerry
Schouten passed Ellen as well, but she poured on the speed and re-passed him
on the final lap. 

I had a better start in the second heat, getting ahead of Chick Misura on the
start.  I held him off for a few laps, but he pulled alongside as we exited
turn one when I had trouble finding a gear (I think we'll be working on that
shift-linkage!), we dragged down the straight, through the esses, and into
turn three,  I was still running right along side when we got to turn four
and he was able to pull in front.  I just settled into nice consistent laps
(no one was timing, but I suspect some of the laps were better than my
qualifying), and worked on finding a smoother line thorough the bumpy turn
three.  Near the end of the race, Chick spun off the outside of turn one
while trying to pass the 3.8 RSR, and I adopted second place, with Chick
rejoining about 10 seconds back.  I held on to finish second to Ron Mistak in
the B1 class, Chick finished third, and John Armstrong finished 4th.  At the
front the order was, Snow, Stephens, Mistak, Raimist.

From what I could gather of the other race, Jerrel Schouten (driving dad's
Carrera RS) pretty much set the pace, at had a surprisingly good race with
911 of Dan Rose, until he ran off the end of the track during the second heat
(I assume the brakes went away), and just headed for the pits.  Since his dad
would be racing the car in the next race, he knew handing it to him with no
brakes was not a good idea.  After Jerrel fell out, the very fast 356 of Mike
Wilfley took over the lead and lead a charging Pat Moyle and relentless Frank
Barrett.  I know that that porschephile Barney Bettilyon (Class I 914-6, "new
blue" #442) was having a good race with Colorado's Pat Colon in his Class H
914-6.

The workers choice awards (voted by the workers for the racers who best
exhibit the "spirit of PCA Club Racing") were presented to Martin Snow, Pat
Moyle, and novice Kathy Fricke (Class G 911, #33). 

Other notable incidents included the A2 car of Tom Stephens catching fire in
the hot pits, George Maybee exploding an engine during Ellen's race (it
produced a huge cloud of blue smoke as George coasted to a stop). 

Well if you're still reading, sorry this turned out so long.  I hope you

Are you sure it only has 17K miles?  If so, you are luckier than me.  I

have the new timing belt (that I had installed) adjusted, they had 
repair records
going *back* to 70K miles.  Fortunately, the original owner did have it 
properly
maintained...

There are only two motor mounts, unless you think of the torque tube as the
third.

The right one wears out sooner because of the exhaust manifold heat.  If your
car has only 17K miles, then I'd just replace the right one.  One the 
other hand...

Porsche has been continually upgrading the design of the 944/951 motor mounts
to solve their longevity problems.  Each new design supersedes the prior ones.
The current design is the best and is all that Porsche stocks.  There 
are two part
numbers on this motor mount which are (excerpting from a prior posting of
P C Schlesselmann):

944.375.042.05 & 951.375.042.04
There also may be a 951...05 number around as well.

Hope you get as much enjoyment out of your Porsche as I get from mine!

Subject: '87 924S 1st week report

Well, the pretty white porsche has been in the shop twice now. Once on
the 2nd day of ownership for a bad ac fan relay. The ac fan did not 
disengage and drained the battery. 

After a 70 mile freeway drive it leaked coolant. It didnt do this before.
Anyway, the dealership said it was the water pump. It needs a cam belt
anyway (21 000 original miles, but 7 years old). 

The seller thought his car was so perfect he agreed to pay for anything i 
might discover within a reasonable time. I basically maxed out his hospitality
with the water pump, but he is sending me $400+change. The original owner
was a Ford mechanic, but knew suprisingly little about the Porsche as far
as maintanence. Essentially he only changed the oil every 2.5K, and had a
bit of warranty service (oil pump, a motor mount, some unresolved vibration
complaints ). 

This may be the usual get-to-know-you BS, but the service manager said 
they hadnt seen a 924 with such a straight body in a long time. I suppose
thats a good sign. 

They also wanted to purge my brake system and fix a small oil seep (not
really a leak yet) around the cam. This was $500 more but I thought I could
wait on these items. The front pads are new and the back are fine. Any ideas
about these items. Two different Porsche mechanics have said the cam seep
is a pretty normal "leak" and that it can wait. I havent asked anyone about
the brake lines.

Also, how long should I expect my new water pump to last ? Is the water 
pump under constant load or is it temperature dependent ?

Thanks

Ed,

No simple answer to why different air flow/mass/volume senders are
used.  Most of the changes have to do with emissions and reliability.
They have nothing to do with performance.  The factory's current
911 3.8 RSR doesn't even use an air sender -- it uses only throttle
position and ambient air temp.

For Frank's '83 944:

>My question is, if the fans are

A quick peek at the '83 wiring diagrams shows that the cooling fan's
relay is powered by the X circuit.  That means it only gets power when
the ignition key switch is in the accessory or engine-running state,
but not when shut off.  So it would appear that the answer is no.

Exactly one of the beauties of Rzeppa CV joints: that they allow the

You will have to take it apart, clean it, then decide based on what you
see.  Chances are that if it's noisy because it's dry, the dryness has
itself caused enough wear that it's junk.

Subject: Re: 944 mavens, help!

Hunter,

I've seen a few answers given to your questions.  I'm only chiming up
because one respondant gave answers which were quirte wrong.

1. Motor mount: Get it taken care of right away.  As I think Jim Pasha
mentioned in the article you cite, if not attended to it can lead to
failure of the oil pick-up pipe in the crankcase.  Which gets real
expensive.

There are only two mounts, not three.  Whether to replace both while
you're in there, even if the other measures OK, is a toss-up.  If it's
a really old version, maybe not such a bad idea.

2. Faint grinding noise in neutral.  Perfectly normal, just input
shaft noise.

3. Squeal when turning.  Could be a lot of stuff, but it's usually a
loose power steering pump belt.

4. A/C.  I'm told that the A/C on pre-85-1/2 cars was pretty lame, but
I hate A/C and am no expert.  A friend blames it in no small part on
the ventilation system more than anything else.  Dunno.

Richard,

1. Clutch.  Your OE clutch is fine, and you cannot get a Centerforce
clutch for your car anyways, I believe.

Regarding buying parts and giving them to your mechanic, you will not
save any money.  He or she has to make a living, and part of that
comes from mark-up on parts as well as flat hourly rate.  That's
how shops survive -- that's how they pay mortgages on their homes,
put their kids through schools, and sometimes take a vacation.

A mechanic who says, sure, bring in your own parts, will make it up
on inflated time or other stuff.  Which means that you're either
dealing with a guy who's already being dishonest, or putting him in
the position of having to diddle the bill a little.

2. Timing belt.  You can check the pulleys and rollers when you have
them and the belt off.  If you can spin them and hear gratchy noise,
or there is play, then it's time to replace them.  However, this
procedure is really only an option if you already have the parts on
hand!  The safest thing to do, me being conservative, is realize you
won't be in there for another 30K, and go ahead and replace them.

You should also replace the balance shaft belt.  I'll bet you don't
have the tensioning tool, which is mandatory.  You ought to leave
the whole job to a shop, really.

Part one is a basic setup
Part two is the intermediate setup
Part three is the setup that one that only gods can afford!
(This setup is VERY nice--but perhaps not as nice as Stan's--perhaps 
others' too.)

The idea of this series is that one will grow into a larger shop as time 
passes. This is a summary of what they chose. I have included additions 
from what I could remember of the recent discussion.

Here goes:

Basic Shop:

One-car garage
workbench(with stools)
Much storage and shelving space
epoxy coating on the floor(they reccomend light gray for the color)

Safety Equipment:

Fire extinguisher
Fireproof container for combustible rags
Eye protection

Tools:

Small(three drawer) toolbox
Assortment of hand tools(buy the largest one that you can afford)
(MAC, Snap-on, Craftsman are good)
4-5hp air compressor
Drop light
3/8" variable-speed power drill
Soldering iron
Electrical pliers
Quality floor-jack
Quality jack stands
Air tools

Other Stuff:

Large trash can
Shop rags
Used oil container--dispose of properly at a reclamation center!!!
BIG container of hand cleaner(personally, I prefer Fast Orange)
Radio--music is your decision
Creeper

This concludes the Basic list. What follows is the intermediate setup 
that will add onto the basic list.

Intermediate setup:

Two-car garage
"Dirty" bench ( for dissasembly and cleaning.)
"Clean" bench ( for assembly and fine work--Carbs, FI, etc.)

Tools:

More hand tools(esp. a good set of pliers/Vice grips/clamps)
Tap & die set
engine diagnostic equipment: 
	Timing light
	Digital Multimeter
	Vaccuum & Pressure gauges
	12V probe (6V for you 356er's)
Bench-mount grinder fitted w/grinding wheel and wire brush
120V MIG welder(buy a 240V unit if you're able)
Larger(rolling) tool box
Engine stand
Cherry picker(remember, most cars in Hot Rod have engines that go out the 
top)
Engraver(modern-day branding iron!)

Other Stuff:

More shelves
Selection of your favorite fasteners(large as you can afford)
Wet/dry shop vac
mop w/ buckets
push-broom
Lift or pit, whatever you choose/is legal/etc.

This is the end of the intermediate shop. The shop of the gods follows--

Heaven--this is what Hot Rod calls it too! Really!

Shop:
Three-car garage

Tools:
Engine scope
Blast cabinet
Parts washer
Drill Press
Any other really cool machine tools you can afford/have space for
Tire mounter
Tire Balancer
Vises
Hydraulic press
Adamstand(This is a brand-name---neat multi-purpose stand for those who 
don't build cars all the time---holds engines/trannys/etc..)
BIG welder
Oxy-Acetylene welder
Battery charger/starter(portable)
Air tools--impact wrench, wrench, drill, saw, paint gun, airbrush, etc.
Specialty stuff--tools, chemicals, etc. used only for special 
purposes(you'll probably buy these as you discover what you need.)

Other Stuff:

Fender covers
Hot & cold running water
Heater/A/C.


Cars to go in these shops would be cool too. These I leave up to you to 
choose.


Hope this is worth the bandwidth.

Subject: Apal speedster with 2.4 engine

Hi,

I had the possibility to testdrive an Apal Speedster last weekend. This is a 
GRP kit for the VW modified pan. The kit is stunningly close to the original 
Speedster.

The owner claimed the modified T1 engine to boost 150HP. After the test 
drive I told him I doubted this, last summer I got to drive a real '55 
Speedster with engine, brakes (and gearbox?) from a late SC. Slightly 
modified with an estimate of 10% increase in HP.

I remembered the REAL speedster to be both faster and with better 
roadholding than this 'mongrel'.

Any comment on 150HP 2.4l T1 engines? It is his estimate and I told him to 
DYNO it, at his cost if it was under 150HP, at my cost if it was over.

Will I loose my money?

cheers,
Trond

Mike,

You're real close!  In fact, for the reasons you describe, trail
braking induces a little oversteer which may be useful in getting the
car to turn in.  I don't use the technique much, if at all, although
I really think I ought to give it a try.  Check out Henry Watts'

This really sucks. It must be wrong 'use tax'?

Even in Norway, the land of $150K for the new 968, we only pay $200 to cover 
the use/road taxes. Transferring ownership is $150 for all vehicles 12 years 
or older. The parking violation seem to be about the same as the 'cheap

Subject: 944 turbo S questions


Hello Porschephiles;

I am looking at a low mileage (~32K) 1989 944 turbo from a local dealer.  The 
dealer is advertising the car as a 944 Turbo S, which I understand only about 
700 were made for the U.S market in 1989.  My questions are:

1.  What differences exist between the standard 944 Turbo and the Turbo S 
version?

2.  Without the original sticker, how can I tell this is really the Turbo S?  
Are there any identifying marks or option codes?

3.  A call to the dealer revealed that no records other than the warranty 
booklet are available.  What should I watch out for in this particular model?

Of course, if I make a purchase offer it will be subject to a prepurchase 
inspection from an independent mechanic.  Any information that porschephilers 
could pass on would be helpful.  This will be my first Porsche.  Please respond 
directly to me unless you feel your information would benefit the entire list.  
Thanks in advance.

This message is in response to the owner with a 911 that won't start when 
it's warm!

>>From: 	Stefan Reitshamer
>>Date: 	Thu, May 26, 1994 7:44 AM
>>Subject: 	RE: 911SC won't start when warm (sometimes)

Please pardon any redundant information that I might of included.

I too have a '80 SC that won't start when warm.  I just got back from vaction 
and decided to see if the earlier suggestions ( about 2 weeks ago ...replace 
the fuel pump check valve...) were correct.  .

So off to parts hunting I go.  This last Saturday, I called my nearest 
Porsche Dealer and asked if they have a Fuel Pump check valve in stock,  Yes, 
was the kind gentleman's response.  So yesterday (Sunday) I put my car on 
stands and proceed to gain access to my fuel pump.  Exerting a little bit to 
remove the skid plate, to my surprise, the check valve I purchased from the 
dealer looks like nothing that exist on my car! (I guess that's what I get 
for buying the part on a Saturday)  

Today (monday US time), I called a few more dealers and one was kind enough 
to fax me a Technical Bulletin (Number:80-02, Part Identifier 2067, Subject: 
Replacement Fuel Pump Check Valve.)  From this and further inquiries to my 
original dealer I gathered more information to solving my problem.  If you 
folks at home would like to try FIYS (Fix it your self) and this is a first 
time installation of a retro fit check valve then you will also require a new 
Cap nut which they sell serpartely since it has it's own part number.

The p/n for the check valve is '810 906 093'(incl. copper washer)
'N013 8182' copper gasket (2 required)
 and the cap nut is 'N011 0691'
<<also noted in this TB is the warning: Caution - Part numbers are for 
reference only.  Always check with your Parts Department for latest parts 
information>>  ;-) 


The following is information copied from the Technical Bulletin
Procedure documented in the TB:
Check valve, replacing
 - pinch suction hose to pump to prevent fuel spillage
 - remove existing discharge hose fitting together with copper washers
 - install new check valve using new washers as illustrated (sorry internet is 
only ascii otherwise I would include the fax image.  I could uuencode the 
graphics it but I'm on a mac and don't have the utils to do it.)
 - torque check valve and cap nut to 20 Nm (14 ft lbs)
 - remove clamping device used to pinch suction hose
 - start engine and check for leaks (really this should say 'and be, once 
again, a happy porsche owner')


New check valve may be installed as of:

911        -from VIN 911 920 0885 Coupe
           -from VIN 911 921 0893 Targa
           -from VIN 930 980 0351 Turbo

924,      \
           -> all 1979/1980 vehicles
924 Turbo /
928        - all 1978/1979 vehicles


... after all of this, I still have an inoperable porsche and I'm not sure 
that it will start when it is warm!  In my quest to find out how to install 
this checkvalve, I seeked my brothers help.  His suggestion was that it goes 
somewhere behind the fuel distributor. There are two smillar fittings on the 
back of the fuel distributor that look somewhat like the check valve.  To get 
a better look, he  suggest we take it apart!   WRONG IDEA!!!!!  ...broke a 
banjo fitting in the process and now I'm down for three days waiting for my 
special ordered fuel line to come in! 

Morale of this is: don't take your porsche to a Mitsubishi mechanic (yes 
that's where my brother works)

I would at least consider getting the OEM cam belt from Porsche. As of a
few years ago, the belt Zims sold for the 944S was made by Uniroyal. The
factory service updates insist that nothing but a Pirelli belt be used.
I agree that the factory could be playing all sorts of games, and the
Uniroyal belt could be just fine, but you are taking a several thousand
dollar gamble. By the way, also make sure the belt you get has the
xxxxxxx.02 part number (as of about 2 years ago- there could be another
supersession). The factory belt is (or was) about $100 more than the
aftermarket belt, but, as I mentioned, you are placing a large bet.

Note that all of this applies only to the 16 valve cars. I don't know
of a similar issue for the 8 valve folks.

Subject: Trail Braking

Actually, the theory is:
1. your tire can maintain only so much lateral force, so
2. you want to maximize the utilization of the available load. This is the same as staying on the edge of the fricyion circle.
3. if you're applying max brakes as you approach the turn, you would presumably spin if you merely turned in, i.e. exceed the limits of adhesion. to avoid this, you ease off the brakes as you turn in, balancing the car by LIGHTLY applying the gas.
4. depending on the ve-HICLE, you can kick out the rear by braking later, adjusting the car's attitude with the throttle. I've been told, that senna would be on and off the throttle so fast (in the turns) that his head would bob around, as he danced on 
the edge of the friction circle...
5. don't start out doing this! the best approach for us beginners, is to get all your braking done in a straight line, down shift, balance the car and GENLTLY ease back on the throttle as you enter the turn, so that by the time you're exiting the turn the
 gas is full on...

have fun.

Now that it is back together I have two problems.

     what type and where to get them from.

  2) My CIS system can't seem to idle well with the new cams.

Subject: Re: Fees

Yeah,
  It's another incidence of Calif. rip off to auto owners, not as bad as 
the smog scam, but still a crock.

When you buy a used car here, they sting you for tax depending on county 
(8.25% I think in my County)  So if a car is sold 10 times, the 
state/county gets 10 times tax on the car.

That gets thrown on my registration the first time I transfer ownership 
(pink slip) which is new to me.  Along with that is a yearly fee based on 
the original price of the car.  Here's where it doesn't make sense.  Both 
my Honda Prelude and BMW yearly fees were less than a friend's '78 911 SC 
annual price for registration, but these cars have significant lower 
selling price, but were a little newer.

The penalties are just rip off fees for not filing within 10 days or 
whatever.  Selling a car nets you another fee.  Having any outstanding 
parking tickets on the registration, regardless of which of the previous 
drivers got them, will add some more.  Sounds more like an English policy 
than US, ehh?

I'm pretty much in agreement here, however, I'm wondering if there may be 
times when I may find special deals that might be even much lower than 
my shop's wholesale price.  Also, if I find that say Repco brake pads 
last 4 times longer than the one's my shop normally carries, I want them, 
and my shop may not have a wholesale lead on them.

However, I agree that in the long run, a good shop will have good prices 
on the parts you need, and keep automotion cheap clone parts out of your car.

Ok.  Lots of folks have translated the "rauchquarzmetallic" to mean 
"smoke[d]or[y] quartz metallic."  Is this the official Porsche color 
(i.e. from the numbers)?  My wife suggested that perhaps because this 
color didn't translate well into English, but flows trippingly off the 
German tongue, that perhaps for cars sold in the U.S. they list the color 
as "Cognac Brown" for sales purposes.  In other words, could the seller 
havve been correct and that the two colors are indeed different names for 
the same paint depending on the country in which you live?

The car is NOT the "chocolate" brown others have discussed, but more like 
a copperish or taupe sort of metallic paint.  I would like to respond to 
the paint color survey, but at this point I remain . . .

    One thing that Stan does not mention:
If you *do* ditch the 1.8L heads, you will need to find the 2.0L heads
(not cheap), and get a 2.0L-style exhaust (also not cheap).  You mention
needing heat exchangers already, so one assumes that getting a new muf-
fler is also no problem for you.  You may also need things like the
engine tin.
    Carbs don't mean more power, but they are cheaper to modify than
the FI systems, at least for most of us mortals....   ;-)    Means that
you don't have to use "expensive tricks" to keep the air metering good
up above 4000 RPM (f'rinstance) on the 1.8L flapper box.
    Oh, oh, rambling again--time to shut up.

     My 1980 928's auto transmission (3 speed based on MB 450SL
transmission) lost its reverse gear and won't shift up to 3rd when
kept full throttle after kickdown to 2nd.  I assume the upshift is
a matter of adjustment, but for the reverse gear, I'm worried that
a trannie repair place (any suggestions for Chicago?) will try and
sell me an entire rebuilt instead of just fixing the problem.
     Does anyone have any thoughts on what the problem with the
reverse gear might be, whether it should be repairable without a
replacement, and most importantly, how much I should expect to pay? 
Also, if I'm forced to replace the transmission, could I put the
later 4 speed auto in without (much) modification and would it be
advantageous?  I know converting to a manual is a hassle and
requires a new radiator.

remove your car from the rotor. This involves removing (in order) the wheeland t
ire, the caliper (don't let it hang by that hose-tie it to the spring), and the
hub and rotor. Then remove the backing plate. re-attach car, and voila!

Removing the plate allows more air to cool the rotor, and presumably more debris

<1.  What differences exist between the standard 944 Turbo and the Turbo S

Turbo S had 247hp vs 217hp for the regular 944 Turbo.  I thought I read a

BOTH during 1989, the final year.

Turbo S had the M030 suspension, which included adjustable Konis from the

than Phone dials, such as the flat dish.

FWIW, I haven't seen a Turbo S without cloth seats.

Subject: Re: Backing plates removal

There are sheet circular plates that mount to the struts/swing arms behind the
rotors.  They are there to keep stones and other road stuff from hitting the
back of the rotors and potentially scratching of nicking them.  
They impede the airflow to the rotors from the back side.
For normal street driving, you just don't get the rotors hot enough for this
airflow limitation to be a problem.  But on the track, the extra airflow to
the rear of the rotors makes a noticeable difference in the cooling of the rotor
and therefore less heat gets transferred thru the pads/calipers and into the
brake fluid.

If you have coolbrakes on your car, you removed your backing plates to install
them (so I believe).

If you take off any of your wheels, you will see this sheet metal plate directly
behind the rotor.

To remove them, you need to remove the rotors and then 3 small screws hold the
plates on.  You cannot access the screws without removing the rotors.

To remove the rotors, you have to remove the calipers, which means removing the
brake lines at the back of the caliper.

So, here is what you do.

Remove wheels (after jacking up)

Put some newspaper on the floor under the rotor

Remove brake pads.

Get a proper length piece of 2x4 and wedge it between the drivers seat and the
brake pedal so the pedal is driven to the floor.  With the pedal depressed, the
brake resevoir will no drain thru the open brake lines when you take them off.

Undo nut holding the brake line to the caliper, do not try to bend metal brake
line away from caliper, just slide nut back on metal line.

Unbolt the 2 large bolts behind the caliper holding it to the strut/swingarm
and remove the caliper.  Place it with brake line hole up, out of the way and
cover with some paper towel, so you don't get any loose junk in the brake
fluid.

Remove rotor

  On the front, that means taking off the dustcap, removing the nut and
sliding the hub and bearing assy off the axle....in the rear, remove the
two screws on the face of the rotor between the lug nuts and pull off
rotor (make sure you did not set your emergency brake).

You will then see the three(?) hex head bolts that hold the backing plates on.
Remove them and then the plates.  I replaced the bolts into the threaded holes
so if I decided you replace the plates for resale some day, the holes would be
clean and I would be  able to find the bolts.

Then put everything back reverse order....repack the front bearings and adjust
play.  

When you put the calipers back on, line the brake hose up with the caliper
as you line the caliper up with the mounting bolts.  I actually start the
brake line nut in a couple of turns before I put the mounting bolts in place.

Replace brake pads and then bleed the brakes...you should not get much air.

"S" has different features depending on year.  In 1989, the 944 Turbo S 
(951S) was renamed to 944 Turbo, and the "old" model was dropped.  The 
"S" has a larger turbocharger, 247 vs. 217 SAE bhp, strengthed 1st 
gear, xmission cooler (was option on 87+ turbo), great stereo, ABS, 
tighter chassis (bushings, etc.).  There's probably a couple other 
little things I've forgotten, but basically, it's faster and better 
than the base turbo.

> 2.  Without the original sticker, how can I tell this is really the

> Are there any identifying marks or option codes?
If the VIN or other documentation says it's a 1989, then it *is* an 
"S".  This is true of the U.S. model; Europe & ROW may have other 
designations.  If it's an '88 then it's [probably] rose quartz metallic 
with plaid comfort seats, and again, the special stereo and 247 hp 
engine.  There's probably a VIN series just for this model, but I don't 
have it in front of me - sorry!

Water pump leaks, cam belt maintenance (should've been changed around 
30-45K miles), worn or unmaintained CV joints.  Check the oil's 
cleanliness & odor (requires trained nose).  Look for coolant loss 
that's not visible (possible blown head gasket).  The rest of the car 
is pretty bullet-proof, unless it's seen much track time...

Hope this short bit helps!

In MA, we pay an excize tax, which is based on the percieved valuation
of the car when new. The valuation decreases year by year, as the car
value depreciates.  The pre-determined depreciation % is factored in 
and the tax is reduced .  A fixed rate per $1000 of value is then 
asessed.    

I believe CA, has a similar system but their "tax" is positioned as
a registration fee.

~ I didn't notice anyone tackling the request for the "trail braking"
~ info, so I'll give it a shot.  If I'm off base, feel free to blast me as I'm
~ just a weekend trail braker.  

You've got it about right; only a few pieces of additional information
that may make it even clearer, I hope (or at least more thorough):

~ Basically, a vehicle's tires are only capable of doing "X" amount of
~ work in the friction department.  For example, during heavy braking,
~ 100% of the tire's capabilities may be called upon to slow the car.

This is usually plotted on a graph called the "friction circle."  This
graph presumes that tires grip equally in all directions (which is nearly
true, although modern wide tires tend to have oval-shaped contact patches
that are wider than they are long).  Basically, the friction circle is
used to plot cornering force as a vector diametrically opposite to the
theoretical center of the curve that the car is describing (which may
or may not be the actual geometric center of the curve on the road).

Because the cornering force acts as a vector sum of forward and lateral
loads on the tire, it gets interesting.  Actual grip is roughly a circle
as mentioned above, but the way vector addition works is that 100% of
forward grip plus 100% of lateral grip equals a vector that totals, oh,
140% or so of total available grip *along that particular vector*.  
(Those of you with a compass and a ruler can check me out on this.)  This
is the mathematical explanation of why you can't brake and turn at the
same time.

How trailbraking is meant to work is that there is a time, during initial
turn-in for a corner, when you don't need 100% of either braking or
cornering force.  As you roll off the brakes, the linear vector drops
below 100% and frees up a fraction of the lateral vector, making it
possible to begin your turn.  Of course, about this time you may want
to start getting on the gas as well, meaning that the rear tires will
swing their vector around toward the rear of the car for acceleration
as well as lateral grip.  (And once again, vector addition works on
power as well as brakes, as anyone who watched the "Victory Circle" 
at the Monaco Supercup race will attest. :-)  In theory, anyway, you
can smoothly make the transition from braking to turning by doing
both -- below the limit of adhesion for either activity due to the
mechanics of vector addition -- and can therefore brake later into a
corner since you'll be carrying your actual braking zone longer into
the part during which you're turning.

Why this may be difficult in a 911 is due to its polar moment of
inertia and its rear-end heaviness.  Having the engine behind the
rear wheels helps in braking and accelerating in a straight line,
because the extra mass over the rear wheels helps provide traction
in both circumstances.  On acceleration, the engine provides down-
force to keep the tires planted; on braking, it resists the tendency
that the rear end has to rise up as the weight shifts forward under
braking.  Bear in mind that forward shift during the next part of
the discussion...

You see, when you turn, things get different.  The engine acts like a 
pendulum, or rather can become one if you're not careful.  Consider
hard braking for a corner: the nose of the car compresses, and even
though the engine is holding the rear down to some extent, the tires
in the rear are more lightly laden than they are when the car is at
rest or accelerating.  If you turn the wheel while the rear of the 
car is still lightly laden -- remembering that grip on a tire is
directly proportional to the downward force and inversely proportional
to its lateral load -- then suddenly you increase the lateral load
on the rear tires (reducing grip) while the tires also have the 
lightest possible downward force (reducing grip), all while the 
vector math says you're trying to exceed the friction circle.  At
such times, the primary consolation is the knowledge that hitting
something going backwards is probably the safest way to crash, as
the seat back spreads the load evenly...

Effectively, you reduce the theoretical circumference of the friction
circle at the rears -- that is, total available grip is reduced.  (That
is true for all cars to some extent, in that all cars transfer weight
forward when they brake; what makes it "special" in the 911 is the
presence of the engine in the rear, which adds to the lateral load on
the rear tires in ways that a front- or even mid-engined car does 
not.)  This means that anyone trail-braking a 911 needs to have 
tremendous sensitivity or deep pockets. :-)

It can be done, of course, and there are probably a number of list 
members who have learned it at PCA events.  In autocrossing in 
particular, it can be beneficial if you either have foresight and
restraint or lightning-like reflexes, as you can use the mass to
help "point" the car into a turn and then get on the power smoothly
but authoritatively to reverse the trend; it's possible to turn 
the car in less space than other vehicles might require, which
can translate to shorter lap times.

Fortunately, physics works in both directions.  As you press on the
gas, weight transfers to the rear, increasing available grip at the
rear tires and reducing the tendency to spin (assuming you haven't
already started sliding, of course).  In the days before trail-
braking was invented, this rearward weight transfer used to be one
of the main advantages of Porsches in handling; the high rear weight
bias meant that they could start accelerating earlier in the corners,
effectively lengthening the straightaway by a distance of several 
feet to several carlengths.  If you want to see how much that matters
in terms of overall performance, pay attention the next time you roll
up to a light at 20 mph just as it turns green, and see how far ahead
you are when you go through the next crosswalk.

Of course, the best location for the engine is actually in front 
of the rear wheels.  This position removes the pendulum effect to 
a tremendous degree, while still mitigating the tendency for rear-
end lift under braking.  It also reduces the inertia (technically
the polar moment) at the ends of the car, meaning that it's easier
to start the car turning and easier to stop.  914 owners may now
feel very smug. :-)

~  I generally do most of 
~ my braking in a straight line.  Speaking from experience, under heavy 
~ braking, the rear of a 911 doesn't like to stay in the rear if you enter the 
~ turn at the braking limits of the tires (yes, I was able to *catch* it and 
~ not spin).

And now you may have a few more details of why this is so, due to the
wonders of vector addition and weight transfer in a corner.  BTW, my
autocrossing mantra for the first year or so was "slow in, fast out;
fast in, slow out."  If you go into a corner a little slowly, you
can always apply power and storm out at high speed; but if you go in
too fast, you'll have to spend all your time trying to gather in the
car (or in extreme circumstances, making up excuses) and you'll almost
certainly come out of the corner far too slowly.  In the Sixties, 
race drivers used to say "In like a lamb and out like a lion."

Application of that mantra to non-automotive activities is left as an 
exercise for the student...

Subject: Free space saver tires

I have some brand new, never used, never inflated, Porsche space saver tires
to GIVE AWAY. I have absolutely no use for these, except for the rims that
came with them, but hate to throw out anything that somebody may find
useful.
 
These are Vredestein Space Master, 165-15, original equipment on Porsche. If
you need one, just let me know. It's yours free, except for shipping. And if
you can pick it up at my house, you won't even need to pay that.

For those who have been following this, here's the most recent.  I saw 
the previous owner today who showed me the sales contract from the 
Porsche dealer.  In the box for color it said:  COGNAC BROWN.  So, I 
guess the U.S. name for "rauchquarzmetallic" is "Cognac Brown."

Yes, they need our financial help.  Although I don't agree with all of their
views on seatbelt/helmet laws, they are about the only weapon we have of any
strength that is trying to get ridiculous speed limits changed.

I add my two cents because I recently found out that the NMA is about to
put a billboard up on the NYS thruway just west of Albany.  This billboard
will have an imposing image of a "uniformed tax collector" pointing a radar
gun at you with words to the affect of:

		    "Tired of this? -- Call 1(800) SPEED TRAP"

I drive by there several times a year when I visit my parents.  I can't 
wait to see it!  NY is a hold-out state.  55 mph on a highway designed
in the 60s for over 70 mph with 60s technology vehicles.

Anyway, if you want change in the speed limit laws and feel powerless,
$29 will be money well spent.  I'd like to see those billboards all
over the place!

Just for the record, the NMA was involved in getting the 55 mph national
limit repealed.

Nope, Kevin's real point is about what I'll call "practice management."
If you're trying to run a shop, you have to figure how to make a decent
margin so as to cover your direct costs, your overhead, and still make
a little money. For most of the smaller shops, it is a *LITTLE* money.

To do this, for any particular job there is a certain expectation that 
you'll take in a certain amount of money -- some from the flat rate hours
times your shop rate, some for parts, some for "shop supplies". Now
how do you really make money on that?

Well, some comes from the difference between the time in the flat rate
manual and the time you know it takes you do do a job, so you can effectly
do 20 hours worth of work in a 10 hour day. Some comes from the fact that
you're not paying your staff (if any) an hourly rate that's anywhere near
what you charge as shop rate. Some comes from the parts and margin you make
on them.

When you get to a small shop, there's typically not much margin around
by the time you cover all the overhead. So *ANYTHING* that reduces the
amount of money coming in on a particular job may make it not profitable
to do that job.  Elmer Fohey, my tame wrench, just won't do work if you
bring your own parts, or he charges wall-clock time instead of flat
rate -- and then takes his time on the job. It's just not worth it
otherwise.

I see this issue coming up all the time -- and have *VERY* pointed views
on it. It's *NOT* that you're "paying too much for the parts", rather its
that you're making it possible for that shop to *BE THERE*.  I view my
relationship with a shop as a business partnership. I'm trusting them to
turn the bolts, stock the parts, know the biz; I'm trusting them with 
"my baby"; sometimes I trust them with secrets and specialized knowledge
I have about tuning these suckers that they may not have. They trust me
do deal fairly with them, to pay on time and at the agreed rate, and to
tell them if there's something they can do better. 

I *NEVER* ask my business partners to operate at a loss, even "just this 
once". It destablizes them, eventually putting them under. And then where
am I? Left looking for another partner. Or, if I'm a dick and don't realize
that I've just done a bad thing, bad-mouthing them for all the things they
should have done (like give away *MORE* service) so I would have used them
more.

As I've said a zillion times before, saving money is great. Learning to
do things yourself is great. Asking any shop to lose money for the
privilege of having your business STUPID.

Have any of you removed your dash mounted headlight switch?  I am trying
to troubleshoot my problem of no headlights and I think I've traced the 
problem to the switch itself.  Now I cant remove the black plastic base
surrounding the switch.  There are 4 slots in it and I think my manual
states that you use tool P281 to remove it.  I can't believe that I 
have to buy a special tool just to remove this switch.  Any ideas.  I
don't want to ruin this plastic piece in the process of removing it.

I've removed backing plates from a number of cars (914s, 911s) and never
have had to disconnect the brake lines from the calipers.  As long as you
support the caliper properly so that it does not pull on the brake line you
can remove the backing plates and reassemble the rotor and caliper without
going through the process of bleeding the brakes (although you problably
should considering that you are probably removing the backing plates due to
overheated brakes).

I'd want the guy to know Porches (or at least 944s) like the back of MY

Subject: F355 vs 911

I guess this is a little out of place here but I would think we are
all fairly open minded and have a little interest in 911 competitors
(I know, no such thing). 

Anyhow has any one have any views of the new Ferrari F355 ?, I've just
see the first UK test, and it looks like a very interesting machine
for a bit more than 911 price (80,000UKP).

Here's a quick spec from memory, I forgot to bring the mag in to work
today:

 I think it goes something like 370HP for a naturally aspirated mid
engined V8 (107BHP per liter), five valves per cylinder with a first
for Ferrari of hydraulic tappits, to keep the formidable maintenance
down - interestingly enough one of the three inlet valves has a 10deg
lag to promote combustion chamber turbulence/mixing. Red line at
8500rpm(and I bet it doesn't sound all bad either), topping out at
185MPH. Err what else, oh yes it has a nifty low back pressure cat
exhaust system that works a bit like an electric turbo waste gate to
route gases though an additional cat at high flow rates.

Apart from the engine it also has a neat electronically adaptive shock
system (sensors for road speed/steering/pitch and a whole lot more),
that the testers thought were a whole level above anything they had
tried before. 

Visually - well I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it
sure isn't a dog.

I was thinking of a typical US gas station from app 1955-60, including a

Subject: '87 924S 1st week report

Well, the pretty white porsche has been in the shop twice now. Once on
the 2nd day of ownership for a bad ac fan relay. The ac fan did not 
disengage and drained the battery. 

After a 70 mile freeway drive it leaked coolant. It didnt do this before.
Anyway, the dealership said it was the water pump. It needs a cam belt
anyway (21 000 original miles, but 7 years old). 

The seller thought his car was so perfect he agreed to pay for anything i 
might discover within a reasonable time. I basically maxed out his hospitality
with the water pump, but he is sending me $400+change. The original owner
was a Ford mechanic, but knew suprisingly little about the Porsche as far
as maintanence. Essentially he only changed the oil every 2.5K, and had a
bit of warranty service (oil pump, a motor mount, some unresolved vibration
complaints ). 

This may be the usual get-to-know-you BS, but the service manager said 
they hadnt seen a 924 with such a straight body in a long time. I suppose
thats a good sign. 

They also wanted to purge my brake system and fix a small oil seep (not
really a leak yet) around the cam. This was $500 more but I thought I could
wait on these items. The front pads are new and the back are fine. Any ideas
about these items. Two different Porsche mechanics have said the cam seep
is a pretty normal "leak" and that it can wait. I havent asked anyone about
the brake lines.

Also, how long should I expect my new water pump to last ? Is the water 
pump under constant load or is it temperature dependent ?

Thanks

Subject: dmv reg fees for '77 911s

I have a question regarding my use fees for dmv due this month.  My line 
items are:

1. use tax      $578.00
2. odm/transfer   10.00
3. transfer pen   10.00 (it's late, I bought it last oct.)
4. use tax pen    58.00
5. park vio fee   30.00

They all make sense except for 1, unless it is including tax on my purchase
price of the used car.  I did send them a photocopy of my bill of sale, 
but since they didn't accept it (smog was > 6 months old), can they still 
use that bill of sale to base the tax on?

Thanks for any tips, I know I can't afford this on an annual basis.

I thought I might mention two unusual ones which I've found to work
well.  The first is Meguire's 39 heavy-duty vinyl cleaner.  It is
very good at getting the "fly spots" off of light-coloured vinyl, esp.
when worked with a small hand brush.

The second is Sonax car interior cleaner.  At the end of my tether,
I used it recently to take a nasty stain out of the carpetting, and
it worked.  The stain was oil or tar, gratis someone I let passenger
with me at Bridgehampton last summer.

Subject: Re: how much air? how much gas?

Ed,

No simple answer to why different air flow/mass/volume senders are
used.  Most of the changes have to do with emissions and reliability.
They have nothing to do with performance.  The factory's current
911 3.8 RSR doesn't even use an air sender -- it uses only throttle
position and ambient air temp.

For Frank's '83 944:

>My question is, if the fans are

>has come down?

A quick peek at the '83 wiring diagrams shows that the cooling fan's
relay is powered by the X circuit.  That means it only gets power when
the ignition key switch is in the accessory or engine-running state,
but not when shut off.  So it would appear that the answer is no.

Exactly one of the beauties of Rzeppa CV joints: that they allow the
suspension to travel in ways which slightly shorten/lengthen the
half-shaft length.  You're fine.

You will have to take it apart, clean it, then decide based on what you
see.  Chances are that if it's noisy because it's dry, the dryness has
itself caused enough wear that it's junk.

Hunter,

I've seen a few answers given to your questions.  I'm only chiming up
because one respondant gave answers which were quirte wrong.

1. Motor mount: Get it taken care of right away.  As I think Jim Pasha
mentioned in the article you cite, if not attended to it can lead to
failure of the oil pick-up pipe in the crankcase.  Which gets real
expensive.

There are only two mounts, not three.  Whether to replace both while
you're in there, even if the other measures OK, is a toss-up.  If it's
a really old version, maybe not such a bad idea.

2. Faint grinding noise in neutral.  Perfectly normal, just input
shaft noise.

3. Squeal when turning.  Could be a lot of stuff, but it's usually a
loose power steering pump belt.

4. A/C.  I'm told that the A/C on pre-85-1/2 cars was pretty lame, but
I hate A/C and am no expert.  A friend blames it in no small part on
the ventilation system more than anything else.  Dunno.

Richard,

1. Clutch.  Your OE clutch is fine, and you cannot get a Centerforce
clutch for your car anyways, I believe.

Regarding buying parts and giving them to your mechanic, you will not
save any money.  He or she has to make a living, and part of that
comes from mark-up on parts as well as flat hourly rate.  That's
how shops survive -- that's how they pay mortgages on their homes,
put their kids through schools, and sometimes take a vacation.

A mechanic who says, sure, bring in your own parts, will make it up
on inflated time or other stuff.  Which means that you're either
dealing with a guy who's already being dishonest, or putting him in
the position of having to diddle the bill a little.

2. Timing belt.  You can check the pulleys and rollers when you have
them and the belt off.  If you can spin them and hear gratchy noise,
or there is play, then it's time to replace them.  However, this
procedure is really only an option if you already have the parts on
hand!  The safest thing to do, me being conservative, is realize you
won't be in there for another 30K, and go ahead and replace them.

You should also replace the balance shaft belt.  I'll bet you don't
have the tensioning tool, which is mandatory.  You ought to leave
the whole job to a shop, really.

Subject: The Ultimate Garage(long)

Hello all p-files--

Here is the ultimate garage that I promised everyone as 
soon as I could find it in my much less than ultimate garage:
(The complete articles can be found in the Oct.,Nov.,and Dec. 1992 issues 
of Hot Rod Magazine). If anyone has additions, I can keep modifying the 
following list and repost it from time-to-time. I can also set it up on 
tta.com if Stan feels that this is useful to have around--let me know.

If anyone wants to reproduce this for PCA stuff, just email me @
claussen@rintintin.colorado.edu so that I can shoot the most recent 
revision to you--I can check for spelling, etc.. Otherwise feel free to 
do with it as you please. I only want money if YOU get some. :-}

Background:
Hot Rod broke this up into three parts:
Part one is a basic setup
Part two is the intermediate setup
Part three is the setup that one that only gods can afford!
(This setup is VERY nice--but perhaps not as nice as Stan's--perhaps 
others' too.)

The idea of this series is that one will grow into a larger shop as time 
passes. This is a summary of what they chose. I have included additions 
from what I could remember of the recent discussion.

Here goes:

Basic Shop:

One-car garage
workbench(with stools)
Much storage and shelving space
epoxy coating on the floor(they reccomend light gray for the color)

Safety Equipment:

Fire extinguisher
Fireproof container for combustible rags
Eye protection

Tools:

Small(three drawer) toolbox
Assortment of hand tools(buy the largest one that you can afford)
(MAC, Snap-on, Craftsman are good)
4-5hp air compressor
Drop light
3/8" variable-speed power drill
Soldering iron
Electrical pliers
Quality floor-jack
Quality jack stands
Air tools

Other Stuff:

Large trash can
Shop rags
Used oil container--dispose of properly at a reclamation center!!!
BIG container of hand cleaner(personally, I prefer Fast Orange)
Radio--music is your decision
Creeper

This concludes the Basic list. What follows is the intermediate setup 
that will add onto the basic list.

Intermediate setup:

Two-car garage
"Dirty" bench ( for dissasembly and cleaning.)
"Clean" bench ( for assembly and fine work--Carbs, FI, etc.)

Tools:

More hand tools(esp. a good set of pliers/Vice grips/clamps)
Tap & die set
engine diagnostic equipment: 
	Timing light
	Digital Multimeter
	Vaccuum & Pressure gauges
	12V probe (6V for you 356er's)
Bench-mount grinder fitted w/grinding wheel and wire brush
120V MIG welder(buy a 240V unit if you're able)
Larger(rolling) tool box
Engine stand
Cherry picker(remember, most cars in Hot Rod have engines that go out the 
top)
Engraver(modern-day branding iron!)

Other Stuff:

More shelves
Selection of your favorite fasteners(large as you can afford)
Wet/dry shop vac
mop w/ buckets
push-broom
Lift or pit, whatever you choose/is legal/etc.

This is the end of the intermediate shop. The shop of the gods follows--

Heaven--this is what Hot Rod calls it too! Really!

Shop:
Three-car garage

Tools:
Engine scope
Blast cabinet
Parts washer
Drill Press
Any other really cool machine tools you can afford/have space for
Tire mounter
Tire Balancer
Vises
Hydraulic press
Adamstand(This is a brand-name---neat multi-purpose stand for those who 
don't build cars all the time---holds engines/trannys/etc..)
BIG welder
Oxy-Acetylene welder
Battery charger/starter(portable)
Air tools--impact wrench, wrench, drill, saw, paint gun, airbrush, etc.
Specialty stuff--tools, chemicals, etc. used only for special 
purposes(you'll probably buy these as you discover what you need.)

Other Stuff:

Fender covers
Hot & cold running water
Heater/A/C.


Cars to go in these shops would be cool too. These I leave up to you to 
choose.


Hope this is worth the bandwidth.

Subject: Apal speedster with 2.4 engine

Hi,

I had the possibility to testdrive an Apal Speedster last weekend. This is a 
GRP kit for the VW modified pan. The kit is stunningly close to the original 
Speedster.

The owner claimed the modified T1 engine to boost 150HP. After the test 
drive I told him I doubted this, last summer I got to drive a real '55 
Speedster with engine, brakes (and gearbox?) from a late SC. Slightly 
modified with an estimate of 10% increase in HP.

I remembered the REAL speedster to be both faster and with better 
roadholding than this 'mongrel'.

Any comment on 150HP 2.4l T1 engines? It is his estimate and I told him to 
DYNO it, at his cost if it was under 150HP, at my cost if it was over.

Will I loose my money?

cheers,
Trond

Mike,

You're real close!  In fact, for the reasons you describe, trail
braking induces a little oversteer which may be useful in getting the
car to turn in.  I don't use the technique much, if at all, although
I really think I ought to give it a try.  Check out Henry Watts'

This really sucks. It must be wrong 'use tax'?

Even in Norway, the land of $150K for the new 968, we only pay $200 to cover 
the use/road taxes. Transferring ownership is $150 for all vehicles 12 years 
or older. The parking violation seem to be about the same as the 'cheap 
rate' over here.

Subject: 944 turbo S questions


Hello Porschephiles;

I am looking at a low mileage (~32K) 1989 944 turbo from a local dealer.  The 
dealer is advertising the car as a 944 Turbo S, which I understand only about 
700 were made for the U.S market in 1989.  My questions are:

1.  What differences exist between the standard 944 Turbo and the Turbo S 
version?

2.  Without the original sticker, how can I tell this is really the Turbo S?  
Are there any identifying marks or option codes?

3.  A call to the dealer revealed that no records other than the warranty 
booklet are available.  What should I watch out for in this particular model?

Of course, if I make a purchase offer it will be subject to a prepurchase 
inspection from an independent mechanic.  Any information that porschephilers 
could pass on would be helpful.  This will be my first Porsche.  Please respond 
directly to me unless you feel your information would benefit the entire list.  
Thanks in advance.

This message is in response to the owner with a 911 that won't start when 
it's warm!

>>From: 	Stefan Reitshamer
>>Date: 	Thu, May 26, 1994 7:44 AM
>>Subject: 	RE: 911SC won't start when warm (sometimes)

Please pardon any redundant information that I might of included.

I too have a '80 SC that won't start when warm.  I just got back from vaction 
and decided to see if the earlier suggestions ( about 2 weeks ago ...replace 
the fuel pump check valve...) were correct.  .

So off to parts hunting I go.  This last Saturday, I called my nearest 
Porsche Dealer and asked if they have a Fuel Pump check valve in stock,  Yes, 
was the kind gentleman's response.  So yesterday (Sunday) I put my car on 
stands and proceed to gain access to my fuel pump.  Exerting a little bit to 
remove the skid plate, to my surprise, the check valve I purchased from the 
dealer looks like nothing that exist on my car! (I guess that's what I get 
for buying the part on a Saturday)  

Today (monday US time), I called a few more dealers and one was kind enough 
to fax me a Technical Bulletin (Number:80-02, Part Identifier 2067, Subject: 
Replacement Fuel Pump Check Valve.)  From this and further inquiries to my 
original dealer I gathered more information to solving my problem.  If you 
folks at home would like to try FIYS (Fix it your self) and this is a first 
time installation of a retro fit check valve then you will also require a new 
Cap nut which they sell serpartely since it has it's own part number.

The p/n for the check valve is '810 906 093'(incl. copper washer)
'N013 8182' copper gasket (2 required)
 and the cap nut is 'N011 0691'
<<also noted in this TB is the warning: Caution - Part numbers are for 
reference only.  Always check with your Parts Department for latest parts 
information>>  ;-) 


The following is information copied from the Technical Bulletin
Procedure documented in the TB:
Check valve, replacing
 - pinch suction hose to pump to prevent fuel spillage
 - remove existing discharge hose fitting together with copper washers
 - install new check valve using new washers as illustrated (sorry internet is 
only ascii otherwise I would include the fax image.  I could uuencode the 
graphics it but I'm on a mac and don't have the utils to do it.)
 - torque check valve and cap nut to 20 Nm (14 ft lbs)
 - remove clamping device used to pinch suction hose
 - start engine and check for leaks (really this should say 'and be, once 
again, a happy porsche owner')


New check valve may be installed as of:

911        -from VIN 911 920 0885 Coupe
           -from VIN 911 921 0893 Targa
           -from VIN 930 980 0351 Turbo

924,      \
           -> all 1979/1980 vehicles
924 Turbo /
928        - all 1978/1979 vehicles


... after all of this, I still have an inoperable porsche and I'm not sure 
that it will start when it is warm!  In my quest to find out how to install 
this checkvalve, I seeked my brothers help.  His suggestion was that it goes 
somewhere behind the fuel distributor. There are two smillar fittings on the 
back of the fuel distributor that look somewhat like the check valve.  To get 
a better look, he  suggest we take it apart!   WRONG IDEA!!!!!  ...broke a 
banjo fitting in the process and now I'm down for three days waiting for my 
special ordered fuel line to come in! 

Morale of this is: don't take your porsche to a Mitsubishi mechanic (yes 
that's where my brother works)

I would at least consider getting the OEM cam belt from Porsche. As of a
few years ago, the belt Zims sold for the 944S was made by Uniroyal. The
factory service updates insist that nothing but a Pirelli belt be used.
I agree that the factory could be playing all sorts of games, and the
Uniroyal belt could be just fine, but you are taking a several thousand
dollar gamble. By the way, also make sure the belt you get has the
xxxxxxx.02 part number (as of about 2 years ago- there could be another
supersession). The factory belt is (or was) about $100 more than the
aftermarket belt, but, as I mentioned, you are placing a large bet.

Note that all of this applies only to the 16 valve cars. I don't know
of a similar issue for the 8 valve folks.

Subject: Trail Braking

Actually, the theory is:
1. your tire can maintain only so much lateral force, so
2. you want to maximize the utilization of the available load. This is the same as staying on the edge of the fricyion circle.
3. if you're applying max brakes as you approach the turn, you would presumably spin if you merely turned in, i.e. exceed the limits of adhesion. to avoid this, you ease off the brakes as you turn in, balancing the car by LIGHTLY applying the gas.
4. depending on the ve-HICLE, you can kick out the rear by braking later, adjusting the car's attitude with the throttle. I've been told, that senna would be on and off the throttle so fast (in the turns) that his head would bob around, as he danced on 
the edge of the friction circle...
5. don't start out doing this! the best approach for us beginners, is to get all your braking done in a straight line, down shift, balance the car and GENLTLY ease back on the throttle as you enter the turn, so that by the time you're exiting the turn the
 gas is full on...

have fun.

bought my '88 951"S". This was the first thing I did to the car, and
have been very pleased. A friend also bought a 951"S" about the same 
time. His was supposed to have had several engine mods....but mine 
after the chips was 2 car lengths ahead after 1/8 mile. I have also
been 165 mph and the car felt like it was still pulling.

Subject: 928 Valve Springs

I just recently finished putting my '79 928 back together. 
(I had a broken cam that needed to be replaced)
I decided since I had it apart, to change the stock cams for
something a little more aggressive.
Now that it is back together I have two problems.
  1) I should have guessed this problem would happen........
     .....valve float......suggestions on new valve springs?
     what type and where to get them from.

  2) My CIS system can't seem to idle well with the new cams.
     I have adjustable timing gears on my cams.....would it help
     if I advanced or retarded the cams?

Other than that the engine seems to run pretty strong.

Any help would be greatly appreciated....thanks.

About two months ago I became the second owner of an '89 944.  After 
following the messages on this conference, I'm concerned about finding a 
good, honest and affordable shop here in the Philadelphia area.  If 
anyone knows of such a place please write.

I had my previous car, BMW 318, serviced by a shop that specializes in 
German autos, primarily BMWs, but often there's a Mercedes or Porsche in 
the shop.  I was reasonably well satisfied with their work and I'm 
wondering how important is it for the mechanics to be schooled in 
Porches.

Subject: Re: Fees

Yeah,
  It's another incidence of Calif. rip off to auto owners, not as bad as 
the smog scam, but still a crock.

When you buy a used car here, they sting you for tax depending on county 
(8.25% I think in my County)  So if a car is sold 10 times, the 
state/county gets 10 times tax on the car.

That gets thrown on my registration the first time I transfer ownership 
(pink slip) which is new to me.  Along with that is a yearly fee based on 
the original price of the car.  Here's where it doesn't make sense.  Both 
my Honda Prelude and BMW yearly fees were less than a friend's '78 911 SC 
annual price for registration, but these cars have significant lower 
selling price, but were a little newer.

The penalties are just rip off fees for not filing within 10 days or 
whatever.  Selling a car nets you another fee.  Having any outstanding 
parking tickets on the registration, regardless of which of the previous 
drivers got them, will add some more.  Sounds more like an English policy 
than US, ehh?

I'm pretty much in agreement here, however, I'm wondering if there may be 
times when I may find special deals that might be even much lower than 
my shop's wholesale price.  Also, if I find that say Repco brake pads 
last 4 times longer than the one's my shop normally carries, I want them, 
and my shop may not have a wholesale lead on them.

However, I agree that in the long run, a good shop will have good prices 
on the parts you need, and keep automotion cheap clone parts out of your car.

Ok.  Lots of folks have translated the "rauchquarzmetallic" to mean 
"smoke[d]or[y] quartz metallic."  Is this the official Porsche color 
(i.e. from the numbers)?  My wife suggested that perhaps because this 
color didn't translate well into English, but flows trippingly off the 
German tongue, that perhaps for cars sold in the U.S. they list the color 
as "Cognac Brown" for sales purposes.  In other words, could the seller 
havve been correct and that the two colors are indeed different names for 
the same paint depending on the country in which you live?

The car is NOT the "chocolate" brown others have discussed, but more like 
a copperish or taupe sort of metallic paint.  I would like to respond to

    One thing that Stan does not mention:
If you *do* ditch the 1.8L heads, you will need to find the 2.0L heads
(not cheap), and get a 2.0L-style exhaust (also not cheap).  You mention
needing heat exchangers already, so one assumes that getting a new muf-
fler is also no problem for you.  You may also need things like the
engine tin.
    Carbs don't mean more power, but they are cheaper to modify than
the FI systems, at least for most of us mortals....   ;-)    Means that
you don't have to use "expensive tricks" to keep the air metering good
up above 4000 RPM (f'rinstance) on the 1.8L flapper box.
    Oh, oh, rambling again--time to shut up.

     My 1980 928's auto transmission (3 speed based on MB 450SL
transmission) lost its reverse gear and won't shift up to 3rd when
kept full throttle after kickdown to 2nd.  I assume the upshift is
a matter of adjustment, but for the reverse gear, I'm worried that
a trannie repair place (any suggestions for Chicago?) will try and
sell me an entire rebuilt instead of just fixing the problem.
     Does anyone have any thoughts on what the problem with the
reverse gear might be, whether it should be repairable without a
replacement, and most importantly, how much I should expect to pay? 
Also, if I'm forced to replace the transmission, could I put the
later 4 speed auto in without (much) modification and would it be
advantageous?  I know converting to a manual is a hassle and
requires a new radiator.

remove your car from the rotor. This involves removing (in order) the wheeland t

hub and rotor. Then remove the backing plate. re-attach car, and voila!

Removing the plate allows more air to cool the rotor, and presumably more debris

In reference to trail braking on a 911.......trail braking is typically
used to induce oversteer on cars that tend to understeer.  This is
NOT a problem on a 911.  I am usually starting to approach even throttle
as I am turning in and then to full throttle once I see I am lined up

Turbo S had 247hp vs 217hp for the regular 944 Turbo.  I thought I read a

BOTH during 1989, the final year.

Turbo S had the M030 suspension, which included adjustable Konis from the

FWIW, I haven't seen a Turbo S without cloth seats.

Subject: Re: Backing plates removal

There are sheet circular plates that mount to the struts/swing arms behind the
rotors.  They are there to keep stones and other road stuff from hitting the
back of the rotors and potentially scratching of nicking them.  
They impede the airflow to the rotors from the back side.
For normal street driving, you just don't get the rotors hot enough for this
airflow limitation to be a problem.  But on the track, the extra airflow to
the rear of the rotors makes a noticeable difference in the cooling of the rotor
and therefore less heat gets transferred thru the pads/calipers and into the
brake fluid.

If you have coolbrakes on your car, you removed your backing plates to install
them (so I believe).

If you take off any of your wheels, you will see this sheet metal plate directly
behind the rotor.

To remove them, you need to remove the rotors and then 3 small screws hold the
plates on.  You cannot access the screws without removing the rotors.

To remove the rotors, you have to remove the calipers, which means removing the
brake lines at the back of the caliper.

So, here is what you do.

Remove wheels (after jacking up)

Put some newspaper on the floor under the rotor

Remove brake pads.

Get a proper length piece of 2x4 and wedge it between the drivers seat and the
brake pedal so the pedal is driven to the floor.  With the pedal depressed, the
brake resevoir will no drain thru the open brake lines when you take them off.

Undo nut holding the brake line to the caliper, do not try to bend metal brake
line away from caliper, just slide nut back on metal line.

Unbolt the 2 large bolts behind the caliper holding it to the strut/swingarm
and remove the caliper.  Place it with brake line hole up, out of the way and
cover with some paper towel, so you don't get any loose junk in the brake
fluid.

Remove rotor

  On the front, that means taking off the dustcap, removing the nut and
sliding the hub and bearing assy off the axle....in the rear, remove the
two screws on the face of the rotor between the lug nuts and pull off
rotor (make sure you did not set your emergency brake).

You will then see the three(?) hex head bolts that hold the backing plates on.
Remove them and then the plates.  I replaced the bolts into the threaded holes
so if I decided you replace the plates for resale some day, the holes would be
clean and I would be  able to find the bolts.

Then put everything back reverse order....repack the front bearings and adjust
play.  

When you put the calipers back on, line the brake hose up with the caliper
as you line the caliper up with the mounting bolts.  I actually start the
brake line nut in a couple of turns before I put the mounting bolts in place.

Replace brake pads and then bleed the brakes...you should not get much air.

or if I missed the boat on my diagnosis.

on that price, so you get financially hosed :(  By not putting the date

"S" has different features depending on year.  In 1989, the 944 Turbo S 
(951S) was renamed to 944 Turbo, and the "old" model was dropped.  The 
"S" has a larger turbocharger, 247 vs. 217 SAE bhp, strengthed 1st 
gear, xmission cooler (was option on 87+ turbo), great stereo, ABS, 
tighter chassis (bushings, etc.).  There's probably a couple other 
little things I've forgotten, but basically, it's faster and better 
than the base turbo.

> 2.  Without the original sticker, how can I tell this is really the 
Turbo S?
> Are there any identifying marks or option codes?
If the VIN or other documentation says it's a 1989, then it *is* an 
"S".  This is true of the U.S. model; Europe & ROW may have other 
designations.  If it's an '88 then it's [probably] rose quartz metallic 
with plaid comfort seats, and again, the special stereo and 247 hp 
engine.  There's probably a VIN series just for this model, but I don't 
have it in front of me - sorry!

Water pump leaks, cam belt maintenance (should've been changed around 
30-45K miles), worn or unmaintained CV joints.  Check the oil's 
cleanliness & odor (requires trained nose).  Look for coolant loss 
that's not visible (possible blown head gasket).  The rest of the car 
is pretty bullet-proof, unless it's seen much track time...

Hope this short bit helps!

Well its official, I wrote the check last night to save this one from the

	Starts great
	idles fine
	will not spin above 3000 - 4000 RPM even standing still
	NO Power above 2500 RPM when moving.
I have checked:
	Vac. leaks, but I could have missed one, are there any places really

	Bad FI sensor
	Leak in EGR system???  (Crack in pipe at Cat. Conv) I have a 72

I do have the same problem from time to time. The heater gets stuck-on
even if the A/C is off and the thermostat is all the way down (blue position).
It eventualy goes away. The maximum time that was stuck-on was two days
last year. I am afraid that is some kind of short, that's why I never attempted
solving the problem. 
Any help will be also appreciated .....

Subject: 944 Oil Capacities?

Since I got my 944 three years ago I've used the local dealer to have it
serviced.  The previous owner (first) had only used to Mobil 1, so I've
continued this.  This summer I've been starting track events and am paying
closer attention to details.  I had the car serviced before storage in the
winter. This springe I went straight to my first tech inspection with the
December 10w30Mobil 1 still in it.  The car registered about 1+1/2 quarts
TOO much; well above the upper mark on the dip stick.  We drained the
extra out and got the level nicely in the middle.  I stopped by the dealer
and asked HOW, when I'd taken in only 6 quarts of Mobil 1 (they don't
sell it) and the capacity of the car is listed as 5.8 quarts, that
I'd be 1+1/2 qts over!  I was thinking that they'd neglected to change
the oil filter.  A really pessemistic friend suggested they just kept
the Mobil 1 and used their own oil, just putting in too much.  I thought
just asking them would prevent any odd things next time.
Well, again I took in 6 quarts of Mobil 1 (15w50) and got back a car which
reads well above the "normal" range; where the dip stick twists back:

       ----====|====|====------O
                         ^
I went back and asked.  The Porsche mechanic says (via the counter person),
"I usually put over 6 qts in 944s."  I ask if he put in more than the 6 qts
I brought in - answer, "NO."

I've subtly marked this oil filter and will check next time to see if
they're ripping me off on that.  Also, my plan next time is to have them
put 5 qts in and I'll check and add what's needed to bring it up to the
midline mark. But, what is the oil capacity of a 944? (I've checked and
there's no gas in the oil; that could have accounted for the apparently
higher volume of oil.)  How far above the "normal" range is normal, safe?

I've seen this extra expense (having the dealer do oil changes) as a way of
catering to my local dealer with only marginally greater costs to me. (See
the most recent REGIONFOCUS from PCA.)  But, if I'm getting ripped off and
sent tracking with a less than safe (overfilled?) car I'd like to know
about it.

Amen!  There are many cliches that became such because of the universal 
truth(s) they communicate.  Stan and others point out that there truly is
no free lunch, and if you wanna to play, you gotta pay.  It does cost more
to go first class, and we drive/love Porsche automobiles because they are 
first class in every respect, from the engineering that goes into them
to the materials specified for the components.  They are not perfect, but they 
*are* first class (Having owned and loved a '66 corvette with an M22 tranny, 
I'm *definitely Underwhelmed* by the 915 transmission, but that, to my eye,
is the exception that proves the rule...It's a cross I accept...)

When you try to *cheap charlie* a Porsche, you, in the long run, will be 
the sad loser.  This applies to the whole ball of wax, from the parts you 
put into your love, to the expertise and skill of the person putting those 
parts in.  that doesn't mean you shouldn't do much of your own work, but
be aware; the doctor who treats himself usually has a fool for a patient...

Ah well, those who this this is all BS have the excellent opportunity to test 
whether it's true that you learn best those lessons you pay the most for... :)

Subject: re: 944 heater problem


howdy,

If yu replaced the heater control valve (for H2O) and you still get heat
coming out check the following.

The climate control has out put leads to two electric over vacuum selenoid
valves.  Those valves are just behind dash, observable after removal
of the glove compartment, would be behind left side of the glove comp.

The system works like this..Normally the h2o valve is open (failsafe heat)
when the control calls for 'no heat' it activates a selenoid which allows
vacuum to the h2o valve.  
there is a second selenoid for the recirculate function -can see
flapers at air intake under hood cowl.

Check tht you are getting vacuum at the h2o valve, check vacuum 
supply to the selenoid valves, check voltage at the control
to the selenoids (12v for NO heat at appropriate valve)

differentiate valves by playing with heat & recirculate functions.

It is possible to wire a manual electric (or even vacuum hack)
to control the selenoid or the valve.  It is really
a waste of $300-$600 to get a new clim. contrl. when 
an hours work and a $2 switch may work.

any querries send a message.

Disconnecting brake lines on 911's


My 87 911 carrera, which matches the description in the factory manuals, has
a steel line from the caliper to the lower A arm.  This steel line is secured
at a number of points. Then it connects to  a flexible hose to the inside of 
the fender and a fitting to a steel line.  so, you can't bend the steel line away
and remove the caliper with the line connected.

On my Mercedes, a flexible hose goes from the inside of the fender to the caliper, and
so you can remove the caliper and hang the caliper from a hanger wire inside the fender,
out of the way while you remove the rotors.

Jay Ellis wrote that he was having problems with his heater staying on.

	I had a similar problem with my '83 944.  I don't know if your
climate control lever system is the same as mine but my problem was
that the lever that controls the temperature of the air was connected
to a cable, similar to a bicycle gear shift lever arrangement.  The 
problem was that the cable housing had broken free of the bracket on
the back of the pannel.  The lever still moved the cable back and forth
but the housing moved with it.  The first time it happened I was able
to clip the housing back onto the panel.  The second time I had to buy
a new pannel as the plastic mousting location had snapped.
	I hope that this makes sense and is of some help.

I don't view the Ferrari F355 as a Porsche competitor. It is far more

even close to being a "somewhat" practical car.

I don't think the people on the list mind talking about cars that
actually compete with the varous Porsche models on showroom floors, but
I suspect that we do not want to start talking about Bugattis, McLarens,
Vectors, and Ferraris in the "SuperCar" catergory. Porsche no longer

Should also have said that in the chase the spark plugs were changed (were

improved the running of the engine but little effect on HCs.

Isn't the seller obligated to record a sale price and date on the pink
slip/title stub that must be signed and submitted to the DMV at the
time of sale?

Frankly, I'm not going to falsify the price and date under penalty of
law, whatever that might be, to save the buyer some money on sales
tax and the recurring "use fee" (ie, the personal property tax).

How does a release of liability protect me?  I thought that just frees
me of responsibility from damages resulting from the use of the car
after the sale.  Does it protect me from other violations if I sign (or
appear to have signed) a falsified document?

(In my younger, rebellious days of the Vietnam era I had no problem
with this.  Damn...I must be getting old.)

Don,

When I first got my 1.8L 914 it also didn't accelerate very
well and didn't have much power.  You didn't specify whether
you have a 1.8 or a 2.0....

There were two problems with mine.  The big one was that the
Air Flow Meter was bad.  I think I remember the name right.  It
was sending _very_ confused signals to the brain box and things
weren't happening well.  The only problem it had I only discovered
recently.  One of the previous owners had connected the fuel 
pump into the system backwards!!  I think it is a testemant to
Porsche engineering that the thing ran at all that way.

I have all the articles I wrote when I was debugging the FI

Of course you are correct in that the steel brake line is attached to the
lower suspension in the rear and the strut in the front.  However, it is
quite simple to remove the clip that holds the brake line in place at these
points (also the location where the steel line connects to the flexible
line).  Although the brake line still passes through the hole in the
holding plate, the hole is large enough (the steel to flexible coupler fits
in the hole) that, in conjunction with the flexible line you now have
movement-access to, there is sufficient freedom of movement to move the
caliper a significant amount.  I have used this technique for years,
including 914s, 1978 911SC, 1993 911RS America, and 1995 911 Carrera (993).
 On the 993 I did this not to remove the backing plates, but to allow more
slack so as to swing the front strut out of the fender well to remove the
spring for measurement without having to remove the whole strut, bleed the
brakes, and realign the front suspension.

Subject: 77 911S Emissions

I have just rebuilt my 2.7 took it to my usual independent porsche shop
to have its set for emissions. It's CIS. The HCs at 1200 and would not budge.
They checked the timing, points, valve timing, leakdown test all OK. Then 
they found that by breaking the injector on number 1 loose (pressure drop to
injector) HCs down. Replaced the injector same, another injector still same.
Replaced fuel distributor head still the same. Used different port on dist head
still the same.

My reasoning goes; if its only cylinder 1 and this cylinder's leak down test the
same as the others (<5%) can be mechanical, can't be fuel distributor two give
same results, can't be injectors three give same results. What else is there ?
Injector fuel line to 1? Need to see if they checked this (but what could be 
wrong with a piece of pipe?).

CO has been adjustable all the time! Any ideas?

This problem has a porsche trained mechanic of 35 years scratching his head!
But then the last problem I took to him did the same (case spigots had been
over decked on 4,5 and 6) but the car had run for 3000 miles without problems
and just developed what sounded like a cam lobe problem. He wants to know when
I'm going to take him somthing he can fix.

Unlike the coolbrake kit where the hoses and scoops move with the

are not trashed by suspension movement.

Did someone change your oil while it was in the shop? You might check 
to see if it was overfilled (ise the dipstick). If it was, then it 
isn't uncommon for oil to "burp" up the breather tube into the airbox 
where it will burn and produce lots of oil smoke. This would happen 
more as the car warmed up and the oil expanded.

Here's hoping it's just that - it's a lot cheaper than most other 
causes of burning oil!

Subject: No Power,NO top end '75 914

Sorry, I should have been more specific, this is the 1.8L engine with the 
L-jet injection.  I did not have an opportunity to look at the timing 
scientifically, but I did loosen the clamp and advance the timing about 
10 degrees and the situation did  not change (except the car stopped 
idleing well).  I should get another serious crack at it in the next few 
days.  The previous owner is arranging transport so it should get to the 
house today or tomorrow.  BTW this is not exactly a prize auto.  The rust 
is minimal, and the interior is pretty good, but nobody has really cared 
for this car for a while and it shows a bit.  But hey it was cheap.  
I am trying to price out some aluminum hubs for this one so if anyone 
wants to unload some old ones that maybe don't look so good, keep me in mind.

Subject: Re: Trail braking

As others have pointed out, trail braking is a bit of an advanced 
technique, kinda like heel and toe. I think many instructors are loathe 
to mention it since they worry that novices will try it out and promptly spin!

There are two main reasons to trail brake:

1. To help turn the car. Most cars understeer or push in turns, and do 
so especially in low-speed, sharp turns. This is especially true of 
street cars as understeer is what is safest for untrained drivers and 
bad conditions...but it isn't very fast on the track. So experienced 
drivers will do most of their braking in a straight line before the 
turn (say, 95%), but continue to trail off the brakes as they turn in 
(doing another 5% braking on turn in), then move to power before the 
apex as normal. This trail braking helps compensate for push by keeping 
weight on the front tires, improving their grip and ability to turn the 
car, while lightening up on the rear tires, causes them to drift out 
more than normal. This leads to oversteer (also called in this case, 
"rotation") and faster turn in. You can probably guess why this is not 
a technique for novices - too much trail brake and you will rotate 
completely around! This is most often used in hairpin turns, like 11 at 
Sears point or 7 at Phoenix.

2. To carry more entry speed on a decreasing radius turn, or one where 
entry speed is much more important than exit speed. The technique here 
is to turn in and apex earlier than normal, and stay partially on the 
brakes during turn in to the apex. Turning and braking will slow the 
car as you turn and allow you to turn in more later in the corner while 
carrying more speed earlier into the corner. Turn 2 at Phoenix is this 
kind of corner - if you slow down enough to make the second (sharper) 
part of the turn, you are giving up time in the beginning.

As others have pointed out, your tires can do only so much. So if you 
are braking at the limits of traction and you try to turn, you will 
just slide (push). Similarly, if you are turning at the max and try to 
brake, you will slide, or more likely, spin. So trail braking is 
trading off some turning for braking. The benefits, especially for the 
unskilled driver, of trail braking aren't that great and the penalties 
can be pretty high, so it often isn't something routinely taught. It 
also isn't taught because in days of yore, no-one drive that way - the 
rule was "brake in a straight line, then turn in OFF the brakes." But 
it has been shown that trail braking is faster is some corners.

Anyways, my 2 cents...

Mike

PS. You advanced drivers out there - want to try something interesting? 
Try trail braking into a corner and then varying how abruptly you get 
OFF the brakes. The quicker you jump off the brakes, the more the car 
will rotate. I know it isn't intuitive and seems to contradict what I 
said above, but it is true...I wish I liked autocrossing, so I could 
use tricks like that!

Re: "I don't know how you tell if a guy's 'schooled' in Porches (sic). . .

Simple, just ask to see his PCNA training certificates. Not fool-proof, but
it's a good start. Plus, I would think most Porsche dealers use some kind of
"selection process" to help decide in whom they want to invest their
training dollars (it's not inexpensive for the dealer). At least, that's the
case at the dealership where my son works. I can do simple stuff on my 356B,
but leave the 951 to him.

The question for today:  On the 84 911 I just acquired, someone put the 
wiper arms on backwards (wince); i.e. they point toward the driver side 
of the windscreen instead of toward the passenger side when in the 
fully reclined position.

Question:  How do I take these off and reverse them?  I took off the 
outside nut for each, but nothing would move (and I didn't want to 
bend/brake anything not knowing what I was doing), so I couldn't get the 
things off.  What am I not doing?

Subject: Re: 912 start problem 



Greg, 

The only solenoid on the engine is the starter solenoid.  Given that
all you hear is a solenoid click and the starter motor doesn't turn,
it sounds like your problem has to be in either the starter solenoid
or the start motor (the coil's not the problem.)  Next time you get
that failure, try bypassing the starter solenoid with your jumper
cables.  If the starter motor turns, the solenoid is faulty; if it
doesn't turn, the starter motor is the culprit.

Item 2: Is your clock working?  The clock will place a small drain on
the battery when you have it in storage.  If you add that to the fact
that batteries loose their charge over time even if they're sitting on
the shelf with nothing attached that might explain your slow battery
drain.  It's been a long time since I've left my car in storage for
more than a couple of days so my memory on this is hazy, but I think I
can leave the car for about a month before I've got to put the charger
on the battery (the car's voltage regulator, generator, and battery
are all only about two or three years old and in very good shape.)

I hope this helps!

Fellow Porschephiles:


        Thanks to all for the responses regarding my smoking SC, as it turns 
out, oil over filling was part of the problem....but there is also a problem in
my fuel system (runs way too rich...) that's being worked on right now.

        It was reassuring to get the messages about the oil overfilling problem,
I was getting white hairs thinking I would have to have the engine rebuilt 
(Never knew Porsche ownership was so stressful !!!).

        I'll publish what happened when I find out from my mechcanic.

        Anyone know know of any good tech books for an 911 SC?, I have the
 Hayes manual and it's OK, but there are very few maintance tips and no trouble 
shooting tips.  Any books that are must read for a novice Porsche owner ? (All 
other cars I've owned, you fill the oil so it's around the MAX mark, you can 
also check oil when the engine's cool, how was I suppose to know to check oil 
with engine running and warmed up ??)....

Subject: HOT!!! 951 Brakes

Last weekend at the Denver PCA race, a friend of mine was having a serious
problem keeping his 951 ('89 944 Turbo) from running out of brakes. The
Denver track is notorious for being hard on brakes, but since he has had
zero problems at the two other tracks he has run on, he was quite surprised
and is wondering what others have done to overcome 951 hot brake problems.

Other than running MetalMaster pads and using Castrol LMA DOT 4 fluid he
has not done anything to the brake system.

While we're on the subject of hot, he was also having a hot engine problem
and was having to run his heater to keep from getting over 250 degrees.

Do any of you 951 owners who are tracking your car have any suggestions for
these two problems?

Subject: 356 coupe: cost of restoration


That time has come: sell the '64 coupe (in need of restoration) to pay the
daycare bills, or keep the coupe and someday I'll have the money for
restoration.

Even in it's state-of-need, I love that car -- it's been with me for 10
years, and I still dream of someday "touring" the backroads.  For now it
sits in the garage and waits.  This is a tough decision.  So, my question
to the porschephiles is: what's the cost to restore a coupe?

My question should probably be: what's the cost to refurbish the coupe?
The engine/transmission/body numbers don't match and I'm not interested in
concours.  I want a 356 that's solid, sharp looking, fun to drive and
reliable.

The body's OK, not great.  At least from the floorpan up.  The floorpan has
a hole (previous owner hit a rock?) under the driver's feet, and there are
gaps in the seams along the battery box.  The jack points are solid.  The
doors have a little bondo where they were creased in an accident (previous
owner, again).  It could probably use a new bonet (front hood).  The car
originally came from San Diego so there's no salt damage.

The engine's a January-ish 1960 Super (not a 90).  It starts after some
effort (there's a power drain somewhere).  It runs rough, partly because it
has a cross-threaded and incorrectly gapped #1 plug that I don't dare
remove for fear of not getting it back in, and partly because it has a
Weber kit that was probably poorly installed (the linkage is terrible).
The compression seems OK.  I'm sure I'd need to have it torn down, but
again, I'm not interested in the ultimate rebuild - just a strong and
reliable engine.

I'm soliciting rough guess-timates here.  I'm looking to the Porschephiles
list for guidance in deciding what to do with the car.  I haven't the
foggiest as to whether such a refurbishment is going to run around $6K or
$15K, and that difference makes a difference.

Thanks to all!

Subject: RE: 944 Turbo heater problem

Jay,
A water valve determines whether cockpit heat is enabled.  The valve is 
vacuum operated.  The vacuum is turned on/off by the HVAC control unit 
(probably through some sort of electric valve behind the dasboard).

Check if the water valve is operating: look betwen the engine & 
firewall, where some 1 inch (or so) rubber hoses are; you'll see the 
valve.  If it _is_ opening and closing (vacuum solenoid arm moves in 
and out) as you set the heater temp control to max / min, then your 
whole control system is OK and the problem is within the water valve 
itself.  New ones are around $30 US.

If the water valve doesn't move, then it's getting an incorrect signal. 
 This may be caused by a leaky vacuum line to the valve, a bad electric 
valve under the dashboard, or a bad control unit.  Since it sounds like 
you just replaced the control unit, I'd guess it's _not_ the culprit.

Working backwards from the water valve, check the vacuum hose (small 
hard plastic line) as it flows into the cockpit and into the dashboard 
area underneath.  Somewhere along the path back to the control unit you 
should find a problem.

Good luck, and stay cool!

Well, in case I'm wrong, it's not difficult to have the wipers

the wiper off the axle (the pliers I used is called "polygrip

I have thought about this as well. I, however, made a comparison with
motorcycles which never have any protection for the discs. My guess is
that's nothing to worry about. My backing plates will be removed next
winter.

P.S According to the Haynes manual a special backing plate could be ordered
from porsche which is designed for hard driving (vented?). Porsche Sweden tried
to order these plates from Germany but they where out of stock and production.

Well, Harvey and Linda Smith (who are arguably *THE* experts on this)

Well, it all depends... I bought my car needing no body repair and only
some paint touch-up, but with the engine in a box, the electricals hosed
up, and needing front end work in a big way.... Nine months later, I
had an Elmerized (tm) engine, and everything else was pretty much perfect
for a "daily driver" grade car (except one patch of surface rust I decided
it was too expensive to fix). The engine needed a crank, new rods, new
pistons and liners, and some welding repair on the heads, to help you
calibrate this. That's like close to $3k in parts right there... Anyway,
the net expenditure was close to $8k.

Shameless plug here:

Elmer Fohey gets $1100 per engine, plus any outside machine work, and
any "custom" work like powdercoating (which in Houston is like $80 for
all the sheet metal including fan shroud), and parts. That includes all
normal work, repainting all parts that need it, microcleaning everything, and
gen-u-ine factory trained labor behind it all... If you do two at once,
he'll give you a break on the 2nd one. And he'll work with you on parts --
I needed rocker arms, and we got used arms from Gary at RedLine, had him
weld up the tips with stainless welding rod, and reconture them for
about the cost of one new long rocker... Call or email me if you're
interested in details on Elmer's other engine rebuild services or racing
preparation.

Bottom line is this: if you keep it, you can fix it over time. If you
sell it, you'll likely have to come up with the scratch to replace it
all at once if you ever do so....

On the other hand, financial pressures are real. And it might be easier
to see the car go to a "good home" where it will be taken care of and
appreciated. Tough call. Good luck.

Subject: 912 Piston Failure



SUBJECT:  912 PISTON FAILURE

  

 

      Last week, the Maestro saw a failed 912 Piston. This is 

not unusual, since in his business he sees LOTS of failed 912 Pistons. 

Most usually follow the sequence: broken rings/broken ring lands/Ring 

Eating Monster/chunked Piston/Moon-like combustion chamber. 

 

     However, last week's 912 piston appeared to fail from having

had the Ring Gaps lined up over an Oil Return Hole!  

The Failure looked like this: 

 

      





            TOP RING GAP               (Pardon the Pseudographics)

                  \

         /----------- ----------/

        /___________ __________/

         



     Of course, the Maestro wrote a Story about this unusual failure 

and how he thinks it happened. But the Story is about 10K bytes long, 

and several on Porschephiles have expressed dismay at such a long posting, 

preferring short transmitals for instant gratification. However, if

enough people request the Full Story, the Maestro will be happy to post it. 

 

     In any event, HOW the failure occurred could be of great interest

to those who build their own engines, and for that reason, the Maestro is

asking for Technical Assistance in modeling the failure.  

 

    The Maestro started to calculate the Probability of the End Gap 

of both 912 compression rings aligning on top of an OIl Hole, and quickly 

realized that his 386 wasn't up to the task. He needs a Cray. Or a Pentium.

 

     So, Porschephiles, here is the Challenge: 

 

     Easy problem, you say, eh?  OK, then YOU solve it! 

 

     Here it is: A 912 piston has 2 top compression rings. Each ring 

has an "end gap" that can vary from .006" to .016" when new, to maybe 

a millimeter when old. 

 

    Below the second Compression Ring are 8 little oil return holes, 

sorta evenly spaced around the piston. 

 

    The Stock 912 Piston is 82.5mm in Diameter, and the

8 little oil return holes are 2.5mm (0.100") in Diameter, and arranged

around the circumference of the Piston, below the lower ring. 

 

 Part 1. What is the probability that the Ring Gaps of BOTH Compression
Rings

will Align on top of an Oil Return Hole if: 

 

    A. Both rings move at the same angular velocity? 

    B. Both rings move at different velocities? (Show velocity spectrum.) 

    C. One ring is stuck 

          1. over an oil hole 

          2. not over an oil hole 

 

    Part 2. With a ring gap of Oh, .010" to 1mm (worn rings), and both

rings aligned over the Oil Return Hole, estimate the Exhaust Gas Flow 

Rate through the opening, calculate the Heat Transfer Coefficients, 

Piston Temperature profile, and enlargement rate of the hole. 

 

    Part 3. Predict the Time and Mileage to Failure. 

 

    (Extra credit given for model which shows actual funnel-shaped erosion

pattern in piston.) 

 

    Use whatever computer facilities your employer may have available. 

 

    And: 

 

    KEEP THE 356/912  FAITH!!!

My '58 was rather rusty and needed a lot of replacements.

The body restoration has cost me $3k, and that is parts alone. I've bought 
tools for approx $500 that I of course will be able to use afterwards too :)
(I had the MIG/MAG welder from before...) 

Interior will be about $ 700-1000 depending how much I can tackle myself.

I've set aside $1500 for the engine, about $7-900 for a complete rebuilld 
set, and the rest for machining.

Well, that's about $5500, leaving $500 for the paint. Not much of a paint 
job, but you are going to do it yourself!

This would be a $6000 restoration. I'm going to use some more, but for your 
car it seem $6000 will be plenty.

But you have to do a lot of work yourself!(most) The upholstery could be 
nice to let a pro' do.

There is another possibility.  On mine the control valve would move but

A couple of things to look at:

   The centrifugal advance for the distributor.  Not sure exactly how that

garage, Automobile Atlanta, checked it out, and told me that there is a 
weight that is supposed to swing freely, but it had grease on it that
had frozen up over time.

  ANother time, it was a loose vacuum hose.  If those things aren't all

Barney,

As to running out of brakes in an '89 951, I'm impressed ;) as that car has
even bigger brakes than my '87 951. If he isn't using a Cool-Brake kit (ducts
for more air to the rotors) he should be. It will help a lot. Some people
also add wheel fans to further extract air from the rotor area. With good
cooling, brake fluid should not be an issue. There is an $80/liter Castrol
racing fluid, but I use ATE Super Blue Racing ($20/liter), which has a little
higher boiling point than Castrol LMA (plus it really is blue in color!).

Metalmasters are not racing pads; this needs fixing ASAP. I like Cool Carbon,
but there are many opinions on the best pad. Porsche uses Pagid for the
Supercup cars, and there are the old standby Ferodo DS11s (which need to be
warm to work). But not MetalMasters for racing! Proper break-in is critical
for new racing pads. I have personally seen accidents due to the failure to
observe this simple procedure.

I have never seen a 951 run hot. Something is wrong in the cooling system
(bad thermostat or perhaps just an improperly bled cooling system. It can be
a little tricky to get all the air out.)

Hope this helps,

I do my own oil and filter changes on my 1985/2 944 and I end up using 
exactly 5 litres to bring the oil level to the middle of the two marks on 
the dip stick.

Although the total oil capacity of the motor is somewhere around 6 litres, 
it seems that some of the oil is trapped and remains in the motor when the 
rest is drained out.

Another observation: I put my used oil into 4 litre containers, and I 
usually need to use 1 and 1/4 containers to hold my used oil.

I ran the Denver (Second Creek Raceway) PCA Club Race last year in my '89 
951 so have a little experience at this track . That weekend was bright sun 
and brutely hot so I'm sure the conditions your friend experienced this 
year were no worse. I did not have the brake problems your friend did (and 
since I did win my E stock class, I humbly submit it wasn't because I was 
slow.).
	
However, based on your message there are a number of things your friend can 
do to improve braking performance under race conditions.  Here's my recipe:
	* Remove backing plates
	* Install Bob Russo Cool Brake kit
	* Use Cool Carbon pads (Currently, I'm leaning towards the green 
compound, but that's mainly to                   have longer pad life.)
	* Use Motul 300 racing brake fluid bled before each event
	* Slot rotors
	* For each stoping zone use the brakes HARD but for a shorter time 
period
	* Get the car down to the minimum weight the rules allow

I hope this helps your friend (but not enough to beat me :-> ) Seriously, 
if your friend is doing any of the other PCA races this year, I hope he 
stops by.

Subject: 944S2 salvage

Hi everyone,
I'd like to ask for some advice regarding a 1989 944S2 for
sale in an Auto salvage yard.

I've just started looking for a 944S/S2/Turbo to buy and
set up as basically a track car for PCA Driver ed, autocross
& maybe club racing if I get good enough one day. I'm not
too bothered about cosmetic appearance and can do quite a bit
of my own work, hence I've been considering hi-milage cars,
cars from light impact accidents etc.

Anyways, I've found this car, its an '89 944S2, 58K miles, been
in a wreck, needs front bumper cover ass'y + lights, left fender, 
windshield, wishbone, bits & pieces, sounds like about $4K of
stuff (assuming mainly used parts), and they're asking around
$6.5K for the car. So far sound like a possible deal, but why is
it up for salvage?? - so I went to look at it...

Well what they didn't tell me was the car has been "grounded" hard
just aft of the front seats, i.e. ahead of the rear quarter panel -
the floor pan is pushed up right where the rear passengers feet would
be, the rocker panels are slightly bent at the point of impact, but
worst of all - the sunroof won't fit, its about 1/4" out of true, sideways
so to speak. Also there are two slight dimples in the roof at each side
of the sunroof, consistent with the car bending on impact.
So I assume the car is bent slightly. 

Well I'm basically put off the car by this, but I guess I'd like some
opinions on whether the car is hopelessly damaged - never get it straight
again, or wether this is the kind of thing a top class body shop can fix.
Obviously this is the real reason the car went for salvage. It's sad to see
it there, deteriorating, with that wonderful 3 liter 16 valve motor in it.
I'm obviously not considering paying anything close to $6.5K for it now.

If anyone can convince me there's a reasonable chance to save the car, I
may pay to flat-bed it down to Bodymotion and have them give a thorough
assessment.

Another question - if a car has a NJ salvage title, what are the implications?
will it always have a salvage title, no matter how well you repair it? is
it legal to sell it for road use?

Sorry for the long post, I'd really appreciate some words of wisdom,
Nick Craft.

Jerry,
	This was a "popular" modification in the "rain belt" a few years

	I don't remember all the particulars, but obviously it involves

	There is a gear, and a switch in the wiper motor gearbox that need

There are really four options:

0) factory gasoline heater. *HARD* to find. Adds signficant value to the
   car. Lets you cook meat in the passenger seat if you want to...

1) electric heat. Note that you *PROBABLY* have to use a bigger alternator
   than you have now for this one. It *ONLY* works because the 914 has such
   a small passenger compartment, BTW. 

2) oil cooler heat. In the VW world, there are people that make heater kits for
   using a remote oil cooler with a fan inside the car. You can adapt these for
   a 914-4 easily, and for a 914-6 with only slightly more difficulty. The
   trick is where to mount them. I've seen a few with big ugly holes cut in
   the rear wall of the passenger compartment, but the hot setup would seem
   to be mounting it where the factory gas heater would go...

3) fabricate 1 1/2" heat exchangers. A competent fab shop should be able to
   take a set of stock heat exchangers and give you a copy with 1 1/2" 
   tubes.

Lessee, prices.... the electric heat will be cheapest by a lot -- probably 
only cost $200 or so. The factory gas heater is like $750 if you can find
one, the oil heater takes lots of "plumbing" fabrication and then you hve
to integrate it into the rest of the car, the fabricated heat exchangers
would probably be $800 a set if you get lucky (and you'll then need a new
set every 5+ years since they won't be stainless....).

Good luck!

Subject: Easy on Those Brakes!

Hello All -

All the recent talk about brake mods is making me a little nervous.  I
realize that some of you track your cars *often* and need more brakes
than stock, and that almost all of you know what you're doing when you
mod things in the brake system.  BUT, allow me to play the wet blanket
and plead for a bit of discretion in all this.  The brakes are your #1
active safety system (well, maybe #2 after steering); if they go away
at speed you will probably be hurt... and uninvolved innocents may be
also.  The factory overdesigned your brakes by a BIG margin (I saw a
factor of 8 mentioned in a textbook once) because in the uncontrolled
environment of the street, you never know when some wierd 5-sigma event
will come along and make you GLAD for that extra strength, or protection
(e.g. backing plates), etc.

Again, I realize that most folks on this list know what tradeoffs
they're making when they second-guess the compromises that Weissach 
made to put Porsche performance on the street (and make it reliable for
250k miles).  Realize, though, that today's hot mod to get 5% more
performance may become an albatross 5 years from now, or to the next
not-so-avid owner of the car.  Or worse, it may come into fashion among
a ruder element of the hot-rod set, and appear on Baja Bugs and
Lowriders and Musclecars all over the country.  People who don't 
think that cracked brake rotors or kinked stainless brake lines can
happen to THEM...

So I say, hotrod your motors however you want; change the rollbar rates
and play with the suspension tuning, experiment with tires and
pressures.  Only change brake system parts if you REALLY NEED TO, and
only if you REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE doing.  The world will be a teeny
bit safer for it...

flames off,
Ed

A couple of things.  First, if you remove one end of the vacuum hoses
to the dist. advance unit and remove the cap, you can suck on the
hoses and watch to see that the vacuum unit is working (remember to
check the hoses for dirt and grease before placing them in your
mouth - yuk!).

I'm happy enough to not be familiar with the 1.8l injection system,
however, I do have an old Superbeetle with a similar injection system
that once had the same problem.  As it turned out with the Bug, 
VW had put a rubber or plastic plug in a hole in the flapper/barndoor
of the injection flow box.  The way the plug worked was that if there
was a backfire, the plug blows out - just like a popoff valve.  There
was just nothing plugging the whole after the plug blew out so the 
air passed through the hole without a proper metering.  Idled just 
fine and even gained some RPMs, but never had the top end.  The bad
part was that the plug was destroyed and there was no replacement.

Hope this helps some.

Well, I'm definitely a fool.  I have done all the work on my car to date.  For
three reasons primarily :  1.  I don't have any money, 2.  I don't have much
faith in the local shops (the nearest P-car dealer is about 1.5 hrs away)
and 3.  I enjoy it.

Relative to number 2, I learned quickly not to patronize some of the local
shops by witnessing what had been done to the car prior to my purchase.
Three different types of spark plugs in the engine at the same time, for
instance.  Another shop owner told me a leak down test was worthless -
"Why heck", he said, "I can tell more from just drivin' the car".  

Anyway, I'm no mechanic, but what I lack in knowledge - you guys fill in for
me :>))) -, I make up for in conscientiousness (is that a word?).  At least I 
know that what lubricants are used, that proper torques are followed, and what
the quality of the parts are, etc.

I think there is room here for moderation.  I don't advocate screwing the 
local repair shop, but I can't afford to pay premium prices for substandard
work.

Actually, this is the factory setup.  In the park position the 911 wipers
are on the drivers side.  In the USA the wipers park on the left side.
In Great Britain the wipers park on the right side.  So the factory
specifically chose this setup.

Moving the wiper arms at their shafts will NOT work.  Magnus Ottenstrom
has correctly pointed this out with his "will wipe the hood" statement.

Both of my cars (69T,72T) were changed to park the wipers on the passenger's
side.  The method is discussed in an old UPFIX'N article.  

I removed the wiper motor assembly, but maybe it could be done in the car.

Here is the UPFIX'N procedure and the additional procedure I used to test the
setup outside the car before reinstalling the wiper assembly.

It may not apply to the 84 year.

You can change the wiper park position by taking the wiper motor/assembly
out of the car, removing the wiper motor output shaft nut, pulling the drive
arm from the shaft, moving the drive arm 180 degrees on the drive shaft
and then re-installing it and the nut.

I checked the setting by powering the wiper motor/arm assembly with a car 
battery while it was outside the car. 

The 69/72 911 has a three speed wiper with these 5 terminals
  
    +12V fast
    +12V medium
    +12V slow
    +12V wiper parking cam supply
    Ground ("Earth" in other parts of the world) terminal on motor housing

To check that you have the re-installed the drive arm at the correct 180 
degree position, attach one wiper arm to the wiper arm assembly, 
attach +12V to the wiper parking cam supply terminal, - to the ground 
terminal on the motor housing, and then touch an additional 12V lead to one
of the fast/medium/slow terminals until the motor starts moving.  Then quickly 
remove the 12V you applied to the fast/medium/slow terminal and let the 
wiper park cam power the wiper to the park position. 

Be careful when powering the wipers to not grab the wiper assembly with
your hand.  Disconnect the Ground lead first.  The wiper assembly has 
moving parts that can pinch.

Don't ask how I know.

If the wiper drive arm was correctly installed the arm will stop at the lowest
position of travel.  If it doesn't, the drive arm isn't at the 180 degree
position and will have to be re-positioned and re-tested.

This procedure duplicates turning the wipers off in a normal fashion and
letting the wiper parking cam return the wipers to the park position.

If the drive arm is not at the correct 180 degree position, the wiper will
wipe to the bottom but park at a position up from the bottom.

The thin air at the Denver track altitude reduces cooling efficiency.  
All the usual problems are magnified.

Running Castrol LMA is not a good idea - it's a great street fluid but 
entirely inadequate for racing.  Have your friend switch to Motul, Ford 
Heavy Duty, or AP brake fluid, or any other high dry boiling point 
fluid.  Also add a Cool Brake kit if that hasn't been done already.

Lastly, if the pads themselves are a problem, switch to a carbon

with heat much, much better than other pads.

I called Automotion regarding this.  Yes, I think mine were painted but 
Automotion says Porsche painted them originally at the factory.  They come
without paint when you buy new replacements, usually grey.  So I guess I'll

Second, the reason I asked was that on the pre-purchase report, the mech 
noted "wiper arms on backwards."  Admittedly, I interpretted this to mean 
they were pointed in the wrong direction.  However, could it be what was 
meant was that the wiper arms were on the wrong side (reversed)?  On the 
current set up, the wiper arm on the driver's side has a small bend in 
it.  The arm on the passenger side is perfectly straight.  Perhaps they 
should be vice versa?  I'm befuddled.  *This mech is one which the local 
PCA'ers apparently use (I ran into a leader of the local PCA when I was 
picking up the car from the pre-purchase.)

Again, thanks for the overwhelming responses.  Sorry I didn't respond 
individually (too many!).

Subject: 914/6 conversion questions

Hello out there,

I was wondering what other 914/6 people have done with their rear axles and 
brakes when they use a 915 trans.  I know a guy who used 911 halfshafts but 
they are a little short - as he found out on the track when one side fell out 
of the CV joint as he was racing!

I have already converted my 914/4 to a 6, but now I'm upgrading everything.  
I had a 2.3L 911 engine with a 914 tranny, early 911 stub axles and 914/6 
rotors with stock 914/4 calipers on the rear.  The inner CV joints were 914/4 
(4 bolt) and the outers were VW bus (6 bolt).

I bought a 3.0 SC engine and 915 trans and just need to bolt them into the 
car and hook them up to the wheels!  Are custom length axles the way to go?  
Is it common/feasible to use 911 axles and use a "spacer" and longer CV joint 
bolts to move the CV joints closer to the axle?

Does someone make strong CV joints with the small bolt pattern of the early 
911?  Or do I have to get new stub axles and such?

What about brakes?  Since this will be a street car, DMV requires an 
emergency brake.

For the street, my current brake setup is pretty good since I have 911S 
brakes in the front and "working" 914/4 rear brakes (they do what they can!). 
I'm not racing the car (yet!) so I don't need 928S4 brakes at the moment.

Thanks,

     Allan

That's the entire problem!!!  He should run either Cool Carbon or Pagid 4-2
brake pads and a high temp brake fluid, which Castrol definitely is NOT!
 Good fluids to use are Motul, or what I use, Ford Heavy Duty.  And FLUSH the
brake fluid no earlier than 48 hrs. before the event.  I use AT LEAST two
cans of Ford fluid before each event.

Castrol and MetalMasters belong on the street, not in any track car.

Subject: 914/6 chassis stiffening kit

Hi all!

Has anybody out there embarked on the wonderful, fun-filled journey of 
stripping the rear of your 914 and spending countless hours bending and 
shaping the 10 pieces of sheet metal to weld in place?  Did you have fun?  
Did you give up and pay a shop to do the chore?  How long did it take?

How much did it improve the handling of your car?  Or does it just ensure 
that a 914/6 won't rip out its rear suspension under hard cornering?

I bought a kit but am now wondering if I should really install it.  I heard 
that if the welding isn't right, rust could set in and wreck everything.  
Living in Canada, I've got to think about this.  I want my car to last.

On another note, if any of you were wanting to "stiffen" your 914, or most 
any other unibody car, my friend's uncle (an expert welder) said that by 
"seam-welding" your car, you will make it much stiffer.  This means that you 
must weld a "seam" along every part of your car where two pieces of sheet 
metal were "sandwiched" together and spot welded every inch or so.  If you 
want to practise on your 914 before attempting the weld the critical areas, 
you could remove the front and rear trunk seals and weld the spot-welded 
metal there.  If your welds look ugly it doesn't matter since the seal will 
cover it up.  :-)

The question for today:  On the 84 911 I just acquired, someone put the  
wiper arms on backwards (wince); i.e. they point toward the driver side  
of the windscreen instead of toward the passenger side when in the  
fully reclined position. 
 
Question:  How do I take these off and reverse them?  I took off the  
outside nut for each, but nothing would move (and I didn't want to  
bend/brake anything not knowing what I was doing), so I couldn't get the  
things off.  What am I not doing?

I had a similar problem when I purchased my 356 . . . not backwards, but old 
corroded wiper arms that didn't seem to want to budge once the cap nut was 
removed. 
 
On the 356B, the inner "teeth" at the base of the wiper press fit on the drive 
shaft.  What finally worked for me was . . . a very careful splash of WD-40, 
wiggle and wait.  Eventually, the WD-40 made its way down to the drive shaft 
and the arms came right off! 
 
The key was to be gentle and patient. 
 
Hope this helps!

I was thinking of a typical US gas station from app 1955-60, including a

This may not be exactly what you're looking for, but here goes anyway . . . 
 
The best source I've found for miniature cars is EWA and Minature Cars USA  
Inc.   
 
Most of the vehicles they have to offer are models (as opposed to kits), but 
their catalogue is unbelievable!  In addition, they're a pleasure to deal with. 
In one case they searched their backstock for 30 minutes to find a model that 
I was trying to find to give as a gift . . . even though it wasn't listed in 
their catalogue.  (Yes, they found it.)  All that for a $20 model! 
 
My favorite is the 1/43 silver 1954 550 1500/RS Spyder #49 and it sells for 
$18, but there are a total of 14 other 1/43 550s in the catalogue and 4 of 
them are kits . . . including the famous Fletcher Aviation 550 Carrera 
PanAmerica Spyder! 
 
EWA can be reached at (800) EWA-4454.  Ask them to send you all their 
catalogues as there's more than one. 
 
Another source worth investigating is Exoto Tifosi.  They also specialize in 
models as opposed to kits, but there are three 1/43 550 Spiders in their 
catalogue for $16 each.  They can be reached at (800) 872-2088.  Try to get 
them to give you their ~80 page $5 catalogue.

Subject: Re: 944S2 salvage

~ Hi everyone,
~ I'd like to ask for some advice regarding a 1989 944S2 for
~ sale in an Auto salvage yard.

I've never done this specifically with Porsches, but I can only
imagine that the price differential for both parts and labor will
make this even LESS attractive than with most other cars.  I am,
however, coming from a background of a decade of fiddling with
hopelessly shot old sports cars of other varieties, my own and
those of my friends, and I've recognized a Basic Truth of the
Universe:

Every sports car has what I call its True Cost, which is roughly
what it would cost you to get the nicest one you can find. 

Every dollar below the True Cost that you save on the initial 
purchase -- thinking to buy a cheap one and fix it up for yourself --
translates to two or three dollars over the True Cost by the time
you actually get the car done.

I suspect that the price differential is actually greater for
Porsches than it is for the cars I'm used to dealing with (M.G.s,
Austin Healeys, Triumphs, Alfa Romeos, your basic garden variety
mass-produced sports cars).  To take a case study: the True Cost 
of an MGB is about $6000 today.  I just corresponded with someone
on CompuServe who is looking at a $3000 MGB.  This means, by my
reckoning, that if he buys this car, he will have to spend a total
of some $9000 to make the car as good as one he could buy for $6000
in the first place.

I haven't been following 944 prices in that year, but try my
rule of thumb as an estimate.  True, you can save some pennies
by not caring about the cosmetics, but this car has fairly
comprehensive structural damage if the *roof* is dimpled.

~ the floor pan is pushed up right where the rear passengers feet would
~ be, the rocker panels are slightly bent at the point of impact, but
~ worst of all - the sunroof won't fit, its about 1/4" out of true, sideways
~ so to speak. Also there are two slight dimples in the roof at each side
~ of the sunroof, consistent with the car bending on impact.
~ So I assume the car is bent slightly. 

This is what we in the restoration game call a "parts car," Nick.
If you had an earlier 944 with a blown motor and a trashed interior, 
you might come out ahead by buying this one, swapping out the good
parts into your car, and then paying to have someone recycle what
was left (or selling the unused bits).  That's if you could buy this
one for, oh, $3K or so, and had a place to put it while you took
things off and out of it, and had a truck to take it to the scrapyard
when you were left with nothing but the twisted skeleton.

If you want a wicked quick track car, consider buying a structurally
sound 924 for its tub, then swapping the bits from this one into it.
You can get unrusted 924s (out here in dry California, anyway) for 
less than $2000 if you really work at it.  I'd guess that a 924 with
that motor, transaxle, brakes and suspension bits would hum...

~ Well I'm basically put off the car by this, but I guess I'd like some
~ opinions on whether the car is hopelessly damaged - never get it straight
~ again, or wether this is the kind of thing a top class body shop can fix.

A top class body shop can fix it, almost certainly.  It's just that it
will probably cost as much as it would just to buy a decent car in the
first place.

~ Obviously this is the real reason the car went for salvage. It's sad to see
~ it there, deteriorating, with that wonderful 3 liter 16 valve motor in it.
~ I'm obviously not considering paying anything close to $6.5K for it now.

Hold that thought...

~ If anyone can convince me there's a reasonable chance to save the car, I
~ may pay to flat-bed it down to Bodymotion and have them give a thorough
~ assessment.

Consider that for track use, body trueness is even more important than
for street use.  Consider also the risk of metal fatigue from the 
original impact plus restraightening.  Consider thirdly what Porsche
body shops charge by the hour in your area.

I'd say you're looking at a $20,000 car by the time it works right.

~ Another question - if a car has a NJ salvage title, what are the implications?
~ will it always have a salvage title, no matter how well you repair it? is
~ it legal to sell it for road use?

That sounds like a state-to-state issue that I really can't address.
I'm not entirely sure even about California salvage law; I believe
you are required to inform a potential customer that a car you are
selling was recovered from salvage, but I am not sure.

~ Sorry for the long post, I'd really appreciate some words of wisdom,
~ Nick Craft.

The two wisest words I can give you in this circumstance are RUN AWAY.
Save your money and buy a straight, sound car to begin with.  You
*really* don't want to try threshold braking at 120 mph at the Glen
in a car with a 2" crab-track...

I wired in a switch that connects into the thermostatically

I've got two problems I've run into tearing down one of my 914

a number of times and am pretty sure I've got all the bolts/nuts
(I've checked three times).  I tried the block of wood on the
flanges method, but no luck (which cause the second problem to follow).
It appears that whoever rebuilt the motor used something resembling
adheasive to seal the case halves.  Any hints?

Now, for the second part.  While working on the flanges, I broke one.
It's the one at the front that sticks out from the oil filler mount
(the one right at the top in front).  I know that the cases can be
welded.  Is this type of damage a good candidate for a weld (assuming
that the rest of the case is within spec and I can get it apart)?

Some more inputs on the 356 restoration question(s)

Stan say:
>Well, Harvey and Linda Smith (who are arguably *THE* experts on this)
>say that a concours grade job is about $50k and takes about 20 months.

In my eyes/ears this shouldn't be necessary.None should need lay out that 
kind of money, even for a concours car rebuilld.This means they use 20 month 
or about 86 weeks? 86weeks * 40 hours * wages = xxxxx dollar???

Maybe they do *all* work themselves and still put $50k into a project?


The chassis restoring can cost a lot. Parts are pretty expensive, I got mine 
from my cousin's import co. at self-cost prices, I must correct the parts 
figure $3k to perhaps $5k to be more real.(If he should make a living on 
these...)

 In Germany you pay about $12k for a complete renovated as new chassis.(This 
may be on an exchange basis.)

Well, you do not need many connections to get an absolute top grade paint 
job for $2k if you can do some work yourself.(removing trim, interior etc) 

Stoddards has had the $4500 price for rebuillt warranteed 356 engines for a 
while now. That is *Complete* engines; muffler, heaters flappers, carbs etc.
I would never put more than this into any 1600cc pushrod engine!
If you do not need new engine, the Maestro among others can rebuilld your 
engine.

I guess you could use a lot of money restoring a 356, if you can afford *and 
justify* putting more money than a solid, authentic rebuillt car will cost 
you, it is all up to you. 

Roll up your sleeves and save $40k, not bad eh?

PS: Concours cars could of course be twice as expensive to restore, but I 
can't really get it. In my eyes the optimal 356 is as close as possible to 
how it was when it rolled off the line back in the 50-60's. *That's* 
concours to me!

What I've heard time and time again is "Consult your owner's manual" whenever 
it comes to the life-giving fluids of your vehicle.  Theoretically, Porsche 
should have a pretty good idea as to what type of oil works well in their 
well-engineered parts.

I've only heard of one area where synthetics may be "harmful" to your engine. 
This is when you rebuild the thing.  Apparently, some synthetics are superior 
to petroleum based oils in the friction department and this extra 
"slipperyness" may cause the rings and such to not break-in properly.  If you 
have 500 miles on the odometer, you may feel that you can rev the engine to 
your heart's content - but you may break it instead since it really hasn't 
broken-in properly.

Unless I'm running a multi-million dollar racing team where I might want to 
investigate this situation further, I'll stick to what Porsche says is good 
for my Porsche.

Hold on Scott, I think we have the wrong end of the stick here. IMHO
F355 is aimed as a direct competitor against Porsche. Hence my
original posting. Prices in the UK, in pounds at least are as
follows.

	911 Carrera	54K 
	928 GTS		73K

	F355		80K

	Before the new 911 which doesn't yet have many derivatives,
	we had:

	911 Turbo	72K
	911 RS3.8	91K (converted DM)

It seems to me that this car is perhaps the closest competitor to the
911 range in the current market (sorry NSX), as was the 246 back in
'72.

I agree with you here, it is of course very difficult to determine what 
restoration cost to expect without knowing the abilities of the restorer. If 
you do not have the possibility to do any restoring yourself, you could 
easily figure out $15-25k costs. If you, like me, want to do almost 
everything yourself, you will have a pretty original beautiful car for $10k 
or less excluding purchase price.

If you wanna pay more, nowone will stop you. But super nice 356 coupes seem 
to be around for about $25k. It should be an easy calculation.

Well, 914s are tricky bastads.... Joe Shemenski, who I know has taken
apart between 20 and 30 cases in the last three years alone and a whole
pile in the 10 years before that, *STILL* misses at least one bolt
(and *NOT* the same one) every time. So don't feel bad when I tell you
that you've probably missed at least one bolt.

My usual trick, once I'm sure I have all the bolts out, is to use a
block of wood and a lead-shot filled plastic mallet to gently tap
the case apart, usually at the flange on the top of the case near
the flywheel end, and the front of the case near the crankshaft
exit hole. There have been times where a *BIG* screwdriver helped, 
but you gotta be careful with that, mainly not to deform the mating
faces of the case.

Ooops. It depends. If you're too close to an oil galley, you're dicked.
Best thing to do is to split the case and send it out to someone
competent to make that call (my choices here would be H.G. Bieker or
RedLine, although FAT *can* do it) who  can also do the repair if needed.
If you can't get the case open, shoot, just send the whole thing...

Subject: RE: 944 w/ oil in coolant

Porsche redesigned the oil cooler for 1987 and screwed it up.  So, 
'87's that haven't been fixed commonly exhibit this problem.  The seals 
in the oil/water intercooler fail and the car exchanges internal fluids.

If caught early, you can just update the seals / oil cooler, and flush 
the oil & water systems *well*, and off you go.  If the water's been in 
the oil for awhile, you may have bearing damage and shortened engine life.

Another possibility is a blown head gasket.  Not nearly as likely, but 
still happens.  A compression check will not be conclusive here, 
however - you need to pull the head to see for sure.

  Even minor accidents can dimple the roofline. A car requiring localized
  frame work is not a real worry either (as long as you can find a shop who
  you trust). However, the sunroof twist is worrisome--check also door fits,
  look for any denting indicating a body stress far away from the collision
  point. A car with body twist isn't probably a risk worth saving unless
  its rare, and very few Porsches are....

   In Texas, its fully legal to fix and street a car with a salvage title.
  Here, you have to sign an affidavit attesting to the level of work done
  (usually "replaced front end" gets by). The title history will be forever
  a "salvage" car, though, the only way to expunge its history is probably
  to re-register in another state, though I've never tried that.

    As a hobby, partime fund raiser (my brother got thru law school fixing
  salvaged cars), and for our own personal cars we've bought probably 50+
  salvage cars; flood cars, rolled cars, one burn, usually just smashed. The  
  911 I had for 9 years was a flood car, the 928 we've had for 10 years was   
  smashed hard up front, etc. They can make good cars, but if your intention  
  is to ever put it back on the street there are easier and usually cheaper   
  ways to get a car. Usually by the time a salvage dealer gets the car, guys  
  who rebuild them for a living have passed on it as an economic proposal to  
  restore and  sell (and in my experience Porsches sell for way more than     
  they should at the insurance auctions, as guys who normally repair rather   
  boring cars get foggy brains wanting -that car-...). If you want a track    
  car, you can probably find a dead 944 waiting for that Motor for a lot      
  cheaper than trying to revive a dead chassis.
    Rebuildable cars go for about 1/2 what they're worth (not wrecked), and
  you'll typically have a restored car (if you do the work) for 2/3rds what
  they're worth....but the used Porsche buyer won't buy anything with a 
  history, so evaluate only on its worth to you or get ready to take a big
  loss.

  All 3.6/3.8L motors come from the factory with Shell synthetic.  Since
this oil is not available here in the states, it's been recommended to
me to use Valvoline 20W-50 Synthetic.  There appears to be less concensus
regarding the gearbox due to an apparent need for some friction for the
synchros to operate correctly, or so I've been told.  Many of the racers
in this area have switched to Torko (sp?) gear lubricant and seem to be
happy with the results.

Caveat: Some have complained about synthetics exacerbating leaking 

problems on  older motors.  I've stuck with 20W-50 dino oil in my 

'82 911 SC.

Subject: Going from 2nd to 1st ger at 5500RPM's


Very Important Information:  On a Porsche 911SC 3.0L engine, there is a direct 
ratio between each RPM turned, and $1.  That is, it costs $1 for every RPM
when shifting from 2nd to 1st at 5500 RPM's!

My day of saddness has arisen...

I believe that, last night, after acidentally going from 2nd gear to 1st at 
5500 RPM (when I meant to hit 3rd), I may have just smoked my valves in my 
1981 911SC 3.0 Liter engine.  The car now runs/idles much rougher than it 
did before I decided to race that Mustang.  :-(

One call to my mechanic confirmed my speculations.  He told me that the cost
is mostly labor to do a new valve job.  Parts are about $600, and It would run 
about $4400 total to do a valve job.  He usually recommends replacing the 
engine.  He said for about $5500, I can replace the 3.0 liter engine with a 
3.2 Liter Carrera engine.  He gets the old engine, the total cost would be
the $5500 for the new engine, installed.  I would end up with 25 more HP also.
What do you people think about this price?

He asked me if the car still ran, which it does, and said it would not hurt 
the engine or car any more than the damage already done if I continue to 
drive it.  It idles rough (shakes) and idles a little lower than it did before.
It Idles around 900 rpm now and shakes, and the idle fluctuates dipping down
to about 600 rpm's and then climbing to maybe 1000.  It used to idle smothly
at around 1100.  Also, it has much less power below 2000rpm now.  But it does
start and run.  Can you say Valve Job?

For $5500, he will swap the engine with the 3.2L.  I said "But I just paid
my tuition, I don't have that much cabage ($)".   So he told me if the car
is running, I should suffer through the summer with it, and take it easy
while driving.  Is there anything I should be wary of if I continue to run
the car in the current situation?

Also, I can kind of figure that fixing what I broke may be a complex task,
and this may be a stupid question, but it cannot hurt to ask...
Is this something I can do myself?  I am pretty mechanically inclined, but
I have never cracked open a car engine before.  How difficult is replacing
the valves and whatever else I may have broken.  I have the Haynes Manual.
Should I put the winter beater $100 chevette back on the raod, buy some
jack stands, and go for it?  My feeling is that I should just start saving 
and have it done professionally, but $4400/$5500 is alot of cash.  Should
I go for the new engine option, or just have the valve job done?

Are there a motherload of other things I may have F---ed up in that split
second of downshifting, when I should have upshifted?  (ie: could I have
bent other things besides the valves?)   Can anyone give me some advice in
my time of sorrow, as to what my options are?  Selling the car is out, I
just had major body work done (911 to 930 Turbo body conversion) and the
car looks brand new.  It has 50Kmiles on it, and I plan on keeping it for
years to come.

Am I alone in this world?  Has anyone else done this stupid mistake, or
am I the only bonehead to smoke the engine in a 911?  Please tell me that
others have done this.  Is there a "We blew our engines in our 911's" 
self-help group in the Boston area that anyone can reccomend for people that 
do this?  :-)  Advice on what I can do will be welcome, I feel like I'm at 
a funeral or something.

car is warm.  When I let up the clutch, the idle goes
back up.
    Speculation right now is that the clutch cable is
somehow wrapped around a fuel line.  (?)  Not at all
a good thing, if so, because friction will wear right
through.
    Anyone else have any ideas?

    Most places go by the year of the engine.  California says to
go by the later of the engine or the body.  Either way, for you,
it's '78.

Subject: restoration costs

I guess I'm even more laissez-faire than Trond on what the optimal 356 should
be.  I like the idea of using some of what we know now to make the car "better"
than it was in the year of its birth.  That's why I stay away from 356's and
67 VW dualcab pickups: the preservationists wouldn't like what I would do to
them, and there aren't enough good ones to spare.

Article in latest Excellence shows extremes that concoursers will go to.  Why
aren't these people sending my son to college?  Clearly the last few concours
points cost (tens of?) thousands of dollars apiece; how many do you need before
you can call it a restoration, rather than just a repair?

Interesting that Trond can get excellent paint for $2000.  Hate to think what
one's wife would have to do to get that in the US.

I have to agree with Mike here on all 3 points, but especially #2.
I recently went to a local shop for a pre-purchase inspection.
They deal primarily with Mercedes and BMW but I was told there were
always a few Porsches being serviced there.  I actually know the
mechanic through a friend.  However, he treats me like I'm an idiot
and I shouldn't even touch my car and leave the work to him.  $$$
I want a mechanic who treats ME like a mechanic and recognizes that
I do some of my own work and that I'm familiar with the inner workings
of my vehicle.  I have found one such place in Birmingham that I'm real
happy with, but like Mike, they are at least an hour away.  There
are no Porsche dealers in my city (pop 80K).

At this local shop, when I asked another mechanic there (who did the
inspection) about the clutch and how it looked through the inspection
hole, he gave me a blank stare and promptly told me there was no such
inspection hole.  I didnt argue with him, but you better believe
I'll remember that they aren't THAT familiar with Porsches. I strongly
suspect they dont have the proper Porsche tools (belt tension gauge).
I just left with a bad taste in my mouth.

Some of us may be forced to do our own work because there are no
qualified mechanics/shops nearby that we TRUST. But then point #3
makes things easier to deal with.

Subject: 356 valve guides

Thanks to everyone who submitted suggestions to my valves hitting the 
valve guides problem.  We looked at all of the possible causes you 
suggested to ensure it wouldn't happen again.  What my machine shop did 
determine is that the guides didn't have enough press fit, i.e., they 
weren't thick enough, so that when things heated up they became loose.  

Fortunately I caught the problem in time and have only a bill for a few 
hundred dollars for some new guides, valves and machine work.  It could 
have been a lot more costly.

Still don't know who did the job before, but am still trying to find out.

Subject: Investment Porsche's


Salutations p-philers,
     Today I talked with a friend who is in the market for a head-turning,
once-a-summer-month-night-on-the-town piece of garage art, and as you can
imagine, the phrase "investment automobile" came up more than once as a form
of rational.  Thus my question is:

  Which Porsche model(s) does the Net expect to have the greatest investment
  potential over the next 10-15 years?

Obviously the 356 Carrera's, 904's, and RSK's will gradually appreciate over
the years, but I'm more interested in market predictions for todays cars, i.e.
the 89 speedster or the 911sc cab.
     Personally, I feel it's ludicrous to think of any sports car as an 
investment.  To truly profit from an investment auto, one must subtract ALL
the costs of acquiring and maintaining said investment auto, like insurance, 
shipping, and storage, from the profit earned at the sale.  Then net profits
have to be higher than if you had simply put the money in the bank (which, for
all practical purposes is a "no risk" investment).  When you consider the risk
premium that automobile investing should have, the total performance of the
market is, pardon my German, shitty.  Buy a car, drive and enjoy it, but
realize that it is an expense, maybe larger, maybe smaller, but an expense none
the less.
Brent.

BTW - Anyone who disagrees with me, please feel free to flame - I love e-mail;
      It's free, It's non-confrontational, and it makes me feel important. :)

Claudia,
there tach is driven bye a shaft in the gearbox. I suggest that the problem is
one of three possibilities:
1. the wire that drive the tach has come loose at the gearbox. Finding that out
is a bit tricky, not suitable for lumberjack fingers. (likely problem)
2. the wire is worn and broken (less likely problem)
3. the drive in the gearbox is broken (never ever heard of).

Nice car, take good care of it.

I knew that problem sounded familiar!!  Car idles, but won't
accelerate correctly, and has NO power.  My =pop-off valve=   

Pat is quite correct about this flapper =pop-off valve= is made
out of aluminum.   The spring and stem of it tends disappear (or
become one with your piston) but the big piece - about the size
of a quarter - tends to hang around in the intake or jamming a
valve.  In my case it came to rest right under the valve stem on
the #3 cylinder - just waiting to get stuck.  Unfortunately, I
agree that there seems to be no solution here except replacement
of the $$$airflow meter$$$ (am I wrong on this? has anyone found
a fix?)

This failure is easy to check (unscrew the intake duct, unplug
the flapper and look inside), but if this is the problem, you get
to hunt down the part that is hanging around in the intake. (BTW
 - since it's aluminum, so a magnet won't work to grab it - try
some Bosch distributor grease - pretty sticky stuff)

Hope this isn't your problem ($$$) - decel valves are easier to
fix...

Subject: Re: Going from 2nd to 1st ger at 5500RPM's


Very Important Information:  On a Porsche 911SC 3.0L engine, there is a direct 
ratio between each RPM turned, and $1.  That is, it costs $1 for every RPM
when shifting from 2nd to 1st at 5500 RPM's!

My day of saddness has arisen...

I believe that, last night, after acidentally going from 2nd gear to 1st at 
5500 RPM (when I meant to hit 3rd), I may have just smoked my valves in my 
1981 911SC 3.0 Liter engine.  The car now runs/idles much rougher than it 
did before I decided to race that Mustang.  :-(

One call to my mechanic confirmed my speculations.  He told me that the cost
is mostly labor to do a new valve job.  Parts are about $600, and It would run 
about $4400 total to do a valve job.  He usually recommends replacing the 
engine.  He said for about $5500, I can replace the 3.0 liter engine with a 
3.2 Liter Carrera engine.  He gets the old engine, the total cost would be
the $5500 for the new engine, installed.  I would end up with 25 more HP also.
What do you people think about this price?

He asked me if the car still ran, which it does, and said it would not hurt 
the engine or car any more than the damage already done if I continue to 
drive it.  It idles rough (shakes) and idles a little lower than it did before.
It Idles around 900 rpm now and shakes, and the idle fluctuates dipping down
to about 600 rpm's and then climbing to maybe 1000.  It used to idle smothly
at around 1100.  Also, it has much less power below 2000rpm now.  But it does
start and run.  Can you say Valve Job?

For $5500, he will swap the engine with the 3.2L.  I said "But I just paid
my tuition, I don't have that much cabage ($)".   So he told me if the car
is running, I should suffer through the summer with it, and take it easy
while driving.  Is there anything I should be wary of if I continue to run
the car in the current situation?

Also, I can kind of figure that fixing what I broke may be a complex task,
and this may be a stupid question, but it cannot hurt to ask...
Is this something I can do myself?  I am pretty mechanically inclined, but
I have never cracked open a car engine before.  How difficult is replacing
the valves and whatever else I may have broken.  I have the Haynes Manual.
Should I put the winter beater $100 chevette back on the raod, buy some
jack stands, and go for it?  My feeling is that I should just start saving 
and have it done professionally, but $4400/$5500 is alot of cash.  Should
I go for the new engine option, or just have the valve job done?

Are there a motherload of other things I may have F---ed up in that split
second of downshifting, when I should have upshifted?  (ie: could I have
bent other things besides the valves?)   Can anyone give me some advice in
my time of sorrow, as to what my options are?  Selling the car is out, I
just had major body work done (911 to 930 Turbo body conversion) and the
car looks brand new.  It has 50Kmiles on it, and I plan on keeping it for
years to come.

Am I alone in this world?  Has anyone else done this stupid mistake, or
am I the only bonehead to smoke the engine in a 911?  Please tell me that
others have done this.  Is there a "We blew our engines in our 911's" 
self-help group in the Boston area that anyone can reccomend for people that 
do this?  :-)  Advice on what I can do will be welcome, I feel like I'm at a 
funeral or something.

stupid though!!! In your case you have some options, what I would consider is
first drive the clunker as soon as possible!! Next, I doubt that there is any
real major Damage that cant' be fixed on your Engine but I would not Drive it
much or very little. Save your Money, check with other shops, and when ready
have a valve job done on your Engine. My Mechanic say's about $2500 is a more
realistic number for the Valve job. Of course if your are really in love with

Barry,
  You probably feel how I did when I found my "new" 2.7 engine was not 
going to get better, and everyone recommended a replacement which was 
expensive.  Since you've got the body, I would save for either a 3.2 or a 
3.0 engine.  The 3.2's aren't that much faster than a 3.0, so you might 
just want to lighten your car to '77 specs. for more speed and save some 
money on the engine.

I'm sure that shifting from 2 to 1st gear has been done before, because 
I've seen some "gates" or sale in the Porsche mags.  Good luck.  I think 
if you look hard, you can find a good engine for < $4000 or so.

i have seen an electric 914, and i think someone on the list mentioned
seeing one autoXing not long ago.

i believe the one i have seen lives on Judith street between Blossom
Hill Avenue and Bangor street in San Jose, CA.

While there is nothing more beautiful than a well maintained P-car, there 
is nothing sadder than thinking of all that power, finesse and fine 
performance sitting in a garage under a tarp never to be exploited.  For 
me (and only for me - I acknowledge others feel quite differently for 
their own very valid reasons), the true beauty of a car like a 911 is in 
letting it do what it was built to do even if you pick up a stone chip 
here or there.  Maybe someday I'll hit the lottery and have a stable of 
"show" cars and (a larger) stable of "runners" to enjoy both ends of the 
spectrum.  Until then, I'll take cornerin' over concourse!

I had my '81 911SC smog checked at BP Sunnyvale Service Center
in Sunnyvale on South Wolfe Road, for about $24.00 certificate 
included.  The fellow who works at the gas station seems to know 
enough about Porsches to smog them correctly.  Apparently, 
he had spent some time working on Porsches in a previous job.

Subject: Re: Smog Equip

Here in British Columbia, we've been told that we have adopted smog regs 
which are equivalent to California.  I talked to a guy about engine swaps in 
B.C. and he said that the smog guidelines are based on the later of the year 
of the engine or body.

He also said that engine swap cars are analyzed on a case-by-case basis.  So 
there is room for some "rule bending".

Owning a '75 914, I'm going to have fun when I get it back on the road and 
have to take it for its 1st ever smog check.  Most docs say '75s had  
catalytic converters that year, but it isn't clear that California cars are 
the only ones.

So, when I have a 1980 3.0 ROW 911 engine in my '75 914, what do you think 
they'll do?  It'll have 40IDA3C Webers on it with headers - no air pump, 
no EGR, no pullution stuff of any kind!  Could I put some cheap catalytics on 
this engine and use those as mufflers?  Would they work?  Would they glow red 
hot and burn out and become useless?  Would they possibly harm the engine 
like the thermal reactors on the 2.7s by contributing to excessive heat in 
the head area?

If I could use catalytics as mufflers and actually have them work, I'd do 
that - it doesn't hurt to be "green".

Here's the deal: flat rate on a 911 valve job is 40 hours, plus time to 
R & R the engine, say a total of 50-55 hours. Figure that at between
$50 and $65 an hour, and you've got labor. Parts are going to be *MORE*
than $600 -- that assumes you can still use all the valves and don't need
any machine work. So I'd guess his $4400 estimate is pretty much on
target. And then you get "shipwright's disease", where you go: "Hmmmmm.
As long as I'm *IN* there..." and those dollars keep going up....

The upgrade to the 3.2, if done right, is the best thing you can do for
your SC. Based on a recent project at Ghost Racing, if you can acquire
a good engine for say $3000-3500, the $5500 figure is about right. That
means that there should be some negotiating room in there about your
old engine and it's value. If it's a "core", then it's worth about $750,
running it is worth more particularly to a shop where it could be 
rehabilitated on spare shop time at a very low hard-dollar cost and turned
for significant profit to a later customer.

When I wear my "consumer" hat, I get very sticky about such things and
want to deal on a dollar-to-dollar basis so I *KNOW* what things are
costing me.... When I wear my "shop" hat, well...

No. Just no. You don't have the tools for starters. And if you don't have
the scratch for the valve job, and you don't have friends in the biz,
you likely won't be able to afford the tools you'll need. Or the reference
materials. 

> Should

Tough call. Cheapest bet is to get with an area Porschephile buddy and
pull the engine yourself, then have it "done" by a good shop. Should
save you a thousand or so. Next best bet, cost wise, is to sell the
sucker *NOW* and get another car. You'll lose less money on that deal
than you would spend on a rebuild.  Best value if you want to keep
your car is the new engine -- if you can get that price adjusted.

Subject: 944 Turbo or Turbo S?


I am interested in purchasing a 944 Turbo ('87 - '89) or a
944 Turbo S ('88 or '89).

What is the difference between these models?

I know the Turbo S has 250 hp vs 217 hp for the Turbo.  Does the S use a
larger turbo to achieve this, and if so is the turbo lag much more
noticeable?

Does the Turbo S have better suspension and brakes?

How can one identify a 944 Turbo S from simple visual observation?

Has anyone ever tried a performance chip on these models?
I've seen some pretty impressive hp gain claims using a tweaked chip.
Is the use of a performance chip harmful to the engine?

Any other tips would be much appreciated.

Thanx,

> to a Corvette M22 tranny?

Scott,

It sounds to me like you have never driven an M22 (factory close-ratio, HD).

Here goes:  M22 shifts smoothly, cleanly and *fast*!  Never a problem shifting 
up or down at any rpm (1st gear was good to 60mph).  The 63-67 corvettes all had
provision for optional connection of shift linkage greatly reducing the throw 
distance at the cost of additional resistance.  I had this change made before 
accepting delivery, and throws were about 6" to 7" at the knob.  I ran
13.01/113.+ dead stock(!) 327ci/350hp - hydraulic lifters!  This required 
*Slamming* the shifter from 1st to 2nd, and 2nd to 3rd @6200 rpm, barely 
touching the clutch (couldn't get out of 3rd in the quarter mile with the stock 
3.70 rear end). 

My 915 frequently *crunches* when going into first when stopped, and has often 
done so if I *rush* the shift to 2nd at redline.  the extra time it requires to 
shift cleanly would, IMHO, add nearly a full second to its quarter-mile time.  I
know, there're probably not too many quarter-milers among 'philes, but a 
high-performance car should be just that, and the 915 tranny sucks rocks :)

I love my 911, but the 915 tranny is not up to the quality of the of the 
package.  The 915 tranny is delicate, and must be babied.  As for the synchros, 
they just plain don't cut it.  It's a damn shame that the 915 (specifically the 
synchro function) is not up to the quality of the rest of the package.

Bob,

My first reaction to your plight was: "Was it worth racing that Mustang?" 

I finally found some sympathy for you: Take out the engine yourself,
properly label all disconnections with tape (e.g. 1,1; 2,2; etc), separate
the transmission from the motor, strip the motor down to the long block. 
Enjoy the work on your Porsche. If you have any interest in engineering and
design, the discoveries you will make will delight you.  Bring your motor
to a reputable, independent Porsche mechanic for a valve and, possibly,
ring job. (I have a good address in the Washington DC area).  Have one of
the front crankshaft bearings inspected while the engine is out.  It will
give you some idea about the life expectancy of your crankshaft bearings.

Once you put your car back together,take Driver's education and autocrosses
offered by the Porsche Club of America.  

Finally, don't waste good Porsches on bad Fords.

Subject: Investment Porsche's

I agree that sports cars are ludicrous investments, but if you have the 
garage, the daily driver and the bucks, go for it. Porsche's tended to be 
made in much larger quantities than other makes (Ferrari, Lotus, Lambo, 
etc) but since there is a tremendous market for the old musclecars which 
used to fill every high school parking lot 15 years ago, that may not 
matter. It seems that a limited production car that is missing a top or 
that has a few extra horsies is the best bet. My vote would be for a '76 
930 (first year-how many could be left in stock original shape, including 
exhaust and tensioners?) at the $30K mark, an '89 930 (first year 5-spd) at 
$45K, or an '89 Speedster at $60K (many low mileage ones around). An 
'87-'89 factory slantnose cabriolet 930 would be great for that high school 
reunion though (rare-only ever seen one outside of Porsche gatherings-have 
actually seen more F40's and Diablo's street driven).  The problem with 
930's is that no one ever leaves them stock which diminish's collector's 
vaue. Wild cards are any documented factory Porsche race cars or 
interesting supercar class conversions; 956's, 962's, Turbo Cup 944's, 
Carerra Cup C2's, 959's (CT car for sale in Hemmings at $375K with 5k 
miles!), RSR's, RUF CTR's etc. If I were not on a Porsche list, I would 
think that early ZR-1's are a tremendous value and that the price will 
certainly go up when production is discontinued. No, I don't have a 
receding hairline.

As far as investing in something which will never lose much value in the 
short run, and appreciate in the long run, check out the resale on any 
older used 356/911 vs. it's purchase price when new and buy a new 993 to 
drive 500 miles a year, and sell in 30 years.

Barry,

No you are not the only one to have done this. A few years back I was
instructing a student at a Watkins Glen Driver's Education event. He was
driving a 944. On the second day of the event he decided to swap cars with
a friend (read: intellectually challenged friend) who owned a Carrera. It
was his first drive in a Carrera! It took only three laps before he
"upshifted" on the front straight from third to second. As incredible as it
was to see the tach swing over the 7000 mark and peg itself, I was able to
see the same thing happen two laps later in the *same* spot. The sound of
the car wasn't quite right after that, though there was no smoke from the
exhaust (I spent alot of time looking over my shoulder out the rear
window). He may have been lucky twice, but on the other hand I didn't stick
around for any discussions as he handed the car back to his friend...

Mark

P.S. I've heard that driving a car with bent valves will likely "burn" the
valves very quickly and destroy the valve guides. Not sure how much this
increases the chance of a valve breaking off and causing more damage but I
would at least get a second opinion before driving the car very much.

It doesn't look like much, but these guys really know their stuff and love to

They don't make reservations, so your best bet is to get there at least 30  
minutes before they open - especially on Saturday.  Jimmy is the shop foreman

Interestingly enough, I got almost the same treatment when I brough my '73 bug

Not ALL 3.6L came from the factory with synthetic oil.  I think the factory

I would recommend you ship them to Wheel Techniques, in Campbell, CA and 
have them polished.  I saw Lance's Carrera last week, and he has had his 
wheels polished so highly (Turbo size Fuchs) that they look chromed, even 
up close.

Well, around here (Houston is under EPA interdiction, and will be subject
to CA or stiffer requirements in '96), you'd get a *BIG* "reject" sticker
on the windshield. A '80 engine in a '75 car would be rated at '80 specs,
and in this case, require '80 CIS + cats. So, unless you can buy an
exemption somehow, if your part of the world is going to CA specs, I'd
say that you're going to have to figure out how to get your thrills in 
car that meets spec. There is one other possibility, but it involves
breaking about a zillion *OTHER* laws... All you have to do is ummm "fix" the
chassis markings and documentation to make your car be a *real* 914/6,
and then "fix" the engine number on the 3.0 to be a factory replacement
case part, and claim it's a rebuilt unit... Then you just have to meet '70
specs, which should be dead easy.

Jim,

The 3.2 and 3.6 rod bolts are 1mm smaller than the 3.0 rod bolts. The
3.3 Turbo has the same size rod bolts as the 3.2 and 3.6.

This is not a problem for people that do not exceed the factory rev.
limiter. People that race these engines usually change the chips in
the cars to increase the rev. limiter by 300 to 500 RPM. The valve
springs and rod bolts really can't handle this. It is fairly simple
to change the valve springs and spring retainers to eliminate the valve
float, but it is not cheap to replace the rod bolts unless you are
already in there. So, many people do not.

Raceware makes rod bolts that are supposed to be much better. But I
have not heard anuthing about them at all. Anyone else??

Subject: Re: 944 w/ oil in coolant

Ty, Pat -

Oil/water mixing is a common enough problem, esp. in the MY87 normally
aspirated cars.  The cure has been an updated seal kit, green in
colour.  (Porsche seems to change colours as they update rubber seals.)

There has more recently been a tech bulletin or two regarding proper
shimming of the connector pipe on cars without the oil/water heat
exchanger: 944 Turbo and 944S2.  Same consideration applies to cars
with the exhanger, though.  The shims are available from PCNA, and
the bulletins and manuals tell you what and how to measure.  The
connector pipe is a short piece internal to both the oil/water
heat exchanger manifold (924S, 922, 944S) and the oil cooler style
of manifold (944S2, 944 Turbo/S, 968?).

Pat, these seem to be the only fixes.  As far as I know, with updated
seals and correct shimming, there is no real future failure rate.

Rather basic, I know, but here goes . . . .

1.  Any suggestions for exterior cleaning (I use the typical dishwashing 
soap for other cars, with car sponge, but this is my baby we're talking 
about now . . . .).  Lots of bugs have met their demise on windscreen and 
front dam as well.

2.  I have the brown bottle of Meguire's liquid wax, No. 6 (which is a hold 
over from my previous 911).  Should I use this on my 84 "metallic" paint?

3.  For wheels (stock), does everyone follow manual and apply petroleum 
jelly every three months?  Also, evidently brake dust was left on longer 
than it should have been in the past and chrome is a little pitted.  Any 
remedy short of buying new wheels?

4.  Interior is leather for which I am loking for a preservative 
(especially with this hot, sunny summer).

5.  Dash is black (perfect condition).  Question is: is entire dash 
leather or is top vinyl?  What should I use on this to preserve it (if 
different from seats)?  Feels like something like Armor All has been used 
in the past.

6.  Armor All for Targa top?

Hi, Trond.
 
If you're in Europe and looking for model cars, your best bet is mail order
from England. Try Brian Harvey, in Radlett, England, I think. I don't
have the address or telephone number but perhaps international directory
assistance can help. There are also model car magazines which are certain to
carry his ads.
 
Another source is Modelcar Danhausen in Germany. I don't like dealing with
them because they have a huge catalog but it seems that NOTHING is ever in
stock. Kleinkoelnstr. 20/22, 5100 Aachen, Germany, 0241/49805; I'm not sure
they're still in business.
 
Would you settle for a Boxster instead of a 550? <g> Maisto, I think, already
has a Boxster model on the market. Cost here about $25. You should have no
trouble finding large American tanklike models, Cadillacs and such. Perhaps
a pickup truck.

Hi, Trond.
 
Regarding concours 356 restoration costs, you have no IDEA what Americans do
to restore their cars for concours. When that $50,000 job is done, you do
NOT drive the car. You store it in a plastic bag and transport it in a
sealed trailer. This is no longer a car; it is a device intended solely as
tech art or sculpture, and for the purpose of collecting tin plates and pots
to put on the shelf.
 
If you took a brand new 1995 911, directly from the end of the assembly line,
put it in a plastic bag, loaded it on a truck, took it to the airport, flew
it to New York right now and entered it in the upcoming Porsche Club of
America Parade concours, the car would absolutely not stand a chance of
winning, or even getting a good placing.
 
Concours cars, at least those with a serious chance of taking a trophy, are
vastly over-restored. My blue car, one-owner, will never have a chance to
win. There are, for example, runs in the black paint under the dash. I have
original glass all around, and put away a stock of Sekurit windshields when
I heard they were going out of production with the original labels, but a
concours car will need new glass, with the correct labels. What do you
suppose it will cost to find new old stock windshields (not just a new piece
of glass that fits, which is easy enough to get?) Another item is wheel date
stamps. These are easy to check and concours people insist on having all 5
stamps identical, even though the cars usually left the factory with several
different date stamps on the wheels. (Does anybody seriously think Hans und
Franz, working at the tire mounting machine in Zuffenhausen, looked at the
date stamps of the wheels as they took them off the shelf? Concours people
think so...) Here's another item. You can get replacement bumper trim and
rocker trim for nominal cost, but like so many repro items available today,
it is not exactly the same as original. A car with repro has no chance
against a car with perfect original. So for concours, somebody may have to
specially make the correct rubber profile to go in the aluminum strips. You
make this by taking rubber from several cars. The rubber has shrunk over the
years, so you may be 2 or 3 cm short on each end of a trim strip. On the
front and rear, you can hide the splice under the bumper guards. On the
side, you may have to carefully dress the spliced area.
 
Here's another interesting bit of concours trivia. Many serious concours
people don't have working engines. It would be disastrous to have oil leaks,
so they don't put oil in them. For that matter, many engines are assembled
only finger-tight; you can take them apart with a set of sockets and your
fingers, no ratchet. They do this so they can clean them better.
 
And the list of oddities in the Dead Car Society goes on. Now do you see how
they can run up a $50K bill in short order?

Here's the info:

'87 944 Turbo, red/tan leather interior, 75k (mostly highway) miles, 
excellent condition, all maintenance records, always garaged, no winters, 
all new belts.   

The car is located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  I'm willing to negotiate
on delivery to other parts of the country.

My asking price is $14.5/obo for the car plus some maintenance parts and 
full shop manuals.  This is a little higher than prices I've seen mentioned
for the coasts, but is lower than most prices I've seen in the midwest.
Plus, this car is much better shape, both mechanically and exterior/interior,
than cars I've seen advertised in the papers ect.

I am, of course,  willing to negotiate on the price and I will consider 
partial trades.

If you are interested at all, send me email and we can at least talk.

which is checking for adequate rotor depth.  The rotors are big, cast
iron heat sinks, and if you run with N% less rotor, they experience
a corresponding temperature rise.

Subject: 912 wheel rechroming

Hi, Neil.
 
I can probably send out your wheels to be straightened and replated along
with a batch of my own wheels. Where/how badly are they bent?
 
There is no point in trying to save the rims if they are bent, or if there
are rust pits in the lowest groove where water and brake dust tend to
collect. To be replated, the centers have to be cut out anyway; whether you
get the old rims welded back on later, or fresh rims, is immaterial and
invisible, and it's easier to just trash the rims if there is anything at
all wrong with them. Rims are cheap and common; centers with the correct
dates and stamps and logos and bolt pattern are not, and those are the parts
to be saved. The cost is the same either way, new rims on old centers or old
rims on old centers.
 
Also, do you have 4.5 or 5.5 inch rims? I would recommend going to 5.5 if
you don't have those already. You can put on more modern rubber. With 4.5
you are limited to less than high performance tires. I have 5.5 x 15 rims
with 195/60 x 15 Bridgestone RE71 on my 356 daily driver.
 
I'm in Southern California.
 
Prices for wheel replating is about $75 for regular chrome, $110 for
three-layer "show chrome." Plus shipping.

Barry,

First off, you're not the "only bonehead" in this world to have done
this sort of thing.  A friend did a 5-to-2 in the first run group
Friday past at the PCA Bridgehampton Club Race.  In between managing
our own race car that day, we managed to get his engine out and torn
down.  The car's a stock '89 911T, running in class J.  We located
a set of 2.0 litre heads someone had prepped and on the shelf, and had
them brought down Friday night.  Got up at 5AM the next day, and had
the engine rebuilt in time to win his class in the race.  All this in
brutally hot weather, outdoors in the Bridgehampton paddock.

As to what other joys lurk under the skin of your engine, it's hard
to say.  In our case, there was a snapped rocker arm and some minor
marring of a cam lobe.  In general, a broken rocker could do all
sorts of nasties in the cam housing and potentially to the head(s).

I think the idea of continuing to run the car is a pretty bad one
on the part of the mechanic who suggested it.  Kind of guarantees
that you'll want to throw the engine away.

I agree with what Stan writes.  Ultimately, the decision whether to
repair it yourself vs. the other possibilities comes down to a
question of just how badly you want to learn and do the work.  You
certainly wouldn't be the first novice to tackle such a project.  And
you wouldn't be the first to really screw it up royally, if you did.

You would have to invest in a bunch of rather specialized tools, like
a dial indicator and holder, 46 mm socket for cam nut (maybe), valve
guide removal and installation tools, valve cutting and lapping
stuff, engine stand, plus a bunch of other stuff I either forget or
take for granted.  Workshop manuals too.

This is the black plastic (I think) on the engine deck lid that covers 
the oil cooler.

There is mainly only cosmetic damage, although two of the four prongs 
that hold it to the body ar off.  It looks as though it may have nicked the 
oil cooler fans slightly underneath.

I've only looked at the Automotion catalog, where it looks like this part 
is $167.  I've also sent a fax inquiry to Partsheaven to see if they have 
any used.

Should I be unable to get a replacement for under $150 or so, should I 
consider a ducktail or whaletail?  At what speeds do these realistically 
aid in holding the car down.  I have seen ducktails available in the $300 
range, and whaletails in the $500 + range.   I like the stock look, and 
don't want to deal with painting the new part, but if there is added 
functionality or stability to be gained, I will consider it.  Thanks.

Subject: P.A.P. incident

This message is a question as well as a gripe.  Don't worry, it has
nothing to do with anyone here.  Who it does have to do with is P.A.P. in
Atlanta.  We(my boss and I) ordered a '79 3.3 turbo engine(911 that is),
supposedly rebuilt and paid quite a few thaousand dollars for it.  We
installed the engine in the intended vehicle and drove.  We only got 100
miles on it before we could hear air sucking in at the heads.  We checked
the torque on the head bolts and doing so broke three with about ten
ft-lbs.  Then the engine came out and apart.  At this point PAP had agreed
to send us new head studs and repay us for labor involved.  They told us
that the new studs were brand new from Germany and not from an older batch
that was recalled because of weakness.  Surprise, surprise, as the engine
sat on the engine stand, two of the "new" studs broke.  

But it doesn't end there.  While we had the engine apart we noticed that
the rocker arms were loose.  So loose that one of them was halfway to
falling out.  All the rest were worn or rusted beyond use as were the cam
housings(They did send us new housings).  Furthermore, the cams were
mismatched.  One was from a turbo, while the other was an SC cam!  The
turbo charger itself even had rust inside it.  

When all was said and done, and the extra 15+ valve shims had been
removed.  We calledback PAP(they had requested that we wait till the
engine was done before calling back).  The wonderful salesman who was
trying to work with us must have just gotten done with a friendly chat
with the owner whose name, I think is Joe.  Our salesman, who had
previously said that it would all be taken care of in parts credit at the
very least, informed us that the boss supposedly said "F**k them, we don't
need their business anyway".  Although our salesman is doing his best, I
don't see much hope in getting back the $500 in machine work or
compensation for the numerous days of personal work.

This is not a complaint as much as it is a warning.  I don't do business
in that manner, and neither does MY company.  I believe that people should
be informed when such blatantly rude situations occur.  Hopefully people
will think twice before ordering from a company that treats a long time

I did that in a Mercedes when a cotter pin fell out of the shift linkage.
I lit up the tires before I could dump the clutch back in. The car ran
rough for a couple of days then straightened itself out - divine intervention?

Although it's hard not to be pessimistic in such circumstances, it's a 
good idea to do a leakdown test and compression check before taking things
apart. The sudden change in intake pressure "could" have just caused a
leak somewhere, or you could have blown a pile of carbon loose, causing
temporary problems. Engine R&R and disassembly will cost the same in labor
whether the engine is broken or not, so it's a good idea to determine the
extent of the problems before you dive in.

Good luck!

Hi

The A/C on my '83 SC is very low on Freon. The compressor turns, but
the air coming through the vent is almost unnoticeably cooler than the 
outside air. The little ball in the sight glass doesn't move AT ALL, and
that can't be a good sign.

Can anyone recommend a shop for recharging my A/C in greater Boston?
Should I have them check for leaks too?

Thanks in advance!

This is insane, who cares whether your rubber profile is a clone of the 
original or something as close as possible. If you bend down and look at a

Subject: 911 Oil Coolers & stuck thermostats

I have owned my 930 for around 9 months now, during that time I have noticed
that the oil temperature never gets very high - weel not even out of the first 
little box. Originally I diagnosed this to a faulty temp. sender, replacement 
didnt cure it so I put it down to the Great British temparature - too damn cold. 

 Since then I have told this tail to a number of Porsche drivers who respond
with "you are not driving it hard enough" - well possibly but.......

Following a recent discussion with the mechanincs who look after my car they
suggested that the oil thermostat is stuck open (right direction at least) and  auxilary cooler is always being fed - hence the low temperature oil. This 
appears reasonable as the feed pipes are always hot regardless of how the car
has been driven. 

I fancy doing the replacement myself but the mechanics suggested that there 
could be problems in removeing the old one due the the position/mounting and
the amount of force needed to undue the bits - it could get expensive if I 
bogged it.  Has anyone done this job themselves and how easy is it?

    If you've got the stock 914/4 calipers on the back, you *should* be able
to simply hook up the e-brake as in the original 4.  There's a lever that
"mechanically" (no hydraulics?) actuates the piston in the rear caliper.
If you want the 911S brakes on the back end (may balance the car better...)
you can get the trailing arm conversion kit from Vellios--it has some sort
of adaptor gizzie that lets you use the 911 e-brake (the little drum).

I know someone that claims to be able to do so.  He publishes a

Subject: 911 Alignment

Dear Porsche Pushers:
	I wander if the net has seen the following problem...


On my 84 Carrera Targa I recently replaced the upper strut bearings on the
front suspension. They go between the body and they isolate the suspension
struts via rubber mounts.

While trying to align it, I was told by a competent shop that they could not
bring caster and camber to where they should be. It seems that they ran out
of travel for adjustments. I believe it is close to specs, but not exact. 

The specifications were checked from both the Technical booklet and also from
Bruce Anderson's Performance book (BTW, they we both the same).

As far as I know, the car has never been in an accident, has low mileage and its
ride height is within published specs.

When I bought the bearings I was told that they were both the same part # on 
both sides. If I installed them reversed, assuming there is an inner and outer
side to them, that might explain the running out of camber adjustment. But I
no idea how that could affect caster adjustment.

Have any of you encountered alignemnt problems on that vintage Porsches?

Do you positively know if there are two part #s? (L + R)  If not could I have 
installed them reversed? They are easy to exchange, but it would mean having
the car aligned again. :(

What does the net think?

Thanks in advance!!

In *theory*, the electric motor is the sports-car fanatics dream
device.  Maximum torque at 0 RPM, and almost completely flat torque
curve from there to whatever maximum it's got.  Instant "throttle"
response.  Small, light, compact.  And it doesn't even drip anything
on the garage floor...

The problem with electric motors is the energy requirement, and the
current state of battery technolocy.  These are the exact antithesis 
of what sports-car lovers want -- large, heavy, usually toxic or explosive
or both, and their power curve falls off as charge diminishes.  

An electric Porsche would -- or at least could and should -- be an
enthusiast's dream come true, at least once the engineers work out
a reasonable solution for getting sufficient voltage and current to 
the electric motors.  And I do mean motors -- consider a Carrera 4
with individual electric motors for each wheel, with adaptive logic
measuring traction and grip and modulating power to each corner of
the car to maximize acceleration and deceleration dynamically for
all load conditions.  The engine and electronics technologies exist
for building such a car *today* -- but it would either have to weigh
eight thousand pounds to have enough batteries, or it would have to
run on a very long power cord.

BTW, electric motors are also very susceptible to hot-rod tuning and
performance enhancements, as anyone who ever raced RC cars or slot cars
(the latter, in my case) understands.  I'm actually looking forward to
the first really workable electric cars, cars with reasonably priced,
lightweight batteries and high-capacity motors.  Besides, if the laws
in California get any tighter, an electric Porsche is likely to be
the only one we'll actually be able to buy out here...

and by dragging his suspension along the ground.
    Terry took it fairly well, all things considered.  He joked about all 
the Motul dribbling onto the ground from the sheared brake line, and 
mentioned that he might actually have to have Marcel repainted.  I think 
that he was happy that this happened near home, as opposed to on the way 
to Parade or even *at* Parade.  A pair of floor jacks was used to lift up 
the front end, and Marcel was rolled up onto the trailer that the Neidels 
generously donated.
    So, all you who're going to Parade this year, if you see a red 
soft-window targa going very fast on the autocross course, stop by and 
congratulate Terry for getting Marcel running so quickly.
    I'm not sure if this story has a moral, but if it does, I guess that 
it's that sh** happens, even when you check all the reasonable failure 
points.

Subject: Re: Porsche 915 Tranny vs. Corvette M22


Bart,
I have not followed this thread from the beginning so I may be
out of line in this response but here goes.
I have to disagree with you on your description of the Muncie
Rockcrusher (M22) tranny. They are a very loud and rather hard
shifting especially downshifting into first. I've been running
M22s for about 18 years in the same car. The motor is ussually
a 427 but some times a spare 396. Currently I'm running 4.88
gears but have run 3.70s, 4.10s, and 4.56s behind different M22s.
My wife won't drive the car on the street with the M22 but she
will with an M21. Unfortunately the M21s only last a couple of 
track outings before becoming a grenade, but they do shift
nicely. (Luckily you can do a complete tranny swap in 15
minutes.)

The M22 was built for high horse power and/or abuse and they
give up some smoothness. Other than the M22, how many street
trannies come with a straight cut first gear? Even though
they are loud and some times grind shifts, I rarely miss a shift.

The tranny in my 930 is also a little tough to shift on the street
especially downshifting into first as well (they are not known for
their smoothness). But it is much smoother and quieter than the M22.
On the track the 930s tranny feels different, to the point that I don't
even notice it, it must like high RPMs. I rarely miss a shift.

Note: my wife does not like the 930 tranny either but she will
drive it, and it does not announce her arrival at a stoplight
like the M22.

Subject: concours cars and "drivers"



I went to our local PCA-NNJR concours workshop at Paterek Brothers
a couple of weeks ago. (John will be head judge at the PARADE this year)

There were lots of helpful hints for getting and keeping an absolutely
perfect scratch-free finish on your car. Paterek uses Imperial Hand Glaze
(a small amount rubbed on hard by hand in the direction the wind flows over
the car) followed by a minute amount of Blitz Wax (a dab for an entire panel
rubbed in one direction until it disappears) He used very well worn t-shirts
and said if you ever drop one, throw it away.  For scratches or overspray
areas, he uses a tiny dab of Blue Magic - a more abrasive cleaner - in a 
dollop of the Imperial Hand Glaze and works out the scratch. The results 
were truely stunning on someone's black 930.

There were also some great car cleaning tips and hints. The stated PURPOSE of
these events is to teach Porsche owners how to keep their cars in the best 
possible condition.

When they got to the "trunk" area, something went haywire. This is where
the concerned owners are separated from those with severely anal behavior.
They were spreading the pliers in the toolkit out as far as they would go
to look for rust and old grease. Heaven forbid anyone would actually use a
tool - rendering it useless for future concours events! I zoned out when
the guy started probing into the space-saver spare tire with Q-tips to look
for any trapped dust. 

There was a guy with a brand new 993 showing everyone how easy it was to
pop the headlight assemblies out weekly (daily)  and clean behind them. 
I got a little chuckle when I asked if they would still stay in under 
threshold braking after being removed so much.

I came away with an appreciation of what it takes to keep a car looking
great, but with a feeling that just these weren't my kind of people. 
In the computer world, they would be the ones who use "keyboard condoms"
and put a dust cover on their computers at the end of the day. Not that
I'm critical, it's just not my thing.

I'll drive mine, thanks.

Subject: 944 performance chips

Porscheophiles,

I'm thinking of increasing the fun factor of my '86 944 by installing a
performance upgrade kit. I'm looking at the one "Performance Products"
offers, which consists of a new throttle cam, free flow air filter and an
Authority Performance chip, at around $400.

Does anyone have any experience with this kit? The catalog shows some
impressive graphs, but does this correspond to some good perceived
performance gains? Also, do these kits increase the stress on the engine
significantly? In Australia at least I remember that ads for Porsches often
had "never chipped" in them, leading one to believe that the use of
performance chips might decrease engine life expectancy. Althought that may
be just because people who use these things are more likely to drive hard
:-). The other concern I have is if this air filter works as well as normal
ones.

I'd be grateful for any info anyone can give me on performance upgrades,
especially comparisons between this one and any other ones around, and
if the price is reasonable.

Thanks,
	Jeff

This is one of the "classic" 944 engine problems.  My car has had this
trouble a couple of times.  Typically the oil leaks at the highest rate
when the engine is the hottest. The shop manager at Carlsen Porsche told
me that they can not fix this problem permanently but since they have a
two year warranty on parts an labor at least I can get it fixed again 
for free (my car goes in the shop tomorrow).  If your car is just leaking
a small amount of oil then you don't need to worry about it.  Just change
the coolant if it looks too contaminated.  If it leaks more, so that oil
shows up after an hour after changing to new coolant, then it needs to be
fixed.  The greatest danger is not in having the oil contaminating the
water but in the water being pushed back into the oil when the engine is
shut off and the oil pressure drops to zero.  To prevent this from
happening you can open your radiator cap every time you shut the engine
down to releave the pressure in the cooling system.  This is what I have
been doing for the last week and a half since my leak started again.

Subject: Re: cleaning materials

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Jerry Mac was saying:

	Rather basic, I know, but here goes . . . .
	
	1.  Any suggestions for exterior cleaning (I use the typical dishwashing 
	soap for other cars, with car sponge, but this is my baby we're talking 
	about now . . . .).  Lots of bugs have met their demise on windscreen and 
	front dam as well.

I use a chamois-covered sponge -- makes it much easier to run those stubborn
stains away.
	
	2.  I have the brown bottle of Meguire's liquid wax, No. 6 (which is a hold 
	over from my previous 911).  Should I use this on my 84 "metallic" paint?

I'd be interested in hearing what people have to say about waxes, esp. the
Meguires vs. the Zymol.  I'm up for spending a few bucks on a good wax, but
which one?  The paint on my car is Alpine White -- which Zymol do I order?  
I also read in the owner's manual that Porsche specifically recommends
that abrasive polishes (e.g., Meguires) *not* be used as they will damage the
(elasticity?) of the paint.  What's the word on the street?
	
	3.  For wheels (stock), does everyone follow manual and apply petroleum 
	jelly every three months?  Also, evidently brake dust was left on longer 
	than it should have been in the past and chrome is a little pitted.  Any 
	remedy short of buying new wheels?
	
I've never heard of this, but for those darn recessed lug-nut wells, that
like just the thing I've been looking for.  I'm sure you can get the wheels
re-chromed (although I don't know how much that would cost), or maybe a little
elbow grease and chrome polish will take care of it (if you haven't already
tried that).

	4.  Interior is leather for which I am loking for a preservative 
	(especially with this hot, sunny summer).

I've been considering getting some sheepskin covers.  No, they're not cheap,
but they're *great* for hot summers, esp. in cars with dark interiors.  And
they're nice and warm in the winter, too.  Stay away from the matching
steering wheel covers... (They slip.)
	
	5.  Dash is black (perfect condition).  Question is: is entire dash 
	leather or is top vinyl?  What should I use on this to preserve it (if 
	different from seats)?  Feels like something like Armor All has been used 
	in the past.

If it's vinyl, I've had good luck with the Armor All "low-gloss" spray.  Just
be sure to spray it on a cloth and not directly on the dash (or the overspray
will cause your windshield to get all smeary and fog up easily).  Now if I
could just find one that repels dust...  For leather, Lexol does wonders,
although it doesn't provide any UV protection.
	
	6.  Armor All for Targa top?

I've heard some people saying that something (Crystal Clear?) is supposedly
better than Armor All, but I think just about anything (Armor All, STP Son-of
a-Gun) is OK.  I worry the most about UV protection and only secondarily about
a glossy shine.  I also just spray a healthy amount of Armor All on my tires
as a last step and never wipe it off.  My tires tend to stay blacker longer.

I have been a customer for more than five years and have had all sorts
of wheel work done on Fuchs.  Their specialty is polishing, painting, and
repairing (they send out all the chrome work, including the hand painting
of hub cap crests).

His prices are very good, if you "work" with him (ahem).  And the results
are excellent.  Mention my name.  I won't/don't benefit from it but I'm
trying to get him to understand about porschephiles and give us a discount.
These wheel jocks don't understand electronic networks very well so
I'm not sure I'm getting through.  But if he hears it's a referral he will go
into negotiation mode with you.  And he *loves* 911's.

FWIW, I had him do a full polish of my 7's and 9's (16"), black paint on
the inside, polish all lugs and HRS locks, polish center caps, hand paint
center caps, and do cosmetic repair of rims (curb scrapes by prior
owner -- okay I did some).  Including dismount, mount and balance, I
paid under $600 (retail is $850).  Took five days.  He'll lend you cookie
cutters or spare Fuchs while he does the work.  Polished Fuchs are hard
to distinguish from chrome.

Allow me to offer another perspective.   As someone who bought my Porsche
knowing full well a family was in the near future, and as someone who
may have to consider selling the 911 for the same reasons, I can relate
to your dilema:

IMHO, the cost issue is the wrong metric to use for your decision.  This
is a decision you need to make with your heart, not your head.  If it
would hurt you to have to sell this thing for the reasons you mentioned,
why do it when you'll only regret it the rest of your life??  Also,
I'd hate to grow up as your kid and hear about the car you had to sell
because of me ;^)  (you may laugh, but think about it).

On the other hand, if you really are ready to re-prioritize your life and
you've had this car long enough, go ahead and sell it and buy a better one
next time with a clear heart and a fresh start.  

Seriously, when I am a father (due on Dec 12 BTW!) it is going to be 
really hard to rationalize the 3rd car if we run into any $$ challenges.
I may be able to sell the 911 happily knowing I got to experience
it fully for a time and I will look forward to the next.  On the other
I may not be ready and I'll find a creative work-around.  

Either way, I resolve not to let money drive the decision.  Money
isn't the reason you have that car is it?  Why should it be the
reason to sell it? (assuming you're not in some catastrophic situation
where you don't have the luxury to contemplate it).

Passion is the reason you have the car, and passion of some sort should
be the rationale for parting with it or keeping it.

As always:  Your mileage may vary!!

Subject: Re: Porsche 915 Tranny vs. Corvette M22

I haven't used a Porsche 915 tranny, but following Porsche's rule of thumb 
where everything evolves and gets better year after year, I'd imagine that it 
works better than the 914 (901) tranny.  I had my '73 914 with a 2.1L 
4-banger shifting excellently - never missing a shift.  My '75 with a small 
2.3L 911 engine with a 7500 RPM redline worked well with a 914 tranny too.

I can imagine that the 915 should work better.  I haven't tried speed 
shifting much, since I was taught to be "smooth" when driving, not fast and 
choppy.

Considering other "exotic" cars, particularly Italian ones, I'd say that 
Porsche makes good trannys and shifters.  I recently had the opportunity to 
drive a Ferrari 348 on the track and a Lamborghini Diablo on the street - 
these cars have the absolute worst shifting I have ever experienced!  It 
isn't fun coming into a hairpin from 110mph and trying to slow down and 
downshift into 2nd for the turn - I was always fighting with the tranny, 
trying to jam the thing into 2nd.  Apparently, the shifting at that time was 
the best of the day - it's worse when it's cold!!!

The funny thing is, Ferraris et all are allowed to be "quirky".  Can you 
imagine the negative press if a Honda Civic shifted like that???

in his BMW 633 and has noticed a slight increase in fuel economy (about 5% 
better milage).  What do you think?  Are there any horror stories out there?  
Would you put this in *YOUR* car?

Lou,

Not sure if this is your problem.  The shop I hang around has seen a lot
of 911's which cannot be brought into camber spec because of sagging
in the strut, between the vertical member and the spindle, which are
welded to one another.  They recently had a machinist make up a tool,
basically a protractor, which they can use to first calibrate the
angle.  They correct the angle, then add two gussets to make sure
things stay put in the future.

In extreme cases, the weld can altogether fail.  This happened to a
friend at a track last summer.

I went to start my '81 911 this morn and a loud "backfire" occured.  This car  
has never backfired before.  Now, the car will not start.  It will fire but    
wont run.  I talked w/ my mechanic and he said my airbox is probably toast. He 
said he usually installs a pop-off valve in there but I don't have one.        
                                                                               
Couple of questions:                                                           
 1) Why did this happen?                                                       
 2) My mechanic said if he can *repair* it, it will cost about $200-           
    Is that a reasonable price and what do folks think about a "repaired" air  
    box versus a new one? (BTW, I think he said a new one would be about $600) 
 3) Is there anything I can do to get it running well enough to drive the 50mi 
    to the shop instead of paying the tow charge?                              
 4) I have decent  tinkering skills, any thoughts on making this a "do-it-your 
    selfer"??

Subject: 'Solid Rust Treatment.'

Hi,

I'm about to seal off the floor area on my '58 356. I'm going to clean out 
the wheelhouses and seal'em off too. What I wonder is ;

For some areas it is almost impossible for the wire brush to get into. Would 
you recommend using something like 'rust mort' before I spray on the sealer 
in those areas?
There is no rust there, but I'd like the whole undercarriage to be 'all 
black and neat...'

I've used Zinc primer *every* place I've worked to the bare metal. I believe 
this will be a good protection for the weld seams. Then I've used Dinitrol 
over the Zinc coating and a cheaper 'body-mass' on top in areas which will 
take stonechipping etc.

Can anyone recommend whether or not to use the ordinary 'body-mass' in the 
wheelhousing or should I use the special 'stone-chip' products available?

It is really great therapy to see the red replacement panels covered with 
black undercarriage protection products.

 I measured my cars alignment last weekend and found the front and rear axle 
to be within a millimeter aligned. My 'special made' chassi straighteners 
(the pieces to mount between the torsion bars) really stood up for the test 
then!

Otherwise I've come to page 24 on a little 356body restoration manual I'm 
writing, just waiting for some photos I've taken to be developed until I'll 
go any further. Guess it could be about 100 pages including color photographs.

If you have the possibillity to read Word files it'll be possible to see the 
result in a couple of months...... The file will be huge as the scanned 
photos are real memory eaters. Say 10 Meg zipped?! I will try to give you 
ftp access for it, but possibly I will have to find another way as we have a 
'high-restriction' site here at  'hrp.no' (.........the next building 
dhhalden.no site I guess?!)

The free flow air filter has shown 1-2 HP gain on our dyno (assuminmg it 
is a K&N or similar) The good thing about them is that this gain is 
consistent and the filter lasts much longer. The bad thing is that they 
cost a lot of money and don't really give that much more performance.

The revised throttle cam is a new one on me, Does this simply give a 
greater opening for a given degree of throttle movement. If so there is 
not gain in performance, only a perceived gain as you need to move the 
throttle less to get the butterfly open the same!

Chips from  Autothority, or my company Superchips should all be the same, 
in that the gains come from advancing the ignition timing to use only 92 
octane gas. The extar benefits come from altering rev limiters and other 
incidentals. As far as I am aware only Autothority and Superchips alter 
the timing on part throttle to give more performance in normal driving. 
This probably has a similar effect to a throttle cam.

You should be able to feel the difference when you install the chip. The 
chips do not harm the engine unless it has too much advance and causes 
pinging. The adverts "never chipped" are simply a reference to the fact 
that chipping it means that the owner probably ran the car hard. It is 
also a hang over from the early days o"chipping from when I designed the 
first chips for the Cosworth Sierra. They were designed to run at 14 PSI 
boost maximum and people often turned them up to 17 PSI where there was 
always damage caused by the engine running lean. Usually head gaskets 
went and then heads warped and at $1500 for a replacement the originals 
went back on and the cars were sold quickly.

Hope it helps

Subject: Tire turnig/direction

My understanding of the prescribed direction for tire-wheel rotation
on most ZR-rated tires is designed to accomodate the "tread bonding" 
stability during high stress: for the front wheels -it should be apposite to
normal forward motion (breaking consideration); rear wheels -in the direction of
rotation (acceleration consideration).

Is this NOT the case for all tires. Another possibility -the direction arrow 
is for water "channeling". In short, is the concern for bonding sheering-stress
limit or ... ? 

The Donlup I have D40/M2 the arrows for front and back are in
the "normal" forward direction of rotation.

I don't believe the shop manager.  Porsche has updated seal kits and

I spoke to my local independent porsche shop asking if he had seen anyone
cooling their 911s with water and he said he had. The problems he indicated 
were corrosion and minerals build up. But he said it seemed to work. So for
this summer I think I'll give it a try. I have new high tech. self cleaning
misting jets but I believe the need  about 40 psi to work properly. Anyone 
got a good idea on how to generate that sort of pressure or any other comments.
Obvious choice would be a injection fuel pump but what about corrosion? I
would use that filtered water from the 25 cent vending machines. Anyone know
how the "pure" water compares with distilled?

I'm willing to bet it isn't going to happen. I don't see any groundbreaking
for all the power plants that will be required. We're going to see lots of
fleets buying electric cars -- utility companies and government fleets -- at
high prices. A few may be bought by the same types of people who used to buy
civilian Checker Marathons. Consumers will avoid electric cars, instead
buying the cheaper old-tech product. The rationale will be "It's OK for
government and public utilities to buy them; at least it's not MY money."
Never mind what purchasing electric cars at 2 or 3x the price of an
equivalent cheap gas model does to your utility or tax bill.

Subject: 914 parts database


In the interest of trying to catalog all my 914 parts (having
two cars in pieces in the basement makes it tough :-)) I have 
made a start of entering 914 part numbers into the computer. 
The format I came up with is as follows:

PorschePartNumber	NewPrice	UsedPrice	Description

Each field is separated by a tab, and each price is identified by
the vendor from whence it came (e.g., [aa] for Automobile Atlanta).

I have included prices as I would like to sell off some of the parts
I have to finance the storage costs for my other 914s, etc.

The parts database is growing as I actually enter my inventory
into the system (I wrote some programs to help me with all this). 
One entire car is almost labeled and identified, I will post
when it is finished.

If you are interested in helping to expand the parts entered so
far, or in proofing what I have done, or just curious you can
get a copy of the file by sending mail to info@tac3.vv.hac.com.
That is automated mail server.  It you send it the following
in the body of your message it will send you the parts database:

send
* 914/parts.db

There is also an invent.db file there, which is part of inventory
I have added, but it isn't complete yet.  If you have questions
about it drop me a line.

Hope someone gets some benefit out of this, Alex (noorder@tac3.vv.hac.com)

Me too, was wondering if anyone here uses Turtle clearcoat after waxing 
their car?  My car sits 10+ hours in the sun each day.  I'm leery of 
clear coating on the car because the prev. owner put some kind of gunk 
over the paint that just won't come off.  Every thorough wash job, a 
little bit of it peels of, kind of like a thin layer of sap.

I'm also looking for leather restoral/protectant, but will probably

I've used the Kragen .99 cent bottles of Quicksilver wheel cleaner on my

Porsche approved like the P21s solution.

For Dash,  I had a store on Moorpark in San Jose custom cut a piece of 
velour (tan) that covered the dash perfectly.  Doesn't look that great, 
but covers it well, and has vents for the defrost/heater.  Cost about $34 
I believe.

If Neil's wheels are steel and have chrome plating on them, polishing is
not going to get rid of pits and corrosion. If they are aluminum and would
benefit from polishing, they should not be chromed. Question is, does Neil
have steel or aluminum wheels? I got the impression they are steel.
 
Bent steel rims are easy to fix while you're rechroming -- just throw away
the bent rim and weld a new one to the center after the old chrome has been
stripped. Bent aluminum is harder and more expensive to fix.

Re: Electric 914 in Bay Area:  "...is nothing sacred?"

Not sure if you're aware of this, but the very first car built by Dr.
Ferdinand Porsche, at the beginning of this century, was electric.  Four
motors in the wheel hubs, driven by a gasoline engine-generator; what we
nowadays would call a "hybrid electric vehicle".  This was a setup he
found fundamentally elegant and returned to again and again (c.f. the
WWII Tiger Tank), much as he did to horizontally opposed engines (and
swing axle suspensions, gosh darn it).  

I'm sure he'd be delighted at the current wave of interest in electric
vehicles, everything from the hobbyist-converted 914's to the gas
turbine/flywheel hybrid racecar from Chrysler.

Unless you are wedded to Porsche label materials (see discussion re 
concourse), when I bought my 76 911 a few years back, there were no seat 
belts.  I went to the local NAPA store and bought stock black lapbelts 
that adjusted the "old" way (no tensioners or retractable pulleys; just 
adjustment like the seatbelts of yore and the seatbelts on airplanes 
still).  They were cheap :-) and, because they adjusted without the use 
of tensioners, worked MUCH better for the small lap and carseat we 
strapped into the back.  I found our 84 with "Porsche" lapbelts which 
work on the tensioner like the front belts are alot more difficult to 
work with for a carseat and are not as "snug" on my 5 year old.

You definitely should have the pop-off valve installed.  I don't know if 
there's a way to get your car running at this point.  My '77 with SC 
engine blows the pop off valve about once a week, but my backfiring is 
due to my cold start circuitry not hooked up. 

Consider an aluminum air filter box over plastic once you do get the pop 
off valve, and try to make them install it so it doesn't smack the air 
filter on popp-off if it's possible.  Replace the rubber straps with 
heavy duty rubber straps that still give, should the pop off and air vent 
not be enough "give"

We all know how a regular dose of Slick 50 will allow you to run your engine

that has been treated with Slick 50 and it runs fine ).

Well I discovered that if you mix Slick 50 and Duralube and stick it in 
your gas tank, you can then drain all the gasoline out of your gas tank
and it will run forever without gas !

  We have Daytona, Chicago and the rest, and I can't wait for a decent

that compares with a sparc 20/61 and sybase.

Now, down to business, I just had a 1/2 hr. talk with Kurt Pressler, the 
muffler maker on what will make my 3.0sc engine faster.  Apparently, he 
has a $400 modification that will keep my engine ca legal and give a 
conservative 5% power increase.  Next step is going to SSI's and his 
muffler, which will give 20hp increase (he has dyno results for this 
setup), but for off road only.

He also had a lot of good suggestions on how 3.0's [can] beat 3.2 engines 
<g>, and how with the DME in 3.2's, you don't really gain much from 
tweaking the exhaust the way you do with 3.0s.  

Give Kurt a call at 510-684-9437, he also does bay area time trials.

Also, what does a 7:31 ring and pinion do for a transmission that 15" 
195/50 wheels wouldn't do?  I can get a tire diameter of 22.66 with 
195/50*15" wheels, and 23.66 dia. with 16" wheels.  How much and where 
can one obtain 7:31 rings and pinions?  How many hours does it take a

Subject: Update on 914 Battery Tray Replacement


Well, it took a while, but I finally got around to removing my battery tray
and inspecting for rust.  Thanks to all for the suggestions of what areas to
examine.

I believe I am relatively fortunate.  The forward sloping sheetmetal below 
the
battery tray appears to be solid as does longitudinal box and the trailing 
arm
inner mounting point.  I do have some rust on the lower firewall and some 
rust
at the front of the engine shelf at the low point where all the water and 
acid
would run.  As far as I can tell, the rust is limited to these vertical 
areas.  While
not rusted through, the metal is weak enough that I can deflect it with my 
finger.

My thought/hope is that these areas are not structural (yes?/no?), although
some might argue that everything in a 914 contributes to its rigidity :).
Still, I need to at least neutralize the rust, if not cut out the rot and 
weld
in patches.

On a similar note, I also removed the rocker panels and cleaned out all the
caked up dirt.  I found some minor surface rust which I need to remove. 
 While
blowing out dirt and dust with an air hose, I saw dust coming out of the 
drain
holes in the longitudinal box.  Does anybody know if the metal inside the 
box
is painted or otherwise rustproofed?  If not, would it be worth while to do 
this
to a relatively sound 20 year old car?  Some of the undercoating is starting 
to
flake and peel off as well, is the rubberized spray undercoating available 
in
stores any good?

I plan to paint the new battery tray with acid resistant paint and I have 
also
ordered one of those acid absorbing battery mats.

That's a design artifact of the 911 CIS. If you get a backfire, it blows
up the airbox.

Short answer, yes, that's reasonable.

Labor to R & R the airbox is about 4 hours. New box is about $400 if you
get a plastic one, $600 if you get aluminum with integral pop-off valve.
Pop-off valve is another $50, about an hour labor to install.

Probably not. Depends on the size of the hole. It screws up the air metering
like you wouldn't believe.

If you can get some help from someone who's done it before, sure. If this
is a first-time and solo effort, I think it's important enough to get this
right that you'd be better off taking it in. The fact that the car doesn't
start at all may indicate other problems as well. And those little boot gizmos
are *murder* to deal with -- my hands/arms are large enough that I *can* *not*
do this myself with the engine in the car. Something else for you to think
about -- if the air box went, you need to check all the other system seals. 
You *MAY* need to replace them all. I personally would vote for replacing
all the injector seals and the boots while you're at it, unless you can
remember the last time it was done, and it has bee less than 5 years.

It is true that the direction arrows can mean the two different things you
mention.  I have had Yoko A001-Rs which had arrows that said "DRIVE".  I
have also had Yoko AVS U+4s which had arrows that said "ROTATION".  The 
latter were indeed for water channeling.  They were mounted the same
regardless of  drive or brake.  The 1-Rs had to be mounted one way on
the drive wheels and the other way on the braking only wheels.

Sorry I don't know which yours are supposed to be, but maybe a word near
the arrow will help decide.  If no one else on the net knows, you'll
have to consult the tire people.

Hello all,
I'm considering the purchase of a 928, and recently spotted an 1983 928 for
$6,900. or b\o. Upon calling and asking the typical question about the car, the
owner said that everything works fine except after about 10 minutes of driving
the oil pressure light comes on. He seemed to think that the oil pump wasn't
working. I'm going to see the car tonight, and if all looks good I will take it
to a mechanic and have it checked out, but if anyone can answer the following
questions for me I would appreciate it greatly.

1) If its is the oil pump, what is the cost to replace this ?

2) If the car has been driven in this condition what other damage could be
present?

3)  $6900. is pretty cheap for an 83, what are some of the other mechanical
areas I should look out to see if this really is a bargain?

OK, here's my $.02:

For paint care, I prefer the "multi-step" approach where your polish doesn't
contain wax, and your wax doesn't contain polish. Gives more control, the
ability to do spot polishing where abrasion has created fine scratches, and
wax without abrading the surface when you don't need polishing (i.e. most of
the time).

As to brands, I have used Malm's Ultra-Fine polish and Carnauba wax products
for ten years, and although I have tried _many_ other products out on my
daily drivers, I have not found anything which is easier or yields a finer
finish. Malm's also offers a couple of other levels of polish, but since I
have maintained the car since new, it has never needed anything harsher than
the Ultra-Fine.

BTW, my paint is a clear-coat metallic, so its important to me not to damage
or wear through the clear coat layer. So the car is _very_ finely polished,
but there's still that darn factory orange peel (rippled surface) in the
clear coat. I have seen a few p-cars in solid colors which have been
wet-sanded to remove the orange-peel, and they look wonderful.

- ---> My question is, has anyone out there done wet-sanding of a clearcoated
finish? I have been told that the orange peel is all in the clear coat (the
underlying metallic, which is not shiny, is sanded before they apply the
clear coat). Any ideas?

1) That's not the point. Neil Fennessey has a 912 with steel wheels and he
wants to keep it looking original. Gold BBS wheels may not be appreciated
for this application.
 
2) Besides, steel wheels are most definitely NOT unsafe. But they are
heavier and less sexy than wide aluminum wheels. If you had had steel wheels
during your recent curb encounter, they would probably have held air just
as well as forged wheels, and would have been cheaper to replace.
 
3) Steel wheels will cause more damage when dropped onto your engine air
inlet grille. OTOH, they will bounce off curbs better, maybe make nicer
sparks. Take your choice. <g>

Jeff.

I have installed a similar upgrade on my '87 944 with a small improvement in 
performance. The K&N type filter will not show much change by itself but 
these are good filters anyway and I think worth the price if only for the 
improvement in filtration.
I installed a performance chip from Automotion a year or so ago. There is a 
small but noticeable improvement in power that made the chip worthwhile, at 
a sale price (never buy from Automotion unless it is during one of their 
numerous 20/25% off sales). I suspect that the Autothority chip might be 
better - does anyone out there have any experience comparing chips, with 
real dyno results?

The throttle response cam is a "fun" accessory that I first thought a dumb 
idea until I saw a rave write up in 911 & Porsche mag. It increases the rate 
of throttle opening. First impression during normal driving is of higher 
acceleration. Probably because you are opening more throttle than you would 
expect. After a while the response curve seems natural & more "sporting". 
Installation is 5-10 minutes including readjusting the throttle cable.

Give it a try!

the car, and the sunroof has never had problems, being held
at the back by the rear catches and the front by the way it
slides over the air deflector, but without the front catches
the front never seals properly, and some water leaks in when
the car sits in heavy rain.

I live in Australia, and the local price for new catches is

Subject: Re: Famous ListMeister

Ted,

Sorry to disagree with Kurt Pressler, but any gain that can be
had with a 3.0 can be had in equal preportions with a 3.2.

The only way to get significant gains with either engine is
to change a lot of hardware. The cams in both engines are the
same and the 3.2 has, in stock form, a more flexible injection
system. The 3.2 has almost 200cc more capacity and as the old
axiom says, there is no substitute for cubic inches.

If you changed to headers and free flowing exhaust system, you can
gains of around 20 to 25 horsepower on either engine. The only
way to get significant gains is to change the cams to a more
radical profile. The CIS system on the 3.0 cannot handle this
at all. The DME system on the 3.2 is much better and dealing
with cam changes. Still, you need a more flexible system to
get serious power gains.

The way to get the most power is to change the cams, increase
the cubic inches, and change to equal length headers and a free
flow muffler.

By just changing to equal length headers and a free flow muffler,
you can expect a maximum of 205 HP out of a 3.0 and 240 out of
a 3.2. Modest gains to be sure, but better than nothing.

I gleaned most of this information from conversations with Galen
Bieker and Jerry Woods.

About 40 cars where on the way to Stockholm to celebrate a swedish

The information we got from the chairman of Porsche Club Sweden was that
the parade had been a major success. 

The concours winner was a red 924 from Great Britain and I got a look
at it and it was really in mint condition.

One of the more spectacular events on the Parade had been a massive

The value of doing this is marginal. To use them, you need a VERY differnt
set of gear than the usual "add a pound of freon" setup that you have
laying around from the days of cheap flurocarbons... In particular,
you need a pump of particular configuration and a few other odds and 
ends. The unfortunant thing is that this is usually packaged in a $3k
unit that also does recycling of old freon, and a few other things. Plus,
you *WILL* need a license in most places to get buy the machine and even
the 20 lb bottles. License isn't hard -- just a test that most of us could
probably pass off of old partially remembered college chemistry and physics,
but it IS a detail.

There is an article in the August "Excellence" by Bob Poggi about what
all you have to do to convert to a 134a system. It's not that bad. I'd
recommend that everyone do that over trying to sustain an R-12 habit...

(Except this friend of mine in West Bend, IN, who has about 245 cases of

According to Kurt, there was little to improve over the stock 3.2 
muffler.  If there were, it would seem he would want to capitalize on 
this, as there are a lot of 3.2's out there.

Agreed, but the 20% more horsepower in the 3.2 is mainly attributed to 
the DME system over CIS, not the 200cc, which adds little in the way of 
horsepower.

Kurt agrees with the 20 (has dyno results with 3.0 and SSI and his 
muffler), but not on 3.2.

Maybe power out of the engine, but still not in that order.  Power to the 
wheels is a) less weight, (re-read physics book, and simulate effect of 
dropping Oprah on your windshield at Porsche speeds, -- that's the effect 
of SC weight over pre SC weight). b) better intake system, c) more cc's, 
d) muffler to match the gas input system, which on 3.2, factory muffler 
system is already great,

above is my opinion, prove me if I'm wrong.

I agree with Pete here, the sales of electrical cars will not 'take off' in

and development, and the fact that cars get cleaner and leaner burning for 
every year. 

What I find strange is the very low interest in alternative fuels, I had a 
professor in school which (almost) got famous with his 'wood-powder' burning 
engine, it ran on almost stock sawdust! Tha thought was to grow Eucalyptus 
trees! I think car or oil business just bought the patent and buried it! 
What happens on the Methanol or Ethanol section, the South Americans and 
VolskWagen has tons of documentation and experiences with these engines. Oil 
companys are buying every patent that seem to have negative consequences for 
them.

    fine otherwise (no movement or slop in the lateral

    When there is load on the wheel and thus the 1/2 shaft is not
    fully extended, the shaft does not stick at all and moves as
    freely as the driver's side.  I have taken the shaft off and
    pressed the CVs off, but they seem fine (not dry, and no vissible

Dear P-Philes
   Thanks for all the helpful suggestions about the wheel re-chroming.  To
clarify, they are STEEL wheels.  They are heavy, but I don't race the car.
I found this car outside of Atlanta about 10 years ago and that week,
chanced to stroll through a Porsche concours event there.  I couldn't
believe it when I saw a judge dressed in a lab coat going inspecting a
headlight rim with a q-tip.  I vowed then and there NO CONCOURS.  The
chrome wheels accentuate the graceful lines and other chrome trim, remember
there was lots, of the older 901 body.  Whaletails and turbo look-alikes
are best left to others.  I spent time in racing circles 20 years ago (BTW
how did Reeves Calloway do at LeMans?  We ran a Lola T252 Super Vee in '74)
and saw my share back then.  Because it doesn't look like a pocket racer,
but has plenty of chrome, folks know right away that it's an older Porsche.
 I'll have new rims welded on the wheel centers when I put the car into its
annual winter stasis.  
   For Stefan Reitshamer r.e. AC.  I'd suggest going to Chambers Motorcars
on McGrath highway in Somerville.  They are the dealer around here now
and they're only about 15 min. from you / MIT.  Take Vassar out to 3rd
Street, go left on the McGrath highway about 3/4 mile.  Bear right past the
old yellow brick power plant, they're on the right.
   For Steve r.e. future color survey, mine is 1967 912 with a 1972
Dalmation Blue paint job.  I love the color, and get frequent comlements
about it, but not doubt concours judges would not.  So what say I...

Please correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that all wheels Porsche
now puts on street cars are described as pressure cast light alloy, and
no longer as forged alloy wheels.  The last wheels described as forged
were the Design 90.  I remember how disappointed I was seeing the
first C4's come through, new flagship car, with *painted* Design 90
pressure cast wheels.  Perhaps there is no weight/strength/performance
difference (can anyone shed some light?), but I miss the appearance
and tradition of the unpainted, forged wheels: Fuchs five-spoke, Mahle,
dish, and Design 90.  Sniff.

'Philes,

There is this noise which shows up from time to time on my '89 944 (78k miles)
with the following characteristics (when it does show up):

1. Present only when the clutch is engaged.
2. Roughly the same under acceleration, deceleration or coasting. 
3. Does not seem to be affected by turning.
4. Not affected by playing with the hand brake.
5. Frequency is function of wheel (not engine) speed and relatively low
	frequency.
6. Not affected by gear selected.
7. Sounds like a shaft rubbing at one spot on its circumference.
8. Seems to be coming from the rear of the vehicle.

I have checked everything under the car and have not found any loose items
or anything which is obviously rubbing.  The only sound I can induce by
hand which sounds anything like it is when I move the right drive shaft back
and forth transversely.  At this time I'm inclined to think it might be
something worn in one of the CV's.

Anyone out there experience anything like this?  Thanks...

- ----- End Included Message -----


Water is a catalyst for the corrosion of metals. I do not see how you
can avoid an increased risk for corrosion by having your engine operate
in a humid emvironment. Yesterday I was at the shop and saw a cam from
a 356 motor just after it had been removed. The cam lobes had broken
down and there was considerable rust present. MFI units also suffer
from corrosion due to wet fuels. This is a very bad problem with
alcohol containing fuels as alcohol enables the fuel to absorb more
water. Of course the misting you describe would not introduce water
into the fuel system.

Ionic compounds (NaCl is the one we all love to hate during winter) in
water also catalyze the chemical reactions responsible for corrosion.
So CaCl2 and other salts in water will enhance the rate of corrosion to
some degree. Pure water (when it comes to drinking) usually implies the
lack of trace amounts of organic impurities and water that has not been
subjected to cholorination (BTW chlorine is not ionic and reacts qutie
quickly with organic matter and microbes... so chlorinated water will
not enhance corrosion). How ionic (or non-ionic) drinking water is has
to do with its source.

The least reactive water would be distilled water at neutral pH (not
acidic and not basic). Given the alloys present in a 911 I would be
certain the water system I installed was not delivering acidic water.
Since your engine will be injesting huge amounts of water via the
supersatureted atmoshperic air, change the oil/filter very often. Some
of the water will boil out of the oil, but some of the water can not
because it is not chemically free.

One last thing about corrosion... corrosion is a pretty simple chemical
reation. Reaction rates increase with temperature. Your car rusts less
in the winter than in the summer. The time to flush your body work,
suspension and undercarridge with water is in the spring and summer
(the solubility of salt also increases with temperature). Unless you
have a heated garage, very little corrosion occurs when it is below -10
dec C. On the otherhand, trace amoounts of salt at 30 to 35 deg. C in
the summer will be very effective at corroding our German metal.

Sorry to ramble on... but I feel the worst enemy to the long term
viability (besides the infamous previous owner) of our air-cooled
Porsches is corrosion.

Porschephiles!

I have been noticing that my '87 924S revs a bit sluggish when fully warm,
almost like it has a "flat spot" .  This behavior seems most noticable at
partial throttle.  When it is cold it revs great.  What gives?  I was
thinking maybe it was the O2 sensor, but at $180 a pop I figured I'd get
some collective wisdom!

Also I recently had my car emission tested, it past the HC std but failed
the CO std of 1% giving a reading of 3%.  This is a bit baffling since I
just had the CO adjusted by the dealership.  Is my catalytic convertor on
it's way out (over 100,000miles) or is it something I can cure with some
new plugs and a air filter.  Is it possible that this could be another
sign that my O2 sensor is malfuntioning.

Thanks in advance!

there has been a change in ownership?  Darn, I should have verified my

In addition, I don't believe the fellow at the BP station was ever

I think I missed something here. I bought a 25 (could be 20) pound bottle
of R-12 about 2 years ago when the excitement started, for about $40, if
I recollect. I have used it to refill my systems, without significant
extra hardware. I have a gauge set, which includes a convenient set
of filling valves, but I believe that I could have done the same thing
with just a hose, of the sort which comes with the "1 pound kits".
The 25# tank has the same standard flare fitting as the Schraeder (sic?)
valves in the car, which mate to the standard hose fittings. To use
the bigger bottle you need to pay attention to the same details as when
using little cans (bleed out air before filling, put the can in warm
water to accelerate filling, fill to the low pressure side, etc) and you
need a way to tell it is full (i.e. a sight glass), but the process seems
essentially the same.

What am I doing wrong (or more specifically, what does the $3K unit
do)?

By the way, I don't know about the desirability of buying a 25# bottle
now. I don't know what the price is now, and I don't know if new
licensing procedures are in place now (there weren't any in NJ 2 years
ago- I just walked into Pep Boys and bought it).

driven by his son, and several other of us 356 racers.  Also a good 
collection of 911's and 914's.  Wade Carter's are especially fast.

I haven't seen the entry list, yet, but in past years I've seen Pete 
Lovely's 59 Testarossa, a Gulf 917, Bruce McCaw's 300SL, a great 
collection of old Can Am cars and even a few F1.  Also Allards, Masers, 
Lotuses, Cobras, etc.

Even the pits are fun.  Where else will you see two Lamborghini LM002 tow 
vehicles.  Last year we gave over $80K to Children's Hospital, so you can

I disagree.  I think electric cars will take off near 2001.  Reason is 
that 3rd generation prototypes by GM, etc. are already drivable (0 to 60

Secondly, all car makers selling cars in US will be required to make 2% 
of their cars produce no smog by '98 and 10% in 2000.  

My prediction is by 2010, 10% of car sales will be electric.

Subject: Re: 911 CV joints

Re: Steve's sticking shafts:
  There will always be some "sticking" due to the semi-sealed nature of the CV
boot - it's got to move either air or grease around to make up for the axial
movement of the shaft, but I assume your having some sort of binding action
in the CV joint.

When you examined your current joints, did you disassemble them?  That's really
the only way you can check for ridges in the CV casing.  At the regular
driving geometry the ball bearing will only move in a limited interval along
their grooves in the casing - when you jack up the car you might be moving
them out of their normal interval and they could be catching on a ridge caused
by their normal wear.

  Another thing that comes to mind is that maybe you have a not-quite-right
kind of CV joint: I think for 70-71, where the cars still had the 901
transmission but the larger driveshafts (with M10 bolts), the CV joints are
wider than the 72-on CV joints.  The bolts are also longer...I know because
I happen to have gotten a used driveshaft with one of the wider CV joints but
with the old bolts that barely thread into the transmission flange.  Perhaps
you have had a joint replaced with the newer variety at some point in
your Porsche's life?  This might screw up the geometry and cause the binding -
just a guess.

PS when you have the joints off, go ahead and replace the boots and grease.

particle the more is removed. One of the products on display (the display

Subject: Electric Porsches

Hi, Ed.
 
The Lohner-Porsche car was electric. During WWI Porsche designed an
electric-powered gun train for the Austrian army, with wheel hub motors. It
could haul artillery around tight switchbacks in the Tyrolean Alps, where
Austria was fighting Italy.
 
The Tiger tank though had a conventional (Maybach) engine driving the
treads by conventional means. Porsche's design for the Tiger was rejected by
the army, as its air-cooled engine driving electric motors or hydraulic
transmissions was too complicated and would have taken too long to develop.
Henschel's design was the winner. Some Tigers did have a Porsche-designed
turret (the cylindrical shaped turret, not the tub-shaped one) made by Krupp
for their rejected design. One source I have says that a very small number
of the 90 Porsche-designed Tigers originally ordered were built.
 
Because the Tiger (P), as the Porsche design was known, had such development
problems, there are photos of it undergoing trials with only the electrical
equipment installed in the hull, and some huge cables running to another
Type 100 hull which worked as a generator.
 
Porsche's tank destroyer on a Tiger chassis, the Type P100, was nicknamed
Ferdinand (official designation Elefant) and actually saw front-line service.
Ninety were built. Engines were two Maybach 60 degree V12 gasoline engines
with combined output of 530 hp at 3000 rpm, driving one electric generator
and two electric motors.
 
Porsche's original idea of a pair of air-cooled V10 gas engines driving
electric generators never flew in the P100.
 
Later Porsche designed an X-16 engine to replace the V10; that wasn't bought
either, as peace broke out. X-16: four cylinders in each bank, like two
narrow V8s lying on their sides with a common crankcase.
 
Porsche suspension (torsion bars, interleaved road wheels) was used for the
Ferdinand, the Tiger, and other tank designs.
 
Two other Porsche designs, the superheavy Maus and E100, are in the history
books as biggest tank ever designed, sort of a land battleship. They didn't
go into production either.
 
More recently, Porsche contributed to the design of the German standard
tank, the Leopard. While I worked in Weissach I would occasionally see a Leo
II being loaded onto the train at the little terminal in town. (It's the
same rail line you see in the current TV commercial, with the test driver
reading his paper on his way to work; that single orange and blue car is I
think the only piece of rolling stock the railway uses, and Weissach is the
end of the line). Next to the racing department was a junkyard with a
Leopard or two in it. More recently, Porsche developed a light air-drop
vehicle (I hesitate to call it a tank) powered by an Audi 5-cylinder car
engine. I was showing some Washington types around Weissach and part
of the dog and pony show was a demo of this thing.
 
Now do we see how the Porsche Type 917 race car was designed? <g>

	of cleaning and leaves a nice waxy finish on the leather after you 
	polish it out. Takes a little while to apply, but sure beats every
	thing else I've tried!

	On other cleaners, I've become a convert to Meguirs cleaning and
	wax products over the years, I like the control that the various
	polishing products give you, ie, fine cut, finishing etc.

	On color sanding, the late (mine's an '87) clear coat finishes,
	there seems to be a lot of clear on top, I've color sanded out some
	pretty deep scratches (dog on hood!) with 1000 & 1500 grit wet sand
	and polished it out, and not hit any of the color.

	Wheels, mine are polished aluminum, beware of harsh detergents,
	as the caustic will etch the aluminum! I just use the Meguirs
	Liquid Car Wash solution left over from washing the car, and 
	scrub a bit with the old Car Mit, rinse immediately and Voila 
	they're clean! Got to do it every week though.

	There, that's my two cents.

Steel is more durable and less expensive than cast alloy in wheels. Bent 
steel wheels can usually be repaired more easily. At least that is what the 
taxi drivers in NYC say. It cost about $5-7 to bend back the usual pothole

P.S.  Re: 944 Turbo mods - be careful who you give your money to.  Back in 
January, 1990, I was at a local racetrack with the owners of identical year 
944 Turbo S'.  Both had been recently tuned up, but one had a performance 
chip and wastegate mods done to it...a couple of $K worth of parts and 
labour.  Both cars seemed equal in speed....close enough so that the owners 
had a "drag race".  The cars consistently "tied" after a number of attempts.  
Driver differences?  I doubt it.  They swapped cars too with the same 
results.

Whatever you decide to do, make sure you get some sort of guarantee in

"Apple Leather Care" is also a good product that is a little less heavy.

Yes.  It's the leather treatment from Connolly Brothers, who have
a unique leather tanning method.  It's somewhat different from
the leather used on German sedans; I'm not sure what Porsche uses
for their seating surface.  

You won't hurt anything by using the Hide Food on a 928.  (The
dependency is the other way round; Hide Food has some special
emollients that are designed to work specifically with the tanning
procedures that the Connollys use to get their butter-soft leather
as used in Jags, Rolls-Royces, and Ferraris.)  

Other good leather treatments are Lexol, which comes in a cleaner
and a conditioner.  The cleaner (basically thinned-down saddle
soap with some additives) works very well, taking off dark scuff
marks from steering-wheel covers and the like.  The conditioner
helps keep the leather fibers from drying out, which is the main
failure mode of leather surfaces.

If your 928's seats are dirty, try the Lexol cleaner first.  I
apply it with a damp sponge, as per the label's instructions,
wiping it in gently to lift off surface dirt.  Then follow up
with the Hide Food, which is a conditioner designed to keep
the leather soft, supple, and smelling nice.

It's also worth pointing out that leather can be maintained, or
it can be replaced, but it's very tough to refinish leather after
the initial cracking and drying has begun.  Best to use a leather
dressing regularly, especially if you live in a hot climate with
lots of UV exposure, or if you have a red interior, as red tends
to reflect the low-energy light and absorb the high-energy end 
of the spectrum.  This, of course, is why red cars fade so much
more quickly than blue cars.

Subject: Re: Chroming 912 wheels

The question arises with respect to pressure-cast wheels:

~ (can anyone shed some light?),

Not on wheels, but I can talk about pistons.  For the past,
oh, ten years or so, piston technology has developed what I
first heard referred to as "squeeze-cast."  The problem was
that forged pistons were stronger, but ran looser clearances
due to (warning: potentially incomplete memory ahead) the
metallurgical changes that occur when you forge metal.  (The
memory in question is of a description from a metallurgist,
who explained that forging aligns the latticework inside the
metal in such a way that it's both stronger and also more
compact, and this changes its coefficient of expansion, so
he surmised -- and again, the surmise is several years old,
so any professional metallurgical engineers are welcome to
respond -- that forged pistons had to run greater clearances
because they had a greater coefficient of expansion than cast
pistons of the same metal.)

The squeeze-cast pistons, however, were made by pouring molten
aluminum into the molds and then applying a fairly significant
pressure while the metal was still partially liquid.  This was
said to have most of the benefits of forged pistons, while still
providing tighter running clearances which would reduce oil
blow-by (and, for street-driven vehicles, emissions).  In the
mid-80s, squeeze-cast pistons were the hot ticket for performance
street motors, where you wanted stronger than stock but couldn't
put up with either the oil consumption or with the hit at smog
check time.

Why I suspect the technologies (and to some extent, the benefits)
are the same is of course that one of the wheel companies you name,
Mahle, is also well known for its forged racing pistons.

And not to throw *too* big a monkey wrench into the chroming debate,
but if you are having wheels chromed, be sure to ask about hydrogen
embrittlement.  Vintage race cars that have wire wheels typically
do not run chromed spokes because the chroming process uses hydrogen
in some compound (I can't recall what it is -- a hydroxyl?) that
causes the surface of the steel to become brittle.  On a thin
metal spoke such as you're likely to find in a typical Fifties-era
wire-wheel-equipped car, this can be serious; I suspect that the
sheer mass of metal in a 912 rim would mitigate the effects somewhat,
but if you have any cracks in the rim you're probably introducing
a potential failure unless they're magnafluxed and filled first.

How do you figure this? Just adding a DME system to your '78
3.0 engine is not going to give you over 207 to 217 HP. The

make the difference along with the DME system.

On a 3.2, if you change to 1.75" 911SCRS-style equal length headers
and add a muffler system with near equal length secondaries, you will
see increases in HP to the 240HP range. If you put SSIs and Kurt's
muffler on your '78 3.0, you would have 200HP according to his
dyno results. These numbers do not imply to me that a '78 3.0 can
be made more powerful than a 3.2 when similar modifications are made.

What is your point here? Power to the wheels has nothing to do with
how much your cars weighs. Part of how well you car can use that
power is a function of how much the car weighs. You seem to forget
that there is more to an exhaust system than the damn muffler!!
The 3.2 factory muffler may be better than the 3.0 muffler; like

output. If it was, everyne would be bolting them to their 3.0 liter
engines.

The H-4's in 90w/100w configuration just isn't enough for night

1. Any suggestions for a bracket/mount for mounting the lights to

   the lights to mount to that could then be mounted to something
   nice and solid up front.

2. It looks like there is a place for another switch on the dash

   might be a driving light switch for the Euro. models.  Am I right?
   If yes, is there any way to get one of these (and the plug that
   goes to the backside of the switch)?  I'll use a second fog light
   switch if I have to, but I would like one that's different from

Softback, the SC seems stiff.  Of course the 912, even though it's restored( 
to 99 point driver specs) it has 250k on it so maybe the trannys broken in by 
now.  Should I be so lucky that the SC just needs a few thousand more shifts 
to smooth it out or is there a "problem"?  Is there a secret goo for the 
tranny that makes them synchros slide and mesh easier or do I need to pump 
more iron with the shifting arm?  Is that it? Is this a real mans car?(My 
vettes always shifted easy...) 
 
If it has been a problem for SC's, what's the projected wallet drain? 
 
Also, while I've got your attention, does anyone have or know where I can get

Hide Food is made by the Conolly Brothers, suppliers of leather to
such companies as Rolls Royce, Ferrari, Aston Martin, etc. Hide Food
IS NOT a cleaner, it is a conditioner. CB makes a special soap for

Well, this must be a small leak somewhere. When the water pump needed
replacement and it was leaking coolant, I could definitely smell that 
when it dripped someplace hot. This does not smell like coolant.

This smell seems to have appeared after an oil change. I know there is 
a small seep around the cam housing -- there is no leak anywhere enough
to drip. Perhaps this is it. I suspect it also could be anywhere. After
all as soon as anything seeps out around a hot part it will vaporize.

I know nothing about chips (unless found in a pasture), but I would be
cautious about relying on "real dyno results," especially from a vendor. 

I once bought a race engine complete with a dyno sheet the builder sent to
backup his horsepower claim. It was built and dyno'ed in Knoxville, Tenn.
The engine ran OK, but not quite up my expectations. The dyno sheet showed
an unusually high humidity the day of the test, and then I learned how
humidity is factored in the equation to produce the horsepower rating. It's
like an M-1 pencil (if you've ever qualified on the firing range). If you
want more HP, just use more humidity.

It might very well be from the UK. As in fact a lot of the best quality car

bikes, and seem to take care of any brand from the A30's to the (in my eyes 
dull) sixties Vauxhalls.

As perhaps most of you know, the British cars were known for their beautiful 
nice interiors, walnut dashes and leather seats. 

Bottom line, Hide-Food is *very* well recommended, as most UK car care products.

Hi, Kevin.
 
Yes, current Porsche wheels are low-pressure cast alloy. They're lighter,
with lower rotational inertia. Porsche claims that the stock 911 wheels save
6 kg per car. Ride comfort is also improved by the reduction in unsprung
weight. The air openings are bigger so brake cooling is improved; the
old design had an open cross section of 388 mm^2 while the new ones have 475
mm^2 per wheel. (Source: German technical magazines: Automobiltechnische

Subject: Electric cars, alternate fuels

Hi, Trond.
 
Engines burning sawdust or using charcoal to generate CO (which is
combustible: 2CO + O2 -> 2CO2) is not a new idea. Lots of countries used it
during WW2, particulary occupied Europe, as there wasn't enough fuel to go
around anyway. I have a curious book here about something called the
"Pegasus powerplant." Sort of a hippie do-it-yourself version of what the
Germans called a "Holzgasgenerator" -- wood gas generator. Co-author is a
Dane, Niels Skov; preface mentions Carlo Thomsen and Aage Kjellerup. Do you
know any of these?
 
There are problems with methanol and ethanol fuels. Brazil tried to force
ethanol made from sugar cane down the consumers' throats. It worked OK
for a while, almost all Brazilian-built cars used the stuff, then suddenly
the sugar price went up and all the farmers sold it overseas instead of
turning it into fuel. I don't think the government could subsidize it enough
to make fuel production profitable. So now Brazil is back to making
gasoline-powered cars, and importing foreign oil, and worsening their
balance of payments. (I presume sugar exports didn't help much).
 
The current American fascination for blending methanol and similar stuff
with pump gas is largely due to a very powerful lobby, the distillers! ("If
the public won't drink the stuff, maybe we can get their cars to do it for
them...")
 
My master's thesis was testing alcohol-diesel fuel and water-diesel fuel
emulsions to improve emissions. Results of thesis experiments: these ideas
don't work.

Pardon me...but what is concidered high powered?

Would 310 HP fall in there?  I know of one particular car with this
setup that has been driven for years with an RSR on-off clutch.  The
forces translated by the clutch were enough to eventuallt break the
crank at the flywheel end, but the R&P are still going.
(Harry Hall's "Big Bird", owned by the shapps and now somewhere in chicago.)

I've got a 7:31 in my SC3.4, and ... granted, it's only in the 250-275
HP range, have not had problems.

Other opinions would be appreciated.

I am, of course, speaking from relative ignorance here, since I am
still on the 1st half of  my bottle, but I don't understand what causes
the problem. Freon is stored as a liquid in the bottle, so the pressure
in the bottle should remain at the vapor pressure of R-12 until all
of the liquid evaporates. If the differential pressure is adequate to
create flow when the bottle is full, it should still do the same thing
when the bottle is close to empty (but still contains liquid). Typically,
the differential pressure is generated by the compressor, which causes
a low side pressure which is lower than the vapor pressure of R-12 at
ambient temperature, causing flow from the bottle. If that is not enough
flow, gentle heating of the bottle (raising the vapor pressure) should
get things moving, I would expect, more easily than creating differential
pressure with height.

I realized after I posted yesterday that the two common small bottle
sizes are 15 and 30 pounds, and I have a 15, which in fact I think I
could relativley easily hold up in the air as I fiddled with gauges,
but I'm still confused about the theory.

mr darling is correct. do not linger in the vicinity of this trash pile.

the reason for this is the following:

a) it will take at least 8 hours of skilled labor (and i'd guess closer to 12)
	to put a new oil pump in a 928.

b) if this motor has an oil pressure problem, the camshaft 'bearings', 
which are
	surfaces machined directly into the aluminium alloy camshaft housings,
	are either already shot (possibly the cause of the problem), or they
	will be shot very soon.

c) if the block is trashed (a distinct possibility) a new block and pistons
	for the 2 valve 928's costs $5500.

again, i say, sprint from the vicinity of this disaster! if you want a 
'79 to '82 928,
you should be able to a *real nice* one for about 8 to 10K.

Subject: re: freon availability


     To buy freon in containers less than 20lbs, you must be licensed. 
   However, for some really strange reason, it is possible to buy 
   BIGGER containers without the license, i.e. you can walk in off the
   street to most auto parts stores and buy a 30lb cannister of freon
   (about $275, $200 of which is tax). The logic seems to be that the 
   average guy who wants to buy a can is less likely to reclaim his freon
   than the guy who is buying large amounts (presumably for commercial)
   reasons and is somehow more of a threat to melting the icecaps...
   
    (I think) after 1995, it is illegal to vent freon. Unless you have
   freon reclamation equipment (the $3k job) you can be fined up to 
   $10k, and (just like the Sargent Stadenko days) anyone who tips you
   off can receive a reward. So even if you hoard freon it is illegal
   to install it unless you are licensed.
     Freon itself won't be illegal, but any freon needed will have to come
   from New-Old-Stock and from recycling what you had left in your car 
   (which of course was nothing). Makers of freon are already stopping 
   production, which is predicting a shortage; in typical goofy government
   fashion (that should have just stopped new car production with freon, 
   to phase it out) the EPA has gone back and asked freon manufacturers to
   continue production longer, and has actually suggested that car shops buy 
   and wharehouse it....                     

    My questions to anyone who knows;
      1. I've heard that R-12 and R134 are worse than incompatible, that
         in fact if combined in any amount they become corrosive. Is this
         true ? Can an R-12 system be flushed to any degree or does every
         hose, evaporator, condenser, etc have to be replaced ?
      2. Is R-22 not deplete the ozone ? If so, why haven't the feds gone
         after it ? If so, how long do we have (should I move north) ?
      3. How well does R134 cool compared to R-12 (i.e., if my 911 was 
         bad before what prayer is there w/R134) ? Anybody out there
         have a car with R134 ?

     From what little I know, ozone depletion from freon is a gnat to
   the elephants of manure-made methane, volcanoes, and release of chlorine
   (don't flame me, I'm not a Chem E) from the oceans. But if the the whole
   earth is going to get hot, gad-darn-it at least I want to have working  
   A.C. in my old cars; and if a 20 year supply of freon is $1000 cheaper
   than converting to a poorer-performing substitute, as the the song goes, 
   I'll just smile and wave (sitting here on my sack of seeds...)

I recall Bruce Anderson reporting on performance chips in Excellence a

unimpressive.  Bruce, are you listening?

My wife's 89 has the Autothority chip (came with the car at purchase
last year) as well as the original.  I (think I) detect a very small torque
improvement at lower RPM's over my 88, but that may be due to the

Firstly, our background. We are a company based in England which I have 
brought to America to enter the American market as the cars and gas is 
different. We do a lot of work for Porsche GB and the last 25 944s were 
sold with SUPERCHIPS fitted from the distributor. We got a genuine 20 HP 
gain and they claimed 25 HP. We do most of the Porsche turbo cup cars in 
England and know these cars inside out as we retune a different one just 
about every week. If a guy does not win, his car is back on the dyno!!!

There are 2 basic engine specs for the 944 Turbo, the 220 HP car which we 
tune to 286 HP and the 250 HP which we tune to 315 HP. Both cars have the 
same maximum boost limit of 14.7 PSI but the weak point with these cars 
lies not the injection system but the head gasket. If you are changing 
your head gasket we do have some hand made stainless steel ones but they 
cost $350!! They will allow you to run to the limit of the injectors at 17 
PSI boost and that gives you about another 30 HP. All of these figures 
are deliberatley non specific because each car develops different power 
levels and to offer a specific power output is not a wise thing to do as 
the factory car may be a little down on power to start with, and then we 
get complaints!!!

We supply a valve to adjust the boost pressure from under the hood 
together with the chips. You get a boost control chip and a fuel/ignition 
chip in the kit and it costs $400. You can try it for a week and return 
it for a refund if not happy and it has a 12 month warranty. If you want 
the rev limit moving, we can set it where you want, but it is not usual 
to move it more than 10% on the turbo as the torque curve is going down 
rapidly when the boost limit is reached.

Hope it answers the questions, but I do have data sheets if you want them 
just give me an address or fax number

I've had a strange smell in my '86 944, shortly after startup, 
recently, also.  I've tracked it down to powersteering fluild on
the exhaust manifold.  After a little while, the smell goes away.

In my case, the leak isn't bad (haven't measured a fluid drop yet)
but I still have to track down where the leak is - I believe it's
the hoses.

Hope this helps,

Subject: More on Freon

I got many replies to my Freon question, so I think I'll pass along the info I
now have:

YES, you can buy Freon in bulk for a very good price. The problems are:

	The bulk can weighs > 200lbs -- which is daunting (at least for me)

	You need special equipment to get this into your car.

SO, for the shadetree mechanic such as myself this seems like it isn't worth
it. What would I do with a 100+ year supply of Freon anyway? 

I had thought that the 'larger can' maybe was 20lb and that you could put it
directly into the A/C, and then you could offer the service easily to your
friends, etc. NOT.

To all that responded,
Thanks for all the information that you provided me. I've decided to "run" not
walk away from this one. 

After seeing the car my decision was easier to make, the exterior looked good
but, the interior showed major neglect. It looked like the owner could have
cared less about minor maintenance not to metion major maintenance. 

When I asked to take it for a test ride he refused saying that he didn't want
to damage the car (oil problem). So now here I was looking at a car I couldn't
even test drive, what was this guy thinking ? At this point he did agree to
start it up, and on top of everythig eles this car  sounded real rough
(transmission noise , poor idle). So, at this point I bid my farewells and ran
out of there as fast as my legs could take me.

Once again thanks for all the responses to my question and I will continue my

To whom this may concern:

       Thanks to all who responded to my smoking SC worries, as many of you 
pointed out, I over filled my oil and that was part of the porblem, the other 
was that my car was running way too rich due to a piston that was stuck open in 
the fuel mixture unit (fuel distributor ?)...anyways, too much gas was going in 
and hence the white smoke.  After $700+ (I got a whole bunch of other work done 
too), I can now enjoy my SC again !.

        A special thanks to Mil Milliman for turning me onto Charles Anselmo of 
Guaranteed imports in Santa Cruz, I would like to add this shop to the list of 
GREAT shops...Charles was very knowledgeable about my SC and took about 2 hours 
answering all the questions I had..If any P-car owners out there in netland 
lives in Santa Cruz and needs their car worked on, try Guranteed import

love the cars they work on..).


        One question, the 4 cylinder engine in a 912, Is it the same as a VW 
engine ?, I know of a 912 with a rebuilt engine (less the 10,000 miles) on it.

Hey all,

After making a number of adjustments to an 87 944S I just bought (new
clutch, tires, all new fluids, cam/balance shaft belts, oil/fuel/air
filters) and friend of mine suggested that I reset the 'computer
parameters' by disconnecting the negative connection to the battery for
a few minutes and then reconnecting it.  I've never heard of such a
thing - does his advice have any merit to it?

His reasoning is that the parameters have been set to the old
conditions of the car, and with the changes I made the best way
for the car to adjust is to do this.

FWIW, Syntex is a large pharmaceutical company located in Palo Alto.
Made a fortune in birth control pills and, most recently, a pain killer
which is now for sale over the counter under such names as Aleve
(I think Proctor & Gamble distributes it).  Syntex was recently bought
by some $multi-billion European drug co.

Castrol makes a synthetic motor oil known as Syntec.  I think it's
pretty good in the crankcase; less effective in the bottle.

Subject: 944S2 questions


Hello Porschephiles;

Help!!  I am still hunting for my first Porsche (a 944) which has turned into 
quite a learning experience.  After looking at an '89 951 with 37K miles on it 
and no maintenance history, I have now broadened my scope to look at S2  
variants.  Of the two I have looked at in the Washington D.C. area, one was an 
'89 S2 with only 24K miles while the other was a '90 S2 with 70K miles.  The 
'89 has only been driven about 6K miles in the last two years with no 
maintenance performed since the 18K mile mark.  The '90 S2, despite its high 
miles, has been very well maintained over its 4 year history.  Based on this, I 
pose the following questions:

1.  How does long periods of little use affect the 944S2?  Are there certain  
    areas I should look at carefully because of its limited use?

2.  Should I avoid the '90 S2 due to its high mileage (but good price)?  The  
    ACURA dealer selling the car is offering an extended warranty from HONDA.

3.  In general, will a well maintained, high mileage Porsche be more reliable  
    than a poorly maintained, low mileage Porsche?

4.  Is the NADA Used Car GUIDE an accurate valuation of used Porsche prices?  I  
    have never bought a used car before, but the dealers in the Washington DC  
    area want much more than average retail listed in the book.  Yet try to  
    trade them your car and they pull out a Black Book with much lower prices  
    than NADA trade-in values.

Any thoughts, comments or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.  Being 
a novice Porsche hunter is both fun and frustrating at the same time.  Please 
reply directly to me unless you feel your response would benefit the entire 
list.  Thanks in advance.

Unfortunately, electric cars produce smog.  Unless, of course,

while I was out sick last week.

Now you may be on to something here.

In my mind, the initial way electric cars will be practical is for
commuting (particularly if you can find a plug at work... ;-)

Frankly, I just can't see spending what I did on my 911 for the 
performance of a '70 pinto and half the range.

On the other hand, I wonder, when the first internal combustion 
vehicles were sold, how many people used just these arguments
to show how they'd never replace the horse.  Food for thought.

The other problem we currently have is that electric cars tend 
to be modified internal combustion cars.  What really needs to 
be done is a ground up redesign and rethink.

Some thoughts:

      Composite structure

      Integrate battery with chassis

      Spartan, more like motorcycle than car

I have had a similar problem with the power steering fluid. After tightening 
the hose clamps the problem reduced but there is still a very small leak. 
The hoses stay wet and may need replacing.  Currently experiencing a similar 
odor issue with a very small engine oil leak onto the exhaust at the back of 
the engine. Not really losing much oil but there is burn-off when first 
starting in the morning - alarming at first to see a small cloud of smoke 
coming from the engine bay! Not a big inconvenience but I need to get this

AutoThority now offers a package including a chip, mass air flow sensor, and 
air filter.  I read this in the Summer 1994 EuroSport Car magazine.  They 
give some pretty impressive numbers for an 88-89 Turbo S: 320hp, 338 lbs-ft 
torque, 0-60 in 5.35s and 1/4 mile in 12.99s.  The complete package costs 
$1999.

But what about the extra pressure in the cylinders?  How do you ensure that 
the boost is reasonable and will not result in a blown head gasket?  What 
about the driveline, can it take the extra power?

'The new Porsche 220 (or 110 ;)'

Made by composite materials. Lotsa hours in the Wind tunnel. The overall 
weight is kept to a minimum. 

The battery package is standardized,  you can go to the hybrid gas-el 
station and have a new package slipped in whenever you're low on amp. 

The brake system is based with generators, so that every time you break you 
have energy going into the batteries. Solar cells on the roof.

Small auxilliary 4-cycle light alloy backup engine.(Briggs and Stratton????)

what more?

Tuning will be no problem, but this is where your mileage may vary.........!

I think all Pete is trying to say here is that a 7:31 R&P is going to be 
weaker than a 8:31.  The fewer the number of teeth on a pinion gear, the
higher the load on each tooth (as the gears are meshing, each individual
tooth is required to carry a greater percentage of the load).  I learned this
the hard way from my other automotive vice - 4 wheeling.  My '83 Toyota
4WD had 5.29:1 gears in it (7:37 in pcar speak).  7 pinion gear teeth aren't
many and one of mine broke as a consequence.

Hey,

I have a quick, stupid question.  Last night I replaced the "front
rubber smile" on my car.  When I put the thing back together, I
noticed the left front turn signal wasn't working (it was before).
I think I may have inadvertently disconnected the turn signal 
where it plugs in.  The problem is I'm not exactly sure where
this is (I just removed the turn signal from the bumper to take
the bumper off).
 
1.  Can someone tell me where the turn signal plugs in?
and,
2.  Can I get to it without removing the bumper again?

BTW, I do plan to check the bulb before I start taking things apart
again, but I removed the lens last night and I have no reason to
suspect a problem at the light itself.

A direct reply would be nice as I'm on the digest.

Thanks in advance!!

Sean, Scott, Eric, Jim:

The 6th Annual Pacific NW Historics will be held at Seattle International 
Raceways on both Saturday and Sunday.  Practice will start about 9AM with 
racing til about 4:30 or 5.  You can get to SIR by exiting Interstate 5 
at exit 142 and heading East on Hiway 18 past Auburn and over the Green 
River Bridge.  At the top of the hill SIR is on the right.  There is a 
light at the intersection.  From I 90 east take exit 17 (Issaquah), turn 
right 
at the bottom of the off ramp, going through Issaquah.  Keep going down 
the Issaquah Hobart Road about 10 miles, turn onto Hiway 18 west.  SIR is 
about 7 or 8 miles on the left.  (Mileages are very approximate).  Cost 
is $10 per day, $15 for two.  If you were in one of the corrals last year 
it was only $5.  I'm presuming there is a Porsche corral because there 
was one last year, but I don't know for sure.

There is a recorded message at 206.389.5200.  I listened to it last nite 
and it doesn't tell you much.  Pressing 3 gives the race info.

I'll be off next week so won't be reading Porschephiles.  Something about

Subject: Carrera RS in Excellence

I just finished reading the new issue of Excellence. This month issue is a very 
good one including an article on a concours restorer "artist" working on a 74 
911 Carrera RS. The finished product of his one year worth of work was a 
pristine beautiful fly yellow sample of a sports car. He is going to enter it 
in to the famous Manhattan concours and hope to win the big trophy. Finally, 
the car will probably end up being sold to some car collector to be trucked 
around to other contests or maybe displayed in his/her living room as immobile 
objet d'art. 

Now, I know that everybody's interest in these fine cars is different and I am 
not trying to slam anyone here. It is just that if I were that perfect 911 RS 
sample, I would be very unhappy a car. I would be begging my owner to please 
take me out to some back road like highway 25 in California and to please drive 
the hell of me. Drift my four wheels in these tight turns, floor my gas pedal 
after the apexes, and countersteer my steering wheels when I try to snap back 
with my well known heavy rear end. How can I be happy as a sports car when all 
my owner does is to wash me and keep me clean and not even let my wheels touch 
the pavement when I am being transported from point A to point B?


Well, you may notice by now, I am not a collector of cars, I am a driver of 
high performance automobiles. It just makes me semi sick to see all those 
beautiful sports cars not driven. Well, life is not perfect afterall.

To all those beautiful sports cars suffering the fate of immobile art objects, 
may you live out the rest of your days in bliss and may you reincarnate into 
other sports cars with other owner-drivers who will treat you properly in your 
next sports car life. And if several of you reincarnate in my garage, I promise 
to insure you, wash you, wax you, and to drive each and everyone of you twice a 
week.

history.

  I went through this same thought process looking for my first Porsche
  (also a 944).  My purchase odyssey lasted two years, more from indecision
  than anything else.  However, the results have been very satisfying.
  I'll explain:

  The reliability of any machine can be charted on an age reliability curve
  that, for a car, typically starts with infant mortality (a high failure
  rate when new) and becomes random for the rest of the machine's service
  life.  Obviously, different parts of a car have different reliability
  curves.  A water pump repair has a failure rate curve that starts high
  (infant mortality), steady's out (random), and then increases with age
  (wearout).  This curve looks like the cross section of a boat hull.
  Meanwhile, the body sheet metal will start low (no infant mortality) and
  gradually increase due to corrosion (wearout) - a steady slope curve.  If
  you think about these three failure concepts (infant mortality, random,
  and wearout) you can begin to understand how your new p-car will live.

  Now, match up this understanding with the types of maintenance that can
  be performed - corrective, preventive and alterative.  Corrective
  maintenance restores the failed condition by correcting the failure mode.
  Preventive maintenance prevents failure conditions by correcting cause of
  failure (this is why changing oil is a good idea).  Finally, alterative
  maintenance prevents failure by changing/eliminating the cause of failure
  (i.e. upgrade that failed water pump or motor mount with the latest
  redesigned replacement part to lengthen the service interval (or chance
  of failure)).  P-cars are great because their excellent design and
  performance is sustainable with preventive maintenance.  A problem with
  preventive maintenance is it can restart the infant mortality - random -
  wearout clock on the drivetrain.  An example of this is a simple
  replacement of a worn coolant hose may be followed by the water pump or
  coolant expansion tank failing suddenly due to the new system conditions
  (change in pressure).

  If these concepts make sense, then the answer's easy:  There is not a
  right answer.  P-car enthusiasts often say: buy the latest model year car
  of the type you like that you can afford.  This makes sense because the
  maintenance equation is -likely- stacked in your favor using this
  guideline.  However, the two cars you describe offer trade-offs:  The low
  mileage car (presumably more $) has sat for a while, leading to increased
  randomness of the failures (the car wasn't designed to sit, causing seals
  and gaskets to shrink, and hoses/belts to dry up.  The low mileage car is
  also still in the infant mortality->randomness phase of its overall life.
  The higher mileage car has been operated more, but if serviced correctly
  (preventive/corrective/alterative) it is as reliable as new - or better!
  - and costs less.

  I looked at 944's a couple of years ago ranging from 86-89  ($8,000 to
  $21,000).  I didn't consider S2's cause there were very few available and
  were at a premium.  Porsche's are interesting because I've encountered a
  lot of low mileage cars that were in desperate condition inside and out.
  After looking at fifteen or so, I came across an 88 that was in
  unbelievably good condition appearance-wise.  A pre-purchase inspection,
  a call to the original dealer for service records, and $11,000 later it
  was mine.  It was half the cost of a car I looked at a few months before
  and in better condition.

  This car had 78K miles on it.  It needed each of the notorious 944
  repairs (motor mounts, water pump, timing belt) over the last 15K miles
  since (1.5 years).  But, I knew it would.  It had brand new tires (big
  expense).  I put a Koni sport suspension in it and re-aligned it.  I
  drive it daily.

  So, a few questions to ask yourself:  Which one do you like better?
  Which one is in better appearance condition (often an indicator of care)?
  Any service records for either (I'd take a motor mounted, water pumped,
  timing belted, oil-cooler sealed 79k car any day over 20k miles - all
  other factors considered equal)  Next, take it for an independent
  pre-purchase inspection.  Evaluate the items that need corrective,
  preventive, alterative maintenance as indicated by your inspection and
  your mechanic's inspection.  Compare the negotiated price (including
  immediate repairs) - negotiate-out the HONDA extended warranty.  Compare
  the predictive cost of ownership between the two (or others) - both cars
  could have remarkedly similar maintenance costs after the first six
  months.  Buy it.

I had the same problem about five years ago, right after my car fell
out of warranty.  It's the fresh air blower.  My first attempt to
fix it involved removing and pulling apart the electric motor,
lubricating with white lithium grease.  Didn't last more than a few
months, presumably melting away.  Next year, I tried wheel bearing
grease.  Same result.

Finally got me some o' that Bosch grease they sell for lubricating
distributors, spedometer cables, and the like.  Consistency and
appearance of ear wax.  It fixed the problem.  Perhaps I owe a thank
you to some now-deaf person in an obscure corner of the planet.

You are not going to enjoy getting the fresh air blower out.  And
you are really going to dislike getting it back in.  In my car, it
was a question of a millimeter or two too little room on the cockpit
side of the firewall.  I used a wide putty knife between the blower
frame and the firewall to coax it in.

As mentioned above, I pulled the motor completely apart.  I cleaned
everything and lubricated the bushings and thrust washers inside it.

Trivia time:  You'll find that -- gasp -- you have a Japanese part
in your car.  The motor's made by Nippondenso.  But they're in fact
about 30% owned by Robt Bosch.  Also, if you look closely at a
connector on the motor, you'll see a Mercedes crest.

Before going to this extreme (wait till you get the bill...), try
replacing the rigid metal OE clamps at the base of the reservoir
with garden-variety metal hose clamps.  They're more flexible and
do a better job of sealing the hose to the reservoir's
nipples.  Porsche finally figured this out and issued a tech
bulletin a few years ago.

For extra points, use hose clamps with rounded edges which will not
cut the hose.  Available from Wurth, or available from your friendly
neighborhood PCNA parts guy: 999.512.346.02 for the supply hose,
and 999.512.450.02 for the return hose.

This is correct for cars with the Bosch Motronic ML.3 and forward,
which includes the 944S/2 and 928S4.  These ECU's are adaptive,
although I unfortunately have yet to get a definite and credible
explanation of exactly what they adapt to or around.  The best
understanding I have been given has to do with a) particular sensors,
such as engine temp, and b) knock characteristics on a per-cylinder
basis.

If you do make changes to the car, such as replacing a sender, it
is a good idea to reset the ECU.  Leave the battery disconnected for
more than a few minutes (sorry, no idea exactly how long).  Of course,
whenever I do anything nontrivial, I always disconnect the battery
first anyways.

Porsche also prescribes an "adaptation cycle" when resetting.  It
basically consists of driving the car at a variety of loads and
RPMS, if memory serves.  This is written down either as a tech
bulletin somewhere or in a workshop manual, and is probably recommended
more for the benefit of a non-car-guy customer who will receive
the car from a professional than for the do-it-yourselfer, who
will tolerate a little funkiness while things adapt.

It is not unusual on these cars to see a problem exactly once.  Then
the ECU patches around it, and it becomes difficult to reproduce.
There was a 928S4 in the shop not too long ago that ran like poo
exactly once for the customer.  It ultimately turned out to be a
bad engine temp sender.  Because of the adaptation, finding it
was pretty laborious -- go through everything, looking for an out
of spec sender, etc.

John,

Your description has me a little puzzled.  For the noise to be
independant of gear means that the problem lies after the gear
box.  Yet you describe it as depending on the state of clutch
engagement.  Perhaps what you're really seeing is something which
depends not on the clutch, but on loading the drivetrain.

As a rule of thumb, if the noise is a clicking or clunking, it
is a CV (or four).  If it's a whirring, wheel bearing.

Hope this helps.

The *BIGGEST* problem in working on sports cars is that people that either
don't know any better, or are making money off people that don't know
any better, sell *ALL SORTS* of crap that has a legitimate application
in *RACING* for people to use on the street. The obvious error here is
in assuming that if it's good for racing, then it must be *GOOD* as in
works well, lasts long time. Real racing is about totally disposable
engines, cars, parts -- and sometimes people. But *ALWAYS* it's about
never ever letting anything fail under use that could cost you a win,
so everything is checked again and again and again. 

If you use dual springs on any of the air cooled heads, you *MUST* grind 
down the valve guide bosses. IF you do this, the valve, guide and all, will
tip under load, eventually inducing cracks in the boss and a seperation 
from the head. You don't even want to think about what happens next...
This is true for all VW and Porsche "flat four" engines, from the lowliest
25 HP Type I to the baddest 2.7 liter radicalize Type IV.

The "dual spring" theory came about in the early '60s when the go-fast
drag Bug guys noted that Chevy's had dual springs and didn't have valve
float, so if they used the Chevy springs, maybe they wouldn't either.
Works OK if you can afford to burn a set of heads every 20-30 hours of 
engine operation....

Taking an entirely different approach, like engineering a solution that
provided answers under all the constraints, the FAT heavy duty springs 
provide enough pressure to positively seat the valves at speeds up to 
9-10k RPM, without providing enough extra pressure to unduely wear the 
valve or seat.

And you *REALLY* want to use the *REAL* ATE sodium filled exhaust valves
for street engines. For racing, sure, Manley or TRW is great -- but you're
going to check and replace them every 10-15 hours, aren't you?

BTW, when was the last time anyone out there tore down a "perfectly good" 
street engine just to see how it was doing??? Thought so...

Well, I know that you can actually run an engine for a while without any oil
in it...it won't be very good for it, but it can be done.  The trick with hosing
off the rocker arms, etc. is just that...a trick.  The remaining oil film will
not wash off to the point where the engine will immediately seize,,,again, I 
don't recommend this, but it can be done at home.  If you ever go to a VW
show, they have a fun little event between the drag racing and the bikini
contest (incredibly progressive bunch, hmm?) called the engine blow.  Basically,
they take an old, worn-out engine, drain the oil, hook it up to a battery and
a fuel supply, and wire the throttle open.  Usually the engine will run at
6000 RPM or so for 3-5 minutes before it seizes and dies.  The engine in the
commercial was running at *maybe* 1500 RPM *maximum*.  At this speed, the engine
will last *much* longer than if it was running at 3 times the speed.  Besides,
VW engines have a tendency to grenade at over 5000 RPM anyway, while a water
cooled pushrod engine can take *huge* amounts of abuse.

Tom,

I don't know if the rest of the 1970 US 911Ts had the same emissions setup
as the CA cars but here's a description of mine...

There should be a rectangular box (charcoal canister?) mounted near the
driver side hood strut (it's attached to the underside of the cowling by a
rubber strap so it may be kinda hard to see) that the large diameter vent
line connects to.  Besides the large diameter line from the gas tank, there
should also be a small diameter line from the box that runs to an exit
behind the driver side battery compartment.  This line is also connected to
the fuel tank via a "Y" connector that's partially obscured by the filler
neck.

You should probably check all these lines considering their age.  Mine were
so brittle/fossilized that the main vent line wasn't flexible enough to
connect to the tank and the box at the same time.  Just make sure any
replacement hose is rated for gasoline.

Dear readers,

Another novice 944 question.  My low-mileage 1983 944's oil pressure needle
jumps immediately to the peg (greater than 5 bar) upon startup, and despite
our hot weather, remains there.  The owner's manual discusses how pressure
can normally drop a bit at certain times, but it unnerves me to see it at 5
bar all the time.  Do I have a problem?  What should the readings be under
various conditions?

Interesting note: compared the performance stats of my car with those of
several newer Japanese cars.  There are many sedans and "sporty" cars with
better 0-60 mph nos. etc.  And of course the several expensive sports cars
with genuine under-5.5 sec 0-60 times, excellent skidpad nos....  The
machines really have come along.  Nonetheless, this car is sure fun on a
twisty mountain road (lots here).  It will go around the turns faster than my

Appreciate any thoughts on the oil pressure.

Subject: Re: 944 oil pressure question

Hunter,

This is probably a bad oil pressure sender, but no guarantees.  Could
also be a wiring problem.  KInd of unlikely your car is making over
five bar oil pressure at idle, even if the pressure relief valve
were busted.

Unlike most senders, the oil pressure sender has greater impedence
with greater gauge values.  At 5 bar, it should show about 184 ohms.
So if the wiring goes open, you'll see a pegged gauge.

The senders do go bad with time.  Until recently, they had a bakelite
ring between the threaded section and the main case.  It would swell
and distort, and would leak oil.  This little flaw was fixed in the
last year or so, and the new ones have all-metal cases.

Replacement calls for a 24 mm crowfoot and extension, plus some manual
dexterity.  You don't need to drain the oil if you work quickly.

Subject: RE: 'Freon' refrigerants


Lee Atkinson had a few concerns about refrigerants aka Freon

Freon is a trade name of DuPont for its line of CFC HCFC refrigerants.

1. R12 and R134a compatability issue.
	The two compounds are relatively quite similiar in 
	there thermophysical properties.  But the diferances
	are significant enough to require engineering changes
	to A/C systems that where not meant to be converted.
	The most significant problems are lubricant miscibility
	and permearbility of the hoses.
		
	The mineral bases oils that work well with chlorinated
	refrigerants, R12 R22 ect, DO NOT work properly with
	Hydrogenated Hydrocarbons like R134a.  The oil is
	not Miscible, will not stay in the flow steam.  So
	the pump will starve for oil, as the oil falls
	out of flow in the condensor ect.

	Most hoses designed for R12 do not have adequate
	barier for R134a.  So for the most part the
	R134a will escape through hose walls at an UNacceptable
	rate.
	
	In addition R134a has a higher operating pressure
	so the compressor must raise it to a higher
	pressure to get the refrigerant to condense 
	as it passes through the condensor.  This requires
	a relativly greater effort in the pump at more 
	durable hoses, seals, control sensors. 
	This also applies to the cappilary tubes or evaporator
	control valve.  They were not meant to operate 
	at the pressures of R134a.

	All this means that although a system can, and have been,
	modified it is not practical or efficient considering
	it is much easier and cheaper to HORD some R12!
	($200 for 20lb. can of R12 < $250 -$1000 for mods)

2. What about R22
	R22 is a class II compound
	it is scheduled to end production in 2020 or 2030
	with scale baked quotas along the way.	
	R22 is a HCFC HydoFluroCarbon and is O-zone depletion
	/potential/ is considerably less than CFC's like R12.
	
3. What about R134a cooling capacity
	R134a is a less effecient and less capable refrigerant
	than R12.  Of course engineering/technology improvements
	will see its ability to do the job equall, or exceed
	curent R12 systems.  (simply, it takes somewhat more
	energy for a R134a system to produce so much cooling,
	and it takes a higher flow rate of R134a as well-
	in comparison to R12)

Whiles there are many experiments occuring in the R134a conversion
area, I am inclined to believe that most auto owners
have there A/C systems serviced and repaired for leaks and
filled with the original type refrigerant.  Leave the
expensive conversions for stationary equipment where

Subject: RE: electric vehicles


Having been involved with the SunRayce project and learning quite
a bit about electric vehicles along the way I can say
that it is Very UNlilkely there will be significant numbers
of Ecars sold in the USA by 2000.
  I assume gasoline will stay under $2 gal.

The commuting distances and performance expectations (exceleration)
of electrics are just not going to happen soon (if ever)
In Europe where most people live in a smaller towns an electric
is practical, and $$ of electrics are much more attractive (High Fuel Prices
High taxes, stiff inspection requirements favor electomobiles)

What I forsee is a migration to CNG and Hybrid technologies
especially at the $2 - $3 gallon for gas point.
Lots of CNG activity in Gas rich Texas, even Omaha
has a CNG 'gas' station.  And you can refill at home
with a compressor attatched to your gas utility line.

Just a reminder to all you folks of the 1950's when GM and Firestone
(or ?? tire co) and others arranged for the removal of many
thousands of clean efficient electric buses and trollies
from the streets of America.  Don't be suprised
that the big interests will stear things in there direction
in the Electrics Game.

opps I forgot to mention about hte spot
in dash next to fog light switch.  On ROW
Europe models this is a spot for a Fog Aux Brake Light
switch (as seen in schematics) You can pop off
the cover and put in an $$$ OEM switch
or do as I did and pop it out, drill a hole throug, and 
put in a toggle switch of my own design.  works great looks good.

Subject: 944 heater system


To Jay Ellisn

Sorry for the delay been ridiculously busy.

The vacuum control selenoids on 86+ 944's as mentioned are just behind
dash (touching back side of dash, almost) just left of the 
glove box (may have changed on AirBag mods)
There is a wiring loom to the selenoids as well
The Selenoids are likely Nipnondenso

As mentioned watch the lever on the heater control
valve for movement when temp knob is vectored
you can even move it to closed position by hand
if there is vacuum to the valve, pull the hose
and the valve will pop back open.

There are two and a vacuum supply feeds both from the 
engine compartment.  another hose leaves each on its way
to the heater valve and air recirculate pots.
if the recirculate pots close the doors in the air
entry under the cowl your vacuum is apparently OK.

If vacuum and electric detective work fails just tie the
vacuum line to the heater valve into the vacuum supply
in engine compartment (supply leads to the vacuum suply
'ball' under cowl.  and plug the hose that led to
the valve with a small screw or whatever.

If it still blows heat I'd say the valve is not holding.

Subject: Removing Mold with Lysol


A little while back people had some comments about this.

I have had a noxious odor coming from my 924S ('87) air vents. 

Anyway, it could be mold, or a leak, or both. It does not leak enough
to drip. 

With the engine cold, I used the key to turn on the electrical system and
get the fans going. Yup, it smells. Smells worse with A/C. This is consistent
with mold growing in a moist spot in the a/c system.

Now here is where I get confused. The air intake for the heater/vent fan
is in the center below the windshield at the back of the engine. It is
surrounded by a little cage. Air gets sucked in here when the vent fan runs.
I feel ok about spraying lysol in there.

But, now switch to A/C. This fan goes off ! The high speed fan on the 
front bumber switches on. I tried spraying some lysol in front of the car
and of course it gets sucked in. But I dont think thats too effective. 
I also feel funny spraying a foreign substance around when I dont know
where its going -- even if the engine is off and cold -- call me a perfectionist.

Where should I be spraying this stuff for maximum effect ?

Thanks

Subject: No Oil 


I had the sad occasion to have a neighbor go to GREAT time
and expense to rebuild the engine in his Renault Dauphine
only to burn it up after forgetting to put engine oil in.

The car got up to the end of the block on its assembly
grease and than seized.  What a pathetic site that was
6 months and $1500 down the drain.

Moral of the Story..If the manufacturer recomends it
do it..Slick 50  and other PTFE brews are not recomended
by any known manufacturer..Dont use it.
(sounds like that stupid Club commercial ads copy)

PTFE falls out of suspention and collects in places
like oil galleries, oil filters, lifters.  Although
it may reduce friction it has various negative side
effects.

I suggest you use Synthetic Oil like Mobil One
if you are bent on spending extra money. 
I would suggest Synthetics in cold and very cold 
climates especially due to the lower cold temp
viscocity. Otherwise just use the best convintional
lube and proper oil change intervals ect..

Subject: 5.1K 911

I have a chance at purchasing a 1977 911S for $5109, 86K mi.   I'm making an
appointment to drive it, but physically it looks perfect.  Interior and
exterior are flawless, including chrome trim aorund headlights.   It starts
readily and seems to be unusually quiet in compariosn to my friend's old
911sc.  Engine is remarkably clean top and bottom.  He has some of the repair
history and has taken it recently to the local P dealr for "routine" service
he claims.  This included a "cylinder height adjustment" her said, showing no
documentation.  I'm assuming this is the infamous rubber muffler bearing or
the like.  Since the local dealer had his mortgage foreclosed and has had
some shady repair work, I'm reluctant.

I've seen the car locally for many years, owned by a retired UPS worker(?!?).
 He will be getting the documantation for me, as well as the 18 month
warranty left on the powertrain from the dealer.  911's of any old vintage
never sell for less than $15K here in NE PA, never mind only $5100.  Again,
excuse my 911 repair ignorance, but will I be up against having head studs
replaced, head gaskets, etc in the near future?  What maintanence am I up
against if I do purchase it?

I've encountered stoped up a/c boxes through the years.
Leaves ect get in the box and plug up the coils and
the drain hole.  
Have you tried to clear the drain hole (have not looked
for it myself).

A good idea after finding the ACTUAL PROBLEM would 
be to clean and disenfect with mild 'chlorox' or
other such brews. (recall AL on the coils
corrodes easily with certain vile potions)

Subject: 951/944 CLUTCH REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE

The following account explains in detail the prodedure of changing a
clutch in a 944/951. It also contains a list of tools, chemicals,
parts and the sources where to find them. There is a lot of helpfull
information here for the beginner/novice mechanic. With Stan's help I 
would also like to also post this via FTP access in Porschephiles.

**THANKS TO ALL FELLOW PORSCHEPHILERS WHO HELPED MAKE THIS POSSIBLE** 


86' 951 CLUTCH REPLACEMENT  (with one or two piece crosspipe)


I have just recently finished a complete clutch job on my 86' 951, which
included replacing the throwout bearing,  pressure plate,  clutch disc, pilot
bearing,  guide sleeve,  and the two needle bearings on the release lever.

I am posting my experiences so I may help others who are mechanically
inclined but cannot afford the $ 1,400.00 +  labor to do the job. 

This procedure applies to all 944 series cars, with some exceptions.

Porsche sets the shop time @
                 23 hours  ( single cross-pipe) @ $55.00 =$ 1265.00 ~
                 16 hours  ( two part cross-pipe) @ $ 55.00=$ 880.00 ~

  ~ Approximate labor rate

I completed the entire job in 2 weeks working part time, which included 
replacing the right motor mount, cleaning underbody and transmission,  
undercoating, and eliminating all corrosion. Some steps will be frustrating if 
you have never done this kind of work on this type of car.Take your time, keep 
organized, and most important have PATIENTS YOU'LL NEED IT!   


I would like to thank fellow list member Mark Sundt for all his help and support
throughout this job.  His patience and insight are greatly appreciated. Also I 
would like to thank,  Milo Dorr,  Steve Timmons,  Kevin Gross,  Jim Selders  and
 Doug Dyakar.  Without the help of these people I would never have been able to 
do this job.  Thanks to Stan and his informative Archives.

The job should not be undertaken by those without some mechanical ability. It is
not an extremely difficult job, but requires many steps especially if your car 
still has the single part cross pipe.  Organization is important!
Safety is also VERY important,  when working under a car supported
by jack stands. Take time and care when raising the car with the hydraulic jack,
utilizing the proper jack points.  A good idea would be a secondary means of 
support,  such as concrete blocks under the wheels.

I am going to explain this procedure in  detail in hopes that I
can help other list members do this job. Reviewing and researching  before you 
start is a good way to familarize yourself with the car,  and will make you more
confident, resulting in a sucessful job.  The clutch replacement on my 951' was 
the second time I have ever worked on a car, (other then basic maintenance of 
course) the first being the replacement of the front struts and strut bearings. 
I am going to list tools needed and where to find them. Part #'s will be given, 
along with chemicals needed, research material sources and torque specs.  I will
refer to the Haynes 944 manual,  the 944 Workshop Manuals( 6 volumes) including 
the Turbo supplement and Mark Sundt"s notes,  used with his permission. I have 
also included HINTS and NOTE sections to point out important areas.



I tried to make this information as accurate as possible.  If there are other 
suggestions or hints that will make this  account more complete feel free to add
your comments to the list.

     GOOD LUCK !

***** A NOTE ON TOOLS *****

Having the proper tools when working on a Porsche is very important!!
Using good quality tools is also very important!!
I have found out the hard way!! I was frustrated more times then I can remember 
while doing this job!!  Now AFTER the job is complete I know what tools I should
have used,  and now you will know BEFORE you start.  Of course not all tools 
listed are mandatory, the variety listed will make life easier.

I have found that most Craftsman tools are very poor in quality. The sockets and
wrenches work ok, but the ratchets and mechanical tools are sub-standard in 
quality. I speak about the "newer" tools,  I know that the older product is much
better. Hazett and Heyco are the German tools used to assemble German cars,  
they are very good and are made to fit in some of those tight places. Snap On,  
Mac,  Matco,  S&K/Facom are good tools especially Snap On( great quality and big
bucks ).  There are very few "special" tools  required to do this job. A 
somewhat complete list of tools and the resources for them will follow.

RATCHETS:

1/4" straight
1/4" flex head (Snap On)
3/8" straight
3/8" flex head (long handle)  Clutch housing bolts (I used Craftsman)
1/2" straight
breaker bar (for that real stubborn rusted hardware)

UNIVERSALS:

1/4"   3/8"  1/2"

EXTENSIONS:

1/4"  long  medium  short  (aprox.)  3"    6"    12"   18" 
3/8"  long  medium  short
1/4" flexible (ie. Snap On)
3/8" flexible  ""           ""

SOCKETS:

1/4" Set W/ 13mm, 15mm semi-deep
1/4" universal sockets  10mm, 13mm, 15mm
1/4 Magnetic  10mm, 13mm

3/8" set W/10mm, 13mm, 15mm, 17mm, 19mm semi-deep
3/8" universal sockets 13mm, 15mm, 17mm, 19mm

1/2"   13mm, 15mm, 17mm, 19mm

ADAPTERS:

1/4"---3/8"
3/8"---1/2"
1/2"---3/8"


WRENCHES

Combination standard length: 8mm, 10mm, 13mm, 14mm, 15mm, 17mm, 19mm
Box long: 8mm, 10mm, 13/15mm, 17/19mm
Flarenut crowsfoot (Snap On): 13mm, 15mm
Torque Wrench flex head  3/8"  (5-75 ft. lbs.)ie. (Snap On # QJFR275E)


DRIVERS:

3/8" Hex  6mm, 8mm,10mm,12mm (avoid the Craftsman,  bits come out of  sockets   
                            because they are held in poorly. Get the kind that  
                             are held in with a pin or set screw.(Hazett)       
                                                        

3/8" 12 Point 8mm  (for cheesehead bolts, hold on pressure plate,               
      drive axles)  DON'T CHEAP OUT ON THIS TOOL!!  Buy                      
either the Hazett/Heyco or Snap On.  @ $ 18.00 it is                      well 
worth it! Snap On calls this tool "Triple                      Square" The 
flywheel is secured with 12mm cheeseheads.

SPECIAL TOOLS:

Clutch alignment tool   (source see below)  @ $ 5.95
8mm * 150mm  bolt     ( for removing release lever shaft) (pilot bearing)
Vice Grips  10"
Hammer (not so special)                       
Magnetic Pick-up (for that hardware you thought you would never see again)
Rubber Mallet (Maybe needed for intake manifold removal)
Safety glasses or goggles
Creeper


MISC:


Various Screwdrivers    straight blade ,  phillips #1, #2
Jackstands 3 ton (4 ea.) heavyduty   (12" minimum  17" max.  aprox.)


Hydraulic Jack  2  1/4 ton @ least  (Min. height 5" inches, maximum height 18"  
                                    @ least)

Blocks of wood  &  short 2 * 4's




   NOTES:

      * Odd Socket Sizes & wrenches  10mm, 13mm, 15mm, 17mm, 19mm               
          
        are used 95% of the time. I don't think I ever used any even          
sizes. Maybe 14mm on exhaust system?
          
      * Flex Head Ratchets are very usefull , don't overlook these          
tools.

      * Universals and flex sockets for those weird angles

      * 12 point sockets and fine tooth ratchets are a great help in          
confined areas.
 
      * Magnetic  1/4"socket 10mm and 13mm is very handy along with a          
flexible extension and or universal when working in the tight          engine 
compartment spaces.
     
      * I accomplished the work with much less, but this is what I          
recommend after completing the job. That is if you have the $$$.

could tell is that the Porsche part carries a (2) year warranty while the 
EuroSelect is (1) year. The Porsche part is almost double the price.  Check out 
Excellence magazine for current prices & other vendors.



PROCEDURE:

FIRST IT NEEDS TO BE DETERMINED IF YOU HAVE A SINGLE OR 2 PART
CROSSOVER PIPE (the diagram is in the Turbo supplement (p. 30-3)
All 86' 951's originally had the single part cross-pipe.  Under warranty PCNA 
replaced the non-bellowed type headers when they cracked,  with the improved 
accordian style. This was done for the first 5 years or 50K.  The one part cross
pipe was updated to the current two part type under "hidden" warranty with the 
headers. 
 
The old style did not have a seperate pipe going up to the wastegate. The clutch
bellhousing cannot be removed without this piece removed!  Believe me I tried . 
So if you have the single cross pipe,  it must be completely removed all the way
up to the turbocharger.  This involves removing the intake manifold, and lots 
more stuff in the engine compartment, in order to access the turbo exhaust 
bolts.

The crosspipe is only on the 951 models (turbo only) so if you have a 944
normal or plain "S", consider yourself lucky in ths case.

               THIS CREATES  A LOT MORE WORK!!!

Lets hope you have the new 2 section cross-pipe! 

Jack up car & support with 2 jackstands
 
Remove  aluminium engine protection shield

Determine which crosspipe you have (explanation above)

*** This may be a good time to determine if you would like to replace
     the headers  and crosspipe with the new updated parts. It's not 
     cheap!  I elected not to do it at this time. I hope the headers
     don't crack!

If you have the single part pipe, lower the car and proceed as follows:

      * This part of the job is much easier while on the ground *


If you do have the two part jump up and down and proceed to the (+++).

   NOTE: As parts are removed,  label and store them in plastic parts           
bags.     BE ORGANIZED!!  BE ORGANIZED!!
   
     HINT!  Be careful when removing and installing hardware in and
            around engine compartment. There are many "black holes"
            where nuts and misc. items just disappear. I used a shop
            rag just under the working area to catch falling objects.
            A telescoping magnetic pick-up tool works great for 
            hardware retrieval!

FUEL RAIL & INJECTORS:
  
      * Place covers over fenders

       +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
      * Remove battery ground  (shield terminal from possible ground          
contact) 
       +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CRUISE CONTROL CABLE:

     * Disconnect cable on cruise control motor (If applicable)
        A. remove retaining clip on cable
        B. loosen and slide cable housing locking nut toward motor
        C. pull end of cable housing through hole, slide cable through          
  split in cable housing mount.
        D. remove cruise control cable clamp ( on manifold )

     *  Pull off vacuum hoses on pressure regulator and pressure
         damper. ( inspect at same time) Replace if damaged.


     * Remove fuel Rail (be careful of plastic cap @ end)

     * Remove distributor cap with spark plug wires  (I left the cap on         
and just removed the spark plug ends wires only)

     * Disconnect fuel connections to fuel rail: (2)  (one is a clamp the 
otheris         a nut.) try to catch fuel that leaks out of the system. I 
covered exposed         ends with plastic bags and wrapped with electrical tape.
DANGER! Be         careful with fumes from fuel.Work in a well ventilated area, 
and not         around gas pilot lites!

     * Fuel Injectors ( Carefully remove fuel rail from injectors starting at
                       one end. More fuel will spill out of rail.               
         Next remove injectors one at a time from the intake                    
    manifold Set aside. 

INTAKE MANIFOLD:
             

        Hose clamps on many intercooler connections

        Remove black aluminium intercooler tubes

        Electrical connection to throttle body

        Throttle and cruise control cables w/ clamp on
               intake manifold.

        Vacuum tube at throttle body (underneath)

        13mm bolt @ front

        10mm bolt @ dipstick
 
        Remove dipstick shaft

        2-5mm allen bolts @ oil filter

       10mm bolt @ electrical harness in back

** If intake manifold will not come loose, tap wih rubber mallet to free     
manifold from the gaskets. Cover intake ports. Turn manifold over so turbo-     
charger is visible.

   * Guard for master cylinder (2-10 mm bolts/3 nuts) difficult to remove/sharp
     edges/will bend to facilitate removal. Good luck!  It is easier to access  
    bottom two nuts when car is lifted.

    +++        +++      +++      +++

   * Remove ground strap bolt @ top of Clutch bellhousing (if removal of this   
   ground bolt poses a   problem I would remove the heater valve that is in     
 the way) Removal will require bleeding & topping off  coolant system .       A 
1/4" 10mm universal with a long 1/4" extension worked for me . NOTE:       This 
bolt has been  replaced with a 8 * 25 mm stud w/ copper nut. I really       
don't know if this will make things easier or not?

    * Remove speed & reference transmitters (2) 10mm flex  socket
                BG-B
                DG-D w/special spacer
               ( replace bolts if damaged; turn side to side while pulling      
            straight out.)

    * Remove cable clamp holding starter cable @ upper attachment point
       (on bellhousing) 10mm bolt w/washer NOTE:(This attachment point may be 
       more acessiable once central tube is disconnected from clutch housing.  

            ** A NOTE ON JACKSTANDS**     SAFTEY IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!
  
   Use the heavyduty 3 ton stands with the lever (Imparts carries these @ $27.00
per pair.).  Try to avoid the spot welded sheer pin type. The 6 ton jacks 
minimum height requires the use of smaller secondary stands,  because it is very
difficult to raise the car the 16" on the first lift. I would reccomend the 
smaller 3 ton units with the lower minimium clearance( 12"). In order to raise 
it up with enough working clearance,  it is safer to do this process in two 
stages,  lifting one side at a time. An assistant  spotting the opposite side is
a great help.

       A working height of 18" worked well for me, this gave me enough clearance
to remove the transmission. The 6 ton units would be required to get the full 
24" clearance, but not nessessary Secure the stands  at front and rear. I 
postioned the rear jacks under the rear axle cross member mount,  and the front 
jacks at the front most jack points.  Other positions may be used ,  depending 
on what jack stand pad configuration you have. For added stability , short  
2*4's may be utilized between jack pad and liting point . Find secure points!! 


   * Raise car & support with jackstands


EXHAUST SYSTEM:

   * Remove starter & slave cyclinder exhaust shields

   * Wastegate to exhaust clamp

   *  Disconnect Oxygen sensor 

   * Emission check tube (top bracket is attached with upper clutch bellhousing
      bolt.

   * Loosen (but cannot remove) wastegate bracket to torque tube (mark postion)

             NOTE: Soak all bolts on exhaust system with Wurth Rost Off or      
              equivalent prior to removal.  A must for frozen hardware!
                                  

   * Bolts at wastegate (4 nuts & washers @ studs,  4 bolts & washers @ threads)

   * Bolts, washers, nuts at both exhaust manifolds (6)

   * Bolts, nuts, washers at turbo(4) (top front is difficult to access; use    
   15mm crowfoot with short extension) 

   * Remove Cross-pipe

         NOTE: Always label wires & connections as to where they go

   * Remove starter (2 electrical connections) replace black rubber protective
      boot if damaged

   *  Remove wastegate with holder (bypass valve) from central tube 2 bolts     
   (disconnect hose clamp ; inspect vacuum hose for damage)

   * Remove starter harness clamp at lower attachment point (replace if missing
      mine was.

   * Remove clamp for hose to slave cylinder (be careful not to damage hydraulic
     clutch line)

   * Remove exhaust clamp @ side of catalytic converter & remove short wastegate
     pipe ( probably not necessary, but I did this)

   * Remove nuts, washers (4) at turbo exhaust pipe

   * Remove bolts, nuts, washers (6) on the three exhaust hangers, hold
      level &  lower down., (be carefull not to damage threaded studs on turbo  
     exhaust pipe.) Withdraw entire exhaust system to rear.

   * Remove  catalytic and rear muffler exhaust shields

   * Leave exhaust hangers on rubber mounts.


TRANSMISSION: 
     

   * Remove shift boot lever (retaining clip at top )(Be careful of plastic     
 cosmetic  items, remove   ashtray,  two screws, lift center piece slightly     
 & push out leather boot  from bottom.) set aside.

   * Wedge clutch pedal down (need to do this so rear axles will turn with      
drive-shaft , thus postioning clamping sleeve for  removal.)

   * Remove large protective cover on transmission bellhousing, exposing       
clamping sleeve

   * Postion driveshaft (turn rear wheels) and loosen clamping sleeve through   
   opening 2 allen bolts (8mm hex with extension)

   * Mark position of clamping sleeve,  slide toward transmission (tap if stuck)

   * Unwedge clutch pedal

   * Remove transmission fluid  ( A good time for this,  but not necessary)

   * Clean area around where drive axles connect to transmission (this will     
 prevent contamination of CV-Joint grease.

   * Disconnect driveshaft axles from transmission and suspend level with wire  
    from shocks

   * Cover drive axle ends and transmission flanges with small plastic bags and 
     close (try to keep all CV-Joint grease intact & clean)

   * Remove back-up light connection (2 wires) color coded, terminals not keyed.

   * Remove speedo cable ( be careful of conector when disconecting)

   * Remove speedo housing(threaded) set aside, cover hole on transmission.

   *  Push back rubber dust cover on shift rod @ end,  cut wire and remove
      shift-rod  bolt on selector linkage. 

   * Remove circlip from shift-lever 

   * Unbolt shift lever with bearing bracket from central tube  ( pushing foam  
    aside) use 10mm socket with extension (2 bolts), mark position of pivot     
 flange on central tube, for reassembly.

   *  While pressing down on foam insulation turn shift rod over,  and push     
  selector rod foward in cavity about 300mm (12") This will move shift rod      
 out of transmission protective tube. NOTE: Try not to damage insulation        
foam sheet! 

   * Move black protective tube for shift rod back toward rear of car. (not     
 necessary) I tried to do this as described in the 944 Workshop Manual       
Vol.11 p.30-07 but was unsuccessful. The tube came out easily when I       
removed the transmission.

      NOTE:  According to the Workshop Manual if the retainers on the tube      
        become damaged during this rocess, the tube should be replaced.

   * Put wooden block between central tube  and rear suspension cross member.   
   (This keeps stress  off the torque when transmission is removed, keeping     
 torque tube level.

   * Run in hydraulic jack under transmission and support NOTE: Center of       
gravity is more towards rear of transmission.. Have an assistant help with      
this procedure, it helps.

   * Remove housing bolts (4) These bolts are not all the same length, make     
 sure they are labeled. NOTE: I had trouble with the top driver's side       
allen bolt. I did'nt have enough clearance for a hex socket (10mm). I took      
the hex bit out of the socket and used a wrench on the bit.   Not fun!       
Good luck!

   *  Remove transmission suspension mounting bolts at top of transmission.(2)
     (make sure jack is supporting trans. This will keep the suspension bolts   
   from binding in shaft.

   * With an assistant stabizing transmission on jack cup lower transmission    
  slowly down while clearing spare tire well. Readjust posistion on cup if      
necessary. Observe protective tube for damage and seperation from housing.

 NOTE: If your transmission is equipped with oil cooler  treat it them with     
   care,  they damage easily. Once trans.is clear pull jack towards rear,       
 while watching hanging axles for clearance.

   * Remove Transverse axle strut between body and axle (4 bolts)

   * Remove fuel filter hose clamp  (Let fuel filter hang)

   * Remove transmission carrier(4 bolts) NOTE: Check out  Silent-Bloc Mount    
  for damage and stress.  Usually they last quite a long time. Replace if       
damaged. An expensive part.($ 150.00) Aprox.

   * Remove clutch slave cylinder and hang out of way (2 bolts)

   * Mark position of exhaust carriers on central tube, and slaken but don't    
  remove.

CLUTCH:

   * Put jack under oil pan with a piece of wood between jack cup and grilled   
   oil pan.

      NOTE: This is to prevent engine from settling to far at rear once         
    bellhousing and central are removed.

   * Unbolt 4 bolts from central tube to clutch bellhousing

   * Slide central tube rearward with selector rod after rotating 90 degrees (  
    be careful not to damage brake lines when rotating central tube NOTE: Wear  
    leather gloves when handling transaxle to avoid injuries. Note position of  
    catch hooks. Exhaust clamps should be free to slide as needed.

   * Remove temporary  support block for central tube at rear of car 

   * Loosen release lever shaft retaining bolt.

   * Thread  8mm * 150mm bolt into release lever shaft on clutch bellhousing;   
   with Vice-Grips attached to end of bolt, tap Grips with hammer to remove     
 shaft. NOTE: A shorter bolt can be used, but I needed the extra leverage       
to remove shaft. (REFER to Haynes Manual Chapter 8  p.136)

   * Remove bellhousing bolts (4) total  2 @ top,  2 @ bottom  NOTE: The bolts  
    at the top are a little difficult to acccess. Use a long flex head ratchet  
    (Use 17mm or 19mm ?  12 point socket.)

   * Remove bellhousing with release lever.

   * With 8 mm 12 point driver, remove 9 cheesehead bolts. Uniformly loosen     
 bolts on pressure plate.

      NOTE: Use a HIGH QUALITY 12 point tool! Make sure tool is seated properly 
            in head, and that pressure is applied when turning out bolt, this   
          may help from stripping out the head. ( the head of these             
cheeseheads are real easy to strip out!!) 

   * Remove pressure plate with release bearing and clutch Disc (Be careful the 
     pressure plate is somewhat heavy.

   * Remove starter ring from pressure plate ( I used a hammer and a block of   
   wood. Spray with penetrating spray. Remove evenly as not to bend ring.

      NOTE: The release bearing  and pressure plate are packaged separately,    
         therefore you must assemble these as one working part.

   * Install release bearing on pressure plate ( have an assistant push down on 
     pressure plate while you install retaining ring. NOTE: compare assembly of 
     old unit.

   * Install starter ring on new pressure plate ( align bolt holes and tap on   
   evenly)

      NOTE: This is a very precise fit make sure ring goes on even and bolt     
        holes are exactly aligned.

   PILOT BEARING:

     The pilot bearing is a bearing that supports the rear of the crankshaft.   
   As you can see it has taken a lot of work to get to this point,       
therefore it is a good idea that this part be replaced. 

   * Removal requires the use of a special hooked puller tool, but this method  
    should work fine.
 
   * Find a 8" bolt with a head that is slightly smaller then the bearing       
opening. Attach Vice-Grips to other end.  Hook head on other side of       
bearing,  and lightly tap on pliers with a hammer.

    NOTE: A long bolt will give you more leverage. I had a little trouble with  
         this. HINT: Tap out evenly. ( refer to Haynes Manual Chapter 8  p.140 )

   * Remove bearing and clean out bore in the crankshaft recess

   *  Lightly oil sides of new pilot bearing and install (use a suitable size   
    socket with extension and hammer NOTE: Make sure bearing is tapped in       
evenly!

  GUIDE SLEEVE: 

   * Remove bolts(M 6) holding guide sleeve  on clutch bellhousing ; replace    
  with new part if damaged or worn ( torque=11 ft. lbs. / 15Nm )

  NEEDLE BEARINGS:

   NOTE: Spray the needle bearing bore area with a penetrating spray to aid in  
        removal.

   * Punch out old  needle bearings ( 2 ) with proper size socket and extension.

  NOTE: These were tough,  I used a block of wood under the lever,  with the    
     extension going through the opposite needle bearing shaft. I would have    
     used a vice , but did not have one at the time.

   * Oil sides of bearings and install, and make sure they punch in level. A    
  very tight fit.
    

FLYWHEEL INSPECTION:

   * Check flywheel for wear and scoring (Heat checking). If imperfections are  
    slight, a machine shop can  machine the surface to spec.  
     
     


CLUTCH INSTALLATION

   * Make sure all clutch surface areas are free of grease and oil.  It is      
important that friction surfaces are perfectly clean.

   * Apply a thin coat of MoS2 grease to guide sleeve,  splines of central      
shaft, and grooved  ballbearing/flywheel area.

   * Lubricate release lever fork(needle sleeves,  ball socket, and fork. 

   NOTE: Solid white lubricating paste # AOS 126 0006 is no longer used,        
  because it hardens with age,  replace with MoS2.

   * Use clutch alignment tool to center clutch plate to pressure plate

   NOTE: Make sure tool is inserted all the way into pilot bearing.

   * Apply a small amount of anti-seize to threads of cheesehead bolts, and     
 start by hand to assure that the threads won't be stripped.  Tighten       
uniformly in a diagonally opposite sequence ( 18 ft. lbs. /25Nm ).

   NOTE: Make sure you have a good  leverage  and that the tool is in level,    
      these bolt heads are real shallow. Turn flywheel to access bolts at       
   bottom for best results.  (takes some effort)

   * Install the release lever and clutch housing together on the engine       
release bearing, with cup on release lever facing slave cylinder opening.       
Two forks at end will fit under release bearing edge. Hold lever through       
slave cylinder opening while aligning.( you will understand this better       
when you do it ).

  NOTE: Make sure that the  bonded bolt on the flywheel is facing down. This    
     will prevent damage to the reference transmitters.

   * Tighten clutch housing bolts M 12 (4) two different lengths! torque=       
(54ft. lbs. /75 Nm )

  NOTE: Hand tighten these blots (this is important especially when threading   
      into an alloy material.  Starting this bolts with a socket will          
increase the chance of cross threading ( Use anti-seize on threads )

   * Move  release lever so that needle sleeves are aligned with bore in clutch 
     housing.

   * Slide in release lever shaft  so that milled face is toward securing bolt. 
     Slide in all the way ( it helps to lubricate shaft). You may need to move  
    release lever back and forth for proper alignment. Never force!  Install    
  securing bolt with back up hex nut when shaft is correctly positioned.        
torque= 7 ft. lbs. / 9.5 Nm )

   * Install  rubber seal on clutch inspection hole , if missing.

   HINT : Apply a small amount of silicone to plug sides, and you won't have
             to replace it again.

**** The sequence for assembly of central tube,  transmission,  exhaust system,
      etc...  is the reverse of removal,  with some notes below. ****

   * Slide by-pass valve  bracket on central tube to marked postion
     and tighten

   * Position by-pass valve(wastegate) between cuutch housing and body.

   * Uniformly tighten M 6 bolts connecting bypass line/ exhaust cross-pipe,
       torque to spec.  torque= 7ft. lbs /10 Nm ( sorry this is a bit vague)

   NOTE: Always use new seal rings ( packing rings) on exhaust system!

   * When all axhaust system bolts have been inserted,  tighten the flange      
connection between the turbo charger and exhaust system first. 

   NOTE: torque specs. exhaust bolts( Pay attention to different size bolts!!)

         M 8 bolts     14 + 1.4 ft. lbs. /20 + 2 Nm
         M 10 bolts   29 + 3.6 ft. lbs. /40 + 5 Nm

   * Run car and check exhaust system for leaks.

   * Once exhaust system has cooled down, retighten all bolts and nuts to       
specified torque ( see above)

   NOTE: It is very important to retighten the flange connection between the by-
          pass line and exhaust cross-pipe. Refer to Workshop Manual "Turbo     
     supplement" p. 30-7  # 6.

   NOTE: When installing heat shields and guards, make sure they are solid and  
        free from vibration. ( ie.  center catalytic converter shield )

   NOTE: If insulation sheet foam was damaged when shift rod was moved, replace
         or repair if possible. 


INTAKE MANIFOLD :

   * Assembly is reverse of  disassembly,  with some notes provided below.


   * Install master cylinder guard with car still on stands ( this way it will 
be       easier to access bottom 2 nuts.
   
   * NOTE: There is an electrical harness that runs along the front edge of     
       this guard. Make sure that the guard is not binding on this cable        
    bundle, this will make alignment almost impossible. I slid the turbo        
    pump bracket  for more clearance. You can also loosen turbo pump on         
   bracket,  but be careful not to stress the bottom  waterpump hoses.          
  This can cause the motor shaft to bind resulting in a inoperative             
pump. This happened to me. I was about to order a new unit,  but             the
P-files. All I did was loosen the clamp on the bracket
           and moved the pump down,  It worked !  Thanks Jim

    ** This pump has been updated to a more robust design,  and I imagine this  
       problem was resolved.

    * Make sure that that the ( 4 ) intake manifold gaskets are replaced if the 
      manifold is removed.

    * NOTE:  I would reccommend using a gasket removing solvent to remove       
       gaskets.  (ie. Wurth Gasket remover # 89091000 ) I wish I had            
  used this !

    * When installing intercooler lines and tubes,  connect all lines first     
  then tighten clamps. ( make sure clamp below throttle housing does not        
obstruct the movement of the throttle cam.

    * Check out your air filter,  replace if needed.

    * Inspect all fuel injector seals and O-rings. Replace if cracked or        
damaged.

    NOTE: Inspect the seal around the injector needles for hairline cracks.

    * Make sure all spark plug wires are routed and laced properly, and inspect 
      condition.

Confusion abounds.  Porsche dealer has "carbon" Zymol ($37.95) which is 
highly touted.  Consumer Reports seems to say Liquid Meguiar's better 
(substantially) than Paste Meguiar'sand that Zymol is not worth the extra 
buck(s) for the bang.  For "mid-Michigan" (Lansing) conditions (NOT 
WINTERS), what's the list's best advice.  Do I simply bite the bullet on

I would make sure the car hasn't been in an accident, have the frame, 
body, and paint checked by a porsche shop.  I'd say the engine is a 
gamble, no matter what shape it is in today...

Don't know about the engine, but if it's the original 2.7, even if 
rebuilt, there are design problems making them less reliable than sc 
engines, though the '77 2.7s have some improvements over '75 to '76 2.7's.

IMHO, it's a good buy at that price, if the frame and body are straight, 
but I would save up $5K for a 3.x litre newer engine, just in case the 2.7 blows up soon.

Good luck.

Subject: Type 993 wheels

More info on the new Type 993 wheels. I said earlier that they are cast, not
forged. This is only partly true. The center "star" section is cast, with
hollow spokes. The rims are still forged. The two components are friction
welded together, by spinning one component against the other.
 
This process also makes it easier to produce wheels of any width desired, as
it is no longer necessary to have a separate forging die or casting mold for
every single wheel size. One only needs an appropriate rim, to which a
"generic" center section is welded.
 
The design is also lighter than that of the old style rims.
 
The forged outer rim should allay the fears of those who intend to bounce
off things. <g>

I just put Steelcote EPO-121 (314-771-8053) on my garage floor.  It is used
for warehouses, airplane hangers, etc, and is impervious to about EVERYTHING,
and does not lift from rolling tires over it.  It cost about $2000 for 1500
square feet, including installation.  It is a three part epoxy system,
including a deep pentrating sealer, a high build intermediate coat and a top
coat.  I've had friends that use Zep (800-955-1580) with excellent results.
 I was going to use Zep, but the local distributor gave my contractor
problems.  All are available in a variety of colors; I chose light grey. If
you are going to get gas, oil, brake fluid, or antifreeze on your floor, the
tile or linoleum adhesive is NOT impervious to one or more of these liquids,
and depending on the tile, it may not be either.  The epoxy is.  In fact some
places use acetone to clean up the floor!

Hope this helps.

You COULD be INCREDIBLY lucky.  OR . . . .  I am often reminded of the 
old saying "if it seems to good to be true, it usually is."  Or "You get 
what you pay for."  However, this is MUCH too pessimistic.

Let's assume you can pull this off.  Find a Porsche mechanic to do a 
CAREFUL pre-purchase inspection.  Make sure its straight (a key).  Have 
engine compression and leakdown tests done (to see if its dying).  I had 
a 76 911S that turned out to be a nightmare.  (Hence my earlier 
pessimism).   Why is the guy selling?  How long has the car been on the 
market?  (If for a long time, at that price, there MUST be a reason.)

I hope it works out for you.  If the engine is original, but the car is 
straight and clean, figure $5000 - 6000 to drop a 3.x liter into it and 
you've got quite a deal.  (Check the tranny as well.)  If its been hit 
(look for re-painting - overspray under carpet in boot or around inside 
of doors, etc.) you're taking a bigger risk than you might think.  
Personally, because of my prior experience, I won't even pre-purchase a 
car if its been hit (even if the owner says its straight).  Just my own 
personal paranoia.

Good luck.  Let us know ow it turns out.

Subject: Re: Trail Braking

I don't disagree with what has been said before; however, IMO the dynamics
involved need a little more emphasis.  The Bob Bondourant School teaches a
simple approach to trail braking.  Basically, if your car were balanced 50/50
the tire contact patch would be equal size at all four corners.  With
straight line acceleration, the contact patch decreases for the front tires
and increases for the rear. With straight line breaking, the car's weight
shifts to the front to increase the size of the contact patch of the front
tires and maximize traction to the front. Trail braking is a transition from
straight line braking to acceleration out of the corner and serves to
increase the contact patch of the outside front tire and increase steering.

Implementation is easier said than done.  Straight line braking is done to
the limits of adhesion. You then gradually ease off the brakes as you add
more and more steering into the turn.  I asked Bob if this applied to
Porsches when I was there last year.  I hope that I am not misquoting.  He
implied that trail braking worked very well with Porsches.  I agree with most
of the other statements made.  I prefer to be slow in/fast out, which is
another tenant of the Bondourant School, and am very leary of applying the
brakes in the corners.  Maybe that's the reason I'm not very successful.

Hope this helps.

Subject: '84 944 Transmission Problems.

I'm hoping someone can help me out with the following problem on my '84 944
(68,000 miles). When in gear there seems to be a fair bit of driveline slack
in the drivetrain. This is most annoying in first gear, and then gets less
apparent as you move up through the gears. I have checked the cv joints, as
well as the tightness of the drivetube to the engine and trans. Unless I'm
completely on glue I figure it's one of the following in the trans:

1. Worn ring & pinion.

2. A differential problem.

If anyone has any ideas on this, please let me know. If I can fix this
problem myself then that would be great, but if I have to pay someone else to
do it, and if it's a major expense, would it be worthwhile to just get a
rebuilt trans and put that in the car? Any guidance would be greatly welcome.

Thanks.

This may be the ultimate rocket ship - the new twin-turbo 911. It has two
sequential turbos (a small one which spools-up quickly thus eliminating
turbo-lag, and a large one which takes over after initial acceleration).

The factory advertises the car at about 465 horspower (SAE), but they admit
it puts out around 485 hp on the dyno. It comes in a 993 body with a fixed
whale tail, has all-wheel drive, and 18" wheels.

Other than that, just your standard street car for around $110k.

Consumer's Reports also routinely ignores the "street" Yokohama tires,
and claims the A-008 series is the *WORST* tire you can buy. Be *DAMNED*
careful about assuming that they're right on any car-related things....
I mean, their "ultimate" car is the Camry!

When you eventually slide over to the business side of things, you discover
that people fall into three basic groups around how they decide to buy
things: performance-oriented, value-oriented, price-oriented.

Performance-oriented people want absolutely the best, don't care about
price, obsolesence, difficulty to use, etc. This is the core audience
that Porsche targets.

Price-oriented people want absolutely the best price and while they
also claim to want high-quality, will not pay more for something than
the lowest price they can find for an equivalent item (i.e. all tires
are the same -- round, black, hole in the middle, etc -- so what's the
diff between an AVS Intermediate and an Arizonian Sport Radial?)

Value-oriented people have certain "standards"  for both performance and
price, and want the best performance they can get within their price
range. Consumer Reports targets these people agressively. Unfortuantely,
the "max" range on the price side is set for people in the "family of four,
$45k a year" bracket. Hence, the difficulty I have in believing a whole
pile of their reviews, despite the fact I'm a member and everything...

On the wax front, I use Mother's paste wax. Great stuff. There are probably
better, but I like it...

OK, I am in need of some net suggestions.  I have recently upgraded my 77 911
to a 3.2 and up till this weekend everything was going fine.  This weekend I 
drove the car on a 1000 mile trip (500 one way).  On the first leg of the trip
I stopped for gas after about 6 hours of driving.  After filling up I tried to
start the car and nothing happened.  I had juice to open the sunroof, play the
radio hear all the buzzers etc., but not turn over.  After 10 minutes it just
started and I was on my way.  It started the rest of the weekend after short 
little jonts around town.  Then on the way home I stopped for gas (after about
6 hours of driving) and the same thing happened.  This time though, it didn't
start and I had to push start it (which it did thank goodness).  I tried it
again this morning and it would not even turn over (but had seemed to have
juice).  Oh yea, I tried to jump it at the gas station and that didn't work
either.  My first guess is the starter, but am willing to take any suggestions.
I haven't asked the mechanic that installed the engine yet, but would they use
my original starter from my 2.7 on this new 3.2?

Hi, Steve.
 
As I said, I'll call my former neighbor in Germany to find out about this. I
don't know about breakages from firsthand experience.
 
From a machine design standpoint, seven teeth on a gear is less desirable
than eight or nine or more, for strength reasons.
 
If one or two cars have gone a long time without breaking doesn't mean that
every car with the same amount of power will do just as well. Statistically,
some will break, some won't, some will go forever, some will break next
week. If the factory notices a trend to breakage, even if every test car
doesn't do it, they will avoid that situation.
 
I just called Jerry Woods, who did my 356 transmission, and is one of the
top people for Porsche transmissions and racing engines, and he says there is
no problem with 7:31. It was standard in the Type 915 box for some years (72
thru 75) and he recalls some racers even using 7:29. Checking specs, I think
1971 even used 7:27. The regular Carrera RS used 7:31.
 
I just checked the specs for the current U.S. turbo; they use 9:31. Back
when the Turbo still had only a 4-speed, 1988, they used a 9:38 pairing.
 
Clark Anderson says he has seen some 7:31 breakages, and when 356s were
using 6:whatever they would pull those teeth off the pinion too.
 
I just tried my former neighbor, it's 8 PM there, no answer.
 
(Friday) Finally got a hold of my former neighbor. He confirms that they had
problems with any 7-tooth pinion in extended service with high power. The
problem is related to the pressure distribution across the face
of each pinion tooth; 7-tooth pinions have a different pressure distribution
"footprint" than eight or more teeth.
 
Another thing to consider -- the load on the drivetrain is greatest in first
gear due to the torque multiplication effect of the gear sets. A car may be
developing 300 hp at the wheels in every gear, but the torque going through
the drivetrain downstream of the gears (which includes halfshafts and ring &
pinion) is generally reduced with every upshift. The torque at the flywheel
is unchanged. You can shear off dowel pins equally well in any gear, but it
becomes progressively more difficult to break things in the rear end as you
go up through the gears. If a car with 7:31 spends very little time in first
gear, such as maybe a track car that only uses it to come out of the pits
and runs on faster courses without hairpins, it just might have a longer
service life than a city-driven hot rod whose owner insists on flooring it
in first gear at every green light.
 
So the "experts" differ on this. Take your choice.
 
Pete

Subject: Carbon Brake Pads.


Hi Guys,

A quick one on the Carbon-Kevlar and Carbon Metallic brake pads. They 
work very well and perform as advertized.

The downside. They wear much faster than conventional pads, they dust 
*VERY* heavily when you really work them. This is a function of the 
higher friction temperatures they can generate. Cool brake ducting makes
them work even better. If you use wheels that have clear coat or a 
urethane-type coating, the high temperature particles will embed 
themselves into the paint, ruining the wheel finish. Polished wheels
fare better, but the carbon is very hard to remove. 

When cleaning the carbon residue off wheels, be sure to clean the INSIDE
of the wheel. This stuff can add enough mass to disturb the balance of 
the wheel. Do not use any caustic soda solutions or abrasive scrubbers 
as this makes the problem worse.

Check your pads daily at the track, as the pads wear a  bit faster than
regular metallics. (You should be doing this anyway).

Subject: plugs for 914/2.0


	What is the correct Bosch plug for use in a '74 914/2.0 ?

Different sources I have list different plugs, some as WR7DP and others 
as WR7CP. I am currently using the "C "plug and am getting a small 
amount of build up. I wanted to try the the hotter "D" plug to see
if it would eliminate this, or if a d-jet motor used on the street
just always gets some build-up. Ignition is a Bosch blue coil driven
by an MSD-6al. The build up is worse if I fire the ignition off the 
points directly.

	Looking at the "D" plugs, the ground electrode protrudes 
further (as a hotter plug should) and I am paranoid about the 
clearance. Since it is nearly impossible to measure the clearance
with the motor in the car, does anyone know what is is ? Will the
"D" plug come too close to my pistons ?

$180 sounds high, but not out of line for the dealer.   :-O  

I just paid $225 for a competition allignment and corner ballance.

Allignment: $135

Corner Ballance: $60/hr * 1.5hr

Having had one inept allignment by a local tire dealer, I'm a bit
picky about who works on the car.

The (inept) job left one rear wheel .75 degrees more negative than
the other.  Not really noticable under normal driving.  Get to 
about 80% - 85% braking and the more negative wheel locked up.

Probably cost me $300 in auto-x tires.

The current settings on my car are: -1.75 deg in front and -2.5 deg
in back.

The car *really* hooks up, even on street tires!

I expect that my street tire wear will be reduced a bit.

I also expect that my auto-x tires will wear better. 

I spend about $150-$200/yr on street tires and about $500-$600/yr 
on auto-x tires.  Go figure.  I just threw away a pair of rear 
tires that has 2+/32 tread on the inside and steel showing in at
least 6 places on the outside.

For the bay area folk who are going to ask, I've been going to 
Sportech in Campbell.  I've been happy with their work.

For the new auto-x-ers out there, allignment is one of the most
cost effective things to do to improve your times.  Run the most
negative camber you can (check the rules *first*) in your class.

I was really surprised at the difference 1 degree has made.

It sounds like the solenoid.

Find the starter.  

Wiggle the small wire attached to it, be sure there's a good 
connection.  This may fix it.  Otherwise...

The 911 starter works like this:

When you turn the key, power goes to the solenoid.

The solenoid (i) engauges the ring gear and (ii) energizes the 
starter motor.  In that order.

When I bought my 911 it did the same thing, except I could hear 
a "click" (not the click-click-click-click-click of a low battery)
but nothing else.

I removed the starter, removed the ring gear assembly, cleaned 
everything, lubricated everything, and put the starter back.

That was 4 years ago and everything still works fine.

The problem was the at the ring gear was sticking.  When the ring 
gear stuck, the starter motor never got power, so all I could hear
was a click when the solenoid tried to move the gear.

If you take it to a shop they'll just replace the whole thing 
because it's the most cost effective method for them.

Removing the starter is easy but you will need a 8mm (10mm?) 
allen socket and a 6" extension.

Warning:

**DISCONNECT THE NEGATIVE (GROUND) BATTERY TERMINAL BEFORE YOU START**

Otherwise you may short the battery and weld the ratchet to the car.
Replacing the ratchet will be the least of your worries at this point.

Porschephiles, HELP!

My '87 951 (70,000 Miles) has an AutoThority chip. Since this morning, there is 
a sudden loss of power under full boost. Average driving is unaffected. 
Temperature and oil pressure are as usual. When I kick the gaspedal down, boost 
goes to 2 Bar (as usually) and I wait for the power surge to come on. Instead, 
there is a sudden loss of power while no drop in boost pressure. When releasing 
the pedal, everything is unremarkable.
Anyone to direct me ? Could it just be "bad" (low octane) gas and cut-out via 
the knock sensor ? (I always use Amoco 93).

Any help is welcome, especially as I am relocating 1250 miles away in 2 weeks !

Subject: Re: 5.1K 911

I'm about ready to buy another 911 and I've been agonizing over what
kind to get.  

On one hand, there's a '72S (you actually CAN find them here in So 
Cal), but there's that $10K overhaul waiting for me every  100K to 
150K miles (and to replace the old 2.4 with a non-stock engine would 
be sacrilegious).  

On the other hand one can get an 80SC for about the same price (out 
here) as a '72S.  The down side is that they don't handle as well and 
are expensive to insure (about twice the cost of a 72S).

Gerald G. MacDonald <macdonag@mlc.lib.mi.us> says:

> If the [2.7 litre] engine is original, but the car is

This provides a third option.  I could buy a 73-77 911 and replace the 
engine with a 3.0 but I have a few questions.  

First, I've heard that one can get an SC engine  for around $3K.
Is this realistic?  How plentiful are the engines / where do I go to
get one?.  

Next, how hard is it to do the engine swap (can my mechanic do it with 
no problem or is there special machining that needs to be done)?  

And finally, is there anything else that I need to consider when doing 
this (e.g., resale value, smog legality, can the tranny handle the
increased torque of the 3.0)?


Thanks!

Also, a B&B catalog, and list of dyno specs is useful if you're

I've got an update on the following problem I posted almost a month
back:

>> Ok, I'm fairly stumped with this one.  I've got a 914 with stock
>> 1.7l fuel injection that has a little problem with cutting out under
>> hard throttle conditions.  

First, thanks to all the people that sent suggestions.  The big vote
winner was the head temp. sender, followed closely by the throttle
switch for a close second - among some others.  So, I changed the hts
and went to the next autocross.

After working my way through the problems first at an autocross, then
the better part of day one of the local time trial, I got down to
swapping out the coil that replaced another bad one (different
failures) and felt pretty sure I had it.  Ran all day on the second
day of the time trial without a problem.

Just to be sure, we (my co-driver and myself) ran the car _very_ hard
at this past weekend's San Diego Region PCA autocross.  With some
alignment/tire/brake changes/adjustments, I took the class for the
first time.  However, we've now got a nasty oil leak that pumps about
a quart while the motor is warming up - but more about that once I
start taking things apart. 8)

Thanks again for all the help, and I hope my adventure can help
someone else.

Trevor,

When you say slack, it really isn't clear what you mean.  If you mean that
there is some motion in the driveline that is taken up with a clunk or a
shudder, what you may have is a broken rubber center in your clutch disk.

Other than that, few 944s with 68K miles should have any play at all.

If you are not up to replacing your clutch (10 hours with fairly common
tools and about $500 in parts, assuming disk, pressure plate and t/o bearing
at the same time) I would suggest taking your car to a good mechanic that
you trust for a good diagnosis.

Thank you all who answered my question regarding the "944 driveline slack"
question. I agree that the clutch may be the problem, but I have not found
any chunks of rubber when looking through the clutch inspection hole. I also
performed a test where I removed the inspection cover at the front of the
trans. I noted that with the car out of gear (but the clutch engaged) there
was no movement at all. However, when the clutch was depressed and the trans
in gear, there is a fair amount of slack. The driveshaft moves about 1/4 turn
in first gear. The movement progressivly gets smaller until it only moves
slightly in fifth gear. With the car in gear and the clutch engaged, the
driveshaft does not move at all. Finally, this is not a new problem. I first
noticed this about 6 or 7 months ago, and it has not gotten any worse in that
period of time. I know, I know, I should have done something about this
months ago, but I am on a limited budget and therefore I am also a "Shadetree
mechanic". Since I live in Chicago, I'm not up for major repairs in Jan. or
Feb., so now that the weather is good I'll fix it, I promise.

I would avoid any options other than painting the floor - jack stands,

most non-paint options. Paint however is not paint. To avoid paint
peeling a specific set of materials must...must be used. Source for that
material is ZEP, 196 Manley St, Brockton, MA 617-583-2440 ask for Allan.
Tell him you need materials to paint your garage floor. He'll sell you
cleaning and acid etching chemicals, epoxy paint (first coat) and
urethane paint (second coat). The set-up is used to paint warehouse
floors - and fork lifts running around don't destroy it. My floor is
painted with this setup and has survived 7 years with no paint lifting.
The only material that destroys the paint is brake fluid (of course).

From personal experience, I'd stay away from the mid '70's 911S.  I had a

followed) was to try to get an 84 or better if possible to get the 
Carrera engine, among other things.  Folks pretty unanimously suggested 
going no earlier than an SC to avoid the many problems the earlier 
engines suffered.  I can tellyou the idfference between my 76 and my 84

I've heard good things about both and use both. In general, from what I'v heard,
the paste type wax will last longer than the liquid. The other thing you will
probably find is that it comes down to personal taste. I've seen this debate

They're around. Try the major salvage yards, etc. *BUT* the better thing
to do is go to a 3.2 with Motronic. One of the things I like about the 3.0s
is the CIS, which I actually understand how to modify for maximal performance
etc. (after all, pulsed injection simulates CIS under full load...)
However, even getting routine service for CIS is hard if things start going
bad, beacuse it's effectively black magic for most shops (sort of like the
D-jet injection on 1.7 and 2.0 914s...). Also, you can count on any system 
that is out of service and that has not been sealed (i.e. almost all
used systems that *YOU* didn't take out of a running car) to have serious 
problems either now or soon... 

The 3.2 will give you more power and puts you back in a spot that most
shops can service the car effectively. Not to mention less expensively
if things go bad.

> Next, how hard is it to do the engine swap (can my mechanic do it with

For either, the engine just bolts up to the transmission (on the 3.2 you
gotta use the right flywheel). Then you get to the fun stuff -- making the
electronics work... For the pre-lambda CIS motors, it's very straightforward
and only slightly less so for the lambda CIS guys. For the DME 3.2s, it's
harder, including making sure you get the wiring right for the tach...

Best bet is to have someone do this that's done it before, or that *CAN*
take the time to do it right.

The 915 tranny is fine for up to 300 HP with no problem, more than that
if you give it the right service.

All the CA smog stuff that I know about sez that you smog the car based
on newest of the engine or car. So you'd get smogged on the engine, which
(if it's OK) should pass with no problem. If you use a CIS system, and
you have problems with the HC component, getting it fixed is hard, but
you might be able to slide by on the "too expensive to fix" clause.

Resale value, well, you may or may not get your money back out of the deal.
Your best bet to make it work financially is to buy a car with a known
bad engine and pay $5-6k for it, then do the engine swap. If you pay top
dollar for a car, then you'll never get your money back.

Regarding B&B Catalog and Exhaust Dyno Sheets:

I am not knocking B&B or anything, but I would not believe
Dyno figures from B&B on B&B products. Nor would I believe
any aftermarket chip companies dyno sheets either.

The only way to find performance products that work is to talk
people that actually have gone through the process of finding
the correct performance products. These people are hard to find.

Also be careful about groups of companies that promote each
others products. For example, there is this cliche of companies
in Arizona that all promote B&B exhaust systems (also in Arizona).

I am not saying the product does not work as advertised, but find
independant source that knows what they are talking about before
you believe what you read.

Autothority claims 20% gains in horsepower and tirque with their
Mass-Flow sensor. Well, no one I know with a dyno has seen these
kinds of gains. No one I know that has installed has seen 20%
improvement in torque or horsepower. They have seen a good
improvement in throttle response.

Autothority now has a Mass-Flow/Exhaust package that uses B&B
headers and mufflers. Guess what? All these companies in AZ say
this is the hot ticket. Surprised?

I've been to many POC and PCA AX and track events now. The fast
cars do not have these products installed. Why? Maybe because
they do not live up to their advertising.

I recommend that you find a good (no, great) performance Porsche
person and listen to what he has to say. He has probably tried
everything you might think to try and will know what works best.
He may be slow to try new fangled perfromance add-ons (for good
reason), but he will not recommend products that do not work so
he can make a quick buck. He is in it for the long haul and a
good reputation is worth more that a quick few dollars.

Well, off my soap box for now.....

I recommend this option.  You have the handling characteristics of a pre

Dunno, I paid $4,500 for my 3.0sc engine (a good one) with 150K miles, 
plus $800 to install.

Smog in CA is a weird issue with '77 body, and '78 engine.  I had no 
problem, mechanic just assumed '77.  However, have heard that it goes by 
a) referee when engine year and body year don't match, or by b) body 
year, or c) engine year.

Take your pick.  If you're in No. Cal. I can tell you a couple places to 
avoid (Rockwell Motor Sports and 'Quality' Tune Up) and one to recommend, 
Chevron station on Park Victoria and Landess for fair honest smog check.

Check out the bypass valve located on the rubber pipe from the

This valve releases boost when the throttle is released under boost to avoid

The loss of boost due to low octane usually only happens when the car is warm
and it's hot out and can be reset by breifly turning the key off while lifting

Porschephiles, HELP!

My '87 951 (70,000 Miles) has an AutoThority chip. Since this morning, there is 
a sudden loss of power under full boost. Average driving is unaffected. 
Temperature and oil pressure are as usual. When I kick the gaspedal down, boost 
goes to 2 Bar (as usually) and I wait for the power surge to come on. Instead, 
there is a sudden loss of power while no drop in boost pressure. When releasing 
the pedal, everything is unremarkable.
Anyone to direct me ? Could it just be "bad" (low octane) gas and cut-out via 
the knock sensor ? (I always use Amoco 93).

Any help is welcome, especially as I am relocating 1250 miles away in 2 weeks !

Depending on what you are going to do to your car, I wouldn't write off 
Haynes manuals. For a novice I'd much rather recommend it than an expensive 
huge Workshop manual. But after a while, you may want the Workshop manuals, 
then the Haynes manual was the right choice, as they triggered your interest

need for the officials.(Haynes Manuals is just $15 too ;)

Ted,

What exactly do you mean here?  Have you ever raced your car against SCs
and newer Carreras?  What handling advantages did you have over them?
I'd like to know because my '76 has to work its butt off to keep up with those
guys.  I think you may be placing too much emphasis on the miniscule
weight advantage the pre-'78 cars may have.  Also, I would suggest you have
your car weighed, because the addition of a 3.0l engine didn't do anything
to *lighten* your car.  Seems to me that the only place your car is measurably
lighter than an SC is in the small amount of sheet metal for the rear flares.

Your statements don't have much credibility without some sort of logic to back
them up.

Well, I just paid $140 yesterday at an independent shop for my alignment.
A quote from a second shop was $120.

** BUT ** it ended up costing me $140 + $200!! The shop said the front
end could not be brought within specs using the usual alignment methods.
(I believe there was way too much negative camber, don't have the paperwork
in front of me now though.) The $200 was to "de-arch the front struts".
Was this legit? I seem to recall that age or metal fatigue can cause
this to happen. OR, did I get ripped off? :-( The car is an 85 Carrera
with 105K miles.

BTW, the car now drives like a different car - much nicer! I had purchased
the car 1 year ago. The steering has always felt heavy. Thought it was the
nature of the car. WRONG! Now it take about half the effort to turn the
car. My tires are happier too.

off a 944S2.   Anyone knows what price range these wheels are when new? I'm 
interested in these as a second set of wheels. I assume these will fit my '87 
951 with the 52mm offset?  Anyone familiar with these wheels - are they 
forged?  Are they OK for high-speed track events? 

TIA,

OK, I am in need of some net suggestions.  I have recently upgraded my 77 911 
to a 3.2 and up till this weekend everything was going fine.  This weekend I 
drove the car on a 1000 mile trip (500 one way).  On the first leg of the trip 
I stopped for gas after about 6 hours of driving.  After filling up I tried to 
start the car and nothing happened.  I had juice to open the sunroof, play the 
radio hear all the buzzers etc., but not turn over.  After 10 minutes it just 
started and I was on my way.  It started the rest of the weekend after short 
little jonts around town.  Then on the way home I stopped for gas (after about 
6 hours of driving) and the same thing happened.  This time though, it didn't 
start and I had to push start it (which it did thank goodness).  I tried it 
again this morning and it would not even turn over (but had seemed to have 
juice).  Oh yea, I tried to jump it at the gas station and that didn't work 
either.  My first guess is the starter, but am willing to take any suggestions. 
I haven't asked the mechanic that installed the engine yet, but would they use 
my original starter from my 2.7 on this new 3.2?

     You can solve all your problems with the tilton starter replacement.  
     Costs about 3 RCU (race car unit...1 RCU=$100) and works great.  I 
     think there is also an upgraded 1.5 HP Porsche starter.

Can someone give some more details on the difference between handling of
pre SC 911s and SC+ 911s.  I've always been of the impression that newer
911s handled better than older 911s.

Subject: Resetting computer by disconnecting battery


If memory serves me right, I think my 1990's owners manual mention something 
about taking approximately 10 minutes(?) of running time before everything is 
"reset" right if the battery was previously disconnected.  In other words, if 
I disconnect the battery and then re-connect the battery, I have to run the 
car for a few minutes to ensure the "computer readjust" to the what the 
correct settings should be under the "new" conditions (or changes).

Again, I'm just a "wanna be mechanic" and don't really know exactly what or 
why--I'm just voicing my opinion and what the owners manual says.  But I've 
never had any problems re-connecting my battery and just driving off into the 
"wild blue yonders".

I do routinely disconnect my battery to save the battery since I don't get a 
chance to drive it as *routinely* as I would like.  Here in the BIG city of 
S.F., public transit is very good and the parking bad :-(

Hallo philers, a few weeks ago I met a guy who's
got a 930 in mint condition, RUF camshaft's and
other stuff, approx 375hp. He had some papers
from a canadian company selling 4 valve head's to
Porsche 911/930 ! The 930 would get 482hp with them,
using the original camshaft's ! They were priced
10k/pair. Anyone on the list who knows anything

Does anyone have similar lists for other years?  I thought someone said they

Subject: Good Reference: Porsche Parts Catalogs

For random not-engine repairs, like making the windows work right,
and tightening windshield wipers, etc, the best thing I found was:

    the Porsche factory parts catalog.
  
It is not a workbook in any sense: just "exploded" parts diagrams
with every part numbered and briefly described.

But its just the ticket when you can't remove the windshield 
wiper motor even though you know you've removed both of the bolts,
and then you see "4mm bolts, three" :-)

You can buy the parts catalogs from Stoddards ...

With all this talk of rocket ships....

Is this twin-turbo 993 available yet? What is the model designation (not
911 turbo, but the factory number)?

Also, has anyone had any experiences or heard about ordering a car direct
from Porsche with greater than stock power? A lot of souped-up factory
Porsches exist in Japan. I wonder if they can do this for a US car.

As someone has said before, I really doubt that you can have >700 hp in a
911 while maintaining streetability and reliability. The only car I know
that can do this is a 550 hp Nissan Skyline GT-R. Well, I guess a 500-600
hp 911 is okay, but not more.

    To clarify, the 356SC engine is not a bug engine.  I'm not sure what
exactly the diffs are, but I do know that they're expensive!  ;-)
    The 1976 (only?) 912E used the VW Type IV 2-liter 914 engine that
they had sitting around at the Factory, with the L-Jetronic FI off the
1.8L 914s.

advantages: less weight, lower COG, 195/50 tires on 16" wheels yields a 
much lower car than a stock sc or carerra, and the narrow pre-wide butt 
body, make's it more aerodynamic.

Subject: Do 944's normally run this hot?

I purchased an 83 944 about a month ago, and one of the first things I
noticed about the car is that the coolant temp rises even if I'm moving
at 25-35mph until the fans kick on, and then it cools down pretty quickly.
Is this normal or do I have a problem with airflow to the radiator?
At highway speeds, the gauge remains pretty much in the middle.  Should
I think about a lower thermostat?  (BTW, A/C was not on)

Should I have Carrera Tensioners put in my '81 911SC?                          
     
My 911's exhaust was sounding kind of strange as of late... sort of like it was 
going bad.  I took it in to trusty Bob Farmer (a very good mechanic in the     
midwest, BTW)  Woes me!  It was actually two broken headbolts.  I guess that   
doesn't speak very highly of my mechanical aptitude :-(.   I'm looking at about 
$1800 to get it fixed.  Anyway, my question is since they'll have the thing    
torn apart, what do you folks think- should I have the tensioners replaced with 
the *better?* carrera tensioners?  What's the going $$$ to replace tensioners? 
Thanks,

     Yes, you should.  When I had the same headbolt problem on my 79SC, I 
     put in Carrera Tensioners and never had a lick of trouble with them. 
     Everything will be apart anyway, you will save labor if you do it now.

True, but they use a lot of non-porsche products, either porsche may not 
make them, or others may just make them better.  e.g. most custom race 
porsches use BBS wheels, anyone see the factory wheels flying off the 
Supercars in race #1 wheels were coming off, in race #2, a rim broke off 
the center hub!  However, I believe these are 18" wheels, and not many 
people make this size yet.

BTW, how do they ensure all the cars are equal?  How is Nick Ham doing in 
races past #2?  How does one get to race in these besides buying a car?

Where can I send him my racing suggestions?

Paul Andrus asked about compressor-powered buffers.
 
Hi, Paul.
 
Yes, there are definitely air-powered buffers available. You can start with
an El Cheapo Chinese-made dual-action sander, which the discount houses may
have for $20 or $30, and put stick-on foam pads on that, or go all the way
up to the dual-head polishers or roller polishers used by the aircraft
industry for several hundred dollars. You should order the USATCO catalog
(U.S. Air Tool Co.), Gardena, CA, 1-310-323-1953, fax 329-8275. Their
"Cyclo Aero Polisher" can be ordered with pneumatic or electric drive. I
don't have any prices.
 
I use a variable-speed Hitachi electric grinder, model SP18V, on its lowest
speed, 1400 rpm, with Meguiar's foam or wool pads as appropriate. This thing
is electronically governed, and has been a real workhorse for polishing as
well as heavy-duty steel grinding. A quality sander/polisher of this type
will cost well over $100.
 
Meguiar's and other high-end pads are your best bet. They have decent
fittings or are attached by heavy duty velcro-like stuff, and therefore easy
to change for different polishing steps.

There's been a lot of talk about Zymol lately. I figure wax is like motor
oil, more an article of religious faith than objective reasoning, but I can
relate my one and only experience with Zymol. This is as a corporate entity,
not a product. The owner of Zymol was hanging around the Brumos Racing team
a couple of years ago at Del Mar, for the IMSA season finale. (You get to do
that when you pay them to put your sticker on their car). After qualifying,
this ridiculous little guy in Bermudas insisted on WAXING THE BLEEDING
HEADLIGHTS because, as he put it, "I want to give these guys every possible
advantage." Nobody said anything, but there were a few amused glances among
the team mechanics.
 
If Hans Stuck wins races because his headlights are slicker than anybody
else's, it's time for all of us to find another hobby.
 
What wax do I use? I happen to have a big box full of Meguiar's, but it
could just as easily be 3M. Either product works like this: 1) Spend hours
rubbing out the paint ("deep cleaning"). 2) Spend about an hour with the
swirl remover. 3) Apply glaze or, in the latest case, their "Medallion"
wax. 4) Wait several weeks for birds to shit on it etc. 5) Start again. This
is the first time in 3+ years I've waxed the daily driver 356; in the past I
just used a wool pad with medium-cut cleaner to get the junk off the
surface, and left it like that. Yeah, now it looks good (for a while) but
there are other things to do in life. If you're lucky, you can do those other
things and hire a flunky to wax your cars for you. (OK, so now they're
called "detailers" and they make more money). But it's not "time well spent"
for rational minds.
 
I plan to take the car out to Mrs. Orcutt's Driveway to measure top speed
with and without the headlights waxed. <g>

Subject: Water-emulsified gasoline/diesel fuel


To Pete Albrecht, re your message of June 23rd:
- --------------------------------------------- 

Water-emulsified fuels may not reduce emissions, as you found in your
Master's thesis, but they improve thermal efficiency, translated  to miles
per gallon, in all fuel-injected engines. This because liquids take
relatively little work to compress, steam gives a lot of expansion work in
return. 

Practical Proofs: In steam power plants the feed pump uses about 2% of the
power produced by the steam turbine. In contrast, in gas turbine plants
compressors take about 70% of the turbine work. Piston engine numbers for
compression and expansion are similar to those of gas turbines. Thus,
whenever you inject water in a piston engine, I would expect an efficiency
and perhaps power output improvement. Newcastle Upon Tyne University in
the UK had a research project in the early 1980s on water-emulsified
diesels, for marine propulsion, and realized 5% efficiency improvements.
(My family could live handsomely off the 5% savings from the fuel bill of
a large oil tanker!). Incidentally, the distilled water used in the tests
worked out fine, but the bacteria in the local water multiplied in
the diesel fuel and started attacking the metal of the engines of the
Northumbria buses, where the idea was first tried. The problem was solved
with additives, but by then interest in the project had diminished.

Subject: 911 Engine opinions wanted (longish sorry!)

Help!  I need some advice / words of wisdom from those more knowledgable
than I.

I purchased an '82 911 SC Targa (leather seats, 16" wheels, cruise, a/c,
whale tail) with 68k miles on it a month ago.  The car is beautiful
cosmetically with the exception of some stitching coming undone on the
passenger seat.  I purchased the car for $12,000 with the knowledge that
it needed some exhaust and other misc. work.  I estimated that it needed
about $2-3,000, roughly verified by a pre-purchase inspection.

I now have $15,800 in it including:
$2,500  new cat cvtr, muffler, O2 sensor, misc. hardware and
        fuel inj adjustments
   100  New brake pads all around
   110  New clutch cable
   100  New plugs, air filter, oil and misc.
   200  New dist. cap, rotor and ignition wires
   790  Taxes, registration, misc. admin stuff etc

Now the burn.  I had the cam covers off to do valve adjustments last
weekend.  They had not been off for many miles !  When I pulled off the
left side exhaust cover what should fall out but a bloody great nut and
washer attached to about 4" of tie rod.

I've talked to a couple of shops and am told it'll be about $1,200 to
drop the engine, pull the jugs and replace the one rod and reinstall.
One shop however says approx. $1,500 to completely top overhaul the engine
including replacing all the exhaust side studs with "Delevar" (sp?).

My questions:
Lets say it really takes $1,700 to top the engine.  Then I'll have $17,500
in an '82 Targa.  Admittedly it'll be a car with new exhaust, a fresh top,
new ign. components, brakes etc. Could I sell the car for that ?  Am I
going to be in to it for too much ?

Is it worthwhile topping the engine ?  Is 1,500-1,700 a good price
(this includes upgrading to hydraulic chain tensioners) ?  What should
I look out for ?

How easy would it be for me to 1) Drop the engine and just replace the
stud myself, or 2) Top the engine myself.  I've some air-cooled
engine experience (I've pulled jugs off my airplane before and other
misc. engine work) but not much Porsche experience.  I understand it
can be quite a trick to get the cam timing correct.  My father who
has agreed to help should it be needed has considerable engine rebuilding
experience, but again it's aircraft engines.  I'm guessing a month of
weekends to top it myself - a reasonable estimate ?

I know this is going to be controversial but ... what performance mods
can I do at top overhaul time that are worth the $$ ? (I'm finding the
car a little under powered - grin, grin).

that they don't last long at all. I've had sets that lasted about 10K miles
max, and even one that leaked all it's fluid when it was adjusted new.
(replaced under warrantee). Anyway, 90K miles is definately longer than they
should last, even under highway use. You might prefer Bilstein shocks, they
ride smoother (nose of the light 911 does not "bob" as much). They should
also last longer.
The Koni adjustment is only for rebound (pulling out) and will not
help if your shocks are really worn out.

I have to ask, do you think a later model will run that long without needing
AT LEAST $10K in repair? Some early S parts are expensive and hard to find,
but I don't think there is that much of a difference. Also consider the
resale value- the '72S should be worth substantially more than an SC in
several years, so the extra maintenance should be offset by an increase in
value.

Subject: Alternative fuels and electric cars


The recent discussion on battery-powered 356s and 914s for adults, and on 
alternative fuels, perked up my interest again.
Below is an updated version of my $0.02 I sent to the list on March 8th, 
but it was burried in a larger message, thus probably missed by most.

Wind, tidal, geothermal and solar ``energy'' are some of the technologies
promising MECHANICAL WORK or its rate MECHANICAL POWER at significantly
reduced emissions, albeit at some cost. A solar car will be interesting
when it can suck the doors off a 930. Until then, personally, I like the
|8-)   SMILES PER GALLON    ======:-) provided by my gasoline-fueled
P-cars. To balance this, I keep my home at 70-72 deg in the winter,       
78-80 deg in the summer (instead of the opposite, as is usual in
government buildings), and I will vote against every ``green'' zealot. 

At Washington University students have converted a Corsica to run on M85
(85% methanol, burns without visible flame and  15% other combustibles
that burn with visible flame). A local automotive company provided us with
some research-stage  fuel-system parts, but they couldn't make them last
more than 10,000 miles (ours last even less). Methanol- and ethanol-fueled
engines can be tweeked to burn with less CO and NOx, but they produce
formaldehydes, a carcinogen that's not regulated, but will do the usual
other damage. (Some will argue that ethanol doesn't produce formaldehydes,
but they are in the same category with cigarette manufacturers claiming
that cigarette smoking does not cause lung cancer). Methanol and ethanol
also have severe cold-starting problems. Our students have also converted
a GMC truck to run on compressed natural gas (CNG). CNG burns hotter than
gasoline, but with water injection that can be reduced. We just returned
from the 1994 Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Challenge, for which  we
converted an Escort to run some time on a small gasoline engine, some time
on batteries.  But where does the electricity come from? From the power
plants, either  nuclear or coal-burning or oil-burning; each has a
pollution problem of its own. And for the ultimate hydrogen-powered car?
Well, how do you generate hydrogen? Sometime as a byproduct of generating
other chemicals in chemical plants with emission problems of their own;
sometimes by electrolysis, which needs electric-power input, and we are
back to the electric power plant emissions.....
 
Although I do these ``alternative energy'' projects as part of student
education, I also fully understand that they are the car-manufacturer's

I've seen their adds in either Excellence or Pano (or maybe
both), but know nothing specific about them.  I do know that
*all* Porsche 4-valve heads are water cooled.  The 959 and
perhaps the 962 used water cooled heads.  Hans Metzer,
head of engine development at Porsche, is quoted in an
interview in the current Excellence as saying that they were
unable to develop an air-cooled 4-valve head with satisfactory
cooling properties.  If the factory couldn't do it, I would be
skeptical of an aftermarket version.  It may in fact produce
lots of power, for a while...

Subject: Very Cheap Insurance 

Philes

I was at a local exotic/classic car dealer this last weekend to get an
appraisal done for my '73 S.  The owner told me about a company called
JC Taylor advertised in Hemmings.  He said if I don't plan on driving the
car more than about 2500miles/year that they would insure it for 70cents per
$100 of worth.  So if I state that the car is worth $10,000, I would pay
only 70 bucks per year plus I think around 15 bucks extra for personal
liability.  

Does anyone have their Porsche insured through this company?  Anyone ever
made claims with this company?  The dealer says theyve been in business
for quite a while and he's never heard anything bad about them, although
he's never tried to make a claim either.

In truth, this is an "it depends" question. For instance, we built
an IMSA GTU car on a '68 tub and no one would question that it out
handles the average street 911 of any vintage...

However, the broad generalization is that the older cars handle more
like 356s -- lots of innate oversteer, heavy lift-throttle oversteer,
etc. -- and the new cars handle more evenly and are much less likely
to swap ends "without warning".  The pre-69 "short wheelbase" cars are
particularly bad about this, since they have a low polar moment of
inertia in addition to a bad front/rear weight distribution...

For my money, they're all pretty much the same, you just have to use 
different driving styles to accommodate the combination of car, modifications 
to suspension, and tires you're using. Part of the challenge *SHOULD*
be trying to become the best driver possible in the car you have instead
of seeking out a "magic bullet" solution that makes it possible for
you to beat better drivers in less able cars.

There are *DAMN* few nationally competitive drivers (as opposed to national 
competitors) on this list -- or anywhere, for that matter. Until you're
really in that league, there's still a ton of driver improvement before
you need to worry about this stuff...

Oh -- there *IS* an exception: if you're basicly a "sunday driver" 
that wants a Porsche 911, then *ABSOLUTELY* get the newest car you can
as it's much less likely to "surprise" you!!!

Subject: 911 performance

        Reply to:   911 performance
Most everyone will agree that the early 911's (especially the longer
wheelbase '69-on), with their light weight and peppy performance,
were/are fun to drive.  Their light, crisp steering makes them very
tossable.  And the lack of heavy medicine in the brakes and steering
system was the right recipe.  Just pure fun.  Reminds us old timers
what sports cars were originally about and why Porsches were
always among the best.

As 911's got older they got heavier for safety and comfort reasons.
And clean air laws required smog controls that hurt performance.
Too bad.  The good news is that over time Porsche released better
performing, more reliable cars (with a couple of exceptions like the
77 911 and California 74-76 911 engines which had reliability and
longevity problems).  Performance, measured in terms of acceleration,
top speed, braking, and skid pad tests got better all the time.  This is
still true today (who doesn't lust for a 993?).

Also, over time some of the handling traits so characteristic of 911's
got tamed (e.g., inside front wheel lift and tail wagging).  Whether
this is good or bad depends on your perspective.  Most of us (including
Porsche AG) felt it was an improvement.

I think it is fair to say that, from a factory-delivered point of view,
the performance of later 911's is "better" than those of earlier years
- -- in acceleration, handling, braking, etc.  This is as it should be.
Every car maker has made big strides here and Porsche is no
different.  (Sorry, Ted.)

But from a nostalgia perspective, the old 911's are the favorites of
many of us.  If I could buy a 72 911S today that is as solid and trouble-
free as an SC or a Carrera I'd do it in a moment.

Subject: Turbo & Boost questions

Dear Porschephiles,

Since I am having a problem at peak boost on my 951, several questions came to 
mind as to the basic functions of turbo and boost controls:

1. What determines the boost level at different RPM's and engine loads ?
	Is it the boost bypass valve ?
2. What determines maximum boost ? The wastegate ?

I see different scenarios: during average driving, boost levels are between 0.4 
and 1.0 bar. This is below maximum boost. Is this the level controlled by the 
bypass valve ? However, when you kick down the pedal, maximum boost (2 bar) is 
obtained. Is this determined by the wastegate ??

My problem occurs at kick down only: maximal boost is reached and the engine 
cuts out. It appears as if I am getting too much boost and the engine is cutting 
out (is this a fuel or spark plug cut-out ?)

Hope I am not offending anyone by my naive questions but I have not been able to 
find a coherent answer.

Thanks, Bart

I'd like to ask advice on how to correctly align my headlights and

Anyways, could someone please summarize the correct procedure for aligning

Subject: Water pump - to fix or not to fix

My '87 944S leaks about 10 drops of coolant every time I park it.  This
just started happening since I had the cam & balance shaft belts & rollers
replaced, and I'm assuming the problem is the water pump. The mechanic had
diagnosed the water pump as o.k. when installing the belts, but apparently
something is causing it problems since then.

Since I _just_ paid for all the labor to replace the belts, should I go
ahead and do it again for the water pump? Can I delay this expense by
simply topping off the coolant? Or do I run the risk of the leaking coolant
eating away at things that should not be eaten away?

Your advice is appreciated.

Subject: RE: 951 cutout at high boost


To Bart

I believe your coutout at high boost is a waste gate or the control
valve or posibly just a loose hose.

If the Turbo produces excessive boost and the waste gate does not
bleed it off the DME shuts off the fuel and you slap up
against the windshield.

Check the following very carefully
1	Hoses to wastegate, control valve, manifold, ect..
		disconnected, loose, split out
2	Check that the control hose that connects
	to metal air tube from turbo-intercooler is not pluged
	disconnected ect..
3	cracked or broken nipples on  control valve (common)
		diefective control valve or wires loose ect.
	broken nipples can be replaced with brass tube.
4	stuck wastegate (uncommon)
		
control valve is benith intake manifold toward rear of engine
and is dificult to see.  three hosses attatch and a set of
two wires go to it.

List of contents of the ktud13.elte.hu anonymous ftp site. Latest
update: 21th of June 1994.
(the new things are marked with a *)

General intro:
This site carrying pictures about limited edition cars, specialty
cars (kitcars, replicars, exotic sportscars etc.), radically
modified cars, coachbuilt production cars. I will store off-line
the JPGs in TIF format (whenever I could do...) so you can ask
for it.

The structure of the ftp site is as the following:
pub/pictures: the pix
* pub/pictures/vintage.racers: pre-WWII American racers (midgets
etc.) (this is currently under uploading)

pub/txt: the descriptions of the pictures
pub/viewers: some picture-viewer
pub/faqs: picture-related faqs
pub/incoming: the uploaded things.

Only TIFF and TARGA - or any other truecolor, not compressed in
a lossy way - pictures are acceptable for uploading! 
Or if you only have GIFs I can deal with them but it's only the
latest thing which I dig.
The pictures are published in JPG format, but we should have it
in the original truecolor not lossy compressed format! Of course,
there are always special cases, but please do not bomb me with
such letters that I'd like to upload a JPG of my beautiful VW
Golf! 
(If it is a Sbarro Golf - go ahead!). Well, we're interested in
_rare_ production cars e.g. 1953 Chevy Corvette, 1964 Ford
Mustang owners etc.  If you'd like to upload sg. you should write
an
E-mail to 

PAUL@KTUD.ELTE.HU (he is the maintainer of the site)

and if he is interested in that picture, he'll write you the way
of uploading. 
(*BTW it's very simple: ftp to ktud13.elte.hu login: anonymous
password: e-mail address, cd incoming and you can upload)
  Please upload some description of the car as detailed as it is
possible! (History, technical specifications, etc.). If you think
you have an interesting car but you don't have a scanner please
drop me a line (ya know Paul@ktud.elte.hu) and we will discuss
it and if it's worth we'd be happy to scan it.

All the copyright problems will be sent back to the uploader. We
can't be responsible for any (c) problems! 
This site is NOT:
1. A general picture site. (No sex, garfield, etc. junk
pictures!!!!)
2. We are not interested in pictures scanned from books,
brochures, etc.
  We tryin' to avoid that kinda pix...

We'll try to keep up-to-date things like QPEG, JPG FAQ and such.

And maybe there will be a FAQ of cars-related stuff on the net
(mailing lists, WWWs, pic-sites etc.) (it's under construction
now).

As it was previously stated: this site is experimental. The .txt
files which  belong to various pictures are under development,
they will contain more info from time to time.

*  Thanx for reading this and we'd be very happy to hear your  
   comments,

                  The pictures 
(the .jpg files can found under the pub/pictures directory, the
.txt files 
can found under the pub/txt directory).

* Latest additions:
       a new directory: pub/pictures/vintage.racers:
currently there is only one picture about a Willys-powered Midget
but there will be more, just take a look to the vinrace.txt)
       Guitolar (guitola1,2,3,4,5,6.jpg): pictorial history of
an Uruguayian car-maker.
       In the near future (maybe this or the next week) there
will be texts to the 59hearse.jpg and the to the 60hearse1,2,

Any Europorschephiles going to the PCGB Meet 1994
at Donnington? It is on the second and third of July.

Saturday will be a track day for interested parties,
plus practice for the Pirelli Production championship.
Sunday will be the Concours, autojumble, trade show
and racing.

This is a must for those who love fine motor cars. Last
year there was a Porsche traffic jam back on to the 
motorway so get there early.

All Porsche parking is in a great position right outside 
the Main exhibition hall, and is classified by model and 
model year. Other rolling objects get to park at a suitably
repectful distance from the massed ranks of German metal, 
in a specially muddy field if last year is anything to go by.

Well, I'm officially a Northern New Jersey PCA member, so I don't even
get the Houston newsletter. I typically have *NO* idea what's going
on around here...

Ghost Racing had the annual cookout this last weekend, and while there
were a pile of 914 owners, that's not open to the general public.

I'll check and see if there's anything else going on this summer. I'd
bet there is. I also know that the PCA region in Corpus Christi has
about 80% of the members at 914 owners/drivers, and that they're talked
about having a 914 reunion or some such...

My Dad has JC Taylor insurance on his '37 Chevy. As I recall (which is scary
in its own right : )), the key point is that their insurance requires club
membership and use of the vehicle only in club sponsored events.  They don't
cover racing or commuting (or racing while commuting : )).  Your car is only
covered while sitting in the garage, on tours, in the local 4th of July
parade, or to and from the local mechanic. It seems that there is also an
exclusion from coverage for damage/loss to the car *at* a restoration
facility.

Does this jive with other porschephilers' understanding?

Yeah, the nuclear plant I used to work at had the floors (and even the

I think.  Great stuff.  Even those pesky nuclear accidents didn't phase it.

Also, my apologies to the faithful for the transposition of the "6" and the

I'll get him for that one.

Subject: Re: Very Cheap Insurance

I have a '67 Corvette that I tired to insure thru some of the advertisers
in HMN without luck.  They were all willing to insure the car for a
reasonable rate, but I really wasn't allowed to drive it.  The two
common stipulations were:

	1.  can't drive it for any business purpose.  We drive the
		Corvette in fair weather year round including to and
		from work on occasion.  This wouldn't work for us.

	2.  can't leave the car unattended.  This was to the level
		that I couldn't drive the car to a restaurant and 
		have dinner becuase the car would be "unattended".

Neither of the 3 folks I talked to outright said you can't drive the
car, but the conditions made the car undrivable for our purposes.  
Also, on the application you had to sign a statement that summaraized
these limitations.  Not much room to claim ignorance later on.....

When I asked them about the what if's (like what if I drive it and
had to make a claim) one said they might pay and then cancel, the other
said they would probably just cancel.  These firms seem more suited to
people with LOTS of cars or more pure antique or show cars.

I go thru my local State Farm agent that I've been with for years.  I
have the Corvette insured as a Classic with limited mileage and an
appraised value considerably over $10K for about $370 a year.  The
use is supposed to be very limited, but they understand occasional
driving, and I didn't have to sign anything that said I wouldn't
drive it under certain conditions.

I also insure our '70 911T thru State Farm for about $320 a year.  It
is insured as a second car, also with 7500 mileage.  I have the value
stated as $6500.

We have all the good driver, accident free, multiple car blah blah blah
discounts, plus I have $500 deductible on all cars (we have 5 insured
thru them).

I think you're in the same area as I am, if you'd like to talk to my
agent let me know.  Can't hurt.

No, Ted the English is fine. It's just a different language from American.

I like Haynes because unlike some other books they don't assume that 
anything beyond changing sparkplugs is beyond the scope of the home
mechanic. On the other hand, the new manuals aren't as good as they
used to be. Often times the European car models are covered well, but our
U.S. emissions and F.I. sections are covered poorly, or even incorrectly
as in the case of my Volvo lambda sond info.

I've found that if I get Haynes, Chilton and Clymer one of the three will
have a picture, one of the three will have a text description and two
of the three (majority rules) will have the correct repair sequence.
For correct *data* such as torque figures, the little Porsche Technical
Specifications Books are the best. If you can afford them, the shop manuals
are really great.

Bottom line IMHO is that you can't have too many books. Sometimes a 
single photo is worth the price of the book (like for that oddball
vacuum hose that doesn't have a place to connect) - And you can put
together a pretty good little library for say, the cost of a set of
painted hub covers.

This is confusing to me.  On my '87 951, maximum boost on the gauge is ~1.4 
bar.  Is 2 bar the max because your car is chipped?  What is the *stock* max 
boost?  Even if chipped, 2 bar sounds awfully high, increasing the risk of 
blown head gaskets.  I thought chipped cars peaked at ~1.8.  Just curious, 
since one day I'll get around to chipping my car (i.e. after new wheels,

Subject: re; 3.0 liter in '77 911s


      If Thermal reactors were the death of the 2.7l, then the years to
     be wary of are '76 and '77 ('74/75 didn't have them). Dilivar studs
     were put on the exhaust side (by the factory)  sometime in '77, however
     with the thermal reactors even full dilivars are NOT ENOUGH. Anybody
     with this "lost in the 70's EPA engineering" needs to take them off as
     a favor to both the car and the environment.  
      The bigger displacement is often cited for the 2.7's woes, but the 
     earlier 2.4S generated more power and you don't hear as many
     complaints about those.
      Porsches get better year by year; the SCs are better than the midyear
     911s and the Carreras better still in terms of comfort, reliability, and
     handling.  But replacing a healthy 2.7 with a 3.0 doesn't make sense if
     your only concern is drivability. The aluminum-case 3.x is more reliable
     but (as this net attests) not immune from broken studs, oil leaks, etc.
     But also the economy doesn't add up; with SCs available at $10k, it just
     doesn't make sense to buy a mid-year car, spend another $4k to put in a  
     used motor and still have a lesser car. 

       If you want to have a reliable 911 for under $6k buy your $5100        
     bargain and;
         1. remove the thermal reactors. You can buy Thermal Reactor
            "test" pipes for about $200, I think, or replace your entire
            exhaust with new heat exchangers, etc.
         2. Put in an external oil cooler. A factory "hoop" cooler can
            be found for about $300 including all the lines and thermostat
            and provide very adequate cooling.
         3. Put in the "Carrera" chain tensioners. Your 3.0 is still apt to
            blow up (not having these). 
       If you already have a sick 2.7, then consider a 3.x conversion.
     If you are considering any Sick Porsche, think REALLY hard... But
     there is nothing about a magnesium case in-and-of-itself that is evil
     and your $5k Porsche may be the great running, great driving car for
     your budget.

        Lee A, (ex) '75 w/all the above plus

for my two cents, i too love the pre '73 911s. ive had my '71 T for 7
years now and the *driving experience* cannot be matched. when i recently
test drove an '87, i was left feeling like 'whats the point?' the car felt
heavier, more ponderous, etc. the early cars' light weight and driving
feel are unique.

i know there are arguments about increased power and handling of the newer
cars but unless you live near a track and drive your car there regularly,
what use is this? face it, todays traffic environment just does not allow
spirited driving. ive owned a '88 BMW M3 for 3 years now and it is a
fairly quick, extremely well handling car( i drove it at Bondurants 3-day
H.P. course). can i really use it during my daily
commute or weekend driving? no way. first of all, out here in the west,
the roads are basically straight, and the consequences of trouble over 80
mph are just too great. for going out and having a blast without getting
stupid, my '71 is great. all this talk about huge hp numbers and
incredible handling is interesting, but, CAN YOU USE IT?!

as for the dreaded trailing throttle oversteer of the older cars, how many
of you have ever spun you car while driving on the *road*? probably very
few. if so, i imagine the *problem* was driver related, not the fault of
the car. i mean, its not like these cars just snap.

Subject:      $$931$$ Pop-off valve

Hi folks. My 1981 924 Turbo has rekindled its appetite for money. Apparently
the pop off valve at the turbo, has developed a leak. The Haynes Manual, starts
off by suggesting that one first _remove_ the turbo, before conducting open
pop off valve surgery. Removing the thing is about the nastiest job one
can find on one of these little piggies. A casual inspection suggests that
I _should_ be able to remove the valve cover without taking the turbo off at
all.
(i) Has anybody tried this before?
(ii)Any clearance problems in removing the valve without yanking the turbo?
(iii) I don't know how much spring tension to expect when I remove the
cover. Should I expect parts to sail far and wide when I take it off? Surely,

You do have a slight weight advantage.  I'm not sure how much; I have
seen weight figures for the early cars between around 2250lb and 2450lb
(wet? dry? without wheels? I dunno) and more consistent numbers for the
SC/3.2 around 2700lb to 2750lb.  Also be sure to compare apples to 
apples, putting in a 3.0 will add more weight.

But 195's???  Ouch!  You have a serious lack of rubber under the 
rear end!

Yes 195/50/16 tires will lower the car some but why do you want to 
degrade you handling in that fashion?  The overall ride height is 
important.  However when you downsize the tires, you do not change the 
CG to suspension center height, which I think is even more important.

Having the car lowered via chassis adjustments will change both 
overall CG and CG to suspension height.

The 911 chasis may be set to pretty much any ride height.  The main 
limiting factor is whether the tires will fit under the fenders.

Here the SC/3.2 has a clear advantage.  I run a 225/50/15 on an 8" 
wheel in back.  This tire has a theoretical OD of 23.8".  A 195/50/16
has a theoretical OD of 23.7".  At the same chasis height, you will 
have an height advantage of a tenth of an inch.  I will have more than 
1" more rubber on the ground.  Which do you think is going to 
handle better?  Hint: the "coefficent" of friction you learned about
in freshman physics is not that good an approximation for elastic 
materials.

I could fit a 245/50 or 245/45 on either an 8" or 9" wheel [9" not 
legal for class for me :-( ], adjust the suspension to have the same 
CG height as anything an earlier car will support and have 2" more 
rubber than you have with a 195/50.  

I believe the later cars also have a wider track in the back.  Also 
improves the handling.

The bottom line is that for a given CG height, you can get more rubber 
on the ground with SC/3.2 fenders than you can with pre-SC fenders.  

More rubber = more handling.

More weight = less handling.

Are you sure you know where the cross-over is?  I'm sure I don't know.

Aerodynamics.  Yes, the early car has less drag.  Helpful at Bonneville,
but not too many other places.  Were not talking about a fart in a 
hurricane, but were getting close.  

Here's some food for thought.  I know someone with two 911's.  One 
is an early 911E (1969?) that has a 2.4 liter engine that probably
produces around 200 hp.  Structural roll cage.  The car is 
still street legal but is primarilly a track car.  Knowing the 
driver, I suspect that this car has been worked pretty near the edge 
of the rules.  The other is a 3.2 cabriolet that is completely stock 
(7&8x15 wheels, limited slip - both options for that model).  He 
tells me that his times are only about a second or two faster in the 
track car at Sears and Laguna.  

Oh yeah, the driver is a TTOD (street tires) contender in many auto-x's.

#> I'd like to know because my '76 has to work its butt off to keep up with those

Oh, that's easy; they're working their butts of to stay ahead!   ;-)

#300 or so lbs.  Racers pay mega bucks for plastic, carbon-fiber, and 
#weight loss programs to gain this advantage.

True, but most of us are not racers.  I've had some of my best 
runs with a 220 lb instructor in the car (of course, that was before
the corner ballance - maybe he just leveled it out a bit...).

As Dave Darling has mentioned: spend some time, money, and effort
learning to drive well, then worry about getting that last little
bit of Hp and weight.

If I could drop 300lb, I'd do it.  I don't know that I'd want to 
give up a whole lot of rear rubber to do so.  Getting on the power
early in the turn is *critical*.

The bottom line is that I get beat by some early cars and I beat
some early cars.  As near as I can tell, it's the driver I have
to worry about.

Subject: Racing Slicks on 911?

A friend asked me to ask this august body about using slicks on a 911 
for track use. His 911 is a 72E with a 3.6 DME motor with lightened 
clutch, chip, and free flow exhaust. He has a limited slip 915 trans, a 
ducktail, RS spoiler, and 225 50 15s in the rear (on Minilites) and 205 
55 15s on the front, currently shod with Yokohama A008rs's. He has big 
bars (23 and 31 I think) and adjustable sway bars, shock tower brace 
and hiem joint shock bushings. I don't know if any of this matters, but 
just in case...

Obvously, he has more motor than tires and since he wants to postpone 
flares and big tail for next year, he was thinking about using slicks. 
Conventional wisdom says that your suspension needs to be set up much 
differently for slicks, but does this mean? are their other issues? Is 
this a good idea? What kind of difference would it make? Where can you 
get slicks for 911s?

Any info appreciated - thanks

Subject: Early S vs. Late SC

Mike

Being the happy new owner of a '73 911S, I couldn't agree with you more.
The early S's may require a bit more maintenance, but I KNOW the resale
value for especially the '72 and '73 S will offset the extra maintenance.

Additionally, I like the sound of my S vs. an SC motor.  Mine's much louder.
Especially when taking it above and beyond 4k rpm's.  Wow, what a great
sound.

Since it was a racing car, did he use the el cheapo Carbon ($40), the

Hmmm, sorry to hear you've had such bad luck with your Koni's, Mike.  Mine
have lasted me over 5 years.  A little street use, but A LOT of A/X and some
track use -- no problems (yet).  You may have heard of Dwight Mitchell?
 He's run on Koni's since I've known him -- arguably the best 911
autocrosser/Pro Solo driver in the states (most national wins in a 911).

By the way, I like Bilsteins too, maybe even a touch better -- just think
they aren't *THAT* much better...

>The Koni adjustment is only for rebound (pulling out) and will not
>help if your shocks are really worn out.

My Koni adjustables do both.  When I change the setting, both compression
and rebound are affected.  I compared Koni (non-sport) adjustables versus
Bilstein sports and found that on the stiffest setting, the Koni's were
stiffer than the Bilsteins (which don't adjust) -- I can only imagine how
stiff the Koni Sports are.

On Ted's ultimately fast car:  Let me get this right.  You have a mid 70's
911 with a 150K mile 3.0l ('78?) in it and skinny/low profile tires and you
are talking about racing SCs and Carreras?? -- what only up to a 100mph in a
straight line?

Get a musclecar Ted and save us all some eyesight (reading your stupid
notes) and fingertips (writing replies).  Or you might try what a previous
poster suggested and try out a PCA driving event (AX or Timetrial).  Or are
you too "chicken" to find out how outclassed you and your car might be?  You
live in PCA Zone 7 territory -- plenty of "slow" SCs and Carrera's to "race"
with at one of those events.

See you at the track.....

As one of the 'locals' of the Houston autocrossing scene, and in fact a 
proud 914 owner and racer (thanks to Stan selling me his car) I can tell you 
there is __lots__ going on around here.  Both the SCCA and PCA have at least 
one AX each month.  So generally a minimum of two events.  

Most are held at the Houston Police Academy (HPA) right by Inter-Continetal 
Airport on the 1st and 3rd Sundays.  It is a great facility.  Basically a 
miniature road course/combination oval.  We also hold events near-by in a 
couple different parking lots and once a year (July 3rd) at Texas A&M.  This 
is now known as the infamous Firecracker event.

The Lone Star PCA also puts on high speed "driving events" at Texas World 
Speedway every couple of months.  This is basically road racing without the 
checkered flag or a Solo I without the clock.  Race-your-heart-out sort of 
deal on a fast road course for $90!!!!!!! 

As Stan had mentioned,  there is a very active PCA group in Corpus.  And 
there are lots of 914 drivers.  (I know, cause I just got beat by them all 
at the Divisional!!)  Don't know their schedule though.

Here is the upcoming schedule as I know it to be:

July 3rd        SCCA    Texas A&M       College Station
July 17th       PCA     Houston         HPA
Aug 13&14th     SCCA    Texas A&M       College Station (SCCA Divisional)
Aug 20th        PCA     Houston         HPA  (Night time AX!!!)
Sept 3&4        PCA     Houston         HPA  3 day event (AX,RALLY, other)
Sept 11         PCA     College Station Texas World Speedway

Porschephiles:
My 914 is worn out, and if I found the right car for under $10,000, I would
replace it.
I would like a 914 for street use which is structurally and mechanically in
excellent condition, with absolutely minimal rust (who wouldn't?).
If anyone hears of such a car, please tell me (I know about Alex's car).

just as soon as I can.

	Well, life went on, and I kept trying to buy my

and if I didn't have other priorities, yep, no money.

Stock 217 SAE HP is about 1.7 bar boost.  247 HP cars show about 1.8 
bar.  This is a steady-state figure, not the peak one you'll get at low revs.

If your car shows 1.4 max boost at anything about 2500 rpm (given

I was never very good at it.

The problem is that I run out of visability (and thus safety) long

I encourage you to attend the auto-x school in August; I've never

John,

Many of us on the mailing list DO take their Porsches to autocrosses
and track events. I am talking about our daily drivers too. So, I do
understand your viewpoint, but it does not apply to me.

The car I drive is handles better and, with the right shoe, is
significantly faster (lap time wise) than a '73 S. It also weighs
400 pounds more and has morer horsepower. I am in the process of
learning how to drive this car properly by autocrossing it whenever
possible.

The "lift" (not trailing) throttle oversteer problem is only a problem
when the car is driven close to the limits of adhesion of the rear
tires. Lifting the throttle changes the weight ditribution abrubtly
and causes the rear tires to unload and break loose. Not everyone
does this on the street (I bet Ted does ;-)...). When setting up a
latter 911 for racing, the cars ends up much closer to the lift
throttle problem than it did stock. Porsche builds all kinds of
understeer into the cars to combat this problem. The 993 is a
relatively nuetral car thanks to its multilink rear suspension.

Subject: Kneeguard Removal on '73 911

Thought I'd share some info on removing the kneeguards on an early 911.
I wanted to remove the right one in my '73 because the vinyl was separating
from the metal directly under the glovebox door.  Years of opening
and closing the door took its toll on the adhesive I guess.  

I thought I had to remove the glovebox door to repair the kneeguard, but
the kneeguard actually can be removed from the dash separately.  All you
need is an 8mm socket.  Two nuts to remove, one on the left under the 
stereo and one on the right at the end of the dash, where the kneeguard
bends around the dash.  The kneeguard can then be pulled away from the 
bottom of the dash.  BTW, it you want to remove the glovebox door you'll
also need an 8mm socket and an offset philips screwdriver.

Well, it's like this: most slicks are bias ply, and need a *LOT* less
negative camber to work right. So if you're used to setting up 
cars for radials, which most of us are, you'll automaticly seek
solutions that just don't apply. You've got to set up the suspension
using either a pyrometer or better, a v-groover (this gizmo chucks
into a drill and cuts a very narrow very shallow v-groove across the
width of the tire. then you run the car some, and bring it in. you
seek to balance wear across the width of the tire, and you're done.
*MUCH* more effective than a pyrometer. learned this on the roundie-
round tracks...)

There *ARE* great radial slicks out there -- the Goodyear Racing Eagle
radial series, the Pirelli P-Zero Slicks (available from Eurotire in
NJ, *ONLY* BTW...), to name a few. But you'll still have to set up the
suspension for them... For "regular" bias-ply slicks, there are
Hoosiers (great tires, good price) and Goodyear and Flintstone -- umm,
*Fire*stone... (not a fave, as you can tell).

Ask your local SCCA or PCA club racer guys, or an IMSA team if any happen
to be handy. The roundie-round guys know this stuff too, but speak a whole
'nother language when they're trying to talk about handling, tires, etc.

To all of you out there, especially those talking about racing 911s recently:

DON'T GO RACING ON THE STREET!

It's dangerous, to you and others, and if you are too lazy or too stupid
to race on a race _track_, maybe you should sell your Porsche and buy
yourself a motorcycle. At least that way, when you crash, chances are
you'll only kill yourself.

I'd think people would get over this once they graduated from high school.

John,
I have a 73' 914. I am using the WR7DP's with no problems.
I believe the 'D' has nothing to do with heat range, just length.
The number indicates the heat range.

I have Weber's on mine so I can't comment on the amount of buildup that is
normal on the D-jet cars.
I am using the MSD6-AL box too.
Where did you mount yours? I put mine in the rear trunk but I don't think it

Not counting the weight of the 3.0 over the 2.7, I think it's close to 
300 lbs.

I don't think so.  I've tested how sticky they can be at far higher 
speeds than you would go at an auto-x.  It depends on the weight of the 
car, driving conditions, and other handling characteristics.

To be honest, I think the 195/50*16.  You have a stiffer wheel than 15", 
less sidewall flex, less unsprung weight from the heavier wider rim and 
tire, etc.  Why do you think the factory Supercars have 18" wheels?

Many Cadillac's probably have more rubber on the ground than a lot of 
p-cars, but I think we both agree the p-cars handle better.

18 years ago, I had my first crash on Page Mill, a few miles from 
Skyline, between foothills park in PA and what's now Los Trancos Preserve.

Was in my first car, a then new '76 yellow Fiat 128.  Whole night walking 
down to foothill college to call my sister, I was thinking how I could 
have avoided that crash into the mountain.

Since then, over the next few years, we used to race from Sky Londa to 1 
over 84, and head to head down moody road and page mill.

I don't do that much, especially since I've owned Hondas and BMW's over 
the past 15 years, but it get's tempting.  I could't resist racing my 
co-worker to Togos the other day.  He has a Mitsubishi Turbo.

Subject: Carrera RS '73 Safari & 356 resto. update 

Helloo....

First I have a question about an unusual car...........

I was bladdering in a book yesterday, and found a picture of the Carrera RS 
Safari. This car was raced in the Paris-Dakar and I wondered if someone had 
some information on this setup? The usual 2.8? Monster suspension? 
Production figures? It's really a 'strange' looker!

Then there is some 356 related stuff.....

I got my final batch of restoration panels a couple of days ago. This 
included right side fender repair pieces, tank floor, a fenderbrace and also 
a bundle of parts for my'60 T-5.

As always, quality of the parts is perfect. I've started cleaning out the 
tank floor area and cut out the old one. At first it seemed like a real 
terrible job, but as I checked over and found the edges of the old floor it 
was not too difficult after all. I have just spot welded the new one in the 
front and if I'm not called for by the Institute's soccer team I guess I'm 
going to finish the welding tonight. 

To be honest I start to understand how a 356 can add up to $50k for a 
top-notch restoration. My abilities are perhaps not good enough to do such a 
job, but I regret i didn't write a time list for the chassi work I've been 
doing on this car. It would soon add up to quite a few. If one should cover 
a $30/hour which should be normal(cheap?) rest-shop price, and I assume I've 
put about 15 hours a week in the project for about 24 weeks, we'd come out 
with 360 hours, plus another 40 for finishing, say 400 hours * $30 = $ 12000 
in work alone. *JUST* for the chassi rebuilld. Add $3-4000 in panels and 
we're up to $15-16000.

One should always be careful with this kind of calculation though.

With the summer shining and no 356 ready to launch yet, I'd almost wish I 
had that '65 911 right now.....! All this talk about understeer, tail-heavy, 
street/ track-racing, my car is faster than your car and related stuff, 
still get my adrenalin pumping. 

But with nothing more than my 21 speed Mountain Bike for the moment I guess 
I'll have to compensate with a trip to Rudskogen and whatch the Formel 
Vee's, Ford's and other classes battle for the Norwegian championships this 
weekend. (Or was it the road racing(250cc 500cc) championships......?)  
That's what I get for letting someone borrow my dd Ford, the '65 Chevelle SS 
still sits on building blocks behind the barn, and the closest I am to an HD 
right now is a pack of 3.5"  Memorex discs....    ?:^)

Whenever I see someone say they get 2 bar boost I start getting paranoid I'm not getting
all the boost I should.  I have had some severe anxiety attacks reading this list in the
past.  Mine goes to about 1.3 bar if I am pushing it, then if I push it all the way to
the floor I get maybe 1.6 depending on how hot the engine is.  What I am wondering is if
I have a loose throttle cable.  I really have to push the gas pedal down pretty far.  I
looks like an easy adjustment and I might like to try a sport cam, for awhile maybe.

I'm considering rebuilding (or at least top overhauling) the engine

I will have an experienced shop do the tricky parts or the parts

What books are available regarding the rebuild of these engines ?

Subject: Rev limiter flaky? Activates too early

Hi

I have a few questions about the rev limiter on my '83 911SC.
What does it do? Cut the spark? How is it activated?
I ask because I'm having 2 problems:

1. I always encounter the rev limiter right when I push in the clutch to
   shift to the next higher gear. The engine always seems to DIE. This
   is very disconcerting at 65mph. I have to use the starter to restart it --
   not very safe, considering the steering wheel lock, etc.
   Shouldn't the engine run normally as soon as its speed drops below the
   limit? The clutch is disengaged at this point, so there's nothing forcing
   the engine to turn, but I would think it would start to get spark (or
   whatever) again as soon as it slows below 6000rpm (or whatever the limit is),
   and resume normal running.

2. Sometimes when I accelerate hard through the gears several times the
   rev limiter seems to kill the engine at a much LOWER speed -- maybe 5000rpm.
   At least I think it's the rev limiter; the sensation is the same.
   This seems to happen when I've recently (in the last few minutes) hit
   the rev limiter (at the normal 6000+rpm).

Is my rev limiter flaky?
Any explanations of the rev limiter mechanism would be very much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

While waiting for my VW Corrado VR6 to be serviced at Mattie Imports

been brought in for service.

I noticed that the funny composite headlights didn't have any knobbies
sticking out the front to hang a headlight-aimer on.  I thought that
those funny glass bumps were some sort of DOT requirement?  I've seen
them on every US-spec car I've ever looked at except this 993.

How does the 993 get away without having them?  Have the rules
changed?  Or perhaps this owner put euro-lights on.

I would like to seek the wisdom of the net on using locktite on Rod

come off the bolt and as you can imagine the results were 
Catastophic. It ruined the case, crank, rod, piston and cylinder.
As I am about to start assembling the new motor and I am tired

avoid this problem again. Should I use locktite this time? 
Should it be red or blue? Other sugestions?

By the way the motor is a 67 2.0 S and used for track events.
Also before someone askes the Rod Bolts/nuts were new on the

Subject: 911 Woes !

Groan !  The 911 vs. Bank Account saga continues.  First a minor problem
(is there such a thing on a Porsche ?).  I have an 82 911 SC.  When the
rubber fuel line mates with the brass (?) fuel line towards the rear
of the car and then goes over the top of the tranny up to the back of
the engine I've got a major fuel leak (it's dropped my mileage from
17 m.p.g. to about 1/2 of that).  This leak appears to be in the bend of
the tube right above the tranny case where I can't see or touch it.  Is
there an easy way to get this fuel line out and replace it without
dropping the engine ?  If not, I was thinking of cutting the metal
line in front of and behind the leak, bending up a new piece and
threading it in place and mating it to the original with a bit of
rubber hose and two clamps at each join.  Comments ?

The other problem (more major).  When pulling away from rest in a turn
I get a vibration and "graunchy" feeling in by feet and bottom (can't
hear anything), it doesn't happen pulling away straight but it happens
either pulling away left or right.  I also have a loud "clacking"
noise (which I though might have been piston slap) pulling away from
rest.  It happens mostly with higher acceleration at lower rpms.  It
comes from the left hand side (where I discovered a busted cylinder
exhaust side stud the other day).  It doesn't happen when the car is
not moving (even when I gun the engine).  The frequency of clack
doesn't seem to increase with vehicle speed, in fact it goes away at
higher speeds.  Does this sound like a drive shaft about to go, or
 is the cylinder about to blow off ?

purchasing a radiator cap.  (READ: they should just give you one if you

Hi Ya'll

I just wanted to start a dialog about appropriate subjects to bring up in our
forum.

It seems that people are getting worried that they can't post non-technical
but P-car related mail. Personally, I enjoy reading about enthusiast's 
experiences and find that the *Driving* is just as important (although 
considered a leisure/luxury) as wrenching. 

I love this net for the great tips and advice that come from revered sources. I
also like to post little workarounds and the like I might 'discover' when
underneath The Orange Monster. However, I also enjoy posting muses and
observations made while in the cockpit (refer to: Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance).

I try, diligently, to keep the subject line directly related to the subject 
matter. I would like to recommend using model numbers in *ALL* technical
postings. With the current volume on this net, it makes it LOADS easier to
find tips that pertain. 

I hope that I'm not blowing hot air around, as we all are enjoying this
lull in the flamewars, but as I have an oldish printout of the monthly rules I
couldn't remember if there are strict guidelines for this venue (senility has
overcome).

Let's not forget that this net was created from a common bond of love and

I always use red. And always use new rod bolts and nuts, too. Just in
case. And I never use rods which have had the big end re-sized except
for engines for little old ladies... And always balance them. And...

Whoa, wait a minute.  Have you actually sampled some of the newer model
911s?  These things will fly.  The first 911 I ever drove was an '84 with 20k
miles on it.  Driving that thing was a religious experience.  The only other
911 *I've* driven (no flames please, I'm drawing on my own personal exper-
iences) with as much seat of the pants grunt was a '77 930 (above 3500rpm).

I think this "my car is better than your car" thing is getting pointless.  
Yes, each particular 911 model has its strengths and weaknesses, but that
is all part of the fun.  Everyone has there opinions as to the how important
each particular strength or weakness is.  Blasting someone for enjoying
their particular car will not will not help you win friends and influence
people.  In the hands of a competent driver, every 911 is a formidable
weapon.

Let's talk about something else.

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What can you tell me about the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          President, NetSmiths, Ltd.
          2025 Lincoln Highway
          Edison, NJ 08817

     He lives in Houston TX and works in Edison NJ (Don't bitch about 
*YOUR* commute): 
          Houston: e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
                   voice:  (713) 661-2084 
                   FAX:    (713) 661-0633
          Edison:  e-mail: stan@netsmiths.com 
                   voice:  (908) 287-8070 
                   FAX:    (908) 287-3883

     His cars currently include:  
          '81 Euro 911SC Targa (daily driver when he's where it is)
          '74 914 2.0 (SCCA ITA/PCA Club Racing)
          '64 356 SC (OK, so he fell in love again).

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How is the list maintained?
     
     The list is maintained fairly regularly.  Stan tries to handle
changes at least once every other day.  There will probably be times
when he's on the road and less able to deal with problems, so be
patient.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  You can also 
reach Stan by phone at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070 when he's not
traveling.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What about Unix-based mail problems with the list?

     If you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay attention to 
your replies.  The default will send the reply to the "porschephiles-
request" address, as it is the UUCP "From" address (first actual line 
of the mail header).  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT STAN ROUTINELY TRASHES SUCH 
MIS-ROUTED MAIL!  If your mailer starts screwing up, you will be dropped
from the list.  Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any 
more, send Stan mail and he will do his best to figure out what's
happening.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the copyrights or ownership of material sent to the list?

     The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence
by and between members of a closed community.  As such, the copyright
for EVERYTHING that ANYONE posts lies with them.  PERIOD.  This is 
*NOT* a bulletin board system, where consent for further redistribution
is implied by nature of the the system; it's PRIVATE.  If you wish to
use something written by someone on the list, you must first seek their
permission unless they specifically grant the right in that specific
posting to reprint it at will.  And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD idea
to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing
up down the line.  Remember, when you read something on this list: what
you are reading belongs to whoever wrote it.  They may have plans to
publish it further themselves.  They may want to keep it "private"
(i.e. just for list member use).  They may not care what gets done with
it.  It's still theirs, and before re-use, permission must be
obtained.  Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a
big deal about it.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available via FTP at tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/
Archives in five subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94) each of which has 
the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  Period!!!  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM
CST, or Stan may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to
mail you archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to
use BINARY mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX
"uncompress" program, or equivalent, to restore to textual format.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What else is available in the tta.com archives in /pub/porschephiles?

     FAQs: This FAQ; also specific FAQs about specific Porsche models
are being added (so far there's only one, for the 914--feel free to
contribute one on YOUR favorite Porsche).
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
            1970.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914, 1976.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
            of the four-cylinder engine.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 as the 924S with the 944 drivetrain.
            Has the best aerodynamic shape of any Porsche.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the

            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, due in showrooms in 4/94.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the meanings of terms and acronyms I've seen in the list?

     FAQ  - Frequently asked questions (but you knew that)
     FWIW - For what it's worth
     IMHO - In my humble opinion
     IMO  - In my opinion
     PCA  - Porsche Club of America, the major US/Canada Porsche
            enthusiasts organization
     POC  - Porsche Owner's Club, the *other* US Porsche owner's group;
            in the past they have been more competition-oriented than 
            PCA, which has many interest groups participating
     PCGB - Porsche Club of Great Britain
     PCNA - Porsche Cars of North America (Reno, NV), the US importer
     PANO - Not an acronym; this stands for Porsche Panorama, the PCA 
            national monthly magazine
     PAG  - Porsche AG, the mother company back in Stuttgart; "AG"
            stands for "Aktiengesselschaft," which means that the 
            company has publicly traded stock
     YMMV - Your mileage may vary
     :-)  - Smiley face (turn your head 90 degrees to the left to "read"
            it); various iterations exist using different ASCII 
            characters

What are some of the major Porsche aftermarket suppliers?

     Be aware when buying a part in the aftermarket that it may or may
not be the same part you would get from Porsche.  This holds true even
when the part carries the "correct" Porsche part number, and when it
carries Porsche's parts trademark.  The following suppliers, listed

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.

Every so often I see a question like this, or like "how much oil

People, I have *TWO* words for you: Owner's Manual.

This magic little book has all sorts of stuff in it, from how
to actually operate some of the more arcane devices in the car 
down to the maintenence schedules, oils to use, etc. I'm sure
your car has one, just look in the glove box. If you don't
then I'm equally sure that you can get one trivially.

Please check and make sure you have one. If you don't, get one.
If you've never looked at it, make it a long weekend project.

Subject: 911 driver's side door handle

Here is yet more evidence of the continually improving 911.

For those that have early 70's 911's, the driver's side door handle 
can be broken in this way.

1. Open the driver's side door

2. Push the door lock button down

3. Improperly confirm that you want to lock the driver's side door without
   a key by squeezing the door handle tab as you would to open the door. 

   Depressing the tab extends a "latch unlock" pin from the door handle.

   CAUTION... This doesn't work and can break the door handle.

   This confirmation method was used for driver's side door locking 
   without a key on some US cars I've owned/driven.

   So for some people it is a learned operation when locking the driver's 
   side door without a key.

4. If the 72T driver's side door is locked, as the door is closed, the latch 
   will try to push the door lock button out to the unlocked position.

   Unfortunately, with the "latch unlock" pin extended from the door handle,
   the operation of pushing the door lock button out strikes the extended 
   door handle pin with enough force to break the pin's support guide.

   This support guide is not available separately, so it is time for 
   heliarc welding or a new door handle.

   It explains why there are door handles at swap meets that are complete
   except for the pin guide assembly.

   This happened on a 70T I owned.  My 72T came with the drivers
   side door handle pin guide held together with steel wire.  

Now the good news..

   A recent spare driver's door I bought had a latch with datecode 9-77.
   This latch will not allow the driver's side door lock button to be 
   depressed with the door open.  

   This solves the problem. 

   I don't know when they made the change, but the newer latch works in the
   older cars.  

   So Porsche is continually improving even the small stuff.

This isn't an entirely accurate depiction of what I said (or, at least, it's
not an accurate picture of what I feel =^>).  I'm intimidated by the $10K cost 
about every 100K miles *beyond* the cost of routine maintenance.  I had a '69S 
for several years and I don't mind the several hundred dollar tune-ups, the cost
of a new pair of batteries every year, or even (gulp) rebuilding the tranny
when the time comes.  It's that gut wrenching find-ten-grand-for-a-new-engine 
then expain-THIS-to-your-wife feeling that really gets my shorts in a bunch.

I'm not so worried about total cash outlay (though, that DOES affect me), it's
just coming-up with that $10K -- ouch.  I know, I *should* save the money over
a long period of time.  I should also cut down on my cholesterol and save the 
paid electric bill receipt for my records =^>.

Actually, this whole discussion has been really helpful (though not in 
the way I thought it would be).  When discussing the mid-year-with-3.2-engine 
option with friends, I'm finding that I'm not getting really excited.  
What *is* exercising my adrenal glands is the thought of driving another 
early 911 (especially one with more power than my '69).  I'm just gonna 
have to put-up with the overhaul when it happens.

Subject: Rev limiter

Question: I have a few questions about the rev limiter on my '83 911SC.
What does it do? Cut the spark? How is it activated?

Answer: It is my understanding that the rev limiter, located in the cap of
the ignition rotor, interrupts current to the fuel pump when the rpm, and
hence the rpm of the rotor,  exceeds some finite value.  Looking at the
rotor in my 1981 911 SC, I see a spring making electrical contact between
two points.  When rpm increases, centrifugal force on the spring causes
electrical contact to break. This break apparently interrupts current
(power) to the fuel pump with the obvious consequence of limiting
revolutions.  (That's what I figure - though I am not sure).  Let me know
what you find out.

I want to know too.  I have H1's on my 911, and the last place I took it to
couldn't inspect it because of this very problem.  Had to resort to taking
my car to a beat-up old Exxon with the old style headlight aimers to get

I've also driven a '77 930 extensively, almost bought one once.  Decided 
I couldn't afford the maintenace at the time.

I'm not saying my car is better than anyones.  I'd much rather have a 
nice SC or Carerra, but stock, I'd be gaining a lot of weight over a 
pre-sc body 911 with sc+ engine.  

If we really wanted to get technical on "value" here, any Japanese car 
for same amt. of money will blow away any German car, whether it's 15K 
Acura vs. 15K 924, or NSX vs 993.

I'm just saying my older 911 happens to have a few advantages over the 
later models, in that it's an older lighter body, with still a 3.0 liter 
sc engine, lower cog, stiffer tires, and narrower body.

how do I get to it?  And 2) when the transmission (automatic) is put into

but is different in reverse.  What is this chime for?  What is wrong

performance of the pre-73 911's.  When we had Raman Sarin's 1971T
in to Puget Sound Tire for supension and alignment work the car was
corner balanced and etc.  The car has a 915 transmition, a 3.2l,
recaro seats, and full carpet etc. The car weighed in at 2250 plus or
minus a 2 or 3 pounds.  With oil cooler and roll bar we expect the
finished car to weight around 2325 wet.

Timing a 914
Hey, there, fellow P-Philes!
    I finally located the "bolt" that allows you to adjust the
timing on my 914.  That brings us to the question:
    How do you time your 914?  The Book sayeth to line up the dot
on the fan with the notch on the housing at 3500 RPM.  I assume
that this is done to fully actuate the centrifugal advance--but
why?  Tony Heyer says that he just does it at idle--but I didn't
see the idle mark when I tried, and the dot is out of the notch
at 3500 RPM--it lines up at 2500.  Is my timing retarded, then?
    I guess I'm just confused.

Subject: 911SC seat removal

Need net wisdom on removing subject seats. With seats all the way to the
rear, front bolts are readily accessible. With seats all the way forward,
rear bolts are still obscured. Do you have to stand on your head, hold
your mouth right, or what to remove rear mounting bolts? Is this all
there is (4 bolts/seat)?

Thanks in advance!

Well, from my perspective, as participants here, we should be part of 
a larger electronic community in which we're all doing something to
contributed to the ultimate driving enjoyment of the rest of the
participants. Now, for some of us, that means "how can I keep my
car on the road cheaply". For some, it has to do better in competitive
driving. For some, it's the concours thing. For some, it's just admiration
from afar, trying to vicariously satisfy a longing that oh, to which most 
of us can certainly relate.

So, just about anything should go here. Except being an asshole.

I've been there!  I had a 76 911S for 7 months until the repair cost forced
me to sell it, crushing a dream.  Then the second kid, a change in jobs and 
all looked hopeless.  But, 20 days ago, it happened and with a quality 
car.  Just got in from a 125 mile cruise with the wife and kids (yes, 
they fit in the back) . . . and the smile never goes away!

Good luck!  Be careful in your search.  And keep us posted!

Bruce:

You get this from Williams?  The 911 exploded version is exactly what I 
would love to have.  

How was the trip to Ohio for the races?
