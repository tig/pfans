	There was a question on the list recently about the relative
effectiveness of the Solo (cordless) and Escort (wired) radar detectors.
Sorry if I'm late replying, but I've been out of the office (and out of
touch with e-mail) a lot recently.

	According to the information I got from Cincinnatti Microwave, the
relative sensitivities (dB) of their detectors are :

			K band		X band		$ (US)
Passport		-105.0		-112.0		149.00
Passport Classic	-105.0		-112.0		169.00
Escort DSP		-114.0		-121.0		249.00
Solo			-105.0		-112.0		249.00*

* (someone said here that Damark are doing the Solo at $189)

	Having asked about radar detectors here recently, most of the
people who replied (for which, many thanks) recommended CM's products.

	However, none of the CM range deal with Ka band, which I believe
the English police use. I also want a cordless model, as I use hire cars
quite a lot (I'm not prepared to use the 944 for business use at 18.8
pence per mile!). The only 3-band, cordless detectors I have come across
are the Bel Express 3 ($212), Cobra RD-6000 ($180) and Whistler 2SE/3SE
cordless ($?).

	Has anyone had any experience with any of these (or know of any
other good 3-band, cordless detectors)? Information about these is pretty
hard to come by, as (possibly due to legal problems) the British motoring
press rarely reviews them, though after a recommendation from someone on
the list I tracked :-) down a copy of _Road & Track_ and will be
subscribing as soon as I can find time to get a US$ bank draft.

Subject: Noise?in 944

I've been owner of this 84 944 for only a couple of years and only take it out
in good weather for fun.  This is my first Porsche.  As I ride closer to the
transmission in this car than any other car I've ever owned I've questioned my
own ears and senses regarding a "noise".  I need help diagnosing the problem.

With the car cold, from a total stop, as I accelerate VERY gradually I'm
greated by a rythmic "chalk-chalk-chalk...."  It seems to mirror the speed of
the engine NOT the wheels.  That is, it starts slow and after I shift it seems
slow again.  This symptom seemed to disappear after a 5 minute gentle run.
But now it appears, not always, when the car and transmission are warm.  It
comes from the rear, it could be from one side but (I think I'm being
objective) it seems centrally originated.

On a trip this weekend, while cruising at speeds from 60 to 75, what I think
is the same sound (at a higher frequency - due to engine speed??) appeare and
it sounded like a vibration.   The earlier symptoms, with my best vocalization
of "chalk-chalk-chalk", were explained to the local Porsche repair people who
were unable to hear it.  I did not get to drive or ride with the actual person
who was unable to hear it so I can't confirm if the noise was there.

I am not very mechanically inclined and have some difficulty communicating
through the counterpeople who think chalk-chalk-chalk is not an adequate
description.  (Actually, it is a rather accurate imitation of the sound.)
Therefore I need some help.

Does this sound like anything anyone else has had happen with a 944?
Is my intuition of drive-train problems unwarrented? (I hope!!)
Any ideas??

Bruce -

I can't really tell from your description exactly whence the noise comes. 
However, based on experience I would suspect either a CV joint or a wheel
bearing.  You may be able to pin down which side's component is at fault by
loading up that side.  Driving down a straight piece of road at, say, 40 to 60
MPH, rock the car first to one side then the other by turning the wheel a tad. 
As you turn right, you load up the left side, and if that induces the noise,
chances are that it is that side which is at fault.  Not always, but amost
always.

Replacing a CV joint or rear wheel bearing is not a lot of labour, nor is it
terribly expensive.  I think it was George Beuselinck who wrote an article a
couple years ago in his PCA Region's newsletter suggesting that CV joints be
disassembled, cleaned, inspected, and repacked every 30K miles.  I agree.  Not
many people include this in their maintenance.

944 series transmissions are pretty much bullet-proof on the street.  Happy
hunting and let me know what you learn.

I can relate to you my experiences from my 911...

If you have a low rumbling sound when you put weight on one side of the
car or another, it is probably a wheel bearing.  For the rear wheel bearings,
you are right in saying it is not always the loaded side that is making the
noise.  I found this out the hard way - as of about a year ago I have two
new rear wheel bearings  ;-).  The rear bearings on middle ages 911s (I want
to say 70-73) are the same as on the rear of the 914, and have two internal
bearing races, an inner and an outer.  If the outer is worn, it will make noise
when that wheel is loaded.  If the inner is worn, it will make noise when
the other side is loaded.  The way to isolate the side is to pick one, take off
the tire, take off the brake caliper so there is no drag on wheel (or maybe you
have good calipers that don't drag), and spin the hub around with the
transmission in neutral and no parking break (some parking brakes drag a little
bit too).  My particular wheel bearing made a sound like a train going over a
track - clickety-clack, clickety-clack.

The first sign of CV joint wear it a clunking sound when you just start to
move from a stop.  Sometimes repacking the joint with new grease will fix it
(or at least fix the clunking noise).  I have a VW-guru friend who disassembles
and repacks his CV joints every 15K miles or so.  He claims a CV joint is bad
when any of the ball bearings have a bluish tinge to them - this means they
were overheated and probably warped.  I've seen clunking CV joints without
the bluish tinge, so I suspect they can just plain wear out.  Go figure...

Although there have been several replies to the original request which
focused on wheel bearings and CV joints, the description of the
problem makes me suspect the bearings in the torque tube (or whatever
Porsche calls it) which connects the engine to the transmission. Since
the transmission is in the rear, this would explain the dependence on
engine speed rather than car speed, and would explain why the noise 
seems to be coming from the middle of the car rather than one side
or the other. I seem to remember that some early 944s had a propensity
to wear out one or more of the bearings which support the drive shaft
inside the tube (there are several along the length of the tube), but
I don't remember any of the details.

Good news from a new mechanic (of all people..)  today.  The oil that looked
to be coming _from_ the turbo on the beast ('81 931) seems to have actually
been spilled _onto_ it by a leaky valve cover- &/or head-gasket.  No turbo
rebuild this month...

Anyway, this leads me to a question.  I'm going to be a weenie this time and
have this guy cleanup things and do the gaskets.  While it's apart, I want to
replace all the belts and hoses (pcv, fuel, cooling, etc), which are all in
rotten shape.  Do any of the Porsche parts houses package these things as a
'hose kit' or some such?  I really want to avoid calling a dealer and asking
for all the rubber he can think of ($$$).  Anything else that I should just
'naturally' replace while the head is off?  

Thanks for bearing with some simple(-minded) ?'s

Cheers

I've been given to understand that the more common ailment is scoring of the
races in which the balls run.  Their popping in and out of the scores/ruts is
apparently what makes the clicking noise.  Indeed, when we repacked mine a few
months back, there was a minor amount of scoring in one or two spots.

Subject: BlackHawk Farms 1992

Sorry for the multiples posts if you do receive more than
one.

I have no connection with Blackhawk Farms.

BHF is located I believe on the Ill. - Wis. Border.
I also believe that it has recently been repaved.

If you would like a GIF format file of the 1991 track
profile let me know (I've heard they added to the track).

Enjoy!!

Subject: CV Joints

Yes, Kevin, I did write an article some time ago about repacking my
CV joints.  It really is a Good Thing to do, especially when you see
what they cost.  We check CV joints for play at Track Event tech
inspections, and will reject a vehicle with too much play.

Most of the worn CV joints I have run across have been on front-wheel
drive vehicles (VW and Audi).  The wear is usually in the races for
the ball bearings.  The wear is either a groove worn into the race
(caused by a lack of lubrication or just old age) or pits into the race
(caused by an infiltration of dirt into the lubricant).  Those problems
usually cause a vibration under acceleration, or a knocking while
the steering is turned to a large angle.

I have never seen "Blue Balls" from heat.  :-)

When I repacked the CV joints from the 944 (at 60K miles), the grease
was ample and clean, and the joints showed very little wear, just a
touch of polishing on the race.

CV Joint grease is available in the 14 ounce tube from a couple of
mailorder places.  Make sure it is molybdenum disulphide.  Anything
else will just break down.

If you want a copy of my newsletter article, send me a note and I
will find it and send it to you...

All that having been said, the noise that started this thread sounded
more to me like clutch or torque tube or transmission input shaft noise
than CV joints.

This is also correct.

You're 3 for 3. What they did was add a "chicane" thats not really a
chicane, but more of a left handed sweeper followed by a hard right and
a hard left between what used to be called turns 3 and 4. I believe they
are going to renumber everything after 3... this mod was made because
formula cars were going into 4 too hot, hitting the FIA curbing on the
outside of the corner, and getting launched. In at least one case, the
car cleared the tires/armco. Not good when a spectator grandstand is
right there. So in theory this will slow the cars down. We'll see. If
anyone really wants to know how well its working, ask me after the
Chi/BVR SCCA drivers school at the end of the month....  my hunch is I
will be working the new turn at least 1 day....

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

Spring seems to be well and truely upon us, and autox season has taken
hold. Enjoy! This also starts the season of being able to actually 
enjoy washing your car without freezing to death, which means concours
events are just around the corner.

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, join!! 
I'm going to investigate getting permission to create an "electronic region"
where the "region boundaries" are defined by network connectivity. Won't
displace your regular physical region, but hey, you should see how we'd
get to do the driving events... 8{)

Along the same line, I now edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region. 
If you happen to have on-line copies of your regional newsletter, or
at least the interesting articles, maybe we can set up an article exchange.
Or, if you'd like to write something or have something written that you'd like
to see in print outside of your own region, let me know....

Porsche Club of Americia.
Does take non-US membership.
+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@karazm.math.uh.edu


The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) Please try to send all administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, as some members have discovered,
   you can also reach me by phone (sometimes).

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address. Such messages are discarded.

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Well due to the volume of mail I receive I've got to go to the digest (have
sent to the correct address). Just to say thanks even though I'm a non
Porsche driver (but if I sell the Merc it'll probably be a 928). Thanks
also from John Shales who used to work here, drives a 911 Carrera and is
a member of the Porsche club USA and up until recently ran the newsletter
here. Many of your comments and articles have gone to this newsletter, and
the digest will continue to, and used as help. So once again thanks.

Seb

p.s. Went to Stuttgart a little while ago but forgot to post a report about
     seeing the 968 production line. Sorry.

	Sorry to turn this into the radar-detectors-list, but this is my
last post on the topic (honestly!). I lost access to Usenet news a
while ago (when I changed jobs) or I would have done all this in one
of the general auto groups, but as this list contains the most
knowledgable car people I can contact, I'll work on the `flattery'
principal :-)

1. I've been comparing specs on a number of detectors. Some are more
sensitive than others and that I can understand. They all have
(much) the same centre point for X, K and Ka bands, but seem to have
very different bandwidths (e.g. from 100MHz to 240 MHz for Ka). Now
is a smaller bandwidth better (because it avoids interference from
outside that band) or is a wider bandwidth better (because it can
detect a bigger range of police detectors)?

2. Does anyone have *any* details on the Cobra RD-6000? Both Bel and
Cincinnati Microwave sent me brochures, but Cobra never replied
(despite promising to). I know that it's battery operated, but
that's about all.

Philip

P.S. If anyone can handle an Excel spreadsheet (PC) with lots of
data about various detectors, give me a shout and I'll be happy to
mail it to you.

Subject: Noise!in 944

The noise mentioned before IS there!  Thanks to George, Jeff, Kevin, Frank and
someone else whose message was deleted before printing; your inputs have been
helpful.  This is a progress and educational report and 2 questions.

Recall; 944 noise from rear end "chalk-chalk-chalk" which merged into a
vibration at speed.  Further playing with it suggests I was wrong; the
frequency of the noise IS with wheel speed (sounds like one "chalk" per
revolution); I suppose I was attributing the slight drop in speed/acceleration
to engine speed.

The noise is NOT influenced by loading one side or the other; tested by some
hard turning while accelerating.

Am I right thinking that if it is the torque tube that engaging the clutch in
neutral and giving a little throttle should produce the same noise??  I get no
noise under these circumstances. (QUESTION 1)

I guess this begins to narrow it down to the CV joint, probably left side
rear.  I had someone jogging along outside listening as I drove in first gear
with one foot on the brake and one on the gas; they thought left rear too.

Armed with all this, I took it to the dealer counter person who, after I
proudly presented all my evidence, wrote "chlunking in wheel" as the problem!!
(spelling is as they wrote it - could that be German? QUESTION 2)

Well, I couldn't find the article on CV joints, but I did find a couple
of articles that my region was willing (they are desperate for filler)
to publish. I'm putting them here for further dissemination.

If you are foolish enough, you may publish them again and again, just
spell my name and region correctly...

944 Fuel Tank Sender
by George Beuselinck, Hudson Valley Region

Over the last couple of months, I had noticed that my gas gauge had gone
haywire.  When the tank would get down to 3/4 full, it would jump and
gyrate from 1/4 to 1/2 to 3/4 and back to 1/4, all in two or three
seconds.  I had seen this problem before, and replacement of the fuel
tank sender had resolved this problem for two years or so, and now it
was back.  I ordered a new sender, replaced it, and that was that.

Except that, a week later, guess what:  the gas gauge goes haywire
again.  Now, I'm really burned! I just spent $$ on a sender that did not
solve the problem.  (I hate it when I waste money or time.) So, I now
figure that this problem is in the gauge itself, not in the sender.  I
start looking for gauges in the various catalogs. Suddenly it hits me:
perhaps the failure of the sender is a design flaw, and that I can check
it out and resolve the flaw...

Seeing as how I now have two senders, one brand new and the other two
years old, both of them suspect, I thought I would do a little test. I
dismantle the old one, removing the nut at the bottom of the sender.
That releases the cylinder in which the float resides.  The float rides
up and down a rod, and two sets of contacts on each side of the float
ride on a resistive wire which act as a rheostat, changing the
resistance depending on the height of the float (which is changed by the
height of the fuel inside the tank).  Sure enough, when I jiggle the
float, the gauge jumps like crazy.

Removing the sender is easily done.  It resides in the luggage
compartment under the carpet.  There is a small fabric cover, held in
place by a mild adhesive.  Under that is a plastic cover, just popped
out with your fingernail.  The sender itself is held in place by five
hex head bolts (the Porsche parts catalog calls them "cheese head
bolts") which clamp down on a rubber gasket.

When you remove the sender from the tank, you should have less than a
half tank of fuel.  Also, remove the sender slowly, or your luggage
compartment will reek of fuel for days.  Having the battery disconnected
when you do this is probably not a bad idea either.

Once you have the sender out of the tank, it is pretty easy to test it.
Just manipulate the sender float while watching the gauge.  The gauge
should move smoothly, not jerkily.  At the bottom of the float's travel,
the low fuel idiot light should come on.

Testing the sender out of the tank tells me the cause of my problem: the
two sets of contacts can lose the tension providing the change in
resistance.  A careful tweak with a small screwdriver on each side of
the float, the tension is increased, and the sender is fixed.

The repaired original sender is now back in the car.  Anyone care to buy
a fuel gauge sender for an early 944, used only one week?

944 Water Pump Replacement
by George Beuselinck, Hudson Valley Region


One of the characteristics of the 944 which differentiates it from the
911 and 356 families is a liquid cooling system.  That system includes
a water pump which fails often enough to be of concern, especially
when local service hourly rates approach $80 per hour and new pumps
are in the range of $400 to $600 each.

The individual steps in replacing the 944 water pump are not difficult
taken one at a time, but the prospect of doing them in the proper
sequence without causing additional damage or future problems can be
intimidating to the novice.

Removing the water pump is easy enough.  There are 11 bolts holding it
to the block.  Unfortunately, those 11 bolts are behind a panel, that
panel is behind the timing and balance shaft pulleys, those pulleys
have belts on them, the belts are behind another panel, and there are
12 bolts holding the panels in place.

Tools

Before you get started dismantling this puzzle, assemble your tools.
You will need serious sockets (half-inch drive plus breaker bars and
cheater), a torque wrench, a couple of special tools (among them the
cam belt tension gauge, the flywheel lock, and the balance shaft
sprocket tool for removing the bolts which attach the pulleys), a
large gear puller, and the usual floorjack and jackstands.

Removal of Other Stuff

Put the Number 1 Cylinder at Top Dead Center.  Disconnect the leads to
the battery.  Remove the starter.  Attach the flywheel lock to hold
the crankshaft steady while you continue.

Make sure that the engine is cool.  Remove the cap on the radiator
overflow tank.  Drain the engine coolant and dispose of it.

Remove the alternator and power steering drive belts.  Remove the
front belt covers.  Remove the distributor cap and rotor and the
aluminum cover.  Mark the timing and balance shaft belts and pulleys
with a bit of paint so that you may replace them (if you are not
putting new ones on) in the same place and going in the same
direction.  This is an important step for retiming the engine without
problems.  (If you do not have a factory manual, make a reference
diagram of the belts, pulleys and idlers.)

At the very front end of the crankshaft, there is a large bolt,
tightened to very high torque.  Remove this bolt.  Remove the balance
shaft belt.  Remove the timing belt.  Pull the gears on the
crankshaft, using a puller.

Remove the bolts holding the balance shaft pulleys in place.
Before removing the pulleys from the balance shafts, use some paint
to mark their timing positions on each of the the balance shafts.
(There are two keyways on each of the timing pulleys, allowing them to
be out of time when reinstalled.  This results in a buzz in the engine
at higher RPM, which will alarm you when you feel it.)  Also, mark the
distinction between the upper and lower pulleys.  Remove the pulleys
on the balance shafts, and the idler pulleys.  Remove the bolts
holding the rear belt cover and remove the cover.

You can finally see the water pump.  At this point, you should also
check for leaking oil seals which are also a common occurrence
on earlier years.  You may as well replace them while you're this deep
into it.

The Pump

Remove the hoses leading to the pump.  Remove the bolts and the pump.
Clean the block surface of any gasket material.  Install the
thermostat in the new pump.  (Don't forget to do this, it is much
more difficult with the pump installed.)  Apply gasket adhesive to the
water pump and gasket surfaces.  Install the water pump, being careful
to torque the bolts to the proper specs.  Install the hoses leading to
the pump.

Reinstall the Other Stuff

Reinstall the rear belt cover.  Reinstall the gears and pulleys.  Make
sure that the pulleys are properly timed to the balance shafts and
that the upper pulley is on the upper shaft, the lower pulley is on
the lower shaft.  Torque the crankshaft bolt to spec.  Reinstall the
timing belt and adjust to spec.  Remove the flywheel lock.  Reinstall
the starter.  Remove the spark plugs and turn the engine by hand to
ensure that the timing has not changed, and that there are no noises
like valves hitting pistons.  Adjust the timing belt tension using the
gauge.  (Nothing else works.)

Reinstall the balance shaft belt, making sure that the timing is
correct.  Adjust the balance shaft belt tension using the gauge.  If
the cam timing and the balance shaft timing is correct, at TDC all the
timing marks line up exactly.  If not, do it over until you get it
right.

Reinstall the aluminum cover, rotor and distributor cap.  Reinstall
the plastic front belt covers.  Reinstall the alternator and power
steering belts.  Add fresh coolant, taking care to prime and bleed the
system properly.  Reconnect the battery leads.  Start the engine and
check for leaks.

Total time: about four hours.
Total cost: the water pump can be found rebuilt for about $150.

How to be Cheap (and Still Keep Your Porsche Happy)
by George Beuselinck, Hudson Valley Region

Take it from me, there are always at least two ways to do anything on
your Porsche.  At a minimum, there is the expensive way and then,
there is the cheap way.

The expensive way is one known to all.  You take your car to someone
and say, "It's making a funny noise (pulling to the right, doesn't
have enough power, hard to start, leaking oil, etc.) Fix it."  The
really expensive way is to say, "Call me when it's done."

I wish that I had the nerve to do something like that.  I have a
friend in California who took his new Alfa into the dealer for a 3000
mile checkup and said "Take care of it."  I really admired him at that
moment.  What nerve!  What panache!  When he picked it up two hours
later, paying a bill for $800, I really wondered about his sanity.
No, I will not be lending him any money to get him out of bankruptcy.

I have often been accused of being cheap.  All my friends have said I
am cheap.  My brothers and sisters say I'm cheap.  My parents say I'm
cheap.  People that I don't even know say I'm cheap.

So what am I doing driving a Porsche?

Would you believe that I really, honestly, sincerely believe that you
can be cheap and still own a Porsche without there being a
philosophical inconsistency in doing so.

Here's what I think is cheap on a Porsche:

1) Gasoline for a Porsche costs just the same as it does for a Nissan
Stanza or a Yugo.  Sure we use a bit more, but isn't it worth it?

2) Insurance on our 944 is cheaper than that on either of our Audis.

3) Windshield wiper blades cost the same as on any other car.

4) Spark plugs are cheap, and there are only four on a 944.

5) The labor rate at my favorite service place (my own garage) is
exactly the same (free), and the guy who does the service (me) would
rather marvel at the beauty of a Porsche than some other car.

Of course, there are some things that it is stupid to be cheap about.
Cheap tires don't belong on any car, much less a Porsche.  Cheap brake
jobs will get you in trouble.  Being cheap on insurance coverage can
hurt you when you need it most.  Delaying an oil change is foolhardy
at best, tempting fate at worst.  Cheap tools will cost you more in
the long run than good tools.  If you own a 911, not installing an
airbox flapper valve or oil-fed chain tensioners is being cheap and
stupid.  If you own a 944, not having your timing belt properly
tensioned and changed every 30000 miles is cheap and stupid.

Perhaps the best thing about owning a Porsche is having the
opportunity to be a member of the PCA.  I just sent in my dues for
next year, thirty-six dollars.  I still believe that the benefits of
membership far outweigh the costs.  If it were not for the PCA, I
would be spending much, much more to keep my Porsche alive and well.
The technical support and advice available have saved me many hundreds
of dollars in the last three years.  (If you don't know how I came up
with that figure, give me a call and I can itemize it for you.)
I just saved enough on replacing my water pump to pay for the next
20 years of PCA dues.

Lastly, the multitude of sources for parts and services is
unparalleled by any other marque.  Try finding five different
mailorder outfits to get hard parts for a Toyota or Nissan and you'll
know what I mean.

Being cheap is not only the end result of a lifelong pursuit of
economy, it also can give you the satisfaction of driving a great car
while sitting on a fat wallet.

Do It Yourself - Winter Chores
by George Beuselinck, Hudson Valley Region

Blessed as we are with living in the great Northeast, this time of
year gives us the opportunity to make some choices about the next few
months.  The first choice is whether or not to stay north or to fly
south for 3 or 4 months until the weather warms up again.
Unfortunately, the demands of my career require that I winter here,
not in the Bahamas or St. Thomas.  Most of us share the same fate.
(If you are independently wealthy and would like to subsidize my
companionship in a warmer climate, my phone number is in the back of
this newsletter.)

So, now that we have decided to enjoy the winter here, our next choice
is whether or not to drive your Porsche in the snow (and salt and
gravel and general muck).  I drove the 944 in the snow once, with
summer tires, and was scared spitless.  Not only was I all over the
road, so was everybody else.  I won't do it again.

Since we now have our Porsche sitting in the garage, and lots of free
time (except for those few nuts who flog their bodies on the ski
slopes), winter is a great time to take care of those things we would
not normally do during the summer when Porsche-pushing time is at a
premium.  Doing these little things will make the first drive of
spring a simple matter of turning the key.

One of the first chores is to change your coolant and coolant hoses.
Usually neglected, a burst coolant hose will disable a car as
efficiently as a blown motor.  (Have you ever thought of how unlikely
it would be for you to find a lower radiator hose for a 944 Turbo at
your local auto parts store, on a Sunday afternoon?)  Use a 50/50
mixture of antifreeze and distilled water for maximum protection.
Antifreeze by itself does not have the heat carrying capacity that
cools the engine.  Distilled water does not have the minerals that
leave deposits and limit the efficiency of the cooling process.

Next, change your oil and filter.  The old oil in your crankcase is
filled with acids and grit, and letting it sit all winter is not going
to do your engine any good.  Even with the new motor oil tax from
Uncle Mario, frequent changes are cheap insurance.

Don't forget your fuel filters.  If you can't remember when you
changed them last, it's been too long.  Your air filter could also
stand to be looked at.  Once again, cheap insurance to preserve an
expensive motor.

Fill your tank with good gas.  A full gas tank is less likely to be
subject to water condensation and the resulting contamination and
corrosion of your fuel injection system.

Take the time to consider doing those things that you have been
putting off (because you didn't want to take the car off the road for
such a long time) like rebuilding your CV joints, or changing your
shocks and struts, or refinishing your wheels.

During the winter, start your Porsche once every couple of weeks.  If
the weather permits, back it out and let it get good and warm.  Run
the air conditioner for a few minutes to lubricate the seals in the
compressor.  Check your tire pressures.  Check the fluid levels.  Keep
your battery charged.

Polish the car and think of warmer days, the wind in your hair,
hitting the apex at the downhill turn at Lime Rock, your significant
other in the passenger seat:  the good times.

Then go back in the house and warm your freezing butt by the fire.

The Value of Good Cheap Education
by George Beuselinck, Hudson Valley Region

Have you stopped to consider the value of your membership in the
Porsche Club of America?  In addition to the Porsche Panorama, the
technical support network, the newsletter, the free pizza at the
monthly meetings, the discounts at local retailers, and the
camaraderie of other members with the same interests as yours, there's
my favorite, Driver's Education.

What is your access to PCA Driver's Education worth to you?  If you
don't take advantage of it, it's not worth a penny.  If you do take
advantage of it, well, here's what I feel it's worth.

First, lets talk about safety.  The Driver's Education program is not
only about being fast on the track, it's about being safe.  Novice
drivers receive an orientation to the course layout and to classroom
theories of cornering and braking.  Nobody ever took a course on how
to drive fast in a straight line.  Any 16 year old in a car with a big
V8 can drive fast in a straight line.  It's when the roads get
interesting that the training makes a difference.  An educated driver
may avoid an impact in an emergency by using the techniques of
threshold braking and throttle steering learned and practiced at PCA
Driver's Education.  Knowing the way in which your car responds at the
limits of adhesion can prepare you for that moment when you round a
blind corner and find an obstacle in your lane.

In addition to the safety provided by good education and practice, our
Driver's Education program offers the opportunity for experienced
technical inspectors to check the safety features of your car.
Although the purpose of this inspection is primarily to provide a safe
environment for your instructor and the other drivers at the event,
another pair of eyes familiar with your model of Porsche can see
potential areas of failure that you may not be aware of.  In addition
to the tech inspection, your instructor can observe whether your car
is as stable as other cars of your model year and is running properly.
Think of it as the road test that you are not allowed to do on the
streets of your neighborhood (unless, your neighborhood includes
Stuttgart and Munich).

The last benefit of our PCA Driver's Ed program is that the cost is
minimal.  I just received a brochure from a famous driver's school.
For a three day track course, using your own car, their cost is $1600.
If you want to use one of their vehicles, the rent is $100 per day.
Add the cost of airfare and hotels and we're talking really big bucks
here.  The main reason that the program is so expensive is that the
instructors get paid, the big-name race-car driver (whose name is on
the sign outside) gets paid, the advertisers get paid, and someone has
to pay for the office staff you call.

PCA Driver's Ed instructors are volunteers.  They don't get paid for
doing what they love to do.  At best, they get to run in the event for
free.  Of course, having an unpaid instructor does not mean that the
instruction is the least bit inferior.  In my last 6 events, I have
been instructed by veterans of SVRA racing, IMSA racing, SCCA racing
and Firehawk Endurance racing.  Each instructor has given me a
different, valid perspective on driving at speed.  Each instructor has
helped to make me a better driver.  Each instructor has helped me keep
over $400 of my wife's hard earned money in my pocket!

Non-PCA members would love to have as much opportunity for cheap track
time as we have.  Let's face it, Bondurant and Barber and Derek Bell
are making a lot of profit providing the kind of experience that their
customers want for $500 and more per day.  As a non-profit
organization, we do it as a service to our fellow members.

Probably, but not guaranteed. The load on the bearings supporting a long,
thin shaft could well be different when the shaft is loaded torsionally.
In any case, the torque tube bearings sound like they are out of the
running if the noise is wheel speed dependent rather than engine speed
dependent.

Is the noise different when the car is accelerating than when you release
the gas and coast? If not, I would look for something other than CV
joints. It is my experience that CV joints and other parts which transmit
the engine torque through a contact between two parts (gears are another
good example) almost always have different noises on compared to off
the gas. If your noise doesn't do that, look for bearings, etc. I agree
that your test seems to eliminate the wheel bearings, but there are
also bearings in the transaxle at the other end of the half shafts
which turn at engine speed. Are you sure it is not something simple
like the brake disk rubbing against something intermittently with
wheel rotation?

Subject: Weird radio problem
Message-Id: <920403210803_76701.103_EHB42-1@CompuServe.COM>

Folks-
 
OK, here's a weird one for you.  It's in a BMW 732i, but don't let that
fool you; this could happen to anyone.
 
I just put the OEM AM/FM/LW/SW/Cassette radio back in my car, having
had it out for a couple of years trying (unsuccessfully) to find
someone who could rebuild the cassette drive.
 
The radio "pops" when I put on the brakes.  Just one "pop" when I hit
the pedal; other than that it works fine. The loudness of the pop is
semi-independent of the radio volume setting (i.e. you can hear the pop
if the volume is all the way down) but varies in strength according to
how long it's been since the last time I used the brakes.  The longer
between brake applications the louder the pop.  If I hit the brakes twice 
within, say, 2 or 3 seconds, the second application produces no pop at all.
 
The pop is timed precisely with the illumination of the brake lights,
so I would guess the brake light switch is (somehow) the culprit, 
 
but ...
 
(1)  Why didn't it do this with the radio I just took out?
 
(2)  How come the pop is stronger if I wait longer between brake
     applications?
 
(3)  Why doesn't something else react to this?
 
and ...
 
(a)  How can I fix it?  
 
I assume a capacitor, of the proper value and in the proper place, will
fix it, but I don't know enough electronics to know what size to put
where.  
 
The car has no other significant defects, and no other wiring/electrical
problems/"fixes"/modifications.
 
Any suggestions?

The noise is not there when off the gas, only when power is being put through
the drive train.  If I really baby it (say only slowly up to 1200rpm then
shift) I may not get the noise at all.  Kind of boring to drive like that
though!!

Hello fellow Porschephiles!

I am entering an Autocross this coming weekend and wanted to do a little
work on the 928 before I go.

1.) Get the Goodyear GSCS's that I bought mounted.
    Has anyone ran these new babies yet?  If so what
    are your impressions (They seem a Helluva alot sticker
                          then the ZRSs' I have)
    
2.) Install the exhaust Y-pipe.
    (Any 928 owner installed one of these?  Are there any
     tricks?)

3.) Dial in a bit more negative chamber.
    (How much is TOO much?)

4.) The gear box is sometimes tough to downshift (The 928 is a 1980, it
	does not have the Borg-Warner Syncros like the 1985-later :-( ).
	
	I am considering using synthetics in my 5-speed Manual.  Just
    about everyone swears by using MOBIL-1 for gear boxes.  My question is
    should I use the ATF or the gear-lube?  BTW the gear-lube is ~$11.00/Qt.
    and the ATF is ~$6.00/Qt.
Thanks in advance

Subject:      Injector retainers

In checking with other 931 owners on the list, we have discovered that the
injectors are housed in a plastic seat/insert/retainer (dependent on which
parts guy you talk to) which becomes loose allowing air to leak around the
nozzle. The result is really lousy engine operation. On the 931, the insert
has a plastic part (which screws into the head), molded onto a brass part which
the nozzle threads into. I do not know if other models have an exactly
corresponding part, but apparently mechanics overlook replacing these things
more often than not. Check to see if the nozzle can be wiggled around in the
head. They cost $10 each to replace and on the 931 take about 20 minutes to
install. 3 of us with 931's on the list had this problem. It's worth checking.
Especially considering the big difference air leaks have on operation of the
fuel system. Maybe the fault is unique to the 931, but I was surprised that
mechanics don't replace these things during a major tune up.

Don, unless I misunderstand something, ATF is automatic transmission fluid.
Typically, ATF is something like 5 weight oil.  Gear lube is usually 90 wt 
oil.

I once saw a 924 transaxle that had WELDED ITSELF TOGETHER when ATF was used
instead of gear oil.

I'd spend the extra $5/qt.

By the way, $11/qt isn't bad.  The last gear oil I bought was some swepco
which was about $50/gal at automotion.  Didn't make a damn bit of difference
in how the car shifted either (1980 911sc).

Thanks again to all who helped.  The chalk-chalk-chalk noise in my '84 944
turned out to be a bad CV joint.  They were all checked; one replaced, the
others repacked.  All is well for now (except $370 out) but I wonder...the CV
boot wasn't bad but just the joint.  The car only has 48,000 on it should I
expect the others to go soon?  The service people said the "left inner CV"
joint was bad.  How many CV joints does this car have?  I guess the word
"inner" throws me a little.

Greets,
 
I am parting out a 1973 914 if anyone is interested in anything.  Please
not that I do not have an engine or transmission for this car. Most everything
is still there.  Also, I have a late style bumper with factory fogs.  By late 
style, I mean the kind that came on the 76 models. 
 
Please reply if interested.

The 944, as with most cars with independent rear suspension and all Porsches
after the 356, has 4 CV joints, one at each end of each of 2 axles.
Since each rear wheel moves on a (more or less) straight up and down path,
2 universal joints are required on each side. Note that the axle needs
to change somewhat in length as well, which is also provided for by the
CV joints. Actually, I believe that the ability to provide both angular
and axial movement in the same joint is one of the big advantages of the
CV joint over the more classical "cross" type universal joint (the
lack of cylic variations in angular velocity, from which the name
derives, is the other).

Well I got the y-pipe and the Goodyear GSCS tires on the 928 last night.
Does a 0-60mph in ~6.2 secs not too bad (And it sounds like an animal
@ 5800RPM :-) ), I just wish I would've timed it with the standard
Skatorbacks and Cat. on.  Haven't been able to judge the GSCS's in the
Sun yet but the sidewalls seem very stiff, and the adhesion (at least
in the dark) seems decent.

Anyway the real question of the month of April is:

It's April 9th and I still don't have my copy of "PANO"!!!!
Anyone get theirs yet???

I'm starting the process of rust repair on a '66 912.  I've noticed
in the various parts catalogs (Tweeks, Stoddard, Performance) that
they all sell floor pans (left/right, front/back).  What I would like
is just the pan metal that goes around the edge near the rockers - just the
last 8" or so.

Does anybody know of a company that stamps out partial pans like this?

Subject: Detroit Region Season Opener

Well this past Sunday April 12th was the Detroit Region SCCA SOLO
season opener.  Partially organized by Team.net member Tom Tkacik!
another Team.net attendee was Brian Kelley ESP, testing out his new
3.73 rear end in his Mustang.

It was held at Wayne County Community College's Western Campus.  The
lot is relatively small by Detroit area standards, and is very slick.
Some might go as far as to call it "Greasy".  The weather was Cold, I
mean COLD!!!!!.  It got up to 43 I think by 3:00 in the afternoon, but
when I was walking the course at ~10:00 am there were some scattered
snow flurries (bluuurrr).  Tom and his group were decently organized
and the first car off was  ~11:00 am.

The L98 is not back from the machine shop and I had to drive the
Porsche 928 :-( (Not really, it just doesn't have quite the Torque 
that vette has).

The 928 races in B-stock (although I did remove the CAT. but I use the
stock muffler, I could probably put on a less restrictive muffler and
put the CAT back on for the sake of being purely legal and retaining
the same amount of power), not a lot of competition today just a
Turbo-Charged MR2 (I know last year the guy ran a chip that messes
with the boost so that really throws him into A-prepared, but with my
CAT gone who am I to bitch?). I threw a shaved set of 16" Goodyear
GSCS's on the 928.  The tires stuck great, my adhesion was as good as
anyone out there IMHO (Now if they last close to as long as my ZRS's
I'll have found the deal of the century), I can't wait to get my set
of GSCS's on the Vette.

I had a real tough time getting a clean run, I even Off Coursed my
first run.  Anyway I had Jeff Wixom (Finished 18th at Nationals in an
86 Vette Auto SS class this past Sept. in Salina) driving with me the
first 3 runs.  He is as could an instructor as he is a driver (Yes, I
mean that in a good way :-) ).  The only thing he would say while we
were driving was "Faster", (after the run we would talk in more depth)
and every time he said it, he was right.  I just wasn't used to how
good the GSCS's stuck.  Once I found the "Limit" of the Tires it was
down to business.  It took me till my 4th run (With Brian Kelley
riding shoot-gun) to beat the guy in the MR2 by 6/10ths.  They actually
gave a trophy (sorta it was a Beer Mug :-) hic...)  for winning a
class with only (2) entrants :-).
	
One of the high-lites of the weekend was riding with 1990-1991 SCCA
C-prepared National Champ "Buddy Jasmen" in his 1979 Indy Pace Car
Mustang.  I rode with him on his 4th run of the event which happened
to be FTD (Brain Kelley rode with him on his previous (3) runs, I am
sure he'll tell us about it :-) ).  Buds' car is completely gutted
with the exception of an AutoPower Cage (2) race seats and the
instrument panel (Of course to bring it up to the 2750lb class weight
requirement he bolts in ~100lbs of lead where the back seats used to be)

As soon as I climbed and strapped myself in I was looking for a place
to hold on, "ah.. this hunk of roll cage looks good, think I'll grab a
chunk".  I can't quite describe how fast the car is, the asphalt
sealed lot is very slick (and the cold temps didn't help the Hoosier
slicks hook up either).  Bud keeps the car in a constant state of
oversteer, the ride pushed my adrenalin level to the max.  Halfway
through the run I found my right leg shaking like "a cute little guy
in prison for his first hour" :-) The comment that I think really
applies is "Hey Bud Jasmen running today, you could sell tickets to
this one!"

Phew, the season opener is over with and the 1992 has finally 
started! (Now if you could only specify point size in an E-mail message
I would say (5x point size on) "KICK-ASS!" (5x point size off).

Can't wait to get the motor back in the vette and start getting some
Detroit Council points running in ASP.

I'll keep in touch on how the GSCS's on the vette wear once I get it
out on the track.  BTW Kim Baker of Baker Racing fame has a set of 17s
(don't know if there 9.5's 275 or 11's 315 or both) which he said had
at least 3/32nds on them and he wanted to sell for $150.00 for the set
about (2) weeks ago.  If your in the market for some very stiff walled
soft compound meats I recommend that you take the gamble on the wear.
Hell at $150.00 for a set how can you go wrong?

Subject: AC system


I would like some tips for diagnosis and repair of the air conditioning system
on my 1986 944T. 
Symptoms: When the air-conditioning system is recharged, it operates normally
for approximately one week and then it does not cool anymore. 
Information: Last summer I took it to the mechanic and he told me that there
was a leak in one of the hoses.
Questions: Any ideas where the problem may be?
Also, the workshop manuals suggest that special equipment should be used
for evacuating, charging and checking the AC. Although, I think this is
necessary can somebody verify this?

thanks,
Tassos Markas

Tassos -

Your mechanic is probably right.  There are three hoses of which the failure of
one or another is usually the cause of 944-series AC woes.  Your mechanic
probably has a Freon sniffer, which is a little electronic tool which makes
geiger-counter like noises in the presence of Freon.  This is how the culprit is
best identified.

The bad news is that a) the hoses are, I'm told, expensive, and b) depending on
which hose needs replacing, it can be a real chore to replace.

Me, if and when I ever get such an AC problem, I plan to have someone vampire
out the remaining Freon.  In Massachusetts, I use the AC all of about two days a
year.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings...

Kevin

In the same vein - any tips on troubleshooting/repairing the rear wiper motor?
(In an 81-931 -- my passenger window motor's broke too :-( )  Haynes warns
about crossing wires to this guy lest you blow out a diode, but beyond that,
nothing.  The meter says that current is getting to the right places, but
nothing's happening.  Also, does Hella still make the wiper/washer kit for
the 924/944 rear end?

you can buy leak detector in most auto parts stores.  you charge the
system and carefully examine all hoses for the red dye which will leak out.

The most effective way to recharge once you fix the leak is to evacuate the
system with a vacuum pump, then recharge it.

good luck

Sounding like an eco-nerd, but what also leaks out with the dye is
the freon. As well, speaking from experience with the dye, a slow leak will not
show up. There are many opportunities for leaks in places that cannot
be visually inspected.
It might cost a bit more (and it might not by the time it's fixed right)
but faulty A/C should be taken to a shop
with a freon recovery evacuation system that will evacuate and save what
freon may be left, do a thorough  leak check by seeing where harmless
helium leaks in, then refill the system.
Generally, a home AC repair has a greater chance of leaking again than one
done by a knowledgeble shop. - If thay have invested in a recovery system
they should know what is what.

Removing the interior door paneling seems very straightforward in the workshop
manual.

1. Remove the interior door handle.  This is apparently done by:

  a. move door handle to fully open position,
  b. unclip a retainer so exposed where the handle pivots,
  c. pull out the moving part of the handle,
  d. remove the rest of the handle by unscrewing a philips head.

2. Remove the window switch cluster and trim.

3. Remove speaker grill and speaker.

4. Unfasten philips head screws as follows:

  a. six along bottom of carpeted cubby,
  b. one at top rear of door panelling,
  c. one at top front of door panelling,
  d. three underneath arm rest, exposed by (a.).

5. Finally, lift panelling up and away from door.

I have no knowledge of troubleshooting the window or rear wiper motors.  As
already mentioned, look for voltage at the motor, and look for electrical
continuity in the motor itself.  If you find both, I would disassemble the motor
assembly to see what's wrong.  You might find that, for example, a pair of gears
has bound.  This happened to my sunroof motor once.  Clean, lubricate,
reassemble.

The electrical harnesses to 944-series doors seem to be prone to the occassional
gremlin.  I don't know why this is.  Check the connectors, in particular, that
the contacts (male and female pins) are clean, and importantly, properly seated
in their shells.  The pins in the connector shells in the side mirrors are prone
to backing out.

Happy hunting... Kevin

Tassos,

I would bet money you have a leak in the high pressure hose connecting
the A/C compressor to the condenser (the coil in front of the
radiator).  This is easy to spot since the hose becomes covered with
oil when this happens.  I have had to replace this hose in both of the
944s I have owned (one of which is an '86 951 like yours).  The cost
to have this hose replaced is about $200, parts and labor.  Although I
am normally very bold in performing my own maintenance and reluctant
to hand over my car to anyone, when it comes to A/C work, I do believe
you need the special equipment to get the job done right, so I "take
it in".  Note that, since the A/C system would be completely
depressurized after replacing the hose, and there is cutoff switch
that disables the compressor if there isn't enough freon, you cannot
use the car's compressor to recharge the system (for example, using a
can of R12 and the inexpensive recharge kits available at any auto
store).  Of course, you could disable the switch, but then you run the
risk of burning up the compressor, which is the reason the switch is
there.  I have also heard that it is important to make sure that you
get the proper amount of freon in the system, which probably requires
the fancy machinery you see in the factory manual.

I guess I'm getting old, or my car is.  I just read a whole, fairly
lengthy issue of the porschephiles digest, with six articles in it, and
they all had to do with things that my car never heard of -- air
conditioning, power windows.

If I can have this reaction, with my 20-year-old 911T, I can imagine how
the 356 folks must feel.

As a 356 owner, I read all these articles and look at the replacement costs
of even small bits and pieces of the newer cars, I can categorically state
that my feeling is one of RELIEF!!

Subject: 951S: Power Loss at 1Bar (just before Turbo kicks in)



This has been a problem that has been plaguing me for a long time now...

At any rate, after a few days of the car sitting around not being
driven, it gets this problem, where under full (or enough to raise the
bar meter high enough) acceleration, it loses power. It feels the same
exact way as when the rev limiter kicks in... I figure it's something
in the turbo system or a bad sensor...

After a little while (20 minutes) of driving, it goes away.

Anybody have any clues?

I had similar behavior with my '87 951 -- for a long time I thought it
was bad gas, or a bad cold start sensor.  The symptoms went away for me
after about 5 minutes (as soon as the temp guage started to register). I
lived with this for about a year, until I had the exhaust gaskets
replaced (had a minor leak) -- all of a sudden, the problem is _gone_!

Subject: CV joints

With all of the recent CV joint conversation going
on I thought I should check mine.

Car: 1980 2V 928 

First the Bad News:
	Of course all four of my CV boots were sliced in half,
	for how long I don't know.

Bad News gets worse:
	Called the dealer who told me that the boots were ~$46.00 a
	piece, But they come with grease and the strap/clamps that 
	close-up the boots on the ends. (I use MOBIL syn. grease and
	will probably use tie-straps instead of clamps, so the extras
	do me no good)  BTW my local club (SMR) Driver's ED Chairmen is
	Tom Green and his boots on his 911 were also ripped.  He told
	me that an independent shops' price was around $45.00 also.

Now the good news:
	Called Automotion who just happened to have (4) in stock and
	the $$.. $10.00 a piece.

Question:
	Any thing I should watch out for when doing the boot replacement?
	I looked in the manual it seems pretty straight forward.
	1: Remove bolts holding CV joint to trans.
	2: Remove bolts holding CV joint to wheel spindle.
	3: Remove clips on half shaft to slide the CV joint out
	4: Clean, Regrease, install new Boot.
	5: steps 3,2,1 to install.

Do I have this correct?

BTW I changed my Trans/Rearend oil with the MOBIL-1 Gear Oil.
The trans seems to have a much crisper feel to it.  I haven't
run it at an event yet and the weather has been pretty lousy here
lately so I'll let you all know if it makes a big difference.

One other note:

Where is the best place to buy the belt tensioning tool?

Automotion wanted ~$500.00 gulp.

I have a set of extra cams I want to play with and I don't
really want to go to the dealer to have them adjust by 
belt tension everytime I want to experiment with my cam.

The 2V 928 motor is a free roller so should I really be
concerned?  By that I mean I know that one of a 944 
owner's worst nightmare is for the belt to pop off.

What makes this tool soo expensive?

Are there 3rd party tools available?

Thanks in advance

Watch out for cheap CV boots - I got one from Tweeks for my 911 and it ripped 
in half during installation (after I got the driveshaft out of the car and
everything apart 8^( ).  Upon closer inspection the boot had the appearance of
being several years old and pretty dry.  It also came looking like it had been
squished and stayed that way.  A second boot from Zim's fixed all that...

A helpful hint: wear a black T-shirt when doing the deed.

A local PCA'er has broken the wind deflector in his Carrera's sunroof.  He'd
like to replace it with a more affordable used part.  Can anyone recommend (or

Don -

> Any thing I should watch out for when doing the boot replacement?

In addition to the steps you outline, you have to line up the inner and outer
races correctly when reassembling.  If memory serves, there are alternating
"large" and "small" spans in the edges of the race circumference, and you have
to line up large with large, etc.  Putting the joints back together is a bit of
a fiddle.

The inner and outer CV's on a 944-series car are identical.  It is normal
practice to flip the halfshafts inner for outer to even out the wear, just like
rotating tires.  Mark the ends before taking them off the car.  Perhaps the same
is true for the 928.

I think that the Haynes 944 manual (normally not one I recommend) and the
Cypress 914, 914/6 manual have really good pictorials on CV joint repacking, as
does the little pamphlet which comes from Lobro with their CV joints.  This is
from memory...

> Where is the best place to buy the belt tensioning tool?

No idea.  Commonly advertised in Pano; scan for the cheapest price.  Automotion
is rarely (maybe never!) the cheapest.

It doesn't pop off.  It shreds its teeth.  Then you shred your hair.

> What makes this tool soo expensive?

Ah, a deep question of free market economics...

More or less...

Step 2: Support the halfshaft with some tie wire or twine.  The joints
are not designed to handle side loads (like the weight of a halfshaft
and a CV joint at the other end...)

Step 3:  The joints are on fairly snug (friction fit).  If you have a
press, it helps.  You don't need a lot of force, just even,
controllable presssure.  I use a grinding tool to mark the relative
location of all the parts of the joint and the shaft before I remove
the clip.  BTW, the clip does tend to go flying when it releases.

Step 4: Have only one CV joint off the shaft at a time.  That will help
to ensure that you do not mix parts from one joint with another. Each
is a matched set.  The only way to completely clean the joint is to
completely disassemble it.  That is also when you can determine whether
or not dirt and grit has damaged the joint and it needs replacing.

Step 5: After completing the installation, spray the boot with some
silicone spray.  It should help keep the boot from drying out.
Make sure that the replacement bolts are the 12 point star type.  The
6 point allen type do not allow you to properly torque them for this
application.  Check the bolts after a couple of hundred miles.
The *do* loosen...

Like Kevin says, wear a black shirt, black pants, black underwear,
black coveralls, and be prepared to throw it all away when you are
done.  The only messier job I have done is replacing a leaking power
steering rack on an Audi 5000.

Give yourself a few hours to get it all done... Good luck...

Check around your local PCA region, especially with the local 944
techies.  One of them should have the tool, which they might lend
you for a while (or rent, etc.)

The reason that it is expensive: You gotta have it!  Uh Huh!

I bought mine from the local porsche dealer for $380 after showing
him the ad in Pano and saying I could either get it from him, or get
it from the ad.  He lowered the price to match the ad.

Subject: Re: Used part sources?


Whenever I've had questions about used parts, I FAXed them to Kempton Bros,
Aase, Stuttgart Haus of parts and Vertex. So far, I have never gotten any
replies from Kempton or Aase. Stuttgart Haus of Parts usually sends me a
letter with the prices and availability. With Vertex, I usually get a
return FAX within the same day and sometimes also a phone call. Vertex
prices are also very reasonable.

I just received the new Automotion catalog in the mail. The prices in this
catalog are VERY high. For example, 911 chain tensioner kit retails for 
over $500 and ignition wire set (CIS) for 911 is over $300. Both these
items could be purchased at Vertex new at less than $500. Why the big
discrepency? But I must admit that the catalog itself is quite slick.

My only problem with Vertex is they don't take Visa/MC

You should include a place out of the chicago area.

Hi,

	I paid my Vertex orders with VISA. The thing is that they
charge 3% for charging. So if you really want to save on the big
orders and you can wait an extra week, a bank draft is probably the
best.

Dear Porschephiles -

I am new to this user group.  I have recently restored a 1967 912,
without AC and other frills of course - lean, mean and clean. I am
quite happy with it.

I notice the number of postings about used parts for Porsches. I have
two questions -

(a).  Is there a database of used porsche part dealers collected from
this mailing group somewhere ?  I am sure this topic has been discussed
before in this august group.

(b). Is there anyone in this group who would periodically like to post
the latest developments in the Porsche world ?  Inside information, usw.

If the answer to part (a) is no, then I would be glad to collect from
the readers of this group information in the following format that
I will post to the group in a month or so.

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.2 CRG PL14c]


hello net.porsche.fans:

my 1985 1/2 944 has been acting strangely lately when it is started after 
sitting during the day (8hrs or so) 

when initially started, with no pressure on the accelerator pedal, the engine
just barely runs until, about 10 seconds later, when it comes up to normal
idle and everything is fine.  sometimes, the engine dies during the 10 seconds.

i was told by my local porsche mechanic that this is the normal cold start
procedure, but when carbon builds up on the valves, this type of problem 
happens.  he recommended having him remove the build up.  i've owned this car
for 2 years and it used to just start roughly but has been getting steadily
worse.

the car has its oil changed every 3000 miles and is serviced regularly.  since
i just had to replace the water pump, i'm wondering what other expensive parts
may need to be replaced now.  :-)

any input is appreciated.

Subject: 944 belt tools sources

Check with Automechanika (in Boulder, CO) or Race Force (in
Emeryville, CA).  I recall both of these sources offering the tool for
under $400 at some point in the recent past (I paid $360 to
Automechanika for mine a few years ago).  I don't have any of my
magazines (e.g., Pano) in my office now, so I can't check the current
prices (or give the phone numbers).  However, I have been watching the
prices for a number of years and have not seen much movement; you
should not have to pay $500.  I have never seen any aftermarket
substitutes.

BTW, here is a useful technique.  Whenever the idea of spending $360
on a tool started to bother me, I simply opened my desk drawer and
pulled out the invoices showing how much I used to pay a mechanic
(with the tool) to have my water pump, engine seals, and belts 
replaced/tensioned.  This always gets me through the crisis.

I am currently looking for a 911. Yes. I am tiring of fixing the 931. :-)
Upshot:  If anyone runs across any "good deals" on any 911 newer than 1981,
in reasonable geographic range of Kingston, Canada, Please let me know.
I guess that would restrict it to upstate NY, western Quebec, southern Ontario.
And, the 931 is officially proclaimed for sale although I may not willingly
part with it before I have another Porsche to replace it. I just wouldn't feel
right driving a substitute, even though I am told that Jeeps are great for
going to get parts.  ;-)

One reason why the air/fuel mixture gets enriched during start-up is wetting of
the cylinder walls and intakes.  Instead of staying mixed with the air and
burning, a certain amount of fuel leaves the mixture, coats the walls, and leans
out the mixture.  Carbon build-up on the valves will, as I understand it,
exacerbate the situation beyond the system's ability to compensate.  The mixture
is overly lean and the engine will run rough.

The cure is blasting the valves with walnut shells.  The prevention is periodic
use of Techron.  There is disagreement about whether Techron will clean up
existing deposits over time, but it certainly inhibit further build-up.

This could be a lot of other things as well.  If, as you decribe, the problem
corrects itself in about ten seconds, then it might be a bad check valve at the
fuel pump or a marginal fuel pressure regulator.  These guys should keep
pressure in the fuel system after engine shut-down.  Doing so is a big part of
inhibiting vapor lock.  Your rough running occurs while the fuel pump works to
re-establish pressure and purge vapor from the system.  Checking for this is
very simple; your mechanic can help you.

Just to be clear, rough running during cold- or hot-start of a 944 is not
normal.  Absent any of these problems, the car will start up like a charm
regardless of whether it or the weather is hot or cold.

In the San Francisco Bay area, Partsheaven is a good source of used and
some new parts.  I recently bought a new fuel pump from them for my 931
for about $120 (around $250 at Automotion, I think).  You can find
their ad in the back of Excellence each month.  Great place to browse.
They bring in a car and completely disassemble it.  All parts are on
the shelf.  Only Porsche parts, all models.

Zim's in Ft. Worth Texas also has some good prices on new parts.

Automotion...  Watch out for these guys.  I received their slick new
catalog about a week ago.  After shopping around a few places, I did
find a few parts that were either a little cheaper than other places or
that I could only find from them.  As soon as I placed the order, I
find that the prices in the NEW catalog are a "bit" higher.  To compare
prices, a set of Jurad front brake pads at Automotion is $118.00.  Zim's
wanted $79.00.  Vertex only wanted $59.00.  Similar price discrepancy
for the rear.

Here's a challenge for the techies:  I have had a problem with the 931 that
I always blamed on the waste gate. Just as the car would come on boost and
really become FUN, it would cough and die until the RPM dropped sufficiently
and then it would kick in again giving a real jack rabbit effect at about
3800 to 4000 RPM.  Gary Cooke suggested that I check out the boost limit
switch, which shuts down the fuel pump to prevent overboost. Today I made
two changes at the same time. First, I discovered that there was a broken
hose connection in a vacuum line that hooks up to the charcoal canister behind
the front wheel. This line goes to the fuel tank to slurp vapors off the tank
and run them through the intake. I fixed that. Before I started it up, I put
a jumper wire onto the lead from the boost limit switch and connected it to
ground. Then I took a test drive.  ROCKET SHIP  :-)   !  No more HICCUPS.
I reconnected the limit switch and still no hiccups. Works like it is supposed
to. But I still don't know if the limit switch is faulty or if I just fixed
a poor electrical contact inadvertently. Could it be that the broken hose
caused this condition? Since it hooks right into the air intake/filter housing
I don't fully understand how this could be the culprit. Sure  puzzles me.
I'd love to hear plausible explanations because with the number of times the
connection to the limit switch has been tested, I don't think that was the
cause of the problem. Color me confused.   :-/   ken.

In British Cars Digest #435, Shel Hall writes:

    Even loving them as much as I do, I haven't owned a Britcar since I sold
    my last Bugeye in '68.

    BUT I STILL HAVE THE DAM' PARTS!

    For 24 years, I've been moving a couple of boxes of Britcar parts
    around with me, saving them against the day when I'd have another.

The syndrome doesn't afflict just former British car owners. I used to be up
to my elbows in old Porsches (mostly 356s). I haven't had anything for a few
years, but I still have an old Fuhrman cam (from a roller-crank 1500S), a
pre-A diaphragm clutch out of a Carrera, one Koni shock (front, from a '55
Speedster), and at least part of a 911 tool kit from a '67 S. I'm sure if I
dug around I'd find a few other odds'n'ends. Oh yes, a Tweeks 356A front
fender brace and a bunch of books... I cart 'em around from house to house,
just like Shel Hall relates.

I rarely even consider buying an old Porsche anymore, what with the
stratospheric prices. (I can still find the odd early 911 or 912 coupe,
usually overpriced, but forget any 356 ragtop.) These old parts are likely
to be my only connection to a once fun hobby, pretty much destroyed by
speculators.

At least I can still afford to subscribe to the Porsche and British car
mailing lists. The price hasn't gone up on them yet.

Subject: 944 Prices

Can I get a sampling from some cooperative individuals around the
country on AD prices for 83-85 944s and 86 turbos?

I have noticed a rise (I think) in the DC paper from a low of $3500-4200
in january to about $5000 or so recently for the inexpensive models.

I am looking for a cheap 944 to turn into a track car and would like to
spend as little as possible.  Cosemetics realtively unimportant as long
as tyhe body is straight.

Anyway, curious as to sunday paper prices in LA, SF, Pacific North West,
Fl, and wherever else people are willing to look.

Thanks in advance!

        Steve

Subject: Texas Old Car Race

Wow! No thunderstorms, no floods, no tornados. Warm temperatures. Would 
be hard to get better weather. Which is not saying there were no 
problems. It was busy, and fun, and tiring. And there were some really
pretty cars there. As they say, "You should'a been there."

Enjoy -

                            Texas Old Car Race '92
                                  April 24-26
 
      The third Texas Old Car Race, a Greatrace, Ltd. event, was three days of
GAR-style old car rallying based out of Irving, a Dallas suburb. Director of
Competition John Classen wrote the three loops. The competition staff included
members of the Maverick Region, PCA, and Greatrace staff. I was driven around
by my wife, Pat, as the Lead #2 car, busily pounding my Alfa TSD computer
confirming milages and times, rehanging curve arrow signs, propping up fallen
Stop signs, etc.
 
      Ralliests who have never done a Greatrace event need a brief explanation
to truely appreciate these competitors and the cars they drive. There are only
three rally computers on the course, in Lead #1 and Lead #2 and Fast Sweep
doing verification. Allowed equipment on board a competition vehicle is: (1) a
non-correctable speedometer; (2) one time of day clock (leave your
wristwatches at home); (3) one stop watch; (4) one thermometer; and (5) a pad
of clean unruled paper with writing implements. Period. No calculating
equipment other than your brain, and no odometer. There is a speedo check
instead of an odo check. Think of it at TS rallying, not TSD. All controls are
passage; they don't stop and they get no feedback on their performance until
after they finish. Timed in seconds, the raw scores are impressive. Then
factors are applied based on the vehicle's age. Some raw scores even beat what
John and I would get on our computers - and we had built the courses! (OK, I
helped build only two of them.)
 
Day 1

      It all started with the Trophy Run, a warm up event scored separately
from the next two days; separate awards; also used for a tie breaker. It ran
north into Oklahoma then turned west and south to reenter Texas at the very
next bridge over the Red River, over 50 miles west. I was a little
disappointed with the Oklahoma section. Seems there were two reduced speed
zones and a Y intersection (sort of) that needed instructions. Else two
consecutive route instructions could have read "Ryan 52" (as in the miles to
Ryan), and "Ryan City Limit". Talk about a confidence leg... Considering we
were only a half hour past lunch when that long (boring) run began, I had to
push some Dixieland in the tape deck to keep us awake. The route was 291.08
miles, 275.64 miles under the clock, with six controls.
 
Race Image: Pushing In. Curtis Graf had his 1916 Packard Roadster, usually a
very reliable vehicle, die on him with a dead battery. The video tape from
control 5 clearly shows the haul truck come in, followed by Curtis and Bruce
Gezon pushing the Packard across the line (for a max), with fast sweep
providing rear cover. After making the control, they put is on the haul truck
to finish the day.
 
Day 2

      The first day of the Championship Run was busy and tiring for everyone.
In addition to the TOCR competition, Curtis Graf had organized a charity event
benefitting the Muscular Dystrophy Association, which added several more cars
to the back of the field. The course ran east out of Dallas before turning
south and finally west to cross the Brazos River southwest of Fort Worth
before heading back in. Unbeknownst to them, they also prechecked a section of
my upcoming Bluebonnet Trails event (May 2); seems I'd shown John a narrow old
bridge across the Brazos that I'd found... (Even our local events haven't used
it - the maps don't show it clearly, and have the road marked as unpaved,
which it isn't.) 
 
      After the bridge, the county struck, unpaving (!) a road since I'd been
there a week before. It was on the route, of course. The options were not
good. Competitors needed instructions to get them around the problem, not an
easy task given the tulip-like intruction format, and it was a very long way
to a NRI referencing a sign for a possible TOD restart. If we just ended it
and sent them home the fastest way, they'd easily arrive before the welcoming
arrangements and traffic control were ready. John finally decided to end the
competition and I dictated some emergency routes to get them around the
problem and back on the course. Pat and I drove the emergency route to verify
it, then headed back up the course in warp. We established an Obs control just
five minutes before the first car arrived. It was a little hectic there as the
cars stacked up waiting their chance to copy the emergency routes. The full
course was supposed to be 312 miles, with 261.03 under the clock. We only lost
one of the planned six controls when we stopped the competition at 235 miles
(actually, the fifth control was at 226.79, but we didn't have time to get any
closer to it and still setup the Obs).
 
      Race Image: But, Officer. You'd hope the police would know something
about vehicle laws. Not always. One good citizen in some little burg called
the local gendarms to report an unlicensed vehicle running down the road -
some old car carrying a 1936 license plate! Said vehicle, or at least another
one carrying '36 plates, was successfully stopped and interrogated. Cop didn't
know the plates were legal as long as the registration stickers on the
windshield are up to date, but finally let himself be convinced. A delay claim
was filed, and allowed. Sorry, there were several '36s running and I didn't
catch which one, or which burg.
 
      Race Image: Are Y'all Going... One team was motoring along and was
overtaken by a civilian lady in a modern land yacht. She wouldn't pass. Two
lane road, she pulls alongside, waving. Team looks, waves back, continues on.
Again she does it. And again. Finally, on their rear bumper, she's flashing
her lights and waving frantically. Team decides that, well, maybe she's trying
to warn them of a problem with their car, and pulled to a stop. Navigator goes
back to check. Lady asks, "Are y'all going to a rallye?" They made up the
time.
 
      Race Image: Self-Roasted Beef. A bit of smoke was coming up from that
corral by the road. Not really a fire yet, the dry grass all over it was
smoldering and smoking, probably too moist to burn. And the cattle were just
standing there in it, or wandering around, when I passed. Many jokes. Several
pictures reported taken. Competitors reported several cows laying down in it,
calmly looking around. Well, I've always said cows were as dumb as a saddle-
bag full of rocks.
 
      Race Image: Your Computer Says What? Saturday afternoon we're running
along, not in warp, but still making good time, when Rachel and John pass us
in the Greatrace Suburban. And I thought we were miles ahead of them. Grab the
radio to find John worrying because his Timewise has suddenly started reading
long. Not an extra hundreth mile or so, but long by 0.14, and diverging
eratically from the log. My Alfa is tracking dead on. By the next control,
he's reading well over a quarter mile long. No explanation for the extra
ticks. His mileage is off in Never Never Land when the course collapses a
little later. Running in, he did a reset and the problem continued. That
evening the Surburban died and had to be jump started to even be moved. After
calling Timewise Central, he calls me with the report. Seems the Timewise will
get extra pulses if it doesn't have enough voltage, as in its only getting 7
or 8 volts. That's how I understood him, anyway. Timewise pilots be
forewarned. Maybe Alfa Central can predict behavior, but I suspect my Alfa
would just go belly up eventually.
 
Race Image: Green Light. The charity event threw a good barbecue spread for
competitors and staff in the evening. Afterwards, the cars departed back to
the headquarters hotel. C E Butridge has done some serious engine work on his
car and challenged Dick Belveal. So they drag raced all the way back, a couple
of miles. On city streets. They never said which won, C E's green 1936 Buick
Coupe or Dick's red 1936 Buick Coupe...
 
 
Day 3

      The last day was for all the marbles, 207.68 miles, 164.69 under the
clock, and five controls. The route ran north then turned east before looping
back. The course was more difficult - John always saves something for the last
day. Leg three really decided the winners. Some twisty roads worked the
navigators, with CAST-down-for-a-time at curve advisories. But they'd seen
that. There was a "quick sign"; well, not really quick, but they weren't back
up to speed yet after a stop and turn, and that sign started a CAST-for-a-time
run. Then there was the final CAST-down-for-a-time. It wasn't just a pause -
the control was inside the reduced CAST zone. After that leg, the top
finishers were already decided.
 
      Race Image: Wildflower Fever. The Texas roadsides are still awash in
wildflowers. The blues and oranges are fading, but the whites and yellows are
coming on strong. Many out-of-staters were impressed. Rachel (from the LA
area) and Pat, who take care of John and I respectively, were scouring the
roadsides at controls with my field guide. They identified about 30 and found
some not in the book. Well, it only has about 350 color photos, and there are
about 2500 flowering plants growing wild in Texas.
 
      Race Image: Special Award Time. Gary Lillard deserves special mention
for two awards he was given. Gary suffered a stroke a few months ago, and with
it major memory loss. He's still slow of speech and walk, but has a gleam in
his eye and a smile. He hadn't forgotten rallying, the fun, and the people,
but he had forgotten how to rally. And the doctors told him not to rally.
Nope, he sat in front of the training videos for hours on end, trying to bring
it back. Rookie navigator Rick Curlett helped. They did not place well, but
they finished. For his feat, Gary was given both the Spirit of Texas award,
given to the person best symbolizing the spirit of the event, and the Texas
Tough award, given to the team overcoming the worst difficulties to compete.

Subject: 928 CV Boot summary


Took care of the CV boots of the 928 this weekend (yes it is a very
dirty job).  Once again a tribute to P-car engineering in that you can
actually take the CV joint completely apart instead of doing a
half-a** spray clean job like on other makes.

As Kevin said putting the CV joint back together is a bit tricky but
if all else fails pull out the manual.

The Siliconing of the boots prior to installation is a must (thanks
George).

Thanks to all who responded.

Subject: 914 bolt pattern and offset
Message-Id:  <9204280557.aa10541@wes.on.ca>

I'm having some potentially interesting ideas about the wheels on my 914
(it has 205/60R15 on 15x7 wheels, but they will rub unless I get flares).
I'm thinking of having the hubs drilled and tapped to accommodate wheels
from another type of vehicle (yes, another German one).  

But before deciding to go ahead with this, I need to know some things. 
Can someone tell me what the proper offset would be for a 914 (using a 
15x6 wheel)?  And how much can I deviate from it without running into
handling, clearance or tire wear problems?

Oh, and what IS the 914 bolt circle?  It certainly looks a lot bigger than
the 4x100mm used by the water-cooled models.  Is it 4x130?

Any information greatly appreciated!

Don't know the offset and, in chasing wheels myself recently,
discovered no one around here remembered either. However:

The stock steels are 15x6.5JJ. I can stuff a 195x60 under the rear just
fine. But 205x60s rubbed on the rear inside on both sides under hard
cornering, and a little on the front inside if I hit a bump while
turned to the locks. Others around here have had similar problems,
while others have been OK with 205s.

The Fuchs alloys are slightly different, but again no one remembers the
numbers. The effect, though, is that you can stuff 205x60s under all 4
corners without rubbing. So they say - I've no personal experience with
them, yet. I picked up a set of Fuchs at a swap meet recently and will
mount them after the 914 gets its engine redone and put back in.

>Oh, and what IS the 914 bolt circle?  It certainly looks a lot bigger than
>the 4x100mm used by the water-cooled models.  Is it 4x130?

Yep - 4x130 - and there aren't many aftermarkets in that size at
present. Just VW stuff. I found some factory alloy look-alikes, but
they were heavier than the stock steels. The VW wheels the original
owner slapped on mine had such a bad offset that you couldn't get
anything wider than the factory stock 175s under the rear end without
rubbing the outside. Or were they 165s? Not enough rubber anyway.

>Any information greatly appreciated!

One trick some of our folks have pulled to cure minor rubbing on the
outside rear and avoid flares involves a 2x4 placed horizontally along
the inside lip. Judicious application of a rubber mallet along the 2x4
has produced the desired extra clearance without noticable deformation.
I recommend against doing this yourself unless you're used to doing
body work. We've got a couple of body men around here that will do it
after hours, at the track, etc, for a beer or two.

Good luck -

To my knowledge, all of the stock 914 wheels on the later cars were
15x5.5 (some early cars had 15x4.5 steel wheels, I believe). All of
the alloy wheels (Fuchs, Pedrini, etc as well as the steel wheels)
were 15x5.5, and all had the same offset (but I don't have a number
on the tip of my tongue).

I ran 205/60-15 tires from several different manufacturers on stock
wheels (originally 15x5.5 steel, later Fuchs) under hard track driving
conditions without a problem. There may be an issue with the small
variations between different manufacturers, and there could well be
brands which are somewhat larger than the ones I tried. The largest
issue is clearly the rear camber setting. At anything less than 2 Deg.
or so negative, I had plenty of inside clearance, both statically and
dynamically (eg on the track). At about 2 1/2 Deg., I had clearance
in the paddock, but after running I would find traces of rubbing
between the inside of the tire and the inside fender well. There
could also be small variations from chassis to chassis which could
make the difference.

>

As I mentioned above, I don't think the Fuchs (4 bolt) are any
different.

>Yep - 4x130 - and there aren't many aftermarkets in that size at

Don't run the Fuchs alloy reproductions under hard driving (like
track events or autocrosses). they are cast, not forged, and much
weaker. The 911 fake Fuchs have been known to break. I don't have
direct information on the 914 ones, but I would worry.

All of the VW-based wheels with the same bolt circle have a much
larger offset (as noted), and essentially limit you to 165 tires,
perhaps 185 with clever choices of camber. They are advertised for
914's but avoid them like the plague, at least for performance
applications where tire size counts.

This works, but only if the problem is at the outside, which
typically won't be the case with stock wheels. I believe Chuck Stoddard
got 15x7 (5 bolt) wheels under his trick 914-6 using this technique
and careful selection of camber.

I had a set of fuchs alloys on my old 914 - you can tell the difference between
them and reproductions because the repros (at least all I've ever seen) paint
every other "spoke" black...the originals are all polished spokes.  The fuchs
are 15x5.5 .

I had 195/65 or 195/60's on the back of my car (General XP2000's) which had
raised lettering on one side, placed on the inside for aesthetic purposes.  The
lettering would rub the inside of the frame causing an annoying rhythmic thump.
After a year or so the lettering wore off and the problem went away.  I
can't imagine putting 205's on the back without serious trial-and-error
alignment and maybe a little fender flaring.

Subject: 944 AC Compressor

Just as I start getting some cash set aside to do my clutch.........
my AC compressor starts squeaking when it engages and when it gets hot
there is a distinct humming sound and vibration that can be felt in the
clutch pedal, turn of the AC and it goes away.  I think my compressor is
about to detonate.  My questions are:

1) Has anyone had any experience with the Standen compressor?  There is a
add in Pano by ICE advertising a "compressor changeover kit Bosch to Standen
for $399" Sounds like a good price but is the compressor a piece of junk?

2) What about a used compressor, am I asking for trouble? I think Kempton
Bro's has the best price on a new compressor for $429 but please correct
me if I'm wrong.

3) Installation looks like a piece of cake but I really don't want 
to punch another hole in the ozone layer by venting all of my
freon, so I guess I'll have to take the car in and have it done.  What
have others paid for a compressor swap?

Pretty wide spread, I'd say, but the $5,400 '85 sounds like it really

BTW.
 
If what you want is a "core" to build into a racer, I expect you'd take
one with a dud engine, right?  I'd call all the local Porsche shops and
tell 'em you're looking; surely they will run across one with a broken
timing belt, bad rod bearing, or something else that might make an
old, ratty car "not worth fixing."
 
Good luck.  I'll be happy to help if you want one from here.

Okay, here's the factory Porsche backspacings:
	356A/B			3-3/4"  (95mm)
	356C			4-1/2" (115mm)
	911, 912, 930		4-7/8" (125mm)
	Early 911 7" mag	5-1/8" (130mm)
	914-4			4-5/8" (120mm)
	914-6			4-7/8" (125mm)
	924 4-bolt		4-5/16" (110mm)
	928			6-5/8" (170mm)
	944 Cookie Cutter style	4-7/8" (125mm)

Note that those are backspacings (distance from inside edge of wheel to hub
mounting face).  Put the wheel face down on the ground, without a tire
mounted.  Lay a straight edge across the wheel, and measure the distance
from that to the hub mounting face.  To convert to offset, subtract the
backspacing from half of the rim width.  (I think I got the sign on that
right...)

For my 914 autocrosser, I'm using 15x8" wheels with 205/50-15 tires with a
5.5" backspacing.  Of course, I don't actually have these on the car yet, so
maybe they won't fit.  I'm pretty sure I'll have to flare the fenders, but I
don't think I'll need spacers.

4x130mm.  The 911 is 5x130mm.  The 4x130mm is, as you say, shared with most
of the VW air-cooled cars and the 914/4.

Nope, the stock 914/4 wheels are 15x5.5.  Some 1.7's came with 15x4.5, with
the wider wheels as an option.  All the alloy wheels are 15x5.5.

Subject: 944 Power Steering Groaning

My power steering groans, particularly when cold or
under hard cornering conditions. I've been told that
this could be a power steering return hose that has
collapsed internally and is causing the pump to bleed
off its excess pressure and groan. Can anyone confirm
this? If so, there are two return hoses. One from the
rack to the reservoir and one from the reservoir to the 
cooling coils. Which one is most likely?

This might also be related to fluid that continually seems
to evaporate/boil/overflow out of the reservoir and
soak the foam padding under the hood (even though I never
refill the reservoir).


Thanks in advance,

Mark

Subject: 914's and trailers

It's an odd question, but ...

Any idea how to put a trailer hitch on a 914, capable of pulling a trailer
weighing ~400 pounds (~180 kilos)?

I don't really think it's possible or feasible, but I thought I'd ask.

I once asked a competent 914 mechanic about this (I was toying with the
idea of getting a hitch just so I could use a certain type of bike
rack).  He said he didn't think it would be wise.

The most non-invasive thing I could think of was to bolt something to
the back of the tranny where the muffler bracket ('boomerang') attaches.
Of course, I wasn't thinking of actually towing anything with it.

I am no expert in these matters.  I read something recently which strongly
advised against welding and redrilling hubs, in this case, to accomodate
five-bolt wheels on original four-bolt hubs.  Safety, you know.  It certainly is
more expensive than buying the 914/6 hubs, of course.  I think 'European Car'
ran an article showing how to do this recently; didn't read it so I could be
mistaken.

Someone else commented regarding the imitation Fuchs alloys.  They do indeed
have a history of failure, and our PCA region has decided starting this year to
outlaw them at the track.  Enforcement should be real interesting...  There are
plenty of well-made non-OEM rims.  It's just these counterfeits which are very
suspect.

If I were looking to max out the rubber on my 914, I'd ask someone running one
in SCCA ITA.  Locally, Gary and Barbara Edwards do just this with some sort of
aftermarket rims.  I'm sure they haven't modified the hubs a) for safety, b)
because it isn't allowed in ITA, and c) I'm sure they don't want so spend the
money!  If you're interested, I could ask them what they wear.

Frank said, in effect, that not all 205's are the same; quite true.  Biggest
thing to look for is tread width (205 => 20.5 cm.) versus section width, which
is I believe the max width of the tire - as the sidewall bulges.

I don't know exactly how he did it, but, a friend mounted a trailer

I haven't seen him for a couple of years, don't have his phone number,

If you are DESPERATE, send me some email and I may be able to track

Precision Products used to have a  trailer hitch kit for 914's. I basicly
attached to the engine and transmission mount points, and seemed to
work pretty well. I have a friend who used to tow a 911 race car
to events behind his 914 so I don't think a bike would be a problem.

I haven't seen the kit advertised for years though. You might try J.C.
Whitney, since they often have such weird stuff....

Hi there.  Anybody ever had any trouble with getting 914 engine covers
to close?  Mine seems to want to rub the edge of the trunk lid when I
try to close it - it's to the point now where I can't get it down to
the latch (and therefore I finally have to do something about it).  If
anybody can offer some tips on what adjustments I need to make to the
hinges, I'd be much obliged - I've never messed with it before.  Or
maybe the problem is that somehow the trunk lid has shifted forward?
Any ideas?

There was a terrific article in Nordstern region's newsletter a bunch of years
back, I think by Bill Cauldwell but I suspect almost certainly in collusion with
Kim Crumb.  There is (was?) a factory kit for putting a trailer hitch on a 928. 
If memory serves, the kit was created at the behest of Ferry P.  Its
installation was a joyless task; the article very amusing!

You can adjust this at the hinge mount brackets on the fire wall. The
cover mount point is a slot. Loosen the bolt (from the bottom - the top
is a nut attached to the bracket), push the cover forward to the right
spot and tighten it back up. If nothing's stripped or broken, that's
all there is to it. I found that one of my bracket nuts was stripped,
so I slipped a smaller diameter bolt thru with a washer and keeper nut
on both the top and bottom and snugged that down. A little awkward (not
a lot of room), but it held fine until a proper repair could be made
(remove the cover and replace the nut...).

Well lubrication of the transaxle would not be a probelm for 250 miles
since the lower shaft (output) will still spin, thus sloshing oil about
as all the gears turn.

As for wasting $30....where can I get the $0.12 per mile flatbed rate?!?

	I recently took the car ferry to Ireland to visit my Dad. As they
pack the cars in quite tightly, I decided to turn the wing mirrors
on my 944 inwards so that people wouldn't keep hitting them as they
pushed past.

	Sadly, as I turned the passenger door mirror, it went "crack" and
then all loose ... it was only staying held together by the internal
wiring. I hadn't brought any tools (or my Haynes manual) to Dublin
with me, so I put on a brave face and went to Ireland's only
official Porsche centre (if you saw Dublin traffic you'd know why a
passenger door mirror is *essential*).

	The mechanic took about 20 mins to fix the mirror (the spring
tensioned threaded column with holds it all together had come undone
after the bakelite ring at the base had broken), and there was no
charge!!!!!

	So if anyone reads this in Ireland (or anyone is bringing their
Porsche over on holiday), I can recommend Braemor Motors on the
Churchtown Road in Dublin.

P.S. I was told that they sell very few cars at the moment. The sum
total I saw there (and these are the sole importers!) was a 911 and
a 944 being serviced, and two 911s for sale - an '87 Targa in Red
with 43k miles at IR#39,500 (about US$63,200) and an '82 coupe in
Platinum with 69k miles at IR#19,500 (about US$31,200).

Subject: 944 Power Steering Groaning

My power steering groans, particularly when cold or
under hard cornering conditions. I've been told that
this could be a power steering return hose that has
collapsed internally and is causing the pump to bleed
off its excess pressure and groan. Can anyone confirm
this? If so, there are two return hoses. One from the
rack to the reservoir and one from the reservoir to the
cooling coils. Which one is most likely?

This might also be related to fluid that continually seems
to evaporate/boil/overflow out of the reservoir and
soak the foam padding under the hood (even though I never
refill the reservoir).


Thanks in advance,

Mark

The hinges on the engine cover bolt to tabs sticking out from the
firewall just under the rear window.  The mounting holes are elongated
to allow the engine-lid-to-trunk-lid clearance to be adjusted.  Just
take a large screwdriver to the underside of these tabs to loosen,
adjust, and re-tighten the hinges.

I have seen lots of 914s with bent or broken tabs, usually suffering
from rust damage.
