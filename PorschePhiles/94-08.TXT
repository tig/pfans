Hmmm. . . wonder if there's a market out there for this kid Porsche 
books.  After all, they sell those motorized mini Porsches at FAO 
Schwartz for something like $6000 and people buy them.  How 'bout "The 
Little Red Porsche that Could"?

Subject: re:Vic Elford's book



I bought Vic Elford's book a few weeks ago after reading reviews of it (I
can't remember if it was Excellence or 356 Registry). I was somewhat
disappointed with it for the following reason:
	-The title says "Porsche High Performance Driving Handbook" but it
was very generic in its applications, i.e. no hints on how to use trailing
throttle oversteer or other (mostly) Porsche-specific characteristics to your
advantage.
	On the other hand, the book has some very interesting Porsche racing
anecdotes and some photos that aren't seen in the usual Porsche books.
This alone may make the book worthwhile but I guess I was expecting
something else.

I just finished building a 2 litre for my 914, and following Stan's advice
I used a FAT camshaft for it and was quite happy with the results up til
now. Today while driving it, it made a strange rattling sound (sorry I
can't be more specific) and then experienced a loss in power. A backfiring
sound from the righthand carb lead me to do a compression test which
revealed 0psi for #3. I pulled the valve cover off and found a broken
valve spring (I used new FAT single heavy duty springs) and the end of the
valve stem sitting at the bottom of the head. The valve stem broke off at
the collet groove closest to the head. The engine has 250 miles on it (I'm
still breaking it in (somehow a very appropriate expression today!) and
the heads I used were rebuilt units with reground valves. The valves
looked to be in very good condition (It was the intake valve that broke).
I don't remember the actual clearance but I checked the springs for coil
bind. Has anyone out there had a similar breakage or any idea as to what
caused this breakage?

A further item for thought: If Loctite is so damn good, how come I can
always get the lid off?

Thanks,

Subject: Re:: Gas price - GB speed limits

Bob,
	The speed limits are 60 and 70 as stated BUT doing 100 on the motorway
gets a little dodgy - the unmarked police cars (not playing fair) will get a
little playfull if they spot you and then..... heavy fine and/or a ban. Its
"OK" at 80mph but above that we are heading towards dangerous ground. Also
we are getting very serious about Gatso - a radar controlled camara which just
snaps away all day counting those fines. These things will pay for themselves 
in weeks and all that profit is making the old governments eyes twinkle, how
long before speed limits are enforced by weekening our pockets or is this just
paranoia???????

Subject: 911 Hesitation

Dear Porschephilers:
	There has been some recent talk on the net about late model
911 ('84 and up Carreras) missing. It seems to happen at about 3k and it 
feels like a sligth hesitation.

Even though, I'm not experiencing this problem here are my $.02 worth:

I did my 30K tune up this weekend and I noticed that there is a set
centrifugal advance weights under the cover in the distributor. 

I noticed that in my car, they seem to be riding on Teflon like bushings.
I cleaned up the old grease and used some WD-40. This kind-of got me
thinking about the reported hesitation. 

Could it be that the mechanical advance be sticking inside the distributor?
Are they not supposed to advance timming somewhere around 3K.

I might be completly off base, but what the heck! It might be worth looking
into it.

Subject: Piston rings - Dumb question?


Hi all-

Picked up a new set of pistons for the 931 last week.   As is usually the 
case with these
sets, they came with wrist pins and with rings installed.  The _dumb_ 
question is:
Can I be confident that the end-gap on the rings will be correct when I 
install the pistons, or do I need to lever the rings off, check them in the 
bores and lever them all back on before installing the pistons?

I'm inclined to believe that the rings should be checked, but if this is 
true, why the heck does Mahle install them on the pistons instead of just 
including them in the box?

Thanks

Oooo. Not good. The good news is that FAT stands behind their products,
something at least some of their competitors does not. So give them a
call, pronto.

Where did you get the heads? I've seen some "racing heads" come from
some of the name brand shops on the Left Coast that I wouldn't take in
as cores - things like the valves not sealing and the valve stems being
completely worn out. It could be that you have a dead valve in that
the stem was too worn to reuse. I could be that there was some other
related problem causing the valve to break.  I've seen valves from
engines with bad rocker geometry break from years of being pushed 
up and down at an odd angle, usually on the retainer grooves.

BTW, that's *ONE* reason I use new valves. Sure, the exhaust valves are
$90 each but what's it going to cost (in time and effort as well as cash)
to fix this little mishap?

Subject:  HELP! Buying a used '83 944


        I just test drove a 1983 Porsche 944, and I need some advice 
on the car since I have never owned or driven a 944 until today.


        Here are the facts and my observations.

                * 1983 Porsche 944 (no turbo)
                * 37K original miles
                * Price: $6000 (he will not go down in price)

            The paint and interior are in great shape(minor cracks in 
dash)

        ITEMS OF CONCERN:

        - Around 70 MPH the car develops a slight vibration in the 
steering wheel. The car still feels very stable and tracks well when 
this is occuring but the vibration is a little annoying. My guess is 
that it might be a wheel balance problem.

          Does anyone know of wheel vibration being a problem in these 
Porsches?

        - At idle the car picks up a vibration from the motor mount. 
The owner claims this is a weakness in the design, and new updated 
mounts are available.

          Does anyone know how much parts would cost to replace the 
mounts?

Final question: Does this car sound like a good deal?

        Any response is appreciated..

Thanks,
Tim

Subject: tight plugs

All,

     I'm doing a valve adjust/tuneup on the '83 911.  Removing
the spark plugs (should be trivial, right?) turned out to be very
difficult.  The plugs are TIGHT all the way out!  By tight, I
mean that using a normal 3/8 drive ratchet with normal length
handle, it is very difficult to rotate the socket.  Cylinders 3
and 6 are the worst (of course).  Inspection of the plugs once
removed, show no sign of stripping or other problems - no
aluminum filings.

     Background:  This is the second time I've changed the plugs.
The car has 120k on it, so this SHOULD be about the 8th time
they've been changed.  Last time I did it, they were snug, #6
being the worst.  I used no-sieze last time, although I
understand that isn't recommended now.  However given how tight
they are, I'm confident I would have galling if I hadn't used it.
This time they are tighter than last time (by memory).

     What is going on here?  There is no way of looking into the
hole, short of some sort of hi-tech fibre-optic device.  Anyone
else had this problem?  I'd sure like to avoid eventually ruining
a head!

P-netters,
        In the process of doing some rust damage repairs, I have decided
to remove all the underbody sealant from the car and fuel tank.  Using
the net wisdom most recently given, the removal has gone relatively
easy, especially when rust is present.
        Now, the question is, do I spray new sealant on the bare metal,
or is there some special primer that should be applied.  I was thinking
of using a good galvanized primer and then the sealant and then body color
paint.  Any advice?

I believe they are 59,000 US dollars, also they are twice as much in 
Japan, about ni sen mon en, 20000000 Yen or, 200,000 US dollar equivalent 
for a 993.

There are also differences, for example, I read in a review that the UK 
993 has smaller wheels than the US and Japan versions.

Subject: Front brake pad replacement


I replaced the front brake pads on my 88 911 Carrera (Guards Red).

The only reference I had was the Haynes manual, so I was
somewhat suprised to find no retaining clips in the large
retaining pins that go through the pads, hold down the
cross-spring and locate in the caliper. The Haynes manual
did not mention any other retaining device, but did have
a picture of a disk, caliper, pins and clips.

Having drifted out the pins I examined them, and found little
metal sleeves around the end of the retaining pins that locate
in the outside (ie side you drift the pins in from) of the caliper.
I presume that these lock the pins into the caliper.

My question: Should I have replaced the pins and the little sleeves,
or was it ok to put them back in? They were in good condition,
and I did not mangle them getting them out or putting them back,
I just have underlying anxiety about whether these were throw
away items. They seemed to go in solidly enough, are they about
to fall out?

914 hoses & components
    Hi, again.

Valve swapped from what they had been before, as per the

    How does the decel valve work?  I assume that the hose
from the side is the "control" pressure, and it opens or
closes a valve between the front and back hoses...  True?
Which pressure *should* be the "control" pressure?
    Which fitting on the vaccuum unit is advance, and which
is retard?  (I'd check by mouth, but I don't want to suck on
old, dirty vaccuum hoses...)  One should be supplied vaccuum
from before the throttle, one from after--which is which???
    Thanks!!

Subject: 911 engine removal

Hi P-filers.  First stage of my tensioner/clutch/stud project: removing
the engine/tranny, de-mating the engine and tranny and removal of ancillary
components is complete.  Total time around 16 hours including building 
the dolly, next time it will take 8.  The following are my notes.  I will
post similar notes at the completion of each stage.  I expect to have the
following stages:
   1.   removal and demating of engine and tranny and removal of
             ancillary components from engine
   2.   basic disassembly of engine and removal of busted components and
             examination and testing of remaining components
   3.   rebuild of engine
   4.   reinstallation of ancillary components and re-mating and
            reinstallation of engine/tranny
   5.   testing

This first section has been reviewed by Stan (thanks Stan) as I didn't
want to post mistakes, however in hindsight I don't think that was
an efficient use of Stan's time, the rest can be corrected (flamed)
by the group.  Sorry if this is too long, several people asked for
the notes so I'm just posting to the whole group.

Items are presented in what I believe would be the best order given my
hindsight, not necessarily the order I completed them.  READ THE BOOKS
BEFORE YOU START.  DON'T BLAME ME IF YOUR CAR ISN'T THE SAME.  MY CAR

             tether lower ends 1'-2' apart.  Prop rear desk open with
             this triangle.  Lash compressor to this support so compressor
             is clear of engine.
    D.  Underneath car, RHS
        1.   Drain oil tank and engine oil
        2.   Chock both front wheels, jack the car at both sides so the
             wheels are several inches from the floor (need reasonable
             room to move underneath).
        3.   Remove the wheels
        5.   Unbolt the axles from the transmission, use a breaker bar
             to turn the wheel to give access to each of six bolts on tranny
        6.   Repeat this procedure on the wheel end of the axle
        7.   Unbolt ground strap from firewall and front end of tranny case

        2.   Pop-off throttle linkage ball joint
        3.   Repeat steps 5 and 6 from D to remove LHS axle
        4.   Repeat step 8 from D to remove torsion bar
II.  Remove engine and transmission
        1.   Loosen the two front mounting bolts at the front of the
             transmission case.   DO NOT REMOVE THESE COMPLETELY.  Do
             not back out the bolts more than a few turns, this is only
             so you can easily remove them later when in an uncomfortable
             position.
        2.   Position your dolly under the car (the one I made was not
             really suitable, but now I know what they should be like.
             I will post plans when I make it up for re-installation).
        3.   With the wheels still off, using two floor jacks at the
             jacking points, lower the car till the engine and transmission
             rest on the dolly, be careful not to rest the car on the rear
             brake rotors or shields.  You will need two people to manage
             the jacks for this and the next couple of steps.
        4.   Make sure the dolly is correctly positioned under the engine
             and transmission.
        5.   Reach under and remove the front two mounting bolts
        6.   Remove the two mounting bolts at the rear
        7.   Jack the car up an inch (1") and make sure that
             everything is properly disconnected.
        8.   Pull the engine back a few inches (1-2") to get the shift
             linkage free of the car body.
        9.   Continue to jack up the car carefully.  Use two jacks at the
             same time to raise the car.  With a dolly height of about
             6 inches I needed about 36" of clearance measured from the
             top of the bumper to the floor.
        10.  Withdraw the engine and transmission assembly from the car.
III.   Engine and transmission de-mating
        1.   Make sure the engine and transmission are both supported
             at each end of their respective cases - there should be
             no cantilever force at the junction of the two cases.
        2.   Remove the starter motor
        3.   Put three axle bolts back into the drive pad at each side of
             the transmission
        4.   Wedge a breaker bar between the bolts and the floor on one
             side of the transmission to prevent it turning.
        5.   While looking through the starter motor appeture at the 
             flywheel, turn the remaining drive pad which should cause
             the flywheel to rotate.
        6.   There are three rivnut type thingies on the flywheel.  Screw
             a M6x12 cap screw into each of these in turn.  This will take
             up the tension on the TO bearing.  You will feel each screw
             tighten then bottom out, don't over tighten.
        7.   You should now be able to stick your finger in the hole on
             the other side of the transmission case and rotate the
             release bearing with your finger.  Shine an inspection light in
             and look at the bearing and release fork to see what
             you're spinning.
        8.   Underneath the transmission, remove the circlip and the
             clutch releasee lever from the post
        9.   Prise the auxiliary spring towards the front.  It will reach a
             dead spot and come off.  This frees up the release fork
             to rotate inside the bell housing
        10.  Unbolt the remaining three studs holding the transmission
             and engine together (the upper starter motor stud is the
             fourth retaining bolt).
        11.  Using a side to side and up and down wriggling motion
             (you will probably have to use a BIG screwdriver as
             a lever) pull the transmission and engine apart.
        12.  Stop several times and look in the tranny to make sure
             release fork is rotating (though if it isn't I don't
             know what you'd do).
IV.  Removal of ancillary components
     A.  Remove the "tub" of sheet metal the engine sits in
         1.   Start at the front right (above flywheel) and move clockwise
     B.  Remove the whole intake system
         1.   Undo all the intake manifolds at the head
         2.   Unbolt the plate the throttle linkage moves on
         3.   Remove the throttle linkage spring
         4.   Disconnect wiring plugs (and label wires) at #1 and #4 intake,
              at the rear of the two throttle bodies
         5.   Carefully lift and wiggle, the whole intake system should come
              off as one unit
     C.  Remove the remaining electronics
         1.   Unbolt and remove the ignition coil
         2.   Remove the sensor from the side of the distributor
         3.   Remove the distributor
         4.   Remove the remaining bolts from the red cover
         5.   Lift the red cover, you will see the fan/alternator is
              grounded to the case, unbolt this ground strap
         6.   Remove the red cover and wiring harness, the fan unit
              comes with the cover
         7.   Remove the fan strap
     D.  Remove the exhaust system
Where you break the exhaust system will be predicated by which bolts are
the newest/easiest to undo.  Since I have a new catalytic converter and
a new muffler here is what I did
         1.   Unbolt the catalytic converter from the LHS heat exchanger
              and from the cross over pipe from the RHS heat exchanger
         2.   Unscrew the straps that hold the muffled to the underneath
              the engine and remove the muffler and catalytic converter
              as one unit
         3.   Turn engine over
         4.   Remove LHS heat exchanger - you access the socket head nuts
              through holes in the heat exchangers
         5.   Disconnect remaining oil line at union now accessible
         6.   Remove adel clamp and oil line
         7.   Remove RHS heat exchanger and cross over pipe as one unit
         8.   Lower engine down on bench using two blocks under crank
              case fore and aft of (but not under) oil screen cover

My own experiences selling stuff in the UK indicates that once you
have included the VAT and the import duties, you can just about
make a profit if you take the US price in dollars and charge the
exact same number of pounds. Which does roughly double the price.
Presumably the same transfer function applies if the item originates
in Europe, but the new EU stuff was supposed to drop the import
duties wasn't it? Should drop the price a fair bit.

Over here, the advertised prices do not include local sales taxes
change of registration or licencing. To the point that the phrase
"not including tax, title, license" used in conjunction with anything
else is taken to mean that there may be significant details or costs
not currently being discussed.

Subject: Monthly Message from Fearless Leader

August 1994

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

We crossed the 800 member line for a few days earlier this month, but
seem to have stabilized a few below that for now. As a result, it's
getting more and more important to have some semblance of order.

Couple of major administrative items:

1) do not give out the main list address, *ONLY* give out the admin
   address. Since everyone seems to have trouble remembering that,
   it's "porchephiles-request@tta.com". I do encourage you to get
   your friends hooked up, if you think it's appropriate, once
   you have an idea what it's all about.

2) *PLEASE* use that address to be dropped, added, have your address
   changed, get on or off the digest version, or get your car listed
   in the Who's Who. *PLEASE* do not use the main address for those
   functions.

3) As you head out for extended vacations, you might consider unsubscribing
   and then re-subscribing as soon as you're back. It'll keep the load down
   at your end, and when your mailbox fills up and mail starts bouncing,
   I'll only drop you anyway.... This way, you at least know what's going
   on! BTW, you *MUST* ask to be re-added, rather than saying "put me back
   on after Aug. 14th" or whatever...

As I noted in a prior mailing, the FTP restriction applies to major 
downloading of stuff from the archives, not WWW access. Suggestions for
improving the WWW pages would be welcomed, as well as experienced help
in doing so.

COPYRIGHT AND FAIR USAGE STATEMENT

The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence by and between
members of a closed community. As such, the copyright for EVERYTHING that 
ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 18 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070..

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

914 exterior stuff & RWR AutoX
    I'm bummin'.  For the first time in my young racing career,
someone in my class has beaten me.  By 4/10 of a second.  Sniff.
We had a "Mini-Laguna" course, with 70-90+MPH on the straight-
away!  Fast course, but still about a minute per lap!
    Two questions:  How do I get the shoe polish marks off of my
tires?  I'm kinda tired of them, and I don't want any cop think-
ing that I've been parked too long in a limited-time lot...
    My fiberglass rear valence panel has stripped out on the
right side.  The panel is split at the hole on the end, with
very little of the horizontal part the mounting hole is drilled
through left.  Suggestions on repair?  I've been thinking that 
duct tape on the *inside* may give me a *very* short-term solu-
tion.
    Thanks!

Subject: How to re-attach seatback forward handle?

Sorry for the confusing 'subject' line, but couldn't think of another
way to put it.  

Anyways, the little plastic handle on the side of the passenger seat
popped off.  This is the handle you lift up to move the seat-back
forward.  The handle fits back on perfectly, but is not held in place.
It keeps falling off again.  Anyone know how to keep it in place?  I'm
thinking of using Crazy Glue...

Steve,

When my '87 951 was brand new, I took it directly from the dealer to Rich's
Car Tunes in Watertown, where they installed a stereo (the car came special
ordered without a factory sound system), and a top of line Alpine Alarm. At
the time I lived near Boston, so the alarm seemed like a good idea.

After about a year of return visits without success to stop the false
alarming, they finally got Alpine to replace the "brain" under warranty. By
this time, the model line had changed, so I actually got a better unit. The
falsing problem was reduced, but not stopped.

Final resolution: I determined by experimentation that if the car were left
in the sun with the dash heating up, there would be a little stress "pop"
which caused the microphone style glass break detector to trip the alarm.
Many other possible sources of sound could also result in the same effect.
Because the sensor was mounted in the dash, even lowering the sensitivity of
the mike didn't help, as the sound was directly transmitted through the mike
case.

Solution: 1) put the alarm in "scan mode" which requires two sensor trips
within 10 seconds of each other to trip the alarm. No more falsing. 2) I
moved to Vermont, where I don't worry much at all about auto theft (and the
air is better too!).

HTH,

Subject: 914 sidemarker lights

My brother-in-law has a 1970 or 1971 914 which he bought in Thailand (for
the privilege he had to dole out $20,000 since older cars could not be
legally imported) and I am trying to help in find the correct parts for it.

I have a feeling that the car is a European model because it sports a small
rectangular side light marking similar to a Euro 911. Can anyone confirm
this.  Dr.Johnson's book did not mention this feature.  The only thing he
said was that the Euro model did not have the letters "porsche" on the
engine grill.  This particular car has the ABS plastic rocker covers with
the Porsche logo, a plastic Porsche lens covering the space between the tail
lights, and aftermarket wheels.  The only identifying numbers I know of are
W 0046975 which I suspect is the engine number.

One of the small side marker lens is broken and he needs a replacement.  I
ordered the 911 Euro lens from Performance and hope it will fit.

Any info from here (the US) or abroad is appreciated.

PS. ratty 911's are sold in the $100,000 range.

Subject: Re: "Slapping" 924S Timing Belt Fixed!

First, thanks to all who responded to my request!

Yes, the balance belt and the timing belt were both VERY loose!!
The were belts made by Gates (FYI) and were less that 30K miles old.
They were retensioned 2000 miles after installation. (However I did
not do the work so I do not know how or how well it was done.)

As a safety measure, I replaced both belts, both idler rollers, and 
both adjuster gears(? well, they have teeth, pulleys maybe?)  The only
real trick was realizing that the ENTIRE tension adjuster for the cam
belt comes out as one piece (three nuts to remove) and after that it
was a piece of cake to remove the cam belt.

Although I was cautioned to mark all the driven pullys with white paint
so that they could go back together at the right rotational positions, I
found that all four that count (crank, cam, and two balance shafts) have 
factory index marks to cover that area.

Reassembly went well with one exception.  I was not sure how to position
the idler for the balance belt properly.  It has a slotted, off-center hole
that allows for about 1/2 inch adjustment in ANY direction!  I did note the
position of the original (not quite touching the belt at either of the two
places it could, if adjusted to do so.) It seemed odd to me to have an idler 
which did not touch the belt at all, but remembering who last adjusted it,
I guess anything is possible.

I adjusted it to slightly offset the belt as it runs ABOVE the idler from
adjuster to driver's side balance shaft. This should minimize the motion
in the longest run of the belt. 

If anyone knows the "correct" way to adjust this idler I would appreciate 
that information.

Running fine now with new rollers and Pirelli belts from Zim's.

Subject: Headliner on Targa Top - best adhesive

It`s summer the weather is nice and thus due to excesive targa top usage
the headliner on my targa top is starting to sag a little.  It looks 
to me like I can undo the screws holding the trim pieces on and I 
should then be able to re-glue the headliner back up so that it does not
sag.

Are there any gotchas to doing this ?  

Is there a better way ?  

I was intending to use plain old rubber cement, but have heard mention
of the 3M adhesives here on the list.  Will the rubber cement work well
or would it be better for me to go find the 3M style adhesives ?  What
do you guys think ?


Thanks for any help you can provide,

Subject: Color Revelations

	The color of my '84 Carrera, as defined by the
tag on the passenger's side of the trunk, is "hellbronze
metallic".  Is this the original German, or has it been
translated?  If it is in German, what would the English
equivalent be?

	Regardless, it is a very pretty color, with a
rather, er, devilish appeal to it...

Subject: Engine fan update for '78 911 SC

I've been fighting a 'hot' SC engine at the track this year.  Not hot 
as in fast, but as in 300 degrees of oil temperature.  I had a Carerra 
oil  cooler installed last week to replace the loop cooler, and saw a 
30+ degree difference when running hard at the track on Saturday.  
However, 255 is still too hot in my mind, and I've been asking others 
in my local PCA region about possible changes that would help keep 
things cool.  I've already removed the A/C pump and rear condenser.  
I'm also going to replace the cat converter with a test pipe.

One modification that I hadn't heard of  before involves updating the 
fan blade and housing to the version used in '80 and later.  Apparently 
the '80 fan has longer blades and a thinner fan housing, resulting in 
better airflow over the engine.  One club member thought it was as 
simple as a new fan and housing, without any changes to the alternator. 
 Anyone have experience with this modification?

Any other suggestions?  Anyone tried to do the equivalent of a cool 
brake kit to bring more air to the cooler?

Subject: FW: 911 brake bias adjuster


I have late model Carrera brakes on my flared 74 911, and even with 
225's in the rear, I am getting some rear wheel lockup on hard braking. 
I know the Carreras had a proportioning valve for this reason, but I 
was curious if anyone has used or knows of an adjustable brake bias 
valve, preferably one that is driver adjustable. I have heard of some 
which, instead of a dial, have 5 clicks of adjustment, which seems nice 
and repeatable, but I don't know any more than that. Thanks for any info!

  OFFICE MEMO         912 vibration and color               Date:  8/1/94
Our 1968 912 has a steering wheel vibration that increases in amplitude with
speed.  At city speeds it is hardly noticeable, but at highway speeds, it
becomes annoying.  I have had the wheels balanced and the front end aligned,
but the problem persists.  Could this be something loose in the linkage?  Is
this normal for this age of car?  Any suggestions to diagnois?
Also the car has been painted several times, does anyone know the original
color of 1968 912s,  whatever "red"  was being used at the time.
Thanks for any help.

I don't remember where I saw it, but I believe that the unused fuse is
for the optional rear window defogger (I'm not sure I have ever seen
a 914 with the option). However, there is another fuse issue which all
914 owners should be aware of. Porsche, in their infinite wisdom,
ran both the fresh air blower in the engine compartment and the fuel
pump control circuits from the same fuse (I don't remember if the fuel
pump itself also uses the same fuse, or just the relays, but it
doesn't matter). If the fresh air blower draws too much current, for
any of a variety of reasons, and blows the fuse, the car stops.
Put that on your list of things to check when the car just stops
out on the road somewhere, especially if you just pulled up on the
red handle. Also, don't just look at the fuse. On one occasion I
had a good fuse, but it had gotten hot enough from being run
(presumably) very near its maximum rating that the phosphor bronze
spring tabs had gotten hot and released the tension on the ends of
the fuse, so they didn't make good contact. If you find that condition,
remove the fuse, bend the tabs to re-create some preload, clean the
contacts and the fuse if you can, and put the fuse back.

On several occasions I thought about using the spare fuse slot to
separate the fusing of the fan from that of the fuel pump circuits,
but I never got around to it (there's no reason to fix the leak in
the roof when its not raining, etc).

Subject: Strut identification/torsion bars

Hi 'philes,

I have a pair of 911S front struts...black...with the aluminum "S" calipers.
How can I find out what year they are?  I believe "black" struts are original 
"Boge", but looking at ads in magazines, some seem to infer that 72-74 are 
different than 75+, while some other ads say that 74+ are the same.  I just 
want to make sure that when I have to buy new shocks, I buy the right type.

Are tubular "gun-drilled" torsion bars really better than conventional solid 
bars?  Or is this more hype?  Are the splines on a 914/4 bar different than 
those on a 914/6?

Thanks,

Allan

I just learned that my injector seals could stand to be replaced.  It seems
that over the years they have "shrunk" somewhat to the extent that my
injectors are actually a little
loose.  The dreaded CIS "false air"?  Anyway, two questions :

1.  Are these straightforward to replace? and,
2.  Automotion lists these things (P/N 063.133.557) @ $.50
     each!!  This can't be!  Nothing is this cheap.  Are these the 
     seals I need?

Thanks,

|
|         I just test drove a 1983 Porsche 944, and I need some advice
| on the car since I have never owned or driven a 944 until today.
|
|         Here are the facts and my observations.
|
|                 * 1983 Porsche 944 (no turbo)
|                 * 37K original miles

Make *sure* that the odometer hasn't gone around which would mean
that this car could really have 137K miles.

|                 * Price: $6000 (he will not go down in price)
|
|             The paint and interior are in great shape(minor cracks in
| dash)
|
|         ITEMS OF CONCERN:
|
|         - Around 70 MPH the car develops a slight vibration in the
| steering wheel. The car still feels very stable and tracks well when
| this is occuring but the vibration is a little annoying. My guess is
| that it might be a wheel balance problem.
|
|           Does anyone know of wheel vibration being a problem in these
| Porsches?

My car (an '84 944) has a slight vibration at 60 mph.  The wheels where
statically balanced.  A dynamic balancing might cure it.  I also know my
car needs new A-arm bushings.  A vibration of this sort could also be
caused by loose wheel bearings or bad ball joints or tie rod ends.

|         - At idle the car picks up a vibration from the motor mount.
| The owner claims this is a weakness in the design, and new updated
| mounts are available.
|
|           Does anyone know how much parts would cost to replace the
| mounts?

I just purchased a new mm from Zims for $139 plus shipping.

| Final question: Does this car sound like a good deal?

Well, there were numerous and significant upgrades introduced
during the '85 model year (hence the refferal to 85-1/2 944s).  Besides
a new interior, there are pressure cast aluminum A-arms and trailing
arms which are stronger and lighter than the earlier pressed steel
ones.  These are significant if you intend to track the car.  I have
heard of the pressed steel a-arms failing during hard cornering
on a race track.  I have seen excellent condition '86 944s selling
for ~$7k, and have been considering upgrading myself.

I can give you the _non_ merits of attempting to buy an Escort.  2 for

them back at my expense and didn't care for their customer service.  You
would think that they would send an advance replacement if they sell 
you something and it doesn't work..  At least the second time?  Nope.
They said they would do it, but they would charge it to my credit card
until the first one was returned.  

My response..  If there's going to be a second detector charged to my

It's not the same company that it was when they manufactured the original

Subject: '72T vs. '73S

Had the opportunity to drive a '72T Coupe over the weekend and thought I would
share with you my experience in comparison to my '73S Targa.

First, I didn't really drive the '72 for very long.  Just a bit of city driving.
Couldn't open her up on the freeway.  But right away I noticed that the T was
much lighter in its steering effort than my S Targa.  The T felt like it was
lighter in weight as well.  I also noticed the chassis on the T was much
stiffer than my Targa.  I cant figure why the T felt lighter than my S, I
guess the Targas are heavier than the Coupes.  Mine also has A/C.  Because
the ride height on the S is at 26.5" and 25" on the T may have been the reason
why the T rode stiffer and didnt roll as much in the front.

I noticed a big difference in the shifter.  The '72's shifter felt "notchy",
not nearly as smooth as the '73's.  Of course there was a difference in acceleration, althought the T felt, as I thought it would, much quicker from 0 to 4k
rpms than the S.  Above 5k rpms I noticed the T started to run out of breath,
whereas with my S, well, lets just say there is that from 4k rpms to 7k rpms
you get pushed further and further into the back of your seat and the power
just keeps on building.  All in all, I think now that the T is the 911 to
own for city or around town driving.  The S is for the freeway.  As for the
Coupe vs. Targa, well, now I think I understand why the someone described the
Targa's handling as MUSHY.  Hopefully its mainly due to my ride height though.

I would like to hear about any similar experiences with these two cars or
Targas vs Coupes in general.

My 924S came with a Blaupunkt "premium" (dont know what this means)
cassettte stereo. 

Anyway, it seems to be confused about what motor speed to select. 

When you put a casette in, it will play it at what sounds like double
or triple speed. 

After hitting eject and reinserting, after 1-2 tries it usually figures
out on its own to play at the normal speed. 

I have tried playing with FF and FR. Hitting these returns the speaker to
radio and winds the tape. When they disengage, if the tape is then played
it may or may not play at the wrong speed.

Is there some control I need to push to reset the unit somehow when it gets
confused?

Was the tow eye SUPPOSED to come with the toolkit?  Like Lou, my 951
did not come with one.  Although I am the second owner of my car, I
have (until now?) believed that it came with everything it was
supposed to, including what appeared to be a full toolkit.  I have
always imagined that the main purpose of the toolkit (at least
traditionally) was to help deal with roadside emergencies.  Of all the
gadgets you might like to have when broken down, this device would
seem to rank pretty highly compared with several of the other tools that
did come in the kit.  When was the last time anyone needed to use the
kit's plug wrench along the side of the road?.

Also, since this thread started I have checked my Owner's Manual and
have been amazed to find no mention whatsoever of the tow eye, even
though the car obviously has the receptacle for one.  Although
Porsches are of course legendary for their endurance, you would think
that the proper method for towing the vehicle would be discussed
somewhere in the Owner's Manual, wouldn't you?  It is also interesting
to note that the exploded diagram of the spoiler assembly on page 63-4
of the 951 factory shop manual does call out the eye, but the
corresponding diagram on page 63-10 for USA models does not.  Could it
be that the tow eye was supplied with ROW models only?  Perhaps the
concours experts can lend a hand here.

This does *NOT* sound like a good idea. When the headliner droops, it's
usually because the foam backing is separating from the fabric, not that
the foam is seperating from the top...

> Is there a better way ?  

Headliner repair is one of those "kids, don't try this at home" deals.
Take it to a pro, that has some experience (and references) doing Targas.
Think of it as preserving your resale value if nothing else.

If you persist with this lunacy, there is a 3M spray adhesive that is
*MADE* for this job. See your local auto paint shop supply store, 
they'll have it. Unlike "Gorilla Snot" (3M #8001), it's not a number

Sadly the EU rules does not cover all duties on items, e.g. you could still 
be charged duties to cover enviroment problems, health problems etc. created

nominal, the real cost lay in the different duties that has to be paid. Not

Subject: 356 & WWW info

Howdy, 

The question about the 914/VW reference numbers set me off thinking about a 
list for the 356.

I know the Maestro (Harry Pellow) has a list in 'The Maestro's little spec. 
book', (I'm sure I almost got the title right?!) But I'm sure there are 
other parts out there.

I am very interested in any knowledge about the early Beetle Fuel cocks, 
these are about $25 in Germany and could save some Bucks (or kroner) for any 
356 owner with a leaking old cock ;-)

As we already have heard the King and link pins are true VW parts, even if 
the bearing is not entirely correct in the beetle link pin kit.(Steel vs Brass) 

What about the fuel sender, it seem pretty much alike, but I guess one has 
to adjust the lever arm.

Interior handles are almost identical to early beetles too, (whatch window 
crank color, late beetles have the black knob, early have the Ivory.)

The inside door handle is more tricky, Haven't seen any car with it, but the 
Ferrari 250GT has very alike and these are reproduced. 

The interior lights are installed in Various VW's. 

I'm curious about the rear wheel cylinders, these are so cheap in comparison 
to the front cylinders I'm sure they are installed in a VW too.

Lots'a other parts I guess, any information appreciated, I'll even make a 
list of them if more than two appears. :)



WEB info

I upgraded to the new alpha6 version of Mosaic for windows, it was rather 
straightforward. Read about it in NCSA home page, and do it, cause it's 
bloody fast in comparison with the old one. 
If you're running from a 16bit machine (not NT,Chicago or Daytona or ......) 
you need to get the new win32 version 1.15A too.

Subject: moose on the loose

It was Sunday and I was heading north for a 4 week vacation.
I was doing the legal 90 km/h when all of a sudden a moose
ran out on the road. Turned to the right...braked..impact...
the car spun 180 degrees still in my lane.

Thanks to great porsche brakes I managed to reduce the speed
significantly so the damage to my '82 911 SC was actually minimal.

These cars seems to be quite robust. The moose was killed but the
damage to the car was restriced to the bodywork above the LH rear
wheel and the trailing arm.

I was indeed lucky this time as I didn't get the moose up on the
hood and roof.

This accident has, therefore, made me to consider a roll bar.

My question to the net of wisdom is whether someone knows any
roll bars that does not need any major modifications to the car
(like dashboard etc). I appreciate any advice.

Thanks in advance and...be careful out there!

Subject: Re: Engine fan update for '78 911 SC

Hi Marc,

Sorry to hear about your hot engine.

I have no experience with the 911's but here is an idea I've been thinking 
about.

It might be a total miss, but it could also be a good (and cheap) idea.

As your heat exchangers absorb a lot of heat from the exhaust system it 
could be interesting to use these to transfer heat away. 
My idea is simply to put an Y-pipe somewhere between the passenger 
compartment and the heat exchanger. With a little valve in it you could 
choose either hot air to pass. comp. or out into the air.

To test out this could be easy just to hook off the connections to the 
pass.compartment and lead the hot air somewhere down and away.

I got the idea from water coolers and fan coolers. Sometimes if oil got too 
hot in my beetle I turned the heaters on, boy did I sweat but the oil got a 
little colder too! Same applies to water coolers, when the engine temp gets 
too high you can lower it some by opening the heater (more cooling).

If you choose to try out this, please let me know your findings.

cheers,

Subject: Re: 83 944 Problems

The shimmy with the 83 944 at around 60-70 mph is a fairly common problem
which can be fixed with alignment settings that favor the maximum caster of
the front end, and ensuring that your wheels and tires are PERFECTLY round
and PERFECTLY balanced.  This problem does not seem to exist with later
models, which use power steering.

The updated motor mount (running around $150 each - I would go ahead and
install both of them) will fix the problem of the steering wheel bouncing at
idle.  Count on a reasonable mechanic charging you about 2 hours of labor
for both.

$6000 is a bit high for this car, but it's your money...  I would not pay
more that $5000 for any 83 944, unless it had Limited Slip and Sport Seats
and the Sport Package.  I guess that I'm just cheap.

Also, should you buy this car, first thing you need to do is get the timing
and balance shaft belts replaced, to reset the countdown timer for the valve
bending exercise.

Subject: 928 Hatch Release


The release mechanism for the rear hatch on my '84 928S operates in a way
that seems irrational, and I would like to find out how it works on other
cars. There is a little motor mounted in the body, with a crank arm
attached to it, and a rod attached to the crank which moves the latch
in and out as the motor revolves. Now, if I pull up on the hatch release
button next to either the driver or passenger seat, the motor runs; when
I release the button, the motor stops. Period. If I were designing
this, there would be some sort of limit switch which would cause the
motor to cycle back to its latched position before stopping, but I don't
see any such mechanism. I have the shop manuals on fiche, but the
quality is such that it is really hard to sort out the wiring diagrams,
so I could be missing something there which would help explain how the
thing is supposed to work. As it is, you have to go through a trial
and error process to get the motor to stop in approximately the right
place so that the hatch will latch properly. I have3 been ignoring the
whole thing and just using the key, but it would be nice to get such a
simple thing to work right.

My request to other 928 owners/users/fixers is: does your hatch release
work like this? If not, what does it do, and (ideally) why does it do it?
Any advice will be gratefully received.

      Definitely don't apply undercoating on bare metal.
   1. Make sure the rust is gone, get off any scaling. This is finally where
       sandblasting (the chassis) works.
   2. I'd hit bare metal next with a phosphorous-based etch, that sells
       under the name "Rust Cure" or "Ospho" around here. "Metal Prep"
        may be akin, but doesn't seem as strong. Rinse well.
   3. I've fallen in love with PPG's DP-90 Zinc-oxide based epoxy primer.
       Its the only thing I use over bare metal now. Let it cure the 1/2 hour
       required before applying and put on plenty of coats. A touchup gun
       (they only cost $30) is great for applying this underneath the car.
   4. Now put on your undercoating. I don't have any good recommendations on
       how to get a really high-build with a lot of texture (the rubberized
       aerosol stuff goes on pretty thin, I'm sure it takes a real            
       undercoating gun to duplicate the factory finish).

       Probably body color under the car is not "correct" or necessarily
   attractive--try and reproduce whatever it looks like the factory did and
   you'll probably end up happiest. Galvanized primer supposedly doesn't
   work well with "some paints," I'm not sure which paints those are.
       There are probably other Rust Converters (I've used the brush-on
   Extend before and like it on severe rust) that work well, but for light
   rust and funky surfaces I'm very impressed with the DP-90's adhesion and
   holdout.

Subject: Re: 911 engine removal

Very nice piece - that's what this list is really for.

A few notes (I just did the clutch on my '73 911S):
  - the M6x12 cap screws to relieve the pressure plate pressure are BS...you 
    can skip that step entirely (at least on my '73, which has the same
    clutch and pressure plate as the SC).  Same with the rotating the bearing
    thing.
  - removing the engine/trans from the body (after disconnecting everything)
    may not be trivial.  In my case the AC bracket stuck out over the rear
    engine mount point of the body - you had to sort of tilt the whole
    engine/trans along the diagonal to get it to clear.  Next time it gets the
    Makita grinder treatment ;-).
  - Be damn careful when you remove the exhaust studs.  Don't brute force the
    nuts - you'll break the studs and be in a world of pain.  Use a back and
    forth technique - tighten, loosen, tighten, loosen, etc. Usually in the
    really difficult cases the stud _and_ the nut (who have become one) will
    all come out.  I used this technique on my car and didn't break a one ;-).
    Use anti-seize and new copper nuts and inhex nuts when you put it back
    together!  I also replaced most of the studs...
  - For the '73 and earlier cars (maybe the later cars too) where you can
    remove the rear license plate panel, the height you need to raise the car
    (with the wheels on) in order to slide the engine/trans out from underneath
    is about an inch less than a 4x4 placed under each rear wheel...a good
    thing to know for those who only have one nice jack.

Subject: ignition kill


Hello, fellow porschephiles!

I was wondering if anyone out there has installed an ignition kill system 
as an anti-theft device.  I am thinking of a relay that closes  
the starter circuit thus preventing a potential thief to run away with 
the car.  The relay would be closed/opened from a small switch hidden 
somewhere, say under the dash, and only you, the owner, will now it's 
location.  I imagine it would take a thief too long to figure out why the 
car doesn't start so eventually he would give up.  
This seems to be a simple idea, easy to implement, but maybe there are 
some pitfalls.
What does the net wisdom say about this?  Do you think it's a good idea 
or it's just plain stupid or impossible to implement.  
If I would implement this, what kind of current values am I looking at in 
the starter circuit (10-20A) so I can select the right relay?

Thanks,

Ted,

I have forgotten that you are the Porsche 911 "racing god".  I must
apologize for suggesting you did not know what you are talking about.
Since you are so wise and knowledgable, would you please explain to me
why the following seems to be true but is not:

1. I have yet to see anyone building a Porsche 911 race car, or someone
with a Porsche 911 of any type used for racing, not wish for more rubber
on the road.

2. I have never seen anyone install narrower tires on their car for any
race track.

3. The 911's I see on the track with more rubber, all other aspects of
the car being relatiively equal, always seem to be able to go around
the corners faster.

4. Autox cars with wider tires seem more nimble and go around the course
faster.

Also, what do you consider "sufficient traction" and what size tire
provides this?  Please include what race tracks on which you believe this
tire size provides "sufficient traction".

Ted,

I am very disappointed in your explanations. Let me counter point by
point.

1. Yes, I have heard of vintage racing and stock car racing.  But what
do they have to do with my observation?  Both have specific limits on
tire sizes. I am talking about Porsches here, not other forms of racing.
But since you brought it up, both CART and FIA chose to require NARROWER
tires to slow down the cars in their respective series. How do you
explain that?

2. Narrower than the rules allow is what I mean by "narrower". My '78
911SC came with 205/55R16 tires on the front and 225/50R16 tires on the
rear. Both of these are wider than the 195/50 tires you run. My question
is why do people always run the widest tires they can when, according to
you, they should not?

3. Laguna Seca, Lime Rock, Road Atlanta, Le Mans, Spa, etc.  The question
I am asking is what tracks would you want to run narrower than allowed
tires on?

4. Let me rephrase, Autox cars with wider tires are more nimble and go
around the course faster than cars with narrower tire, all other things
being equal.

Nobody I work with sells tires.....

Subject: SCCA Porsche Racing in Seattle

Greg Fordahl has presented to the SCCA a proposal to run a Porsche grid 
at SCCA events and all indications are that we will be able to run our 
first event on Oct 8-9 in Monroe. Future events would be at SIR and Bremerton.

This would work like the SCCA Vintage grid does today: the race would 
be for Porsches only, and we will work out a set of rules consistent 
with PCA racing, tho some classes may be combined. SCCA will sanction 
the event, handle insurance and cornerworkers, and scoring. Each 
participant would pay an entry fee (probably less than $100) to the 
SCCA. The Porsche race would run in conjunction with existing SCCA events.

Car preparation will be the same as PCA requires (roll hoop, fire 
extinguisher, window net, electrical cut-off, etc.), as would driving 
equipment (fire suit, Snell helmets, etc.).

We are working out a system for licensing drivers who don't yet have an 
SCCA regional racing license. Since most PCA members in the PNW don't 
have and SCCA license, drivers should apply to PCA for a PCA club 
racing provisional license, and then run in this year's event as an 
SCCA novice. Ruth Harte can send you the PCA Club racing packet: 
703/922-9300. She's on the East coast. Drivers who don't yet belong the 
the SCCA would have to become members ($45). You can join the SCCA by 
calling the national office 303/-694-SCCA. (But don't call them with 
any questions about this, since it is being handled by our local region.)

If the crossbar is used as the mounting device once can argue that it is
legal.  Why not mount the belts on the rear firewall?  You will have to
drill new holes for the submarine belt and perhaps the lap belts as well to
use the approved strength bolts. 914's are fun cars, but I doubt whether
they will become higly collectible in pristine original form. Of all
Porsches, it is the only one that owners could freely drill holes and bang
out fenders without raising hell with the spouse.  So haul out your drill
and drill away!  No flames please on this subject.

I have seen many 914 drivers take out the seat cushion for added support and
lower center of gravity.  Is this legal in stock class? I run street
prepared and am able to cut off 1 1/2 inch of foam from the cushion and
removed the foam padding from the back. My seat is still padded and fully
upholstered and therefore legal.

Appreciate the feedback I got on the previous post.  Hopefully I'll post
the reassembly portion soon - I driving around with my hair on fire !

I.   Chain boxes
     A.  Left hand chain box (assumes mechanical tensioner)
         1.   Remove the oil line going to the cam oiler
         2.   Remove the front of the chain cover
         3.   Undo the little damper bolt in the side of the tensioner
         4.   Now you can compress the tensioner a little, pull the
              tensioner out from under the idler arm and pulley
         5.   Pull out the idler arm and pulley
         6.   Holding the chain taut so it doesn't slip and the cam doesn't
              rotate, remove the bolt holding the cam sprocket and
              remove the sprocket
         8.   Remove the timing "gear" from the end of the cam
         9.   Pry out and the woodruff key from the end of the cam
         10.  Remove the three bolts and seal from around the cam
         11.  Unbolt the chain housing
         12.  Slide the bottom of the chain housing off the studs as far
              as it will go, then pull the outside edge towards you.
              This will enable you to clear the end of the cam and remove
              the chain housing
         13.  Once the chain housing is off it is much easier to remove
              the slippers that are inside it (don't plan on reusing them)
         14.  LOOSEN the 4 bolts that retain the chain slippers inside the
              left half of the crank case
         15.  Holding the slippers inside the case with one hand, remove
              the bolts then pull out the slippers (don't drop these
              inside the case!)
     B.  Left hand chain box
         1.   Repeat steps 1-15 above.

II.  Oil cooler
         1.  Remove the two top and to lower bolts holding the oil cooler
             to the engine
         2.  Pull up and out on the oil cooler - be prepared to catch any oil

III. Cam housing and cylinder heads
     A.  Valve Covers
         1.   Remove the intake and exhaust valve covers
     B.  Cam housing
         1.  Remove the 5mm socket head bolt through each bushing
             holding the 8mm socket nut on the other end still
         2.  Make sure the rocker is loose, either the valve must be closed,
             or adjust the valve adjustment all the way out, or rotate the
             cam so the valve closes.
         3.  Drive out the bushing with a drift, mark each bushing and
             rocker with it's number and intake or exhaust
         4.  Slide out the camshaft.
         5.  With all the rockers out you can get to the cam housing nuts,
             remove all of these slowly and evenly.
         6.  Remove the cam housing, you will need to TAP it slightly with
             a rubber mallet.  Make sure it comes off evenly.
     C.  Cylinder Heads
         1.  Mark all the cylinder heads with their number
         2.  Mark all the cyulinder barrels with their number on the top side
         Follow these 3 steps for each cylinder
         3.  Loosen the cylinder head nuts evenly around a cylinder head.
         4.  Remove all the nuts
         5.  Carfully slide off the cylinder head
         6.  Slide off each barrel (after all the heads on that side removed)
             carefully, don't cock the piston over getting it out or
             you could break a ring.
     D.  Pistons
         1.  Remove the circlip holding the wrist pin by prying it out of
             it's groove with a small screwdriver
         2.  Support the back side of the con rod and carefully drive out
             the wrist pin (it's doesn't need to come out all the way
             just enough to get the piston off the rod)
         3.  Remove the piston
         4.  Pistons, pins, barrels and heads MUST be kept as a set.
     E.  Valves
         1.  Compress valve spring and remove the collets
         2.  Remove the valve springs, cap and seats, keep all these
             together and numbered with the rest of the cyl.
         3.  You can do a CRUDE valve guide check by the following two:
             Put your finger over the end of the seal and withdraw the
             valve - you should be able to pull a good vacuum.  With the
             valve out a little way, try moving sideways in the guide,
             you should have no more than an imperctable rocking.

Subject: 993 cabriolet roll-over protection? 


Hi everyone,

what happens if one is to have an unfortunate 
mishap and roll-over with a 993 cabriolet?

Is one a cooked duck? Is there any chance of surviving
the crash? BMW and Mercedes offer 
a standard roll-over bar that pops out.

Do Porsche engineers recommend crossing our fingers
and wishing very hard that a roll-over would never occur?
If so, it should definitely be specified in the owner's manual.

I visited the factory last year and found the same situation that
others have described.  The museum is open to the public without a
reservation, but you need to make a reservation at least a few weeks
ahead of time to be assured that you can take the factory tour.

Here's the address and phone number of the museum.  They should be
able to give you the correct number and address for reserving a spot
on the factory tour.

This will be close enough for you to take it to your mechanic for
proper tensioning. Leave the cover off.

You need the Porsche Special Tool #9207. It's a curved .5mm feeler
gauge basically. Adjust the distance between the idler and the belt
where the belt runs between the lower balance shaft and the idler
using the feeler gauge. I found this to be a royal pain to do with
the feeler gauge I had. But I got close enough so the belt didn't
slap and I could run it down to my mechanic for tensioning with
the infamous #9201 $500+ tensioning gauge.

I think that if it were the rev limiter, the engine would continue

Subject: Broken Door Handle


As anticipated the $%$##%&*$%@! plastic door handle on the driver's side 
broke (and the passenger sides probably not far behind).  Such a stupid, 
cheap thing on an otherwise solidly engineered and manufactured vehicle.  
I hope they fired the SOB who designed these flaws.  Anyway, enough 
ranting . . .

Stoddards has the replacement (plastic) handles for $8 (cheapest I've 
found).  Anyone know of anyone who carries the metal replacements for 
something less than Performance Products $80 a pair?  (NOTE to 
Performance Products: I can replace the plastic ones 10 TIMES for the 
price of one pair!)

Second, and more important . . . how does one go about removing the old 
handle and putting in the new one?  (These are the black plastic pull 
handles which activate the door release)  I can get the pull out of the 
little plastic clip, but how do you get the handle off the "hinge"?

Any help most appreciated.

Subject: Targa Top - Part II (longish)

I got the MIG welder out tonight to try to weld the two pieces back
together.  A word of advice to those who might have this problem in
the future: DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!  As I mentioned in my previous post,
I didn't know the exact metallurical makeup of the metal, but it now
appears to be some aluminum/magnesium alloy or something allong those
lines.  I won't even pretend to know.  My point is, while it was easy to
strike and arc, this stuff burned and splattered like you would not 
believe!  It made a mess.  One it melted it just would pool up, it just
went haywire like a jar of mercury or something, forming little balls of
hot metal all over the place.  When I blew on one trying to cool it off,
it glowed up a horrendous, brillant white, telling me that it might be 
magnesium.  I tried all head settings on the welder, and finally (probably
wisely) gave up.  

My solution was to take a 1/8" thick by 1 1/2" wide by 3" long piece of
galvanized steel and bolted it on the underside (headliner side) across the
gap.  I followed up with anothe pice the exact same size on the front
side (windshield side) following the curve of the frame.  Tomorrow when 
I get home from work I will weld the edges of the two pieces together.
So far the top works flawlessly, although it is about 1/8" high on the
broken side.

Maybe some of you are wondering what happened to the top in the first 
place?  Well, about 3 years ago, I was on a data with this girl, and
of course I had to take the top off to show what a big Porsche stud I
was, blah blah blah.  When I left her house (the next morning) I put 
the top back on so I wouldn't freeze my ** off, and in the distraction
of saying goodbye, etc, I forgot to latch it.  I got the the point 
where I was about to shift into 3rd, and I'm hearing a lot of wind noise,
and I'm thinkin', "hmm, the door must be open", and I looked, and it
wasn't; but just then I looked up and saw a  4" gap between the top 
and the windshield, and before I could slow down... WHOOSH!  It was gone.
I went back and picked it up - luckily nobody was around to run over it,
and it was a little scratched up, but no obvious damage.  

I guess it had cracked, and slowly the stress of putting it on and off 
over the next few years finally broke it.  One day, I drove in the 
garage and heard a weire "pop" from the top, and took the top off
and it fell apart on me...

Moral?  Pay attention to you TOP, and not your gonads!

Sorry for the bandwidth, but I figured it was a good story, with a
message...

Yes, this is a frequently heard complaint.  Some things to check and
try are:

1) Tightness and good condition of *all* front end components.

2) Try to find out if the original tie rod ends were upgraded to
the newer type (part number 944.347.033.01) that was supposed to fix
this problem on the '83s.

3) Have the wheels balanced on the car (better tire and race shops can
do this).

4) Increase the toe-in to somewhere around 0.1 in.

The upgraded mounts (make sure you get part number 951.375.042.04) are
available for $119 each from Vertex in Florida ((305) 442-2727).  I
believe that this is the best price you will find anywhere.  The metric
bolts you will need are not provided with the mount, by the way.
Replace both mounts if they are not the upgraded model.

Good luck,

There is a little metal clip (part number 311.881.247) that you have
to insert in the knob before pressing it in place.  Assuming the knob

One of the reasons I will not ride in a convertible or cabriolet is that I
have survived an accident in which the car rolled over.

Although the A-pillar (the pillar between the Windshield and the Front Door)
is very strong on any Porsche, the standard policy for track events here in
the PCA is to require rollbars on any cars without roofs.  Targa and 914
structures are deemed to be sufficient rollover protection.

In my opinion, convertibles are just marginally safer than motorcycles. 
Maybe I'm just getting more aware of my mortality as I get older.

Subject: Re:  928 Interior door panel removal

Matt, I went out over lunch today and took a look at the trunk opening
system for my '86 928S. I've got no data to indicate if the '84 is 
same or different. In general, pulling up on the trunk release knob 
(either driver's or passenger's) activates the motor through a 
2-second "cycle" which result in the trunk motor starting, releasing
the latch, and stopping. If I hold the knob "on" (pull up constantly),
the motor runs constantly, but once I let go the motor stops as soon
as the trunk is unlatched.

The switches, by the way, are spring-loaded pull-upwards type; just 
a momentary pull and release, the switch springs back to the off 
(down) position, the trunk unlocks, and the motor stops. Both 
switches function identically, and neither switch will work if either
door is open.

I don't have my wiring diagrams here at the office so I can't say 
exactly how it's wired. Pretty obvious that there is some kind of 
cycle switch which stops the motor at a certain point of travel. 
I'll check tonight and see if there's any additional info in my
documentation.

Best,

It's just my HO, but I believe that Porsche engineers recommend keeping the 
rubber-side down.  If they don't, I certainly do.  ;-)

It's pretty hard to tip a Porsche, but sh*t happens, so I suppose it can
be done if you try hard enough...

A few years ago (11/5/66) when I was a bit less wise and more intemperate, I 
unwisely went out on an all-night beer-drinking, skirt-chasing safari with 
a young Luftwaffe Feldwebel who was temporarily stationed at Fort Sill, 
Oklahoma.  

Unwisely, we took my '66 Corvette.  Unwisely, I let him drive when we returned 
to the Fort at 0500.  Unwisely, I slept while he drove.  Unwisely, he ran a 
red-light.  Unfortunately, a policeman observed this and started to pursue 
with lights flashing.  *Very* unwisely, the driver decided to take the on-ramp 
to the Turnpike to Oklahoma city and try to out-run the cop.  

I awakened when the car violently slewed out of control and launched itself 
into space as a speed the Oklahoma Highway Patrol report estimated to be in 
excess of 145 mph.  My eyes *popped* open to see nothing but brown, dead grass 
in the headlights, from what looked to be about 3 meters up in the air.  

The next thing I saw was a Nurse, 3 days later in the  Intensive Care Unit 
at the Ft. Sill Army Hospital, where they brought me.  I was brought-into the 
Hospital listed *Dead-on-Arrival* and left on the gurney for the 4 plus hours 
that they worked on the driver.  By the time they were done with him, they had 
typed a name tag for me and placed it in the holder on a drawer in the morgue.

The car, according to the OHP, cleared an AARMCO steel guard-rail, went some 
254' thru the air, landed on the nose, and went end-over-end for more than 
600'; coming to rest right-side up (*rubber-side down*, if you will).

Yeah, there's always a chance...  ;-)

Why not KILL 2 birds at one time,  car theft and car jacking.

Find a key spot in the electrical system and install a series slowblow fuse
and locate a switch that bypasses it.    Play with the fuse size to allow it 
to run for 30 sec or so and blow (nice safe distance).

The thinking is if it won't start, the logical thought is a cutoff (fuel, 
elec, etc.) the challange is put out, then the search is on to find a 
switch.   If it runs for a bit, hopefull thought is POS (piece of ....).

One wonders in these situations what else you could have done. The horn
might have scared it, but if the car didnt why should the horn? I've
seen ultrasonic whistles you can attach to your car that scare away 
animals, but I'm not sure I appreciate this tactic (e.g. would you 
appreciate this tactic in your hearing range, to keep you off the road?).

Personally, birds bother me sometimes. I wonder what the effect of a bird
coming through my winshield at 60-70mph would be. Of course, the airfoil
would partially deflect it, but probably not enough. Bugs are much lighter
and they occaisonally go splat.

Saturn had an ad where a couple claims that a wild burrow kicked their
car, putting a big dent in the door. The dent popped itself right back 
out (plastic body panels). There was only paint damage. 

Maybe we need some plastic bodies for Porsche. Maybe we could drive them
on bright orange plastic roads too.

- ----- Begin Included Message -----

Very nice piece - that's what this list is really for.

A few notes (I just did the clutch on my '73 911S):
  - the M6x12 cap screws to relieve the pressure plate pressure are BS...you 
    can skip that step entirely (at least on my '73, which has the same
    clutch and pressure plate as the SC).  Same with the rotating the bearing
    thing.

I got F*cked on this by the Haynes manual.  After 2 hours I finally
said screw it and undid the adjusting nut. Then I removbed the cuirclip
and lever arm (something else the manual never mentioned!
 THANX HAYNES!

  - removing the engine/trans from the body (after disconnecting everything)
    may not be trivial.  In my case the AC bracket stuck out over the rear
    engine mount point of the body - you had to sort of tilt the whole
    engine/trans along the diagonal to get it to clear.  Next time it gets the
    Makita grinder treatment ;-).

I found that removing the rear valanace and pputting the rear tires on
2 6" cinder blocks gabe me adequate clearance for an SC with webbers.
The moto/trans was sitting on a single HD garage jack so it was only
about 3 1/2 " off the ground.  I also use a 2x8 with 2x4s screwed
across it to ccreate a saddle for the front tires.  Thi sensure s that
the car won't take a hike on me.

I also had the extreem pleasure of removing the assy with the left axle
attached to the motor.  This involved removing the outer CV before it
would clear the teailing arm.  FUN FUN FUN!

Subject: Cool Carbon reinstallation problem

Hello p-philers, I am in need of some advice:

I just put Cool Carbons back on my '87 951 for the second time, adding the
backing plates recently obtained from VCI.  I also removed the rotor shields
from around the rear rotors while I was at it.

Since I did this, I now experience a distinct whine (more like a moan or rubbing
sound) during very hard braking, expecially after the car warms up.  It almost
sounds like a tire is hitting the wheel well, but I am experiencing no pull to
either side.

Things I have already checked out:
    - Inspected the pads, backing plates, sensors, retaining clips (all fine)
    - Insured lug nuts are tight
    - Checked tire pressure (40 front, 35 rear)
    - Inspected tires for abnormal wear from rubbing (none found)
    - Inspected front wheel bearings, which are in need of repacking/tightening

Things I might have screwed up:
    - Removed rear rotor shields WITHOUT removing rotors.  I recall from an     
      earlier posting that it was recommended to do this, but I was able to
      remove three screws and take the shield off by twisting it a bit. One
      of the screws had to be reinstalled, as it held a brake pad sensor
      component in place.  Anything abnormal here?

    - Depressed caliper piston incorrectly, possibly causing damage?  I pushed  
      each piston in individually by using leverage against the other side of   
      the caliper.  Anything wrong with that?
   
    - Left brake fluid reservoir cap on during the entire process.  I still have
      a hard pedal, after the intial pumping back up that was necessary.

Any and all thoughts/flames appreciated.

An old, but simple and effective technique, is to run a wire from
the points through a switch, to ground (the chassis).  When grounded
the car won't start.  I've done it on many cars with never a problem.

I suppose a good thief could figure it out, but it would probably
take him longer than he'd be willing to spend.  A really professional
thief is going to pick your car up with a tow truck, so he won't
car what kind of gizmos you've got.  I don't think there is any real
protection against a determined professional.  Switches and most
alarms deter amateurs and joyriders.

I thought the 'proper' way was to heat the pistons a bit to make
the pin slide out easier.  I used a heavy duty hair dryer, and was
able to push most of the pins out with finger pressure.  For inserting
them, I heated the pistons the same way, and also cooled the pins

    A couple of suggestions on the hands thing:
1)  Costco (etc.) sells latex "examination gloves" for about $10 for 
200 pairs.  These are very nice for keeping your hands (but not your 
arms, too bad) fairly clean.  They don't detract much from your "feel"
and they're decently strong.  Of course, they like to "grab" onto
twisting things (like my factory jack handle) and oil will make them
deteriorate, but they're cheap.  (Suggested by "Wild" Bill Newton.)
2)  (Suggested by Soren)  A toothbrush with the bristles cut down to
about 1/3 original size is *great* for getting stubborn dirt off your
hands and out from under your fingernails.

Subject: Tom's Undercoating



Tom-

Lee has given you really good advice.  PPG's DP-90, or DP-40, the
difference is their color, is considered by many to be the best bare 
metal primer.  It sticks to anything. Like Lee, I wouldn't use anything 
else on bare metal.

I'm not a big fan of undercoating.  I just don't think
it really does anything for you.  And if it gets on nuts and bolts
and stuff like that, it's a royal pain to clean it off when
you have to remove them.  I'm sure it's true that a good, flexible 
undercoating will help reduce nicks from flying stones, and if I were 
doing an off-road 4x4 I'd consider it, but for a pampered Porsche, I 
don't know if it's worth it.  To me it's almost in the category of those 
rustproofing jobs you used to be able to purchase when you bought a 
new car.  Maybe you still can.  If you drive in the rustbelt, your car 
rusts whether rust-proofed or not, unless you keep it real clean, and 
then the rustproofing doesn't matter anyway.

A good primer like DP-40 or 90, and a good coat of paint, works well.  
Then just keep the underside  clean by hosing it down every now and 
then.  However, if you do use undercoating, go for something like 
Body Shutz, made by 3M I think and available at any auto paint store, 
and use the gun that is sold for that purpose. It goes on well, gives a 
thick build and looks good.  The aerosol cans of undercoating don't 
do much more than a coat of black Krylon would do.  They give 
everything a nice clean appearance.  That's about it.

One more thing.  My experience with rust converters, like Ospho,
which are really just phosphoric acid, is that for heavy rust, which 
means rust you can see, they make it look like the rust is gone -they 
turn the surface layer from brownish-red to black - but underneath 
the rust is still there and will eventually come through.  You really 
have to grind it all away.  Then use Ospho or Metal Prep to make 
sure there aren't a few remaining micro rust pits, and to etch the 
entire surface of the metal as a base for the primer.  And don't wait 
too long after wiping on the Metal Prep before primering.  New rust 
starts on bare metal very quickly.  I personally like Metal Prep 
because it seems to leave the surface cleaner than Ospho, but in the 
end they're probably both the same.  Metal Prep is marketed 
specifically for automobiles, Ospho is marketed as an industrial 
material.

Whattaya mean you've never seen the rear window defroster option on a 914.
My '74 1.8L not only has the rear window defroster but also the engine
block heater.  You know the kind you plug into 120v to warm the oil up
enough to start the engine after a really cold winters night.

Yup, it looks like my 914 saw plenty of winters before I got it.  Its

Does this mean that you replaced the CIS system with Webber carbs ?
Is this a street machine (or would it suitable for the street) ?
The reason I ask is Bruce Anderson claims 30 hp increase with a

Hi all:

I am hoping that one of the SCCA Solo II guru's and/or Porschephiles will
offer up some advice on this one.  (By the way,  is there a way to directly
contact SCCA SEB officials via email?)

I am currently running a 74 914 1.8L in DS for SCCA and P4 for PCA events in
the Houston Region.  It is a great, but ugly, little car that I have lots of
fun in. Even do well sometimes. But, I am always going to extreme lengths to
'sit tight' in my seat.  You know, twist the belt etc..  I even use a Dick
Turner velcro chest harness.  It looks pretty stupid, but it helps a bunch.

I now have the opportunity to buy a five point harness and the harness bar
to install it on.  There lies my question.  I have seen these bars, they are
mounted on the interior by bolting it to the frame behind the seats, on many
different cars - specifically 914's, Miata and Fieros.  It is not a cage or
even a roll bar.  Is this legal in DS????  The 94 SCCA Solo II rule book
seems to be very vague on the subject.  (It is specific on cages and bars
though.)  It seems to imply that it is ok in a closed car - my 914 with the
roof on - but not OK in open cars.  Am I missing the boat or what is the
deal here?  All opinions would be much appreciated.  (BTW - I know that I
must leave the standard belt in place.)

I am trying to make a decision today so thanks in advance for any help.

rusty.

Subject:  914 Gearbox Suggestions Requested

At the PCA Ohio Valley Region IRAC Autocross last Sunday, my 914-6
(1973 car - conversion to 2.7 S engine) lost 1st gear on the original
gearbox. Nothing dramatic - after the 2nd run, did the usual shot out of
the box, rev to the top in each gear, and when done - no 1st gear! I'm
checking with local friends for a good used box (whole), but wonder if:
1) Best place to buy just the 1st gear (it IS NOT a cheap gear) and 2) has
anyone done a conversion to the 915 gearbox in a 914? It'll work fine
with the motor, but what about shaft alignment, length in the car, linkage
problems. Would it even be worth considering? Any suggestions from
those who've done it?

Subject: Referral for Moving Porsche La->Atlanta

Local places give a quote of $800 or so for moving my 924S from Los Angeles
to Atlanta. This is in an uncovered car carrier. Now I realize that once
I give my car to some of these people, no telling what might happen to it.

For instance, I once saw a car carrier taking new minivans (they had
stickers). I don't remember what brand. Anyway, minivans being a bit
bigger, I guess they wanted to make quota anyway. One of the minivans
was being towed with the front wheels on the carrier and the rear on the
freeway. Wouldn't you like to buy this one?

At the very least, I envision some idiot repeatedly trying to push down
the drivers door lock and slamming the door. Eventually, he'd just leave it
unlocked. Guess I need to make a sign.

I'd like to pay $800-1000 of my future employers money. I get $2K to move
which must be spent on moving, and dont have much else besides me. 

I know I can drive it in 3 days, or maybe 20 hours if I got lucky :-) 
I'd rather not this time.

Covered car carriers wanted $1400 , too much I think. 

Anyway, referrals or complaints would be most appreciated.

'83 944 for $6K - Gotta agree with George. That's high, and you can find an
'85.5 for that much. Which would have much more modern
interior/heating/AC/suspension etc. Of course, 37K miles is very low, but on
well-maintained higher mileage cars you will often find that components have
worn-out and been replaced, saving you the trouble. FYI - My '861 951 with 75K
miles cost me $7.5K. It needed a manifold (cracked) and had the wiggle at 70mph.
An alignment and wheel balancing took care of that. Also look for bent wheels. I
was/am in the process of geting a beater to replace my '79 and '83 RX-7's and
have looked at late 80's Supra Turbos and RX-7 Turbos. Unfortunately, I have yet
to find such a car that beats the 951 in terms of condition and mileage for less
$. This is leading me to using the 951 as the daily driver, while I look for a
better car for a weekly waxer.

Someone in Maine looking for an SC Targa - My search lead me to a cheap '85
Targa Carrera. It proved unsuitable for me because I wanted a newer car. It has
94k miles, some decent bodywork, scratched 17" Ruf wheels (8 &9's) w/ D40's, a
Ruf front spoiler, whale tail, wear on the seats, remote alarm, aftermarket
stereo, loss of anodization on the Targa bar, sagging Targa headliner, sagging
engine mat, minor idle twitch, etc. It basically looked like an average 100K
mile car. The engine seemed strong and no bizzare noises were heard during the
test drive. The price tag on the car was $16K at Auto Sport Design, Mineola,
Long Island, New York 516-248-0066 and includes a major service. It's a
consignment and probably as negotiable as the owner wants to be. I just had no
interest in a car that costs twice as much as my 951, and whose condition was
inferior to my beater. It seemed good for a "fix while driving" sort of owner. I
have no relationship with the car or owner. I do my service at that shop though.
Definitely one of the lower prices I have seen on a Carrera with service
history.

SC vs. Carrera - Narrower tires="better" handling. Well not exactly, but I can
imagine 2 scenarios. First a very tight twisty auto-x course can reward a car
with a narrower track. This is because it will give you more room to modify your
line without hitting a cone. Narrower car & narrower tires=narrower track.
Second, when it's wet out, a narrower tire will have a smaller contact patch
supporting the same weight with less tendency to hydroplane.

Based on my very, very, very limited experience with the 3.2 911, I feel that it
doesn't offer more performance than a 951. I think that it is worth it to save
for a 930 if one really wants more punch. Does anyone disagree? I'm just
standing in here without a Nomex suit waiting for the flames.

Ted,

1. How is it contrary? I said that narrow is good for high speed runs,
not for drag racing. You have bypassed the question I have asked. Why
did both CART and FIA chose to require NARROWER tires to slow down the
cars in their respective series? How do you explain that? CART races
are held on ovals and road courses and F1 races are held on road courses.

2. Again, you bypass the question. Why do people always run the widest
tires they can when, according to you, they should not? You just say that
"people do things they don't need to do". What does that mean? Explain to
me what "people" need as far as tires are concerned in a logical manner so
I can understand your position. If you could prove to us all that we have
been spending money on something that buys us no performance advantage,
you would save all of us money and you would be our hero!!

3. I don't know if the car with fast time had the widest tires. But that
was not my point. My point is that cars use the widest tires allowable
when they race. You are suggesting that this is not the best thing to do.
I want to know why.

Lets say my car with my 225/50R15s on the front and 245/45R16s on the rear
took 45 seconds to go around the autox course from a few weeks ago. Are
you trying to say my car would go faster around the course if I had
narrower tires? What size tires should I use?

4. Why do you say this? Throw some facts at me so I can understand!!

        Hi all.  I have a 94 968 Cab that slightly leaks on the drivers
side at the point where the normal window, the smaller triangular window
and the convertable top meet.  It only leaks a few drops and only when the
rain is exceptionally heavy.  It leaks ALOT when taken through the car
wash.  Yes, I made sure that the windows were all the way up and the door
all the way closed.  As much as I want to wash my car by hand every week,
it is difficult to find the time and energy after a full week.  I'd much
rather drive my Porsche then wash it.
        I have never owned a convertable before and therefore do not know
if this is part of the convertable "experience".  Should I just live with
it or should I complain to the dealer?  It seems to me that it would be
difficult to "fix" such a problem and thats just how it is with these
things.  Am I expecting too much or am I getting too little?

many thanks!

Onto another subject, I just did a complete 180 in my 911. I got out
of the car and kissed the pavement afterward. I got too used to driving
the 3000-VR4 (AWD very forgiving) and took a familiar turn a little ;-)
too fast in the 911. Don't you hate them late apexes :-)?  Somewhere about 
the apex the 911 broke loose (I'm gonna dig a hole and hide my face after 
the next sentence). Panic, I lifted the gas pedal. Need I say more? 
Luckyly there was noone around and there was no damage to anything. 
This brings two questions:

1_ How do you train yourself to resist the natural tendency of backing
   off on the gas in panic when a car's tail slides? 

2_ I often read/hear that one can tell when the tail end is about to
   break loose. Pray-tell the warning signals! I'm sure didn't feel
   anything (I think, can't recall much at this moment) until it was 
   too late.

The 911 C2 based Carrara RS that Porsche were shipping in the UK

I think there are a couple of piston/wrist pin designs.  An earlier
design (which is the one detailed in Haynes) was an "interference" fit
and was apparantly a much tighter fit than the later design.  After
removing the retaining clip I found that my wrist pins were easy to move.

 -Hi Group,

 -
 -The unit is a Champion/Scout Mdl 225142J1 from Evenflo.   It has a small

Check this one out, it may fit the 911 also.

Yes, they can be a family car,  and it is nice to hear my two year

Well, despite what some car companies' commercials would have you believe,
the aerodynamics of a Porsche seem to prevent severe splatter effects from
self-propelled feathered objects.  I hit a bird coming back from Myrtle
Beach a ways back, doing about 80 on the back roads, and it bounced off
the hood, doing not a speck of damage, and even seemed to fly away all
right.  The loud thwack had me worried, but it was spotless!

Since he said the suspension was rebuilt I suspect the funky (very
leaky) front suspension has been replaced (probably with an S from the
same vintage). Practically all Es on the road by now have been
retrofitted.

If the car is really straight and well-documented, I think the price is
in line. It just depends on the condition of the car. It could easily
be worth a lot less, or a little more. Of course as an E owner I am
obviously prejudiced.

Assuming the car really is excellent, and one *wants* a car of this
vintage, the price could even be a bit low.

I was looking at some older issues of Excellence and came across an
ad for PCNA.  It was for "vintage" parts and equipment. In this ad
Excellence Dec. 90' page 1, there is a PCNA PUBLICATIONS CATALOG
advertised. It is a catalog that lists PCNA publications, including:
manuals, bulletins, videos, catalogs, microfiche, posters, technical, 
parts, and quite a bit of other information. 

Part # PSM 000 006

If any body has one of these catalogs or knows where I can find
one, I would be interested.


**** Still looking for that "86' FACT BOOK" which was a PCNA

See above.

There *ARE* reasons to autox and take your car to the track other than
the sheer fun factors. My wife is certain that she's still walking around
because I made her go to an autox school that the local PCA region put
on a few years ago. A couple of days of instruction, some seat time
driving (think of it as evasive manuever practice), and she had a very
different outlook on things.

I recommend the same to *EVERYONE* -- unless you've got a rust bucket, or
a dying engine, you almost certainly won't hurt the car, you don't need
special tires or anything. Just go do it!

Hi there, Antonio,

David E. Davis is right, "Cogito, ergo Zoom!"  ;-)  However,

IMHO, if you drive *ANY* car fast, your first concern *must* be do do so
safely, because it's not only your life at risk, but mine too... Drive as
Fast is it is safely possible (that's *ususally* way over the posted limit)
but Be *Responsible* - Don't exceed what you know to be safe, even if it's 
BELOW the posted limit.  This ain't preaching, this is survival.

Your best protection from the ticket monster (and more *serious* hazards) comes 
from KEEPING your eyes and brain both *fully* engaged in the task.  Watch out
that you radar detector doesn't lull you into a false sense of security!

You want to remember that no radar detector is much good against Instant-on,
and most of the time you get hit by that, it's because the cop has seen you 
and wants to check you out (NAIL you).  There's a *Lot* on instant-on out
there (not to mention VASCAR and Aircraft).

Cops are trained to look over every vehicle for dangerous wrong-doers,
such as speeders like you & me.  If you want to survive over the limit, 
you've got to train yourself to do the same.  Always.  Look over *Every* 
vehicle for both obvious signs (light-bars and high-hats), and more subtle 
signs, such as big blackwall tires and the way the car rides on the suspension, 
the presence of a spotlight on the drivers side, antennae, etc.  Spot him 
first.  *Expect* him to be waiting for you over the crest of the next hill, 
Hidden in the median, in the middle of a blind curve, etc., and *watch* for 
any reaction from the other vehicles on the road.

Be *crafty*.  Don't be the leader.  Wait for some other intemperate hot shoe
to come flying by, then follow him by about 1/4 mile (give him more lead, the
faster he goes).  Stay out of the left lane as much as Possible.  Use your
turn signals and Signal your moves among lanes.  Watch for Bozo, and *expect*
him to pull out in front of you at the last minute (he will!).  *DON'T*
forget the guy behind you who is sound asleep at the switch.  If you have to
use that superior Porsche braking ability suddenly, Bozo will get you...

You want to drive as if you were a motorcyclist, assuming that every vehicle 
on the road is being driven by an idiot who is *OUT TO GET YOU* (and let's
not forget that a *lot* of them have cellular phones with which they *will* 
call the cops and give them your tag, location, and a description of your car 
and the activity you are engaged in...).

Yeah, I know... who asked me?  ;-)

I have done 180s and 360s both deliberatly and accidently in the
following: '85 Fiero GT, '85 IROC Z28 with high output engine.  I
haven't come close in the 911 though I've had the back end loose plenty.
I *think* that the tires have a lot do do with it.  Some will grip
great and *BOOM* all of a sudden you're facing backwards (Fiero and
IROC stock tires).  The tires on my 911 aren't great but I get a little
looseness/floating feeling in my butt and know it's time to start
playing with the throttle before it goes.  I'm sure suspension setup
and weight distribution have an affect too.

Hello everybody,

I have two quick questions:

1. I bought a new rear-view mirror to replace the ugly brown one in my '74. What
   is the best way to get the old one off?

2. I bought a 930S leather shift knob to replace the factory plastic one in my
   '74. The Haynes manual says the old knob doesn't screw off but has to be
   pried off. I pushed upwards on it pretty hard with a big screwdriver but it
   didn't budge and the screwdriver left dents in the plastic. I was hoping to
   get the knob off without damaging it. Any advice on how to get the old one
   off and anything I need to know about putting the new one on?

Thanks in advance for any replies,

I used Passport Transport to ship my '71 911E from LA to St. Louis.
They did an excellent job and were extremely professional. I would
trust them to be vary careful with any car they handle.

I think if you want to pay less you get usually get an inferior job, or
at least put your car at greater risk. You have to pay to find someone
who is reliable and who will treat your car as carefully as you would.

You may have looked in Hemming's Motor news already, but I'm sure you
could find a mid-priced open carrier there. You may be able to find a
cheaper closed carrier as well.

I do not think $1,400 is out of line for moving the car in a covered
carrier. (it may seem to expensive, but that's what the market is for
top notch transport).

I have no realtionship with Passport Transport.

	first off, if the thing has been in an accident (which it souinds like from
the description of the door) make sure the chassis is still straight.

	second, it sounds like this car has been neglected, which means
it may have a zillion problems with the ancillary systems (electrics, 
heater, lights,
cruise, a/c, etc.) these things can cost you a fortune to fix.

	on the other hand, i'd guess that in average condition, a '79 928 is
worth about $8k, so this could be a good deal. i'd have the thing inspected
by a knowledgable mechanic, so that you know exactly what you're getting.

	in short, if its really a dog (chassis bent, or major motor problems), then
its probably only worth being used for a parts donor for some poor soul

I wouldn't worry about birds.

I saw one (I think it was a pigeon) hit a P/U truck windshield on the

than a p-car.

Made a lot of loose feathers.

Very likely, depends on other mods to your car that affect the contact 
patch, and the speeds and cornering that the course allowed for.

If you were at the Candlestick course two weeks ago where you could 
barely hit 60mph (according to Hank Watts who placed pretty high in his 
2.4) you could have probably done as well or better with 205/50 Yokohama 
AVS, or 205/55 A0008P's, both of which would lower your car from current 
height, match your torsion and sway bars, and actually give you as much 
or more rubber during cornering, not to mention lower center of gravity, 
and less unsprung weight.

I'd also get some narrower wheels for auto-X, same those wide ones for 
time trials, track, fast autox, and for cruising in Miami though...<g>

Also, for those who are just so sure the carerra is faster than an older 
car with 3.0 engine, you might ask your local PCA director why a '77 with 
3.0 engine is considered too fast for the SC class AND too fast for the 
Carrerra class.  I understand I will be in the 3.6 class in autoX this 
weekend.

How nice, a voice of reason!

It would have to be a *very* narrow course.

However, I have seen the trubo and turbo look cars have this problem.

[p.s.  pretty much only narrow car, tires generally don't stick out 
past the fenders...   ;-)]

I'd agree with the hydro-planing and add snow driving.

Depends on what you mean by performance.

When I met my girlfriend, she had an '87 951 (with factory performance
chip) and I had an '80 911.

We met at an auto-x [romantic yes?].

What she noticed was that while the 951 is *very* fast, it takes a while
for the turbo to spool up.  The car was only competitive (for her - I think
she could have learned to lead the throttle a bit better) at auto-x 
courses where there was enough of a straight for the boost to come on.  

The other thing she realized was that if we hit an on-ramp together, I'd
initially pull away from her, she'd catch up by the time we were on the 
freeway.

Finally, she decided that the power on the 911, while lower, was more usable.

Now she has an '81 911.

I think the 951 would make a *fantastic* track car.

They are very fast (and the newer ones even faster!)

Handling is excellent.

Immediate low to mid torque is marginal.  I consider the low and mid torque
a very relevent measure of (street) drivability.

  An un-scientific attempt by the Ohio State Highway Patrol to see if these 
ultrasonic whistles would help cutdown on their deer strikes was tried a few 
years back and the results were to say the least, interesting.
  In a certain region of the state they tried a 50/50 split of installing these 
on "random" patrol cars.  After some period of time the cars with,  they had 
"twice as many car with deer hits", as those without.

  So they took them off the cars.  A spokesperson commeted that maybe they

Subject:  Re-assembling 914 engine halves 

I'm about to re-assemble my 914 engine, but I am having trouble finding
the "non-setting jointing compound" as recommended in my Haynes manual.
I've tried the standard automotive places in the area, but nobody seems
to carry it (or know what I mean).  The local auto machine shop
suggested I use something called Aviation Gasket/Adhesive paste.  It's
my understanding that I shouldn't use an adhesive if I ever want to get
it apart again.

Is there a name brand I should be looking for?  Do I have to get it from
the Porsche dealer?  Is it called something else?

I want to re-assemble this weekend, but I'm in digest mode so please
e-mail me directly if you can help me.

         much thanks...Tim Murphy (tmurphy@bnr.ca)

I've done the same thing, and I sure didn't feel anything before the tail
end broke loose.  Of course it was obvious when it did, and if I had reacted
better I probably wouldn't have spun, so maybe they're just talking about
recognizing what's happening in time to prevent it from spinning.

As to how to correct your instinctive reaction, I would think lots of
practice would do it.  I haven't done it yet in a 911, but going somewhere
you won't hit anything and intentionally breaking the rear end loose
repeatedly until you can consistently recover should do it. When learning
to fly I practiced entering and recovering from spins until the recovery
became natural (your first instinctive reaction is exactly wrong, and will
only make a spin deeper), so I know it's possible to change your instincts
that way...

I know 3 people personally who have done this....and when I get around to 
doing it, I'll be the 4th.

Derek Smith, Canadian autocross champ for 3 years in a row in his 914/6 with 
3.0 litre engine and 915 tranny.  He now has a 3.2L.

His friend Mike, running at first a 3.0, now a 3.2 with a 915 tranny.

My friend Kevin (who'll probably respond to you in a week when he finally 
gets through reading all of his mail) has a 2.7 RS spec with a 915 tranny.

I picked up a 3.0L engine with 915 tranny to install in my 1975 914.


Derek has said to me numerous times that running a 914 trans with a 2.7 or 
bigger engine, that the tranny *WILL* break.  It's just a matter of when.  
Stan could probably tell you some stuff to keep it from breaking - I'll leave 
that to him.  How are your CV's?  I had a small (oddball) 2.3L 911 engine in 
my 914 and promptly destroyed an inner CV.  My friend Stu does 914/6 "garage" 
conversions using 914 trannys and CVs and his CVs always break - although 
it's probably how he drives!  :-)

Anyhow, the 915 conversion will work, and works great according to Derek and 
Mike, but it's expensive.  You have to do it right.  Kevin's was done on a 
budget and he's had nothing but trouble with the shift linkage.

To answer your specific questions:

Shaft alignment?  No problem.

Length in car?  Use the same motor mount you have now, mounted in the same 
place.  Make a custom tranny mount...Derek has a "cradle" type of mount.  I 
can't remember if it bolts up to the frame, or on the 914 rubber mounts, but 
it goes *UNDER* the tranny to hold it up from below.

Linkage problems?  Yes and no.  Kevin has a custom thing with VW bus 
"tail-shifter" parts.  Nothing but problems.  Derek and Mike have the Vellios 
side-shift conversion kit.  Expensive but excellent according to them.  
Myself and Kevin are leaning towards the Patrick Motorsports 915 Cable 
Shifter.  Stan (head of pfiles) tried a car with that and said it worked 
fine and has a nice short throw.  However, Stan said the shifter is ugly as 
hell and he isn't sure about replacement parts in case it breaks since he 
isn't sure how long a company like them could last forever.  I guess the same 
could be said for Vellios.  He wasn't sure of which route I should take.  I 
figure if an expert like Stan isn't too sure, I'll go the cheaper route and 
save some cash.  The Patrick Motorsports stuff "appears" to be made well.  
The ad says: "All mounts and cable shifter parts made of 4130 Chromoly, Tig 
welded, Stress relieved and powder coated."  I figure if a part breaks, I'll 
try to make another with local machine shop expertise if the company is out 
of business.

Worth considering?  For a few minutes.  Like I said, it'll be expensive, but 
it'll work with any engine you may want to put in your car in the future.

I live in Canada, so I don't know where the best place to get most of the 
parts in the US is, but here's a simple breakdown (subject to at least 25% 
error in US funds prices!)  :-)

915 tranny, partially rebuilt
and converted for 914s             $2000
Tranny mount                       $ 239

- ----------------------------------------
Cable shifter                      $ 565
Dual mufflers (since tail-shifter
interferes with factory early
911 muffler or almost any non-
dual setup)                        $ 200
- ----------------------------------------
     or
- ----------------------------------------
Vellios kit (just "internals")     $1250
Late 911 gear shifter              $ 100
911 short shift kit                $ 110
Rest of custom linkage             $ 200
Muffler                            $   0 (whatever you have now will work)
- ----------------------------------------

Clutch lever fiddling              $  50

Now the stuff you forgot about: (I haven't worked this out yet)

Custom axles                       $ 400     <--guess
New CVs                            $ 400     <--guess
Stub axle stuff for larger CVs     $ 400     <--guess
New speedo                         $ 150     <--guess

  
That oughta do it.

Cable shifter route:               $4404 + shipping, taxes, etc
Vellios route:                     $5299 + shipping, taxes, etc

These prices can come down if you can weld things yourself and if you break 
some rules and do what is on Kevin's car for the axle stuff....his car has VW 
bus axles and CVs....closer to the proper length, but inferior parts compared 
to the 911 stuff.  You can't use 914 axles with a 915 tranny, they are too 
long.  911 axles are too short - they can fall out.  I've seen a video tape 
of this happenning.

The alternative to spending $4000 - $5000 is to buy a bunch of 914 trannys 
and throw them out when a gear breaks.  You should be able to break many 
trannys before spending $4000!  :-)

Good luck,

Allan

Subject: RE: 928 Hatch Release


John C. C. White,

I also have a '84 928S and have the same identical problem.  Even with the 
shortest pull and release, the motor does not cycle.  Perhaps it was by 
design.  Any other '84 or older 928 owners have this problem?

When I first bought the car, the hatch would not open at all via the remote 
release.  The dealer replaces the lock and latch on the door and it would 
open, if you time it right.  The dealer did not get a lock cylinder that 
would match my key forcing me to carry two of those HUGE keys.

After a few days I put my old lock back in.  It still doesn't work and I 
can't see why.  The part look in good shape with no noticeable difference 
from the new part.  Perhaps someday I'll contact a locksmith or the dealer 
about switching the lock cylinder from my old latch to the new one.   At 
least half my problem will be solved.

If you find a way to fix this, please let me know.
Thanks.

I'm not sure what causes the sloppiness, but I think I've got an idea on the
sound (sometimes) in first/reverse; the pilot shaft bearing which is in the
end of the crankshaft.  If this is bearing is bad, you'll get all sorts of
scary sounds; also, the car might shake or rattle under hard acceleration in
any gear.  Does it do that?
 
Anyhow, I just replaced that bearing on my `79 928 and it wasn't fun.  I'll

Two things,

1) Someone asked what was the best tire for a 951...
IMHO having an unlimited budget would mean buying Pirellie P-Zero's.
I love them.

2) Tire width and racing applications...

Not every racer runs the widest tire possible
I have found that on my race car (SCCA ITA 16v GTI) that a narrower
tire can be faster.. I have made a guess and contributed it to more weight
and drag of the bigger at accelerating and speed. (drag being wind and a bigger
contact patch)
However braking is better with the wider tire..

We used InterCity Lines moving both cars from SF Bay Area to Houston and
when we sold the Carrera, used them again to ship it back out west.  The
cars were handled with the utmost care -- in fact the Carrera was *Wrapped
In Plastic* for the trip "home" to CA.  We paid something in the mid $900
range for each car coming out ('91) and I think it was still close to a
grand for the Carrera to go back.  InterCity is a door-to-door service and
based on my couple of experiences, is well worth the money.  As an aside,
several rare Packards, a new Viper and a Ferrari were on the truck when it
went back to CA; coming out both P-cars shared the truck with two Mercedes a
C2 Cab and what looked like a Cobra (real one) -- the driver wouldn't let me
in to look at Mr. Shelby's piece of work up close tho...   :-(

Bob,
  The best advice I can give on buying a new 914 is to try to get
a copy of European Car for October '91. They did a great artical
on choosing a 914. In my most humble opinion the '73 2.0 was the
best. It came with both appearance group (center console with gauges)
and sports group (forged wheeels, front and rear anti-roll bars,
driving lights) standard. I would also try to stay away from the 1.8
fuel injection. It goes through air boxes fast. For all of your 914
questions I would call Automobile Atlanta. They are the 914 people!
Their number is 404-427-2844. They also have about thirty cars for
sale. Most being 914. There you can buy a rusy '70 for 2,950 or you
can even get a true 916 for 375,000. Good luck and I hope you find

Peter,
  Being the owner of one sickly 914 I have found the best place to
get parts from is Automobile Atlanta. They are very knowledgeable
and seem to have the best prices. They have a kit that will
"renew" first gear. I am not sure if that will help or not but it
sells for $375. You can get a rebuilt trans from the same place for
$950 with a $200 Core. As for the 915 trans... I only have a little
1.8 in mine so I can't tell you how well it works, but Automobile
Atlanta does sell a kit to convert the post '72 and later 911, 915
type trans to the '73-76 914 side shifter type. The kit will run you
$1,650. To me that sounds like a lot but if you are blowing out gears
every time you go-a-racing you may want to think about it. If you
are really serious they can even build custom gear boxes. Good luck
in your hunt and it must be nice to have a 6!

I use the car for regular commuting and pleasure driving most of the

signature (Guards Red Cab) set me thinking about the old piece of road lore
that says police recognize/observe/pursue RED cars (read Guards Red) more
than other colors.  If it's true then the Porsche community seems to have
adopted a particularly confrontational posture considering the relative
number of G.R. Porsches on the road!  Is there any evidence (anecdotal or
scientific or in between) which refutes or supports the old folk wisdom?

allthough black leather is welcome.

        I posted this about a year ago and got several responses from

there are better seats out there, but I would like to stick with what
came with my car.
        Thanks for any help in locating one of these.  I have tried all

        Thanks to all those that responded to my request about how to
apply the underbody sealer to my car and fuel tank.  Most responses
agreed that the metal should be treated with a rust preventative,
then primered and then apply the sealer.
        I have decided to stick with what the factory did and leave the 
sealer the natural grey color.  Someone suggested not applying the 
sealer and simply painting the underbody, but the little sound
deadening alone justified reapplication.

I've just done a LOT of powder coating of trim, door handles etc. on my 83 targa
and 64 SC Cab.  Its fantastic for some things and bad for others.  Powder 
coating is really tough stuff but if you're going to do emblems, beware because 
the powder goes on THICK and may change the appearance of emblems somewhat.  It 
also does not cover sharp corners well.  I would definitely powder coat your 
grill but I would ask your shop whether or not they can do your emblems with 
just one coat of powder (and still get good coverage) to avoid thick powder 
coating.

Alternatives:  I've heard very good things about a high quality spray paint 
called SEM.  It should work well on emblems just like any good spray paint but 
is nowhere near as tough as powder.

I looked into re-anodizing the emblems and engine grille on my '73 911 today. 
What I found out was its an expensive process and most shops are afraid to
do the work because they need to be sure of the type of metal or it may
be damaged in the process.  Most shops suggested that I powder coat instead.
     
Whats the opinion on this?  Is powder coating the way to go?  Have any of 
you '72 or '73 owners powder coated your emblems and grille instead of 
anodizing?

Subject: Sold in front of my nose...& 356 update.

Hi all,

Had a bit of a mail problem the last 2-3 days, but I'm back again.

The latest from my '58 rebuilld is a replacement of the rear of the left 
front fender. As I do not have a ultra fine metal saw (...as Pete A's.) I 
had to make an overlap. 
The Danish repair panel is huge, it covers the area from the front 
windshield all down to the lowest parts of the fender, and about 40 cm into 
the fender (forward). If I should have payed for what I used, I'd get a 70% 
rebate :-)
I cut out the rotten part of the old fender, and put the repair panel in 
place. Then I marked off the area I needed of the repair panel from the 
inside of the fender. Just remembering to include 1/2-3/4" for the overlap. 
Cut out the piece with a nibbler.(....which leaves a very nice edge) 
Once cut out I put a flange in the edge where the overlap was going. turned 
the tool and made punches for spot welding. 
Trial fitted with the door in place.(....remember door gaps) Marked off the 
exact location.
The rear of the repair patch has to be bent around the closing panels 
flange. I just took the metal snips and made cuts in the repair pieces flang 
so that the bending of these would be easy. Perhaps a Door-Skin plier could 
do this job better....? 
Spot welded the piece, used an ordinary but big plier to bend the edge on 
the repair piece. Use a wooden piece, slightly concave, on the outside when 
bending the edge inplace. Got a few small distortions, but I'll be leading them.

Quite easy really...!


I was in contact with the seller of a '65 911 just before my vacation, got 
him to send me pictures of the car too. But as my 3 weeks vacation went by 
the car got sold..... :-( 
Still a bit early, but I'd like to see a few before I decide....(...late 
fall, early winter.)

cheers,
Trond

I have found the best way (for me) to trick my mind into putting on
the gas when the tail starts to get loose is to convince yourself that
it really works. I am continuously amazed at how stable the 911 gets
when you put the gas on in corners. It just seems to make all things
OK. After having done this unstable/loose rear end to stable/all is ok
thing a number of times you will just naturally do the right thing. Of
course the best place to get used to this is at an organized driving
event as mentioned by others on this list. I have used the PCA and
SAAB/BMW schools in my Toronto, Canada location and have had the
opportunity to learn a huge amount in a safe environment.

A response to this point depends on how much you know at this stage in
your learning. If you are new to performance driving (especially if in
a 911) then I would say that you should simply put yourself in this
situation more often so that you can develop the "feel" of the car at
this almost loose state. You can definitely sense when this is about
to happen once you have done it a few times.

If you are a more experienced driver then the warning signals revolve
around a noticable loss of traction at the rear wheels as well as a
feeling of weight transfer to the outside, rear wheel. The car feels
as though it is starting to pivot around the front outside wheel.

Hope this helps some.

Steve,Stan (sorry)

	I have just been through this procedure myself on my '74..
 Unfortunately you have to remove the roll bar cover to remove the emblems..
 This can be a nightmare.. there are four studs that hold the cover on that
 are located under the wheelwells up near the jams... They are very prone to
 corrosion and can be a headache.. On mine the studs themselves were stainles
 however the nuts on the studs were plain steel and they would just spin on the
 studs.. I had to cut them off withough damaging the studs and there aint all
 that much room to work under there... Then you need to remove the Targa seal
 and the two side seals.. There are some plastic "bolts" and some smaller
 screws along the area where the seal goes.. Be carefule removing the seals
 and you can reuse them.. They are expensive!!.. once all of these screws 
 are out you can work the cover off.. It will probably have some sealing 
 compund bonding it to the actual roll bar but with care it will come off...
 The emblems are held on with speed nuts on the inside... Its an awful lot
 of work to do just to refinish the emblems.. In my case I wanted to do some
 work to the cover itself so it was worth it.. Anyhow hope that helps...

Subject: SC v. Carrera

I have been trying to stay out of this, but it seems the the facts of
how to size a tire to a car package has been left out.  The correct
size of tires used for "real" racing either on the track or at an
autox is based on working the tire to get it to the proper tempeture.
Each race tire, DOT and slicks, have a small temp. range in which they
work the best.  The lighter the car the less force is placed on the
tires.  The more hp. the more force is placed on the tires.  The only
why to find the best tire size for a car is by testing.  If the tires
are over heating, move to a wider tire.  If you can't generate the
temp. move to a narrower tire.  By this temp. testing, you can get close. 
  The next step is to determine the exit speed out of corners leading
into long straights.  The higher the exit speed is, the faster you
will be travelling at the end of the straight.  A wider tire will
increase your exit speed, hp. will overcome the drag of the wider
tires.  On slow autox corses, generally the wider the tire the better
provided the height does not the gear ratio to much.  As an example
SCCA CSP Hondas Civics and CRX at nationals all seem to run 10" slicks
on 13" rims.  These cars weigh 1800 lb. and generate less then 120 hp.
These cars will also beat most stock 911's with national level
drivers.  Another example as is F1.  F1 cars where achiving to high of
speeds, therefore narrow tires where mandated.  The reason for the
narrow tires was to reduce the speed of the cars exiting corners.  To
over come this the teams changed the ride height and downforce, which
now has been ruled illegal.  If you need more info on tire size read
Fred Phum's book called How to Make Your Car Handle.  There is a full
chapter related to this topic.

Martin,

After talking to you about our 1982 911 SCs this morning I realized
there were a few of things we missed discussing re. rebuilding your
own transmission.

1. You'll need a hydraulic press to disassemble the gearshafts.
2. The only fancy tool I've had to use from page 168 of the Automotion
catalog is their TL-3150, although the TL-3100 would likely be helpful
too. Maybe we should take a tip from the water cooled 944 porschephiles
and loan them to each other...
3. Your old clutch disk may be useful for getting off the large nut that
holds the 3rd & 4th gear synchro assemblies onto the input shaft.

Also, I have a few gallons of Swepco 201 which I've found helpful to
change annually. I can sell them for $25 ea to anyone who can either come
pick one up (in Boulder CO) or if we can figure out how to ship plastic 
bottles.

Nguyen,

This will be a repeat of what others have said but I only
learned how to drive a 911 4 years ago.

You can *not* safely learn the limits of a 911 by driving it on
the street.  The only way to teach yourself what is going to happen
and how to react is take your car out to a driving school either at
a racetrack or an autocross.  In that type of repetitive environment
you can slowly push out to the limits of your car and find out how
it behaves.  You can also use it to train yourself.

I have only looped my 911 twice, both times on the track.  Once was
in turn 7 at PIR (Portland, not Phoenix) which is a very fast left
hander.  It happened because of brain fade and I totally missed my
braking point.  There was nothing I could do.  The other time was
in turn 3.  I made a nice slow pirouette.  The turn worker even
applauded ;-).  I have learned the most about the handling of my car
from that turn 3.  It is a slow, wide, sharp left hand turn immediately
following a right hand turn.  This means that you get a *lot* of
sideways weight transfer entering turn 3.  I have had the back end
step out several times in there.  In this type of environment you
can play with doing nothing, lifting abruptly, or lifting very slowly
and see what happens.  The most amazing thing I learned (to me) is
that when something starts happening with your car you often need to
wait and *make* yourself react slow.

I have also been driving the car over my head twice on back roads
with steep dropoffs.  Both times all 4 wheels were loose.  I believe
that without the experience I gained on the track I would have lost
the car and rolled it.  In one case I would have gone quite a way
down a mountain side.  Which brings up another point.  Always use
your head and drive withing your limits and the cars limits.

All this is just a long winded way of saying, get experience in a safe
track environment.

Subject: Weltmeister PolyGraphite Bushings

Well, I finally have an opinion about the Weltmeister Polygraphite Bushings.

1) They squeak like crazy.  Not only do they squeak, the groan, they grunt,
they make noises like a 1972 Ford that has not had the zerk fittings used in
the last twenty years and, frankly, it is embarrassing in polite company.

2) They fail.  I just finished a track event at Lime Rock Park (NW
Connecticut, for those of you on the left coast).  The bushing on the
passenger side of the lower control arm (83 944 steel) rear completely
disintegrated.  Fortunately, my wife noticed that it was making more ugly
noises than normal and had me take it easy on the way home.  It looks like
it fractured internally and then chunks started falling out of it.  It
looked fine last week at the tech inspection.

So, my recommendation: do like I did and put those old rubber bushings back
in place, or at least find something with a bit of give, like delrin or
something.

Subject: 84 944 with weird electrical problem and other misc problems



Greetings,

I am a proud new owner of a 84 944.  I got the car from a Saab dealership
and they repaired a few things that I found when I test drove the car, 
but one of the things that was wrong was the AC not working.  I had
them fix it, but then I found out that the signals, rear wiper and
a few other things wouldn't work when the AC is turned on.  The
dealer has offer to fix it, but I am afraid he may jury rig it, just
so it will work.  

Sometimes I also smell smoke, the smoke doesn't seem to have much to do
with the air.  It did occur twice when I turn on the rear window defroster 
and I haven't turned it on since.  Needless to say I really want to get
this fixed.  

The another problem is the rear trunk latch, the switch will not open
it, but I hear the motor running.  Also the key doesn't pop it open,
so I suspect the motor is doing it's part.  It is just sticky some place.

The last problem I will bore you with is the antenna.  I think the
gears are strip.  Do I need to replace the whole unit or just the
gears and mask.

Can anyone recommend repair manuals for this master piece?

Subject: Baby seat in a 911.

Who was asking about a baby seat for a 911?
 
My son (age 4 months) has just graduated from his rear facing
infant seat. We were lucky with the infant seat; it would sit in
the back of our 911 with the rear seatback in the *down*
position. This, of course, meant that we couldn't use the seat
belt receptical for that seat but the belt is long enough to
reach over to the next seat & plug into that one. As a result the
front passenger's seat wasn't all the way forward or too up-
right. Easy for me to say, I never sat in it!
 
I forget the name of the infant seat manufacturer at the moment.
If you need to know tell me & I'll check. But I'd suggest you do
what we did & go to a baby products store with your 911 & try
several & pick the one that suits you.
 
The seat that my son has now "grown" into is made by none other
than Porsche! It's a three part seat (base, back & table) that is
meant to take the child from about 20 lbs up to age 5 or 6. It's
designed for the rear seat of a 911 but I think it will fit all
Porsches.
 
We love it. It's easy to care for (all three parts have washable
covers), easy to get a child in & out of, our son seems
comfortable in it &, lastly, IT FITS!
 
One problem. It's not for sale in the US. PCNA says that it would
cost more to have it certified here than they would make selling
it. Porsche Germany (I first saw the seat at the factory last
October during a tour) will not ship it to the US - something to
do with contractual agreements with PCNA. They will sell it to
you there of course.
 
Or you could do what I did: Find someone on the list who lives in
London & ask them for the name & fax number of a dealer in
London. Contact the dealer & have them send you the seat. (I'm
sorry, if I had the dealer info with me I'd give it to you now.
If you do decide to buy one of these seats email me & I'll make a
point of finding the info.) It cost about UK pounds 150 all up.
 
I hope this helps.
 
John.

Subject: Buying parts from Vertex


Milo Dorr wrote:

"The upgraded mounts (make sure you get part number 951.375.042.04) are
available for $119 each from Vertex in Florida ((305) 442-2727).  I
believe that this is the best price you will find anywhere.  The metric
bolts you will need are not provided with the mount, by the way.
Replace both mounts if they are not the upgraded model."

While I think Vertex has among the best prices around, I feel I must
give a warning given my 2 experiences ordering with them.

1) My 1st order was about $900 worth: a clutch package and a
cam/balance shaft belt & roller kit.  It took a week to arrive (in a
box nearly falling apart, I might add), and the belt/roller kit arrived
with only the cam belt.  No balance shaft belt, no rollers.  So I
called them up, and after dealing with a few insinuations ("I don't
know...this sounds a little fishy" they said to me), I finally got a
reasonable guy (Mike) who sent out the rest of the stuff overnight.
Okay, so I was semi-happy with that service.

2) So I order again: O2 sensor, oil pressure sender, bra, floor mats.
About $400 worth.  17 days later, I get only the sensor & sender (in a
sturdy box, however).  About 2 weeks later I got the bra.  It's been
about 6 wks now & I still haven't gotten the floor mats.  Note: no
mention of this kind of delay while ordering.  I called them about it,
and they said the mats were being shipped directly from the
manufacturer.  It's my belief that they simply wait for a certain
number of orders before placing an order from the manufacturer.

I've returned the O2 sensor because it did not arrive in time (I needed
to get my car smogged ASAP).  I'm crossing my fingers that they don't
give me a hassle about it.  Anyways, there's a lot of competition in
this business, and I personally feel like I've been hassled by Vertex
too much.  Zimms can expect my business from now on...

Subject: Targa Rear Defroster

I tried using the rear defroster on my '73 Targa the other night here in
San Francisco.  The window was fogged up so I pulled the defroster switch
out to the second position.  Nothing happened after even 30 minutes.  The
window was as fogged over as ever.  

How well did these defrosters work when they were new back in the 70's?

Whats the common culprit when they fail?  The knob lights up so I'm assuming
that current is getting to the defroster grid.

Subject: RE: Re-assembling 914 engine halves

I have rebuilt half a dozen VWs and on all I used a product called
"Form-A-Gasket" from a company called Gaska-Cinc (I think, this is
all from memory).  The can says aviation gasket on it (many small airplane
engined are air-cooled opposed, just like out favorites).  The stuff
forms a good seal and it is not too difficult to take back apart.  Try a
VW parts place; they would certainly know about it.

Subject: Stoneguard or Underbody seal?

I noticed that both the fenders on my 911 don't have the wrinkled sticky stuff,
(Stoneguard or Underbody Seal?) sprayed on their inner surfaces, like the rest
of the car.  The fenders I think were replaced after an accident.

Should I bother with coating the fenders with that underbody sticky stuff?
More likely to rust if I don't, right?

Subject: 911 Vent Windows

Just my opinion, but how many of you agree that Porsche got it backwards 
when they put moveable vent windows on the 911 Targas and fixed ones on 
the 911 Coupes.  German Engineering at its not so best.

Steve
PS- They got most everything else right though.

I found the perfect stuff for filling cracks in dashboards, tops of door panels,the rubber strips along the tops of the front door pockets on my '73 911 and

Rubber manufactured by Duro.  Very easy to work with.
And it dries hard.

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What can you tell me about the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          President, NetSmiths, Ltd.
          2025 Lincoln Highway
          Edison, NJ 08817

     He lives in Houston TX and works in Edison NJ (Don't bitch about 
*YOUR* commute): 
          Houston: e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
                   voice:  (713) 661-2084 
                   FAX:    (713) 661-0633
          Edison:  e-mail: stan@netsmiths.com 
                   voice:  (908) 287-8070 
                   FAX:    (908) 287-3883

     His cars currently include:  
          '81 Euro 911SC Targa (daily driver when he's where it is)
          '74 914 2.0 (SCCA ITA/PCA Club Racing)
          '64 356 SC (OK, so he fell in love again).

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How is the list maintained?
     
     The list is maintained fairly regularly.  Stan tries to handle
changes at least once every other day.  There will probably be times
when he's on the road and less able to deal with problems, so be
patient.

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  You can also 
reach Stan by phone at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070 when he's not
traveling.

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What about Unix-based mail problems with the list?

     If you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay attention to 
your replies.  The default will send the reply to the "porschephiles-
request" address, as it is the UUCP "From" address (first actual line 
of the mail header).  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT STAN ROUTINELY TRASHES SUCH 
MIS-ROUTED MAIL!  If your mailer starts screwing up, you will be dropped
from the list.  Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any 
more, send Stan mail and he will do his best to figure out what's
happening.

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the copyrights or ownership of material sent to the list?

     The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence
by and between members of a closed community.  As such, the copyright
for EVERYTHING that ANYONE posts lies with them.  PERIOD.  This is 
*NOT* a bulletin board system, where consent for further redistribution
is implied by nature of the the system; it's PRIVATE.  If you wish to
use something written by someone on the list, you must first seek their
permission unless they specifically grant the right in that specific
posting to reprint it at will.  And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD idea
to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing
up down the line.  Remember, when you read something on this list: what
you are reading belongs to whoever wrote it.  They may have plans to
publish it further themselves.  They may want to keep it "private"
(i.e. just for list member use).  They may not care what gets done with
it.  It's still theirs, and before re-use, permission must be
obtained.  Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a
big deal about it.

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available via FTP at tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/
Archives in five subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94) each of which has 
the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  Period!!!  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM
CST, or Stan may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to
mail you archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to
use BINARY mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX
"uncompress" program, or equivalent, to restore to textual format.

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What else is available in the tta.com archives in /pub/porschephiles?

     FAQs: This FAQ; also specific FAQs about specific Porsche models
are being added (so far there's only one, for the 914--feel free to
contribute one on YOUR favorite Porsche).
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
            1970.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914, 1976.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
            of the four-cylinder engine.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 as the 924S with the 944 drivetrain.
            Has the best aerodynamic shape of any Porsche.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the
            front, water-cooled, has grown from an original 4.5 litres 
            to 5.4 today.
     930  - Turbocharged 911, homologation and street version of the
            racing 934.

     944  - Front-engined, water-cooled inline four cylinder car, with
            nearly perfect 50/50 weight bias.  Sixteen-valve and
            turbocharged versions were produced.  Produced from 1982
            through 1991. 2.5 litre displacement, except for a 2.7 litre
            eight-valve 944 model in 1989 and the 3.0 litre 944S2.
     951  - The turbo version of the 944.  Built from 1985 to 1991.
     959  - Supercar 911 derivative.  2.85 litre, four valve, twin cam,
            dual turbochargers, all-wheel drive.
     964  - Another name for the 911 Carrera 4 and Carrera 2 as introduced
            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, due in showrooms in 4/94.

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:
Information about water-cooled cars is lacking; those with favorites
should submit them to one of the names at the end of this FAQ.)

There are also Haynes manuals available for most models.  While the
Haynes manuals tend to be very weak on specifics having to do with
different model years and variations, they are good at teaching how-to
procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other well-known Porsche people) here?
 
     Bruce was invited to join and did so back in '91. The load then
was too much for him.  All of what, 2k a day or so.  Now, at 15x to 20x
that load, he probably doesn't want back on.  He's not stupid -- he 
knows where we are.

     No specifics are available regarding other renowned Porsche people.

  Sreelal writes;

       A used door shell alone might run about $700. Accidents happen, unless
    it caught the rear quarter or front fender it couldn't have been so bad
    to cause any frame damage.If the door closes well at all you should be 
    okay, a shop may be able to save the door. 
         The loose shifter is really common, its happened to both our 928s
    and will cost you $40 for the new bushing used to anchor the front of
    the shift linkage. It is a pain to get to and replace (it rests on top
    of the torque-tube housing. You have to pull down the exhaust to get to 
    it. Replacing the part itself is a pain, getting it pressed back ontop
    of the ball it pivots on is easy once someone tells you to use a huge 
    (like 9") hose clamp to press it back on).
       A worn shifter coupling (to the rear at the tranny) will make things 
     a little sloppy, whereas the bushing failure makes things really bad.
     The shifter coupling is a little cheaper and easier to get to.  
      I don't believe there is a synchro on reverse, the grinding you hear
     going into first/reverse could easily be because of the shifter. Check
     to make sure that 2nd gear doesn't grind, this is usually the synchro 
     that heavy-handed shifters screw up (its a slow-shifting box).
           
        I guess my conclusion is (if you can live with the above) it sounds 
      like a low-mileage, average condition 928 WELL BELOW market value. 928s
      run and run and run, like any German car you'll have problems with old
      rubber and bad electrics, but they don't have any particular weaknesses
      and unless you hit something in the road or digest a wingnut the 
      motors really last. 928s are great handling, comfortable, and (in my
      opinion) a great looking 15 year old design. If the car drives and
      runs strong, take it to a competent mechanic and have it checked out,
      size up your own capabilities, patience, and tolerance and buy it ! 

             -Lee A, '79 928 

        ps. How many of you 911 guys would buy a roller for that money ?!

Subject: Hot running 911sc ??



I'm having a interesting problem with a friends 83 911sc. 

Background: 83 911sc 120k miles

	    The car will run fine until the oil gets up to 180. Then 
	it will continue to heat up until it gets going toward the red?? 
        We pulled the engine and replaced the thermostat, checked the top
        of the cooler,(was clean), and found the gauges and senders to be good.         The catalitic converter was shot. So we replaced that thinking the
	things was heating up and closing down causing back pressure. 
	(brand new cat). It still over heats. So we checked the pressure
	release spring and its good, uptodate, the front cooler is hot 
        so we know its working.  Does ANYONE have any other ideas cause
	we are running out of them!!

According to the book, you should orient the idler pulley so that
there is 0.5 mm clearance between the belt and pulley above the
lower balance shaft, while applying "0 to 1 mm of pretension to the
upper run of the toothed belt."  There's a picture and a diagram
showing just what is meant.

I've used Michelin XGTV with great daily driving results,
They last a long time, give good grip in wet and dry
(NOT ice or snow)
They ride fairly smooth and quite as well.
Best of all they are available at a good price.

Subject: 356 ,Still Looking for One-Help

I feel like the Duracell Electric Bunny; I am still looking for a really nice
356 C/SC coupe.
I have been in contact with many 356 owners who ,for one reason or another,
have deceided to part with their cars. Most have been quite honest and up
front about condition and history. However, once in awhile I have been
contacted by  short term seller. This is a person who could care less that
you could fly across the US to see a car that is not the "low mileage or
Perfectly original  nice ,ready to drive home car" that they represented. I
am learning fast.
My last contact was a seller bringing in a 19K miles car from Germany."It is
a part of a collection of a German owner who has deceided to part with some
of his cars. It really turned out  to be a faded yellow 64C that was picked
up here in the states.
So, my search continues. I must say the most postive out come of my searching
for a 356,  is all the terrific people  I have met and who have offered to
assist me by taking a first look at the cars for me. Thus saving me the high
cost of plane fares. The airlines do not give Porsche purchasers discounts. I
keep asking the travel agent this same thing over and over. She thinks it is
funny that I spend so much time booking those 14 day advance  tickets only to
cancell a few days berfore departure. Of course,we all know why.
Please keep in mind if any of you hear of a nice 356 for sale . I'll follow
any lead given to me. After all, I just want one.
Thanks again

There are problems with the drilled rotors cracking and breaking, since
the drilling disrupts the crystaline structure of the metal and induces
stress risers. The "cool looking drilled rotors" that you see on 
race cars have the holes put in as part of the casting process, and are
hideously expensive. They are also replaced every race, something you 
don't to on street cars "Hey Marge, I'm going to the store as soon as I
change my rotors...."

Go with stock non-drilled rotors. For pads, you have a number of choices.
Ferodo made an OK racing pad back in the '70s, but compared to the carbon
fiber stuff today, you'd be about as well off stopping by dragging your
foot on the ground. Given that you're mainly a street driver, the Textar
(i.e. OE) pads are fine. If you want a little better pad, try the Cool
Carbon red compound. If you were going to put the car on the track, I'd
suggest the appropriate "race car over 2000 lbs" compound, which I don't 
buy (my race car being under 2000 lbs). I *think* that's the green compound.
Anyway, those pads are spectacular *IF* you do the correct break-in on them.

Let me say from *extensive* personal experience that it's not RED, it's *any*

My *bright* yellow Corvette sent them into absolute spasms!  I even got
tickeded while stitting at a redlight - two seperate occasions!  

Disclaimer - If there are any cops out there on the list, this is not meant
to offend.  OTOH, every soldier knows the importance of Knowing your enemy:

The Police attitude towards attarctive sports cars should be no surprise when 
you consider factors like:
     who the cop usually deals with (the dregs of society);
     the work environment (long hours, dangerous conditions);
     the remuneration level the cop is rewarded with(lower middle class);
     the level of education required to be a cop (High School only);
     the attitude society often shows cops (portrays them as PIGs)
     
You have to ask "What attracts anyone to that kind of life, anyway?"  Two 
things.  The noble desire to make society a better place, and the less noble
desire to have and wield power.  It's not hard to see how time, and the 
conditions of the job can distort the noble motives, and result in a 
frustrated, angry, power-wielding person, jealous of people percieved as
having more than they, but deserving less.  We come along in our pretty
little toys (Known to be *very* expensive toys), and guess what...  the morale
is that if you own a *pretty* little toy, you can *definitely* expect
more attention and less slack from the cops.  Being *very* courteous without
being obsequious, sometimes helps; but like safe sex, avoidance is the
only sure bet.  Yeah, yeah, nobody asked me this time either... ;-)

If just the door is damaged, you should be able to replace it. Check very 
carefully to see if there is any body/frame damage. Get a tape measure 
and start measuring across corners (across the door openings, underframe, etc. 
Find a friend or friendly dealer to let you check the factory service

This could be the "Deal Killer". The 79's were the first year for the 
5-speed transmissions, and were of the "Getrag" shift pattern. That is, 
1st is Left-and-Down. 2-3 and 4-5 are in the H-pattern.

| | |  This was not popular in the US, so for 80-82  the gearbox was
1 3 5  re-designed to the more familiar 5th "Right and Up" pattern.
 
As such, the 79 boxes were only made for the one year. It is more than 
just a pattern change, as the 70's have the gears forward of the 
differential and a balance weight attached to the rear, and the 80+ units 
have the gears behind the diff'. Prices for rebuilt units have been 
advertised in _Panorama_ near $1500! 
 
Find a reputable dealer/mechanic and spend the $100 or so and have them 
look it over. As the tranny' could cost over half the value of the car, 
it's a small price to pay.

Look for water damage from the sunroof. All three of mine have leaked 
through there in varying degrees. There are two versions of the seal. The 
first, and obsolete, has a U-shaped rubber strip around the edge and a 
separate, second seal located about 1/2" inside of the first.
 
The second one that will cost about $80, has both combined ( OU ) and is 
used on the 944. The companion strip on the roof is only about $20, so 
replace them both at the same time.  If this seal leaks, you will find 
the interior panels (vinyl over fiberboard) curling up into strange 
shapes, and water will fill up in both the floorboards behind the front 
seats and in the storage areas in the trunk/wheel well area.
 
My Mom's 77' will fill 3" deep after a good rainstorm.
(Dad refuses to pay for a new set of seals ;P )
 
As far as options, there really isn't much that I can think of except Air 
Conditioning. The vents are really poor for getting cool air in, but work 
good for heat in the winter. Check to see that all the controls move 
freely and do not bind up or have any "squish" to them. Else, the cable 
will have to be replaced, not expensive for the part but another one of 
those really irritating jobs to do.
 
With the relatively low miles, the seats might still be in good shape. 
The seams split fairly quickly (as does the dashboard!). Get some 
sheepskins and cover em' up.
 
If the motor is in good shape (Short Block=$1200) and the other items I 
have mentioned check out, $2700 is a good price for a 924 in good shape.
The transmission is the part that I would have checked very carefully.
 
Yes, they don't have head snapping acceleration like a 911, but will do 
a real good job cornering with them. Besides, can you get Comprehensive 
insurance on a 911 for $600 a year? *grin*

Move to southern california, or maybe arizona/new mexico.

In the LA area freeway tickets are based almost allways on visual
speed checks. Therefore you dont need a radar detector -- you need to
look in your rear view mirror.

Radar on the freewy seems like a really annoying concept. Anyone got a list
of where this is/is not used. I would imagine its useless out here because
there are too many cars (5-6 lanes, usually full).

Keep in mind that pulling people over is an excuse to check for intoxication,

Assuming that various model years act about the same, the switch near

them to close the hatch--yet they don't pop up just from pressing the 
switch. However, they do trigger as soon as I get out of the car and 
close the door (i.e., jostle the car). I don't consider this a problem;
it may have even been designed that way. 

When you do get the hatch released, does it sproing up forcefully?
If not, then you probably have worn-out hatch shocks. You can either
replace them or get used to propping the hatch open with your shoulder.

In any event, I just wanted to alert you that even after you get
everything fixed, I wouldn't expect the switch alone to pop the hatch. 

Do other folks' 944s respond differently?

August 8, 1994
 
I just finished Day 1 of the Zone 7  Autocross School.
 
It was a very hot day at Candlestick park, until about the last hour
when the breeze from the bay came in.
 
The class is pretty full, about 50 to 75 people, and we're broken
down into groups of 20 or so students, with about a 2:1 student to
teacher ratio.  (We do a/b groups switching between running, and cone
picking upping).
 
The instructors ride in each car with us, and today we covered
about 5 different exercises including cachone, oval, skidpad,
figure 8, and braking exercise.
 
My two instructors today were excellent, they both race 914's, but
my first instructor and I spent half of our lunch practicing in my
car.
 
It's important to let them know you're an agressive driver up front,
or else they may be quite happy to not really push you and your car
to the limits.
 
I didn't spin out completely, but I did break loose a few times and
knock a few cones down here and there.  I took it easy with the 2nd
instructor, who knew I was pretty agressive, and didn't push the figure
8 too hard.  However, during the oval, she let me go for it, and I
pushed hard well into 2nd gear through the corners.
 
I do need better tires.  My rears are holding well, they are 195/50x16
Yokohama AVS, my fronts need replacing, they are 195x50x15's.  One is
a Nitto, one is a Bridgestone.
 
I highly recommend this class to anyone wanting to learn to improve
their driving skills in a Porsche.

Some people like Automobile Atlanta, some hate them.  I've spent a LOT of
money there and never had any trouble.  Even if you don't want to buy
anything from them, you owe it to yourself to stop by their location in
Marietta, GA and see the number of really nice 914's and 914-6's they have.
 Only place I know of to go other than the factory museum to see a 916 also.

Ever notice that you can't get corner balancing done at NTW? Ever
wonder why? That price is pretty reasonable. You figure that there 
is about $2k in just the equipment to do the corner balance if someone 
has a bottom of the line electronic setup, and that the life expectancy 
on that stuff isn't great. Plus the labor, which can be intensive, depending
on how hard your car is to adjust up and down.  A corner balancing 
should cost you about $200 to $300 done right.

I dunno about the $240 for the complete alignment though -- you will 
have the ride height set as part of the corner balancing, so they
can't possibly charging for that. I usually pay about $140 for a
four wheel alignment, and can from time to time catch the dealers running
a special for $100 even.

And, I hear via the grapevine that having Dwight Mitchell give you a 
corner balance and competition alignment will only cost you  a bit over
$1k. So it could be worse...

Got my "CARE" package from Stoddards yesterday.  Here's the results:

1.  Driver's side door handle (plastic) replaced.  Took about 15 minutes 
<g>!  Did not have to take trim off door then remove larger handle.  
Simply removed door pocket, leaving screw in the end by the door opening.  
Dropped pocket down to get at handle pin.  Popped off lower then upper 
clip (a bit tricky; I used a screw driver and needle nose pliers).  Drop 
out the pin; position new handle; slip pin in; put top clip back on; put 
bottom clip back on; pilfer pull clip from old handle and put in new one; 
snap in pull; reattach pocket.  DONE.  No Allen sockets necessary.  Door 
still seems to take a lot of pull to open.  Is there something which may 
need lubrication?  (I don't want to break another of these palstic handles).

Now, the bad news . . .

2.  Tried to replace a/c blower switch.  Old switch had burned out when 
the two top connectors evidently corroded then melted the wires 
together.  New switch ordered by part number (got part number from 
dealer).  Got new female connectors for wires.  Clipped off old one.  Had 
to cut two corroded/melted wires back about 3 inches each.  Tried to 
splice in new sections of wire for two burned sections.  Tried to attach 
ne female clips to wires.  Got them together long enough to find out that 
blower would work on position "3" only (high).  No blower/air on 
positions 1 or 2.  Now the bad part (those with children in the room, be 
warned; this isn't pretty).

a.  Could not get splice to stay together.  Tried electrical tape and 
those screw on plastic joiners - neither would hold.

b.  New female connectors were too narrow for the old wires.  When you 
tried to put connector on those wires (tried screwing them on) ended up 
with a bunch of copper wires wrapped up but not inside connector.  
Connector would not stay on wires (even with electrical tape).

c.  Spliced in wire was a little narrower so fit the new female connector 
better.  But still could not get connector to stay on the wire (and 
splice kept falling apart - see above).

d.  When I did get it all together once, I gingerly tried to put the 
console back together.  When I got the threaded post on the new blower 
switch through the hole in the console, I discovered the threaded part 
was too skinny - the ring bolt was too big for the threads, so I couldn't 
seat the switch in the console.

e.  Of course, when I took the console back out I discovered that the 
wires and clips had fallen apart anyway.  ARGHHH!  WARNING:  Kids don't 
try this at home!

Thus, I was 1 for 2.  Any suggestions on the a/c switch (other than the 
one my wife had - take it to the shop; the kids want to know what all 
those words you keep yelling mean!) would be most welcome (particularly 
on the splicing and the connecting of the wires to the new female 
connectors).

I have to contact Stoddards Monday re the switch.  Why would the blower 
only work on high?  Could it be the switch?  Why would the stock number 
be for a piece that doesn't fit the ring bolt?

Sorry for the long post.  Any help most appreciated!

Well, the threads in the heads are the problem.  Probably a result of
overtightening at some point in the past.  Eventually, you will
probably have to time-sert them.

In the meantime, using anti-seize is OK.  Just be aware that when you
do, the plugs (and fasteners in general) require less torque to get
the right interference fit.

They have a warehouse full of dismantled 914s. Some of the parts are
even usable. My *BIG* problem with them is that they grossly 
misrepresent the quality of the part being sold. For "core" parts
(i.e. things you're going to rebuild anyway -- heads, cases, engines,
transmissions, big pieces of metal in general) it's not too bad.
I've never got something that wasn't eventually usable.

The electronic stuff, or the stuff that's sensitive to wear/condition/etc.
all seems to be crap. Oh sure, I got lucky a very long time ago when I 
first started buying from him, but over time it's gone to shit.

Sure. And they're even ocassionally right. 

> Once they even accepted a return i had no questions asked. 

If you have to note the exceptions on that particular issue, it's
a problem. I just don't deal with people that don't deal with returns
and exchanges gracefully.

I buy a lot of used parts. I know what I'm doing. When someone tells
me that a part is "usable" that means one thing, when it's "rebuildable"
that's something else and if it's a "core" thats still something else.
Selling me cores as usable, and then getting bitchy about it when I
want to return or exchange it because "well, it *IS* a used part" is 
NOT my idea of a good time.

E.A.S.Y. in Oakland, Aase Brothers in SoCal, PartsHeaven in Hayward,

Three different brands of tires on your car?  Was this a carefully studied 
combination?  Taking into account your vast years of tire experience, and 
realizing that the subtle but important differences in compound and tread 
design between the Nitto and Bridgestone (both LEGENDARY brands of racing 
rubber) would provide just the right balance for your finely tuned but 
minutely off-balance 911? Or perhaps you trade the front wheels around, 
depending on the course...   Or maybe you like trying lots of different 
tires, but one brand/model at a time would take too long?

I have a similar problem in my '87 951, but my key will work. 
In the rear deck area next to the right lights (under the carpet), 
the motor you mentioned activates a small wheel/pulley that pulls 
on a cable attached to the lock mechanism.  In your case, the 
cable has probably slipped Off of this wheel/pulley.  

As far as the key problem is concerned, this happened to me once, 
and I kept turning the key and yanking the hatch until it opened 
Then, I lubricated the hell out of the latch holes on either side.

BTW, to respond to a related thread, my hatch doens't open by s
imply depressing the button next to the hood release.  The door
must be closed to give the hatch a thrust - I agree that this is 
part of the design.

I've seen this before. Once it was traced to a defective oil scavenge pump.
There was too much oil in the crankcase, not enough in the tank/lines. The

oil will start foaming, power drops, and oil temperature skyrockets.

Stan Hanks, you need some serious correcting here:

Re: "I dunno about the $240 for the complete alignment though -- you will
have the ride height set as part of the corner balancing, so they can't
possibly charging for that."

While it's true that you adjust the ride-height differentially on each
corner to equalize the weight of all four corners, that doesn't necessarily
give you the desired ride-height. Therefore, the shop should first set the
desired ride-height, and then proceed to wheel-weight the car. Both
operations eat-up time, so the customer should expect to pay for the hours.
Although not mentioned here, the driver (or equivalent weight) should be in
the car when it is wheel-weighted to get all corners within 5 pounds of each
other (unless you plan to send the car out on course without a driver).

Re: "And, I hear via the grapevine that having Dwight Mitchell give you a
corner balance and competition alignment will only cost you  a bit over
$1k."

Not close, Stan. Until he went to work for the local Porsche dealer, my son
Tim did ALL the corner balance and competition alignment at Autosport
(Dwight Mitchell). They charged only for the hours of work, unless the
customer also wanted new parts. The amount of time charged varied, depending
on the model Porsche (some are easier to adjust than others), from 4 to 8
hours for alignment, ride-height, and corner balance. I don't know what
their current hourly rate is, but you can guess and then do the arithmetic.
But not NEVER "a bit over $1k."

Passing along these kind of "grapevine" stories can unjustifiably hurt a
business. I'm not sure that was your intent.

How do you set initial tire pressure? I know how to adjust pressure depending on

My inside switch doesn't pop anything either, I just tap it once, and

If I use the key, I have to press down in the middle of the spoiler, turn

Like I said, when you corner weight the car, the ride height is already
set.... And it's *VERY* common to get a ride height that's uneven side 
to side, and fairly far off the mark of "standard" when you do a corner
weight. Point being, you can't charge for reseting right height as part
of the alignment (which should *typially* be part of a standard 4-wheel
alignement on a 911, BTW) because if you do so, it screws up the corner
weighting....

Most certainly not. Dwight's shop is one of the few places that anyone
should more or less implicitly trust for 911 performance work. My intent was
to note that this stuff *COULD* be expensive if done right by experts.

I just replaced the handles with some aluminum ones from Performance Products.
They were a bit pricey, but cheaper than paying the dealer to replace a 
plastic one three times :-(  

I saved your note, if I need to replace these, I'll know how.

Regarding the blower switch, mine is toast as well.  What part number did you
order?  I wish to avoid your difficulties.  

I also strongly recommend soldering the lugs onto the wires, and soldering
the splices, and covering the lug ends and splices with shrink wrap tubing.
This stuff is pretty cheap if you find an elec. supply store in your area, and
gives trouble free connections.  My experiences are from trying to keep
working lights on my boat trailer, no other alternatives ever worked for
long...

Anybody know why these switches are so prone to burn out?  Maybe a power relay
like those used for headlight conversions is worth considering??

Not so badly. They slotting only affects the surface of the rotor. You're

Subject: 928 Hatch Release - The Sequel


The problem: the little motor which drives the hatch release on my '84 928
stopped at random positions, wherever you let go of the switch. Mail from
this group indicated that this was wrong.
The solution: there is an in-line fuse which provides the power to cycle the
motor back to top dead center. Fuse was not obviously blown, but was open.
Got a replacement from an electronics parts store (Porsche dealer hadn't
a clue), motor now acts like it should. Note that this fuse does not affect
the ability of the switch to actuate the motor, just its ability to run
automatically to the desired stopping point.

Problem #2: the hatch didn't release when the motor did its thing. From
the mail I got, this is a common failure. I ended up elongating the 
slotted mounting holes for that same little motor down about 1/8 inch,
and the hatch now releases reliably with the motor mounted at the lowest
possible position. 

Assuming that I spent about three hours fixing this (figuring out that
there was something wrong, figuring out WHAT was wrong, tracking down
the fuse replacement, grinding the slots, etc.) and making the generous
assumption that opening the hatch from inside saves 30 seconds per event,
I have to open the hatch 360 times - maybe seven years' worth - to make
this break even. There must be some other reason why I did this.

My only other question is how did Porsche miss putting a "rear hatch
fuse blown" indicator light in the dash? They seem to have covered
every other event of interest there (I suppose you have to see a 928
dash light up to appreciate that).

I remember a few years back in Virginia reading an article discussing why 
the emergency vehicles were changing from red to lime green 
(visibility).  In the article, your "folklore" was mentioned as part of 
the study and, as I recall, the study confirmed that bright colors 
including bright red (like Guard's Red, not the dark red of old emergency 
vehicles), because of the higher visibility tended to earn drivers more 
tickets.  Bright red was singled out as "arrest me red".  Seems like 
common sense to me.  Although some nice shiny black 911 with the sun 
glinting off the Meguiar's/Zymol would attract as much attention, one 
would think.

want to order Ray Scrugg's $12.00 do it your self instructions.  

I haven't tried them, but I've seen him autocross yesterday and today, 
and he is very fast in a 914, 911, and on street tires.  Two of my 
instructors told me to watch him drive.

I've also been hesitant to pay $80 for four wheel alignment, when I know 
I'll be changing tires frequently, so I'd be interested in knowing how 
hard it is to do it yourself.

Ray's address is: Home Alignment, Ray Scruggs, 20A Scenic, San Rafael, 
CA  94901.

Tell him the grid worker who asked him "Does Home Alignment Really 
Work??" sent you...

I looked at the Perf Products handles, but the budget wouldn't stand it 
right now.  Besides at $8 for the palstic ones from Stoddards, I figure 
that's 10 replacements.  Now if Perfo Prods were to cut the price of 
those aluminum handles (hint hint) (if they're out there listening).

The part number was 911 613 243 00.  This was straight off the fiche at 
the local Porsche dealer.  It looked different too.  The one which fried 
was a white square with the five prongs on the back.  This one was round 
on the top with flat sides and bottom.  There was also a hollowed nipple 
in the middle of the back (center of all the prongs).

Hoping someone of you can help.  I want to adjust the steering box on a 
MBZ 300SD (1980).  I'm an accomplished mechanic - but with industrial 
machinery, not MBZ's.  The job is for a little-old=lady friend, widowed 
and on a fixed income, who can no longer afford the steep Mercedes 
mechanics' rates.  Here's what I need:
1) An explanation of how to adjust (tighten up) the steering box.  I know 
that the "set screw" on the top, that would be the adjustment on a '57 
Chevy, isn't it - that one must take apart the top of the box where the 
steering shaft enters... then what?
2) Information about a Mercedes newsgroup, similar to yours, on Internet.
3) Access to Mercedes Benz directly - anyone know their Internet address?
4) Any other suggestions.
Thank you all in advance for your help.

the top yet.  I'm in need of one and am trying to decide what to do.
The dealer price of $5000 is rediculous, I've seen them for $500 also.

The car uses a worm and sector steering box. If the box is worn, 
it cannot be adjusted. The factory does not authorize or sell repair
parts. The factory recommendation is to replace the box. The screw that
appears to be an adjustment screw  IS NOT designed to adjust wear --
it is for initial lash adjustment, not wear compensation.

My guess is that it is the pressure in the fuel system that is
lost after the car sits for a while. 

A friend of mine had the same problem, after 10 minutes
the car was very hard to start. He measured the pressure with
a home made fuel system pressure measurement device. The pressure
at the fuel distributor was fine for a couple of minutes and
then, all of a sudden, it dropped to zero.

Before he made the measuring device he changed the accumulator
with no improvements. A copule of weeks ago he visited Autofarm (GB)
and bought a new (additional) checkvalve to the fuel pump and that 
solved the problem.

Total cost with valve and measuring device was around 40 dollars
compared to some 250 dollars for a new pump.

Subject: Home 911 transmission rebuild

Martin,

After talking to you about our 1982 911 SCs this morning I realized
there were a few of things we missed discussing re. rebuilding your
own transmission.

1. You'll need a hydraulic press to disassemble the gearshafts.
2. The only fancy tool I've had to use from page 168 of the Automotion
catalog is their TL-3150, although the TL-3100 would likely be helpful
too. Maybe we should take a tip from the water cooled 944 porschephiles
and loan them to each other...
3. Your old clutch disk may be useful for getting off the large nut that
holds the 3rd & 4th gear synchro assemblies onto the input shaft.

Also, I have a few gallons of Swepco 201 which I've found helpful to
change annually. I can sell them for $25 ea to anyone who can either come
pick one up (in Boulder CO) or if we can figure out how to ship plastic 
bottles.

Do you smell fuel when cranking without starting ?  Does it seem like it's
getting worse ?  Has your mileage gone down ?  My problem got worse and
worse rapidly, I dropped from about 18 m.p.g. to 8 m.p.g. and started smelling
fuel.  Then one am the fuel line which had been leaking finally let go
spewing fuel everywhere.  Lucky for me it didn't happen the previous
evening coming home (I take the LONG way home when driving the Porsche)
when the ex. system was hot.  The problem occurred where the metal fuel
line from the tank to the engine loops over the tranny.  After 12 years
of resting there it finally fretted all the way through.  Thats one
of the reasons that my engine and transmission is not in the car at
the moment.

I have the exact same problem in my 83 SC, and I'm pretty sure I'm losing
fuel pressure when it sits, because if I crank it long enough (~30 seconds)
it eventually starts.

If it cools sufficiently for the cold-start injector to come on, it starts
immediately; this says to me that it starts fine as long as it gets fuel.

Apparently there's a check valve in the fuel pump that may not work, and
there is a separate valve (I can dig up the part #) that can be installed
instead of buying a whole new fuel pump.

Subject: Cool Carbon reinstallation problem

Hello p-philers, I'm in need of some advice:

I just put Cool Carbons back on my '87 951 for the second time, adding the
backing plates recently obtained from VCI.  I took them back off immediately and put the original pads back on because I now experience a distinct whine (more like a moan or rubbing sound) during very hard braking.  It almost sounds like a tire is hitting the wheel well, but it disappeared when I put the stock pads back on.

Two things I noticed when replacing the stock pads:

    1) The cool carbons with the backing plates were a little wide for the              opening in the caliper.  If the backing plates were installed such that          they extend out a minute amount on one side, could they be catching on           the caliper and not allowing the pad to move freely?

    2) I messed up and put the pad sensor wire *underneath* the pad retaining           clip on the right front.  Could this keep the pad(s) from moving freely          as well?  

Here's my next step, unless I determine that I did something else wrong:

    1) File down the cool carbon pads to be the exact width of the stock                pads.  This may involve just removing the excess backing plate that is           sticking out.

    2) Put the pad sensor wire(s) on correctly (on *top* of the retaining clip,         dummy).


Any thoughts are appreciated.

PS - Anyone know what the hex wrench size needed for removing the front wheel         bearings (on the side of the nut under the hubcap)?

This almost positively sounds like the fuel pump check valve.  
If it will ALWAYS start after cranking it for a while, then the
problem is the check valve, which is supposed to prevent the fuel
from draining out of the fuel lines and back into the fuel tank.
By cranking the engine for a while, the fuel pump eventually pushes
the fuel back to the injectors, and the engine starts.  You can try
and test for this by pinching the fuel line with a clamp, right
where the fuell line comes from the pump.  Pinch it just after
shutting off the engine.  Wait your 10-15 minutes, and then unpinch
the line, and immediately try to start the engine.  If it starts right
up, it is a faulty check valve.

It takes 10-15 minutes for the fuel to be pushed back through the lines
into the tank by the warm engine pressure.  It starts fine
just after shutting it off since the fuel has not had a chance to
receed down the lines yet.

I had this same problem on my 81 911SC, and though it was the warm-up 
regulator.  I bought one rebuilt, put it in place, drove the car
for 1/2 hour, shut it off, waited 15 minutes, and it would not start.
Luckily, the place took the part back.  It was clean, and did not look
used.  Next, I bought a new fuel pump, put it in, and this fixed the problem
right away.

You may be able to just get the check valve without the whole pump.

Subject: C4 Engine Shutdown

I'm posting this for a friend:

He has a 1990 Carrera 4 cabriolet. While driving on the highway at about 60
mph, the engine simply shut down. He rolled to a stop, and although it
cranked strongly, there was no success in restarting it.

It was flatbedded to the dealer, who was able to start it normally, and could
find nothing wrong.

Any net wisdom on this? My friend is now a bit nervous about starting out on
long trips, although the failure has not reoccurred.

Thanks in advance for any help!

Rich,
I was smart, I made the previous owner replace the top prior to purchase.
They are expensive.  I've been looking, because I know I'll have to buy one 
myself some day, but I haven't found anyplace yet.

I am pretty unaware of details like rain gutters on newer tops, but I am
certainly interested in finding out whether the electric top option can be
retrofitted, and (of course) for how much.

One thing I have noticed is that the new top is wearing through where the 
little plastic, not quite half moon shaped piece is screwed on to hold the 
back edge down on the sides, rubs against the top when in the down position.
I may have some small leather circles stitched on there to prevent wearing 
all the way through.  Any other folks have this problem?

Also, what can be done to preserve the visibility of the back window?  It is
pretty appalling, even after only two years or so...

Good Idea.  MO, especially on I-40, uses Instant-on (and they set up in the 
meidan, just over the crest of a hill, waiting).

Also, they use aircraft both on I-44 south-west of St Louis, an on the southern 
I-255 St. Louis by-pass.

Both Carolinas use it, and of course, (nearly) all HP cars are so *armed*
while cruising.  They like to *shoot* on-comming traffic.  Be vigilant on I-95 
and I-40 between Wilmington, NC and the I-95 junction.

Here's my $0.02 - 

	In CA the highway patrol cannot use radar unless that stretch
	of road has signs stating such. Therefore most tickets are issued
	on visual clocking. However, other local agencies can use radar 
	(although, I think, it still has to be posted) on rural routes
	and the like - and issue tickets on what could be contrued to be
	highway patrol domain.

	Here, in South Bay area, HWY 17, going over (and back) to Santa
	Cruz, is the BIGGEST highway patrol radar trap - the second
	being San Thomas EXPWY. Both have many signs to warn you of
	the impending doom. Since HWY 17 is a very fun road to drive fast
	and has one of the highest fatality rates in CA, it could be a
	good thing they radar, just to keep the young'uns from killing

       Sreelal, there is a big difference ! What might have been a great deal 
      for a 928 is a very ordinary deal for a 924. I think around Houston a
      924 in that condition wouldn't sell for over $1500.
        I like 924s, they are slow but fun to drive and practical to own.
      But I wouldn't buy anything older than an '80, I believe this is the 
      first year of the 5-speed tranny and the better AFC fuel injection. 
      The first cars (76-77.5) had cooling problems and cracked heads. Also
      The door hinges were pitifully fragile and tended to crack away from the
      body (I think this was changed by '79, you used to see lots of 924s
      driving down the road with drivers doors hanging low). 
        The 924 used an Audi-based motor, they are very stout and should last 
      a long time (compression check on mine at 95k miles was 170psi !). 
      Stay away from Turbos, the turbo itself had a habit of burning up. But 
      if you want a 924, get absolutely the cleanest around; its a buyers     
      market, the 944 has become the Porsche of choice and left 924 owners 
      either with abused, neglected hulks they can't afford to fix  or
      beautifully maintained cars they can't get a reasonable price for.
         Don't consider the 924 as an investment though--it is still an old 
      Porsche, (and even though parts are reasonable) rehabilitating a        
      cripple can cost more than the value of the car (which is why my
      very early '77 will probably never drive again, even with a spare motor
      and all rebuild parts already purchased...).

   The car starts fine when cold, runs fine once started,

   Does anyone have any wisdom here? Things I'm looking

Subject: Moving a Porsche

Paul and others moving,

We recently learned the hard lesson about moving.  If it is something
important to _you_, keep it with you.  United moved us several times,
then to Stanford.  No problem with the 914 riding inside.  944 went by
car carrier - I do not suggest anyone else try this - low clearance and
the car gets moved around by the driver as need be.  Moving from Stanford
to Ohio, the 914 went inside a United truck and to the best of my knowledge
it was fine (car went to Houston).  However, household goods were damaged
so badly that the Ohio Attorney General is now handling our damage claim.
That is after the BBB tried their best in dealing with United Van Lines.
Remember - moving trucks _do_ get into accidents.  Paul did not trust anyone
with his car (944) and he drove it with our four year old to Cincinnati
in 3 1/2 days.  Perhaps without a child along, the trip could be
shortened.  [My daughter reports that drivers in Denver are assholes, and
Wyoming doesn't like speeding, BTW]

I'm not implying that all United carriers are bad - but all it takes is
one bad agent or somebody having a bad day.  In our case, the packing was
contracted out, the Operations Manager fired, and no one claims knowledge
of who really packed our stuff - and that is from the biggest carrier in
the country.  

Porsches are for driving.  I say drive it cross-country and see how
beautiful the country is.  Driving isn't that expensive; Paul reported
30mpg (though I'm fairly certain he didn't drive _too_ fast with our
daughter in the car).

Just my remaining $.02

Which begs the question: is this problem isolated to the transmission

I had a similar vibration (65-75 mph) which I assumed was a minor front
tire imbalance. Turned out my front wheel bearings were in need of
tightening/adjusting and this eliminated any hint of vibration.  I did
not notice any gear selection dependence though.

I would suggest Jerry try accelerating in fifth or engaging the clutch
while in fourth to see if this is a drive train induced vibration. I
guess any number of mounts/CV joints/bearings could cause a
vibration... but why would this effect the steering wheel??

All,

     I have measured the rear camber on my '83 911, and want to
adjust it a little.  One side is 0, while the other side is -1/2
degree.  Decreased oversteer in autoXing is the objective.

     Can I adjust the rear camber using the appropriate
(according to the shop manual) adjusting cam without affecting
the toe adjustment?  If not, is there a rule of thumb for
compensation.  I can measure the camber easily, but the toe is
tough.

          I know I should just pay $ and have it done right, but
assuming it's out of adjustment anyway, I'd rather fiddle with it
myself and learn something along the way before paying someone to
set it right.

Subject:  Clean hands.

  Pete, and those who grime their hands on p-cars..
  Bleach is rather tough on hands, unless you *like* having 
  'lobster hands'.  Gasoline, paint thinner, diesel fuel will
  clean you too, but burns the skin and leaves you smellin' like
  your occupation.  Women dont like that either.  (mine dont, anyway)

  The best thing i've found for getting the gunk off your hands is
  a citrus based hand cleaner fortified with pumice. use a brush too.

  I like go-joe citrus with pumice. (it comes with no pumice also)
  This stuff can be used for many other things too..
  Like cleaning the adhesive off of your window after removing that
  sun control film (et al).  It really works well for this.
  
  Other uses:  cleaning clothing as wash enhancer.
               scrubbing an engine block clean without water.
               wet paint removal (skin, hair).
               stripping wax, age off rubber parts.
               etc, etc.

  I've used a lot of different things to clean stubborn gunk.
Castrol Superclean is the cheapest bang for the buck, the problem
with superclean is it is just too good.  I have washed the grease
right out of bearings on waterpumps and A/C compressor clutches, so
beware.  Ive seen this stuff remove damaged, dry paint too.  
  The stuff is a concentrated surfactant and will clean hands
and burn you like bleach.  The stuff does not leave an odor.

  I have not used 'mean green', but i bet it is just as caustic
as superclean.

  I've used that 'oil-flo' solvent that John Paterek recommends.
I didnt like it because it is three times the cost of superclean,
is not as effective, and *stinks*.  my wife hated it too...
  Oh, btw it removes labels or their printing, so beware.

  Stan likes to use carb and choke cleaner for many things, this
stuff is fairly tough on petroleum based gunk but is not suitable
for cleaning upholstery or anything else not metal.  Having used
the superclean and citrus based cleaners provide a handy and 
effective alternative to degreasing without sterilizing yerself.

I called them up at a later date asking about putting a 914 on a rotisserie.

"How stripped is stripped?" the guy repeated his response in a gruff tone.

My friend was dealing with George Hussey about importing a car to Jamaica and

Now I hear that they are selling the 916 for $375,000.  George bought that 
car 15 months ago for $116,000.  Are the rest of his parts subject to the

Subject: 944 elec fan won't stop

I seem to recall some talk a while ago about a similar condition but since
I thought my system was fine, (it WAS at that moment) I paid no attention.
Now of course I have a problem in that the electric fan(s) continue long
after the engine is shut off. Fortunately I suspected that something was
wrong and I disconnected one of the battery terminals to save the battery.
HOURS later the fan came back on when I reconnected the battery. Turning
the key caused the fans to crank up to the high speed.

The question is, where is the likely source of the problem? Obviously one
suspect is the switch that screws into the radiator but is there also a
relay in the box-o-relays by the firewall?

While we're talking about those relays, is there any way to easily
determine if it's the relay (and which one?), the steering column mounted
highbeam stalk or the rocker-type selector switch that casues my foglights
to ignore my requests to come on?

As always, any ideas will be most welcome.

Subject: Porsche news

Hi Porschephiles,

I recently bought the July 15 issue of Auto motor und sport, the German
biweekly and IMHO the best automotive magazine around (if you can read
German) and found several articles that I thought the group would enjoy.
   
1. The production output for the 928 and 968 are at rock bottom. Porsche had
initially planned to produce 35 968s per day when it first came to market 3
years ago, unfortunately output is down to 8/day. These are basically all
sent to England and the US.  The article points out that it is no surprise
that most 968 are sent to the US because the price difference is incredible.
 $39,000 US price vs DM 97,440 ($ 62,870 - $1=1.55 DM).  I'm only quoting the
US price, I think it may actually be a little higher. As for the 928, output
is down to 3/day. 

2. The good/bad news.  The new 911 is being produced at a record 76 cars per
day. Which is great for 911.  However, they say that the future of Porsche
now rests on the 911 until new cars are produced (i.e. the Boxster).. Porsche
also lost DM 110 million in the fiscal year 93/94 ending in July. But based
on their sales so far this year, I think they will be close to breaking even.
Hopefully. 

3. After poor results in the 1991 Formula 1 season, Porsche will return to
Formula 1 in 1995 with a V10 powerplant going to the McLaren team.

4. On a side note, there was also a comparison test between a 1960 Porsche
356 Super 90 conv. and a 94 Volkswagen Golf TDI.  The TDI is VW's  newest
super fuel efficient turbo diesel engine. The point behind their comparison
was to compare two 90hp cars from different eras: one classic, where
performance was key, and one where efficiency is most important. The 356
looks beautiful and definitely is one of my dream cars. In terms of
performance the 356 hits 100km/h in 13.6 sec (1.4 sec. behind the Golf which
has much more torque)  and tops out at 188 km/h (or 117 mph). The Super 90
only out accelerates the Golf after 140 km/h. The only advantage the Golf has
is that it is twice as fuel efficient as the Super 90. But who cares, there
is no comparison. I'll take the Porsche. If anybody wants more info from this
article, e-mail me and I'll try to send it to you.
 
Sorry about the long thread. Hope it was of some interest.

Hi,

for what its worth, the symptoms you described are the same 
as those I had until I changed the DME relay on
my 944 (1986). The dealer checked the car for 4 hours
and could not find the problem. It's because the problem
is intermittent and therefore hard to find.

I don't remember what DME stands for. I was well versed 
on the subject at the time I had the problem. However, I know
that it is the relay that controls the flow of fuel injection.

Hope this helps.

Jay,

The towing eye is used to allow the winch of a flatbed to pull the car up the
incline onto the bed.

It could be useful at a track event to have your car towed back to the pits
with a web type towing strap if used at _low_ speed. Clearly, it could not be
used for any great distance or speed in over the road towing as you would
need to ride in the car to steer (without power assist)
.

BTW, this may be worth the bandwidth to repeat in case it saves someones car:

If you are going to stay in your car to steer it while it is pulled at low
speed with the towing hook, REMEMBER TO TURN THE KEY TO UNLOCK THE STEERING
WHEEL!! If you forget, it will be too late by the time the wheel is pulled
hard against the locking teeth in the column. The person who taught me this
learned the hard way...

Subject: 911 Fuel Injector Pre-heat Hose

Am reassembling a 2.4L 911E engine.  When I took it apart, it
had a *very* heavy rubber hose from the left heat exchanger to
the engine tub (where there is a feed-thru fitting) followed by
a light, flexible hose from the feed-thru to the mechanical
injection pump.  The heavy rubber hose was charred, and hard as 
a rock.

I assume that I should replace the heavy hose with a heavy
hose, rather than the flexible kind ususally used to deliver
heated air around engine compartments.  My assumption is that
this is a high heat area, although I don't know why it is any
hotter than other places on the heat exchangers where hoses
are attached.  

The Parts Manual simply calls the hose a hose, and doesn't indicate
whether its rubber or of the flexible type.

This is a long posting for a simple question.  Does anyone know
what's supposed to go there?  Can I use the usual flexible stuff?

Subject: Re: C4 Engine Shutdown

A very long time ago I had an early example of a Bosch-brainbox-controlled
FI automobile that periodically would totally cut out and leave me on the
side of the road; flinching as the traffic roared past my left elbow. It
was a '68 VW Squareback which I purchased new and in so doing violated the
axiom, 'never be the first to buy or the last to try' since this form of
induction that is so common today was VERY new at the time. I will certify
that the concept was definitely unfamiliar to most of the mechanics (yes
even those from VW) that touched my car after it coasted to a stop on this
or that stretch of highway. They had little idea of how to diagnose and fix
the system and often seemed to doubt that there was a problem (except in my
head) since the car ran fine by the time it got to them.

So what's this got to do with your friend and his 1990 Carrera 4 cabriolet?
Well to the extent that there ever was any agreement on my car's problem it
was that there was an intermittant section of circuitry in that pesky
brainbox which was temperature dependent. In other words if I could just
find something else to do during the fifteen or twenty minutes when
torching the eff'ing thing seemed so attractive, it would cool down or
otherwise (temporarily) heal itself and I could procede with my commute or
trip to Grandma's. The problem was, I could never reproduce the symptoms
for the skeptical mechanics. Grrrrrr!

Eventually I swapped cars with the service manager for the whole Northeast
Region and he drove my car until the magic day he called me from the
highway as he waited for a tow truck. Then it got fixed by a swapout of the
only thing that hadn't been replaced to that point, the brainbox. 

Bottom line... this kind of problem is VERY frustrating and may only yield
to dogged diagnosis and costly part swapping. It *almost* put me off of
German cars for life. Now wouldn't THAT have been sad.

I just received my roll bar (suitable for vintage racing) from AutoPower of

nice and heavy too; a piece of mind in case 'things' get a little out of hand.
In fact, I liked it so much I bought one for my 928, and it should be ready

through several catalogs who carry AutoPower roll bars.  And both are bolt-ins
with all hardware needed.

I get the wheels repaired without having to get the alignment done all

Hello Fellow Porschephiles:

I can now make that greeting because I finally became the owner of my first 
Porsche.  On Friday night I finalized the purchase of a 1989 944 Turbo.  What a 
fun car!  On Sunday I took it to my first Autocross, temporary plates and all.  
I didn't knock down any cones and I managed to stay on course, but boy was I 
slow.  I learned one thing...I have a lot to learn about driving this car.

Thanks to all those who answered my questions throughout the search, especially 
those of you in the D.C. area who took time out to look over some of my 
prospective candidates.  Your help was greatly appreciated.  Now for a couple 
of more questions...

1.  Has anybody used the car history service provided through PCNA?  Is it 
worth the $20?  What do you get for the money?  I am thinking of doing this and 
would appreciate any feedback.

2. Tires.  I currently have Pirelli P-700Zs all around.  The two in front are 
new, the ones in back ave about 3/32 inch tread left in the center.  These were 
extremely slick during the Autocross.  What tires do people recommend which 
would be a good mix for both daily driving and occasional track events?  I cant 
afford two sets of wheels right now and I do not own a tire changing machine 
for monthly swaps.

Please respond directly to me unless you feel your response would benefit the 
entire group.  Thakns in advance.

You need to lubricate the hatch where the hatch studs stick into

Lou,

Could have been a whole bunch of things.  Did the dealer not read
fault codes out of the Motronic?  It still may be possible to do so,
and I recommend your friend get it done as a first step.

Failing that, I would disconnect the battery for ten minutes, restart
the car, and try to catch a bad sender before the ECU compensates for
it.  And failing that, complete break-out, check all the senders.

Slight chance that he just burped some bad gas.  Check the filter,
replace it.

What do you recommend for lubricant for the cables and sliding surfaces

"Lubricate all parts thoroughly with a special grease, e.g. Golde LS 2049
(application range from 20 to 90 degrees C.)"

What do they mean by "special?"  That application range?  That doesn't seem too
special to me.

The sunroof mechanism in the 911 is basically the same, I think, so presumably
some of you have had good luck with some readily available (in the US)
lubricant.

Any suggestions?

Subject: Coolant Brands and other stuff ...

You air cooled guys can skip this one, this is for the ultra hip water
coolers only !!!

Earlier this summer, I refilled my coolant system in my '84 944. The previous
coolant was standard Prestone and water (50/50) - which was put in by the
former owner. Being the type of guy I am, I wanted to refill with phosphate
free antifreeze and distilled water. When looking around for phosphate free
antifreeze, I found it somewhat hard to find (I live out in the boonies and
if WallMart dosen't have, oh well ...). In any case, I ended up getting this
new Prestone that's phosphate free (it came in a grey bottle and was $9.00 a
gallon at WallMart).

Well, the car ran quite a bit hotter with this stuff. Anyone know why this
would be? I noticed that the cooling fan wouldn't come on until the needle
was almost in the red zone (I suppose the new coolant didn't lose/gain heat
as quickly as the old stuff). The fan would shut off when the needle was at
the 3/4 mark (which I found to be hight). In general, the car operated a
quarter notch higher on the temp scale than with the ordinary Prestone. What
gives?

I drained the phos. free antifreeze out and put regular Prestone (at
$3.00/gallon) back in the car. It now runs cooler again (the same as it did
before this whole fiasco).

So hey fellow watercoolers, what gives? Anyone have similar experiences? Any
suggestion for a really good brand of coolant? All of my above observations
were with a 50/50 blend of coolant and distilled water. Any suggestions would
be very cool.

Oh yea, the Prestone in the grey bottle sucks big time ...

I would say that this is most certainly the thermo switch in the rad. They
are known too fail. Also, if the fan runs with the car off, it is probably
the switch since the current (for the slow fan speed when the car has been
turned off) dosen't run through a relay, it goes directly through the switch
to the fan (via a ballast resistor to keep the fan at the slow speed).
Therefore, the relay is not the problem (if the relay was stuck, the fans
would run at fast speed continually when the car was on, but they would shut
off when the car was turned off).

The thermo switch is an easy fix. When you get one, make sure you get the
little o ring gasket that goes with it. Also, be *VERY* careful about
screwing this thing into the rad as the rad is made of a very light alloy
(plastic ???) and is very easy to strip out. Screw is in until snug and then
just another quarter turn or so. When you get the thing in, fire the car up
and check for leaks when the car warms up. If it leaks, let the car cool
again and tighten a little more. This is a little tedious, but it is better
than stripping out the hole in the rad, and if you are not familliar with how
tight this baby should be, then play it on the safe side.

You will lose some coolant  (if you haven't drained the system already), so
you will have to refill the system with coolant and purge the system or air
(or the car will overheat - not a good thing). The Haynes manual covers this
stuff pretty well (with the exception of the warning about going easy on the
switch when screwng into the rad ...).

Well, that's my stupid suggestion of the day.

Uh, there's some understandable disagreement on this point.  This was
the subject of debate on the mercedes list about a month ago.  Someone
finally produced proof that the gear box is in fact supposed to be
adjustable--a direct quote from one of the Mercedes shop manuals with
directions for how to adjust the steering box (sorry, but I have to
direct your to the list's archives for details.)  And my own
experience also suggests that it can be adjusted: Park Avenue Motors
(in Palo Alto, CA, tel:415-494-0311) adjusted the steering gear box on
my '79 240D (same as the '80 300D, I believe) just last year,
successfully getting rid of all of the free play in the steering.

Subject: Questions regarding Porsche 914/4s 

 -Hello-

I am looking to purchase a Porsche 914 and I have a few questions that I 
can not find the answers to from the local city/county/university/college 
libraries or from any Motorbooks International books.  I would appreciate 
any and all inputs.

Was the 914/4 produced from 1969 to 1975 ?

What are the problem areas to closely inspect on the 914 ?  I already 
know of the potential rust problems near the battary tray.

I have read that 1973 and later 914s are the best buys due to the 2L 
FI four, improved shifting linkage and movable seats.  Which year is THE 
best year for the 914/4 ?

What is a fair price to pay for say a 1973 or newer 914/4 in excellent, 
original condition with a sick engine that requires rebuilding ?  I will 
be doing my hunting in Central/Southern California.

Were there any "special, aniversary or etc. editions" of the 914 ?  Are 
they sought after, and do they have any worthwhile goodies ?

What options were available on 1973 and later 914/4s ?

What are the widest and tallest radial tires that I can correctly fit on 
STOCK 914 rims and have them perform with no rubbing ?  205x75x15s 
perhaps ?

Does anone make a quality header that simulates the sweet exhaust note of 
a Carrera for use on the 914/4.  Please, no flames, or smart-assed remarks.

A local machine shop/engine builder (he does about 6 VW and/or Porsche 
engines a week) has quoted me $920.00 for a complete long block rebuild 
on a 2L four using all new parts.  I trust his work very much.  Is this 
price in line with other quality shops ?

Is the Bentley book a good reference for rebuilding a 914 ?  They are 
rather pricy and I would like to know before I place an order.

Intermittent failures in electronics are really annoying. The manufacturers
tries to screen these latent defects out of the product during production
by applying environmental stresses (thermal cycling & vibration). The thing
is that environmental stresses are needed to repeat the failure that occured
intermittently, but this is not not done of cost reasons.

The major problem is to pinpoint where the failue is located. To buy a
new controlbox is depressingly expensive. And it is not always the computer...
My previous car, a Peugeot 205 GTi, stopped all of a  sudden when I ran on a
stone laid road. I feared that it was the computer but got the advice
from a workshop that I should check every electrical connector and
hose in the engine compartment. I did so so, found no failure, but all
of a sudden the car ran great again. I had no clue what I had done that
had "repaired" the failure. I met the new owner the other day and the car
still runs great 4 years after the incident.

Intermittent failures can give you sleepless nights! I'm, therfore,
a bit sceptic about the ever increasing complexity of todays cars.

Bob,

I am not sure how camber changes will affect oversteer. But I do
not see how it can make a big difference.  More negative (within
reason) will have to affects:

1. Improve the cars ability to go fast around corners.

2. Decrease the cars ability to stop.

The first is true because the contact patch of the outside tire (the
one bearing most of the load) will be more parallel to the ground.
This means more rubber on the road at the right tire.

The second is true because less rubber is on the and will actually
decrease as the front of the car dives during braking.

Most people feel the extra speed in the corners offsets the decreased
braking ability. This is also true since Porsches tend to have more
than enough brake and not enough negative camber.

Also, depending on you 911 and what has been done to it, I suspect that
your car has far to much understeer, not oversteer. Pushing (under-
steering) through turns on the autox course wastes prescious seconds
with stock or near stock 911's. Before you go changing your cars\
suspension setting to reduce oversteer, have one you regions hot shoes
take you out in your car. Ask him (or her) if they think your car
has an understeer or oversteer problem.

A really fast autox'er told me that you want a car that is so loose
(oversteer) that you can barely controll it. This will give you the
best times (if you truly can control it!!). I realize this is most
likely your dailey driver, so I am not suggesting you build a death
trap for the street. I am suggestion that you car probably has way
to much understeer and you just don't know it....

The problem is that wear is ususally localized and not evenly distributed
in the box. Adjusting the free play with the wheel centered often leads
to the box siezing during a turn -- hence the Official recommendation is
to replace and do not attempt to adjust.

  I seem to recall a few months back (late '93) Car & Driver published such a 
list of car types/colors and radar equipment in use.  This was on a state by 
state basis.  In Ohio, not just the State Patrol, but local townships/cities/ 
speed traps use radar and laser (donated by a local insurance company :-( ).

  In general, drive safe, be alert (carry a good radar/laser detector) and keep 
a low profile.  By the way, on a side note, in a computer graphics book I read 
that the human eye has more red receptors, then green, and more green then 
blue.  So not just the shape of a Porsche, but the Guards Red will also excite 
the brain more.... :-)

Subject: replacement fuel line on 911

Hi you lucky so 'n' so's whose porsches run, 

As you may remember I'm doing a few odds 'n' ends on my 911.  One of the
odds is replacing a busted fuel line.  This is the line that runs from
the firewall (just under and to the left of where the shift linkage
protrudes from the tunnel) to the fuel pressure thingy in the engine
compartment.  This originally was a steel tube and had chafed through
due to being routed by, and rubbing on, the transmission.  I'm thinking
of replacing this with a flexible hose.  I'm considering two different
hoses.

One is billed as "fuel injection hose" and is a fluoroelastomer veneer
inner tube with a multi-fiber braid reinforcement and finally a 
polyethylene cover.  It has a temp. rating of -30f to +275f, a working
pressure rating of 125 psi and a burst rating of 900 psi.  This is a
1/4" ID and 1/2" OD hose with a min bend radius of 3".

The other is a teflon inner tube with a single stainless steel braid
on the outside.  It's 1/4" ID and 23/64" OD with a bend rad of 3" also.
It's got a much higher pressure rating, 3000 psi working/12000 psi burst.
It's temp range is better too - -65f to +450 f.

I'm going with flexible hose because of ease of installation and I may
want to route it a little differently to avoid the chafing problem.  I
like the teflon tube because of the higher temp rating and outer stainless
(chafe protection) braid.

Any comments ?

I am a novice auto mechanic in need of some advice from the p-phile 944 brain
trust.  My 87 944 has a very slow oil leak that I've been trying to find for
quite awhile.  I can not find any areas where there is a leaky seal/joint. 
My mechanic could not find any leaks either.  Judging from where the oil
accumulates it looks like there is a pinhole leak that is allowing the oil to
mist on components to the side and beneath the oil filter.  I've  replaced
the oil filter many times with no improvement.  My suspicion is that it is
coming from the component that the oil filter mounts on.  My questions are as
follows.

1.  Is my analysis of the problem reasonable?  Are there other possible
explanations/things that I should be looking for?
2.  What is the name of the component that the oil filter mounts on?
3.  If there is a pinhole in the item of question 2, where can I get a
replacement (inexpensive if possible) and how difficult would it be for a
novice to replace?

I am thinking of ordering a used 11-blade fan from Kempton Bros.  Any
opinions from the Net?  If you could please respond directly to me, I'll
post a synopsis when it all comes in.  The sooner a response the better -
I need to get mine replace before my hub's "pulleyitis" becomes terminal,
my wallet is laughing at me, but I'm always leery of used parts places I
haven't dealt with before.  I'm also curious about Parts Werks of Chicago,
though I've heard of Kempton more.  Just can't remember whether it was
good or bad.

Did you make sure you burped the system when you were done the first time?
I helped a somemone put a new radiator in a 944 once (Hubert Lai) and we
had the exact same symptom until we loosened up the bleeder screw on top
of the thermostat and bled the air out.  Just a thought, not meant to insult

I did timer and grid work for the 914 group,(excellent work place to

it's a 6 or a 4.  I'm sure it's noticable in time trials, but from what I 
have seen, a 4 with sport exhaust can be louder, and on a tight course, 
the 4 with proper gearing can probably keep the speed of the 6.

the balance work with the wheel in place on the car, essentially balancing
the entire rotating mass, instead of just the wheel/tire combo. if you 
didn't put
the wheel back on the hub in exactly the same position as it came off

I agree with you on PartsHeaven.  I ordered a used AC hose from Robert

insulation than the one in my car and a good bit of grit in it.  I told
Robert and he said he'd take care of it.  I expected him to call back and
give me a price or something, but was surprised by a package arriving with
another hose a couple days later.  I called him to get a return number or
something to send the other one back and he said don't worry about it,
just keep it.  Now I am thankful each time I drive home in the sweltering
sun and swelter no more.  Oh, and when you order, ask him to send it in a
Domino's pizza box like the one my first delivery came in!  My neighbors
were having a party and saw me walking in with the pizza box.  Boy were

Pete,
  You should know, an auto-x, and a slow one, has little to do with the 
car, and way more to do with the driver, as I posted earlier I creamed 
all the cars with wider tires, but if I were driving those 993's and RS 
Americas, I would have creamed my own car I'm sure.

Now some of the instructor times were a few seconds lower than mine, so I 
do have some improvement to gain.  Incidentally, my instructor on the 
fast course did slower than me in my car, but he was not not used to the 
911 lift throttle understeer bit, but he got the car in position and knew 
when to brake in the sweep and hit the apex closer than I.  Still slower 
time though.

Hi everyone. Just ran the NE SCCA Divisional Solo-II and got some new info (I
won ASP, but not much competition). 

Next year it looks like the RX-7 Twin Turbo will move to SS with the Vettes,
and the MR-2 Turbo and 944 Turbo-S will move from B to A to join the 911. The
Mazda has been running similar times to the Vettes since they were
introduced. This is not new info.

The SCCA is also considering dropping the '94 ride-height rule which states
"adjustments which primarily change ride height are illegal". This rule
singles out Porsches and some Hondas with torsion bars. 
Also some 924/944/928s have adjustable coil spring perches which come under
this rule. Other suspension adjustments (Camber, caster, toe, etc) are
adjustable within the range of adjustment to any desired settings. The
current car classifications were based on years of results with Porsches
running at lowered ride height. Now we are supposed to raise them and run in
the same classes.

Please write the Solo Event Board ASAP if you ever want to run your Porsche
in a Stock class. If we get a few letters, I think they will remove this
rule. Write to :

Interesting idea, splitting porschephiles into smaller SIGs. I find

but the idea IS worth considering. What do other P-philes think of the

Subject: 911 Home Alignment (Mike Piera)

Robert Albrecht albrecht@nosc.mil Wants to adjust rear camber on his 911
to a more negative setting without changing toe, to decrease oversteer in
autocrossing.

If you adjust the rear camber more negative, you will need to pull the
wheel forward with the toe adjusting bolt to toe it back in.
I have found that there is a simple and pretty accurate way to do this
with only a tape measure. There are plenty of home alignment methods- here
is my personal method which has been proven effective on the autocross
course.

Before adjusting anything, support the car on jack stands and make sure
that both rear suspension arms are at full droop. Then measure from the
center
point of the torsion bar cover, to the hub of the rear brake (to the
closest point on the hub). Both sides of the car (left and right) should
measure about the same if your wheels are aligned correctly. Now you can
loosen the two 19mm bolts at the rear of the spring plate, and the two 19mm
eccentric (cam) bolts. Turn the rear-most bolt to adjust camber more
negative.
Then pull the wheel forward a bit with the forward eccentric bolt to get the
same toe measurement as before.

You can measure the camber accurately and easily with a good bubble level.
After driving the car to settle the suspension, check the distance the top
of the level is away from the top of the wheel, when the bottom of the
level is touching the bottom of the wheel (make sure the car is on very
level ground!). Don't measure from the tire, as it is very distorted.
You will probably have to fabricate something that you can hold the bubble
level against, that will fit against the wheel without hitting the tire.

Use some math : camber = inverse sin (measured distance / vertical length).
Vertical Length is usually about 1" more than wheel diameter, so 9/32" at the
top of a 15" wheel is about one degree negative. I run about 9/16 (2 degrees
negative) at the front and 3/4" (2.5 degrees) at the rear for autocrossing.
For the street this will wear out the insides of the tires quickly, so you
should try for about 1 to 1.5 degrees negative in the rear, and 1/2 degree
less
negative in the front (more if you're serious about handling).

- ---- snip -----
          I know I should just pay $ and have it done right, but
assuming it's out of adjustment anyway, I'd rather fiddle with it
myself and learn something along the way before paying someone to
set it right.
- ---- snip -----

Don't think that when you pay $$ to get it done that it will be better
than doing it yourself. I've heard plenty of horror stories about alignment
shops with equipment that was uselessly out of calibration.
If you can DIY, you can check it occasionally and will always know it is
right.
Peter Gabriel says "If you want some control, you've got to keep it small-
DIY". There are also plenty of ways to measure the toe-in, maybe another
day...

Subject: Spped traps in Macon, GA; North East Coast; around St. Louis

It seems to me there always are radar traps mainly north and sometimes south of
Macon, GA. Near the East Coast, I had the distinct impression the traps were
set up very near state lines, from the US-Canada border south to at least
Virginia (this observation is a decade old, is it still practiced?)  To add to
Bart Chambers' comments on radar use around St. Louis.

I always thought there was A DISPROPORTIONATE LOT of radar use by cops around
St. Louis, in both Missouri and Illinois.  I have driven in other cities around
the country, and it seems our traffic cops are extra zealous.  I have seen them
set up the traps around the highways and commuter roads, almost everywhere
within a 30 mile radius. They also tend to like the  three to five days around
the end of the month (nooooo,  they are not  filling quotas...), and around the
beginning of the month (maybe got  a short extension to fill last month's
quota?). This doesn't mean one  can "relax" vigilance the rest of the month.  
Taxpayers have refused tax increases to numerous local municipalities the last 
2-3 years, and it appears they have decided to enhance revenue in other ways...

They use instant-on mostly, and sometimes aircraft (a friend informs me he has
seen them use  laser on I-70 north of downtown). I can not give specific places
because I have seen them all over the place at different times. I have been
stopped for doing 61 mph on I-40 in a 55 mph  zone when everyone else around me
was doing over 65. On the other hand,  every single time I have been ticketed,
the officers have always been polite. Big Brother seems to be at work, because
without me giving any hints about my place of employment, they take my licence,
(which only lists first and last name, home address and a code number, not my
SSN) to check on their computers, and then they come back full of smiles,
comments about Washington University, and "hey, slow down a bit, doc" or "prof" 
and friendly comments to that effect. There is no other hint of that info on
the car, they can only be picking it from their computers.

I use a radar detector daily, and cat-and-mouse driving tactics (it's too
boring to drive the 911 at constant speed and in the same lane). But I have
learnt the hard way that if I forget the detector, the P-cars can only be
driven at or below the posted limit. With the silver-polar colored Jetta (this
color looks like a faded version of Porsche's champaign metallic), silver van,
and various rented US-made couch mobiles it's ok up to 80 mph. My statistics
indicate a pattern of discrimination here, so I have also decided that the
tickets I pay are additional taxation for driving the P-car.  I will ask my
accountant if I can deduct them as state tax from the federal income tax forms? 
Yeah, keep dreaming...

Hi all,
I'm looking for a part number cross reference for Bosch and Porsche
Fuel pump part numbers.
Specifically, I have a 77 1/2 Martini Ed. 924 and have a fuel
pressure leak-down.  This causes the infamous hot start problem.
The fuel pump works fine, but appears the back-pressure valve
isn't.  Porsche does not sell the valve rebuild kit.  Hoping
Bosch might.  Also have a line on Purolator equivalents to Bosch

Subject: Radar Absorbing materials

I saw an ad in Excellence for the "Cabrella" , a radar
absorbing car bra for a 911. Sounded interesting.   

Don't know if the product really works or not. Anyone 
tried it? There must be a few professionals out here
who can actually test it -- if not, I could probably
get it done here, but I don't want to buy oiine to find out.

This would only protect part of the front. The problem is there
is still lots of metal for the radar to bounce off of.

A much better idea was a passive jammer someone at NASA/JPL
was telling me about. You take a radar feed horn, mount it 
on the front as a hood ornament. In the back, put a aluminum fan.
The air blows through and turns the tiny fan. 

When radar is used at your front, all the radar that goes into
the feedhorn is reflected, except it is modulated by the frequency
of the fans. 

Because sin(ft)*sin(gt)= const * sin((f+g)t) + const * sin((f-g) t),
modulating the radar and reflecting it produces a signal at lots of 
different adjacent frequencies coming back at the police. If you modulated
it with a sine wave, youd just get two, but the fan at the back of the 
feed horn is much messier than that (more like a delta function). 

If the police
radar uses doppler radar, then this means the radar looks for a return
signal on an adjacent frequency and uses this to measure your speed. If
you overwhelm it with a return signal, on an adjacent frequency, that reads
a silly speed (which is what , hopefully, this gadget does) then
either they will point the radar somewhere else or try to get you from
the rear.

If the radar uses pulse transit time, you are still screwed, because
the travel time of the pulses will be the same. In fact, you will
have made it easier for them by increasing the return signal.

Any other ideas, or products tried? In this day of stealth bombers,
seems like we could get some sort of anti-radar device for our cars.

Subject: SCCA Ride Height Rule

Well, my response is even later, Mike.

I, too, am intimately familiar with this rule.  I've spent hours
trying to reverse it -- even going to my SCCA National BoD member
and getting him to ask about it at a Board Meeting. 

Bottom line: the SEB was concerned that stock 914s were "lower"
in front than Street Prepared 914s and ANY lowering to add camber
is illegal (i.e., don't even try to make the argument that your
"primary" purpose in making the adjustment was in order to add
camber rather than to lower the car because the SEB apparently
believes they are one and the same).

Rally/Solo Manager Howard Duncan saw Steve Compton's 914 set at
the stock ride height with its kooky appearance and according to
Steve immediately took the position that "this wasn't what the
rule clarification intended."  Howard has allowed Steve to lower
his car from the "stock" height by 20 mm -- that let's Steve get
..3 degrees negative camber.  (At the "stock" height I get
positive camber.)  Steve has been competing in the car in Pro
Solo and has been reasonably competitive vis a vis the Miatas,
but not doing as well as last year with more camber.

Howard agreed to attempt to get the SEB to adopt the 20 mm
deviance from "stock" ride height as reasonable.  I wrote a
letter to the SEB saying that the 20mm deviation would appear to
help the 2.0 liter 914's but that I wasn't sure it would be good
enough for my 1.8 liter, which already has trouble in D Stock
with the Hondas' horsepower and is competitive only on certain
types of courses.  I urged them to instead drop the rule
altogether.  

Apparently last month the SEB finally discussed the matter.  The
results of that discussion was supposed to have been in SportsCar
for member comment.  But it wasn't -- according to Steve
Compton's conversation with Colan Arnold (SEB Chair), it was
dropped until next month becasue SportsCar needed the room for
the proposed Prepared rules re-write -- and it will instead be
there next month.  All this means that the 20mm deviation is not
usable at Salina for the National Championships (although Howard
is still permitting it in Pro Solo) this year.

The preliminary word is that as many of three options are being
discussed by the SEB.  One would adopt the 20 mm deviation. 
Another would kill the rule altogether.  The third would move the
2.0 liter to A Stock and the 1.8/1.7 liter to C Stock!

Please, please, take the time to write letters to the SEB and
help end this nonsense.   Getting letters with comments in
writing is the only input that will be considered.  I want to
drive my 914, in stock configuration, in SCCA competition and I
want all of you to be able to, too.

Hi Kyle,

 Glad to be of help.

  Ooh, sounds like experience here.

So, is Stan right?  Does even the dashboard have to come out?  What can I 
leave on the car?  What about mounting points?

  Depends on how far you think you need to go with the car.
  How bad is it?  explain what you intend..tell me what you see.

  Ok, my rotisserie was built on the car in the garage (in situ?).
  I only needed to remove the engine/trans, and two bolts at the
front of the car (front suspension mount points one per).  I had to
drill two 1/2" holes in the footwells at the 'donuts' on the under
side of the car.  My rotisserie is hand-made, one piece, and bolts
onto the car at 8 points.  This was not difficult in comparison to
the actual restoration work, and is an excellent place to begin
your welding experience.  (i was *very* new at it all)

  I am still in process (but have not worked on the car in nearly
a year) of a total ground-up on a '73.  I could give you reams of
experience good and bad.

Here was my plan.....I haven't even seen a rotisserie up close...just the odd 
picture in a magazine.  I was thinking about buying a couple of domestic V8 
engine stands (750+ pound capacity) and welding an adjustable bar on each.  
These bars would have short bars sticking out which would bolt onto the 
factory bumper mounting holes.  I have a '75 so I'd use the plates where the 
bumper shocks would mount to.  When the car is on the thing, it could spin 
around freely and roll around the garage if need be.

Would this work?  Would I have to reinforce the bumper mounting areas?

  That just might work since the '75 and later years had structural
members for mounting the bumper shocks.  It depends on the condition
of the body around these four critical points.  As for the 
flexibility of rolling the entire rig around the shop, the casters
on those stands are a bit tiny and perhaps hard to roll, but you 
have a great idea.  If you go this route, get the stands that have 
four casters, not three. (four give greater stability).  Many times
the 'neck' on these stands is canted, so 360'rotation will not be
possible.  I looked long and hard at this when designing mine..that
is why I just welded up simple stanchions having *wide* stance, 
with hitch balls.  Some thought must also be given to holding
the rig in spacial rigidity..you wouldnt want the thing to come
apart and fall.  You really dont want to mash the car some point
into the work after all that effort.

  There is another hazard to keep in mind; height.  To be able to
rotate the body you will have to suspend the rig 1 meter or <so.
  At that height there will be top-heaviness and that is cause
for concern both in maneuvering the mass and in just getting the
car/rotisserie up to mounting height.  How would you lift this to
the required height when most jacks poop out far short.  And when
you do get it up, will it tip over because the feet are too narrow.
  beware.
  I now use an engine hoist to do this thru a single point lift.


If the trunks are bad
or the longitudinals are bad, you might cause the car to fold.
  Totally stripped a 914 body weighs in around 750 lbs (a guess)
hanging that weight across the span is a sure way to invite a
disaster when you cut and patch the body in critical structural 
areas.  It happened to me and i was using a full-length rig.

  My rotisserie spans the entire length of the car and uses around
80 feet of 2" square 16ga. steel tube.  At each end is a stanchion
made of more tube with a steel plate welded at the top, to this
a trailer hitch ball mounted horizontal (1 7/8") that mates to a
heavy wall steel pipe (2" id) that is securely held in another pair
of plates that are mounted to the tube frame.  The tubes are bent
90' fore and aft of the body and the plate pairs are bolted in place.
  I chose bolts so the center of gravity of the rig can be adjusted
by moving the plates up or down as you remove/add parts, this worked
very well.  The presence of the steel rig only mildly affected the
access of various parts of the car.

  The bearing pipe is double walled into the plates at each end of 
the car.  This allows the whole jig to roll 360' and in case of 
failure the stanchions are next in line to bear the weight.
  I think i spent about $400 in new steel and 3 months to make it.

  When i replaced the longitudinals (sheet metal frame members)
I added a 2 inch wide 1/2" thick bar of steel to the floorpan across
the span.  I did the work with the doors off and the body sagged
enough that now the doors wont close, so i'm in for a trip to the
bodyshop for a stretch of the imagination..beware.


 For a small investment of a SASE, I will *loan* you photos of the
rig.   7323 East Gilbert, Wichita  Kansas   67207.

After observing the melted remains of my K&N air filter on the back side

there have been problems in the past few months (mine was purchased 4/94) 
with their manufacturing plant in England.  So far, 5 incidents of this 
'meltdown' have been reported.  It is caused by an error in the mixture 
of the compound used for the gasket. 

They requested I send it back, and they'll send me a non-melting version 
when the factory finishes the new batch (est. 60 days).  In addition, if 
I have a receipt for one of the standard paper filters, they will reimburse 
me for that as well :).

No one at Performance Products (where I bought it) would admit to a problem, 
but offered to send me another one as a replacement (no thanks, I'll wait for
the new batch), or give me a refund.

Greetings all.
  <curse filter at max., pun filter at max.>

  I see this reference to penises on occasion.  Usually accompanied
by words like 'envy' and 'size' in response to some flammables.

  um, I'm reluctant to say this, but having a large penis is not that
much fun.  (dont ask how i know)  Why someone would envy such is a sign
of someone who has no idea and is possibly under-endowed. 

  Ask a women of apparent over-endowment if she's envious of other
women's overly large breasts and she might insult you, if she dont
clothesline you first.  the answer is *no*. (dont ask how i know)

  One has to remember that for an appendage that has its finest hour
only a few percent of the total time in one's life, there is much ado
about the human condition and suffering here!  Ditto for females!

  It goes with the territory.  Somehow I knew y'all would understand.

I'm sure this subject has been discussed before, but after fixing *almost* all

seatbelt light (not sure if its worth the trouble).  But it would be nice
to have the clock working.  The clock I have is the late style Quartz clock
which the previous owner of my '73 purchased about 4 months prior to my
purchasing the car.  He paid $200 for it and behold...it doesn't work.
I hooked it up to the 12v circuit for the glove compartment light, since
the wire which was originally connected to its 12v terminal had no juice.
I thought it would work, but it didn't.

My question:  What is the main problem with these clocks?  How come every 911
              I've seen, almost, has a non-functioning clock?

              Do I have to pay up the nose to get it fixed or can I attempt
              the fix myself without screwing up the clock even more?

Subject: vibration conclusion


Had the vibration checked out.  I'm told its very minor and probably 
caused by one of two things: a) a slight imbalance on one of the tires or 
b) its so minor, could simply be that because one or both front wheels 
did not go back on the exact lugs, could be slight imbalance there.  
Rotors ok.  Tranny ok (by the way it happens in 5th gear too, but at 
slightly higher speed).  So, I'm relaxed again.

Thanks again to the philers who helped out.

Although you 911 guys may not like it, I'd like to have the 914 list combined 
with the 911s or by itself - not combined with 356s and 912s.  My 914/6 is 
almost more 911 than 914.  Many people like to upgrade their 914 parts with 
911 parts (brakes, wheels, engines, trannys, etc).  Seems natural to me - a 
lot more natural than combined with 356s and 912s.

Subject: 911 gearbox and electronics questions

I have a couple of items I'd appreciate a bit of wisdom on.  The car is my
'83 911 Cabriolet.

1)What is 'typical' for a 911 gearbox?  I've not been able to get the car into
  first without a complete stop (or VERY nearly so) for some time.  I've
  been told that 911 gear boxes are prone to this.  What should I expect 
  if I have the box re-built?  Downshifts into first at 30 with
  no problem, or will it be the same as now?  What 'upgrades' are available
  or worth doing when one is inside the gearbox?  Is limited slip an
  installable option, or does it require a replacement of the transaxle?  Is
  it worth it for a (up until now) street only car?  I've heard that newer
  gearboxes are up to much more punishment without complaint.  Is this just
  new synchros, or is it more than that?

2)What about engine control electronics?  Is it advisable to upgrade the car
  to a Motronic system?  Is it so involved as to be ridiculously expensive/
  worthless?  Would I be better off spending money on other things?  I've seen
  some performance figures for the new control boxes used on the '94
  corvette, including sequential fuel injection.  They look impressive for
  accelleration, driveability and economy.  Does Porsche have this feature
  in the new control boxes?

Thanks

> Interesting idea, splitting porschephiles into smaller SIGs. 

Yeah, but not *THAT* interesting. There is a problem in doing this,
mainly having to do with two items 

(1) technology -- how do you make sure that you don't miss info that's
mis-labeled or mis-psoted? The big problem with Use(less)net is that
you have all these subgroups and no one pays any attention to "binning"
i.e. making sure stuff goes to the right place (well, OK -- the real problme 
is that anyone that wants to participate *CAN* which drives signal to noise
below usable). 

(2) resources. When doing this starts paying money I can take time off
to make it better. Right now, that's not possible. I've got a consulting
group that takes tim (and PAYS for it!), a software company in NJ that I'm 
trying to sell, and a new business that I'm trying to get off the ground.

I barely have time to keep the list going, chastise the misbehaving, post
the tidbits of info I happen to know, and purge the unworthy. There are 
just no cycles for the added work at this point. Maybe when I'm down 
to just having two companies and a racing team...

never satisfy with the fit and finish.  If you stand far away from the car,
it kit looks real good.  You get close the car it looks like pieces have been

Does anyone know what happened to Mitcom? I've tried calling them, but to no

my celica.  Does anyone know where in the Bay Area I can get these parts?

Oh, that's pretty typical.... The synchros in 915 transmissiosn seem to 
last about 30K miles if you're lucky. So even if you get it rebuilt,
it's gonna go back to just like it is now "soon".  You can "bump" the
shifter into the 3rd gear detent as you shift into 1st and make some of
the gear grinding go away, BTW.

There *IS* a place called Racing Force that uses hand-fit stainless steel
synchros that just don't wear out, but you should not use them unless
you're builting a real racing box -- all that wear has to go *SOMEWHERE*
and it gets transferred into what are now the softer parts, like the
mainshaft and the gears... So instead of losing the synchros at 30k miles,
you lose the intermediate plate or something similar.

Limited slip and a 7:31 ring and pinion are both installable options if you're
getting the transmission rebuilt. Factory LSDs - which are clutch based,
BTW -- wear out, though, so you get to do it again and again. Rather than 
using one, get a Quaiffe, which is the Gleason Torsen style unit that just 
never wears out. The 7:31 will give you *TONS* better acceleration, but
don't wear as well as the 8:31 you have now. Hard to say if or when it's
likely to break, though.

The best way to do that "upgrade" is by swapping in a good used 3.2 engine
with all the DME stuff. Figure on spending $3500-6000 for the engine, and
another $1-2k for the install. You can ask Elmer about that -- he has two
that he's doing right now.

If you just want to upgrade the FI, you'd better start asking *WHY*. Sure,
you can do it -- redoing your CIS for more power would be in the $1-2k
range, putting on a *GOOD* programmable digitial pulsed system is nearly
a $10k option *AND* wiht Houston under EPA interdiction, you'd not be able
to register your car for the street in two years, unless the TX DPS gets
its head out and starts allowing CARB approved systems... BTW, you don't
have that problem if you go to the later engine with the DME, but there
are other "paperwork problems" that show up when your engine doesn't
match the serial number range or picture of what its supposed to look like...

If you are going to track days at SIR, then you must live around
Seattle.  Go to Puget Sound Tire and talk to greg Fordal.  He is the
only person I would let touch suspension parts.  Colon will probaly do
the work, but you can trust him also.  Koni's are probaly the best,
stay away from KYB's for I have heard nothing good about them.

As for the 944T's off at SIR.  As I understand it the flip was caused
by lifting and then breaking into turn one.  The car also had
different tires front and back.  It must be understood that turn one
is flatout without lifting.  Any movement to upset the car will result
in problems.  As for the car last I heard it was being sold for

With the exception of wiper arms and blades, nothing

several forms before '74 but now only black grills can be purchased as

Porschephiles,

I have a few questions:

1. Does anybody on the list have a 1974 or 75 911 Carrera? I would like to
   talk to someone who knows things specific to these somewhat rare cars.

2. My driver's side window has fallen out of the window regulator. Apparently,
   whatever adhesive the factory used to glue the window into the regulator
   groove has aged and let go. I'm thinking of using a strong epoxy like PC7 to
   glue it back in. Is this the best choice?

3. How do you read the date codes stamped on some Porsche parts? My door pocket

allows you to select articles to read without being bothered about the rest.

With mail, read the ones you want, then do a "rm /usr/spool/mail/username"
and the rest of your mail (INCLUDING NON PORSCHE MAIL) will go away. 

This command may be different on different computers.

Subject: 944 - What is this thing?

All:

I just picked up my '85.5 944 and really love it.  But like
any new owner, I have some questions. 

Just right of the cigarette lighter is a small, grilled opening
in the dash. When I turn on the electrics via the ignition key, I
can hear an electric motor-like sound from the area of this
opening.  What is this thing?  And is it related to the motor
sound I'm hearing?  I'm concerned that the motor I hear shouldn't
be running constantly as it is when I turn on the electrics.

Thanks!  Waiting for my Haynes manual to arrive is irritating!

Subject: K&N Filters and Hydrolock


Hello All;

The recent comments about K&N filter recalls leads me to another question.  
During the recent pre-purchase inspection on my '89 951 I asked the mechanic 
about installing a K&N filter to replace the paper filter.  The mechanic 
recommended AGAINST installing the K&N filter.  His justification was that the 
K&N filters have the tendency to pass water through the filter.  This could 
lead to HYDROLOCK in the engine because water is not a compressible fluid.

Is the mechanic correct about K&N filters?  It sounds like many p-filers use 
them, so I will assume the majority have not experienced this problem.  Also, 
do the K&N filters give that much of a performance boost to be worth the 
possible consequences?

Note that this phenomonon is particlular to 944s because of the location of the 
air intake inside the left front fender.  Any comments on this subject would be 
appreciated before I do something potentially harmful to my 'new' car.  Thanks 
in advance.

Subject: Carrera shifting difficulty

My '85 Carrera coupe is giving me some difficulty in gears 1 & 2
and I was hoping to solict some advice from people.

The car has some serious miles...145,000. The engine is in perfect
condition and maintained fanatically well. I bought the car 2 years
ago at 100K miles and didn't have a whole lot of trouble shifting.
Now days, first and second gear are not always easy to get into.
Particularly, second gear is a struggle and is more difficult at
the higher rpm's. At times, I have to pull so hard to get it into
second that I sometimes will give up and just skip second and go 
right into third. 

Question: Are there any adjustments that can be done or is this 
going to be a serious outlay of cash and parts to solve?

I'm willing to throw no more than $1000 on the problem and if it's
more I will probably sell and upgrade to an '87.

Also, my clutch seems very heavy. Considerable more than my prior
'72 911T. Any suggestions?

Thanks much for help.

Hi, Alan.
 
I can't identify the grease specified for your sunroof, but Golde is most
likely the sunroof manufacturer (Golde made sunroofs for Porsche since the
early 356 days). So the Golde grease, whatever it may be, is just something
that the supplier to Porsche recommends, and you're never going to find it
anywhere over here. As I recall, the factory grease that was visible on the
911 sunroof mechanism looked like ordinary everyday white lithium grease.

As a 912 owner, I find that most all my inquiries are responded

	1.  Non-Specific stuff (the radar detectors, flames, etc.)
	2.  Air Cooled (356, 911, 912, 914)
	3.  Water Cooled

I dont see that much 356/912 mail to warrant a separate
category and I also dont seem to read alot about restoration. 
Actually, if we could rid ourselves of all the "crap mail" that
seems to have exploded into high volume mail during the last year,
we wouldnt even have to split it up - but, given its continuous flow,
maybe that's not possible.  No offense to those who joined within

Actually, glass is a good electromagnetic reflector as well (haven't

generally low radar profile to begin with, but the radar absorbing bra
should certainly help.  You just have a hard time driving it when you

I have had an idea for a long time, but I have never really thought to try
it.  WARNING, the following would be ILLEGAL if anyone actually built
and used this device!

A radar detector, and a fast signal processor, along with a cpu for doing the 
thinking, and an accurate speedometer (sonic?).
1)Detector senses radar.
2)DSP figures out exact type, frequency, pulse rate, etc.
3)Processor takes input radar parameters, and true speed, computes the
  appropriate phase shift, frequency shift, and alternate frequencies, and
  controls a microwave generator to do one of the following:
  a)exactly cancel the received signal by transmitting out of phase energy
    back
  b)calculate the correct shifts and broadcast back a legal speed
  c)determine exact direction the radar is coming from, and launch a small
    tactical warhead with a radar homer (be sure you have shut off your
    own transmitter before launching!!)

In general this is all do-able, but I haven't looked into the calculation
times, versus the lock-on lag times to see if it could be realised.  It is
certainly trivial for doppler, but some more thought would have to be given to 
the pulse and side frequency return units.

Subject: Agressive driving

(note this is cross posted to miata and porsche lists....)

First some background:

Ok, I admit it.  I drive agressively.  Sometimes too agressivly if you ask my
wife.  My daily commute is ~25 miles of hilly backroads.  I've driven the
route probably 500 times in all sorts of weather.  I know exactly how fast my
Miata and 911 can take each curve, and infact I rarely use the breaks if I am
not following another car I just slow down enough for the next turn (if
necessary).

My Miata is fairly modified; dynos at 155 hp now, I can lap Portland Int'l
Speedway in about 1:20 consistently (Indy cars are about 1:08, HP bugeyes
about 1:36, SSC stock Miatas about 1:29) this is faster than most of the
RX7's and 944T's there; they pull me on the straight, I pass them in turn 3
and pull away through 6, and can usually hold them off on the back straight 
and stay in front of them in 7 through 10.  Even though I have never driven a
944, I think I am pretty familiar with its handling and power capabilities.

Now the situation:

Last friday I was driving home, it was earlier than I usually leave work, and
the traffic was very light.  About midpoint in my commute, just as the twisty
section really gets fun, I see a Dumptruck followed by an '86 or '87 944 turn
left onto the road I will be taking as well.  I notice that the 944 is
lowered a couple of inches, and has a license plate "FLY GUY" so I think
'alright, this Porsche is gonna pass the dumptrunck then I can pass the truck
and we can have some fun on this great road.'  There are a pair of turns that
I know I can take at about 65, but are posted as 25's.  The (full) dumptruck
takes them at 35.  The Porsche slows to 25.   Hmmmmm.  I notice that the 944
has two twenty something guys in it, maybe they are talking and not paying
attention.   After the turn is a nice long straight, broken yellow, perfect
opportunity to pass, the Porsche does nothing; I start to reel in the gap,
thinking maybe I'll just pass both of them, but then as I get close enough, a
herd of cattle--err a bunch of commuters coming the other way.  We start
into the rise and fall of a number of hills, if the truck/porsche were going
5 mph slower, I'd have time to pass, but I'll just stay put since the
visibility is not too good through a mountian.  Now I'm not exactly 2 seconds
behind the Porsche, but I'm further from him than he is from the truck.

The passenger is playing airplane wing with his hand out the window at this
point.  I notice that the 944 seems to have very little travel on the rises
and falls, it probably handles pretty close to my Miata, I think it would be
a good match.  I continue to putter along in mild frustration, silently
coaxing the Porsche pilot to pass the dumptruck already.

We come up on the tight left hander, a 15 mph posted turn, I've taken it at
50+ mph many times no problem.  The dumptruck is going to take the turn at
30.  The Porsche stops.  Completely.  Right in the middle of the turn.

The driver leans out his window, and shouts back at me, "Get the hell out of
my ass F***h**d.  Get your piece of s#!+ off the road!  Or I'll do it for
you!" 

I ignore him.  He then accelerates (slowly and with quite a few lunges) and
breaks a few more times trying to get me to rearend him or something.  One
time he breaks really hard and I try to pass on the left (there's a broken
yellow here, plenty of room too) but he swerves to cut me off.  Now I'm
ticked.

I watch the dumptruck take the same turn I will be taking; a great 3 mile
section of perfectly banked turns, my favorite part of the commute.  Great.
The porsche follows suit.  wunnderful.  He continues to show his pecker size
by swerving into the on coming lane at random times, even though I have made
no attempts to pass.  Eventually our little trio comes up on a really slow
pickup truck pulling a four horse trailer.  The distances close, and we come
up on a straight.  I accellerate and pass all three cars, getting a wave from
the truck driver and dumptruck and a couple of single fingers and hand
gestures from Mr. Fly Guy.

OK.  You still here?

A couple of thoughts:

His precious german motor car is currently worth about $7500 in good
condition.  My Miata is worth about $10500 plus the $6500 in aftermarket
stuff I have.  So my piece of s#!+ is worth about 2 times his engineering
marvel.

The 944 and Miata are classified in the same class in Solo II autox. 

I know from practical experience that my Miata turns lap times as fast or
faster than most 944's at PIR.  So the cars probably handle equally well, but
I would bet that the modified Miata would win (witness recent R&T skidpad of
.913 for 993, .976 for slightly modified Miata.  I've seen 1.2 on a G-analyst
in my car.)

The 944 has 147 hp, my Miata has 155.   It also weighs much less, I bet I'm
quicker.

So, it looks like my Miata is worth more, faster, handles better, and is
quicker than Mr. Fly Guy's 944, or at least would give him a good run for the
money.  Yet instead of enjoying a nice twisty road with a fellow sports car
enthusiast, he decided to be a jerk and try to ruin my fun.

I bet he wouldn't have said anything or done anything if I was driving the
911.

Also he would have been right calling the yellow monza a POS.  But I would
have really blown his doors off during one of the straights.  340+ hp and 
450+ torque in a 3000 pound car is great for straight line acceleration, but
it is weak in the handling department.

Anyway, what is wrong with people?  Why do they get so high and mighty about
not letting others traveling faster than them get past?

This morning a similar thing happened, a Bronco II was following a new
Eclipse, fairly close but he was about to pass her.  Suddenly she slammed on
the brakes hard enough that the Ford locked up.  I passed them both at that
point to avoid further shenanigans and she gave me the single digit.

What's her problem.  Sheesh.

	I think '74 SE but I'm biased. Actually there isn't much difference
between '73 and '74. You do want the appearance group if you don't get the SE.
It gets you gauges, center console, and sway bars that you can replace with
good ones without fabricating mounts.

	I paid $1500 for a super clean '74 with a non-running engine 6 years ago, 
I think that was a pretty good deal. I also paid $2000 for a '70 factory 6 with
a lunched motor, that didn't turn out to be too good a deal as it still needs a lot
of work (besides the motor). Someday I may even get to drive it !

	'74 Special Edition with gauges, nice Mahle wheels, Sway bars, and
obnoxious colors. Also, funky a front air dam which hits the ground on every
driveway and speed bump. (mine hangs in the garage, a flexdam is on the car).

>

	Depends on which stock rims are used. I have 195/50-vr15's on my
Mahle alloys for the street. Doesn't look like much room to go bigger. I have
205/50's on panaracer alloys for track use, but they have a different backspacing.
I don't know (or care) about tall tires.

	Ain't gonna happen. A 914/4 will sound like a big-bore bug.
Most headers are too big for a stock motor and will cost you driveability.
If you have a modified motor, there are a few good headers availiable, but
it still sounds like a big bore bug. Factory manifolds and an ANSA extractor
work great for the street.

I have such a box which is getting a quaife as we speak.  The former
owner installed a taller 4th and 5th (euro carrera).   Being that I
have tons of torque I would rather have an 8:31 with stock gears or a
7:31 with stock (83sc) gears.  As a result 2nd is mostly useless for
the track so I'm back to a 3 speed.

Gene apparently wanted to pererve highway driveability and consequently
put in the taller 4th and 5th.  Not the way I'd go though.

Now I have a trans which I dumped roughly $1700 into *quaife, rebiuild,
a couple of bearings and all synchros)

One thing to mention about the 7:31 - mine is wearing PERFECTLY after
roughly 50K miles, but this is a function of getting the R&P set up
correctly.  To fdo so a good rebuilder can read the specs from your old
pinion shaft and setup the new one with the appropriate number of shims
for pinion depth.  If this is not done the new R&P will be toast in a
thousand miles or so.

Hi, Cherie.
 
I think there was a similar thread several months ago. The screw extractor
things are sort of a last resort, they fail as often as
they work. The surefire way to get it out, cleanly and safely without
destroying the threads, is to have somebody with an electrical discharge
mill destroy the broken screw. The cost is nominal, figure maybe $20 (think
about how much aggravation you're having already, and for $20 these guys
will do this as a routine job). The problem is you have to get the car or
part to them.
 
Look in the commercial phone book under electrical discharge machining, or
ask a local machine shop where they take their problems.

Hi Chuck,

I know you've seen Stan's reply to your tranny post by now.  Let me add that 
I've had the exact same problem since I bought my lil red toy at 10,700 miles.

I've also had it *crunch* on fast shifts into 2nd near the red-line.  I've 
written PCNA about this since the problem was happening while the car was under 
the 1-yr factory Used car warranty, and put them on notice that the faulty 
syncros *are* causing Tranny damage, and that I will expect them to fix it when 
it becomes necessary.

BTW, following Stan's (good) advice, and also double-clutching on the 1-2 shift 
as well, I've avoided these problems for a while.

My letter had some results, as PCNA had Steve Rielly, PCNA District Rep, call me
on 7/21. He guaranteed me that PCNA  will *at least* split the cost of tearing 
the tranny down to see what, if any damage, is occuring.  He also added that if 
the clutch is dragging, then that would cause the problem and the warranty will 
not cover that.  When we left it, he was going to call Tisher and get a quote 
for the labor and get back to me.  I'm still waiting to hear from Steve.

Subject: Re: 944 - Oil Leak Help

Tom,

This approximate area usually gets covered in power steering fluid,
because the rigid metal clamps at the base of the reservoir don't do
a very good job.  Replace them with garden-variety "zebra" hose clamps,
and that will largely cure the problem.  Porsche recommended this in
a tech bulletin.  There is also a clamp on the feed line to the
power steering pump, fastening it to a banjo bolt.  It too leaks and
should be tightened or replaced.

Another possibility is the oil pressure sender.  And it might come
from a cam or a balance shaft seal.  The radial oil seals get tired.
On the eight-valve cars, the cam has a metal spacer ("slinger") on
which the oil seal rides.  The seal can wear a groove in it, and this
will exacerbate the leaking.

I would clean the area throughly with your favourite product (for
example, Simple Green), then run the engine and pin-point the leak
source.

My old Audi, 'brown bomber', *ATE* two sets of Japanese shock absorber in a 
two year periode, then the beast got Monroes; lasted even shorter. I decided 
to go for Bilstein (....maybe it was Yellow Koni's?(10 years ago!)). 
The problem was gone, at least until I rolled the car some years later.

Afterwards I learnt I should have changed the front springs as these might 
be the problem to the 'shock-eating' Audi.
But for a while at least it was a nice 'test-bed' for shock absorbers....... :-|

The Bilsteins outlasted the others......!

I've also used Yellow Bilsteins in various Alfa Roemo's, my experience with 
them is very positive. Never had to change an absorber!

Subject: 911 amateurs - thats me folks

In my never ending quest to keep my garage floor free from oil I have been
chasing a few little leaks from my 911 Turbo (thanks for responses to for
previous request for help on this subject). While under the machine I noticed 
that the oil pipe from the oil tank to the engine (short and inexpensive -
comparatively) was perished at the joint to the engine. Time to replace it.

Having got the part out cames the oil, off with the old, on with the new
and in goes the oil. No problem. Fire it up check for leaks - none, check the
oil level - reasonable, warm it up and recheck the oil - fill it up, everything
fine right lets have fun.

Now the fun starts. On returning home I noticed a steady drip from the engine.
It turned out that the cork seal around the oil level sensor had failed 
presumably because it had been exposed to air for a short time while the oil
was out. So order a new one - very cheap. Jack the car right up to ease the
access and out with the sensor - funny no oil on it and its supposed to be
floating in oil. New gasket fitted, sensor back in off the jack. Lets check 
the oil level - how much did I loose?  OH MY GOD there no oil in it. Fill it up
a little (I cant have lost that much can I????????). Fire it up - great fear
check the level and slowly but surely the oil magically re-appears. What was
that Oh yes only check the oil when hot. Now what do you do when you
overfill with oil???

Overkill.  An aquaintance of mine made a jammer that worked and cost less
than $100 to build.  Most important item is a gun plexor horn of the type
that open supermarket doors (remember, these set off radar detectors).
You should be able to get one of these at a ham fest for about $15-50.
There is a screw setting in the back which somehow tunes the frequency.
Go to Rat Shack and buy a signal generator, they have a nice single chip
one which has a couple of settings including a sine wave and a "white
noise" generator.  I think you'll need an amp to drive the horn too.
Set the thing up on a pole with the sine wave/amp at an appropriate
frequency, put your car some distance away with your radar detector on.
Turn the tuning screw in the horn till your detector goes nuts, now
change the config of your driver circuit to white noise (the detector
should still be going bonkers).  Now open up your expensive radar detector
and patch into the wires that light the lamp or some other alarm, use
this to turn on and off the amp driving the gun horn.  We tested this
with a real police radar gun (and a real policeman) and it worked.  This
was 7 years ago though, not sure if technology has passed this by.  The
other option is a couple of rain gutter mounted passive homing HE rockets
with some sort of proximity fusing device, think that'll get you in trouble!

Is this "alleged"  fuel pressure/pump problem that's been on the net 
recently, contagious?

Funny thing happened on the way home from work yesterday in my 924...

Driving along at 45 MPH, my car quit running.  Period.  I coasted around a 
corner pulled over and stopped.  After some considerable cranking (i.e. warm 
engine, hard start) and pumping a strangely soft feeling accelerator, the 
car started and ran fine.  Drove home and back in to work again without 
trace of the problem.

I'm posting this because this problem was similar to the C4 posting 
recently.  Also I've had the other following 911, 944  reported symptons:
                                         1)  Hard starting when the engine 
is warm and had only been shut off for a few
                                               minutes.  Cold starting is 
never a problem.
                                         2)  Feeling like someone is 
applying the brakes when I'd reach 3000 RPM

Occurrences of the symptons have been random.  Had I not read of the other 
occurrences on the net, I'd be thinking this was just my imagination.  So, 
what next?  I'm at the mercy of my mechanic for getting the problem 
(assuming there really is one) fixed, so how should I approach him?  Fuel 
pressure check?

Awating your wisdom (and validating a single list for the marque),

Subject: 914 structural rust, inexpensive alloys

My progress on the car has been slow lately due to a 12X24 shed we 
constructed, I don't even get to use it as a garage!!!.  The wheel 
bearings are going on tonight.  I have some questions about how much rust 
is too much.
Under the battery mount (which is currently removed) there is some rust, 
shocking as that may be.  The firewall is rusted through in one spot 
about 1 square inch.  The bottom is only rusted through in a very small 
spot (1/4") in one corner, the rest is relatively sound.  I do not intend 
on doing a strip down restoration of this car in the near future.  I have 
some rust sealer (POR) to stop the progress of the rust, but do I NEED to 
repair the structural member there.  If so, is there a reasonable way to 
patch it up without rebuilding the whole rear corner of the car???  My  
current inclination is to patch up the firewall with either sheet metal 
and rivits or fiberglass then cover the hole in the bottom so no more 
water enters, and hope for the best, but if my swing arm mysteriously 
becomes a steering mechanism, I will be very sad :-(.  Any suggestions?

The second question concerns the rims.  I currently have the "styled" 
steel rims stock on '75s, boooring, but still rather functional.  They 
are a bit rusted and have a few chunks where it appears the previous 
owner contacted curbs along the way.  I would like to find some 
replacements that are in line with the value and quality of the car (see 
above!!)  Don't laugh, but I found some EMPI-like alloys in no less than 
J.C. Whitney  (yes I know there is no less), for about $55.00 a shot.  I 
know these are not quality wheels, but am I taking a step down from the 
steel rims with these????  If these are a Bad Idea, what can I do to 
spruce  up the steel rims?  As always any information is very welcome.  
Thanks again.

Subject: 911. Fuel system problems


Yesterday I was promised to get my car back from the workshop
after 6 weeks without my 911 (you might remember my moose report).

Was I disapointed!

The paint on the LH rear fender was exact match in color but had
a rough finish. Had to be corrected together with other remarks
on the paint. They had also dropped something on the from bumper
casing a crack in clearcoat.

They hadn't corrected the steering wheel after the wheel alignment,
was some 20 degrees wrong.

Worst of all was, however, that the car only ran on 5 cylinders. 
One fuel injector was jammed and had to be removed and cleaned -
which I have to pay for. Is this something which is common if the
car sits for a couple of weeks? It has not happended to me before
(the car is in the garage all winter).

I suspect that it is the new fuel that is causing the problem.
Lead was banned this year in Sweden and the replacement is some natrium 
stuff. The word on the street is that the new fuel can make valves etc to
stick.

One way of lubricate a fuel injection system is to have some two stroke
oil in the fuel now and then. I have not dared to try this but every second
fill up I add some special injection cleaner (STP).  I've seen 104+
being sold by Performance Products but I presume it is something similar
to the STP stuff. The problem is that it is so expensive. Has anyone
had similar fuel system problems? Any cheaper alternative than these
expensive injection cleaners?

Any experience or advice is appreciated.

Dustin, I wouldn't use anything that permanent. Go to an auto glass
specialist and buy whatever they use. You want something hard but it has to
be removable if you ever need to replace the glass. Otherwise you'll be
looking for a new channel too.
 
They use some sort of semitransparent goo, not silicone, to hold things like
sliding windows and turning vent windows in their hardware.

Subject: Re: SCCA Ride Height Rule

I could not agree more with the following statements.  Katie,  thank you for 
taking the time and effort to provide this information and your opinions on 
the subject of the SCCA Ride Height Rule.  As a 914 1.9L DS driver myself, 
and one who is trying hard to stay legal, I also care deeply about this subject.

I personally will be following yours and Mike Pirea's advice.  I am writing 
the SEB today!  Additionally, I would encourage all other interested parties 
to do the same, especially 914 drivers - right Trevor?  I support your 
recommendation of dropping the ride height rule altogether.  Not only is it 
difficult to enforce, or so I have been told, it takes away the right of a 
driver to use a given cars standard stock features.  BTW - does anyone know 
what model and year Hondas are effected by this?  (I drove an ES 90 Civic Si 
for two years.)

Regarding the possiblity of reclassing these cars:  How could anyone 
rationalize moving a 76 horsepower 914 into C-stock with 115+ hp Miata's? 
Let alone 2.0 914's into A-Stock!!  Where are the 914-6's going to be put? 
SS or EM <g>.  I don't think so.  At least in the Texas area, Miata's are 
traditionally 1 to 3 seconds faster than the 914's in DS.  (Reasonable 
drivers in all most all cases.)  

BTW Katie - You aren't kidding about 914's only being competitive on certain 
courses.  That fact has certainly proven itself here in the Houston Region 
and the greater Texas community.

*****CORRECTION****

I regret my response was incorrect. I mis-remebered the cut-off year
for chrome emblems. The engine script and PORSCHE script changed to
black with the 2.4 l 911s. My poast should have read "nothing was black
before 1972.

I won't be answering questions like this until I have a chance to go

Sorry for the misinformation

- ----- Begin Included Message ----- 

Can someone tell me if the background surface of the 2.4 and 2.7 engine
grille emblems was originally black or was it originally chrome from
the factory?

- -----End Included Message -----

With the exception of wiper arms and blades, nothing
(trim/badges/scrpit) was black before 1974. So 2.7s could be black on
some models but 2.4s were gold (even Ts I think). The grill itself had
several forms before '74 but now only black grills can be purchased as
new parts. There may have been a black engine grill in '73 as well.

Black trim on pre-74 911s is not original (so what... if you like it
leave it - or change it - to black).

I have one of the Crosslands books on 72-73 models where they reprint 
original review articles from auto magazines. In particular, one article 
mentions the sharp looking BLACK emblems (including a picture) on their new
'72 T. The engine grill, 911T, and PORSCHE emblems were black. The 2.4 emblem
(the original question) was, I believe, chrome. My 72T had chrome 911T and 
PORSCHE labels, so I assume it was an option.

Anyway, the authority on this is a book called "The 911 Restorer's Guide To 
Authenticity," or something to that effect.

Ted's response (paraphrased): KYB's are "better" than Bilsteins and Koni

As usual, Ted has picked what is on his car and offered it up as the penultimate
Porsche upgrade standard. No I haven't put shocks on any Porsches. However I
have used various brands on various other cars. KYB's are "better" if you are
looking for the cheapest possible shocks, but do not stand up to harsh treatment
like rough roads or racing or provide the best handling. Koni's ride the
hardest, but the only shocks that I have ever broken have been Konis. They also
force the rest of the suspension to be upgraded to really handle. Sport Konis
are definitely my choice for highlt strung street racers. Bilsteins last a long
time and offer the most usable ride. For shocks in general, I like Tokico's,
first adjustable and second non-adjustable (very cheap.) The quality seems to
beat out everything except for Bilsteins. Just my $.02

	I would like to know what kind of MPG figure you get with your
	'72 or '73 911.  I can't seem to get any better than 13 mpg
	with my '73 S.

A friend of mine has a very well maintained '73 S. He gets near 30 on
the highway (65 mph) and in the low 20s around town. (He once ran at 80
 -120 mph for about 4 hours on an interstate and got just over 20) I
found these figures to be very high. He was of the opinion low milage
can mean your MFI is leaky (runs way to rich) and is pumping too much
fuel into the engine. This, he claims, is a common failure mode as the
MFI unit gets old and tired. It is also possible your MFI unit is
mechanically sound but is way out of proper adjustment.

I'm sure there are other reasons why your mileage would be so low.
Almost any problem in the ignition system will also cause low mileage.
There are other more ugly causes, such as very bad leak down and rotten
compression.  Unless you are driving very very hard, your milage is
much too low.  Magazine reviews of the 911 from the period report much
higher milage (at least in the 20s).

I would check for fuel in your oil. This would implicate the MFI unit.
Fuel in the oil is not desireable as gasoline is not a lubricant.

Interestingly enough, I've been very impressed with the VDO clocks. Both of mine
work and keep really good time (20 and 16 years old) and the one in my dad's
'85 Carrera works like a champ, too. I've seen very few 911s at shops and swap
meets with non-functioning clocks. VDO clocks certainly seem to work better
than Veglia-Borletti italian clocks. Is there any particular vintage 911 you see
more than others with broken clocks? Could it be the climate where you live?

Anyway, I know that North Hollywood Speedometer can fix your clock. They have
advertisements in the back of Pano and Excellence. As for fixing it yourself,
I have found that most VDO instruments are well sealed and hard to get into
(I've wanted to clean the glass in my gauges for years--I hate it when they
fog up!).

Subject: Splitting subgroups -->more messages -->penises and testicles

If we split the group to a few categories, then those who tend to want EVERYONE 
to see their $0.02 will send it to all subcategories, along with the full text
of the message or series of messages they are replying to. Then those who  want
to browse through all messages in all categories will browse through the
multi-sent messages repeatedly. Unless Stan can filter effectively,  (and he
has said he is presently unable to handle the effort involved),  this may not
work as well as we want to, and it may create a monster like the Lernaea Hydra
(From Greek mythology, unsure of English spelling. This monster was a dragon
with multiple serpent heads. When one was cut off, two sprung up in its place
to replace it).  We will then have to resurrect Hercules to kill this monster
off. (Killing it was one of his twelve worthy deeds. He did it by cutting the
heads and torching the wounded necks before the double heads had time to spring
up. Stan, are you ready for this?  Hercules, by the way, was a demi-god - half
man/half god. I am sure Stan couldn't care less for Hercules status, but those
interested in the size of penises may be. Come to think of it, the latter may
be more interested in the Centaurs, who  were men from the belly up, horses 
from the belly down. And then there is that famous Centaur bronze status in the
middle of Paris that has two (or three?) human testicles as well as  definitely
three horse testicles, along with the two penises that go with them).

I think most of us can browse through and filter  what we are not interested in
reading, just as effectively, with the present system. Having said that,
ordering the digest messages in subcategories would work nicely for me.

I love the doulble-speak in this ad. "The Mirage 2001 receives a radar sig-

which confuses the radar computer ...".  What ?  I hate when I get those
holographic style computer viruses !  It then goes on to say that it
"is already electronically re-directing the signal away from the radar

Subject: Terrible Ted and the List


Hi Guys,

Just one of my sojurns into irritating reading. 

First, I suggest Mr. Matsumura change his name to Baka. He will understand the 
significance this surname as he has demonstrated this quality many times. A
good example is the devotion to KGB shocks. The only place they perform well is
parked in a locked garage.

Second, The list is fine. There are many participants, many models and all have
relevent (though at times trying) opinions and ideas. The various models have many
common traits and components, the information is all useful.

Third, whether anyone realizes it, this group meets more requently than any Porsche 
oriented social organization. With Internet, it is possible to be contacting Trond
in Norway, then in the next message hear from Kelvin in Australia. I like it. I also 
think it will change the way Porsche does business around the world in the next five 
years. If PCNA was listening in and getting the information and opinions expounded
by the list members, I think the marketing department would take a closr view of the 
secondary  Porsche market.

Fourth, I think that some video will be needed in the future to exchange technical 
documents, from Porsche and between members. This is above and beyond what Stan has 
provided, but something we should all consider. There will be CCD video cameras 
available for home use, it isn't far off. Scanners and video will do a lot for passing 
information like Mike Dayton's Torsion Bar article around. Images take space and 
fast machines, but the result has many benefits.

Just my $.02 for today.

I just ordered a couple of KG-5542 rear KYB's for my '77 911 with 
Bilstein struts.  I may have to go to another brand for the fronts, only 
Boge takes all type of shocks apparently for the front struts.  They are 
$31.95 each.  Not bad.  Steve at RD Enterprises (619) 282-8550 would make 
much more money by telling me Konis or Bilsteins are better, but he's an 
honest guy.  I recommend supporting these types of shops.

Also, a couple of people said that KYB's didn't last on their Audi's or 
whatever, has anyone had longevity problems with them on a 911?  If so, 
did you take advantage of the lifetime warranty?

Subject: RE: Radar detectors (Theo)


- ---------------Original Message---------------

Thanks for your latest message through the list. I am presently absorbed
in a municipal battle for rezoning building districts...very messy.
I still need the detector (badly, may be zapped any day), but must 
make the time to go buy it. It sounds as if you are in the middle of a
serious search. Three questions:
1. Should I wait a little longer, until you have finished your search,
   to benefit from your efforts? I would gladly do so, if you suggest.
   I trully am swamped, unable to do my own search, will have to take
   the results of yours and use them, of course all disclaimers you 
   want to think of/impose apply. 
2. I presume the 645ip has blinking (diode?) warnings and audio warnings
   as well as the LCD. I tend to stick the detector away from my field 
   of view (over mirror, passenger side, visual effects off) and rely on
   frequency/volume of audio signals to drive.
3. If you have finished the search and have concluded that the 645ip is 
   the model of choice, do I find it at my local Best Buy, Silo, Circuit
   City etc, or do you have a better source for the $215 price? 

   Thanks for all your help

- ----------End of Original Message----------

No use waiting longer, we have the 99% solution.  Initially, the price
for the 645ip was over $300 and I thought the 635ip a much better value.
Like you, I need it now!  (I borrowed a 620ip to try out, and Tuesday
night go saved.  I was 90mph on cruise, no other traffic nearby [>1/2mile]
when I got the audio.  From there, it was .8 mile to the x-ray machine.)
Any further savings will amount to mouse turds.

One serious issue, the price is from mail-order, something I am 
comfortable with, but which you may not be.  The price is from SBH...
(800-451-5851)  I have never worked with them before, but given that
I will use an Amex card, I'm reasonably sure that I'll be OK.

The 645 series is their flagship.  They put on a 3yr warranty vs. 1yr
for all other models.  They say it is 15-20% more sensitive than their
closest other series.  One thing to note, the 645STip is a "stealth" mode
detector, for those locations where detectors are illegal, if you need it.  
The 645 does have some blinking and more audio warnings.

Finally, Circuit City ($329) and Service Merchandise ($279) carry the 
645ip and you could go look at it there, before you order.

Don,
  Being the resident self-appointed tire and wheel expert, I recommend 
you stick with Porsche factory alloy wheels.  If you can't find/use 
these, then go with pressure cast mags, which bend upon high impact, but 
are probably safer during a crash than steel wheels.

I'm running Dunlop M40s up front in 205/55x16 on 7"x16 factory alloys

they hold as good as 195/50 Yokohamas, but do lift the car up an inch or

They can be used, if they'll last for one day.

Subject: Splitting the List?

As a new subscriber to the list, I feel like I walked into the middle of a
conversation about splitting the list. I would prefer that the list not be
split as many of the technical problems on Porsches are similar. I recently
finished installing a 3.2 w/Motronic in my 72 911T. I fired two brains, not
counting mine.But the fuel system was the most difficult part. I bought a new
aftermarket fuel pump to complete the installation (this is the condensed version-it took me about 4 months  to do this). THe car would not run over 1/2
throttle. I insulated the fuel lines, ran larger guage wire to the fuel pump
and changed the filter. Very little improvement. In talking with a friend
who works at the local dealer, I mentioned the problem. He said that they had
had a similar problem on 944's on which the fuel pump had been replaced. It
seems that the late model 911 and 944 pumps are the same. The problem is that
the aftermarket pump has a very fine filter screen in the inlet side of the
pump. This becomes clogged very easily and the restriction is enough to
prevent the engine from running at higher RPMs. The solution is to remove
the fine screen filter as there is a great filter in the engine compartment
prior to the fuel entering the injectors. The problem was easy to fix but
very difficult to trace. THis would seem to apply to 944's as well as911's.
SO don't split the list.

If you really want humiliation, try flashing your lights or waving at the

changed in the past 5 or ten years going from knowledable enthusiast to

Actually a review I've seen from that period (a clip from R&T I believe)
says the '73S got 13-17 mpg.  Perhaps the reported 30mpg was in a 914 ;-).

As another data point, the best my '73S has ever done (even after a proper
tune-up) was 19mpg on the highway.  I routinely get 10mpg doing the short 2.5
miles to and from school here, better with some other driving mixed in.  No
gas in the oil here, although with those short trips the car is still in its
enrichened warm-up stage.  But then I also have a heavy foot and the drivers
in NC are s l o w ...

I once got 40mpg in a carburetted 914, but that was when one of the intake
rocker arms fell off ;-).

I, too, have a severe problem of rear glass separating from the frame.
It seems that the pins in the back which hold down the hatch are
pulling the glass away from the front frame!  Although there is some
room for adjustment of the front frame mount points, it does not seem
to cure the problem.  And now, the pins barely fit into their latches
they are so far back.

I had a glass shop re-fit and glue the hatch once, but it has again
separated.  I'm looking for ideas...

The 914 ride height rule changes on a daily basis. It is really a shame that

nor should they have). I wish all of you luck, but I would not be very
optomistic. Keep in mind that you are delaing with a group that needed 3
years to figure out that the 91+RX-7 should be in SS!!!!! I do not know if

Subject: RX7 oil cooler for 911

If you have a hot running 911 this is a inexpensive way to add a front oil
cooler if you have the loop type cooler in front fender.
I used the oil cooler off a mazda RX7(i understand this is fairly common)
This cooler is to large to put in the fender and must be mounted up front with
some type of spoiler(RUF,930S etc)
I purchased the cooler from a junk yard for $50.The coolers are found on early
80's and up RX7's. The cooler is aprox. 24 in long and 4in wide at the tanks.
To use on a 911 it must be modified. I took the cooler to a shop that did
alluminum welding and radiator repair to have this done. cost $60
1) the one end of the cooler has a thermostat and the inlet/outlet fittings on
it(these inlet/outlets are to small to use on a 911).This end of the cooler must
be cut open at the end tank. The partition between the inlet and outlet that
the thermostat goes through must be removed.throw away thermostate.
2) with the partition removed a hole is cut and a bung fitting is welded to the
end of the tank (-12 or -16 size fittings should be used).The end tank is then
welded back to the cooler core.
3) On other end of cooler have a bung fitting welded in end tank.
4) have the cooler boiled out to remove any gunk from cooler
5) replace thermostate plug and put brass plugs in original inlet/outlet

you now have a cooler with fittings on each end, oil goes in one end and comes
out the other end

you now have to have oil lines made to hook lines in fender to front of the car.

You can buy 30mm to -12 fittings from aeroquip and use all the aircraft
quality fittings  and braided linbes but they are expensive.
I used a GATES fittings that I ordered from the local car quest(GATES part#
83786 ) this is a 30mm female on one end with a 3/4in barbed fitting on the
other.Two are needed. Cost aprox. $8.00 each. I then had a industrial supply
house that did hydraulic line make up lines, 30mm on one end -16 on the other.
They had several different types of hydraulic line that would work all were
overkill for pressure they will see. For the -16 ends i had 1 made with a
female strait and the other with a female 90 deg.I used a strait -16 male to
1inch pipe adapter on one end of the cooler(screws into bung fitting)and a 90
deg. -16 to inch pipe adapter on the other.Cost for hose and fittings $45.The
end result lookes like diag. below. now all you have to do is make a bracket to
mount the cooler to the front of the car.

Sorry for this somewhat late post (I'm just now catching up

adjustments will affect toe-in more than
toe-in adjustments will affect camber, so if you must make some camber
adjustments, I would plan on checking your toe-

likely not affect the camber changes you just worked so hard

I don't see why Stan would have to have extra maintenance.  His 
"master" list could simply receive from other lists and re-post to his 
subscribers who want it all.

To minimize overhead for Stan, senders should send general to the general 
list, and 944 messages to the water pumper list, and have those lists 
include porschephiles@tta.com in their distribution.

These types of things never work the first time, they take some time to 
sort out.  There will be overlap always, but if people follow the 
general guidelines, a user with a 928 could for example, just read 928 
messages and general porsche messages, without getting hit with too many 
911 tech and 914 restoration messages.

is in very nice condition. It is a '91 with auto, air, sunroof, full supple

sees it says it is the best looking 928 they have seen. We are buying a new

Jerry,

Yes.  Value!

The Valentine is not 100% better by any estimate, and the BEL won 
some important categories.  The BEL is $215, the Valentine $400.

Finally, I owned a BEL for the last ten years.  No radar tickets
in all that time.  And I have taken trips from Denver, CO to
Monterey, CA that began at 8AM(PST) and ended at just after
midnight the same day.  [90mph avg. INCLUDING gas/food/stops]

So, it worked for ten years (stolen), never got me a ticket, and I 
can get it anywhere for a reasonable price. Not for everybody, 
but that formula works for me.

Hope you make a good choice and get no tickets.;-);-)

Jascha,

I posted something about this recently.  At the risk of repeating myself,
here goes.  Because of its design, over time and with (ab)use the
angle between a 911 spindle and the strut can change.  One approach is
to replace the part when this is diagnosed.

A slightly better approach is taken by the shop I hang around.  They've
had a machinist make them what is basically a large protractor, which
they use to recalibrate the angle.  Having done so, they then strengthen
the strut with a pair of gussets.

Perhaps a local Porsche repair place can do the same for you.  Or if
you would like to have my friends take care of you, give them a call.

Subject: When the chips are down...

I know that aftermarket chipping is a pretty popular subject on this
(and other) lists, and thought you might be interested by this story.

A customer brought his 5-series BMW into the shop yesterday for some
work.  Among other things, he asked to have an Autothority chip put
in.  Fine, no big deal.

The shop has a chassis dyno, and they like to understand and endorse
what they sell.  So what the heck, Jerry decided to check out the
performance difference.  Here's what he found:

  4000 RPM: up about 3 to 4 hp
  5000 RPM: up about 1 hp
  6000 RPM: down about 15 hp
  7000 RPM: down about 20 hp.

The Autothority chip made *LESS* power at 6000 and 7000 RPM than
the factory chip.  To qualify these figures, let me point out a
few things.  First, the test was performed A-B-A, ie, factory chip,
then Autothority, then back to the factory.  This was done to avoid
any disparity due, for example, to tire heating and slippage on
the dyno wheel.

The tests were all done within a few minutes of each other.  No
massive cold fronts blowing in, changing ambient temp and pressure.

The figures were horsepower at the wheels.  Count on a minimum 18%
parasitic loss, typically more, with respect to engine power.

The 5000 RPM figure is definitely in the noise, and the 4000 RPM
one might as well be though of that way too.  Not that the chip
might not make a teeny bit more power there.  But you just cannot
really measure a one or two horsepower difference.

Needless to say, Jerry recommended to the customer that he not
bother with the chip.  For $400, the customer was happy to accept
this advice.

Caveat Emptor.  Now, about that throttle body...

It cost me $1,000 to learn this one. I'll pass it on for free.

Before wasting your time with a detailed inspection of the car, you can
check for serious under-body rust by simply opening and closing the doors a
few times.
The door should pop open and swing freely the moment the latch is released.
Any sticking, binding, or resistance is almost a sure sign that serious
rust is causing the body to sag.
If it requires any effort at all to get the door to move once the latch has
released, just walk away from it and shop elsewhere.

  On my carb'd 914, the electronic fuel pump is powered off the ign
coil circuit which also supplies juice to the backing lights, etc.
  The reverse switch on the transmission makes and breaks the circuit
to these backup lights and the ground path for the lamps are
provided thru the usual brown wire, daisy-chain style.

  The designers of the wire harness opted to break the power circuit
rather than the ground circuit to the lamps (not sure why).
  And now as the years pile up...these switches tend to short to ground
causing a blown fuse or in my case, heated wires and no fuel, spark
weak.  
  This can also wreak havoc on your indicators like fuel and tach.

  So, if you have a 914-4 that dies or smokes wires or fuses when 
selecting reverse gear..one side of the switch is shorting to ground.
  And you will either need a new switch or the wiring at the switch
is hosed (which is also probable).

  Root Cause Analysis indicates the nylon housing/insulation cracks and
fails with age/heat/contamination, this in turn allows the barrel
connectors to float and make intermittent contact to the case of the
transmission (ground).  It is also possible to have the other half
of the switch short which would cause a similar failure unrelated to
what gear the trans is in.

  I cant emphasize the importance of this small detail.
  Another one of those things with 914's..

Hi gang,

I know this sounds redundant, but the Collopy Clan is on the move again....
which means that those four wheels need to move out of storage.  What wheels?
The original Porsche factory wheels from Paul's 84 944.  7J as designated
on the sticker; car originally had 15" tires.  Price?  Anything reasonable you
are willing to contribute to the fund of either of three tuitions, two moving
bills, or the 914 restoration.  Perusing the pricing sheet of options from
four days before the purchase, the wheels had a U.S. retail price of $725.
Anybody know what the 'Tourist Delivery Price' means?  And, while I'm at
it, anybody want to purchase the 944 (with 16" Ronal wheels)?  Inky is
getting a bit too expensive for us.  Like my daddy always said "when your
outgo exceeds your income your upkeep becomes your downfall".  Since Inky
gets treated like a member of the family, the car has been faithfully
maintained.  She's black metallic/black interior, purchased new by Paul.
Have all, (most?) the service records.  Insurance is $79 a year (not a
typo) for us.  
$5k negotiable.  Car is in Cincinnati, Ohio.  (The southern part of Ohio).

Hi Kris/John

Roger that.  Hell, when I was in High School, driving our '54 Beetle, I would 
always wave or flash the lights (no light-horn on those old, US models, had to 
quickly pull-out the Light switch and then push it back) at *every* sports-car, 
and *usually* got friendly response in kind.  Rarely found instances of chambers

You are (sadly) all to right today tho; the situation is reversed and there

I admit that I quit hailing most others, long ago, but still hail vintage 
marques and selected others, and am often rewarded with replies.

But hell, don't let some asshole define how *you* behave.  Wave/flash anyway.
If they don't respond appropriately, take it as concrete sign of your *Moral*

In addition to giving very good results, it is electronically fairly quiet,

Matt,

Don't have my manual here, but the Blau ARI system was designed to be a 
constant radio monitoring system for special -- ARI -- warning broadcasts. I 
think it may have been esatblished in a few cities for a little while, a few 
years back, but I don't think it is operating anywhere now. Did you ever 
notice how Blaupunkt radio digits stay lit while the tape was playing, unlike 
most other brands? Apparently, the receiver is still operating, listening for 
those ARI signals, and will interrupt the tape, or radio, if it gets a 
warning. If the ARI button is pushed on my Tuscon, after about 15 seconds a 
loud beeping starts, warning you that the ARI carrier signal has been lost. 
The Zone button allows you to select different ARI zones. Anyway, they don't 
do anything useful.

Hi, Magnus.
 
Unleaded fuel will not cause your valves to recede. Your '82 has the same
valves used for U.S. market cars, which had catalysts and required unleaded
fuel at that time.
 
While I was at Porsche one of my projects was measuring valve seat recession
on a non-Porsche engine. The engine was run on a dynamometer, alternating
between max. power and max. torque, for I think 200 hours. There was no
measurable valve seat recession. End of story.
 
This folklore got its start when very old cars with old-style soft valve
seats had to switch to unleaded; yes, a rebuild on such a car should include
hardened valve seats.

Subject: Reno SQR 46 radio

Hi, Matt.
 
ARI is a German traffic radio information service. Normal radio stations
broadcast a brief signal tone before traffic bulletins. This is used to do
something to your radio, but now I forget what. I think if you are listening
to a cassette and it detects a traffic bulleting coming in, it momentarily
stops the cassette and turns to the radio. Also, I think some radios can
detect if the station is ARI-capable while you are tuning, and light up an
indicator to tell you that this station will carry traffic info. Generally,
these German traffic reports are as useless over there as ours are over here.
They either 1) don't tell you about the traffic jam you are about to
discover, or 2) tell you about the one you are in, or 3) urgently warn you
about the one that disappeared 3 hours ago.
 
All this is academic because we don't have ARI in this country.
 
I don't know what the "zone" does. I don't think it's simply a close/distant
sensitivity switch, but you can try that on a weak station to see if it
cancels it out, or refuses to pick it up when scanning. Maybe it was to
select zones of radio coverage (all traffic reports in Suedwestdeutschland,
und so weiter).
 
You can call Robert Bosch Corp. in Broadview, IL, I think they have an 800
number, ask for the Blaupunkt department and they will be happy to send you
a manual, maybe even for free.

Subject: Steel wheels, KYBs, and Ted

Donn Munn asked about inexpensive alloys.
 
Ted M stuck his face in it again with another inane blathering.
 
Cast alloy (I don't care if they're pressure cast, sand cast, plaster
cast, or supporting cast) do not bend more than steel wheels on impact. They
either survive, or fracture. They don't bend much. Contrary to Ted's wisdom,
steel wheels are not inferior to cast aluminum in terms of absorbing crash
energy. They are heavier, which is the main reason for going to aluminum.
That, and aluminum is sexier. Most cars ever made had steel wheels, and many
still do.
 
Not that it matters, most of us don't do the curbsurfing thing like Ted. But
when they fracture, you can't put them in a plaster cast until they heal.
 
And while I'm on it, Ted, if you're reading this, what the flying f--k does
history have to do with selecting shocks? Are we supposed to draw some sort
of Deming lesson on engineering expertise or quality control from the
Japanese, and replace every part on our Porsches with stuff from the Far
East? Don't you think Porsche would put KYBs on their cars if they could
save a few Marks (even their marketing department now realizes that price
is a major hurdle)? Porsche uses Yokohama and Bridgestone tires not because
their engineers are history buffs, or "Nazi sheep" as you put it, but because
they're the best for the job. The KYBs are not. KYBs are widely regarded as
shit. I don't care if they have a lifetime guarantee, that's a job I don't
want to do more than once on a MacPherson-strut car. I have 18-year-old
Bilsteins on one non-Porsche car, they still work fine at 150,000 miles;
I have adjustable Konis on two 356s, they work fine too. You get what you
pay for, and TANSTAAFL (there ain't no such thing as a free lunch); that's
an economics lesson, not a history lesson.
 
If Japanese origin is your criterion for quality, why don't you just
go back where you belong -- the driver's seat of an Acura Integra, lowered,
blacked out, loud stereo, baseball cap on backwards. Watch those curbs!
 
To everybody else on the list, I propose we set up a collection for Ted, to
get him a going away present when he offs that collection of non-Japanese
inferior parts and gets back in the Integra, where a man belongs. He needs
one of the following stickers for his rear window: Oakley Factory Pilot,
Bad Boy Club, or Kenwood. Stan, can you set up a trust fund for the
terminally ignorant?

Subject: Clicking, not starting

Hello,

A few days ago, and this morning, when I went to start my
'81 911 SC, the starter did not turn, but only made a clicking
noise with each turn of the key in the ignition.

The battery is fine, and the clicking noise came from the engine
area, probably the starter itself?  Does this mean its time for a
new starter?  Is there a relay that is making the clikcing which
I need to replace, or is the only thing that makes a clicking noise
in the rear upon startup the starter itself?

How much does a starter for a 911SC cost, and where is a good place
to get one?  Do they have rebuilt ones?  Is this a difficult job
to replace the starter myself (I did this a few times on my two
Jeep CJ-7's)?  I am most concerned about cost/labor, since I just
paid my tuition, and don't have alot of cake right now.  

It finally did start, after a few minutes, and probably 10-15 times 
turning the key, with the click each time.  The other day when this
happened, I only had to turn the key 3-4 times.  As if it is getting
worse.  But it started fine for the day in between today and then.

Any suggestions?

just where the braces meet the wheel. Hit the top to change up, or 
the bottom to change down either side. The reviewer seem pretty

Steve,

Unless your right foot weighs 500 pounds, I would tend to think that 13mpg is
way low. On the highway you should get gas mileage in the twenties. Your
car is either running real rich, or you've got a fuel leak.

On the same subject, my dad and I drove to Indianapolis for the Tweeks swap
meet in July. He drove his '85 Carrera and I drove my '74 Carrera which has
a 3.0l SC engine and Webers. So I knew I wouldn't get *near* the gas mileage
he would. SURPRISE! He got 26.5mpg and I got an absolutely amazing 25.5mpg!
With Webers! And cruising at 75-80MPH. Of course he could've done better by
not running his AC (my AC is of the natural variety). But I really thought
the Motronic would have my Webers whupped!

I have found that naturally-aspirated 911s are extremely efficient
when in proper tune. The turbocharged cars are pretty much gas hogs (and 100
octane gas for hot summer weather is EXPENSIVE!). These cars are perfect for
long trips. I don't know of any other car that can leave Raleigh, NC with a
full tank of gas and get to Indianapolis, IN with only one fill-up in between.
And still have 1/4 tank left over!!!

times weren't bad!

I was very happy that Ted said he ran a 54 (I think) on the same
course!  Yes, there were some sub 50's and I think one 46 in a race
prepped 914 or something.  I guess an 'ol '70 911T running all season
tires and the original Zenith carbs is not a bad auto-xer.  I do
know that as courses get faster our light and pretty torquey car
would get killed by HP, brakes and tires (if you believe that wider
tires are better......) but it was pretty good in these second
gear courses.

My wife and I both let an instructor take us for a ride in our car
and we humbled.  The hardest or at least most un-natural part for
both of us was the late/hard braking.  Years of trying to be a
smooth street driver are hard to break.
 
Yes, we'd go again.  Yes, we'd like to try an auto-x.  Yes, we'll
probably now join one of the local PCA's.

Anybody that hasn't tried this, go do it.  The important thing
is to learn more about your Porsche, improve your driving, and
have some fun.  Drag your SO out there with you, I'll bet that
they enjoy it.

Oh, we averaged over 15mpg for the weekend of auto-xing and driving
to and from Candelstick.  I like my little ol 911T!

I second your comment.  I had some Armani shaded jerk in a '76 911 try to 
race me on the way to Marin, CA last weekend.  Don't worry I took care of
him, I guess he doesn't know the difference between a '73 T and a '73 S.
It was interesting, once I got above 4krpms in 4th gear, it was impossible
for him to pass me.  I backed off and he didnt even glance my way, just 
shamefully ran off with his tail beaten.  I thought the mid70 911s were
still pretty fast.  Maybe it would have been a better match if he had a
911S instead of a 911.

        As a possible project car, I have come across a black 94 C2 Cab
that was a theft recovery. The gentleman ( who seems to specialize in
theft/salvage cars)
can provide most of the missing C2 parts - engine/tranny would be a 92 - so
hence I would pick up a shell plus loose parts, sheet metal, interior. He
doesn't appear to be a chop shop stealing/recycling Porsches 

        Price is around 30k. West coast 94 C2 cab's seem to be worth around 55k.
I guesstimate 10k max to make up for loose/missingstuff/mistakes/paint/etc
hence I would have a 40k net 94 C2. Not bad on paper...

Has anyone on the net played with theft recoverys ? What experiences has
anyone had ?

At the Portland IMSA-WSC race last weekend, Hugh Fuller, driving a Spice,
smacked into another car while entering the chicane...

  "The Spice launched into the air like a Hollywood cop car, landing in a
clever imitation of Joie Chitwood-and-then-some, which is to say on its
side, where it ground to a halt.
  A veteran of maybe 20 motor races, Fuller knew exactly what to do next.
He unstrapped himself and tumbled out of the car into a soft quilted ball
on the concrete, bounced back up, and proved the exceptional balance of the
Spice chassis by nudging it and watching it tip back down on its tires.
Then he climbed back in and drove off, WITHOUT LOOSING SECOND PLACE."

I guess there's no 13/13 rule in WSC racing. :->

Mike,
  If you're talking about stats for last Sundays auto-x, good luck.  Hank 
came by while we were timing 914's and mentioned how scary it was with 
all rookies running the timers, and I mentioned, "no problem, we're just 
one car off"  Now what I meant by that was that we were a car behind, so 
ever car and time that we were doing on track one (green group) is skewed.

also, some are heavily skewed, when two green 914s are there, we didn't 
know which one it was, so we guessed.  There was no 2 way communications 
from the grid to the trailer on course 1, so they would never repeat and 
we would just grab the card that looked like the vehicle on course. 

Now if the people timing our group caught on a little faster, great, 
otherwise, I would go by these little stubs from Automotion with times on 
them.

Also, the DNF's for exiting in the wrong place are bogus, my instructor 
couldn't even find the exits.  The cones were way too close.

In the chapter on engine rebuild fundamentals in Bruce Andersons

there have been problems with after market valve springs and
(if I remember correctly) suggests not replacing them unless
absolutely necessary.

I have purchased a complete set of new valve springs (for around $80).
I was going to replace them as a matter of course.  The engine has
68,000 miles and ran beautifuly before I pulled it out.  I am now
wondering whether I should be replacing them if there is a good chance
of problems with the new springs.

Hey, hold on there! Ted is an entertainment treasure for all of us. I think
this idea that you'd have to have *publically* ragged on him to qualify for
the Nazi Sheep Club makes it too exclusive and would likely trigger a wave
of gratuitous Ted-bashing just to get into the club. That sort of thing

by trying to split the list so that only part of the group could read the

Kris, (or John?)

   Don't be too offended about people not waving. I drive a '93 RS America
and find that it works both ways.  I believe it's less an issue of snobbery
and more a function of their involvement in the marquis.  There are alot of
Porsche owners (both new and old) that consider it to be "just a car" and
have no idea what this flashing lights/waving thing is.  After all, nobody
does this when they're driving their Land Rover...;-). They probably either
don't have the owner's manual, or have never read it. There are also many
who simply aren't paying attention to the goings on around them (Utahn's
seem to have a propensity for this). 


I live in Sandy, and I assume that you're at the UofU. If 

you ever see a Grand Prix white RS America with a bra and a roll bar, be
sure to flash and wave.  You can be assured that I'll do the same.
Also, if your interested, I'm the treasurer for the Intermountain Region
PCA.  If you're not a member of PCA, you should join.  We hold a variety
of events, from concours and tours, to autocrosses and club races.  Oh,
the club does throw a pretty good party, now and then, as well.

2) How hard is it to replace a head gasket...?
I have a good set of tools and I have done a good amount of work in the past

Subject: RE: ted's adventure report

 Ted's BIG Adventure -
 
 This was the local Porsche club's two day autocross school.  Thus it 
 included instructors for both days.  Periodically the instructor would 
 let you drive by yourself so they could watch you from outside your car 
 (see if you could do what they had instructed you without being talked 
 through it or cause they needed a break from the right seat).  Times 
 being posted were not listed in any class order but rather by the group 
 you were assigned to run in (i.e. beg.lat 911, waterpumpers, intermediate 
 914, intermediate 911, etc.).  No class structure was used at the 
 school.  Ted was listed in the beginning late 911 group.
 
 Saturday was individual instruction on various small shapes like a double 
 box, skid pad, decreasing radius (figure 8), oval, slalom, etc.  On 
 sunday, the students had two complete autocross courses to run/work at 
 diffierent times.  One course was a tight/short coure and the other was 
 longer and a little more open.  Depending on the group, you could do a 
 one lap pratice/one lap timed format or one lap practice/two laps timed 
 format.  This did cause some confusion on the posted times reported to 
 me, but was easily straightened out.
 
 Below are the results compiled (in seconds) about the best instructors, 
 instructors, good students and Ted.
 
 				tight/short		longer
 				  course		course
 
       	best instructors           45-46                 61-62
          instructors              48-49                 65-66  
         good students             51-53                108-110
             "Ted"                   55                 110-112 
 
 You make you own interpretation of these results.  I know that two 
 seconds is a lot of time to make up at an autocross, let alone 9-10.  
 Though with practice at least 5-6 seconds will come off quick.

 There were some RS America's present and I know of at least one husband 
 and wife that both turned times in the 50's on the tight/short course.  I 
 also know that when I personally looked at the posting sheets for the 
 tight course I saw a DNF and a "blank" posted for Ted's runs.  There was
 some confusion on the exit gate of the tight/short course but that is
 part of autocrossing (not the confusion, but "knowing" where to go).  Even
 so, I have listed Ted's times for that course.
 
 Most, if not all instructors had times better than Ted's.

 Tight/short courses generally equallize different advantages certain cars 
 have - what happened Ted?
 
 And this 911 lift throttle understeer thing?

Re 911 2.4L grill emblem

  I looked at my two 72 T 2.4L grills, one on the car and my spare,
  and the emblem is a chrome "2.4" set against a black anodized background.

  This could have been done by fabricating the emblem in aluminum,
  black anodizing the background while clear anodizing the "2.4".

  In my samples, on one the black anodizing has faded considerably.  
  
  The grill itself is black anodized aluminum.  It must have been costly to
  produce, with many aluminum pieces to assemble and an anodizing process.
  The emblem is a separate piece riveted on.

  It is not surprising Porsche went to a one-piece black plastic grill later.

List question:

  Has anyone installed piston crown oil squirters in an early 911 case?  

  I have access to a Bridgeport mill, tool room lathe and a hydraulic press
  which should be adequate tooling for the job.

  I've looked through my factory shop manuals and have found no information.

  I don't have a sample junk 911 case with squirters, but maybe someone does.

  Questions are:

    What diameter hole is drilled?

    Exactly where is it placed in the web?

    How is the squirter installed?  Is it pressed into place with a
    custom drift? 

Re: UPFIX'N books

  At the Carlsen swap I bought the latest volume of the PCA UPFIX'N
  series.  Now I have all nine.

  Since my cars are >20 years old, I figured there would be little
  useful stuff in the latest UPFIX'N.  

  I was wrong, there was good info about installing a 911 replacement dash,
  a task I'll be attempting this weekend.  Also an article on rear 
  spring plates and the newer oil lines for the Carerra tensioners.

  $19.00 well spent.

  IMHO, these UPFIX'N are valuable adjuncts to the factory manuals.  They
  should be one of the first purchases a new Vintage Porsche owner should
  make, even if they're not planning on doing their own work.  

  While these are reprints of technical articles in the PCA
  Panorama magazine, they are far easier to refer to than a pile of
  old Panorama's.

  To purchase them you're supposed to be a PCA member.

  Maybe there is a way around this for Porschephile members.

I enjoyed your story, but I feel the need to point out to you that
YOU are the one tailgating, thus you committed the first transgression.

I disagree with the way the other drivers dealt with you, however. Did they
indicate to you that you were following too close (i.e. tap the brakes) ?
If so, are you the kind of driver to respect the wishes of other drivers 
and try to yield some space ?

I think a general rule of thumb is if you're getting flipped off alot,
maybe you aren't driving with enough courtesy and respect for those you
share the road with. (It's possible that everyone else is an asshole,
but some self-examination is in order here).

I also take exception with you using the public roads for your high speed
fun (whatever that entails). If you can guarantee that no one other than
yourself is at risk, then by all means do it, but I don't think you can
make that guarantee. Keep your racing confined to the track, please.

Am I a car enthusiat prude ? In some cases yes. Like when my infant daughter
is in her carseat next to me, I'm not inclined to test the performance of
my german engineered motor car, nor am I inclined to tolerate someone like
you tailgating me. I'd tap the brakes, or slow to give you a better chance
to pass, or even pull over. I also would not flip you off. I would just
wave and smile and marvel at the people out there who are desperately in
search of a life.

Bull-shift Pete.  Remember my story about the sidewalk?  My front BBS RA 
pressure cast wheel bent, it absorbed energy from the car on impact with 
the curb and *bent*  It did not survive, it needs fixin', it's dented, 
it's not fractured.  If I had on it, the old rusted 356/914 type steel 
wheels that many people like yourself still use and recommend, I and the 
car would be history (which I will address below...).

Porsche buys their parts from OEM's, not from Winchester Auto and RD 
Enterprises.  It would not surprise me if the Boxster used *more* 
Japanese parts than current and existing Porsche cars.  (Yes, if you did

With regards to all the recent conversation on "stealth" devices such as the
Cabrella bra, I would like to know if anyone out there is familiar with the
K40 Laser Diffuser which purportedly makes the car untrackable with a laser
device. It is a license plate frame that supposedly sends out a signal which
electronically "diffuses" laser. I was told it wouldn't work on my 911 due to
the downward slanting of the front license plate mount. Any comments?

BTW, for those of you commenting on the clocks in 911, be thankful you don't
drive Lamborghinis. The Diablo clock is optional; a hand-winding Bregeut (I

Subject: Radar absorbers, passive or active ECM, and the carbrella.

Subject:  Radar absorptive dialogue.

  Greetings all.
  I've been reading the recent threads about radar.
There's a lot to be said about what technique and how, read on for a few 
moments and I will add some further dimension.
  This does not cover laser radar...that's another animal.

  To scramble or to absorb the offending radar waves?
      active  ===   passive  electronic counter-measures  (ECM)

  I would vote passive...why?
    In a short time, if everyone was scrambling...the feds would outlaw it.
    But if the chosen few (pfiles) were ABSORBING the fed would never know.

  You've seen the ads for the 'carbrella' absorptive bras...well that's
passive and virtually undetectable (ECM) stealth technology.

  How does it work?
  There is available to the public a product called 'ferrite'.
  This is a remarkable material that has the capability to absorb
electromagnetic radiation at frequencies up to and including microwave radar.
  By using this material in the correct formula and placement, aircraft, cars
missles, and buildings can be made 'invisible' (or relatively so) to radar.

  There are other materials that exhibit similar properties, but suffer from
limitations, namely environmental susceptibility.  Ferrite does not have this
problem, so its application to a 'bra' would be an excellent choice.

  So how does the 'carbrella' work?
  I wish I had one to dissect (anyone?), but I can make an educated guess.
 -its an ordinary bra with either an array of ferrite beads, tiles, or
granules, or carbon impregnated foam (more than simple carbon tho') with a
bra-like cover.  This fits over the front of the car and hood and forms
a 'shadow' that the remainder of the vehicle occupies during frontal
exposure to radar, thus reducing the effective 'radar cross section' that
the radar gun is depending on to reflect its emissions and deliver a speed
reading.  *whew*

  The radar gun is designed to discriminate a target based on velocity
threshold and reflected signal intensity.  One reason you can get away
speeding in heavy traffic...the cops dont know which target to choose,
a 'target rich environment' -unless you are visually blowing doors off...

  Up till the advent of 'instant on' radar, Analog to Digital converters
could not do enough conversions in time to spot you *IF* you slammed on
the brakes as soon as your detector gave warning..its called sample rate.
And if your vehicle's speed was changing fast enough, the discriminating
logic would fail to lock on..you escaped again.  But that's old-hat now.

  I wish I could tell you all exactly how to roll your own 'radar bra'
but I dont have any ferrite tiles yet.  and there are other problems like
the tiles are 100mm square and 10mm thick and weigh 325 grams..putting these
on your car might require a mess of them and that could get heavy.
  The alternatives would be type 42 material beads or shards-lots of 'em, 
enough to single or double layer a solid sheet the size of a bra.
  The vendor for these materials is:  Fair-rite of Walkill, NJ. 
  (I like their number)  914.895.2055  tile part number:3642011601

  A valuable clue as to the construction of the 'carbrella' would be its
weight and material thickness...(anyone?).
  If I had a carbrella, I could analyze it to some degree, but my equipment
does not go above 1.5 GHZ and that is where speed radar has its domain.

  Sorry -no formulae or theory..I'm not a scientist or engineer, just a tech.

Those of you who have been following my fun with the a/c blower switch

here's the latest curiosity.

I've been noticing when I turn the ignition to the spot just before 
cranking the engine, a "blower" sound started to come from my engine 
compartment.  I have tracked it down and guess what - it's the A/C which 
is running.  Must be running all the time!  The problem is HOW DO I TURN 
IT OFF?  As noted above, the blower sitch is completely disconnected (so 
none of the cool air being created gets used anyway).  The only other 
switch I have is the "temperature control" switch which does NOT turn the 
condensor off.  How is it possible for the a/c unit to be running?  I 
thought the blower switch controlled on/off for that (and its completely

Subject: experts!?!, wheels and Whistler



For all of you self-appointed experts on the net, please don't give an
opinion or make a statement unless you have done your research. This is
completely contrary to the purpose of Pfiles and potentially dangerous. I
believe that I speak for many users of the list when I say that we use it
to extract valuable information from people who have knowledge derived
from real experience or research who are interested enough to share it
with other interested Pfilers. An expert does not appoint him/herself, an
expert is someone whose opinion or statement is recommended by OTHER
people (i.e. Stan). 

On the subject of wheels, Thak (I think it was) was correct about forged
wheels bending and cast wheels cracking. But which wheels are which? I did
some RESEARCH and found the following:
	911 Fuchs - all forged aluminum
	914 Fuchs - 4 (2L) and 5 spoke forged aluminum
	914 10 spoke - (I think these are Pedrini?) cast light alloy
	Water Cooled - I didn't check, I'm not really interested.
This information was found in the Porsche lovers bible "Excellence Was
Expected" by Karl Ludvigsen. This book is an (expensive) must-have for
Porschephilers. I don't know which wheels is the lightest, but that would
be very important if you were using 1 pound lugnuts (baka-nuts).

On the subject of splitting the list, Stan has spoken. Be appreciative of
the potentially extremely valuable resource he provides. End of discussion.

I hope to meet some of you pfilers at Whistler, maybe we could arrange an
informal gathering there and talk face to face. Suggestions anyone?

While I certainly don't doubt any of the numbers above, I certainly 
challenge their statistical credibility and implications.  While our 
group was timing the 914's for 2 hours or so, we didn't see any below 49 
seconds, including Ray Scruggs, and Hank Watts taking a red 911 Carerra 
out.  I did see an instructor in a Fiero get a 47 or 48.  How many scores 
were actually below say 49? a dozen? half dozen? by how many individuals? 
2, 4, 6? out of how many enrolled?  150 students?  

The "short" course was actually longer around than the 2 lap one where as 
many people were getting timed for a single lap.  We (who did 1/2) also 
got our split times, if you cared to note that info.  My 4th instructor 
(Sun. afternoon) didn't get any better in my car, than I got on the 2 lap 
course.  We both did 1:10.  Many of the people I spoke with from my 
original group (I was in early 911 group Sat - white group,  then moved 
to late model 911 group - green on Sunday) were getting tops of 36 or 37 
lap or split times, while I had a 35. 

To summarize, most of the instructors did better than me, and some of the 
students did.  What I would like to see if you have this data, is where I 
was relative to *all* the students, what percentile, SAT type statistics?

Got 'em?

Thanks,

On my '76, at least getting the instruments out is easy (as opposed
to some earlier models). The black cover (a bezel) is pressed over the
glass. I carefully pried it off with a small screwdriver around
about 3/4 of the diameter. Sooner or later you will be able to pop
the bezel off the instrument. Be carefull, as always, to note the 
order of gaskets, etc. you remove. The tach in my 914 has a crack
right in the middle of the glass that causes the glass to "bend"
inward when the car interior is hot. Then it rubs against the
tach needle freezing it at 0 RPM until the interior cools. Took me
a while to realize the instrument wasn't broken. Alas, I digress. 
After you replace the glass with the closest US thickness (didn't
seem to be too much diference), you can carefully rebend the bezel
around the glass. If you're carefull, with just a tiny bit of
black touchup paint, you won't be able to tell. The rubber mounting
ring helps to hide any gouges.

Be prepared all ye who live in "non-attainment" areas as defined by EPA. 
New rules are in the works (have been for a time) to change the current
tests to a battery of tests supposedly more indicative of true driving.
As far as passing in the short term, the CIS "mixture" adjustment is a
small screw that you can access through a small hole located in between
the fuel distributer and the large rubber boot that conveys air from
the air box up, left, then down to the throttle body. The hole is
covered (sometimes) by a small rubber grommet (hint... easy to lose).
The screw is turned by a long stemmed allen wrench (4 mm ?). It's a 
cheap tool at your local tool store (Not Porsche). Do remember where
the setting was before you started. Unless you have a CO analyzer,
you'll never get the mixture right back where you started. Obviously
one way is richer, one is leaner, so just rock it a bit. If the test
is only at idle, there is another adjustment screw located under the
CIS metering plate that only affects the idle mixture. Remember that
a leaner mixture produces less pollutants but also less HP.
All my experinnce is with non-turbo CIS cars, so take my suggestions in 
that regard. As EPA says, You [car] may vary!

2) The tools required to dismantle the head and cam carrier are not that

Wrong. My wife dinged the cast wheels on our volvo wagon. ding. no crack. Sorry.


Metals exhibit three stages of deformation brfore failure:

 -Primary or elastic creep: After deformation, the part returns to its
original shape, with no loss in strength.

 -Secondary creep: Part no longer returns to the original shape, associated
propagation of microcracks.

 -Tertiary creep: Accelerted deformation requiring less force than in the
secondary phase. Necking, followed by failure.

 -Just plain creep: Some geek who insists on taking all the fun outa stuff.


You can test the first three with a strip of metal (steal a spoon from your
mom).

Subject: Automobile Quarterly -- "Elfer through the ages"

The current issue of AQ has an excellent (and long) article on the
history of the Elfer. Very interesting is the photograph of Butzi's
original conception as a four seater -- greenhouse looks like a big
version of the 356's removable top. Interesting too, is the original
conception of the engine -- one camshaft above the crankshaft and one
below -- with pushrods operating the valves. Fortunately, they changed
to the SOHC.

Also interesting is their comparison "911 Alt Und Neu" -- 
1966 911	1994 911 Speedster
1991cc		3600cc
145 bhp		247 bhp
2750 lbs	3170 lbs
132 mph		162 mph
$6,500		$75,073

They wrote of the alt:

This was a very competent and nible car that was easy to drive in 
traffic and offered strong acceleration (for the day).

And the neu:

Once that big flat six is whirring and the car is moving, the experience
becomes more gratifying. ... In traffic, the car feels ponderous and heavy,
and with the sloping extremities, bulging fenders and blinder-like top,
you're constantly afraid of bending $75,000 worth of German steel.

In closing:

As the world changed, so did the cars. Thirty years and 100 horsepower
later, from behind the wheel these are two entirely different cars --
only the badge on the nose and the model number remains the same.

FORZA!

Subject: Inoperative Tach

Greetings to all!

This is my first posting to the list, so I beg the group's indulgence
(especially in these touchy times!).

A couple of times now, when I start up my 1977 911S, everything seems to
operate normally except for the tach (original, VDO).  The tach needle just
sits on the detente irrespective of the engine RPMs.  After about five
minutes of driving, the tach comes to life, and  operates normally (more or
less) from then on. 

This condition occurs usually when the car has been sitting in the sun for
four or five hours, and the day is warm (85+ degrees F).  

On a related (?) note, I notice that the tach readings at other times will
fluctuate initially, then settle to more "normal" readings. For example, the
tach may read 3400 at 65 MPH in fifth,  bounce up to 4000, stay at that level
for a few minutes, then settle back to 3400.

I checked the wiring diagram, and it appears that the tach is serially(!?)
connected to the ignition system.  Does that suggest that these glitches may
be early warning for more disabling problems?  

Any similar experience from the group? I welcome any and all advice. (Ted,
you drive a '77-- ANY input would be greatly appreciated!) 

Thanks,

That's the heater indicator light.  It goes on the center tunnel carpet just
to the right of the end of the parking brake (when it's down).  It should be
connected to a little wire that snakes down from under the dash, under the
carpet, and through a slit in the carpet at the said location.

It's one of those mutant features that was picked up from the 914's late in

Electronics aren't my area of specialty, these days it seems like I'm the 
tire/wheel/handling expert.  However, when I put a '78 3l engine in place 
of the 2.7, I also replaced the VDO tach itself and wiring with the '78 
to simplify the replacement, the '78 has addl. wiring I believe, as I 
think it uses electronic CD ignition and rev limiter.

If you're in the Bay Area, Tony Heyer in Mtn. View can fix it for you, or

Yes, I admit, I don't know everything. I was referring to ORIGINAL Porsche

it says "real Fuchs forged wheels will not break; even in an accident,
they will only bend". This is the caption for the picture of one half of a
broken cast replica.

Anyways, thanks for your tips. I will cherish them as I do your others.

If you'd rather fix your horn, it's probably just some corrosion on the
contacts inside of it. Take it apart, noting what goes where, and inside
you'll find two contacts that vibrate when power is applied. Sand or file
them down to new metal and put it back together. After you reinstall it
you'll probably have to adjust it to get the optimum honk. This is done by
turning the screw on the end where the wires attach, this is a somewhat
annoying  process as the horn must be honked a few times. I'd suggest a
helper to do this ( not a child who thinks it's fun to honk the horn) ...at
least this is what was wrong with the horn on my '89 Carrera.  As for one
wire and two wire connections, on your original horn the ground side is
through the mounting bracket to your chassis . The two wire connection has a
separate ground wire, just run a wire to ground and it should work.

not appropriate for anything but the very early 911s, but Ted seems to think
I recommended replacing cast alloy with steel.
 
While I was at Porsche I would occasionally see broken cars come into the

most incredible shapes, with the tire still holding air, and grass jammed
between the rims and beads from when the tire was flexed sideways while
sliding. I have also seen the ATS "Cookie Cutter" wheels with a big

Hi, Jerry.
 
There is a blower motor in the '84 911 engine compartment that runs whenever
the ignition is on. I think it's on the left side. I think also that it does
whatever it does all by itself, without needing to be turned on by any sort
of A/C switch or whatever.
 
I dimly remember all this because I would hear the thing running on after I
shut off and locked the car; it would go out after a few seconds. One really
cold winter morning in Weissach, I came out to my car and it wouldn't start.
Brand new 911, dead battery. It turns out that the relay for this blower
stuck on, and ran all night. I found the relay, took it to one of the
electrical guys, and he said "oh yeah, that. We had a problem with the
supplier. They got too much rosin flux on the contacts. When it gets cold,
the excess flux gets gooey and glues the contacts shut. Here's a new one."

Beran,

>1) Who makes the best head gasket for a 951 that I plan on having about

As best I can tell, the head gaskets go because of head lift-off.  The
solution for lift-off would be bolts with a higher Young's modulus.
And apparently the Raceware bolts are just such a part.  They've been
around for a few years, and I have found an increasing number of folks
who have successfully used them.

As someone else mentioned, the fellow from the UK firm Superchips is
on the list, and they have a stainless steel head gasket, apparently.  I
meant to follow up with him but have not.  If you or anyone else does,
I'd enjoy hearing more about this part.

Standard warning, like you smart people need to be told this.  If you
overboost the engine, or run the timing wrong or any of a number of sins,
something's going to break.  Head gaskets are cheap and easy to replace.
Holed pistons, burnt valves, etc., etc., are expensive and difficult
to replace.  Think twice before compromising your "safety valve" head
gasket.

I have a problem with the windshield wipers on my '80 924. The wipers will
on occasion just wipe across (without any input from the driver). I think
this is a mechanical problem with the switch inside the steering column. (I
say this because the action happens more often when the turn signals are
on).

Now I thought that the relay might be bad. (I was willing to replace it
because it was easy to replace). A new relay installed but the wipers
wouldn't work at all with a new relay. Dealer swears that the relay is the
right one. Orders another. Same result. 

So I'm stuck with the same old problem.

Now to attack the real problem. How do I get the steering wheel off? Does

Hi Stan, How are you? It's been a little while since we actually spoke . Have
you sold that hot 356 yet?
As you can tell , I am still looking for that original or close to itcar.
This 64 slate/red 64C coupe sounds nice. The original owner has some
sentimental ties which he feel increases the price..It is all original
except:right front fender was bumped out 14 years ago and then they painted
the entire car with enamel. The front nose has some stone chips,but over the
years a spidering of paint to the right and down from the middle chrome piece
has developed. From what I have learned from painters, matching color this
old is difficult and after I have the nose and hood painted, the color will
seem different. I'll most likely get the entire car repainted at a cost of at
least $5000. He wants $19, maybe take $17, that ads up to $22 without any
other stuff. 
I am correct about this paint thing? Does it sound correct about having to
paint the entire car?
I told the owner, $ 15 is more in line. He got a little upset!
63K,rebuilt engine-fresh, with big bore kit.
Thanks for your input

psThis happened yesterday. Perhaps the entire porschephiles should be made
aware:
A young man called me from Lincoln, Neb. with a 1957 silver/red A coupe. It
was all original with only 9,000  miles on it. It had been one of about six
early 356 cars of his late father's collection.He wanted to sell it
quickly,because it reminded him of his father and he also wanted the room in
the garage for his older Nova. He just started advertising and was receiving
many calls to set up appointments. Somehow he got my name, and was more
interested in where the car went than how fast it sold..After talking with me
awhile, he told me  that I was  the one to get the car! However, Some $ would
have to be wired to show that I was interested in the car ($ 100 was asked
for) even though I informed him I would on  a plane from Michigan soon. I
asked for Vin numbers but was't able to contact any 356 people Sat. mid day
to help me with these numbers. My next step was to call up Jeff Conley, Vice
President of the Great Plains 10 PCA chapter in Lincoln,Neb. to seen if he
knew the father or the cars.This is where the SPECIAL Porsche"thing" comes
into play. Jeff jumped into his vehicle, camera and VCR in hand to go see the
 car and to give the owner  the $100 for me. He ended up in a very seedy part
of town with no car found, even after he called for direction himself. It
seems to a long distance Porsche scam. I wonder how many other unsuspecting
Porsche People have sent in their $ 100 just to purchase this ghost car?
Porsche buyers, Beware! 
 Just another crazy happening in my search for that special 356. almost as
good as the 65C coupe with 19K being brought in from Germany by a collector
from his private collection. This call was from New Mexico. I just have weed
out those crank calls.

Subject: Re: 951 head gasket?




Hi all,
I have three questions

1) Who makes the best head gasket for a 951 that I plan on having about
300hp maybe a little more. Done by increasing the boost and a chip.
- -------------------
There are two options for better than stoick - copper gaskets and
"O-RINGS" The latter is $$.  I have, however, heard of people upgrading
the studs to raceware so extra torqueue can be applied and stretching
will be diferent ^&$%.

Sorry top be so vague - call Larry B at Autothority, tell him you want
theior chips but are concerned about head gaskets and he can help you
out..

2) How hard is it to replace a head gasket...?  I have a good set of
tools and I have done a good amount of work in the past but some of the
real technical and electrical info is tough.  ie. I have air comressor
and air tools etc.

You'll need no special tools EXCEPT the belt tension tool (maybe).  If
you really have your SH%T toihether you can slip off the timing belt,
but I'd replace it while I was that deep.

R&R can be done in 4 hrs if you leave it stock.  One trick is to leave
the exhaust header bolted to tyhe head and remove the two as a unit.

Pitfalls:

a) DO NOT rotate the engine or the camshaft after removing the belt.
and before reinstalling.  Bent valves will result.

b) You'll alsop need an extra long 6mm(I think) allen or one with a
narrow socket to get off the cam tower allens behind the plugs.  Best
to
 vuy a 6mm allen and cut off the short end, then stick it in a 6mm
1/4" drive socket.

c) Make sutre you have the LATEST (87+) bolts and washers on the head
studs and find out the LATEST torque spec.  Last time I did it it was
something like 18lbs _ 90 degrees + 90degrees. but it changes.

d) Be careful removing the ater fittings at the back of the head,  Antifgreeze on the clutch will kill it.  Make sure to drain (and blow out) the hear before removal and you'll have a tidier job.

e) You may be able to get away with just a head gasket,  Cam housig
gasket usually is OK, and intakes may be.  Get a good (not Haynes) manual.

3) Suggestions on the proper set-up for a 951 to do 300-325hp with long life.
ie. Chips, boost adj, gasket, anything else?

Replace rod bearings every 50hrs of track use.  Attend church regularly ;)

thanks in advance

Subject: 911. Starting problems

911's with starter engines that does not work seems to be a hot topic again.

It happened to me as well this weekend. It had never happened before
the car went to the workshop for 6 weeks.

I recalled that the earth strap between the gearbox and the chassi
could be a problem and took it as the most likely reason as the left
trailing arm was changed during the repair.


The starter and the ground strap are, however, located on the RH side why  
i don't think the workshop had messed with it. I did find a small bracket
on the LH side near the trailing arm mounting point. The bracket is mounted
to the gearbox. On the bracket there were nothing else than a screw and a 
couple of square shaped rubber bushings. Does anyone know what the intention 
with this bracket is? Probably not the problem, but I am curious.

Well I looked in my private archive and found that Steven Stomski recommended 
changing the ground strap and that a additional starter relay could help.
The relay was sold by Automotion, Performance products and Trak Auto.

Apart from this I would recommend to check your alarm. If it is an alarm 
that cuts the current to the starter this could also be a possible
failure mode.

Subject: 911 Valve springs (Bruce)

I ask about valve springs:
  >there have been problems with after market valve springs and
  >(if I remember correctly) suggests not replacing them unless
  >absolutely necessary.

I went ahead and did them anyway, was told by several people that ARJ
wouldn't sell me the wrong stuff so...

I measured the free height on all the new springs with a vernier caliper.
There was no measurable difference (ie all w/in .001") between any set.
I then measured the old springs.  They varied from .020 to .040 shorter
than the new springs.

Interestingly, when I installed the new springs I found that three of them
required FEWER shims than were originally under the seat to get the
correct installed valve height, and one required .040 more shim.  I can
reason out with I needed more shim, not not less ?  Maybe they were
installed before with too many.

Due to the difficulty of measuring the installed valve spring height I came
up with the following.  On each valve seat I put an index mark on the
outside of the seat, I then used a micrometer to measure the thickness of
the seat and the total hight of the rim, subtract one the t'other to
get the height of the lip *AT THE INDEX POINT* (I'm sure that this is
not a controlled dimension).  Put my guesstimate number of shims in, 
add the seat, valve etc.  Then I walloped the end of the valve stem
with a mallet/wooden drift a couple to times hard enough to unseat
the valve.  I then measured with the butt end of the vernier caliper
from the top of the seat lip at the index point to the top of the spring.

The resolution on the mic and calipers is 1/1000", wonder what my accuracy
was (don't ask what the difference is).  Think it was pretty good, did
each one twice and came up with the same measurement each time.

Filling the ports with parafin showed to leaking.

Probably so.  But the latest news is that the factory has a prototype
V10 engine, and is looking for a "corporate partner" to provide, I
assume, major funding for a '95 F1 effort.  Let's hope they approach
the venture a lot more pragmatically than their most recent F1 and

Dave, so far only one reply.  That from Bruce.  If I only paid $80 the

Not necessarily.  If you're running too rich leaning can produce more
horsepower.  Measured by exhaust gas temp, best power is at about
75-100 deg f on the rich side of peak egt, if you're running richer than
that, leaning it out will increase your power a bit.

Subject: re; theft recovery 1994 C2


     Sorry, I lost the original message and sender; to the person who is
    contemplating the purchase of theft-recovered '94 model for $20k, and
    has the line on another '92 engine and parts, etc, my comments are these;
     1. Assuming theres no structural damage (i.e., no-one took a Stihl saw
        and took the sunroof with it) a theft car can make a fine driver.
        The pain of a theft car is that its easy to disassemble a car if you 
        don't care about putting it back together--eg, it will be a pain to
        replace/repair any brake, gas, a.c. lines and wiring harnesses that
        the thief simply clipped. This can all be done without any real
        compromise to the car, its just a pain.
     2. Your biggest concern is legal; not because of any problems
        guaranteeing good title to the car, but in how you represent the car.
        Since the Motor you'll be getting is a '92, when you are done you
        really don't have a '94 Porsche but a hybrid. That the '92 might
        be an even better motor than the pilfered '94 doesn't matter; if you 
        don't give notice to the next buyer he can sue you back once he finds
        out. Silence is not golden, withholding any material fact that might
        influence the buyer to buy or not buy the car is fraud; and anybody
        who is looking to buy a used $40,000 car probably knows (and can      
        afford) a lawyer who could get back their purchase money and keep the
        car.....
         As long as you put the car back together well, and disclose the 
        history of the car, you should be fine.  But plan on taking some
        discount of what a cherry '94 with no history and records would  
        sell for.

Hi,

I have two questions regarding radio illumination:

1/ Where should the wire of the radio which decides 
between night/day illumination intensity be connected
in a 944 '86?

2/ What is the exact electrical input the radio must 
receive in order to decide between night-time or daytime
illumination intensity? (Please, specify the exact characteristics
of the current i.e. voltage etc...)

Since free height of these springs is not a number I can find anywhere
I don't know what weight to lend to the measurements, but all the new

original springs.

Use the 914-6 master cylinder part # 911.355.012.02 This will leave you
needing a little higher pedal pressure, but with a much firmer pedal
and better feel = easier to brake at the limit.

The earl's (braided stainless) brake line also help improve the brake feel.

Castrol LMA brake fluid is highly recomended for street use.

I just replaced my front wheel bearings with new SKF bearings last week
and was reminded that 914 fronts are the easiest to maintain/replace of any
car I have worked on  -by far ! And as a special treat for 914 mechanics-
you even get to look at them while you work. None of the usual working by
feel an arms length into a tiny hole !

Unless you are replacing the solid lines to the front, no special tools
are needed.

Limited by budget and CIS as far as performance mods go on my '82 SC.
I have, however, been told by a couple of people that advancing the
cam timing to the top of the range, or a tad past it will help the
bottom end performance - recommended 1.7 or 1.8 mm at the check point.
Others I've talked to say that whatever I gain by opening the intake
earlier I lose by opening the exhast earlier.  Any comments?

I also plan looking at ignition timing advances when I get that far.

Subject: 911 2.4S mileage

Steve W. was asking about mileage for his 2.4S, and got some replies that it
sounded low. I agree.

My '72 911S with a totally stock, somewhat tired engine, would religiously
get 24 mpg on my 30 hour trips to Kansas around '85.
We would drive in the 70 MPH+ range (and in 7 trips to Kansas at those speeds
we never got a ticket.)
The 80's RX-7s that I traveled with got the same mileage, but about 80
Horsepower less! Your MFI pump is probably not right if you don't get this
kind of mileage on the highway.

My mistake, you didn't write "history," you wrote "politics" in regard to
KYB shocks.

Again, what the flying F**K does Japanese politics have to do with
shock absorbers? No, dammit, don't answer that, it's a rhetorical
question, we know it doesn't have anything to do with them.
 
>So now you are recommending welding broken steel wheels?  And

Read it again. Nowhere did I say you should weld a broken
wheel. (You're hearing voices again, Ted.) For that matter
when you thump a curb and bend a wheel severely enough to
require sending it out, it's trash. You can straighten it,
but it's still trash.

Yes, Porsche buys the best parts it can, and yes, they are sometimes
Japanese. I think I made it clear that Bridgestone and Yokohama tires
are used by Porsche, and for good reason. KYB shocks are not,
for equally good reason.
 
>They may work on your cars, but you don't drive fast or hard.
 
To answer that, we just need to look at the Candlestick Park results.
You _CAN'T_ drive fast or hard, if first-timers in a 911 T (2.2 liter
engine, all-season tires) whip your ass by 5 seconds on a 50
second course.  You don't know anything about how I drive (nor,
apparently, how YOU drive). We had a Zone 8 slalom on Saturday.
My co-driver beat me by 0.04 sec, for first place, and I beat the
next car down by 0.7 sec. on an 80 second, 1.1 mile course. Five
seconds on a 50 second course is an eternity. If times were
compared, our 356 (steel wheels and all) beat several 911
stragglers. This does not reflect on the 911s, but rather the
distribution of driver skill -- as does your performance at Candelstick. You
can talk the talk, but you can't walk the walk.

Racist? Where? Do you feel my description represents any
particular ethnic group? Do you feel perhaps personally
insulted? (Good). I have found that idiocy  transcends ethnic barriers.
And Japanese origin is not a criterion for quality, KYBs being a case
in point. Some of the best automotive components are Japanese
(see earlier reference to Bridgestone and Yokohama; our car wins
slaloms on Bridgestones, and I wouldn't put anything but Bridgestones
or Yokohamas on it) but the origin of a part has nothing to do with its
quality. One form of racism lies in the automatic assumption that
anything Japanese (or German, or Italian, or whatever) is automatically
superior to anything else.
 
Ninja? You bounce a cycle off curbs too?  Can the wheels be
straightened? Is that the "Ninja crap" you carry in your Acura?
Or are you just carrying spare black jammies and ski mask? Will
an Oakley Thermonuclear Protection sticker fit on the cycle, and
do we need to start a collection for that too?
 
As for accusations of racism, I find such a statement from the person
who called a good number of the list "Nazi sheep" and, a few months ago, made
some comment about being in blackface and therefore resembling the neighborhood
cat burglar to be, as Archie Bunker once put it, a case of the black
calling the kettle "pot."

Ted,

I thought you had a Q45, back from the "Tercel Challenge" days.
So it's Honda, now?  

Stirling went out of business in the US.  Back around 1992, wasn't it?

And in yesterday's Miller 200, the _only_ Lola-Honda that didn't drop out
of the race finished dead last (Parker Johnstone).

The other two Hondas both dropped out (Mike Groff & Bobby Rahal), both
with "Engine Failure", alledgedly the main bearings.  One of Rahal's crew
was quoted as saying "[these] engines can only go 140 miles..."

Kris - I recommend an ENDURANCE race...  :-)

I have fiche for the 928. It came from TMC Publications, (410)367-4490,
for $30. The layout is pretty difficult to follow - it seems to reproduce
whole sections sometimes, with changes, as major revisions were made.
I haven't seen the paper version, so I con't compare. Of course the
911 has much wider range of variation, so it may be completely
different. I might also mention that the pictures are often very
hard to interpret in the fiche version (black and white reversed, poor
contrast range - like a negative Xerox). On the other hand, it's a lot
better than nothing, and I just wouldn't have been willing to pay the
price of the paper version.

1.)  I have a '71 911t targa that just lost its brakes.  Over the weekend, I
learned how hard it is to get the calipers off.  Do I need special tools to get
the bottom caliper bolt off, it took alot of patience 1/8 of a turn at a time
once I finally broke it free!  As was the brake line nut, after partially
stripping it.  I brought my caliper in to work to use an "airline" to get the
pistons out and to borrow a "star" wrench to separate the halves.  Once again I
guess I need more tools and equipment:  Compressor, star wrenches, shorter
sockets, offset wrenches, etc.  Any ideas on how to make this easier, do I need
these special tools?

2.)  When trying to get the "shroud" off, the bolt didn't turn, but the metal
did and it broke at the bolt.  I assume that this shroud is to keep water and
mud off of the rotor.  Do I need it?

I picked up the rear caliper rebuild kits at Parts Heaven for $8.50 each.
Inexpensive!!  Used Durant mirror $20.  Used gear shift knob $10.  

3.)  I also got a used factory 15mm front swaybar (nonadjustable?) for $75.
Good deal!!  The spec. book says that I should use a 13mm if front only and
15mm if front and back.  Can I use the 15mm without a rear bar?

first gear and started up a slight incline when all of a sudden the car JERKED.
It felt like something was locking up in the transmission.  After it happened
I let out the clutch and idled in neutral for a while on the side of the
road.  Started moving from first again and the car JERKED again!  Let out the
clutch again.  Eased it back in and made it back home (a couple of blocks)
without the car jerking again.

Anyone know what may be causing this?  Clutch?  Tranny components?  The
clutch and cable were replaced 10k miles ago.  Could it be the tensioners?
What precludes tensioner failure?

Subject: 911 Leather shiftboot


Hello,

Has anyone ever purchased one of the leather shift boots that covers
the factory 911 rubber shiftboot?  I am interested in one with the
shift knob that comes with it.  That is, a one piece shift knob and
leather boot piece, all in one.  I have seen quite a few places that
advertise these for the 911 (I have an 81 911SC), and would like to
find one that is quality made, not junk.  Is Alan Gun leather (seen
in Excellence) a reputable place to get this item?  Any other sources
that will not let me waste my money?  My rubber shift boot is old and
is falling apart, I need something to replace it, stuff is falling down
into the shifter area, and thought leather may look a little better than 
the factory rubber boot.

Also, when ordering, they say specify color.  My leather interior is
tan in color.  Were there multiple colors of tan for the 911 in 1981?
Such as creme, or light brown.  I just want to make sure the tan in
my car is what Porsche called it.   Sorry for the not so technical, but
more whimpy nature of this post, I just don't want to waste 50-60 bucks on
junk.

Subject: MagBra damage to paint

I have been happily using the MagBra rock guard advertised in the 
classified of the Panorama magazine, most months.  For those not familiar 
with it, the MagBra is pieces of magnetic materiel cut into the 
appropriate shape to put on the front of a 911 hood and just under the 
lights.  The magnetic attraction holds it on.  I like it because it's 
easy to put on and take off, and doesn't flap in the wind. 
 
I've been very happy with it until just this week when I encountered a 
problem.  After a long road trip I removed the MagBra to find that it had 
dulled the finish on my paint.  Now, I had left it on for two days 
straight and when I peeled it off it seemed to have stuck to the surface, 
sort of like it was sticky.  I had also been driving in unusually hot 
conditions, for us above 90 is hot, with lots of hot direct sun on the 
car.  Instructions for the MagBra warn you that if you let water stay 
under the MagBra then it clouds the wax.  I had experieced this and 
thought I could easily fix the problem by removing the old wax and 
re-waxing.  No good, it seems that the finish of the car had actually 
been affected.

I was able to buff out the paint using a very fine polish and decided it 
was because I had left the MagBra on for too long.  However, on a 
subsequent trip I put the MagBra on for only a couple of hours during 
another hot sunny drive and the the dulling had reappeared.

Based on the amount of polishing I had to do it does seem that the finish 
of the paint is somehow being affected by the heat and pressure of the 
MagBra, but to my naive information set this seems improbable.

Does anybody out there know enough about paint to confirm or deny that 
the hot MagBra could be affecting the paint finish?

Does anybody else have such experience with the MagBra?  

Do you think I could alleviate the problem by painting the MagBra silver 
to reflect the sun?

How about regular rock guards? Does the flapping in the wind abrade the 
paint?

Any general comments on rock guards?

Subject: steel wheels and curb-surfing

All this talk about wheels and curb-surfing reminds me of several
related and somewhat amusing escapades involving me, my 914 and
it's steel wheels.  Now remember, this stuff all happened 15 years 
ago when I was truly young, and truly didn't know what I was doing.

OK, for openers, I bought the car at a used car lot.  Being a clever
and concerned prospective buyer, I checked that it had a spare
wheel and tire - it did.  I checked that it held air (by the simple
expedient of testing the windshield washers) - it did.  All is
happiness.  I bought the car. (Turns out it was a rusty,
under-maintained, oil-burning piece of crap.  In 15 years, I've
probably put 25,000 miles on it, but it's been an educational and
generally entertaining experience.  But that's another story.)

Sometime later, I took the spare out for some reason - no, not because
I had a flat.  (There IS a good story, however, in the first time I
tried to use the stock jack - and how far I had to crinkle the rocker
panel before I admitted that, really, I needed to go buy a scissor
jack and find something solid to jack against)  Lo and behold, the 
wheel had an enormous triangular chunk of the rim bent back, all the
way to the bead.  Even better, the exposed inside surface of the wheel
had been ground completely through.  Good thing it was a Michelin XAS, 
the tube held air so the 'washers worked.  I ordered another wheel; 
seems to me it cost $85 Canadian which I thought was ridiculous at the 
time.  I think they are more like $285 now, and a special order from 
Germany thing.

Two years later, I'm charging along on my way to work, and I come to a
point in the road where the street (two lanes each way, with a median
between)  turns 90 deg right.  I'd taken this thing a jillion times,
usually on the outside.  It was fun - the car would take a set, I'd 
stand on the gas, the rear would drift, ever so slightly, and my day 
would be made.  It would usually really freak out the mundanes 
crawling around the inside lane in their Impalas.  

I think this was the year I had added the ADDCO rear bar to my car and 
I was revelling in the twitchy, tail happiness of it.  I'm 
convinced that I'm a better driver today for the car control I learned 
driving that set-up in the wet.  The bar, meanwhile, was tearing the 
shit out of my rusty trunk floor.  

Anyway, once again, I am called upon to embarrass some poor bugger
tooling along the inside lane in his Impala (brown, as I remember).
The problem is, for some reason, I entered the corner 8" to a foot 
outside of my normal line.  It was fun - the car took a set, I stood 
on the gas, the rear drifted, got in the marbles, hung WAY out, and 
mounted the curb and median.  Being the hero driver I was, I drove
down off the median, still comfortably ahead of the guy in the
Impala, and drove to work.  I sure wasn't going to admit to him that
anything out of the ordinary had happened, even if the steering wheel
was pointing left a quarter of a turn and the car felt weird.

I got to work to discover I had bent about 8" of the lip of the rim
flat against the wheel and I had about +2deg of camber on that wheel.
One guy even asked me, "Is your car like a Triumph or something?  You
know - the way their tires point in at the bottom?"  

I had to replace the semi-trailing arm, get the body pulled (tearing 
more rusty metal), grind the cracked bits smooth in the tracks of the 
inboard CV joint (which was over-travelled), ignore the leaking transaxle 
seal, and get the wheel straightened.  I asked "Can you fix this?" at
the wheel straightening place, and they said "Gee, no guarantees, but
we'll try.  We'll heat it with a torch, get under it with a big screwdriver"
(and I thought I was the only guy who used screwdrivers for prybars)
"and bend it out the best we can.  You won't want to use it for a good
wheel, but it would be OK for a spare."  When I got the wheel back,
the lip looked kind of mangled, and a bunch of the wheel was scorched,
but it ran true.  Since it had the same offset as three other wheels,
(the other one had about .5" less offset, don't ask me why) I did the
only honourable thing, and used the straightened wheel as one of my
"good" wheels, scorch marks and all.  

Today, the 914 is in my garage, with one side jacked up, waiting for
me to finish the suspension console repair I started two years ago.
The transaxle still leaks, the wheel is still scorched.  The trunk
floor is pretty much gone.  If I take the 914 ice racing this year, 
one tire will be mounted on my scorched, bent rim.  It's kind of a 
tradition.

Just curious if the owners of a superior automobile purchase superior stereo

I've heard excellent sounds on both MB Quart's and Infinity's.

Subject: Re: SCCA Ride Height Rule  (SMTP Id#: 53

No, that's not the planned method of interpreting and enforcing
the rule, according to Jim Leithauser and Terry Bassett (although
they both will also say that they cannot totally predict what the
SEB will do).

The rule offically says that suspension adjustments for the
"primary" purpose of lowering ride height are prohibited. 
Logically, you are correct, with that wording adjustments that
add negative camber for the sake of obtaining the camber should
be allowed.  And that is probably why Howard Duncan has agreed
(in the Pro Solo rules) that dropping the 914 front end by 20 mm
to get a small amount of negative camber is reasonable -- Howard
seems to be confident that within that small range, the "primary
purpose" of the adjustment is to get camber.  The SEB, however,
is apparently not yet willing to concede this point, although I
keep hoping...

I had Clint de Witt, formerly of the National BoD, ask at last
December's board meeting for clarification of how the words
"primary purpose" would be interpreted.  According to Clint,
Terry Basset explained that the SEB wanted to stop stock 914s
from being lower than SP 914s, and that the expectation was that
ANY lowering was illegal.  Leithauser has told me the same thing,
although he also initially told me not to worry about this rule
affecting my car.   So, unless you are prepared to take a 914,
set to a reasonably-cambered height, to a National-level event,
attract a protest and be prepared to appeal to the SEB as a test
case, we may never know how they will really interpret it.

Speaking of craftsman, I'm looking for a 1/2" torque wrench used, new or 
old style is fine, if it's still relatively accurate.

I'm also looking for some good 15" autox tires, liek 195/50 or 205/50, 
and also a pair of 15" wheels pref. 7" wide, cookie cutters are fine, 
this will be a 3rd set of wheels for me, so I prefer low cost, ugly, but 
straight.

The tires don't need to have tread, unless it's required by the auto-x 
people, it should not have steel showing though...

I'm also interested in some '86 or later rear torsion bars, or some by 
RTR Racing (Stephens Machining), prefer 28mm or wider effective rate.

Martin,

I cannot comment about ignition timing, but I can relate my cam timing
experience on a '78 911SC to you.

A stock U.S. 3.0 liter has its cam timing setup so power comes on in
the higher RPM range. One or two years of the Euro Carrera 3.0's (or
was it Euro SC's??) had cam timing retarded 6 degrees compared to what
a stock U.S. 3.0 liter had. Anyway, I decided to try it this way. The
power did come on sooner, but it was disappointing to see the power
tail of well before redline. I ended up setting the cam timing to the
same settings an '84 through '89 Carrera would use. This provided a
little better low end thatn the stock timing but did not kill the top
end either.

I believe Bruce Anderson recommends this in his book as well.

Hi,

I own a 1987 944S with a 5 speed manual transmission.  Recently I have

happens in all five gears but it does not happen every time (about 1 in 3). 
Also, if I let go of the accelerator I hear the clicking occasionally.  It
doesn't seem to be particularly affected by speed and happens a lot less
often if I let the clutch out slowly.  I've checked the transmission fluid,
its at the right level and doesn't seem to have any metal fragments in it. 
Any suggestions?

My 0.02c
I believe the Sterling was basically the same car as the Acura Legend with a 
more boxy body and up market interior. Hardly exotic and a sales failure in 
the US. Sterling was a name developed for the USA market to try and boost 
it's image. By the way, the long lived Rover V8 was developed from an old 
Buick engine. In my good old days back in England the Rover V8 was a readily 
modifiable and flexible power plant for muscle Rovers (assuming the body 
didn't rust first).

But enough about all these exotics. Let's get back to the mundane world of

This is true of anything made of aluminum or magnesium alloys, regardless 
of how it was manufactured.  The ductile strength of almost all steels is 
VASTLY higher than aluminum/magnesium alloys.  Ever seen an aluminum 
spring? No? How about a Magnesium torsion bar?   Didn't think so.
When steels bend, they REALLY bend.  To demonstrate this to yourself, 
bend an aluminum welding rod back and forth until it breaks, or even 
fractures.  It's easy.  Then try to do the same to a steel one, carbon or 
stainless, doesn't matter.  You won't have the patience.

Little did we know, that Ted's X-ray eyes can discern fractures in metals!
So next time you have a fractured bone, and need a plaster cast, maybe, I 
hope the doctor will also say that you DON'T have a break, he can just 
tell, but that you "did not survive", yet you need _some_ kind of "fixin'".  
If you have that wheel "fixed" and the shop doesn't re-heat-treat and 
artificially age that wheel, just like BBS does, the next time it hits

Pete recommended nothing of the sort, you either can't read too well, or you 
are just desperately searching for something to attack. (obviously)  
Besides, _ask_ any machinist which would be stronger, a broken then 
competently welded, steel part, or a bent and bent back aluminum/magnesium 
version.  He/she will laugh at you, if you make your own beliefs known.  
Aluminum and Magnesium do NOT appreciate this, unless they are heated up 
well past the critical annealing point, to near liquid state.  But then, 
like I mentioned above, they have to be re-hardened if you want their 
original strength and ductility. A steel weld, on the other hand, properly 
executed, and allowed to cool at the correct rate, is DAMN near as strong 
as the original part.  But do not take this as a recommendation, and 
DEFINITELY don't try it at home...

Subject: 944 Shimmy and Shake

My new (to me) 85.5 944 has a has a shimmy at about 60 and again
at about 85.  I would attribute it to alignment, but I also
have an erratic (i.e. sometimes this happens and sometimes
it doesn't) pull to the right on braking.

Any suggestions on where to look? A few more facts:  New Bridgestones
and a recent brake job by the previous owner's mechanic.  My hunch
is that its the right front wheel bearings, but I'm happy to
hear the opnion of people with more experience than me.

I'm interested in finding a good shop in the Northern New Jersey
area to do the alignment, as well as do the timing belts (previous
owner had no service record for them), and diagnose the a/c which
doesn't blow cold air.  Any help on this topic is also appreciated.
Those of you in the Southern NY area can help, too.  I often spend
my weekends in New Paltz, so a shop there would be a good find.

Last question (I promise).  Thumbing through Excellence I see
ads for the Factory Workshop Manuals, with different numbers of
volumes.  Can anyone lend a hand in figuring out what manuals I
actually need? I have the Haynes manual, which is lacking in
many details.

Thanks!

The "secret" part is a little obscure.  Scott and I had an off-line 
discussion on the differences between "trade secrets" and "intellectual 
property" wrt fixin' up cars...

No need to reply to this anyone, but it is my opinion that the parts 
selected for use in production and race automobiles is partially 
influenced by trade relationships and monopolies, not unlike the 
situation where the American company "Go Video" were unable to get their 
product manufactured because of unfair competition.

Forget about KYB for a second, if xyz shock co. made a superior shock 
absorber tomorrow, would Porsche use it in next years model?  No, and not 
in 100 years if xyz didn't market and sell it right.  If what is in use 
is good enough (for the majority), there is no need to change shock vendors.

Is KYB a superior shock?  Maybe, maybe not, maybe just equal, but less 
money for consumers to buy, possibly more money for OEM car makers to 
buy, and maybe impossible for them to buy for contractual/personal 
reasons between the companies.

Pete, Everyone knows LA porsche drivers are a bunch of wussies, doctors, 
lawyers, and drug dealers, probably should be in the reverse order.  If 
you want to race me on any auto-x course in the state with your steel

Sorry if I offended anyone, I just found it amusing how many people 
started following the "wide tires are better" bandwagon, yet only a few 
had any scientific reasoning for it, and of those, some even indicated 
narrower tires could in many cases be faster, for reasons including 
contact patch and faster rise to operating temp.

Look at the following:                                                 
  1) Tire Balance

For your 85/5 944, to acquire the appropriate factory service manual, 
you first need to buy the 924 service manual (4 volumes, I believe) PCNA part
number WKD 481 521, and then the 944 service manual (now 6 volumes, 
WKD 481 821) which covers everything except the 944 Turbo.

A huge investment, but pays for itself the first time you don't screw up 
your engine or diagnose a broken wire.

Subject: Water Pump Woes, or It May Not Be As Bad As You Think


Fellow water pumpers (air-cooled pilots can ignore this msg):

Saturday, just as my wife was pulling into the Galleria parking garage, the
dash lit up and the temperature gage pegged high.  She parked quickly and
called home for rescue.  It took USAA Road and Travel two hours to get me a
tow truck (but that's another story) to get the car home.

On Sunday I took a look.  There was still some coolant in the system but
there was a bunch of fine black powder covering various things around the
front of the engine.  This turned out to be particles of timing belt
removed by the belt slipping around the locked water pump capstan (now you
know why the capstan is driven by the smooth side of the belt).

Now the good news.  On my car with the built-in belt tensioner the water
pump can be removed without taking off the drive shaft pulleys.  This is
because significant portions of the rear piece of the belt cover have
been deleted (largely to accomodate the tensioner assembly, I think).  
After the tensioner, balance shaft sprockets and several bolts have been 
removed the cover moves around enough to get at the pump quite easily.  As 
a result, the entire disassembly only took two hours and included removing 
the radiator (to check for leaks and to flush thoroughly).  Radiator removal 
makes for lots of elbow room for getting at the pump.  I also removed 
the air filter box and front support bracket to make even more access room.  
I found the sprockets easy to remove even without the pin spanner Porsche 
sells for $65.  I merely slipped a couple of pin punches into the spanner 
holes.  They fit snuggly so a flat pry bar between them (like in the Haynes 
illustration, but without the vise grips) could be used to keep the sprockets 
from rotating while loosening the bolts with a box wrench.

Jay Pineau didn't have a pump (the '89 is different) so it was off to Don
McGill (where I expected the ol' "bend over, spread...").  Actually, they 
were quite reasonable.  ESP parts only go to MY 88 but they sold me a new 
pump, with thermostat, gaskets, O-ring and new bolts, nuts, etc. for a 
negotiated price of $185.  Tomorrow it all goes back together (with 
non-phosphate anti-freeze, distilled water, oil and filter change, and new 
timing belt).

ps: Special thanks to Thomas Arman for putting me on to removing the
    tensioner as a complete unit.

I have heard good things about the MB Quart series, but haven't actually
had a chance to audition any myself.  Personally, though, I'm a big fan of
Boston Acoustics.  Their new separates series is supposed to be one of the
hottest currently on the market.  I'm sticking with my factory Blaupunkts for
right now, since to upgrade the system in my 944S will cost somewhere on the
large side of US$2K (I swear 4x6 is *the* most unpopular speaker size ever
used!).  However, I did have a pair of the BA separates (mids in the doors, 
tweets in the dash) up front in my last car, and a pair of their 797 6x9s in
back.  Hooked up to an Alpine head, it sounded really nice.  I'd like to do
the same with my new car, but I think I need some 16" wheels and tires first...

    Oh, yeah--I forgot the "Dave's Big Butt Test" for 914 rust.  Get someone
of large-ish size (230+lbs of Dave seems to work OK) to sit in your prospec-

    Yes.  Well, kinda.  It's easy to use a screwdriver/Swiss Army

Subject: Lug Nut will not unlock and Porsche shops in Boston Area/NH


Greetings,


Thanks to all how responsed to my inquire about weird electrical problems.
It looks like the electrical system has been all screw up.  One fuse is
missing which should control things that work.  I think I want to take
it someone who knows what they are doing to make sure it get back into
good shape.  But at the same time I don't want to get taken either.
I live in New Hampshire but work in Norwood, MA.  Could someone recommend
a good place to take this puppy?

I have also found that I can not get the left front lug nut to unlock.
I notice this after I took it back to the place I got the car from and
the said they had balanced the tires.  I quickly decided that if I can't
trust them to balance the tires, they aint touching my car again.  I may
have been born at night, but it wasn't last night.  Anyway how can I get
the lug nut lock off?  I really don't care if I have to replace the whole
set.

Subject: I've Got Those Water Pumper Blues (944s2 H2O Pump)

My 944 s2 made a vain attempt to mimick its older brother 911 by dumping all
of its nasty H2O out of its block and onto the garage floor last night.  I'm 
sure it was quite catharic, but as we all know, not very practical. At first,
of course, I thought she'd broken her water, but alas, there were no cute little
944's to be found racing about the garage floor this morning.

Anyhows, I pulled the belt cover and was able to trace the source to the back of
the impeller pulley.  I guess this is where the pump "weeps" when the seal/
bushing/shaft start to go.  With only 39K on the car, I'm a bit distressed, but
since the pump pulley is up stream of the cam sprocket and the belt takes up
180 degrees of its circumference I'd imagine it has to deal with quite a bit
of lateral force. The belt having to deal with that extra cam probably makes 
the "load" even worse.  

Does 40K on a late model 944 water pump fall within the range of expected
lifetimes??  Could an improperly installed timing belt (in at 30K) have
led to premature failure?  I understand that there's a spring loaded tensioner
on my '89, but that's upstream of the crank and the pumps between the crank
and cam sprockets, so the number of belt teeth between the crank and cam sets
the tension of the pump pulley, right??? (or am I really confused here).

Obviously, a nice Porsche remanufactered water pump lies in my immediate future,
but I'd appreciate any insights into whether or not an improperly installed
timing belt may have led to premature pump failure (yet still allowed the car 
to function normally for around 9k).

Subject: Exhaust Leak on 951


My 951 has a very slight exhaust leak at the header.  The leak is obvious 
only when the engine is cold.  One mechanic's opinion is that the leak 
should be taken care of immediately to avoid damage to the valves while another 
says it can be ignored for awhile without danger of valve damage.

What's the collective wisdom and experience?  Has anyone experienced 
engine damage due to a leak at the header?

What is involved in replacing the gasket?

Subject: Traffic enforcement

On the thread of radar detectors and stealth bras there was an article in 
last night's paper which began "Preoccupied with violent crime, police 
departments across the nation are writing far fewer traffic tickets 
than they did five years ago - with no discernible effect on safety, 
according to national figures."  The article goes on to state that even 
with more vehicles and miles traveled, both accidents and fatalities fell 
sharply, casting doubt on the belief that police protect the motoring 
public by issuing more traffic tickets.  

Of course we knew that all along.

The only down side to the whole thing is that in the Soviet of Washington
the state patrol is issuing more tickets than ever, the reason, of course
is that they have no real police function, instead being a revenue agency. 

For the more fortunate motorists the article claims that citations for 
moving violations from 1989 to 1993 dropped nearly 11 percent in Florida, 
28 percent in Florida and 35 percent in Texas.  For LA residents traffic 
tickets dropped 44 percent from 1989 to 1992.

Subject: Re: Lug Nut Lock Removal

Darryl,

I assume that you have lost the key to the factory wheel locks when you say
that you can't get it to unlock.

There are two methods to remove the wheel locks:

1) Take the car to a locksmith who will be able to pick the wheel locks for
usually about $5 per wheel.

2) Use the brute force method.  The outer cylinder of the lug nut lock can
be drilled out (that is, the key cylinder can be drilled out) with a 3/8
inch drill. Upon completion of that task, the smooth cylinder can be removed,
revealing the hollow lugnut which can then be loosened as any other lugnut.

I have learned these methods by using them both in my business...

Despite the wide-spread, commonly held misconception that an expert is anyone 
from out-of-town, or the equally misguided belief that an expert is really the

Steve wrote:

......I put the car in first gear and started up a slight incline when
all of a sudden the car JERKED.  It felt like something was locking up
in the transmission. After it happened I let out the clutch and idled
in neutral for a while on the side of the road.  Started moving from
first again and the car JERKED again!  Let out the clutch again.  Eased
it back in and made it back home (a couple of blocks) without the car
jerking again.

- -----End Included Message -----

During  first hundred miles or so after I obtained my '71 E, the car
would also would occasionally do the jerk routine in first gear.  It
was more likely to do this when the engine was warm (near 180 deg.)
This is truly unnerving. All one can do is back off the fuel and craw -
meanwhile traffic behind you is held up and you could easily get rear
ended as you surge forward and then suddenly slow down.

When I took the car in for a carefull going over I asked them to
evaluate and fix the jerking problem. I was informed my left side heat
exchanger was very badly rusted. Since the left side exchanger has a
tube that runs air to the MFI unit, a badly rusted exchanger has the
effect of making the MFI think the engine is colder than it is and the
unit runs too rich.

(For those who are wondering... neither me nor my mechanic think every
 problem on a MFI equipped 911 is due to to a MFI pump problem!)

After a S.S. exchanger was installed, I experienced only one very minor
incidence of the jerks in 1000 miles of driving. I should also mention
the entire top end of the engine was rebuilt and a new clutch unit was
installed as well. However, the car would not idle properly and we agreed
to check this out carefully once the engine had broken in and the
valves could be readjusted. Nothing would make the engine idle
properly. My MFI unit was defective. The idle section of the unit was
non-functional and a P.O. had the middle stage set so rich there would
be enough "spill over" to give the car a marginal ability to idle. They
had also disconnected the wire for the cold enrichment solenoid as
well.  The MFI will be reinstalled next week after a brief journey to a
MFI specialty shop for repair/rebuild.

I do not mean to imply a top end rebuild and completely new clutch
unit/flywheel remachining is required to cure the jerks. My car ran too
rich at idle and between 2000 - 4000 rpm and jerked like crazy
sometimes (especially if one was going slightly up hill). When the
mixture was leaned out this behavior all but disappeared. I'll know in
a month or so if a proper MFI pump eliminates the problem for once and
for all.

'Hope this helps.

Subject: Re: KYB (and other) Shocks


I've only recently subscribed to this list, and the tech talk very 
interesting;

On the subject of shocks and their quality/handling/warranty, can you 
clarify why you think shock brand K is better than brand T? Rather than just 
saying that brand K is the be all/end all of shocks for any application? My 
thoughts:

Quality? Fit & finish (differs from brand to brand and between models); How 
long do they last before the handling of the car is affected?

Best handling? or was that ride quality? a lot of racing cars have 
suspensions that to the average person would appear to be seized solid; 
great for that weekend auto-X, but gets a little tedious as you discover 
every tiny imperfection in the road that few others notice;

Warranty? it's only as good as the manufacturer that stands behind it...a 
"lifetime" warrany against defects typically is only good if the shock falls 
apart in a few miles (regardless of time since purchase); against wear-out? 
I've dealt with dealers who think the only way to test shocks is by bouncing 
the car or checking for leaks; but I've pulled many shocks out that aren't 
leaking and pass the "bounce" test, that have lost virtually all of their 
compression dampening but little of the rebound.

Anyone care to share recent good/bad experiences in selecting their shocks 
or getting them replaced under warranty?

Subject: Measuring exhaust temperatures

Martin,

Recently you said:
>Not necessarily.  If you're running too rich leaning can produce more
>horsepower.  Measured by exhaust gas temp, best power is at about
>75-100 deg f on the rich side of peak egt, if you're running richer

Could you elaborate on this measuring exhaust gas temperature thing? Do you
measure it at the tailpipe (where else, duh?). If so, do your numbers
account for exhaust cooling through the exhaust system? How does the mixture
affect exhaust temperature (I assume richer=cooler)? What exhaust temperatures
correspond with what air/fuel ratios? What temperature results from a
stoichiometric mixture?

It seems to me that internal combustion engine thermodynamics are too complex
for exhaust temperature alone to give you a good indication of your mixture.
That's why EFI uses oxygen sensors in the exhaust stream to determine the
quality of the mixture. Otherwise thermistors would do. I could, of
course, be completely off base with this.

Thanks,

Following a suggestion from Tom Medeiros, I looked in the archives and found a
discussion involving taking apart the two caliper halves of Brembo aluminum
brakes and the problems involved with the bolts.  Do I have to worry about this
with my '71 911t targa steel "m" calipers?
Does anyone know where I can get the O-rings for my calipers(all four)?
I did get replies back that I shouldn't have taken the caliper halves apart
unless I had to because of leaking between the halves.  The Hayne's manual said
to do it, so live and learn I guess.  Oh yeah, no replies about my brake shroud
yet, do I need the shroud?
Thanks, John
p.s. Please provide your much needed advice, just remember it may be you that
i'm behind if my brakes fail sometime.  This hit home as I was reading about
the bolt problem.  This list could actually save my life and yours! A
great resource!

    Umm, actually, I *think* that all of the later (73? +) appearance group
wheels (the "2 liter" wheels) are the forged Fuchs.  With a VW logo on the
inside, as well as the Fox logo...
    And they're (more or less) 8-spoke.
    I'm not completely certain, but I think that the early factory alloys
(the Pedrinis) were also 8-spoke.
    I'll have to look at the Beez-mobile this weekend to see what kind of
wheels the Special Edition came with.  (At least, if the thing is still
on!  No confirmation as of yet...)
    The Fuchs look kinda like "Windmill" alloys, but with square-ish
holes toward the outside.  The Pedrinis have a convex curved shape, and
are typically rather grey with a bit of rough or pebbly surface.  This
info mostly from looking around at a number of swap meets.

Automotion Bashing
    It's a good thing to remember that all of our pricing rules-
of-thumb (e.g., "Automotion is overpriced") can and do have spe-
cific exceptions.  For example:
    One of the front wheel bearings for a 914 is cheaper at
Automotion's regular price than it is at Partsheaven.  Now that
they're running the 20% sale, everything but the grease cap is
cheaper.  And I think it's about 20% of the price the dealer
wants.  (I hope these bearings aren't total crap....)
    There are even a few things that the dealer has a good price 
on.  (I *think*...)
    Just saying, don't rule out anyone that sells quality parts.
(Agreed, not all Automotion's stuff is necessarily quality, but
you can find out what is what...)

I HOPE your leak is a gasket.  I've had three headers for cylinders 2&3
crack, all three in different places, one right at the flange. This is a very
common failure mode in 951's.  There have been at least three different
designs, and all have had problems.  It may be that the flange is warped, and
can be machined flat. I've had that problem too. 
To replace the gasket or remove the manifold, you have to remove the studs in
the head.  I double nut them to get them off.  Better have a supply of new
studs just in case, and ALWAYS use new nuts and antiseize on the threads. To
completely remove the manifold, you also have to remove the studs for
cylinders 1&4, and remove the nuts and bolts holding the manifolds to the
cross over pipe under the car.  It is NOT a fun job.

Good luck.

Ted deserves every lick he gets. He claims to be an expert and actually

Anyway, to address your supposition:

There are two reasons I know of to have 3-piece wheels. One is to
vary width and offset by changing wheel halves. This is important
for race cars and irrelavent for street cars. The second is to
make lots of money selling 3-piece wheels to the public because
they look cool and must be good becuase they cost so much.

You would love my 911SC with 240K miles (1 new paint job about 5 yrs ago).
I drive a coastal mtn pass everyday that is a route for hauling gravel.
My 911 is black with white undercoat (why do they do that!).  I'm due for
another paint job and the front looks like it has white measles.  I loose
at least one light a year also.  But I enjoy driving it too much to worry
about such things and I refuse to wear a bra. :-)

  The carbrella bra is a standard Colgan bra with some coarse foam inside.
I haven't done an A/B test with mine, but my car IS still detectable
at close range by those "Your speed is XX" trailers.
  Speaking to the carbrella company revealed the interesting fact that
they do NOT have their own radar gun to use for testing. The company
supplies anecdotal evidence in their sales literature, but no real
scientific evidence.
  My impression of the product is that it's of the usual aftermarket
quality - not as good as ANYTHING that came on my 911SC when it was
originally built. For example, they use an extra several inches of radar
absorbing foam above and behind the front bumper, so the hood must be
adjusted way up for the latch to work. My bra (!) had some problems with
flapping at the bottom, so I went to the company, which turned out to
consist of a tiny office in the basement of an ancient office building.
They sewed a couple more hold down hooks which have helped somewhat.
  Their guarantee is that they will pay your traffic ticket, and they say
that they haven't had to pay one yet. They do have a rather intersting
limitation on this guarantee, though. During the day, you have to use
additional headlight covers. At night you're allowed to drive with your
headlights uncovered though.
  So Kyle, if I can do anything to help analyze the possible effectiveness
of the bra, let me know...

Subject: 951 NEW OWNER QUESTIONS


Hello Fellow Porschephiles;

Between the flame wars, I have managed to put about 500 miles on my 1989 951 
since purchasing it about 2 weeks ago. I am seeking net wisdom about things I 
do not understand about my new car.  Please bear with me as I did not receive 
an owner's manual with the car, but the dealer has ordered it for me.  I did 
buy the Haynes manual for the 83-89 Porsche 944, but there is almost nothing 
specific to the Turbo model.  Here goes!

1.  I have noticed when starting off in first gear from a stop that the engine 
requires that I keep the revs up or I get a pretty bad shudder below about 1000 
rpm.  The clutch was replaced by the dealer immediately prior to my buying the 
car.  Is this low RPM takeoff problem normal for the 944?  Does the clutch need 
a 'break-in' period before I try high RPM launches?  If I keep the revs up 
around 1500 RPM it takes off happily.

2.  The car has about 38,000 miles on it now.  As far as I can tell, it has the 
original Cam/Balance belts.  The dealer did the 30K mile service on the car 
before delivering it to me, where the belts should have been adjusted.  Is 
there any way to tell, without taking the cover off, if they were really 
adjusted?  If I am going to take the car apart to look at the belts I might as 
well spend the $400 and have them replaced.  (although the car is covered by 
the Porsche Used Car Warranty).

3.  I get a great deal of brake squeal during moderate braking, but it goes 
away with hard braking.  I believe these are the original, stock pads.  I think 
they have yellow backing pads (if that matters).  Also the rotors are showing a 
little wear, but are still in spec.  Is this normal wear/noises for stock pads?  
Its a little disconcerting to listen to the brake squeal when stopping at 
traffic lights.  Makes my car sound like its not well taken care of.

4.  Last but not least, is there a reset mechanism for the trip odometer?  I 
could have sworn the thing was reset to 0 when I got the car.  I will be damned 
if I can find a pushbutton to reset it.  This could cause problems during road 
rallies.

Thanks in advance for any inputs or suggestions.  I will be able to sleep 
better at night if I find that these items are nothing to worry about.  Please 
reply directly to me unless you feel your wisdom would benefit the entire list.

Subject: Lime Rock Driver Ed, 9/22/94

On Thursday, September 22nd, the Hudson Valley Region PCA will 
be hosting a Driver Education at Lime Rock Park, in the 
northwest corner of Connecticut. 

The events that we host are somewhat unusual, limited in size 
to 60 drivers, and running three rungroups (Red, Black and 
Green) providing each driver with at least two hours of track 
time. (Take it from me, this is one of the few events at which 
you will come in of your own volition before the end of the 
session...)  

The fee is $65 if registered before September 6th, or $75 if 
registered between September 7th and 15th. No applications will 
be accepted after September 15th. Applicants must hold a valid 
PCA membership card. 

For first time drivers, fire extinguishers are recommended, but 
not required. A Snell 85 or 90 helmet is required. Your car 
will have to pass a safety inspection (the usual stuff) by your 
local PCA region tech inspector. 

So, you may be asking yourself, why would I do this thing, 
risking my life and my Precious Porsche on a track? Simply put, 
learning to drive well, to anticipate events that are not in 
yourd. 
Increasing that skill on your part will at least help to 
balance your half of the equation. So, come on out to Lime Rock 
for a day of driver education, and help to save a life, maybe 
your own. 

To receive an application, send your snail-mail address to me 
at georgeb@mhv.net.

 - hammer the socket on (the outside of the locking nut is quite soft)
 - put your ratchet/breaker bar on the socket and remove the nut
 - hammer out the locking nut from the socket

This worked very well for me. (the socket didn't break either)

Thanks to all who responded to my original question.  Of the responses I

collecting in the stone guard.  This is exactly the same thing that is
happening to my 944.  According to Karl, Porsche has issued an update to this

different names (or in smaller tubes).  Most of the automotive shops
(and even Locktite distributers) can't even find it in the product listings.

I was cleaning my timing chain housings last night and came across
a possible problem.  There several posts/studs that go through the
back of the chain housing (eg the posts that mount the tensioners)
on the back of the housing is a dollop of hard greyish sealant.  That
sealant is now brittle and lifting/chipping from the housing.  Will
this cause a leak (I'm guessing it will), if so - what's a good sealant
to use here ?  Should I scrape off all the old sealant, or just put the
new stuff over the top ?

Should pick up my manual on fiche in a couple of days - got a very nice

the 149 I spent on a TO bearing and clutch disk the pressure plate
should be around 150.  ARJ was trying to talk me into an aluminium
pressure plate for an additional $40.  This was supposed to give
better throttle response.  I'm all for that, but am concerned about
wear characteristics.  This is going to be a daily driver street car
with occaisional use at PCA track days auto-x etc.  Anybody out there
give me some input re: the wear rate on the al vs. steel pressure plate ?

I purchased the starter relay kit from Performance Products for my 914
(because both of the 914's I've had would not start after stopping during
hot summer and long trips).  Nothing against Performance, but these kits
are really overpriced.  You pay about $25 for a relay you can get at kmart
for $5.99, 3 feet of 14 gauge wire, and 3 wire terminators.  I had an idea
it would be as such when I ordered it, but wanted to make sure I didn't
screw up the connection, and the installation instructions are helpful.

       My own experience on 911 gauges is; DON'T TRY IT ! The chrome trim 
      ring that goes around and seals the gauge is nearly impossible to get
      off without mangling it. Without the special tool it apparently 
      takes, I think your  chances of getting it off (to get into the gauge)
      and getting it back on are nil. 
      
        Especially if your only interest is cleaning the inside of the lens,
      you will be more unhappy with the battered trim ring. Big access holes  
      are available on the dual-function gauges (by removing either movement)
      if you want to clean the inside of those lenses, but if you are
      interested in repair or concours cleaning leave it to a professional who
      has done it a thousand times before....

Owners of all types of cars put in superior stereo equipment.  But to the
subject at hand...ADS used to have a 911 package (separates and amps) for a
price I cannot recall, but was very high ( I don't know if they still carry
it).   I believe it was intended for installation without any cutting. (The
ADS 320i (speakers not the BMW) are excellent speakers but are very pricey
and should fit in the doors of a 911 without cutting.  The higher end
Infinitys are also very nice speakers and availalbe from Crutchfield for
pretty decent prices.  I have not listened to MB quarts, but many car stereo
enthusiasts use and like them.   Polk Audio is another good speaker
manufacturer.  From your message it sounds like you may put woofers in your
doors?  There are some manufacturers that make "small (4") woofers", however
I am not convinced that the laws of physics can be defied, (low frequencies
need to be reproduced by large speakers). For a pure woofer I used to have a
pair of 10" Rockford Fosgates in a removable box, driven in mono.  I
retrospect, I really only needed one and would have gotten equivalent sound
quality.   I suggest putting mids and tweets in the doors and  woofer(s) in
an enclosure somewhere else.  By the way, low frequencies are omnidirectional
so placement is not as critical as the higher frequency speakers. 
 Ultimately you have to decide what sounds best to you.  Use caution buying
what sounds good in the store, because your car has completely different
acoustics than a showroom.   I suggest talking to (not necessarily buying
from )  a reputable high-end car stereo store and asking specifically about
installations regarding 911s. Keep in mind also that stores have different
profit margins for different equipment, don't get steered too much.  On the
other hand, you are referencing and "expert" .   There are also  a few
magazines dedicated to car stereos.  Your local library may have old issues. 
Look for ones that contain installations in 911s.
The addition of a woofer and an amp can make a drastic improvement to any
sound system, even a stock one.  Unless you have the bucks for a whole new
set up, I suggest starting with just that.
Good luck and Happy tunes!!

I'm new to this list and still don't own a porsche but my father runs a 
small airport where I have spent a considerable portion of my life. I can 
indeed confirm that in better equiped small airplanes, mixture is indeed 
set to 75 deg lower than egt, on the rich side. Yes, all piston powered 
airplanes have control for setting mixture; typically next to the 
throttle. In fact, shutdowm is done my leaning the mixture; not by 
cutting ignition. Although some systems 
provide an average temperature, the best indicate temp for each cylinder. 
Measurement is typically provided by an armored thermocouple inserted 
into the exhaust tubing near the cylinder. If I remember correctly, 
stoichiometric would correspond to the peak temp, while the slightly 
richer mixture is recommended for the health of the engine.

Just a short note about ordering parts and the kind of service you can get
at different places.

I recently landed a couple of factory sport seats for may car (thanks Jim)
and needed to pick up the rails for them.  I called EASY in Emeryville,Ca
and got a pair for $30.  A pretty good deal.  They arrived the next day
(I live 70 miles north of Emeryville) and I went to install the seats.

No good.  The rails they sent did not have the notches for the forward/
backward adjustment.  I phone EASY and am told the rails are right,
you also need this special bracket that bolts between the rails and the
floor.  They will send one right out.  No charge.  No problem.

The bracket arrives the next day, the seats go in, everything works.

Great doing business with people like this.  They knew more about what
I needed than I did.  Isn't this the way it should be with all parts
houses?  Give these guys an opportunity to make YOU happy.

Subject: KGB Schlocks


Okay gang,

I've heard enough about KGB (our Russian quality) shocks.  They were and are useless
for more than bouncing in the back row of a drive-in. Questionable even there. 

Quality shock absorbers, Koni, Bilstein, Boge, Carrera and the better grade Gabriel 
and Monroe shocks all take a number of factors into account for performance. The 
primary one is low frequency to high frequency response. These are not speakers, the 
frequency applies to the ability to respond to consistant and random impacts on the 
road surface as well as the normal up-and-down dampening. The named and some unnamed
brands do this rather well. the first two on the list do this exceptionally well, the
others are acceptable for most applications. I have used all and some customs for
racing vehicles and they work. 

KYBs do not. The higher frequency ranges, this correlates to speed, are a true test
of a shock absorber. If you are travelling, say, 85mph and the surface becomes wavy
with the road oscillation  occuring 2 seconds, the shockabsorbers must compensate
for that dampening in addition to the normal road shocks.  In this test 95% of the 
shock absorbers made will fail. Most aftermarket and many OEM shocks fall into this
category. They are engineered to dampen all of the road surface irregularities 
irrespective of the capabilities of the vehicle for road holding and speed. 

The response time to resettle and meet the next road irregularity is controlled by 
the valving and the fluid viscosity. The internal seals play a part, these usually
are what wears first. Heat and wear play a big role in longevity. Use, not so much.
One of the factors that make the listed shocks more superior are the quality of 
design and materials. Koni has a sophistcated valving system on even their least
expensive line. Bilstein has perfected the use of gas to enhance perfomance. And 
so on. 

Many car manufacturers use these shocks to improve handling without many changes 
to the normal suspension of the car. We are very fortunate that the suspension
design of ALL Porsches is so good. The car masks many of the shock absorber 
quirks. Until you drive at high speeds. The use of an inferior shock will cause
excessive bounce in hard corners, float over bumps, bottoming when settling. Of
course, if the suspension is done by Too-Low, the point is moot. Shocks need 
travel to work correctly, if you ride on the bump stops you might as well have 
solid rubber there. If you autocross, the car will want to oscillate when 
entering a slalom or a rhythmic portion of the course. You may not realize it, 
but inferior or worn shocks work against you in these cases.

I will point out, as I have in some other writing, you MUST give you suspension some
travel to let the shocks work properly. If you must lower the car, contact the 
shock manufacturer, Carrera has a great service for this BTW, and tell them 
how you've set it up. They KNOW what your competition is doing and can probably
give you some good information. In the San francisco area, Roger Kraus (510) 886-
4636 has extensive knowledge and experience with all brands listed and many other
specialty shocks. Talk to the experts first, then go out and win.

Mr. Baka, as he continues to point out, is ignorant of this fact. But if you do
not know how to drive you wouldn't understand this anyway.

So much fo my .02 rubles

Subject: 911 Shocks

Lots of mail ostensibly about shocks, but little info about them. I 
thought I'd pass along my experiences.

I've had both Bilsteins and Konis front and rear on my 911, and I chose 
the Bilstiens (yes, I did have to swap the front struts). The 
adjustable Konis, even on full soft (I tried all three settings), had 
too much rebound damping and the car would hop around over bumps 
(bridge expansion joints would turn my wipers on). The Sport Bilsteins 
had a better street ride, and felt better on the track. The Bilsteins, 
because of their upside-down design, basically sieze up when they fail, 
so it is obvious when they do (my 74 had a seized shock when I first 
bought it). The upside down design also means there is less unsprung weight.

I don't autocross. I do know autocrossers who prefer Konis. I don't 
know anyone who runs KYB's.

Subject: Re: 911 MFI adjustment

Last night I adjusted the throttle linkage on my 71 911E with mechanical
fuel injection and it runs MUCH better!

I had had chronic problems with lack of power and
poor response at low RPM (below 2500 RPM or so) ever since I got the
car last year. I first did all the standard tuneup stuff
like ignition parts and timing, but it would still tend to die
if you punched the throttle at idle. You had to kind of gently apply the
gas until the clutch was engaged and it got over 2500 rpm.

To synchronize the air flow, I took off the air box so that the 6 horns
were exposed. Then, with the engine running at fast idle (about 1500 rpm)
I checked the flow through each horn using a Uni-syn flow meter, which
is a simple mechanical instrument that has a nozzle with a foam gasket
that you press against the mouth of the air horn. Flow is indicated by
a clear graduated plastic tube about the diameter of a pencil with a 
little red plastic float that bobs up and down.

The 6 throttle plates are opened via threaded link rods whose 
length can be varied. There are individual link rods for each cylinder,
and there are "master" rods that control all 3 cylinders on each side
of the engine.

I had to make two adjustments: one cylinder had very low air flow, so
I opened its throttle a bit more relative to the others by lengthening
its link rod. Then the two banks (of three cylinders) were not balanced,
so I changed the length of the rod that controlled one whole side
of the engine.

Now when I punch the throttle at idle, the car responds like it should!!
I'm surprised that what seemed like fairly small adjustments made
such a big difference.

One remaining puzzler: I noticed that the car still has a kind of backfiring
or "pfft-pfft-pfft" at a frequency of 1-2 Hz at idle that sounds like a timing
problem. I am pretty sure the timing is ok, though.
It had this problem both before and after the throttle link-rod
adjustment. What is interesting is that it is coming strictly from
cylinder #3 - you can see the float in the flow meter dip with
each "pfft". Compression test shows nothing funny about this cylinder,
also the valves have been adjusted.  

Can any of you offer educated guesses as to what this
might be, and/or how to fix it?  My tentative strategy: check the
timing again, try replacing the plug wire, and try swapping the
injector with one of the other cylinders that works smoothly.

thanks,

Subject: pre-sale 944 questions



I'm Porsche hunting, folks.  That new promotion is making me itch for 
german wheels.

Since the promotion isn't *that* big, I'm looking for a 85.5 or later 
944 or 944S (no turbo, due to insurance hell) around $7500-10K with 
around 50K miles.

I've seen several posts about pre-sale 944 questions, but if summaries 
were posted I missed them, so I hereby promise to post a summary of any 
replies I recieve. :-)

In any case:

I need a good shop in the San Jose area to do a pre-sale inspection and 
annoy endlessly with tons of questions.  Any suggestions?  Geographicly, 
some place between Mountain View & South San Jose would be appropriate.

Currently, I'm looking at a 85.5 944, the problem is, the owner doesn't 
know for sure if it is.  The VIN (from the window tag on the windshield) 
is: WP0AA0948FN451373 Could someone confirm that it is an 85.5 for sure?

Said vehicle is claimed to have 19K miles, what should I be looking for 
to determine if this is accurate?  I'm bright enough to determine if a 
car has 80K instead of 20K, but what sort of things should I look at to 
determine the difference between 19K and say 30-40K?  What were the 
original tires on an 85.5 944?  The front tires are down to about 1/4 
tread (evenly worn) so I assume that they would be the original tires at 
19K miles.

Assuming it is accurate, would $8K be a reasonable amount for it?  The 
various belts (including timing) have been replaced, the water pump was 
replaced and the A/C recharged (all of these repairs ocurred within the 
last few months)  There are 5 or 6 "dings" on the passenger side but 
the paint isn't damaged.  The interior is pretty good, the leather has a 
few small tears, but little/no sun damage.

Originally I had limited myself to a later model (87+) but they seem to 
be few and far between with low miles. (except for one beautiful 88 944S 
that the owner was using the NON-S bluebook value, which of course was 
snapped up within a day or two)

Am I foolish in limiting myself to a lower mileage car (50Kish)?  When 
shopping for my last few vehicles (non german non porsche :-) I've always 
shopped on the philosophy "the lower the miles, the less abuse." any 
advice and/or philosophy?

Any other tidbits of 944 knowledge I should be carrying around with me in 
my search?

Thanks for reading my long post. :-)

asked him if the hub was worn, and his response was, "What, does everybody
think we have junk now?"  I told him I didn't mean to imply that, but...
"I know, you just want to tell me what to look for.  We have highly
trained professionals who have been doing this for a long time."  Okay,
fine, I gave him my Visa number and let it go.  Yesterday the fan arrived
at my apartment, and I picked it up from the office this morning.  I was
impressed by the response time.  However, when I looked inside, the fan
had six large holes around the hub, not the 12 mine has.  In other words,
it's for an earlier model car, with a larger pulley, which will turn
slower and provide less cooling air than the engineers in 1980 decided my
engine should have.  When I called Robert back, he seemed to still have a
problem with customer service.  I told him this was the wrong fan, and he
insisted it came off an '83 SC out back.  He said they would refund my
credit card when I returned it.  When I asked if they could get me the
right fan, his response was a curt, "No".  I explained that I had been
dubious of their service due to responses received on this list, and he
asked me where I was from.  I told him my name and he looked it up on his
computer, saying something to the effect of, "Oh yeah, North Carolina,
that makes sense."  Anyways, I have no need to continue doing business
with such people.

Be warned,

Subject: 951 Starting Problem

I have a 1986 944 Turbo, with 60,000 miles on it.  Ever since I bought the
car 4 years ago, I have had an anoying problem with it not starting when
1 have..
	1st, driven it for a while,
	2nd, stop and turn it off for at least 30 mins,
	3rd try to start it again.

It will crank, but just not start.  I can hear the fuel pump running.

It always starts eventually, but sometimes it takes 5 or 6 minutes.

Any ideas out there?

martin,

	loctite 574 is a 'special' product in that loctite makes it only for
Porsche and it is only available in the 50ml tube (the 'like, 30 
engines' size).
at least that's the story i got from loctite when i went through this a couple
of years ago.

	when i first ran into this situation, i called loctite and asked their advice
on what might make a reasonable substitute, one that i could buy in the little
5ml (?) tubes. what they suggested was 514, i think. if you're 
interested, i can
check at home (i still have most of the tube) and make sure of the number.

	anyway, that was my solution to the problem (in my case, how to
put the cam belt tensioner pivot bolt back on a 928, without causing a leak,
or spending $30 on a tube of goo, of which i needed maybe 6 drops). i don't
really have any technical information of what makes 574 so bloody special.

Subject: Catalogue HELP!!

Fellow Porschephiles,

I'm about to join the madness and buy my very own 911.  I'm seriously looking
at a '73 911S targa that is for sale locally. I'll tell you all about it once
I'm in actual possession of it. I already noticed some things that need
replacing and started making an estimate on the parts I want to buy. After
having gone through all the catalogues (Stoddards, Automotion, Tweeks, etc.)
 I noticed some great price disparities. For example,

73 rear bumper guard, left or right (the rubber is somewhat cracked)
Automotion     $129.95
Stoddards         $177.80
Tweeks            $135.00 

Turn lense. left front is cracked
Automotion     $119.95
Stoddards         $72.25
Tweeks            $62.50

Can anyone tell me why there are such large price differences between the 3
companies. I would think that if one company is more expensive than the
others that it would be consistent, but in this case Automotion is both the
cheapest and the most expensive. Are there quality differences in the above
products that would explain the difference.  If there is no difference, I
will buy the bumperguards from Automotion since they are having a 20% off
sale. If anybody can help me, I would be greatly appreciative.

Thanks,
Neil Kumpers

Subject: Early 911 Suspension & Alignment ??s

Anyone running the new 230 series BFG R1s on an early 911?  I've got a '70
911T and I just switched from the older 214 series and find that what was
once a very neutral handling car now understeers like a pig.  Since the
motor is still a standard 2.2T with a 135K miles (albiet with Webers and a
Bosch distribuitor from a '68 normal 2.0L) I rely on the handling to make
up for the lack of raw horsepower.  Needless to say, I wasn't expecting my
new shoes to make me run slower (and I know it couldn't be my driving :-)
).  I thought I'd toss a plea for help into the listserver and see what
happened.

For a little background here's a description of the suspension and the
settings that worked great with the 214 series R1s:

Front   205-50/15 on Fuchs 6x15
          pressures: track 23 cold, autox 25 cold
        22mm Sway-A-Way torsion bars
        19mm H&H sway bar set to position 3 of 4 (towards the stiff side)
        Weltmeister adjustible drop links
        0 deg toe
        -1 deg 30 min camber

Rear    205-50/15 on Fuchs 7x15 late offset - not R :-(
          pressures: track 25 cold, autox 27 cold
        27mm Sway-A-Way torsion bars
        16mm Weltmeister sway bar set approximately to 50%
        Sway-A-Way adjustable spring plates
        +10 min toe
        -1 deg 30 min camber

Knowing that the 230s need less negative camber than the 214s we changed
the alignment to (read in inches on the new machines - which brings up
another question, how do you convert degrees to inches for new machines
anyways?):

Front   0" toe
        -1.25 deg camber

Rear    +1/32" toe
        -1.25 deg camber

It looks like it's still too much negative camber however.  A pyrometer
shows about a 15 degree F increase in temps from the outside to inside
tread.  The current plan is to go to -1 deg camber in the front and
possibly a little toe out.

Any suggestions/comments?  Any constructive input appreciated as I've got a
Zone 12 autox in about 2 weeks followed 2 weeks later by a couple of days
on the Sebring new course so I'd like to get it dialed back in before then.

The water pumps fail at seemingly completely random intervals.  I replaced

gone another 55K or so without a peep or a seap.

     I believe the original paint is Glasurit from Germany.  I know where 
     to get it here in the Bay Area.  It's going to cost about $350 (I know 
     because I'm about to do my 911 with it).  It is very tough, hard and 
     long lasting stuff.  I heard that Mercedes also uses Glasurit.  
     Incidentally, my 356 also has Ruby Red Glasurit on it.
     
     Also, heard similar good things about a paint called Speedsecker (this 
     is probably the incorrect spelling) also from Germany.

You use the "other" sealer -- it's either Locktite or Wurth, it's
green, and this is where I wish my memory wasn't organized hoographicly.
I can tell where in the shop the bottle is, and where on the page the
product is located in which binder, but can't bring to mind the manufacturer
or part number... Ken? Bruce? Kevin?

Oh -- and this is also where you use the little buffer wheel gizmos you

Subject: car speakers

IMHO you get more bang for the buck with Boston Aucostic speakers. 
However I hate having the speakers mounted in the doors. I can hear the 
music going across my knees. Z Box (Classic Research) makes custom 
enclosures for 911's ( and a bunch of other cars). The enclosures I had 
in my 73 911 was a pair of front satellite speakers located by the kick 
panels (when they were carpeted they became invisible) and a rear 
enclosure that mounted behind the seats which contained 2 8" woofers 
pointed up and another pair of satellite speakers pointing forward. The 
left front speaker and the right rear speaker represented one channel and 
visa versa. This put all the music right around your head instead of by 
your knees. What I didn't like about the Z-boxes were the speakers were 
pretty louisy. I took the stereo out when I sold the car and I'm in the 
process of mounting most of it in my 930. What I'm doing this time is 
retaining the front satellite housings and replacing the speakers with 
Boston Acoustics. I took out the back seat and made an enclosure and 
mounted 2 8" woofers with the speakers facing the back of the front seat 
instead of up. The amps are mounted under the passenger seat( harder to 
steal). When it comes to the cassette or cd player I suggest the audition 
them because they all sound different, then pick the one you like the 
sound of. I would buy the deck without a built in amp and add the amps of 
my choice, or at least make sure the external amps bypass the built in unit.

Same here...

First off, *BELIEVE* Jim Pasha. He's right. 

Second, that's not how I handle things... I make a *BIG* distinction
between how I handle the race cars (I engineer and maintain things so 
that they CAN NOT fail and cost me a race) and what I do for street
cars.

For the race cars, I either use Bilstein, Koni or Carrera coli-overs.
I have looked at Fox, Penske  and a few more exotic things for
special one-off tube frame racer stuff. I prefer Bilstein if I'm
using a "conventional" shock. And I always use custom valving. And
no, I won't tell you what it is.

I run Konis on my 356SC. I have *ALWAYS* run Konis on my 356s.
For the purposes of the following discussion, you can play like
the 356s are not "street cars"... (I also use Konis on my BMW R90/6
but that's another story)

For my street cars, welllllll.... I use KYBs. My old 1.8 914 that
Tad Haas is doing so well with has KYBs. My 911SC has KYBs. I just
change them every two-three years. I *LIKE* the "Gas-A-Just" feature
that makes the shock "pump up" with each additional excursion in the
same delta t -- it's like having someone ride in the trunk and turn
the knob to "stiff" as you go through slaloms. 

So, what does that mean? I dunno. Does it mean I don't know what I'm
doing? There are more than a few people that might contest that... Does 
it mean Jim Pasha is wrong? Absolutely not -- remember, I started off 
telling you to believe him because he's right!  So, what???  I'll let 
you make your own interpretations.  And your own decisions about what 
shocks to buy.

Ted,

Buy good Spring compressors (you need two), preferably with three 'fingers'. 
If you buy the one with only one 'finger', changes are it will 'jump' off 
and slam you in the face........ Ehemm,....asurre you're buying the 
compressers with *ONE* finger,......  (...just kiddin'....)  ;-)

Drive one of the front wheels upon a wood block 2"x4" or 4"x4". Have a 
friend to sit carefully on the front fender as you put the compressors in 
place *BEFORE* you start unscrewing any bolts. When the compressers are in 
place, tell your compadre to lift his ass, and jack up the car. Remove the 
wheel, unscrew the strut. That's about it.......

So Ted, change your shocks, prepare your car, and practice......! Unplugg 
that Nintendo pack, throw away the 'Chase HQ' or 'Nigel Mansell GP' 
cartridge and 'taste the tarmac'....!

Nah. I'd rather have Sigourney or Michelle Pfiefer.  Either would be
helpful with the door closed.

Actually you want a place for tires and, if possible, a generator as
well as lots of secure shelving for spares.

Another thing that's nice is a small "cabin" area, with A/C and a
microwave.  Thiks can save $$$ in hoptel costs, and isn't bad with
either of the above appliances.  Or both. And the A/C or micro would be
nice too!

on a related note, I'm considering replacing the system in my 82 911.
I'm considering a Blaupunkt Lexington in dash am/fm/cassette/cd controller
with infinity speakers in the door and rear deck.  I'm planning on
a disk cd changer, either the blaupunkt cdc-m4 or the sony cdx-u404.
The blaupunkt is 13.4" w x 3.5" h x 7.25" d and the sony is
12.25" w x 3.5" h x 7.5" d.  Will either or both of these units fit
under the drivers seat ?  If I decide to add an additional amp (probably
wont since the radio amp is reasonably high power but ...) where is
a good place to locate it ?

Subject: 911T 2.4 engine - to buy or not


Hi folks

I have just heard of a 2.4 911T engine up for sale.  The owner is a club
racer and unfortunately his car was written off (T-boned).  This is the
engine he is selling.  It was rebuilt last year (I think) and is giving stock
performance as required by the class he races.  The engine comes complete
with 'box.  I should be able to see the engine running in the wreck.  So any
opinions as to whether this is a good idea or not ? ie is an ex racer engine
bad news, is a T engine no fun compared to an E ...  (I want another engine
for my '72 911E so I don't loose use of the car whilst I rebuild its original
engine).

thanks,

Subject: Second try: ring-gap question


Hi all,

I posted this one a while back and came up empty.  Of course, there was a 
fast 356 war (or was it a bent wheel war?) going on at the time, so it 
probably got lost in the smoke.

Question is:  I'm replacing pistons in the 931.  The new set comes with 
rings installed.  Can I install these new pistons as is, or is it likely 
that the ring end-gaps will be out of tolerance?  I'd like to avoid having 
to remove and then reinstall all the rings just to check the end-gaps in my 
cylinders, but I'd like even less for one of these puppies to crack because 
the gap is too small.  What do you engine builders out there think?  Can I 
trust Mahle to have installed properly sized rings on these pistons?

This is not specifically about Porsches, but it's something we can all use
for our tow vehicles and "other" cars.

I have a newish Grand Cherokee V8 daily driver/tow vehicle. I don't want the
undercarriage to get all ugly and rusty like they all do after one year in
the northeast. I want to coat the suspension, axles, and other non-painted
parts with something that will keep rust and ugliness away. I plan on
steam-cleaning or wiping down with paint thinner first.

There is a spray from DURO that is some type of rust reformer. Anyone ever
tried it? Or I could use some type of oil, but then it gets real dirty. I
could try paint, but I'm sure it wouldn't last long.

Anybody with any good ideas, please help. Thanks,

I have the other one that he will buy cheap if he can find another. These
original A008R tires are one of the best handling tires ever made.

- --Tracy, from new (25 miles on odometer) my '87 has behaved about like you
describe. At 50,000 miles (original clutch) it is perhaps a bit worse due to
wear. Seems better after clutch lining warms up after a few starts. Never my
first choice for a car to take into town. Much better on long trips or track
(i.e lots of fun miles per standing start). 1500 rpm starting revs sounds
about right. YMMV.

- --Net wisdom seems to be to replace belts every 30,000 miles. However, when
examining mine (replaced at 30K and 50K miles) they showed virtually no
visible wear. I would be inclined to wait for the water pump to start leaking
or making noise, then do them all at once. This could well happen to you in
the next 10-15,000 miles. I would now treat a small coolant leak (visible as
a track on front of engine crankcase when doing oil changes) as  a sign to
replace the water pump. I ignored the leak and my H2O pump seized up without
(additional) warning on the highway.

It is in your owners manual (picture is better than words), but look at the
central fresh air vent, left side, for a horizontally ribbed section of the
vent vanes. Push to reset (it is electric, key must be on on my car).

Welcome to the capitalist world, Comrade. As you will soon discover, you
have to make a choice: either shop *EVERY* part you buy and potentially
wind up paying a ton more in shipping than you save on the parts, or 
establish a relationship with one or two highly competent vendors and do 
business with them pretty much exclusively even though you "know" you could 
get at least some of the parts cheaper somewhere else.

It's just the way things work.

Jim,

The paint that Porsche uses is Glasurit. I'm not sure about cost,
but Stoddard's used to carry it so you might start there.

As for "collectability", I also used to be concerned with this
subject, that is until my wife started making comments about my
"garage furniture". I drove my '73 911T sparingly, as I had the
body restored and it looked great. Now, after some self-inspection
(philosophical, not physical) I drive my P-ship daily, headlights
flopping in the breeze (yes, I go braless), a patina of rock chips
gracing its leading edges. The point? Porsches were meant to be
driven, not collected, unless of course you have wheelbarrows full
of money, in which case I would collect Porsches to drive. End of 
speech.

On a more mundane tack, my rear view mirror was set back in too 
high when I had my windshield replaced. Could anybody please tell me
the best way to remove it so I can lower the mount. Thanks

I'd start with a Wells Cargo 24' trailer, add a generator, compressor,
workbench and "enough" tools. Tire rack mounted to put the weight between
the wheels and the tongue, for say 8 tires minimum. I'd put a winch 
on it so I could pull the car into the trailer rather than having to
push it. I'd also add the obligatory fridge and water cooler, maybe a
microwave (no, probably a microwave).  I'd carry some lawn furniture,
have an awning made that extends from the top of the trailer, and I'd put 
an R/V A/C unit on top so I could roll the car out under the awning,
close the doors, and chill out.... 

Now if I can just find time to *USE* it...

Subject: Dealer parts

I, too, have to admit, there are times when dealer parts prices are good.
My husband and I have a 1973 Carrera RS.  Over the years, it had been
converted from original touring specs to lightweight specs.  We want to put
the car back to original.  Two main differences in the versions is that the
touring version has rocker panels (lightweight has none), and steel rear
bumpers (lightweight has fiberglass).  We checked LOTS of parts sources and
had miserable luck:  only once did we find the bumpers, never the rockers,
and the price was way out of line.  Knowlegeable people kept telling us we
wouldn't find them, or we'd have to morgage our house to get them.

So, my husband called Howard Adams at PCNA to ask if he knew any sources.
Well, he had the rockers IN STOCK, and the bumpers could be gotten from
Germany whenever we wanted them.  And the prices were very reasonable.  No
house morgage necessary.  We had the rockers in 3 days.

One added benefit.  My husband sells Acuras at a dealership that also sells
Porsches, so we got a 20% discount on the parts!  (We also got to borrow an
NSX for a weekend, but I'll save that story for later as my Nomex suit is
being cleaned ;-) )

Even without our discount, the dealer parts were the best alternative IN THIS
INSTANCE.  Certainly, I wouldn't buy all my part there.  EASY is on the top
of our list for used items.

Before you repaint you should try a cleaner, polish, or glaze on your
current paint.  The new paint will never be as nice as the original
and will not weather as well and probably will not match.  And I have
a 4-color guards red 1983 944 to prove it.  I have been using Meguiars
#3, #7, and #20 on my car since it was recommended by a body shop that
did some work on my car.  There are lots of different products
available which have different levels of aggressiveness in cleaning

better results.

On 6/24/91 I placed a phone order with Kempton Bros.. I have attached the

number corresponds with a Purolator oil filter. I received Mann oil
filters. After receiving the order I called back on 7/2 to explain that I

for my car. I also explained that I recognized Mann as a "reputable"
manufacturer but preferred for many reasons to use the original equipment
filter. I was told that I would receive full credit of $60 for the return
and was given a return authorization number.

On 7/9 I returned the filters. On 7/17 I received a letter stating that a
$48 credit had been given to me. On 7/18 I called to correct the mistake
and talked with Robert Kempton (presumably the less diplomatic of the
Kempton brothers). He told me that the filters were exactly the ones which
he had intended to sell me (a point that I had never disputed with him) and
that while he had originally said that he would give me a $60 credit, he
was now going to give me only $48. Further conversation yielded nothing
except his abuse and insults. He seemed to infer that I should be happy to
pay him $12 for the privilege of sending him back something that I didn't
want. I told him that the conversation was going nowhere and that I was
going to let VISA settle it. He hung up.

Complicating this matter is Kempton Bros.' return policy. It does not
appear in their ad (see attached ad) nor was it ever mentioned to me when I
placed the order. The only notification I received received was with the
delivered package (see attached notice). I originally indicated (during my
7/2 phone call) that I would accept a store credit of $60 but I feel now
that only a credit of $60 to my VISA is acceptable. I do not want a store
credit as I will never again order anything from this place!!!

That is the description I get from the Porsche guys and from AJR.  It's
an orange anerobic sealer.  That's what Bruce calls out for.  The bottle

No.  Frequently, the *dealer* will have the best price.

Examples:

Warm-up regulator for 1980 911sc: 
   List price from dealer: ~$300 (in porsche box)
   Automotion: ~$200
   Best price spotted in Pano: $160
   Price from dealer going through 3rd party: $142 (in bosch box)

Cold start valve:
   Automotion: ~$90
   Dealer: ~$50

At this point, I *always* get a quote from the dealer first.  Lately,
I've been buying everything there 'cause it's cheaper.

There are exceptions:

Factory expanding oil return tubes are cheaper from automotion 
than from the dealer.

It helps to get to know the parts people.  Generally, they have 
considerable latitude regarding what prices they charge.

Many dealers give a discount if you are a PCA member.

Subject: Re: 911 MFI adjustment

Hi, sorry to be cranky, but you've screwed up the correlation of your
engine.  You really need to get the Bosch MFI manual to see how it's done.
I can tell you where to get said manual, or make you a copy of mine if you
wish.

1: You shouldn't drive the car below 2000rpm (besides starting from 1st) -
   it'll have no power down there.  That's what the owner's manual says (RTFM).
   On my S engine, the power doesn't kick in until 4000rpm or so anyways.

2: The linkages on the individual stacks should be a loose fit at their
   stops, i.e. no pretension.  The stops are set when the stacks are calibrated
   (mine have paint on the screws to keep them from being messed with).  If you
   want to adjust the idle mixture, use the idle air bypass screws at the base
   of each stack and not the linkages.  (There's also an idle mixture screw on
   the pump, but you really need a CO meter to adjust this one correctly).
   But assuming that it is set correctly, it should be safe to adjust the air
   bypass screws with the goal of cylinder balance and the correct idle speed.

3: Did you adjust the valves before you did this?  That could make a big
   difference in relative air flow between the cylinders (as well as
   performance).

   Pat, no special tool is needed to pull the CIS injectors, just pull them
 out. As long as you don't yank on the fuel line you can't hurt mcuh, just
 use common sense. I've had luck prying under the side.
   Getting them back in is harder, lube the gasket with oil and use steady
 pressure (put the seal on the injector, not in the plenum tube). Don't hammer
 them in from the top, you'll screw up the threads.
                                                                             
  If you don't know if the injectors have ever been replaced, you should just 
 as maintenance (your car -is- 21 years old, after all). The CIS injectors
 are pretty cheap ($150 for the set), there is just so much soaking them in
 cleaner can do.
   Before I've tried testing whether an injector is "good" or not by watching
 the spray pattern (push on the air-plate while the injector is out), but 
 later learned they really only cut-on in a vacuum (as when the intake valve
 is open and the piston drawing down; my previous misconception is that they
 constantly filled up the intake--and I couldn't imagine how atomization 
 occurred). So I think the obvious spray pattern test really won't tell you
 much.

Tracy,
I hope I can help. Here goes....


#1 CLUTCH: This shuttering is not normal. If it is a new clutch as you
           say, someone probably did not do the job properly or it is
           the original clutch.

#2 BELTS: As for as I know, there is not any way to check belt tension
          without tearing down the front of the engine.
          IMPORTANT!! Make sure these belts are properly tensioned!
                      This should always be done(belts replaced when
                      change of ownership occurs) that is if you are
                      not "certain" they were changed at the proper maint-
                      ience interval.
#3 BRAKE SQUEAL: I have the same problem on my 86' 951. It is possibly
                 uneven pad wear, eneven rotors, caliper alignment
                 Some brake squeal is normal with certain pads. The
                 noise I get is more of a rubbing sound, and it does
                 disappear with hard pressure to the pedal.This is not
                 normal. Let me know what you find out on this.

#4 TRIP ODOMETER LOCATION: It is concealed rather cleaverly in the
                           leftmost side of the large oval airvent.
                           Look you'll see it.

Subject: 8 yr old Tires. Replace? With What?

My 924S has 195/65VR15 Pirelli P6's with an 86 date on them.

With the exception of some small cracks parallelling the tread, they look
fine. There are no cracks on the sidewalls. Plenty of tread left. 

Nevertheless, the risk of them some day going POP or perhaps a desire to 
improve handling has me thinking about replacing them. In September I 
will be moving from So. California, an extremely dry climate, to Atlanta,
which is a wetter climate with almost zero snow. It will not get driven
in snow or ice, but rain is inevitable. So I am thinking I need some tires
that are ok in rain.

The tire place had two pirellis can't remember if it was P600 and P6000 --
or if it was P6 and P600. Anyway one was high performance and the other 
"ultra" performance. They wanted to sell me the ultra because they are better
in rain. They cost $10 more per tire. 

I'd rather get the net.opinion. Lets not argue the tire width stuff again.
I don't race but do enjoy driving the car hard occaisonally. I want 
excellent braking and cornering when dry, ok when wet (given the inevitable
laws of physics of hydroplaning,etc...), tread life 20000 miles or more.
Cost matters, but $125-175 each is ok. 

Do not intend to replace factory phone dial wheels, so guess I need to stick
with the original size. If you had BAD experiences , I'd really like to know
what to avoid. 

Is this a good time to do anything else? (Repack/ Inspect CV joints, new
brake pads, shocks, etc...). In the sense of saving money by reducing labor.

I know any place can do my tires -- but was suprised the local dealership 
where I get repairs told me that any good tire store will do the same thing 
they do ( not suprised by level of service but by level of honesty ).

The net has been pretty helpful with stuff so far. I've put about 6000
miles on the 924S now, and the Mobil 1 is a lot better than that Castrol 
20W50 stuff. I'm not losing any of the Mobil 1 with abt 3200 miles of use on
it now and abt 800 miles of that at 80-100 mph.

   I think Porsche still used Glasurit paint, made by BASF in Germany, and    
  used by Mercedes, Porsche, and Ferrari as OEM paint. It  really is knockout
  stuff, though I've just started using Deltron from PPG (jury is still out
  on which is better, I only paint 2-4 cars a year, real painters would have
  firmer ground to base their opinion on).
   Any paint store might carry Glasurit, it doesn't compete head-to-head
  with PPG or DuPont so stores who carry either may carry Glasurit. Price is
  pretty reasonable, about $30/quart for the paint, an equal amount for
  hardener. Either paint would work well, you'll need about 2 quarts if all
  you want to do is deepen the clearcoat.
   Bob Spindel (another P-netter) has sent me mail, he has tried PPG Concept
  2020 Urethane clearcoat with an accelerator, DXF7 "Supercharger," and was
  apparently very pleased with the quick dry time of the paint (which is
  critical for us guys who move the lawnmower out of the garage before we
  paint)...

>Third: What if any collector value is this U-boat gonna have.....
     Try none, your 924 won't EVER be a museum piece.  In my opinion, the
 car will depreciate to where maintenance costs will overwhelm its worth
 (uh, just like "real" cars) and eventually you'll throw it away.  In the
 meantime, though, I think it would be a really fun car to drive, cost
 comparable to buying a new Hyundai but a lot cheaper than buying a new 
 Prelude.

>Farfegnuegen my butt!!

     1. Life really IS a bitch.
     2. Some things make it all worthwhile anyways....

Subject: 914 wheels, the true story

	
	OK, here's the reality of 914 alloys. Info from 914 & 916/6
restorers guide to authenticity. (B. Johnson). The descriptions are 
based mostly on the pictures in the book.

Standard wheels:

'70-'73 standard wheels: 15 x 4.5 steel
'73 modified centers with a bigger hole
'74-'76 15 x 5.5 steel with a large X in the center

Optional wheels:

'70-'73 Appearance group
	15 x 4.5 steel with larger offset (again mod in '73)

'70-'73 8 spoke Pedrini cast Alloy 15 x 5.5, modified with a larger
	center hole in '73. no emblem on the center caps.
	The 8 cooling slots on the perimeter. ribs up the "spokes"
	go straight to the lug nuts on 4, and continue to the
	center hub on the alternating spokes.

'73 Appearance group. 15 x 5.5 Fuchs forged alloy. A big X, enclosing
	4 of the cooling slots is raised and polished. this goes
	all the way to the center hub. lug nuts are in the recessed
	section outside the big X. - Kinda similar to Fuchs 911 wheel.

'73-76 as an option the forged Fuchs above was availiable.

'74 Special Edition 15 x 5.5 Pressure cast Mahle.
	These are 8 spoke (or 8 slot) wheels. The spokes, and the
	ribs down the center of the spokes, are of equal length.
	This differs from the Pedrini wheels where the ribs down
	every other spoke form an X in the center of the wheel.
	The centers were painted to match the lower rocker panels
	on the Special Edition cars.

late '73 - 76 15 x 5.5 Pressure cast Mahle. Availiable as an option,
	These are the same as Special Edition wheels only the finish
	is matte silver and the centers were not painted.  All '73
	Appearance group did not get this wheel, but rather the Fuchs.


All steel wheels used a VW lug bolt.
All alloys used a special Cadmium plated lug bolt.
Modification to the front hubs in '73 resulted in larger center
	holes on all wheels.

Subject: Alignment after lowering


Hi Gang,

With several notes on ride height, got me a thinkin'.  I lowered my '79
928 by installing Eibach springs.  After doing so I noticed it pulled to the
right.  Had it aligned but still noticed it pulled to the right.  Went
back they said that it is set to the factory settings.  Cured that problem
by rotating my tires.  I didn't want my tires rotated because they were
just rotated, so I put them back.  A few weeks that way the car didn't
pull either direction. 

Should I worry about maintaining the factory settings for a lowered 928? 
Do I need to make corrections?  If so does anyone know what the
corrections should be for a 928 lowered about 2-1/2 inches?  Any
information would be greatfully appreciated.

Help!!!

While driving yesterday, revving from 2nd to 3rd, my engine went dead.
No noise, no sputtering, it was like there was no juice.
No loose wires, no blown fuses.  I have NO idea why it suddendly stopped.
Cranks ok, but wont stay running for very long (3 secs) before dying again.
Today it wont turn over at all.

I'm looking for ANY ideas...I dont know where to start. I'll check rotor
and dist cap. Everything in ignition system is new except coil.  New
air/fuel filters, belts, etc.

Could it be DME relay?

Subject: New Ignition Key

	Well, I got my new ignition key from Porsche
yesterday.  Interestingly, it is not symmetrical, and
my supposedly bi-directional key only works one way.

	It does work, however, on all the locks it supposed
to.  Sometimes it takes a little bit of jiggling to get it
to unlock the ignition switch, but once that's done, there
is no further trouble starting the car.

	So, to recap:  My car wouldn't always start, due
to the key not turning far enough to engage the starter,
although the ignition could be turned on.  I considered
replacing the mechanical portion of the ignition switch
($330 part), the electrical portion of the ignition switch
($40 part), and the key ($31.72 total).

	I tried the new key first, and it worked.  I was
a little concerned that the switch had worn enough that
a new key would no longer work, in which case I would have
had a locksmith try to make a new key using a blank from
one of the mail order houses.

I just repaired the speedo on my '85/1 944 and didn't have too much problem 
getting the retaining ring off.  I followed Dave Darling's instructions (which 
he used for his 914). After finally finding a place where I could get the

Dear 'philes,

Three issues, as follows:

1. The sewing on my 1983 944 steering wheel leather is worn through; the
cover is fine otherwise.  I bought a (stated) exact replacement, but haven't
removed steering wheel yet to do the work (winter project).  Please give me
collective wisdom on feasibility of my removing and replacing the steering
wheel w/o causing damage.  Tips?  

2. My stock 944 wheels [polished alloy rims, black anodized (I think)
centers] suit me fine (I prefer them to telephone dials w/ my color car), but
black surface is abraded down to silver.  Is there a way to restore these
otherwise nice wheels to even black?  I thought of paint, but it would be
hard to match.

3. I am deeply, sincerely fed up with the Ted-O-Rama or Ted-O-Mania of recent
weeks.  Ted does seem to be full of himself, but the crowd is just feeding
the flames.  Classic psychology theory says, don't reinforce behavior, and
it'll die out.  Why not just IGNORE him?  Too much bandwidth is taken up with
verbose flaming.  I love the list, but enough is enough....

As an aside, I use plenty of colorful language myself, but there sure is too
much "asshole," "bullshit," etc in this conversation.  Go back and read
Stan's instruction manual, folks.

As a second aside, I echo Mike's endoresment of NMA (National Motorists

support them for their work on traffic and speed laws etc.  We need them.

Point of information.  If you use the Loctite 574, you are also supposed
to use an activator which I believe is referred to as Loctite N.  Both
are available from PCNA, although I don't know in what quantities.

The 574/N combination is recommended for a few sealing applications in
944-series engines.  I think most independent mechanics would probably
use orange case sealant (Wurth, Loctite, etc.) for these sorts of things.

I didn't think that these would have any effect above idle range,
that's why I didn't mess with them. Do you think the
throttle stop screws or air bleed screws would have helped my problems
at 1500-2500 rpm (engine crapping out under load as clutch is engaged).

Can you think of any other tires that this might go with, even if 
cornering l/r were slightly off, and wear was slightly un-even?  Those 
225's are a little too wide for me, but I am probably interested in all

Hello Porschephiles,

This is an update to the "Ted vs. The World" autocross situation.

There are two autocrosses this weekend at the Oakland Coliseum.
Ted was supposed to be present at the event on Saturday and possibly
on Sunday.  In fact, Ted bet me $10 that he would have a lower time
than me.  I of course accepted the bet.

Today he tells me that he will not be present on Saturday because
he needs to take his girlfriend to some "festival".  He said he might
be able to make it on Sunday.

He did say that does want to race.  Even though his new torsion bars
and shocks are not installed.  Even though his car has not been aligned
since putting new tires and wheels on the front.

These "facts" sound like excuses to me.  This from a man that said his
car was faster, better, quicker than man only a few weeks ago.  Ted,
these little details didn't make a difference a couple of weeks ago.
Why bring them up now?  Your car, according to you, handles better
than mine, has a lower center of gravity than mine, weighs less than
mine, and has narrower tires than mine.  With all of these "advantages",
why not come autocross?  Why the excuses?

A lot of people on porschephiles are coming out on Saturday to see
you race.  Are going to disappoint them?  Can you at least assure
us that you will be there Sunday??  I really want the $10!!!

carefully remove, physically inspect, and check performance

      The Maestro prefers Ford Water Pump Sealer (Ford Part Number:
B5A-19554-A), for sealing the Engine Cases.  At least for sealing 356/912
Porsche Engine Cases. Go ahead- LAUGH! But  it's worked well for twenty years
except for physically deformed/damaged cases in which case, the Silk Thread
 Technique is a better choice. (Don't laugh about the Silk String Technique-
the Military-Industrial 356/912 Porsche Engines for the Luftwaffe F-104 APU's
 used the Silk String Sealing Technique, but not the "regular" industrials!
 Back then your military dollars bought you something extra.)).
    Oh, and the Dow 730 is good stuff for certain applications, and at
$5/tube  (at the right Loco Surplus place), serves its purpose well. It's
good on Weber conversions for 356/912's to fill the countersunk bolt hole  on
the Weber to Solex Adapto-plate.
    Just for funsies, I once took a  pretty nice Original Case and put it
together with NO sealer!  And no leaks. I wouldn't try this at home again,
but properly-torqued, nicely machined metal surfaces don't need any sealer!
Ask the Cylinder/Head junction on a 356 about that.
    Itty-bitty tip: Please use a THIN (emphasis on the THIN), coat of
whatever sealer you select, and don't leave dingleberries to block oil
passages or ball up and block crankshaft oil  holes to a connecting rod that
 starves the rod for oil that spins a rod bearing that ventilates BOTH case
halves., not just the usual one.
That Case has a prime place in the Maestro's Collection of Broken Parts.
having about an eighth of an inch of Red RTV visible on its Mating Surfaces.
That gap alone would have meant certain demise oil pressure wise, but the
 DNA in the ball of RTV logded in the oil hole of the crank fingered the

Subject:  Carbrella and radar absorptives.

Thank-You very much Howard Rubin;

  Ah, a good guess.  Carbon compound impregnated foam.
  Wonder who vends it (i've got an idea who)  maybe I'll see them
next week at the IEEE EMC symposium...can i have a *sample*, say
the size of a car hood?

  Ooh, Howie has given me enough clue that i think i know what's 
going on.. to wit:

  Apparently the foam is lossy enough to absorb the radar *at distance*
to make the target appear less intense and therfore less proximity.
  In other words: the reflected signal is weaker than the adjacent
target vehicles...no wonder the cops dunno who in that approaching
pack of vehicles is the 85mph offender.  In practice the bra would
fool the cop and receiver into thinking the target was further away
than it really is, so he/she would be scanning after you passed and
continue looking for the target.  -no show-   {aint it great!}

  I should've known it would be a foam absorber...the ferrite stuff
is expensive and heavy, and intended for bigger boys' toys.  And by
adding more foam to 'cover' the hood/bumper is in effect piling on
more absorption.  The screwy thing is that the flat surfaces of the
target are not that reflective...the edges of panels are.
  Things like hood, door, windshield, and bumper seams (edges) form
the greatest reflectors to microwave radar.  I'm not sure why.
  The frequency of the radar is such that the wavelength just bounces
off even the knifiest edges (what is the wavelength at 18Ghz? i'm 
rusty)  Fo/980,000,000 =(feet).  OH! slot radiators..

  Anyway, treating these edges with absorptives should reduce the
cross section and therefore the reflective index of the target.
  Putting that material into a bra is a stroke of genius!

  A few words about laser radar and passive countermeasures;
  Laser radar works in a similar mode: reflectance.
  Seems to me that to confuse the laser receiver; deprive it of the
  reflected signal.
  How?
  Black or grey paint in a no-gloss finish, and elimination of all
chrome or polished surfaces.  What would happen if you painted your
car with primer or perhaps covered your machine with diffraction 
grating?  (an interesting lab experiment)  A Porsche in *blackface*!
  Once again, the object is not to eliminate but to minimize the
reflected signal.  In effect raising the target's noise figure.
     < end discussion >

  I submit, the cops are using technology, perhaps not that high.
  More importantly, radar exploits our own ignorance to the 
  technology employed.  Even the Russians had an answer to 'star wars'
  -coat the missile with 'ablative' coatings (wax) that melts
  and dissipates the heat of the laser.  pretty lo-tech huh?

Great paints, but *BLOODY* expensive in the US it seems. For about $130 I 
can shop Glasurit for a medium sized car....!(Acrylic, cellulose......)

The 356 should have cellulose paint.

I had been trying to locate a part for my 944S. I called everywhere.
No one had it. I was told "dealer part only."  A fellow PCA member
referred me to Kempton. I called them up, described the part, he
interrupted me and said he had it.  I redescribed the part, he
said he had it. I said cool and ordered it.  A week later, a 3 ft
part arrived instead of a 1 ft part...wrong part. *sigh*

I called them back up..same guy answered the phone.  I told him I had
ordered a part and received the wrong part...he interrupted me and
asked for my name. I told him what I had ordered, he said that's what
they sent me. I said, no, not quite.  I started to describe the layout
of the 944S airbox and how it differed from the 944, he interrupted me
and told me he was familiar with the car.  I was then put on hold.
Keep in mind, I was trying to give him the part number I received from
Kevin Gross the whole time. He kept interrupting me and putting me on
hold while he went to look in the bins.

Finally, I said, I have the part number!!!  I gave it to him. He asked
did I get it off the part. I told him I got it from another 944S owner.
He acted like that info wasn't worth squat. I described the part again,
back on hold.  He came back, asked for the part number again, and
confirmed he had the part in his hand.  Ahhh! Finally! He said he would
send it along. When I asked about returning the other part (more
expensive), he said just keep it.  All in all, I got what I was looking
for at a decent price. However, if he wouldn't keep interrupting and
LISTEN, I would have been happier.

Know what you want before you call. He sounds REAL busy.

My only concern would be why a car with only 19K miles would have had all 
this done already. Do you have access to the service records, and were 
there symptoms that required this work to be done? 

As far as high mileage Porsches are concerned, I was in about the same boat 
as you 2.5 years ago when I was looking for a 944 Turbo.  I just *HAD* to 
have the Turbo, so I sacrificed mileage and bought an '87 with 79K miles 
on it.  It now has 120K with several autocross and track events under its 
belt.  

In addition to the normal tune-ups and oil changes, my maintenance 
costs have included 2 new timing belts (replacing the rollers and 
tensioners as well), new brakes (rotors and pads all the way around), 
and a variety of gaskets.  I've averaged about $1500-2000/year for major 
maintenance.  Still not bad, considering I paid only 11K for the car.

From my experience, as long as the car has been *WELL* maintained throughout 
its life, mileage should not be an issue.

Denny Kahler has been an active PCAer for years and runs a fine shop.  We
had some tune up work done and an alternator replaced by Kahler's and felt
both jobs were done well (Denny even gave us a deal on the alternator).  We
had him do a suspension setup and were less pleased -- mostly because they
had an accident and dinged our fender when adjusting the camber (fixed quite
nicely by a shop Denny sent us to, tho), and the setup was not as aggressive
as we had asked for.  Overall I would still recommend the shop.  Say Hi to
Marsha for me if you go there.

Three other recommendations:

Valhalla Porsche in Lafayette (brothers Mark and John) -- they are very
honest and have done check-outs and other work for me -- also willing to do
partial work (i.e. you change the oil and plugs & adjust the exhaust valves,
they do the intakes and the rest and set ign. timing etc.) Good prices too.

Honest Bills Porsche in San Ramon -- if he's still in business (was having
trouble for a while).  Bill (HB to most) is a veteran racer and knows *A
LOT* of tricks -- a bit cantankerous though...  Good with 911 and 356s...

Waayy up in Bethal Island: Kurt Pressler of Pressler Parts.  Kurt is mostly
known for his *TRICK* mufflers but is also a fine 356 and 911 mechanic --
does excellent suspension set-up as well.  I'd check with him on parts as
well (he gave me a killer deal on a Corbeau carbon/kevlar seat...).

What is 'batty on seat belts and cycle helmets'? Does this mean they try 
'forcing' you into the usage of these safety accessories? 

In that case think of it like this; Cycle helmets are great, they assists in 
a cleaner environment as bikers thrown off car hoods doesn't leak as much as 
the ones without.

Same goes for the seat belts, more interior parts are being recycled from 
car wrecks due to the lower levels of human body juices in the fabrics.

There shouldn't be much to worry about 'upgrading' to a 2.2 liter I guess? I

Well after four months of searching for a 1970-1973 911S Targa, I finally
found one. Strangely enough I think that Steve Watson's 911 S Targa and my
911 were separated at birth.  Mine is the same year and model, the price was
exactly the same, and the engine was overhauled 4 years ago. Unfortunately, I
can't  tell how  many miles ago that was, because like Steve's (I think he
asked about a stuck odometer) my odometer doesn't work.  The paint on the car
is very clean, which is somewhat unfortunate because it's a faded yellow or
beige ( not my favorite color). The interior is brown, which also isn't my
favorite color but I know that I will learn to love it.  I just can't wait to
pick up the car today and drive it all over town.  
 However, there are a few problems with the car:

1.  The first gear synchro is completely worn so that you have to baby it
into first. I plan on getting that fixed soon.

2. The dashboard and the targa top material need to be replaced as well as
the targa top seals. Plusa couple of other parts that I mentioned in an
earlier post.

Other than that the car is in excellent condition. I hope to spend a little
less than $3000 to get it in top shape. So my 911S will end up costing me
around 12K.  Now try to name one other car that you rather have at that price
and that isn't a Porsche!

Sounds like what you have is a bad fuse box.  Usually around $100 installed.
Of course, it could just be a broken wire...
  
The starting point is with a set of wiring diagrams for your car.  Find out
where the 12 volts is supposed to go from your ignition switch and figure
out which one is not getting there...

The good news is: it's easier to fix a solid problem than an intermittent
one.

Overall, the fun that has been poked at Ted, in public anyway, has been
good natured. Pete A. did go a tad past center in his remarks to Ted, but
not without some justification.

Anyway, the crowd of people that are involved with this "Ted-O-Rama"

Subject: Brake cooling

Hi,

On my 89-951 with the 968 style brake cooling deflectors, I still
have some brake fade at the track.  Last weekend my rotors got 
a large number of small cracks in the face.  I guess this is common
experience with hard braking, but will eventually lead to a completely
cracked rotor.  Two cars cracked rotors last weekend. 

I would like to make a 'cool brake' kit as shown in pictures.
I plan to duct air from the front of the fenderwell off of the existing
ducting from the grille via a flexible hose up to the brake.  

My question is: should the outlet of this assembly cool A) the rear
face of the rotor, B) the inner part of the rotor where the rotor
is vented, C) both, or D) something else?

Also I was thinking of getting some temperature sensitive "crayons"
which can be used to measure the surface temperature of things like
brake rotors and calipers.  What would be a typical temperature
range for these components, and at what temperature would you 
start to worry about warping rotors or other problems.  I am running
Castrol LMA by the way.

PS my car is a lateish 1989 - #151269 and came from the factory 
without the ducting from the nose to the fenderwell.(!)  I was able
to install the factory parts (not real cheap though).

There aren't that many parts, but they need attention. On the front,
the top strut bearing, the ball joint, the tie rod ends (inner and outer),
the A-arm bushings, and the wheel bearings. Plus the torsion bars, the sway
bar, the sway bar bushings (and drop link bushings on through-the-body bars),
and stut inserts. On the rear, the bushings for the banana arm and the spring 
plate, the torsion bars, the sway bar and bushings, the drop link bushings,
the wheel bearings, the shocks, and the upper shock mount bearing.

The CVs are not part of the suspension proper, but need to be taken apart
cleaned and inspected, then re-packed with CV joint lube. Or replaced,
as necessary.

If you're building a race car, I'd just replace all the listed stuff with
new parts. If you're putting an old-timer back on the street, then check
all of the parts carefully and replace the bad ones.

The OE wires come with jackets to mechanically protect them.  I would assume 
they're there for a reason, and wouldn't be too thrilled at their absence. 
 The jackets also put a little extra distance between the wires, which may 
be useful for cross-wire interference purposes.

BTW, did you meter the old wires and find them wanting?

I have a mount that I purchased from a friend that distributes
autopower bars/cages.  The mount itself utilizes what appears
to be a rubber bushing that buffers some of the vibration 

between the car and the camera.  I was able to capture some
pretty good shots running on the track at Las Vegas with 

this setup.  Autopower has been the only source of camera

Has anybody else had similar experiences and if so, how were they corrected?

What exactly does this mean?  Is the Glasurit a two part paint, or a two part
clear coat?  If it  is clearcoat, can it be applied over my restored (cleaned,
rubbed, polished) old paint to offer better protection, and reduced oxidation?

Hi Paul,

Two (well, maybe actually three) excellent choices suggest themselves here:

1.  BFG Comp T/A.  These will be the least costly of the three, give the longest
tread life, and are *great* wet AND dry.

2.  Pirelli P700Z.  IMHO, these have the best subjective feel, maybe better dry
preformance than BFGs, (I dunno), and I dunno about wet vs BFG either.  FWIW,
for daily driver I'd go BFGs as all around best, for more limited use, I'd go 
for the P700Zs for their (to me, any way) superior feel.

3.  Pirelli P600.  OK, good but, IMHO, inferior to either of the above.

Incomminggggg...

Jim,
     
The paint that Porsche uses is Glasurit. I'm not sure about cost, 
but Stoddard's used to carry it so you might start there.
     
As for "collectability", I also used to be concerned with this 
subject, that is until my wife started making comments about my 
"garage furniture". I drove my '73 911T sparingly, as I had the 
body restored and it looked great. Now, after some self-inspection 
(philosophical, not physical) I drive my P-ship daily, headlights 
flopping in the breeze (yes, I go braless), a patina of rock chips 
gracing its leading edges. The point? Porsches were meant to be 
driven, not collected, unless of course you have wheelbarrows full 
of money, in which case I would collect Porsches to drive. End of 
speech.
     
On a more mundane tack, my rear view mirror was set back in too 
high when I had my windshield replaced. Could anybody please tell me 
the best way to remove it so I can lower the mount. Thanks

I'm no expert, and my (free) comments are worth every cent.  Now, no one should

I had a similar experience in my 911 when I took it over to the UK.  Died
on the M4 outside of London (about 58 miles out).  After sitting it started,
but died again in a couple of minutes.  Turned out to be a bad alternator.
The car just won't run on the battery alone very long, and the re-start was
just a good battery (recovering slightly with no load).

It cranked ok for a bit but just didn't have enough power to start.  Eventually
it wouldn't even crank, but started immediately when jumped.  Only ran for a
couple of minutes after removing the cables.

You may have a completely different problem though.

Hi Ted -

Your in luck.  The run group for your car is red which works first and
runs second on Saturday (Sunday you run third and work fourth).  You
should be out of there by 12 - 12:30pm.  By the way, did you ask GGR for a
refund?  I know they need the money but that doesn't seem fair for someone
that couldn't pass tech.  Maybe they will let Saturday be a free day
(Sunday's event is Diablo Region). You will have to ask or talk to Kasey

     Glasurit is a 2-part and 1 or 2-step paint; as a single step (color only)
  you mix hardener with the color. As a 2-step paint you don't add hardener
  to the color basecoat,  but you immediately follow with catalyzed (2 part)
  clear  over it. Single step Glasso is a different line, I think they call
  it 54 line or something. Practically everyone uses the 2-step
  basecoat/clearcoat. There is also a high solids clear available, I haven't  
  used it yet but it supposedly has twice the build (so half the time in 
  dust).
    As long as your paint hasn't cracked (factory paint usually doesn't) you
  can apply another topcoat only. Buffing and polishing wears the original
  clear off, and with it the deep gloss. The advantage of only putting clear
  over your old surface is only that you keep the whole film depth down
  (thick paint is trouble and will wear poorly), plus it makes sense to keep
  factory paint/primer/surface if it is still good (no paint job is better). 
  Adding clearcoat isn't something to treat casually, you still must do all
  the surface preparation you would do if you were going to paint from the    
  ground up.

    The 2 quarts is what I'd buy (Or I guess 1 quart of the high-solids 
  clear). I'd count on putting on 6  coats of clear and expect that you'll 
  eventually buff off 2. Before you decide to add paint, it is smart to try
  and buff your existing paint to see if you can't be happy with what you 
  have. I'm not great at this, but I use 2000 grit sandpaper, keep it really
  wet and really clean, before using rubbing then polishing compound.
    The glasso is really good stuff, my first use was on my sister's Toyota
  which parked at a refinery. Apparently managed by Homer Simpson, they
  had occasional overflows of some type that trashed the acrylic enamel. After
  trying to keep up with more repaints, I tried glasurit; The Glasurit seemed
  immune to the Texas City air and kept a great gloss for years until the car
  got sold. It buffs like lacquer and is fairly priced.

    Remember its only clear ! If you paint has bleached out clear won't help. 
   But it can be used to restore a dull finish.

Subject: Loyalty to Blaupunkt brand name


Hi everyone,

I was wondering if Porsche owners are by definition
loyal to the Blaupunkt brand name in their purchasing
pattern. For example, would they have a natural propensity
to buy Blaupunkt car radio/amp./speakers/cellular products.
I've noticed in the recent porschephiles debates that the Blaupunkt
car radios are preferred even though they are not necessarily
considered particularly reliable. However, speaker preferences 
tend to go more around Boston Acoustics, MB quart, Infinity or 
Nackamichi... So are we brand loyal or not?

As for me, I recently purchased the Blaupunkt Lexington CM84.
I am extremely happy with it. The ergonomics is amazing.
The sound is great even with my crumy factory speakers. 
I am not sure however if I'll replace 
the speakers with Blaupunkt 4'x6'. I have not heard them and 
I don't know if I can trust Blaupunkt on offering good sounding
speakers. I might get the Pioneer TS-4605 4'x6'. It sounds
surprisingly good for a 4'x6'. 

Any opinions are appreciated.
Andre Rotchel,
944, '86.

Subject: 951S Standard/Optional Equipment Questions


Hello Fellow Porschephiles;

My thanks go out to the many people who responded to my earlier post about 951 
questions.  About twenty of you responded and told me where to find the trip 
odometer reset switch.  Is this a great list or what?

Responses also indicated that I should bite the bullet and replace the belts 
now at 38K rather than wait and worry about it.  Well, I went to visit the 
dealer last night and asked for a copy of the Repair Order showing that the 30K 
mile maintenance had been performed as we agreed.  Lo and behold, item two on 
the R.O. was Replace Cam/Balance Belts.  It seems they had to replace the belts 
and did not even tell me!  The Porsche Used Car Warranty requires the dealers 
to replace the belts if there is no maintenance history available.  I will have 
to confirm this. 

The responses were pretty well split about brake squeal.  The consensus seems 
to be that some brake pads do and some don't and sometimes grit will cause 
temporary squeal problems.  I am going to the Autocross at Camden Yards this 
weekend and I will try to take a few % of brake pad off and see if the things 
change.

Regarding my shudder problem at low RPM, net wisdom says that the Turbos do not 
have much torque below 1500 RPM.  I may have mislead some people by mentioning 
the recent clutch replacement as a possible cause of the shudder.  Actually, it 
feels more like the motor lugging down below 1000 RPM.  A little more gas and 
all is fine.  Let the boost build and hold on!

Only one more question for now.  Does anbody have a list of Standard and 
Optional equipment for the 1989 944 Turbo model.  I have the option codes for 
my car, but one of the options listed was the Limited Slip Differential.  I 
think this was actually a Standard feature for the 89 Turbo models.  I would 
appreciate any information that could be passed on as I try to learn more about 
my car.  Please reply directly to me to save bandwidth.  Thanks in advance.

Funny that you mention the color. It is a bright yellow grease. But I

If this posting has alreay appeared, I'm sorry. I didn't see it or any

Recently, somebody pointed out the "Blow Me" sticker on the cover of the
911 Performance Handbook and asked if anyone had noticed it. Well, has
anyone noticed anything slightly amiss on the cover of the "Porsche 356
Gold Portfolio" book by Brooklands? The cover car is a "Speedster" or is it?
If you have this book, consider the following:
	-VW Beetle 4 bolt rims and hubcaps with P-crests
	-wrong mirrors and wiper arms
	-Speedster script too low
	-raised "metal" boss on which turn signals are mounted- they
	 should be flush
	-distance between headlight and turn signal too far
	-contour of fender above headlight doesn't look right (compare to
	 picture of real Speedster
IMHO, the publishers or editors have been duped by a kit-car as their
cover car for this book!!!
Don't take this criticism as a bad review for the book- it really is a
fine collection of reprints of period magazine articles about 356's. Well
worth the money (about $20).

Subject: 911 G50 Transmission Noise

Hi,

I am a new subscriber, and am enthused to get access to so many
fellow Porsche owners.

I have a 1988 911 Carrera with 41K mi. on it. Since first
driving it (I bought it with 27K mi. on it), I have
noticed that upon engaging the clutch in first gear between
~850-1200 RPM, an annoying grinding noise is heard until
revs reach ~1500 or better. This noise is also quite audible
when accelerating in 2nd gear from a "rolling stop", whether I
have disengaged the clutch (in anticipation of having to
come to a complete stop) and am re-engaging it, or not.

If engaging the clutch with more (>1250) RPM, no problem. I have
raised this issue to my mechanic (Don Wise at C-Tech, aka
Carrera Tech in Campbell) twice, and have been assured that
there is absolutely nothing wrong with the clutch or the
transmission. Another mechanic at the same shop mentioned
that "all the G50 transmissions do that".

I'd like to hear from others who have had any similar
experience, and especially if anyone has ideas about how to
silence this annoying sound. I have changed the transmission
oil to a super high quality synthetic with no effect.

Thanks,

     Hi Trond,
     
     actually, the 912 does need some non trivial welding to make it hold a 
     911 engine.  You'll need to find the rear cross member (the rear most 
     inner-body section connecting the back of the back of the rear right 
     quarter panel to the back of the rear left quarter panel).  Its hard 
     to make myself clear... Another way to put it is that the 912 does'nt 
     have the two rear-most engine mount gussets that the read-most engine 
     mounts bolt to.  These gussets are found on the cross member I'm 
     talking about (just open the decklid on a 911 and look at the two 
     motor mount bolts closest to you).  Maybe its possible to just weld in 
     the gussets?  I don't know.  I have a friend who is doing this exact 
     project.  He's building a '73 RS replica from a 912.  On his car, the 
     rear cross member from a 911 has already been spliced and welded in.

     I don't believe the tranny mounts any differently on the 912.

I'd like to know what engine to put in early 911's. As I've mentioned I'm

There shouldn't be much to worry about 'upgrading' to a 2.2 liter I guess? I 
also wonder whether the 912 needs lot of modifications to host a  911 
engine/box/susp.
     
I also have made a new 356 purchase, a mettalic blue '64 SC. It is in need 
of total 'rustoration' but I couldn't resist it. I haven't really got it

There is a much easier way to tell, though.  The interior was upgraded
as part of the 85.5 change.  Look at the dash.  Is it oval in shape,
similar to a 911, or is it more boxy.  The former is the upgraded dash.
Also, the 85.5 cars have aluminum trailing arms on all 4 corners instead
of the earlier pressed steel ones.

| Said vehicle is claimed to have 19K miles, what should I be looking for

| car has 80K instead of 20K, but what sort of things should I look at to
| determine the difference between 19K and say 30-40K?

Pre-85.5 cars only had 5 digits on the odometer, so it is somewhat problematic
determining if it has 19K miles or 119K miles.  I believe 85.5 cars had
6 digit odometers.  It is not too likely that the speedometer would have
been disconnected for thousands of miles, but you never know...

| Assuming it is accurate, would $8K be a reasonable amount for it?  The

$8K seems somewhat high.  Mileage is not everything.  A nine year old car
with only 19K miles has probably either sat for extended periods, or has
only been driven for very short jaunts.  Condensation in the exhaust system
can be a serious problem for a car that has not been driven much.  You could
be facing expensive failures in this area.  Also, the rubber parts of a car age
regardless of mileage.  The service mentioned above would normally not be
needed until 30K miles, so that is somewhat suspicious.

Have it professionally inspected and ask for all service records before
making a decision.

How about the fact that it needs to reflect back in the general direction of
the radar gun to be detected?  The flat panels are just as reflective as the
edges, they just direct most of the reflected energy in a direction that is 
difficult for the receiver to capture.  The edges are a great diffractor 
(scatterer) which also contribute to the slot radiator effect you mentioned,
by radiating a portion of the energy directly back at the receiver.

In the 5 years that I've been buying Porsche parts I've found that
"catalogue" outfits aren't necessarily the best places to find new or used
parts, they're just the easiest. One place I've found is called Performance
Wholesale (A.K.A. The Racers Group) in California. I've only dealt with them
once (so far) but they far and away beat everyone else's price on the H5
headlight lense that I needed. No one else would even sell me just the lense,
only the whole unit for $250-$285. I got the lense for $125. They shipped
promptly, were very knowledgable, and friendly. I will do business with them
again when I buy my new shocks ( I'm not telling what kind). You can get
their phone # and address from their ads in Excellence and Pano.

Tracey, 

Greetings fellow porschephile!  The autox sounded like a great initiation 
for your new pcar.  Based on my experiences, here's some answers to 
questions from your last two postings: 

> K&N filter
Aside from the melting gasket and my subsequent sending it back to the 
factory, I like the K&N for how it makes the car sound, and I notice a 
little bit of performance boost.  I'd wait until K&N fixes the gasket 
problem to buy one, as the current stock in most mail order places is 
probably from the same batch as mine.  Call K&N to make sure.

> Clutch shuddering
Mine does the same, especially when driven for a while in hot, stop and go
traffic.  My clutch has 100k+ miles on it, and I've been slipping the hell 
out of first gear to get fast starts during AutoX events for the past 40K 
miles. This may just be a 'feature' not a problem...

> Cam/Timing belt
I thought 30K was the interval recommended to REPLACE, not tighten it. 
Tightening should be done at 2K and again at 15K, according to the 
dealership.  Especially if you plan to use it in autocross or track events, 
I would replace it if they didn't do so before you bought it.

Hope to see you (and other local p-filers) at the Camden Yards AutoX this
weekend!

There is a *plug* which has a 4mm allen head, accessible through a hole
in the trailing arm, which often freezes up/strips out, for obvious reasons.
However, it sounds from your message that you think this is the adjustment
screw.  It isn't, that is behind the plug.  The adjustment screw also has
a 4mm allen head, and it isn't really a screw, it has splines, and if you
leave the plug out, it will just fall out on the road sometime (I found ...
no, a friend, yeah that's it, a friend had that happen to him once :) ).

Unfortunately neither the plug nor the adjuster is available from anywhere
I know of.  But some places carry a new design of plug which has a large
hex head so you won't strip it (Performance, Tweeks, etc, for a few bucks
each).  If you lose an adjuster, you can pretend you have a british car
and just use the one adjuster for both sides, and remember which side you
left it in.  You only play with it when changing pads, and you'll be changing
both sides.

Finally, if your adjuster doesn't do anything, check the archives, because
somebody posted a procedure which does get them working again.

When I bought the 911, I replaced the factory Blaupunkt (perfect working order,
and I kept it) with a dash removeable alpine deck, and put a 6 disc cd changer
in the boot.  That's got trade offs in convenience (unit in the boot I mean),
but it's not in the way inside the small interior.  Be sure to get a cd 
player with an oil damped suspension (made by KYB ?? <g>) or you will be
very unhappy, due to the stiffness of the suspension.  The alpine has been a 
great unit, and the only time it has ever skipped on me was when I literally 
launched the car off the ground on a "level" grade crossing...

I'm researching replacement speakers at the moment, and a separate amp.  The 
cabriolet needs a fair bit of stereo power to hear the full range of the 
music with the top down above 40 mpd, and beyond the legal limit, forget it...

 burglar. A reasonable person might have thought that Mr. Nguyen was referring
 to the camoflauge the cartoon cat burlgar wears, but someone else aparently
 connected Nguyen's deep-south name and shouted racism...it wasn't Ted or

Or, you can shop around on the 800 numbers and then call Zim's.  Their
price is usually lower than any other.  If not, when I have told them about
the lower price, they have bettered it.  I'm not sure that that is their
policy, but so far it has worked for me. YMMV.

Good place to start looking.  I'd also suspect the reference mark or

There are a bunch of other electrical things which could cause this

Er, I suffer from the same problem.  I just sort of assume it's there.
I am pretty sure it's the Wurth "Orange Flange Sealant," listed in their
catalog at p/n 893431 (which catalog I do have with me here at home).

They also have a green sealant for use in closer tolerances.  They claim
it's OE for Porsche, etc., but I am not sure in what application.

Not sure exactly what kind of buffer Stan has in mind.  We stay away from
the power tools because you really want to be careful not to take too
much material (ie, any) off.  My weapons of choice are fresh single-edge
razor blades, straight pick, and a small, flat-bladed screwdriver.  And
a couple of good CD's.

I agree with what Harry had to say.  I also like to avoid using too
much stuff because it's just that much more scraping next time you have
to take the engine apart.  This isn't much of an issue on a 100K mile
lifetime street car.  But it is an issue on a 40 hour (hopefully!)
race engine.

Subject: Re: 2liters  versus larger engines...


     Hi Trond,
     
     actually, the 912 does need some non trivial welding to make it hold a 
     911 engine.  You'll need to find the rear cross member (the rear most 
     inner-body section connecting the back of the back of the rear right 
     quarter panel to the back of the rear left quarter panel).  Its hard 
     to make myself clear... Another way to put it is that the 912 does'nt 
     have the two rear-most engine mount gussets that the read-most engine 
     mounts bolt to.  These gussets are found on the cross member I'm 
     talking about (just open the decklid on a 911 and look at the two 
     motor mount bolts closest to you).  Maybe its possible to just weld in 
     the gussets?  I don't know.  I have a friend who is doing this exact 
     project.  He's building a '73 RS replica from a 912.  On his car, the 
     rear cross member from a 911 has already been spliced and welded in.

     I don't believe the tranny mounts any differently on the 912.


     Derek

P.S. congratulations on the '64SC!  Is this the car with engine number #820 5?? 
you talked about?

By the way, I'm missing some more parts (Will my car ever be complete?).  Last 
night I discovered I'm missing a bellcrank from one of my european heater cans 
(I don't know right or left - they have different part no.'s) from the '64 SC.  
These are hard to find since most heater parts are USA spec over here.  Any 
chance you'd be able to help?

Hi,
     
I'd like to know what engine to put in early 911's. As I've mentioned I'm 
planning to purchase a '65 911 around christmas time. 
     
There shouldn't be much to worry about 'upgrading' to a 2.2 liter I guess? I 
also wonder whether the 912 needs lot of modifications to host a  911 
engine/box/susp.
     
I also have made a new 356 purchase, a mettalic blue '64 SC. It is in need 
of total 'rustoration' but I couldn't resist it. I haven't really got it 
yet, but the deal is struck and the 'handpfenning' is paid, so it is just a 
matter of time.........

Subject: 944 pre-sale ?'s SUMMARY


The following is my summary of the messages I recieved about various
pre-sale questions on a 944.  I'll send a message on what I
actually bought and some questions in a later post.

====

1)  How To Tell If It's An 85.5 Or Later

The most obvious difference is the dash, it's "oval" instead of a
"square box".

The suspension arms are also made of aluminum instead of pressed steel.

According to the spec book (Porsche part # WKD 423 320), VID ranges are:
WPO AAO 94 O FN4 70001-99999 for early '85 and
WPO AAO 94 O FN4 50001-69999 for post '85-1/2


2)  Various Bits of Information on Mileage

Tires have date codes embedded into the manufacturer numbers.  No 
suggestion was made on decoding them, but they're apparently there. :-)

To verify odometer readings, check the maintenance records.  If a car has 
regular maintenance, you should be able to tell how often it was driven.

An older car with extremely low mileage has it's own problems.  Shrunken 
seals, car isn't driven long enough to heat up and burn contaminents out 
of the oil, and condensation in the exhaust system can cause major ($$) 
problems.

Porsche owners in general take excellent care of their cars, so low miles 
are not as important as for other makes.


3) Other 944 Purchasing Advice

Avoid Metallic paints, they're extra expensive to repair.

Get a bra to avoid paint damage or be prepared for it to happen.

Pre-sale inspection is a 100% must.

Thanks very much to the ~20 people who replied to my message, it was 
quite enlightening and I hope the stuff above helps someone else out.

Hi Mike,

I can recommend the Cool-Brake kits for the 951. Simple, effective, and only
slightly more expensive than they should be.

In short, they work! They take air from a high pressure area (the air dam)
and send it into the inside of the vented rotor (where there is heat to be
carried off). Install them now!

Subject: re:Blaupunkt loyalty

 

IMHO Blaupunkts don't sound that good. Also, if you use an external amp
the only one that works correctly is a Blaupunkt. I tried to use a
different amp, I was told by the Blaupunkt repairman that while he would
sell me an interconnect he doubted if it would work right. He was right,
it doesn't work. I also compared the Blaupunkt two way speakers against
my Boston Acoustics (#757) the Bostons sounded much better. Infact if
someone is interested I've got a pair of Blaupunkt 2 way speakers and the
speakers for the rear deck of a 911. The Blaupunkts were suppose to have
a good FM tuner and the cassette section was pretty lousy. As with 
speakers, you should audition decks as well, because they all sound 
different.

Subject: 914 windshield sprayer



	In trying to get the stock 914 windshield sprayer system working,
the best I got was a water leak in the steering column, and sprayers that
were almost strong enough to hit the windshield. I checked the price of
the new parts I would need to get it working, and I thought the best thing
to do would be to join 1960's technology and install a universal electric
windshield water pump. A universal 12V pump cost me around can$20 (or
about 37 cents American) and the installation was as follows:

	Pump: mount it on the left side cowl support with an appropriately
sized hose clamp with the inlet/outlet on the bottom. This support is
found under the back edge of the front trunk opening just to the left of
the blower fan box.

	Hoses: there are two hoses that go through the front firewall to
the steering column. Find them, and cut them so they will reach the pump.
If you don't like cutting them, buy enough replacement hose to do the job.
If your car doesn't have a column mounted wiper control lever, you'll have
to find the hoses elsewhere (I don't know where). Make sure that the hose
coming from the reservoir is going to the inlet on the pump and the hose
to the sprayers is on the outlet. There are several connection/check
valves before the sprayers, I took them all out and used only a T fitting.

	Electrical: Column mounted wiper lever cars: There was a provision
in these cars for an intermittent-flick system that would cause the wipers
to make several passes every time the sprayer was used. According to
Haynes 914 manual, there was a relay mounted where I suggest to mount the
pump. The relay was actuated by pulling back on the lever which sent a 12V
current through a brown and black striped wire which you should find loose
under the fan blower box. It is shown on current track 6 of the 1974/75/76
wiring diagrams. If you connect this wire to the 12V+ connection on the
pump, when you hold the lever back, the pump will operate. The ground wire
of the pump can be mounted under the M6 bolt at the top of the cowl
support (above the pump). If you find a relay for the flick-wiper system,
you can take power off its 12V+ connection to supply the pump.
		Dash mounted wiper switch cars: You will have to wire a
push button switch with a 12V supply to the pump. I haven't looked at an
early car with this in mind, so I can't give any suggestions. Maybe you
could retrofit a newer steering column with the wiper lever.
	Operation: Before you try it, you should prime the hoses with
water by sucking it through them from the reservoir (use fresh water, the
windshield cleaner stuff probably isn't too good for your health) and
ensure the reservoir is topped up. Leave the lid on the reservoir slightly
loose so that the bottle will fill with air as water is used. You might
get a vacuum "hydro lock" if you don't. The system will function exactly
like the stock stock system- pull back on the lever and water will spray
(it might take a while for the system to get all the air out the first
time). The only difference is that this pump really WORKS! 

The beauty of this modification is that it works, its easy (it took me
about 45 minutes after I thought about how to do it), and it is completely
reversible if authenticity is a concern. Who says a 914 can't have a water
pump? It's just cheaper than a 944 water pump!!!

I hope I didn't miss anything, please tell me if I did and I'll try to
answer all questions.

Enjoy,
Eric

     This car is loads of fun to drive, especially on a warm summer day with
     the top stowed in the trunk, and has handling that's more than a match
     for lots of modern cars.  It's certainly not a 911, but it will not
     cost like a 911, either -- to buy, drive, insure, repair or maintain.

     Here is your chance to give a very pretty 914 2.0L a good home, and
     to finish that performance engine to your specs to make it a true
     rocket.

     Must sell due to other financial obligations (can you say "mortgage"?).

As an example I bought a well-maintained '76 911 2,7 targa (green)
with 100k miles on it 4 years ago. I paid 250,000 d.kr. 
(= $40,650) for it!

I've just bought me another 911 - also a '76 911 2,7 turbo-look (red)
in immaculate condition. For this I paid 210,000 d.kr. (= $34,146) - 
the only reason the price was this low (YES: LOW) is, that the guy was 
hungry for money here and now. The price should have been around 
270,000 d.kr. (= $43,900).

Now I just need to throw in a 3.2ltr, C2 brakes, 17" wheels, springs, 
shocks, etc. in my new car to make it like my old green frog :-)

(Sorry, Ted, but I've bought me some 11"x17" (rear) and 9"x17" front
 for my red turbo-look... :-)

Bottom line: STOP WHINING OVER PRICES!!!

>Date: Fri, 19 Aug 1994 16:13:25 +0200
>From Trond.Vidar.Olsen@hrp.no

>There shouldn't be much to worry about 'upgrading' to a 2.2 liter I guess?

I've been buying slowly buying parts to make the 2.0 to 2.2L conversion,
but the 69 911T 2.0L just keeps going...  

So far I have some 2.2L pistons and some used 2.2L heads.

Anyway, here's what I've read/heard.

   The pistons are 84MM rather than 80MM, and the stroke was unchanged.

   The 2.0L case does NOT have to be machined for the new cylinders.

   If you re-use the 2.0L heads, the head to cylinder surface has to be
   opened up wider to accommodate the new cylinder.

   The 2.0L cylinder to head gaskets will not work, the 2.2L version is
   needed.

   You could decide to get 2.2L heads since they will not need
   machining and the valves may be cheaper to replace.

   The rods of the 2.2/2.0L have the same big end/small end diameters
   and center to center dimensions.  The 2.2L version is re-inforced at the
   big end.  The 2.2L has a different rod bolt than the 2.0L version.

   The 2.2L rods will hit the 2.0L case, but someone told me the case can 
   be machined to clear.  I haven't verified that the machining can be done.
   Since no machine shop seems to advertise this operation, it is probably 
   an infrequent request.

   From what I've heard, many 2.0L owners upgraded to 2.2L using the
   2.0L rods.

   When you buy pistons, be careful, someone may (un?)intentionally
   try to sell 2.4L T pistons.  

   The 2.2L and 2.4L pistons have the same diameter and are difficult to
   differentiate.  The 2.2L T,E,S piston has a higher dome than the
   corresponding 2.4L T,E,S piston.

   For example, using a 2.4L T piston as a 2.2L T piston will work but 
   will only give ~7.0 compression ratio versus the stock 2.2L T CR of 8.6.
   = terrible performance and economy.

Subject: New 944S owner questions




Hi again folks, once again thanks for all the helpful advice (944 
pre-sale questions/wisdom).  I appear to have purchased a car.

1988 944S w/ 56K on it.  Not a ding, scratch or other mark on it.  
Sale price was 10K, the owner was very firm on his price and wouldn't 
budge an inch, this is probably do to the number of people who were 
willing to fly from deleware and wyoming.  Also, low blue book with the 
options he has is $10,900.  The pre-sale inspection went very well.  The 
ONLY (1! single! uno!) thing the mechanic found was a 1/4" crack on the 
right fog light's lens.

This begs the question:  Where's the cheapest place to buy a 944 fog 
light lens?  I would guess a used parts place would have some lying 
about, but I also suspect they are a popular item. :-)

Since this car is my daily driver, I'm looking at buying a bra for my 
new baby, is there a particular brand/type I should be looking for?  I 
have automotion's catalog, and they want $100 for one.  Suggestions?

Other things I'll be buying soon:  sheepskins, maybe a dash cover if I can 
find one that's not too cheezy looking, any shopping tips?

The paint/interior number is: LY7U/LY7U
The option codes are: C03 454 562 563 650 946

Could someone decode these guys for me?

Thanks bunch.

OK...I need some advice, there's a '62 356 for sale. The body is flawless, it
looks like the paint's been on the car for a while and there's no rust
bubbles anywhere. I haven't driven it yet as the seller ( a dealer ) lost the
keys but, there's no oil leaks and the motor is clean ( it hasn't been
detailed ). The interior is beautiful red leather in excellent condition and
( here's the kicker ) it's got 47,000 original miles ! They're asking $12,900
but said they're flexible on the price. Should I buy this car even though
we'll be tapped out for some time? Oh, and I need to know by monday when they
have the new keys and I can drive it.

                                                  Thanks,

As far as speaker applications go I'm extremely happy the MBQUART 218.02cx
mounted in the doors of my 930. It is a component set so you have to find 
a place for the tweeter (which was great for me since the previous owner 
had already cut a hole in the panel). But the 6 1/2" woofer will mount 
quite nicely  (without cutting) by using a spacer ring made by Quart as 
well. I mounted my amps in the trunk but there is plenty of room under 
the seats.

MBQuart also makes a coaxial version of this speaker which will eliminate 
the need for a tweeter hole, It's called the QM 160 KX.

BTW, I own a pair of car audio stores in Georgia. Feel free to e-mail with
questions.

The Adventure (Ted's) Continues...

Well folks, I have always been told there is no such thing as a
free lunch.  But, I have to tell that when it comes to betting
with Ted, there certainly is!!  The $10 I won from Ted today
bought Ken Shahoian and I a nice lunch at McDonalds.  Not a high
class free lunch, but free just the same.

Ted and I are in different classes (what can I say??) but are in
same run group (Red).  The Red run group ran second and worked
the course first.  This gave us a chance to see the problem areas
on the course.  Unfortunately, the first group consisted of "water
pumpers" and did not give a good indication of what a 911 might do
on this particular autox course.  On this day, you got one practice
lap and then a timed lap.

The Red run group ran an inverted grid today.  This means the first
person on grid runs last and the last person on grid runs first.
Ted was one of the last cars on grid (I was one of the first) so he
was one of the first cars on the course.  On his first run he did
a 50.460.  His second run was a 45.714 and he DNF'd his last run.
I did not see how many cones he knocked down on any of these runs.

My first run was horrible.  There was a 90 degree turn at the end of
a short straight that was my nemesis.  On my practice lap I applied
the breaks way late and took out several cones and lost considerable
time.  On the timed lap I applied the breaks sooner, but not soon
enough.  I took out 4 cones and ended up with an adjusted time of
43.344.  My second run went much better.  I got on the breaks at the
right time at my nemesis turn and had a clean run of 38.145.  I
experimented on the third run, thinking I would have four runs, and
totally messed up the slalom section of the course.  I ended up
with a 39.852.

Here are the times some of the more famous Zone 7 racers posted:

Dwight Mitchell (911)    38.073     37.342     37.539
Terry Zaccone (911)      39.366     38.286     37.952     38.923
Ken Shahoian (911)       41.960     DNF        38.063
Rob Niedel (914)         38.929     37.402     37.170
Lloyd DeMartini (914)    38.061     35.284     36.934
Hank Watts (911)         38.544     40.389     38.433
Dave Darling (914)       46.519     44.997     44.834

Top time of day went to Lloyd DeMartini in a 914/6 race car.  This
thing has a 3.2 liter engine, wide, very wide, racing slicks and
weighs very little.  I don't feel to bad being 2.861 seconds off top
time of day.

Anyway, I beat Ted by 7.569 seconds.  This means Ted was 20% slower
than I was.  This is more than the "few seconds" Ted mentioned in a
previous note to porschephiles.  I did have a problem with tire
clearance on my left front.  I needed to roll the fender lip so it
did not come in contact with the tire.  Once I did this, there was no
more problem.  I do not agree with Ted's assertion that I have too
much tire on the front of my car, even if I did have a slight problem
with the fender lip.  Based on the times, I will let you decide if
Ted is right or not.

Of course, Ted will find a way to explain away the results of today's
autocross.  But you, the viewers, now know the truth: Ted has no
clue as to what makes a fast car!!!

To be fair, I don't think anyone could have made Ted's car go fast.
It is poorly setup and that is why it is slow.  Today's autocross
did not give me an impression of Ted's driving skill.  Anyone would
look bad in his car.

Scott

P.S.  Ted, anytime you want to bet that you will be faster than me,
please let me know.  Free lunches are always welcome.

P.S.S. Dave Darling in his '73 914 2.0 beat Ted as well!!

Thom,

No, the 914 is NOT "really a Volkswagen". The 914 was joint venture
between Porsche and VW. In Europe it carried the VW-Porsche name
plate. Basically, the car was completey designed by Porsche and
used many VW parts. See chapter 21 in Karl Ludvigsen's book 
"Excellence was Expected".

It's the Wurth Green Flange Sealant, and is only used for applications where
you also have a gasket. Sort of like good old Permatex Number 3, but
for Porsches... I use the 574 stuff everywhere it's just metal to metal.

Oh, it's a light-duty piece of that 3M scrubber stuff impregnated with
some red abrasive compound (like jewler's rouge, but not quite). The
pads are 1" diameter, and have self-stick adhesive backs. They're just
the ticket for *AFTER* you've already used up your razor blade.... I
don't like screwdrivers or anything else that might damage the sealing 
surface. But these suckers are the *BEST* way I've found to really, really
get the surfaces clean. Chase with carb cleaner and compressed air, natch.

That's why you need to use the right stuff. All of the Locktite and Wurth
anerobic sealers just come right off where they're exposed to air, and the
very, very thin part where the edges actually seal and let the goop cure
really peels off very well -- particularly with that buffer pad gizmo.

And yes, Kevin, I do this for *10* hour racing engines, just like I do
for 100K+ mile street engines...

Subject: Re: Camera Mounts


A few of my own experiences....

THe I/O port mount workss OK, but shakes quite a bit,
esp on bumpy tracks. A real advantage of it is that you can
swivel it in any direction, making it easy to mount an a 
diagonal cross bar. But if you have a harness bar, you 
could also trek down to your local camera supply place
(bring your video camera) and buiy a clamp type mount.
This will be cheaper, and may be more stable if it mounts
closer to the bar. 

One of the problems that you face is that you want
the camera to be firmly mounted, so that it does not
shake relative to the car. But once you mounted the
camera this firmly, the recording heads shake, giving
you a bouncy picture. The best way to solve this is to 
separate the camera and the recorder. Mount the camera 
firmly to your bar, and put the recorder in some foam, 
or wrapped in your favorite sweatshirt and wedged between
the seats (be careful: it will come loose).

How do you separate the camera from the recorder? You have
several options. The cheapest is to go to a local
camera store and buy aon old camera/recorder combo for
about 150 bucks. Separates used to be quite the vogue until
the manufacturers realized people preferred it all in one. 
The downside here is that you get stone age VHS 
technology, sometimes with things like manual white
balance, poor batteries, and cables noone has seen
since Carter was in Office. The good news is that if 
it shakes itself to bits, who cares! Actually, the older
stuff seems pretty tought.

Another method is just get a second camcorder and use
one for the camera and run dubbing cables to another. 
Make the VCR one your best one -- eg hi8 if you have it.
Don't spend the money on those "stabilised" cameras,
like th TR100, since the vibrations inn the car are too
much to filter out anyway.

A third option is to get a Sony CCD G1 and a video 
walkman. The CCD G1 is a companion camera to the 
watchman and is really dinky and pretty cheap - about 
$300 I think.

Of course, you can even mix and match the three setups
I have described, those it may take some creative cableing.
You could even buy a super small commercial camera,
but these will be about $700 and don't have a mic.

Some final tips: set your shutter speed to 1/500 or
higher for better results. And turn off autofocus, as 
it tends to hunt around and focus on bugs on your 
windshield and such.

Is the 914 really a Volkswagen? I don't think so, not exactly, anyways.
The body was built by Karmann, who also built some 356B/C and 911 bodies,
nobody would dispute the name Porsche on these cars. It was styled by an
independent industrial design studio called Gugelot Design, which was
known for its kitchen appliance and sewing machine designs (I think they
probably should have stayed with what they knew!). The front suspension is
basically 911, the transmission internals are 901, in a box made by VW
for the 914 only. Various trim pieces were taken from other VW's or
supplied by Karmann. As for the engines, most of us know that both a VW
and a Porsche version was available.

As to it being a VW in Europe, that is only half correct. In America, it
was sold as a Porsche. Elsewhere it was marketed as a VW-Porsche by
VW-Porsche Vertriebsgesellschaft GmbH (VW-Porsche Sales Corporation) which
was a joint company established for the sale of both firms sports cars.
Therefore, the 914's in Europe sported both the familiar VW symbol and the
Porsche name. They even had the standard VW hubcaps! For more info,
"Excellence was Expected" by Karl Ludvigsen has a great history of the 914
(and all the other Porsches).

I don't know how other 914 owners feel about their cars, but I don't care
what it's called. It has reasonable acceleration (in 2L form), it has good
brakes, and it corners like very few other cars in the world. Best of all
it is affordable, especially with a 4 cylinder. My 75 914 is a daily
driver, and I don't think that there are many other cars available that
can offer the same level of performance at such a price. I can even go
scuba diving with a buddy and all our gear in it! Try that in a 356 or 911
(I know, a 944 would do it better, but...;-) )

I'm sure that Thom didn't mean what he said in a negative sense, but I
wanted to set the record straight and take the opportunity the share my
enthusiasm for the 914, whether it be a VW, a Porsche, or both (I have a
great deal of respect for both companies).

Enjoy whatever you're driving!

Subject: Mercedes, BMW, Porsche in F1 ???

Found this in rec.autos.sport and thought it might be interesting
reading to porschephiles...

Yesterday was an article about the Formula One in the FAZ (Frankfurter 
Allgemeine Zeitung). The title was 'Mercedes is missing a partner,
BMW and Porsche are missing a concept'. The german manufacturers 
have discovered the Formula One. Mercedes wants to enlarge its 
activities to a top team. BMW and Porsche have complete motors
but neither a resolution of the Managing Directors nor a real concept.
Mercedes will stay as supplier of motors. Helmut Werner said, that 
there will not a be comeback of the Silberpfeil. There is a crises 
in the relationship between Sauber and Mercedes, because of Sauber
being in a too bad position of the championship. The affair with
the sponsor 'Broker' is a problem too. Werner said, that there 
happend things that don't harmonize with the image of Mercedes-Benz.
Peter Sauber has to presentate a clear financal situation for the 
Season 1995 till 30th of September, a nearly unsolvable problem.
He needs sponsors for 40 million deutschmarks in 45 days.
Mercedes is negotiating with other teams. From Williams they got a
refusal, because of Renault making a better offer. Renault supplies
the motors without payment, pays money for the development and
50 % of the saleries for the drivers. The budget of Mercedes is 
a better poket-money compared to the budget of Renault. Ilmore 
gets only 25 million deutschmarks from Mercedes. The Managing 
Directors of Mercedes met with Ron Dennis one week before the 
Hungarian Grand Prix. McLaren has a contract for three with 
Peugoet. But because of a lot of engine defects it is rumoured
that McLaren is finishing the contract earlier. But this is 
doubted by most of the F1 team leaders, they think McLaren is 
only negotiating with Mercedes, that no other team has interest
for the motor. 
BMW isn't ready for the Formula One at the moment. But the F1 
has got some significance. The Managing Directors adjourned a
decision. The division for motor sport has to make a concept
till the end of the year. They are said to have a very promising 
motor with 10 cylinders. But the problem is to find a partner.
There are only four top teams in F1. Ferrari builds its own
motors. Willams has has a contract with Renault. McLaren is 
negotiating with Mercedes. Benetton refused a cooperation
with BMW as being pure speculation. Jordan would be most aspiring 
team, Ligier is advised by Briatore to new motor suppliers and
Bernie Ecclestone wants to maintain Lotus for being another 
traditional team like Ferrari.
Porsche developed a motor with 10 cylinders, that works since 
the 2nd of July. A group of 10 engineers built quietly a motor 
that should help to forget the fiasco with the V12 in 1991.
Although the motor is very compact and with less than 130 kg 
very light, it will not be easy to find a team for it.
With the development of the motor, the budget of Porsche is
exhausted. They need a financier to put it into action. 
Wendelin Wiedeking a Managing Director of Porsche said, 
that the announcement of the new motor brought Porsche a better 
resonance than all motor sport activities of the last three years.

Guten tag!

I recently had some cold idle problems solved by some adjustments
to my timing and CO mixture (I didn't do the adjusting - in fact I 
thought the problem was the warm-up regulator - shows what I know).
Anyway, now the car starts and idles great, but it now has somewhat
of a hesitation at about 3000rpm, where none existed before.  It also
seems that the familiar surge of power at about 4000rpm is gone.  I
have yet to discuss this with the guy that did the adjusting for me as
I have been out of town alot lately.  Anyone want to hazard a guess as
to what is going on?  Running too lean maybe?

Any ponderings would be appreciated.

All the recent discussion of sealants has been very helpful. I have a novice
question:

Could someone clarify when to use the Wurth Orange vs. Green Sealants?

The orange will fill bigger gaps, but given a clean surface with gasket, is
the green a better choice, or will orange work for all applications (i.e.
with and without gaskets)?

Thanks in advance for the info.

Wrong!!  They were sold in Europe and the rest of the world as VW-Porsche, by
a separate company, jointly owned by VW and Porsche. The rear emblem said
VW-Porsche.  The 914-4's were totally built by Karmann.  The 914-6 bodies
were built by Karmann, but the cars were completed by Porsche at
Zuffenhausen. Check out "Excellence Was Expected" if you don't believe me.
They were sold in the US as Porsche's for marketing reasons. Porsche designed
the 914.  Just look at front suspension; pure 911. 

Now let's talk about the rest of the "true" Porsches:

1. Very early 356's used VW engine blocks and much of the VW suspension.(Late
356's had unique Porsche engines).  And look at the cross reference lists
between 356's and VW's!
2. Many 911 and 356 bodies were built by Karmann.
3. All of the 924's and most of the 944s except the last couple of years were
built by Audi under contract to Porsche.
4. The 924 was designed to be a VW, by Porsche under contract to VW, but the
design was sold back to Porsche at the last minute when VW decided not to
build it.
5. The 1976 912E used a VW engine.
6. And Porsche is now building certain Mercedes models (so does that make it
a Porsche?)
7. The 924 used an Audi engine, also used by American Motors in the Gremlin.
So is the 924 an Audi?  Or the Gremlin a Porsche?

So what is a "True Porsche"??

Subject: Reply - "914 Wheels,,,,"

Ref: John@Pelican.HAC.COM - "914 Wheels, the true story"
John:
Just want to set the record straight--------
'70 thru '73 914's (4's) came with 51/2 inch steel wheels as part of the
appearance group, not 4 1/2.  I'll qualify this by saying that early '70 cars
came with a variable mix of appearance group items.  I know one local car
('69 manufacture) with appearance group, but without upgraded carpet or
foglights, and yes, 4 1/2 inch steels. It was "anything goes" with the early
production I guess.

Unfortunately, many folks take Brett johnson's 914 book as gospel.  Don't get
me wrong, it is a valuable reference source, but does have some errors - such
as:
1.) p 27 - lockpost fresh air vent filter was hogshair, not felt.
2.) p 57 - rear trunk pad (small version) was used thru 1972 models, not
1971.
3.) p 64 - the blower control shown as '73-'74 was also used in 1972.
4.) p 50 - wheels again - some very late '72 1.7 cars (July and August
production at least) came over here with Fuchs alloys as optional equipment.
 My '72 is July production and was fitted with them - couldn't afford the
$300 price tage, so had them put back to 5 1/2 steels.  Wish now I'd have put
out the bucks, but was already up to $4295 for a car with no radio or air
conditioning - try to explain that to your wife in 1972!

Still has the '72.  It's up to 71K miles and has been relogated to a mantle
piece since 1974, when we won our first PCA Parade concours class.  Many
others have gone under its belt, and it's better than ever, and ready to
compete with the other "best" 914's.

Cool.  Any applications in specific?  Do you use it, for example, on
valve covers or the thermostat gasket?  Or how-za-bout a 944 intake

and new gaskets, additional sealing is unnecessary.

No disagreement.  I use the screwdriver *only* on goop which has squeezed
past the sealing surface proper and collected on the surrounding casting.
The pick I use to clean the studs and around the base where they enter
a casting.  Sealing surfaces are the easy part, a quick scrape with the
blade.

I do follow with carb cleaner.  I don't like final drying with compressed
air because of moisture or other stuff which might be in the lines.  I
generally wipe dry with a clean shop towel.

Hmmm, I find the Wurth stuff, when outside the sealing surfaces, eventually
hardens pretty darn well.  Which is why the screwdriver and pick.

Take care.

Subject: Porsche OEM paint

To my knowledge, Porsche always has at least two paint suppliers. This may
be broken down by color, or to avoid problems in the event of a strike or
plant problems, but it's been two suppliers for as long as I can tell.
 
Glasurit is one, Lesonal-Sikkens is another. There may be others, they may
vary from year to year.
 
Spies Hecker is I believe only in the aftermarket. They're sold here, and
are also expensive.
 
Glassurit paints -- I am aware of two product lines, the 21 line is two
components plus thinner, the 54 line is I think metallic paint and is two
components, but I'm not sure on that.
 
I used Glasso 21 line when I repainted the dash on my blue 356, it works
beautifully especially when rubbed out with Glasso's #562-1602 rubbing
compound. Many of the Porsche colors, including the Sky Blue in this case,
are still in the program.
 
Sikkens and Glasso seem to compete for the affections of restorers. I have
seen great paint jobs in both.

Hi philes!

I am writing this in hope of getting some advice for a friend.
His 79 911 died on him a couple of days ago. It turns over but won't start.
I haven't had a chance to look at it but he's convinced that it's ignition
related.

This should be a C.I.S. car, right? If so should you be able to hear the 
fuel pump when the key is turned on ? I'd like to make sure it 's in the 
ignition before he starts to buy parts.He's interested in changing out 
his Bosch cdi box for an MSD unit. Has anyone done this ? What's the general
consensus about going to after market ignition ?

I'm reasonably sure I can track down his problem but if anyone has some 
suggestions I'd be glad to hear them.

Thanks,

Subject: 911 Generator/Regulator

Hi Folks,

About six months ago, my stereo began intermittently cutting out. The deck
would loose all power and stop playing. Whenever I pulled to stop to crawl
under the dash and see what was up, it would, without fail, miraculously
began playing again. Had these repeated episodes been shown on TV, I'm
sure it would have provided good entertainment.  

This weekend, I put a voltmeter to the power supply of the deck and
whenever It would cut out, the deck was receiving about 17 or eighteen
volts.  The battery is a couple years old and seems plenty strong. It
sounds like a regulator problem to me, although I'm not positive. I am
planning on replacing the regulator unless someone has other Ideas. Should
I replace the Generator at the same time (about 36,000 miles on 1985 car)?
The Regulator alone is about $125.00 and the regulator with generator is
about $310. Is there anything else which may have been damadged by the
occasional power surges that I should check?  

Any suggestions would be very much appreciated. Also, what is the
recommended method to clean up the cooling fan. As long as I'm in the
vicinity, thought I'd do a little housekeeping as well.  Thanks so much.

Just to set the record straight, I have a Zone 7 ticket for yesterday

the exit is too close to the end of the timer and not marked clearly.

Subject: Return/Observations/A/C Stuff


Well, I'm back.  After a total of 27 hours driving from Michigan to the 
mountains of Virginia and back (in a Dodge Caravan no less!) I am back to 
my 911 and the porschephiles list (which I'm glad to see is still in one 
piece - YIKES!  Sorry Stan.)

A brief observation.  While the weather on various parts of our excursion 
was far from Porsche friendly, I was surprised to count only (1) 993, (3) 
944's and (1) 911 during our trek.  this was Michigan, through Ohio, 
through West Va. to Va.  (By the way, Route 77 and, particularly, 64 in 
West Virginia would be great P-car territory (with a radar detector!) - 
Great roads for highways.  The mountain roads in the Blue Ridge of 
Virginia are the best though.  Next time .  .  .

Lastly, an update on my latest a/c inquiry.  When you turn your key to 
the "on" position (all the dash warning lights light up etc., but one 
stop before the crank position), is it "normal" to hear a "blower" like 
sound from the engine compartment (assuming a/c blower switch is 
disconnected)?  Does this mean the a/c compressor is running (even 
though the blower switch is disconnected)?  Or is it the "normal" 
operation of something else?  If there should NOT normally be this 
noise if the a/c is off (for example, if it IS the a/c compressor making 
lots of effort for no reason and sapping mpg's and performance at the 
same time), how do I stop it?  (Thak, I can't find the connection you 
mentioned near the battery).

All hep appreciated.  It's good to be back.  Oh, and fortunately I did 
not get signed off the list before the results of Ted's "Excellent 
Adventure" were posted. <g>

Ted,

I have never claimed to have all the 911 answers.  I do know a little
about 911SC bodies and wheel/tire combinations.

The problem with my front left tire had more to do with suspension travel
than with cornering hard. I could of driven around the autox course all
day except for the dip in pavement at the turn in point of the slalom
portion of the course. The fender was NOT mangled. There is no damage
that is externally visible. The inside of the fender lip is not stock
any longer, but who cares??

Ted, you wake up. I had one small problem that was fixed in a few minutes.
The same cannot be said for you car.

Ted, the highest bet you would take was $20 for a 5 second handicap. Lets
suppose I would let you use your DNF time for the bet. What is 45.714 -
38.145? I believe it is 5.839. How do you figure I would owe you big bucks?
In case you have not caught on yet Ted, 7.569 (or 5.839 for that matter)
seconds are an absolute eternity in an autox that takes 40 or seconds to 
complete. I didn't just kick your butt, I kicked it into the next galaxy!

First of all, I know what is installed on my car down to the last detail
with one exception. Until yesterday, I did not know who made the torsion
bars that are used on my car. The reason I had a problem with the tire
clearence on the left front is simple. The car was lowered another
half inch recently and I did not have a chance to verify the clearence.
I should have rolled the front fender lips a long time ago, The problem
is now gone.

Are you actually admitting that my car is setup better than yours? Are you
saying this is why I beat you? You mean, wider tires (along with the 
appropriate suspension mods) do make a difference? Remember, this all got
started when you claimed your car was faster than mine. Will you now admit
that my car is faster than yours and that you have a lot of work to do on
your car to get it competitive? Or are you going to suggest that I am a
much, much better driver than you? I would go with the former...

I have had experience with rebuilding 911SC alternators before.  The SC or

bolts) to change the voltage regulator.  I'm interested to know where you're

You should'nt need to buy a whole new alternator if it has only 30 something

Hi Folks,
     
About six months ago, my stereo began intermittently cutting out. The deck 
would loose all power and stop playing. Whenever I pulled to stop to crawl 
under the dash and see what was up, it would, without fail, miraculously 
began playing again. Had these repeated episodes been shown on TV, I'm 
sure it would have provided good entertainment.  
     
This weekend, I put a voltmeter to the power supply of the deck and 
whenever It would cut out, the deck was receiving about 17 or eighteen 
volts.  The battery is a couple years old and seems plenty strong. It 
sounds like a regulator problem to me, although I'm not positive. I am 
planning on replacing the regulator unless someone has other Ideas. Should 
I replace the Generator at the same time (about 36,000 miles on 1985 car)? 
The Regulator alone is about $125.00 and the regulator with generator is 
about $310. Is there anything else which may have been damadged by the 
occasional power surges that I should check?  
     
Any suggestions would be very much appreciated. Also, what is the 
recommended method to clean up the cooling fan. As long as I'm in the 
vicinity, thought I'd do a little housekeeping as well.  Thanks so much.

I agree, I was just pointing out my mistake of missing the the exit after 
the timing of my best lap caused a DNF.  If anyone else got a lower score 
than those you already posted, only to have it thrown out because they 
exited late after the timer, I would be interested in knowing, and would 
consider that their score was invalidated due to a technicality.

Close, it's 7.569.  You're right, you still would have beat me by 5 seconds.

I think your car was very likely better than mine yesterday.  I would 
like to do several things to my car before getting serious into autox, 
including some of what you have already done: torsion bars, sway bars, 
alignment, sticky rubber, etc.  No, I don't think your wider tires had 
anything to do with your lower scores, there were some pretty narrow 
tired 911's out there that I'm pretty sure beat your scores.

I completely agree with this, I'm not trying to change my score, You win, 
and Dave won (better score than mine), congratulations.  I'm just saying 
that I got around the course lower than the #'s you posted.  If you or 
Dave had better scores, but they were disqualifed because you exited 
wrongly or whatever, speak up!  

By the way, what were your scores, relative to others today?  Who were 
the top 5 or so, and in what kinds of cars?

You do know, that if I had kept up my trend yesterday, cutting 5 seconds 
off my first run, then 2 seconds off my 2nd run, I would have caught up 
with you by that 4th run that we were supposed to have... <g>

Is this a coupe or a cabriolet?  A T-5 or a T-6?  A Normal, Super or a Super 
90?  How can you be sure the 47,000 miles are original? 
 
Based on my experience, here's what I suggest . . . 
 
You may be passing up the deal of the century, but I'd say if you're asking 
this question you ought to pass on this one until you have acquired the 
knowledge you need to be a bit more comfortable with this type of decision. 
 
One other possibility would be for you to contact the local 356 Registry 
chapter and ask them to recommend someone in your area who is 356 
knowledgeable and is willing to assist you with the appraisal.  (The national 
membership chair is Barbara Skirmants at 810/575-9544.) 
 
By the way, one way to begin learning about the cars is Dean Batchelor's 
"Illustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide" ($14.95 from Motorbooks International at 
800/828-6600.)  Another resource you might consider is Brett Johnson's "356

OK...I need some advice, there's a '62 356 for sale. The body is flawless, it 
looks like the paint's been on the car for a while and there's no rust 
bubbles anywhere. I haven't driven it yet as the seller ( a dealer ) lost the 
keys but, there's no oil leaks and the motor is clean ( it hasn't been 
detailed ). The interior is beautiful red leather in excellent condition and 
( here's the kicker ) it's got 47,000 original miles ! They're asking $12,900 
but said they're flexible on the price. Should I buy this car even though 
we'll be tapped out for some time? Oh, and I need to know by monday when they 
have the new keys and I can drive it.

This has got to be an effect of taxes/tariffs. Or do they just
not have police in Denmark, and figure speeding tickets into the
price of the car :-)

When I was in Stockholm, a 2Liter Coke costs US $3 equiv (21 Kr). 
They had 20-25% tax figured into the price of everything, which 
still doesnt explain the price difference. The Coke was bottled in
Stockholm, not in the US. 

I thought the European Community was coming together to be

You should contact Paul Weston of Weston Motorsports (see

He has tried EVERYTHING including water injection and may  have some
tips.  He can also hook you up with Cool Carbons at PCA discount.

I was able to run REPCOS and no cool brake on mine with turboS
suspension, but I ran the GTP Fans.  The fans make a big difference if
no cool brake is installed and some if it is.

The setup you were desctribing sounds like te Holbert (now OGRacing)
kit.  Having attempted to fabricate myself, I can say the kit is worth
it.

My philosophy was maximize cooling and run inexpensive pads.  Seemed to
work pretty well.  I did not have warpage or cracking, and I was not

I am not a complete idiot, the light is on and stays on.  
I started the car this morning and it is still on. From what
I understand from the manual, and how ABS systems work in every other car
that I have ever known, the ABS light indicates a failure in the
ABS system.  It is considered a level B failure on the 928.  
With the light engaged, the breaking system functions without ABS.

This past Saturday night was our regions annual "beat the heat" night autox.

While working the course we spotted two different 944's that had spastic 
passengers front blinker light that would flash ~10 times per second as 
they were letting off the throttle at high rpms.

Generic flaw or vibrating relay contacts?   Yea, they were showing their 
superior skill by flashing their signals...

Except for two confirmed air strikes by big skiters we had fun.  At least it

If 911's are selling for thoose extreme prices in countires such
as Japan, Denmark, Norway, etc. how come people in the US do not
ship their 911's over to thoose countires with a FOR-SALE sign
right on the shipping crate?  

For that kind of cash, I would wash/wax my 930-look-alike 1981 911SC,
box it up, and ship it out.  The extreme profit alone would cover
a new 911, shipping costs, and probably my law school tuition as well!

It seems like a very profitable thing to do (buy in US, ship to another
country).  There must be some export law's that prevent this type of thing?

Some of the SCs (my '80, for instance), have an external regulator by the
left firewall.  Replacing it is a snap.  One reason I've kept my original
alternator rather than replace it.  I believe the car in question was an
'85 though, so this probably is more of a trivia answer.

Intermittent flash of ABS on most 2nd gen ABS systems is a way of
letting the owner know he's getting what he's paying for. In particular,
that it's actually engaged and doing something. Because US drivers
are insecure and typically can't feel it go on.

Based on your new description, I'd bet that you engaged ABS, possibly
for the first time, during the rain storm, and that something failed.
The question is what, and for that you'll need to have the car checked
out by someone that has the right gear and parts.

Good luck.

Hi, Bob.
 
$600 for a genuine Nardi is a little on the low side, I've seen them going
for a bit more.
 
Brett Johnson's book, which has been known to contain mistakes and
omissions, says flat Nardis (no dish to the spokes) were "definitely factory
supplied on some [356 A] cars, especially 1959 Carrera GS and GT models...
Factory installed Nardis can be distinguished from aftermarket versions by
the fact that the latter had the last two digits of the year of manufacture
stamped on the back of the middle spoke; the 'original' Nardis did not."
 
If the wheel you saw was dished, it is an aftermarket Nardi.
 
Genuine Nardi wheels, whether OEM or aftermarket, have a Nardi signature
on the upper right spoke.
 
Johnson says that the German maker VDM made the wood-rimmed wheels for
1960-65 applications. This was used as an option in those years, and would
be the "correct" factory optional wood wheel for your car, according to the
book.
 
I'm reluctant to say "This is the way it was" because it's always possible
the factory bought a few Nardis to put on later cars, etc. There are no
guarantees, but lots of blanket generalisations in the old car resto
bidness.
 
See if the wheel you found has VDM or Nardi written on it anywhere. VDM
also made the bone-stock wheel you probably have in there now. Some people
are making repro VDM wood wheels by cracking the plastic off standard wheels
and attaching new wood rims. The real thing is supposed to have an ebony inlay
in the center of the wood facing the driver.

    A 4WD buddy of mine calls my 914s "go-karts".  And I always take it as
a compliment.  It corners like a small, special-built racing car running
on "racing" slick tires.  Of course, we all know that it corners *better*
than that...
    Just try waving at a 914 pilot from inside a 914.  When I'm out playing
on a sunny day, top down, grinnin' like a fool, I can usually find someone
else doin' the same.  I generally get a wave and a *big* grin.  We both know
that we're enjoying one of the most fun cars on the road.

I can't tell you about the 911 chip, but I can provide so info on another
of their chips for a normally aspirated car. A representative of Superchips
is on the (ahem) late-model Mustang mailing list and enticed a couple
members to provide their cars as "proof" of the capability of their chips.

Neither member could show an improvement at the strip or track, and one
of them used a dyno to show some power gain, but not enough to
get ouside of the error range of the dyno.

Superchips also recommended against using their chips in heavily
modified cars.

The above is a recap, based on memory, the _long_ story is available
upon request if you email me directly.

Hi:

Following much deliberation, I've decided I must part with my '62 356 Super

road-worthy condition and, unfortunately, I just don't have the time.  The 
notch back is essentially complete, numbers match, and it will make a great 
project car or (gasp) an outstanding source of 356 parts.  My questions to 
you are (1) what would be a fair asking price, and (2) is there anyone 
interested?  I'll provide some history and specifics about the car below.  
Any information or interest would be greatly appreciated.

356B Specifics:
'62 Early Super Karmann Hardtop
(T5 chassis but came with twin-grill deck lid.  It was one of the last T5's, 
as far as I can tell built in Sept. '61.)
Chassis:  201042, Motor:  P085665
Slate Grey, Red interior

Short History:
I purchased the car in '68 in Salt Lake City, as the third owner.  It had 
about 70,000 miles.  Engine rebuilt in '69 (Larry Moulton, Strong's Porsche, 
SLC), only changes were Mahle C cylinders/pistons and a 912 distributor, 
balance of engine was to original specs.  Body refurbished in '69-'70, 
looked great when I got it back to reinstall all exterior goodies except 
windows, but time exposed too-thick paint and hidden poor underbody repair.  
Car driven to State College, PA, in '71.  Front suspension rebuilt in '73, 
with new bushings, link pins, etc.  The poor body work, and 3 years in  
central PA, lead to rust and car storage in '74.  During '83-'85, I started 
work for restoration, including brake system and transmission linkage, and 
was researching shops for rust repair.  Transmission was outstanding with 
smooth sychros, and everything else worked including Blaupunkt am/fm radio.  
In '85, car was transported to Alabama (when I took employment here) and was 
garaged.  Car now has about 120,000 miles, with about 30,000 on the engine.  
The engine was last ran in '85, and not started since.  Battery was removed.

Goodies:
Koni shocks (installed '70) and steering damper ('73).
Matching VDO oil pressure gauge (mounted in dash were some have clock).
Bursch street exhaust ('84), installed but essentially unused.
Lietz chrome luggage rack (the original with car).
New tail lights, one and Euro lens not installed.
MG Mitten car cover.
Several miscellaneous new parts not yet installed, and some used parts.

Rust:
Needs new floor pan and longitudinals, battery compartment floor (not from 
acid damage), lock posts (door jams, but have Porsche replacements, bought 
in '71, not RPs), and at least one rocker panel.  Body has rust but should 
be very salvageable.

Missing items:
The only missing items that I know are the battery and its ground strap.

Subject: busted 6mm stud on 911 engine ?

Hi 911 owners,

Here's one for the useful tid-bits file in case you find yourself
needing this.  There are a bunch of 6mm x 22mm studs all over the 911
engine.  In particular there are about 20 that hold on the chain
covers and some that hold on the fan shroud.  If you snap off one
of these for some reason(not your own fault) and it becomes necessary
to drill out the old one (making sure of course that your metal shavings
don't go into the engine) you may have to re-tap oversize.  If so, you will
find that Porsche studs no longer fit.  VW commonly has this problem
on their oil strainer covers and have a part which replaces their
6mm studs with one that is 6mm on one end and 8mm on the other.  This
stud is 21mm long rather than the Porsche 22mm stud, but ought to
work ok.

I will let you know if it really does work later this week :-(
If it doesn't - anyone know where I can get a lathe cheap ?

Subject: 911 valve timing

Timed my valves yesterday on the 911.  At least I think I did!  Perhaps
I'm reading too much into the timing procedures in the books or in
the ranges specified.  I found that the resolution in the vernier
coupling (cam sprocket to cam coupling with the dowel) was actually about
the size of the range allowed (or slightly larger).  (From memory now)
the valve travel range at TDC overlap is 0.055" to 0.067".  In the first
position I tried, the valve travel was bang on 0.055" (or whatever
the lower limit is), but I wanted to be at the other end of the scale so
I advanced the cam until I was able to get the dowel into the very next
position.  This put the valve travel just past the top end of the limit
(0.069").  On the other cam the two positions I was able to get were 0.057"
and 0.071" the latter of which I chose since it was closest to 0.069"
on the other cam.

Before I moved the dowel to the second position I double checked every-
thing to make sure the hole I chose was really the nearest one to the
first hole.  Did I do something wrong, or is that really all the
resolution I have ?

You DON'T have to buy a whole new set.  Check the Yellow Pages for
a piston ring maker, or check a local parts house, like BAP/GEON, 
maybe NAPA.  You can have a single ring made to virtually
any dimension.  Costs about $5.00 each.  The parts houses
usually don't have single rings, but most can get a set of three
for a single piston.  Costs about $25.

By the way, I've gone the custom route to buy top rings for
the engine I'm rebuilding now.  It has 200K miles on it, and the
upper piston ring gap has worn slightly so that the standard Porsche ring
leaves a face gap of about 0.005".  Bruce Anderson (and the factory,
I think) recommends 0.004" max.  Rather then buy a complete set
of pistons ($$$), I bought six top rings that are a few thousandths
of an inch wider than the standard Porsche.  If I remember correctly,
the Porsche ring is 1.5mm = 0.0591", and the standard U.S. ring
thickness is 1/16" = 0.0625", or 0.003" wider.  That was enough to
bring the installed face gap to within 0.001" - 0.002".  The six
rings cost $28.  The psiton set costs $1000.

Feedback I've heard regarding 968:
 - Quick, handles great
 - Subjective styling
 - Clutches are a weak link if car is driven hard

Clutches do seem to be a problem for these cars but I'm not sure
why.  One of our PCA region members has a 968 and toasted a clutch
at a time trial we attended at Las Vegas.  If you're buying a used
one, I'd definitely make sure that the clutch is new, or under
warranty.

1.	During a wonderful weekend at Whistler, B.C. hosted by PCA Canada 
        West Region and Pacific Northwest Region I had the misfortune of 
        having the "TURBO" badge on the rear of my 951 stolen.  The paint 
        has been scratched, but I should be able to fix that.  My 
        question is, what's the best solvent to use to remove the Glue 
        left from the badge without damaging the paint? (I do have a 
        clearcoat).

2.	I've started to create a custom log book for my car.  I was 
        wondering what the ideal log book would contain in terms of 
        information and I'm looking for suggestions.

Kevin asked (re: micro fiche manuals)

  >1) are the manuals advertised proper Porsche manuals????
The one I ordered "1978/83 911 SC Workshop Manual - Micro Fiche" is from
Porche North America.  Unfortunately I erase the part number from my
palmtop, I'll get it for you tonight.

  >2) what formats can these be obtained in????
Paper, fiche (9 sheets).  There is also an exploded parts fiche, I'm told
without part numbers though - which doesn't make sense to me!  I held off
getting that - havn't decided based on contents of the manual wether it's
worth getting.  I asked about CD-ROM and got a blank stare.  Parts
stores/dealers apparantly think fiche is state of the art.

  >3) whats the cost??????
I paid $16.00 after PCA discount for the workshop manual.  The dealer
cost is 12.00.

I wonder if I can figure out a way to hook up my fiche reader and
my hp page scanner and make the book electronic !

Hi John,

Thanks for the reassurance that nothing hideous is wrong mechanically.

It is amazing to me that with arguably the most finicky and demanding
clientele in the automotive business, Porsche has not: (a) been
inundated with owner comnplaints about this, and  (b) in response,
issued an upgrade kit to fix it, or define other means of eliminating
it.

"All the G50 transmissions do that" sounds like something I would
hear from Mr. Goodwrench at the local Chevy dealer as he considers
the case closed.

I hate it when this happens......

951 in one of these countries??  Is the price difference 100% due to
govt. taxes??  Are there prohibitive export/imprt regualtions, armed
guards, or pirates that prohibit this??  Perspiring minds need to know.

Now I sell the 951 and get a 911.  Hell I'll just go into German metal

that happen in the 80's here with grey market cars?

Subject: Targa Top Redo

I didn't get an overwhelming response to my question about hinks 
and kinks for Targa Top redos.   Perhaps few tackle it for fear of the 
unknown.  My experience might help.

I completely tore down, cleaned, repainted and installed a new top 
and headliner this weekend.  It wasn't hard, and it came out fine.  It 
looks brand new, and fits on the car beautifully.  

I don't think there's any real trick to it.  Just go slowly and carefully 
and pay attention to how the old one was put together.  There's really 
only one aspect to reassembly that I would offer advice on, and it has 
to do with reattaching the "floating" plates by strips of webbing (I 
used seatbelt material, obtainable cheap from most fabric stores.) so 
as to get them spaced properly.  It's easy to do and easy to explain, 
but a pain to write out, especially if no one is interested.  If you really 
want my advice...let me know and I'll either write it out an e-mail 
version of draw a diagram and mail it to you.

If your top isn't in terrible shape, you probably won't have to redo the 
webbing.  Mine top was a disaster.  I'm sure it was the original 22 
yearold top, which the previous owner had covered liberally with 
gobs of silicon seal in a valiant effort to stem the leaks.  The headliner 
would more aptly have been called a head hanger, because it wasn't 
lining anything anymore.  Even the half roll of duct tape (applied by 
the previous owner, natch) wasn't enough to hold it all on.

Subject: 944s that stop in the night.......


I've seen a few messages about 944s that stop of die while driving. 
There are a few things on the checklist, especially if it's a pre 
1985 1/2 or a 924S (and all 924s).

The VW electrical portion of the ignition switch is notorious for having
power trace 15 (switched power) fail. This is the lead that feeds many
locations, ignition and computer, relays that control power only when
the ignition is on, etc. Oncew this fails, no current gets to those 
points but the starter will turn the engine, and sometimes provide 
enough current for the engine to run until the key is set back to the 
main `on' position. If you check this and it is okay, then have someone 
turn the key on and check for power at the fuel pump. If no power, check
the  fuel pump relay and it's fuse (if fused). If there is power, but no hum, check for a bad ground, if the groound is okay, then the fuel pump 
is history. If there is no signal or power when the key is turned on to 
actuate the relay, then either the DME is bad or power to the DME has 
been cut, maybe the DME relay.

There is also a power circuit in the 924 Turbos (and 944 Turbos) that
cuts off the fuel when over boost is sensed. These sensors can fail 
open, turning off the fuel pump. A friend of mine who should know better
adjusted the valves on his 924 Turbo, forgetting to reconnect the 
overboost sensor. He replace a lot of parts before I pointed to the 
unconnected wire. 

For an accurate definition of your fuse panel, relay location, fuse
capacity/location, consult the Poersche Technical Specification for
your car. All front-engined cars have a picture of the fuse panel, 
excepting 1990 and later 928s (these are the same as the 1986 and later
models). 

There are a couple of harness connectors at the firewall for the 924/944
line. These have Molex-type pin connectors and can corrode. A simple 
disconnection and cleaning with TV tuner cleaner (Radio Shack) and a few insertions will clean the contacts enough to function. An application
of Permatex dialectric tune-up grease will displace any future moisture
and retard futher corrosion. 

I periodically check all connectors that are exposed, such as the engine 
harness, cleaning and repairing as necessary.

BTW, the diagrams in Haynes are acurrate up to the 1987 944s. The fuse 
panel and contents are covered in the Tech Specs and a little in the 
owner's manual of you car.

It's a great video, because it has footage of me in it. :-)

I'm in my 914, in CS in 1991 at Salina.  They show me getting sideways in the
offset before the nasty off-camber right-hand 180 on the South course.  It's
okay, though -- they show Jeff Reitmeir making the same mistake in the same
place (although he was going a little faster than I was).  The footage for
that segment was shot from the roof of the Yokohama truck.

Seriously, though, it talks about what autocrossing is all about, and has
some interesting interviews with some of the faster folks.  It's not a great
video for experienced autocrossers.  And while a large percentage of the
footage shows Porsches, it's really not Porsche-centric at all.  There is
a 930 they show all the time with the inside front high in the air, though...

It's cool, but it won't teach you a whole lot.

Fellow p-filers:

I saw Ted M drive. It was painful, no matter how we yelled and cheered 
him on, it was slow. Yes Ted, you did go faster on your last run, but 
DNFing negates any positives for the run. Jack Palance said he crapped 
faster than Ted went. Maybe. At least Ted showed. That's the first 
hurdle.

To Ted:
Now, September 18 is the date to plan for. At the Oakland Coliseum 
Parking lot, register by 8:30 am, this will give you four, maybe five 
runs to  smooth out your style ( Golden Gate Region Event). 

Forget about all the gas you've earned from the net memebers, get out 
there  and learn how to use it. Worry about the times and how great you
are later. You need to do some bonding with your Porsche. I recall
Walt Maas spinning more than a few times when he Autocrossed for the 
first time. He just smiled and got better. A good example there.

You missed a challenging course on Sunday. There will be more. No 
excuses. Just do it.

I'm Australian, and I've looked into taking my 944 to Australia for
that reason. My '86 944 is probably worth somewhere around 7.5K,
while in Australia it's probably worth around $A35K. I found it was
probably not economical for the following reasons:

	- it would cost about $4K to ship it to Australia
	- you have to pay import duty, and this is a fairly hefty percentage
	  of the cost price. This percentage is reduced depending on how
	  long you have owned the car outside of Australia
	- but the biggest item is conversion to right hand drive. I tried
	  to get some quotes on this, and it varied from $A8K to $A15K !!
	  You can get a temporary licence for a LHD car (also cars older
	  than a certain age), but to licence it permanently it must be
	  converted to RHD.

On top of that, prices of used cars are much more flexible in Aust, and
apparently converted cars are worth considerably less than original
built-for-Aust cars.

Japan also drives on the left, so conversion costs would probably be
involved there as well. Most of Europe drives on the right doesn't it?
so conversion wouldn't be a factor there.

The bottom line is that most countries where prices are high have various
import duties and things to prevent this being very worthwhile. And usually
it's only citizens of the countries in question who get any kind of breaks
at all. For an American to bring a car to Aust to sell, he would have to
get a "compliance plate" which proves the car it built to Aust standards.
Basically this would mean that it was built for the Aust market, and they
have to be bought with the plate from the manufacturer.

Despite all this people do bring cars in to Aust, and if you know what
you are doing and what to bring, it can be worthwhile.

Which brings up another point - I wonder if I could get it converted to
RHD here cheaper? Anyone hear of places in the US which do conversions?

Right you are John.  Simply put, there is a law against registering right

Subject: Perfect Porsche Trailer

Well, Stan's suggestions are good, depending on how many $ you have.  Just
plain uncovered trailers have some advantages, including being cheaper,
lighter, thus easier to tow and maybe not requiring such a heavy rig to
tow with.  They also may offer better visibility while towing and are
sometimes easier to store.  Of course you can't store all your "stuff" in
them like you could a closed trailer. 

For closed trailers I'd look at Wells Cargo first, just because they are a
national brand and have a dealer just off I5 in Fife.  They have a series
they call autoWagon which includes a rear ramp door, beavertail and a
whole lot of options for someone hauling a car.  The trouble is last time 
I looked they only came in a 6 foot 6 inch height, which doesn't 
meet your wish of a lower trailer.  (If you're approaching 6 feet in 
height, though, you'd probably appreciate the higher unit when you're 
inside it.  Not having that problem :-) I feel comfortable in the lower one).

Several vintage racers I've talked to like C and C saying it has better
quality.  They're in Hazleton, PA, 717 454 0819. 

There's also TPD in Sacramento, 916 381 0532 who make both aluminum and 
composite trailers and Featherlite in MN, 800 800 1230, but again both 
make only 6 foot 6 inch high units.  Also, many others.  

I saw a nice trailer made by an outfit in Eugene, OR which builds them to 
your specs, and they are only 6 feet high.  The name is Trail-a-long, 503 
343 5363.  It seemed to be very nicely made.  There's also a guy in 
Redmond (you are there?) who built the trailer for Wade Carter.  I'm not 
sure if it's for the 911 or 906, though.  Wade III liked it, and it's 
real low.  I don't recall his name, but you could get it by calling 
Carter VW in Ballard.

Other options you want to think about are interior lights, roof vents, an 
offside access door, walk on or platform roof, storage, aerodynamics, tie 
down system, electrical options for the generator, security*, etc.  Get 
the brochures.  The options and $ add up quickly.  That's why I haven't 
bought one.  

Of course the bigger and heavier the beast is the more you need to haul 
it.  I tow an open trailer with a MB Gelaendewagen, but I don't think it, 
or any generic Jeep would satisfactorily tow a large, covered trailer, 
especially for long distances.  Hopefully others with more towing 
experience can help here.  

*I read either here or in Pano about the PCA racer who had his trailer
marked Mobile HIV testing unit or some such.  Most people just don't
advertise what's inside.  I've thought about labeling one "Rabid Animal
Testing"  and leave my Akita inside when on the road. 

Hope this get's you thinking.  Let us know what you buy.

My and others' 931s have had bad bouts of the dreaded Flaky Fusepanel
Diseaese.  You might try wiggling some wires behind the panel (with
the ignition on), and see if you can find one or more intermittent
connections.  Look too at the fuses; they can tarnish/corrode and
become high resistance, even to the point of melting the surrounding
plastic parts.

Finally, my fuel pump relay flaked out on me once upon a dark night.
A paper wad in the relay got me home ;-) and I found some badly pitted
contacts and nearly unsoldered wires.  Check it out.

Email me if you need more specific info.

Actually, this arrangement should produce a good amount of oversteer, not

Barry,
you also have tax issues.  I took my 911 to London for a couple of years,
and the story (on selling it there) goes like this...

1)UK customs decides the value of the vehicle, regardless of what you paid
  for it wherever you bought it.
2)Based on that value, if you have owned it less than 1 year, you are liable
  for a whopping 17.5% value added tax right off the top to the UK.
3)Next you must pay import duty on it (up to 15%) at the whim of the 
  customs inspector it appears.  After asking repeatedly for 4 months prior
  to arrival of the vehicle, I received as many different opinions as people
  I asked in HM Customs.  Eventually I was told it was really up to 
  individuals discretion in some cases, and that it varied, depending on the
  port of entry.
4)You must have the headlights adjusted properly for driving on the other side
  of the road, and this may require some replacement parts.  With faster speed
  limits, you probably want to upgrade from your sealed beams anyway.
4)Next you must pay UK registration fees.
5)Then you are free to sell it.
6)In the UK, people do not pay vat on used car purchases, so you will not
  likely recover those funds.

Other countries require left to right drive conversion, but the UK does not.
It was fun driving it in it's US configuration, and I had no problems at all,
except running my car park pass through the machine on the wrong side, and
toll booths...

Other countries may or may not hit you with additional charges for inspections
and safety conformance.  The UK acknowledges that any car built for the US 
meets (or exceeds) all of their required standards.

All in all, in times of a weak dollar, you can make some money, but probably
not enough to make it worth the effort, unless you deal in volume.

Subject: 2.4S Tune-Up

Just finished adjusting the throttle plates and throttle linkage on my 911.
I adjusted the throttle stop screws so that all six throttle plates have the 
same setting.  I did this with a .5" x 4" strip of paper.  I turned out each
stop screw until the paper was locked between the plate and the bore of the 
throttle body and then turned the screw clockwise one quarter turn.

Then I readjusted all the throttle linkages to eliminate and pre-tension.
The only stop screw I couldn't adjust was on the #4 cylinder.  I couldn't 
access the screw with my 8mm open wrench.  Any ideas on how to adjust it?
So for #4 the linkage is the only thing opening the plate.

I started the car and let it warm up to 180degF and checked the air flow
at 3k rpms.  All six air correction screws were turn 3.5 turns out.  Surprisingly I still measured a higher air flow in #2 cylinder than the other cylinders
and lower flow for #4 cylinder.  I tried to increase #4's by turning its air
correction screw out but no dice.  I did not oberve a great enough increase
even at a whole 4 turns out!  Whats wrong here?  I did not try to reduce
#2's but I'll try next weekend.  

One thing is I have not adjusted the valves and this is recommended before
syncronizing the stacks.  Could this be the cause of the high reading in
#2 and low in #4.  All other cylinders were even.

One thing I did not get rid of is my fluctuating idle speed.  I measured 
fluctuations from 850 to 1000 rpm's.  I don't know what is causing this
but its very annoying.  Any ideas on what to adust next?

Overall the car does accelerate a bit smoother from a stop now.  I think
I made a good improvement.  I'll see if my mpg figures increase.

They came out of a 78 930. The front speakers are Mod.# HCS 1680 and

and the factory speaker grilles(black). The rear speakers mount under the

I'm  asking $75.00 plus shipping for the set. I have no idea what they 
cost new or how old they are. They sounded fine in the car. They were 
connected to a Blaupunkt Lexington deck. All of which came out of the

I'd also bet on the ignition I think the fuel pump won't run unless the 
sensor plate is lifted. This is usually after airflow begin, but you can 
remove the air cleaner and gently push up the plate manually. (This is 
often a fix for vapor lock) If the key is on, you will hear the fuel 
wooshing through the lines and the pump should run.
I had a strange ignition problem with my 76. The ground wire from the 
Bosch Box flexed one time too many and opened. Since the box was coated 
with that blue finish, it was not grounded, hence no ignition. You can 
tell if this is the case by listening for the "whine" produced by the 
high frequency switching circuit inside the box. I found the trouble 
while removing the box with the ignition. I saw a small spark from the 
box to ground, followed by a small wallop of about 350 volts through my 
hand! A small jumper from the groung clip to the screw mounting the box 
did the trick!

Subject: foreign prices, wide tires



	Regarding the recent discussion about exporting cars to countries
where they sell for much more, especially Japan- A big factor in the
larger price is the import duties and taxes plus the safety inspection
that is required on used cars on a very frequent basis. I lived in Japan
for 1.5 years and being a car fanatic, I was very interested in the
possibilities created by the apparently large price difference. The
Japanese have a very annoying inspection system/road tax called the Shaken,
which requires all cars beyond 5 years (I think) old to have a very
thorough mechanical inspection. Once the car has reached that certain age,
it requires this inspection every 2-3 years (or thereabouts). My car crazy
Japanese friends told me the inspection costs over $1500, and this is in
addition to the insurance and other licencing fees. When importing a car,
this test would have to be passed, import duties and taxes paid, and then
you would have to find a buyer. When all was said and done, the price
difference was not that great.
	Some examples taken from a early '93 Car Graphic magazine:
		88 928S4 6,400,000 yen = US$64,000 (roughly)
		90 C2    8,500,000          85,000
		88 911 cab 6,800,000        68,000
		73 carrera 15,800,000      158,000
		various 914's 2,300,000	    23,000
Granted, these prices are almost 2 years old, and the exchange rate has
varied, but you can see that with the exception of the 914's, these prices
aren't really grossly out of line. Another thing to consider is that due
to the high cost of fixing these cars to the Shaken standard, the used cars
that arrive in Japan are probably very good examples, in top cosmetic and
mechanical shape. That, and a $2-3000 transport cost, helps to explain the
914 price. After looking through a wide variety of automotive magazines
there, I decided that shipping my 356 over wasn't going to be my key to
quick financial success! Interesting to note that although they drive on
the opposite side of the road, approximately half (my guesstimate) of all
imported cars are left-hand drive. They don't require right-hand drive,
and the lhd cars seem to be more of a status symbol.

Narrow tires for racing: Up here in Canada where it ALWAYS snows ;-), we
use extra narrow tires on our auto-x course to get that extra bite into
the snow. It's an old Canadian racing trick, eh. Those new-fangled
low-profile wide tires just won't cut it. Gimme a set of 135 SR15's, and
I'll kick all your butts.

This used to be quite common in Australia - buy a US model at
25% of the local price and still leave enough profit to convert
to RHD and get certification for local regulations. Unfortunately
the "loopholes" in import laws were plugged up and now it isn't
nearly so worthwhile.

I strain myself to ignore U.S. prices when I come across them, as I groan
with pain everytime. At U.S. prices why doesn't everyone drive
a Porsche (or any excellent imported car)?

I looked at this pretty hard. Came to the conclusion that if I had
about $500K laying around I could make a lot of money doing this,
but that on a onesie-twosie basis, it sucked. Having converted a
couple of Euro-spec cars to US DOT spec, I have some idea how hard it
is to de-convert them... In some countries you just can't do it (Japan,
fer instance, has *VERY* strict laws about what kind of shape a car
must be in to be permited to be licensed -- it's estimated that 70%
of the cars on the road over here would be crushed and melted over there).
In some it's just difficult (left vs. right hand drive, some of the
TUV safety specs, etc). And then there's shipping, import duty,
and VATs...

I bring lots of clean rags to wipe up the inside of the air box on a certain 928

Subject: Porsche manuals

Kevin Hughes asked about workshop manuals.
 
I think there is a law in the U.S. that shop manuals have to be made
available to the public (but it doesn't say at what price). Manuals carried
by Stoddard and others are genuine Porsche manuals, in maroon binders. I
don't know if they are available on fiche. They should carry a WKD part
number (WKD = Werks Kundendienst -- works customer service).
 
(Later) Somebody else says they're available as fiche too. Fiche is lots
cheaper, but less handy when you're working on the car.

Subject: Sale of '62 Karmann hardtop

Hi, Pete.
 
If your Karmann hardtop really, truly needs a new floor, longitudinals,
lockposts, and battery box, it's a parts car.
 
Nobody wanted Karmann hardtops when they were new, and time has not made
them more desirable. Sorry. They're rare, and there's a reason for that.
 
My advice would be to sell it as a package of parts, or if you have the time
and inclination sell the mechanicals off separately. You might get more
money if the bits are in good shape -- engine, trans, suspension, interior,
etc. Then all that's left is a rusty shell, good for fenders and doors, maybe
a roof if there's another Karmann hardtop in need (not very likely).
 
Prices -- as a really badly rusted parts car, 3, maybe 4K tops. As a la
carte items, maybe a little more, but over a long period of time and many
swap meets. Engine 1K? Trans maybe same? plus whatever else goes.

Subject: Porsche prices overseas

The one big thing that prevents everybody "over there" (wherever "there" is)
from buying used Porsches "over here" is import duties. The customs
inspectors at the port or border are not completely stupid, they have a book
of car values or whatever, and won't let the car in until the duty is paid.
I have a friend in Australia who imported his '77 S and '78 928 and had to
go through the whole sky-high duty thing on them, even as used cars.
 
See, the Australians want to promote their domestic auto industry, so they
put a heavy duty on imports. Like Porsches compete with the things they
build, right? If people see the prices of Porsches, will they be more likely
to buy their ugly little Mercury Capri? Not...

Subject: Loctite activator

Hi, Tom.
 
I think the Loctite Activator is not a hardener, just an accelerator. Most
people don't use it. I spent two months while working at Bosch trying to
find a way to make various forms of Loctite set faster, and accelerator was
one of the methods tried. It turns out that no matter what you do, the stuff
I was testing (forget number, just used for studs, not seals) needs 24 hours
to set, no matter what.
 
This project wasn't my idea, just my boss.' He didn't understand how Loctite
works anyway, so I got the busywork project. This guy was a shining example
that idiocy is not a monopoly of the American educational system. He had a
Ph.D. but had trouble with big words. One brilliant idea was that maybe the
air wasn't getting to the loctite to harden it, I should drill vent holes
and see if that makes it harden faster. I explained to this Herr Doktor that
Loctite is an anaerobic adhesive. "Was ist das?" Uh, it hardens under
absence of air, in the presence of metal. "Oh, OK. Well, maybe the air can't
get away from the Loctite. Drill vent holes anyway."

Hi,

I remembered the 356 brake discussion we had some month ago and bought the 
Superbeetle master cylinder some weeks ago. It is a bit difference from the 
original cylinder. It has 5 or 6 outlets, and is bigger than the original piece.

After i checked the condition on the '58's original cylinder I decided to 
stick with it. Even if this only gives me one circuit. I want it to be 100% 
original. The '58 will be a 'Sunday Driver' and wont see much action. I'll 
rather put the superbeetle piece in my '60 model.

By the way I've started restoring the '60 too now, and I'm taking more 
pictures for the '356 Chassi restoration manual' I'm writing. I'm going to 
include the chassi manual in my 'Homepage' whenever I get the chance to edit 
a bit.... 

Cheers,

You don't have to stick with original size.  Without getting in to width 
discussions, you could upgrade with a +0 conversion to 205/60VR15 if the 924S 
body style will handle it and this lowers the car 1/3".  BFG Comp T/A will be 
your best value with decent wear, wet handling and dry performance.   I 
currently have Dunlop D40/M2, they're OK but I've heard at least 2 people 
mention them detreading and ripping fenders at the track.   For excellent dry 
performance, Bridgestone RE71 are great and are available from Tire Rack in 
205/60VR15 for $78.

Found the connector.  It was connected.  I disconnected it with no 
results.  The problem is not with the blower (the fan switch is burned 
out and disconnected completely at this point) but with the compressor 
running in the engine compartment.  The quest continues . . . .

To: porschephiles@tta.com
Club of America will host an autocross at the Galeville Drop Zone,
near Walkill, New York.  The course has been designed as a fast, flowing
course, with median times of 45 seconds in mind.

The Galeville Drop Zone is a favorite of autocrossers in the northeast,
providing a surface similar to that of Salina, where the SCCA Solo II
nationals are held each year.

Past drivers of note that have attended our autocrosses include: Mike Piera,
Roger Johnson, Lynn Rothney Kozlak, and Chris Bernard.

We always get a wide cross-section of cars and drivers, but provide trophies
for novice and ladies classes.

Directions:     Interstate 84 to Exit 8 (between NYS Thruway 
and  Newburgh-Beacon Bridge); go west onto Route 52 and follow 
through  Walden.  One and a half miles out of Walden, turn 
right off Route 52 at the stop light. At the first 4-way stop 
intersection, turn left and follow for about 2 miles to the 
next 4-way stop intersection and turn right.  Go past Blue 
Chip Farms and after the fence ends, turn  right into the 
entrance gate.  The sign says "Special Operations Training 
Center".

Registration starts at 9:00 am, first car off at 11:00 am.

    Ohayo Gozaimasu ! I looked a lot (like billions of others) at importing 
  to the US back in '85, when a pound was $1.05, the DM was about 30cents,
  and a Ferrari 512bb was 28k pounds. You'd be surprised how easy it is to  
  understand what "Lamborghini Countach, Totalschladen" in the classfieds in
  Auto Motor und Sport means even if you don't know a lick of German....
    This I know and guess about Japan;
  1. Their EPA is probably about like California reqts. Virtually
    every type of car has been certified in Japan, you could get a
    parts catalog and find the exceptions for Japanese models.
  2. You don't have to convert to right hand drive. You do have to put
    mirrors on the fenders (not on the doors). You also have to put on
    a buzzer that pulses when you get above 100km/hour. (Japanese in

    actually burrow down the highways with them blaring along....).
  3. Shipping is probably about $1500, or not much more than it costs to use
     a good transporter across the US. 
  4. Japan is full of imported stuff. Virtually every motorcycle over 400cc
     is imported to Japan (yes, that Ninja in Ikebukuro was probably bought
     in California). Harleys can't stay in stock. Camaros are popular but are
     known as the cars that the Yakuza drive.
  5. Unless you speak fluent Japanese, and have the patience to deal with 
     Customs, and have a route to sell the car, you will probably go crazy
     trying to export something to Japan. I have imported (from Taiwan) 
     a couple times, dealing with US Customs was probably the most frustrating
     thing I'd ever done. I'd imagine the domain of importing to Japan
     belongs to a well-connected few.
                                  
        So instead of exporting to Japan to get rich, just imagine that       
   instead (since gas and the cars are cheap here) that you really -are- 
   rich and be thankful that a whole lot of cool cars ended up here during
   the 80's export shuffle...

Subject: 944S *cold* starting problem

I've been reading all these reports of all these 944 hot-starting problems 
with some interest, and then I read this from  "Weeks Jr, James P (Jim)" 
<jpweeks@hsv26.pcmail.ingr.com>:

- -- ..I was accellerating ( rapidly) throught the gears and suddenly nothing..no 
- -- engine
- -- no warning, just the radio suddenly blaring in my ears..after doing a 
- -- complete electrical check or as much of one that could be done at 1:30 AM on 
- --  deserted road in North Al..I sat in the car with nothing but the key 
- --  flipped on..and noticed that I didn't hear the pleasant hum of the fuel 
- --  pump..might be worth looking into..

I've been having just the opposite problem with my '87 944S: it doesn't like
to start when it's cold.  It always takes several tries every morning before
it starts.  I haven't noticed any correlation between outside temp or humidity,
although I did notice that if I drive the car hard before I park it, it starts
right away in the morning.  One thing I have listened for, though, is the fuel
pump.  I've never heard it.  I can hear the ventilation fan (sometimes too well,
but that's another problem), but no fuel pump.  I assumed it was mechanical, but
now I know it isn't.  And yet once the car starts, it runs just fine, so I
can't believe the pump's not running.

So does anyone have any idea why a 944 would fail to fire when it's cold?  It
cranks just fine, just refuses to catch.  Guess it's time to yank the plugs and
see if they're OK.  That's if I can figure out how to get those d*mn plug wires
off...

Subject: 944 + Alpine = No AM 

All:

Just put an Alpine head unit into my 944 (85.5).  Everything
seems fine, except receiving AM stations.  Sounds as if
there is no antenna attached.

I read something recently about the in-windshield antenna being
a little tricky sometimes.  The only attachment to the antenna
I made was via the shielded, normal looking antenna plug.

All else, including good FM reception, is fine.  Am I overlooking
something obvious?

I have to say, the wiring diagram in the Haynes manual was not
very accurate in terms of wire colors.  It also mententioned
a white wire coming from antenna.  I did not see this
wire in my car.  Does it have something to do with AM signals?

Thanks!

I faced the same problem on my '71 911E rebuild. The solution was
different than the one Bob described as my top piston ring gap was
probably more worn. The pistons were in very good condition except for
the top gap being too large. The top edge of the piston ring groove was
rounded as well.  I told the shop manager I was not planning to race
the car and expeced to drive 3K - 5K miles per year. He suggested the
following plan to avoid the expense of new pistons.

Careful measurements showed the rounded edge could be machined away and
an American ring could be ordered to leave a gap of .001-.002 when
combined with a standard Porsche ring. (that's right... two rings in
one groove) The spacer ring has a smaller diameter than the Porsche
ring so it does not protrude beyond the piston wall. I was told it was
unwise to use a top ring that was significantly wider than the standard
911 ring. The shop owner explained there would be slightly more "slop"
in the piston - cylinder fit and I should expect the rings to need
replacement in perhaps 50K miles instead of say 70K miles. The use of
synthetic oil and not driving hard until the engine was at operating
temperature could extend these estimates.

In order to reduce costs I decided to go this route. Onle time will
tell if this was a wise decision.

You may want to check the "ignition-switch" turn-on "12V" signal to the Stereo
before you dig into the Alternator/Regulator solution. Many of the new 
"digital" systems use a turn-on signal. The power to the deck is always on

Because shops work on *PAPER*. And more to the point, the shops that
the manufacturers make these manuals for are their dealer shops. You
need to be able to carry the book around, to prop it open showing some
key diagram to where you can see it as you crawl under the car doing
some operation that you don't do very often. And, frankly, you need
the cost for doing this to be reasonable. Paper is reasonable. Fiche
is even more reasonable, but not nearly as useful in the main.

I've *built* state-of-the-art electronic hypertext documentation and
diagnostic facilities for military vehicle maintenence facilities. By
the time you add the costs of a couple of 19" monitors on articulated
swing arms, plus the costs of modifying the service bays to accommodate
all this, and have picked hardware that won't go wonky given the 
environment it's operating in, you add a *SIGNIFICANT* amount of
cost to the process (M1 Abrahms "tank" service facility was $1.35M as
delivered in '84, fer instance)

	1971 Porsche 914 (damaged) for sale

lshapiro@north4.acpub.duke.edu  Leonid Shapiro at Duke University, Durham,
 NC, USA

I have a friend who just bought a 1971 Porche 914 with a 1 month old
engine and a new paint job and got hit from behind while standing at a
stoplight.  The back is pretty badly damaged... the insurance company is
calling it "totalled" and are going to pay him some measly amount of
money for what they think a 24 year old car is worth (which ain't much).

Can I give my friend any suggestions?  Does anybody want to buy the car
for its front parts and possibly the engine (I don't know how badly it is
damaged) to make him feel a little better.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Yesterday I ordered Volumes 7-11 of the Workshop manuals for my 85 Carrera
on fiche from TCM Publications. Don't have their number handy. They have
a small ad in the classified section of Excellence. If someone wants the
number let me know.

Cost was $45.  H'mm Martin paid $16 for his fiche (although that is for
earlier volumes). I hope this isn't an instance where the dealer would
have been cheaper for me!

Subject: Targa Top Redo Questions.


Hi Bob and porsche-people,

This concerns the Targa Top rebuild.  Kind of a long post.  Maybe others
can offer some insight.  Mine car is a 1981 911SC TARGA.

After this weeks (Boston Area) rain for the past few days, I
think I too am in need of a Targa top redo.  I garage the car at my house
most of the time, and usually don't drive it on rainy days, but
when I stayed over at my girlfriends house during rain, the next day the car
mats were soaked in water, as well as the carpet on the backs of the rear
fold down seats.  The interior is starting to smell musty.  Its parked on 
top of the parking garage at work now, top off, sun drying the interior.

The top is original, and the vinyl is cracked at the edges of the top 
where the folds exist, when the top is folded.  I just had this cars body
completely rebuilt to a RUF turbo-look, C4 rims, etc. and the top is the only 
thing that makes it not look like a new car.  (Except for the bellow bumpers, 
and the fact they don't make Targas anymore, do they?)

I do not have the cash for a professional top redo now, and I would be
interested in knowing how you did yours.  I have leaks along the
back, where it interfaces with the Targa bar, and in some places up
front.  Also, it does not come all the way into contact with the tops of the
small windows on the doors.  Water comes in here when driving sometimes.
I have not inspected the seals of the Targa top itself, but the Targa Bar 
seal seems a little dried out, as does the targa bar driver door seals.    

I want to replace the vinyl more than anything else, since that does
not look too great.  My headliner is sagging in most places too, I have
packed sponge rubber in the gaps along the inside edges of the top, to
pinch the headliner in place, works ok.

Here are some quesitons I have.

On the Vinyl Top:
How much was the vinyl for the top?  Mine is black (are they all?).
Where did you buy the vinyl?  Is it expensive?   What size piece do I
need (you buy it as one large piece right?)?  How does it "stick" to the 
plates of the roof?  There is stiching along the front and rear edges of
the vinyl top, giving the vinyl a stitched or beaded-like edge that protrudes
forward and aft over the metal of the car when in place.  How do you duplicate
this valence-like vinyl edge when replacing the factory vinyl? 

Headliner:
What kind of fabric is this stuff made of?  Is this expensive?  Is it needed
for any reason?  I mean, could I rebuild the top and just paint the
underside of the plates black?  Or would this look stupid?

Webbing:
My webbing (this is the stuff the lets the plates fold I presume) seems
ok, just from the fact that the top folds/unfolds fine.  Just the vinyl is
tattered near the edges, and I want it to stop leaking.  How does the
webbing attach the plates together?  Glue, Rivets, stitched?  I think if
I am going to rebuild my top, I might as well do the webbing too, so I
would not have to do it later.

What did you paint?  The metal edges on mine are the only things with
paint on them.  The folding bars seem like a fiberglass material, and look
like black fiberglass with strands of white in them.  I probably would
sand and paint these during my rebuild.  They may be cast metal now that
I think about it.

Did you buy new rubber seals for the top?  I think I would want to.  I
would probably replace the window side seals, and the front and rear top seals,
as well as the Targa bar and windshield frame gromets, and the little rubber
peg on the corner of each door window.  Again, not becuase they all need it, 
but because I would feel better doing it all at once. What do you think of 
this approach?  Is all this going to be expensive (maybe I should just
move to California so I don't need a top, take a chainsaw, saw off the
Targa bar, and drop a brick thru the rear window; instant Cabriolet!)?

I have not inspected the top in detail (maybe I will go out at munchtime
and see detail in how this is constructed), but you seem correct is saying 
it can't be that hard to do this job.  I mean its not an engine, its more like
a folding lawn chair.  :-)

How long did the job take you?  2-3 hours?  10-12?  I don't have tons of
time (in law school now), nor do I have alot of cash, so I am concerned
with cost of all the seals, and parts.  BTW, I am also missing one of the
handles to release the top.  I just use one on both sides now.

I would like to do mine before I store the car Nov. 1st. for the winter.  

If you could write something about this I would like to read it.  It could
go into the archives, as Targas are getting older, more of these will start
showing up soon I would guess.  

Thanks alot.

Depends what you mean by "better".  The fiche manuals need to be used in
combination with other stuff (eg bruce's book if rebuilding).  haynes
also helps, but be very aware of ommisions and possible errors.

I got one from my employer, but you can pick them up at places that deal
in used office equipment.  There are a wide range available from a simple
reader of various types, sizes quality etc to ones with xerox copiers
built in to make paper versions of the fiche.

  >I have been reading your posts with great interest. I assume you have or will
  >describe your engine out/in procedure. I want to start with valve gap adjust
  >(clearance) is it best to do them in pair?
Engine removal and disassembly was posted already.  I expect to post the
reassembly stuff in a week or two.  The procedure for setting your
valve clearances is pretty well described in the Haynes book.  I'd offer the
following also:

        go to an industrial supply house and pick up some "shim stock" or
        large feeler gauges.  these are 12" x .5" and look like a hacksaw
        blade size.  I'd get 0.003", 0.004" and 0.005".  CAREFULLY bend
        one end over to almost a 90 degree about 1/3" from the end.
        These are much easier to use than a regular feeler gauge, and if
        you break the end off you've got plenty more.

        do one side of the engine at a time.  with the car in gear and
        one side jacked up with the wheel off you can use a breaker bar
        inbetween wheel studs to turn the engine (spark plugs out of
        course).  doing one side at a time in this fashion of course
        means that the engine gets turned over twice but who cares.
        MAKE SURE YOU TURN THE ENGINE IN THE DIRECTION IT RUNS !!
        You wont damage anything, but the valves have some "lash" and
        you want to adjust them correctly.  Remember to release the
        handbrake.

        remove ac compressor and air hoses inside makes it much easier
        to get to the inlet valves (actually, it's far easier to do the
        valves with the engine out :-)).

        go to a porsche dealer and get their valve cover gasket set.
        they are the good (green) gaskets and it comes with all new
        washers and nylock nuts.  s/b around $30

        if you can afford it, go get a small (in length) torque wrench.
        armstrong (i think it's them) have one with a 3/8 drive, 8-120
        ft/lbs ratchet type that's 9.5 inches long.  that way you'll
        be able to torque the cover nuts back on without doing it by
        guess and golly.  You also need a stubby screwdriver.

        too loose is better than too tight.

David,
	The G-50 was new in 1987, and is considered to be an improvement
	over the earlier transmisions in that it can handle more torque,
	and uses GM style synchroniser rings instead of the Porsche style
	which were pretty fragile as witnessed by the number of early

	the earlier transmission. I believe it is the bassis for the Carrera 4

	The noise is apparently due to increased clearances in the gear train
	which cause funny vibrations during low speed, low load conditions,
	but perfectly harmless and goes away at high speed. So the fix is
	to drive that baby hard! Enjoy.

    Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  I know a couple of 911 pilots
who never quite got the course figured out.
    Besides, I think it was a 914 course, anyway.  Even better,
a 914/4 course!  I mean, Ray Scruggs is no slouch!  It seemed
like he was just out of the power band for his engine, while the
four's, like Curtis Robertson (apologies if I'm mis-spelling or
mis-remembering) were right on theirs in the "good" places.
    Just about any course with *two* slaloms in it and three
sweepers/hairpins (depends upon how you look at 'em and how you
drive 'em) is something of a 914 course.
    For those of you who didn't know, our own Jim Pasha designed
the course for Sunday.  Thanks, Jim!  I had a wonderful time on
it!
    It was also good to see Hank Watts take Scott Winders' car
out for a run.  The only not-glowingly-positive thing he had to
say about the car was, "I think you went too far when you took
out the understeer."  Now if Scott could learn to drive as well
as his car is set up, the De Martinis just *might* have something
to worry about!  ;-)
    TTOD was, as usual, Lloyd D. in Track Toy--a 914 with a 3.2L
Carrera engine, racing slicks, etc., etc., etc...  I managed a 2nd
in class, once again behind Bert Del Villano, who has set himself
up as my Nemesis.  I was only 0.7 sec back, though, so I think
that I'm within "striking distance".  If I can put together a good
run, and do decently on every part of the course, I think that I

Japan does not make you convert, and oddly enough not only are most 911's 
you find in Tokyo LH drive, so are UK luxury cars like Rolls.  For exotic 
cars, the Japanese seem to like the US LH side drive style, but for 
everyday cars, they prefer the convenience of RH drive for tolls etc., 
which is one of the reason the US RH drive cars never were a big hit there.

I think that the hole (pun) idea behind the vernier coupling depends on
there being a different number of holes in each piece.  I thinking of
it in terms of the .001" markings on my vernier caliper, the distance
between each mark/hole is slightly more/less (depending which was you're
going) than the previous/next one.

Is what you are saying that there is some sort of multiplier effect based
on the initial sprocket hole selected ?  I can't think how this would work
can you give me details ?  Have you been able to get significantly greater
resolution than .013" ?

If this was some sort of designed in feature, I'd expect it to be documented
and also that there would be some sort of index on the sprocket as well
as on the "gear" (the woodruff keyway is the index there), but it'd
be nice to get better resolution, though I don't think .002" between the
two cams is very critical.  Stan, Bruce, Kevin ?

John,

Thanks very much for the additional information. Knowing the details,
and that the condition is harmless, certainly makes it easier to live
with. I also noted a distinct difference between an '86 I was seriously
considering and mine when I was purchasing. Clutch feel, ease of
shifting (especially into 2nd), downshifts, everything felt more
solid in the '88.

Do you know if the '87 -> current models all exhibit this trait, or has
Porsche found a way along the line somewhere to silence it?

Thanks,
David

Subject: hardner for l-tite 574

There was some information posted regarding using a hardner to go along
with the locktite 564 sealing 911 cam towers.

This caused myself and at least one other 911 engine builder on this
group to suffer palpitations !  (I almost had to have a different
kind of valve job - my heart).  I called my source for this goo
(AJ-USA) and was told "Nope, no hardner ! Never had it, never will !"
He went on to say that he'd built a number of engines over the years
and never used a hardner ('course they all might had leaked like a
seive too!), that these anerobic sealers harden due to lack of
oxygen (then why doesn't it set up in the tube ?).  I was also
told that there is a different sealer used in the water-pumpts
which IS a two part mix.  Maybe there was some confusion about the
type of sealant being discussed.

Anyway, I think I feel a little better now.

Don't know about the life of 968 clutches but at least the replacement
should be appreciably easier that the 944/951 clutch. The torque tube has
sliding sleeves at both ends so that the clutch can be removed *without*
first removing the transmission. Heard about this at a tech session for the
968.

Some of the SCs (my '80, for instance), have an external regulator by the 
left firewall.  Replacing it is a snap.  One reason I've kept my original 
alternator rather than replace it.  I believe the car in question was an 
'85 though, so this probably is more of a trivia answer.

this stuff is OK to use, or if it leaves a mess on the wheel?

I still have a few K miles left on the tire, so would like to prevent an

Reprinted without permission from the B.F. Goodrich Tire Company:

Adjustments              To Decrease Understeer    To Decrease Oversteer
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Front Tire Pressure      Lower                     Higher

If you read this chart, Ted, you will see that increasing the tire size,
and hence the traction, in the front will decrease understeer or cause
oversteer, depending on the other variables listed above. This is true
because better traction for the front tires means quicker response to
steering input.

One of the reasons Porsche put wider tires on the rear of 911's was to
counteract the oversteer tendancies of the car. They also softened the 
rear spring rate to help this along.

So Ted, don't tell me to go read a book on this subject. It is clear
you have no idea what you are talking about.

Yes, that's exactly it! 

When a car hits the danish shores, first there's a toll on everything from
outside the European Union - I think it's around 5% (not sure).

Secondly there's danish taxes - we have a 25% tax on EVERYTHING from
toothbrushes to Porsches.

Thirdly there's the registration toll - that's another whooping 180%
on top of it all...!

All in all, it is calculated like this:

Original price from dealer: $10000
5% import tolls             $  500  (Only from outside EU)
SUM                         $10500

+25% tax                    $ 2625
SUM                         $13125

+180% registration toll     $23625
TOTAL CAR PRICE:            $36750

This is of course on new cars. On used cars there's the inport tolls on
the purchase price from cars outside EU and there's the 25% tax on top
of this.

When the car is registered the customs evaluate the normal street price
for the car in Denmark. Then you pay 66% of this amount in registration
toll.

Our emission rules are not very strict. Only cars later than '89 MUST
have a catalytic converter - that's generally the only rule. The cars
will be inspected on before being let out on the street, but that's
usually no problem.

In general it doesn't pay to import a car, except if you can convince
the customs that the car is worth nothing on the street, which is very
hard to do.

The easiest place to import cars from (to Denmark) is definately Germany!
Here you avoid both the import tolls as well as the danish 25% tax, if 
you have paid 14% MwSt in Germany.

On occasion, it can pay to import a '76-'80 model from Germany - but 
usually that's only if you want something special. We have those silly
little rules saying, that you can't put in an engine with more than 20%
more horsepower without paying new registration toll - and you DON'T
get the old one back first (no kidding)...!!! Therefore it pays to 
put in the engine you want _befor_ registering the car...

Phew - this got quite long, but I think you all get the idea. Exporting
from US to Denmark is probably NOT good business. From Germany only
on occasion.

I'm beginning to think there IS no answer.  Anyway, here's the most

because "IT" is running when the engine is not turned over.  I think "IT" 
is the a/c blower, but how can that be?  The blower switch is 
disconnected with all five wires covered individually in electrical 
tape.  By the way, NO  air is blowing into the passenger compartment.  

My latest discovery is that there is air blowing out the bottom of the 
engine compartment just inside and in front of the left (driver's side) 
rear wheel - from the place where the noise is located - when the key is 
in the on, but not cranking position.  

I'm desperate!  Anyone got any ideas?

To remove adhesive, I use 3M General Purpose Adhesive Remover (makes sense,

Should have it at any decent professional auto parts store.

     I wish I read your mail a year ago.  I should have done the top myself 
     as you suggest.  I had my top (including the headliner) done by Autos 
     International.  I felt that they could have done a better job than 
     they did.  Also, my top got switched by Autos International with one 
     from a later model car (different latches).  It was a total disaster.  
     It took a over a month to get my top back and to make it worse, it was 
     during the wet (very wet) season here in CA.
     
     Oh well, next time...

______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________
     
I completely tore down, cleaned, repainted and installed a new top 
and headliner this weekend.  It wasn't hard, and it came out fine.  It 
looks brand new, and fits on the car beautifully.  
     
I don't think there's any real trick to it.  Just go slowly and carefully 
and pay attention to how the old one was put together.  There's really 
only one aspect to reassembly that I would offer advice on, and it has 
to do with reattaching the "floating" plates by strips of webbing (I 
used seatbelt material, obtainable cheap from most fabric stores.) so 
as to get them spaced properly.  It's easy to do and easy to explain, 
but a pain to write out, especially if no one is interested.  If you really 
want my advice...let me know and I'll either write it out an e-mail 
version of draw a diagram and mail it to you.
     
If your top isn't in terrible shape, you probably won't have to redo the 
webbing.  Mine top was a disaster.  I'm sure it was the original 22 
yearold top, which the previous owner had covered liberally with 
gobs of silicon seal in a valiant effort to stem the leaks.  The headliner 
would more aptly have been called a head hanger, because it wasn't 
lining anything anymore.  Even the half roll of duct tape (applied by 
the previous owner, natch) wasn't enough to hold it all on.

Wheel questions
 
I have damaged one of my BBS wheels. It is an RZ329 wheel - a one piece, 16
inch by 7 1/2 inch gold centered wheel for my 1987 911. I am having a
problem finding a replacement! The RZ 329 wheel is no longer made. Since fate
has put me in this position, I have some questions about wheels:
 
1. Does anyone have, or know someone who has, an RZ 329 wheel for sale?
 
2. If I can't find a new wheel, is it possible to have the wheel straightened? I
undersatnd from someone at BBS that they approve reworking wheels if they are
sent back to their factory in Germany. That tells me that they believe that
wheels can be straightened. Does anyone have any information as to whether or
not this is really a safe practice and, if it is acceptable, who is the best?
 
3. If I can't straighten the wheel, are there recommendations about the best
wheels? I realize that style is very important, but there are a number of
manufacturers. If I buy 4 new BBS wheels I will spend about $2500; If I buy HRE
Performance wheels the cost drops 50%. What exactly is the difference for the
additional $1250??
 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am sitting out a driver's ed. course
because my wheel isn't safe, so I want to solve this problem as quickly as
possible.

Subject: Re: 911 window & door repair

The window crank on my 71 911 Targa wouldn't raise the window.  I had to
take the window and regulator out of the door to find the problem: the
pin that the scissors arms pivot on was busted.  The part is steel,
about an inch long and a half-inch in diameter, with a slot in one end
for a spring.

The nearest dealer, Claridge's in Fremont, said that I would have
to buy the whole regulator assembly for $200 to get the pin. :-0

Parts Heaven in Hayward sold me a brand new pin for about $25.

I cleaned the old hardened grease off the tracks and gearteeth
and put some white lithium grease on. The hardest part of the
reassembly was getting the spring in place around the pivot pin,
but I was able to do it with the window regulator in my lap 
and a pair of channel locks and a screwdriver.

Got all the innards back in the door and the window now cranks up and
down smoothly.

While the door panel was off, I also replaced the missing check strap,
which keeps the door from opening too far.  I got one from Parts Heaven
for $10.  The dealer wanted $46 for the same part new.  Neither place
had the original part, which is part of a shock-absorbing gizmo with two
coil springs.  It has been discontinued and it is now common to use the
check strap assembly from later model cars, which works ok with minor
modification.  The bolt spacing is slightly different, you have to
wallow out the two bolt holes in the door with a round bastard file.

The only way I had been able to keep the window up for the past several
months was by wedging things like wads of paper between the window and
its groove in the door - I eventually discovered that a 69-cent plastic
windshield ice scraper worked best of all.  Great tool.  Works well for
scraping wax off skis too.  This one has acquired enormous sentimental
value, I never had to worry about anyone mistaking me for a rich poseur
as long as I had this holding my window up and duct tape holding my top
down. I could, however, pass for an impoverished poseur.
I have a set of pretty good fake Armanis (for the glazed stare 8-)

Tonight I looked underneath the car and
noticed that one of the shackle grommets on the rear sway bar has popped
off its ball stud and is dangling.  The other side is pretty loose too.
Anyone replace these lately, know what parts are involved and their cost,
and how hard it is to pop the new bushings over the ball studs? Is there
a trick to it?

Thanks,

I think most of my comments to Rich Lambert in an earlier posting are 
appropriate here: 
 
Based on my experience, here's what I suggest . . . 
 
You may be passing up the deal of the century, but I'd say if you're asking 
this question you ought to pass on this one until you have acquired the 
knowledge you need to be a bit more comfortable with this type of decision. 
 
One other possibility would be for you to contact the local 356 Registry 
chapter and ask them to recommend someone in your area who is 356 
knowledgeable and is willing to assist you with the appraisal.  (The national 
membership chair is Barbara Skirmants at 810/575-9544.) 
 
By the way, one way to begin learning about the cars is Dean Batchelor's 
"Illustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide" ($14.95 from Motorbooks International at 
800/828-6600.)  Another resource you might consider is Brett Johnson's "356

Here for comparison listed below are some abbreviated descriptions and sample 
prices from the July/August issue of the Registry magazine:

      miles, new Konis, etc. $22,000.  (I know this car; it sold for the asking

Ted,  

You really just can't read, can you?

Steve said "Super-wide" tires in front would give you understeer...
BECAUSE the width of the tires would prevent you from turning _AT ALL_.
Only he didn't come out and explain his joke, figuring we'd all get it.

Scott, however, didn't get the joke, and thought that Steve was 
suggesting that wider tires in front _would_ make the car _actually_ 
understeer.  So what Scott said, in politely correcting Steve, was actually 
correct. But that wasn't what Steve was getting at. And Steve explained 
that too, a bit later.

Do you suppose Porsche puts wider tires in back in order to make every 
911 handle WORSE?  Ever notice that the more powerful the 911, the wider 
the tires?  Especially the rears? 
   
But you, having long ago figured out the vast stupidity of the Porsche 
engineers, discovered that it's better the other way around?  
Or maybe _your_ 911 is front engine/front wheel drive, and because of 
it's MASSIVE _front_ weight imbalance and outrageous torque, you NEED wider 
tires in front?  And, _of course_, in order to offset the massive drag of 
the front rubber, the skinniest tires possible in back?

Was this message easy enough to read?  Or did you find some sentences in 
there that I didn't write?

Gawd, go back to school, but this time take engineering AND english!

I use a 3M product called "General adhesieve remover" or something
like that, available at a body shop supply store.  It will take off
the junk behind stickers, etc, including the Turbo badge (which I
removed for detailing).  It is not too hard on the paint, but you
may want to buff the area before replacing the badge.

Your best source of information on this kind of thing is a 
body shop supply store - they know what to use for what.

Hi,

your antenna amplifier is not connected either:

1/ to the radio (look for a wire near antenna plug) 
2/ or the amplifier itself is not connected to the
 car's 12 V power supply.

In my case, it was both 1/ and 2/
that caused the problem.

As I did not do the installation myself, 
that's all I know.

No!  That stuff is intended to be temporary and just let you hold air to
get to the gas station.  When you get there the guy removing your
tire will cuss and spit because it stays runny and is now all over your
tire/wheel and needs to be cleaned off.  If you leave it in the tire
it'll settle in one spot and you'll have a tire which is waaaay
off balance (and the heavy spot moves so you can't rebalance).

In addition to the normal stuff already mentioned, I bought a 20 gallon tub at

a helmet, rain gear, food, and limited tools to track or AutoX events.  Then
while racing, it can be used as a waterproof case to also hold floor mats and

I don't know about the systems used in NASCAR, but I recently got a 
magazine called "Racecar engineering, Vol 4, #1" at the local
Barnes & Noble.  It had a supplement about data acquisition, primarily
for F1 and Indycar type racers, but it also had a lot of general 
info and names of suppliers.  It is published in the UK, but many
of the suppliers list a US address as well.

If you can't find it, send me a note and I will get the publisher's
name and address for you.

This magazine is pretty neat - it has a lot of high-tech stuff.
I can find lots of ways to spend money on cars after reading
the mag.

Kevin,

	While PCGB won't sell you the workshop manuals in any form (though
my local dealer, as a favour, did copy the "sunroof" section for me when I
was having problems), the USA has a "freedom of information" Act under
which (I understand) PCNA have to make the manuals available.

	The Porsche Club Great Britain have manual sets which are available
to members, and I'm sure that I am not the only person who has got a
suntan at the photocopier (intellectual property rights notwithstanding -
sorry Stan!)  "making" their own copy.

	As I'm now looking for a 911 (I had a 944 when I copied the set),
I'm strongly thinking of getting a fiche set from the US, especially as I
am only an occasional mechanic and can live with the inconvenience for the
price differential (around $30, compared with about 15 times that for
paper).

This clears it up for me.

PS: My car setup as was run last weekend was not ideal due to time and 
financial constraints, this is not an excuse, I told Winders this last 
week.  Don't think that I feel my car in it's configuration last week was 
what I felt the ideal configuration.  I am always improving it.

Subject: 911 valve timing

Most of my valve timing experience is from doing it over and over on my first
engine, but I THINK I understand the concept:  You've got to let go of the
idea that the sprocket hole that got you close has anything to do with the
sprocket hole that gets you right on.  There is a multiplier effect of the
two different hole-counts.  Let's say one has 30 holes and the other 29.  That
would mean there are 870 combinations, so that you can set your cam in incre-
ments of less than half a degree.  In my experience, that was amply enough
to choose from three or four points within the Porsche-prescribed range of
overlap (and from way too many points just outside the range!).

Good luck, and keep documenting your experiences for us, Martin and others.
I get good tips from so many of those "How I Did It" write-ups.

Subject: Barry Chapin's Targa Top Questions

Barry-
Here are some questions I have.

On the Vinyl Top:
>How much was the vinyl for the top?  Mine is black (are they all?).
>Where did you buy the vinyl?  Is it expensive?   What size piece do I
>need (you buy it as one large piece right?)?  How does it "stick" to the 
>plates of the roof?  There is stiching along the front and rear edges of
>the vinyl top, giving the vinyl a stitched or beaded-like edge that protrudes
>forward and aft over the metal of the car when in place.  How do you duplicate
>this valence-like vinyl edge when replacing the factory vinyl? 

They run from about $80 to $130 depending on whether they are made of 
domestic Haartz vinyl or German vinyl.  I bought mine from German Parts and 
Restoration and was happy with it.  As far as I know they are all black.  It comes 
with the beaded front and rear edges all sewn up, ready to install.  It's not really 
bonded to the plates, but allowed to move freely to facilitate folding.

Headliner:
>What kind of fabric is this stuff made of?  Is this expensive?  Is it needed
>for any reason?  I mean, could I rebuild the top and just paint the
>underside of the plates black?  Or would this look stupid?

The usual headliner is a fabric covered foam.  The fabric is actually bonded to the 
foam.  They run about $40 to $60, depending where you buy them.  It would look 
pretty bad to just leave it off and paint the plates black.  You wouldn't like it.

Webbing:
>My webbing (this is the stuff the lets the plates fold I presume) seems
>ok, just from the fact that the top folds/unfolds fine.  Just the vinyl is
>tattered near the edges, and I want it to stop leaking.  How does the
>webbing attach the plates together?  Glue, Rivets, stitched?  I think if
>I am going to rebuild my top, I might as well do the webbing too, so I
>would not have to do it later.

The webbing consists of two strips, each a few inches wide, and each running 
front to back along the edge of the top.  It is riveted to the plates, and glued down 
as well.  I used seatbelt webbing and 1/8" pop-rivets.

>What did you paint?  The metal edges on mine are the only things with
>paint on them.  The folding bars seem like a fiberglass material, and look
>like black fiberglass with strands of white in them.  I probably would
>sand and paint these during my rebuild.  They may be cast metal now that
>I think about it.

I painted the metal edges, and they are metal, not fiberglass.  Aluminum, I think.  
Also, the rain gutter is aluminum, and I painted that too.

>Did you buy new rubber seals for the top?  I think I would want to.  I
>would probably replace the window side seals, and the front and rear top seals,
>as well as the Targa bar and windshield frame gromets, and the little rubber
>peg on the corner of each door window.  Again, not becuase they all need it,

Move to California.  You'll save a bundle.  I replaced the front and rear seals 
because mine were in awful shape.  They weren't cheap, but I don't remember 
the cost.  Check any catalog.  I have not replaced the upper window seals, the 
ones actually attached to the Targa roof.  For my model they run about $100 each 
(which is insane) and fortunately, mine are OK.

>it can't be that hard to do this job. I mean its not an engine, its more like a 
>folding lawn chair.  :-)

Exactly.  Engines aren't too hard either, you know.  They're just mysterious until 
you actually do one.  That's pretty much true for most automotive things, like 
painting.  

>How long did the job take you?  2-3 hours?  10-12?  I
It took about 10 hours, but if I had to do it again, I'd guess it would take 3-4 
hours, and maybe the next time 2-3.  I just went slowly  

>If you could write something about this I would like to read it.  It could
>go into the archives, as Targas are getting older, more of these will start

I'll write up something when I get a chance and post it to P-philes.

You're very welcome.

Subject: 84' 944 new owner

     Hello fellow Philes,
 this is my first posting, so as Elvis put, "Don't be cruel".  First off,
 I don't know Ted - poor Ted!  Now then, I've recently purchased an 84' 944.
 This is my first Porsche and I'm really enjoying it!  I'm fairly mechanical
 but know little of German machinery.  The car runs well (timing belts changed
 4K miles ago).  "The Lady in Red" is great but I have some questions:
 
  1) How much engine noise should I expect from this car?
  
  2) How often should the valves be adjusted?
  
  3) Any recommendations on reasonable tune-up parts and quality shops in
     the Sacramento area?
  4) I've discovered a small oil leak coming from an unknown area in front
     of the oil drain plug?  (4 inches clearance justifies hydraulic jack).
  5) What suspension components (including struts) need changing after 10
     years?  Car has 75K miles.
     
       If you have any input, it would be much appreciated
                          Thanks to all
                              Steve.

Subject: Blower Noise SOLVED!!!


Ah, just another example of what makes this list GREAT!  The mystery 
noise is no longer!  Thanks to the philers out there, I started looking 
in the right place - the heater controls.  Took off the rubber cover for 
the emergency brake and heater controls and played around with the two 
levers.  Wiring checked ok.  The problem was that the brass contact for the 
driver's side lever was out of line by about 3 millimeters.  As a result, 
the lever mechanism was missing the contact when the lever was put to the 
"off" or down position.  It was just barely sliding by.  A screw driver 
and a few pushes on the contacts (passenger side was just barely making 
contact) to line them up properly with the lever mechanism and NO MORE 
FAN SOUND!  EUREKA!

My thanks to all the philers for their patience with my endless postings 
on this.  And special thanks to Blaine, Theo, Thomas Smith, Lou Nicotra, 
and Joe Fialka for your guidance and, ultimately, the resolution of this 
problem.

Stan, this is what makes p-philes so fantastic!

Subject:  Selling a Porsche to a non-Porschephile

Dear 'philes,
I have a kind of philosophical or sociological problem to throw before you
for opinion, having to do with selling a Porsche to someone who may not
appreciate it or may appreciate it for the "wrong" reasons.

My story: I bought a 1983 944 last fall, in very good condition, with very
low miles (17,300 documented).  It was a local car, I was able to talk to the
first owner's widow, etc.  It is the cleanest '83 I've ever seen, never run
in winter, etc.  It needs only a few things to make it a real star of its
type.

Shortly after I bought it, a strange woman came to my home and offered to buy
it "at any price."  My first thought was, uh-oh, there's a kilo of cocaine
behind a panel; her real reasons are given below.  I turned her down, but
thought it over and offered it to her at an outrageous price; she
counter-offered with a price 33% over what I'd paid for it only two months
before.  Mind you, I paid a bit too much for the car to begin with, based on
prices I see on the list.  I declined the counter-offer, but it remains open,
I think.

Now, it seems that the prospective buyer wants it because she is a little
unhinged, and had a fantasy about a relationship with the first owner; she
actually became quite a disruptive force in that person's life, so she is a
dangerous character.  She wants the car simply because he owned it; it would
become a kind of warped icon for her.  Nonetheless, a 33% gain on the car in
a year is impressive, and would leverage me into a newer/faster/different
car.  The downside is having a nice, clean, low-mileage 944 in the hands of
someone who might neglect or wreck it, and who surely has no ability to
appreciate it as a car.  Who knows what weird "auto-erotic" rituals would be
performed in the secrecy of her garage???

As for me, the car is my one "hobby" in the midst of an extremely busy and
demanding career.  I gave up flying on this account, but have this "need for
speed" that the 944 suits pretty well.  I don't have time to work on it a
lot, but am fortunate enough to be able to hire good work done.

So, there's the dilemma: sell a good car at a fantastic profit, and move on
without looking back; or do the noble thing and keep it?  I await with
nearly-bated breath the collective wisdom of the 'philes.

Bill wrote:

..an American ring could be ordered to leave a gap of .001-.002 
when combined with a standard Porsche ring. (that's right... two 
rings in one groove) The spacer ring has a smaller diameter than 
the Porsche ring so it does not protrude beyond the piston wall. 
I was told it was unwise to use a top ring that was significantly 
wider than the standard 911 ring.

Interesting solution.  I don't think I would have thought of
using two rings in the same groove.  By doing that though, you
have  moved the location of the ring on the piston either
up or down depending on whether you put the 'spacer' ring above or 
below the actual ring.  Probably not a big deal, especially if you don't 
push the engine.  But ring spacing is a carefully arrived at parameter.  
It affects all sorts of things including power and piston/cylinder 
temperature control.  The top ring in particular is responsible for a 
great deal of heat transfer.  In my case, I only needed a few 
thousandths, and using a standard American 1/16" ring width did it.  

Are you now running with the two ring configuration?

    Hi, all.

    Now, I'm interested in Weltmister chip by AUTOMOTION. Because there are 
    some high performance chips sold in JAPAN but it's too expensive (about
    $1k - $3k!!). So I'm looking for cheap and good one.

    Recently I found the shop which sells AUTOMOTION parts at U.S.price in
    JAPAN, soon I ordered the catalogue and searched ... I got it! $350!!

    Then...

    Is there anybody who tried it for 964? 
    How was the impression?
    Or what else are you recommend?  

    Any advice I need.

Subject: Insurance for Porsches

Hi All,

With the insurance industry doing its characteristic computer
categorizations and lumping all us exceedingly safe and low-risk
Porsche drivers into a high-cost, high-risk, high-frequency-of-
claims-at-high-dollar-amounts pool which carries enormous annual
premium costs, I decided to investigate a little for lower cost,
but still good, insurance coverage.

I have found two companies (one through PCA) with drastically
lower premiums than, say, a State Farm, or Nationwide, etc.

The one through PCA is Leland West agency out of Fresno, Ca. The
other one is 20th Century Insurance Company and 20th Century
Casualty Company, out of Woodland Hills, Ca. Their rates are pretty
comparable, and both offer as good or better coverage as I have
now for about one third the cost.

Does anyone out there have any experience (good or bad) with these
companies? Or, perhaps you know of another one that you would feel
comfortable recommending?

Any info would be appreciated before I jump at the great prices.

Thanks,
David

Some resolution on the Locktite 574/hardner mystery.  There is no

is what I got:

LOCTITE Sealer in a bottle 574
For water-tight seals of cracks up to 0.5mm

Instructions for use:
Clean and de-grease the seal surface area
Spread the product evenly on one of the surfaces to be sealed.
Assemble the parts
When the metal parts make contact, the sealing action is immediate.
Squeezing or applying pressure is not necessary.

Air content in the bottle keeps the product fluid.

As you can see - makes no mention of a hardner.

Subject: Ruf steering wheel



Hello all,

Does anyone have a Ruf steering wheel fitted to their car?  I don't know if
there is more than one model, but it's the 3-spoke design that I always see
in magazines.  A local "performance parts" store had one of these on display.
Someone had brought it back from Europe and they were willing to sell it,
with no hub, for US$500!  I asked them what hub it would take but they didn't
know, saying instead that they could "modify" any hub so that it would work.
I didn't find this too particularly appealing.

My question is: are Ruf steering wheels made by another manufacturer such
as Momo, Nardi, or Personal?  If so, will any corresponding Porsche hub work
with a Ruf steering wheel?  I am considering one of these for my '86 951.

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: On torque wrenches

One item that may be of interest:

I own an old beam type torque wrench and several cheezy Pep Boys
clickers.

I use the beam type for calibrating the clickers by putting a 17mm
straight allen in sockes on each wrench, then clamping the beam type in
a vise by the pivoting handle.


One of the 1/2" is permanently set to 94 (which reads 101) for wheels.

The other 1/2" is used for when I need > 35 ft-lbs

The 3/8" is used for approximately < 35 ft-lbs.

Interestingly enough, the cheap ($17.00) 3/8" is dead on accurate
between about 10 and 40.  The 1/2" is light by about 2 ft-lbs across
the board.

I guess ht e point is that the beam type (being that steel has the same
stiffness no matter how it's abused) can be used as a calibrator, once
it's determined accurate.

FYI,
	Steve

Subject: Re: Tool Questions

These are my opinions, and I'm a self proclaimed incompetent:

See my note on torque wrenches.  94 ft-lbs is the ticket.  Imparts has
a nice cheap torque wrench that comes in a handy case.  Throw out the
extension and adapter though.  Looking for bruised knuckles.

You are better off with a NICE 1/2" drive 19mm impact socket than a
soft socket.  The soft socket, though it won't scratch, will wear out
quickly. Beware of the ones with the nylon inserts.

If you're pulling wheels alot it would be a wise idea to get a GOOD 12V
cordless drill and have a 3/8" extension lathed to fit.  Makes pulling
the wheels MUCH faster.  The put out enough torgue to put on the wheels
and lower the car, the final can be done with above wrench.  Again, I'd
use a 6pt socket.

Jack Plate:  I have one that I've not seen for sale.  It's a 944 pad
with a peice of bar stock welded to it the same size as the receiver.
Why?  Because the 944 pads have a lip that allows you to put the entire
head of a portable floor jack inside it.  I've seen cars slide off the
flat 911 style jack pads.  Not pretty.

Please forgive the non-automotive bandwidth, but I have come to view you all as 
friends, and I need the catharsis of unburdening my self to my friends.  Some of
you  may have noticed my signature line "Feline Varmints Spike & Felix" from
previous posts.  No longer.

On Wednesday, August 24, 1994, I had to put my best friend to sleep. 

Spike was 22 1/2 years old.  He was a cat's cat, yet completely devoid of 
those negative qualities we humans normally refer to a cattiness.   A small 
red forest god, master hunter, irrepressible free spirit, fierce warrior, 
impeccable gentleman:  he was all these.  He was our treasure, the greatest 
joy of life for both my wife and me, second only to that we share in each 
other's love.

The last two weeks have been pretty well filled with Spike, as we dealt with
the ravages of his diabetes, which caused him progressive nerve degeneration 
in his hind-quarters, leading finally to the loss of his ability (or 
willingness) to evacuate his bowels.  This left no option than to give him the 
last loving act of kindness, the freedom for unremitting suffering obtainable 
only with death.  

He had a lovely and loving end.  He was relaxed, and happy, stuffed and satiated
with his favorite goodies long denied because of his diabetes.  His end came 
swiftly, just after 1:00 PM in our yard, a clearing in his beloved forest, in my
arms, on a day of otherwise breathtaking beauty. 
 
Although he will always live in our hearts, Dora and I miss him beyond telling. 

Rest in Peace, Spike old friend.  And to the group, Thank you for your 
indulgence.

Gerald, I was considering paying $60 for a Craftsman, but was told that 
the Imparts $25 one with extension is fine for torquing wheels.  I 
ordered one last week, but haven't received it.  I believe the specs for 
factory fuchs are 94 ft lbs.

I got no replies to the above, (not even from the know it all Pete A., 
writer for 'Road & Crack', America's premier auto mag. for idiots), but 
decided against the Automotion one when they tried to tell me the price 
had gone up $10 since their most recent catalog came out, and tried to 
push retail on me at their 20% off sale.  

I ordered a Stoddards one last week also, it should be here shortly.  I'd 
also recommend HRS wheel locks, though maybe not for use while racing, 
they might offset your balance slightly.

David wants further input on reasonable insurance for our cars. 
 The past few years, I have beening using Hagerty Classic Auto Insurance here
in Michigan. They are based in Traverse City, Michigan. Phone Number is:
800-922-4050. I don't know if they insure outside of Michigan, however, I
would think so since they have an underwriter in New England. 
My experience is with two cars that had polices with them. I had a 1976 912E
all original with 19K on it Cost for a years' insurance was the high $300s
My other car is a 1991 Lotus Elan with 5K miles on it. My cost for this car
is mid $400s
I don't think $700-$800 is unreasonable for yearly coverage.
This company did put some restrictions on the policy. Two which were most
important to them were; a mileage limit of 2500 per year and not used as a
daily driver. I am sure however, they have other policies with less
restrictions.
Tell them Denny sent you, maybe if enough Porsche people call, they might set
up a special Porsche insurance policy to Porsche owner's benefit.
Good Luck Let me know if anyone finds them to be useful.

Bob wrote: 
 ----- Begin Included Message -----

Interesting solution.  I don't think I would have thought of using two
rings in the same groove.  By doing that though, you have  moved the
location of the ring on the piston either up or down depending on
whether you put the 'spacer' ring above or below the actual ring.
Probably not a big deal, especially if you don't push the engine.  But
ring spacing is a carefully arrived at parameter.  It affects all sorts
of things including power and piston/cylinder temperature control.  The
top ring in particular is responsible for a great deal of heat
transfer.  In my case, I only needed a few thousandths, and using a
standard American 1/16" ring width did it.

Are you now running with the two ring configuration?

Bob

- ----- End Included Message -----

Good points.

I talked to my mechanic and he corrected my memory of this situation.
Most importantly, the rounded edge of the ring groove was at the bottom
edge (where the ring presses down upon the pressure of combustion) not
the top (as I had misremembered). The ring gap was squared (and
widened) at the bottom of the groove by the machine shop. The top
groove was not significantly rounded in my engine's pistons and was not
altered.

This means if the spacer is placed at the bottom of the ring slot, the
working ring is at the original position in the cylinder. That is, the
distance from the top of the Porcshe ring to the top of the cylinder has
not changed. Since the width of the Porsche ring is stock, wouldn't the
center postion of the ring be identical to a new piston? 

The spacer ring was purchased to match the diameter of the pistons so
it is smaller (but thicker) than the Porsche ring.

If top ring is critical for heat exchange etc., couldn't increasing the
width (even by only a few thousandths) have a big effect as well? My
shop claims they will only use Porsche specification rings in a
rebuild.

Yes, the car is running with a spacer ring in each piston. (1,000 miles
so far with no trouble. :>) We'll see what happens after 25,000 miles!

I do not claim this solution is as good as buying six new pistons and
cylinders. But my cylinders were in very good shape and the pistons
were otherwise in very good shape. For a factory stock E engine. The
shop advised me this was a reasonable compromise. Wouldn't they
have made more money by pressuring me to buy new pistons?

This is totally incorrect!  Ted, I advise not one, but TWO! cans of sealant.
Rumors have it that this is Jeff Zwart's trick setup that he's used to 

win several rallys and placed well at Pikes Peak in his C4.  

This will prevent you from 

getting a flat while racing, while also providing a protective white
coating in your wheel well if there is a catastrophic failure of the tire.
Once tire failure has occured, you simply toss the tire/wheel in the garbage
as no tire shop will come within 10 feet of the sticky stinking mess this
will create.  ;^)

Seriously, pay the $20 and get the damned thing fixed properly, if possible.
Driving on the edge with a marginal tire is dangerous.  This is true not 

only for the driver and automobile, but for any unsuspecting course 

workers perparing to pick up your cones.

There is an adjustment on the '73- windows.  There is a stop screw that

Be careful with cut-rate insurance for your Porsche.  Many of these
companies specifically exclude driver's ed events.  Some don't even
let you drive your car to work.

Sell that mutha!! Sounds like you have some kind of puritan hangup. So what
if she wants it for the worong reasons! And the more weird the auto-erotic
rituals the better in my book!

Sounds like a win win situation to me. Go for it. And just because someone else
is going to have fun that you may not approve of is no reason not to do something.

I have no trouble using my delete key or the customized version of

Personally, I find that Nguyen's words are much more fitting to the
marque.

And speaking of poetry - does anyone know what the Canadian regulations
are w.r.t. the 959?

I believe I came across one sulking outside the Ritz Carleton here in
Montreal - it had Quebec plates - it whispered "drive me" as I stood
there, it looking rather impatient to be away.  I had figured that we
had similar restrictions to those in the U.S. but it _appeared_ to be the
real mccoy.  It was only too late that I thought I should have taken a
peek for the numbers.  Besides... it was hard to get too close - what an
aura. Silver if you must know.   


Now, Stan, I know I said I was looking for a driveable fixer-up-er but...

I had Rob do a turbo replacement for me a year ago, with the actual
turbo rebuild done by a third party shop.  I was pleased with S Car

He works closely with the race crowd and with the Stainless Systems

20th Century is a direct writing company which does not utilize agents. 
It is a well run organization with a very low expense ratio. Claims 
reports have been positive. They have historically been financially sound, 
but are struggling at the moment due to prop 103, widespread southern CA 
fires and a general deterioration of loss results. 

Leland West is a broker as opposed to an insurance company. The program 
they are offering I believe is underwritten through Great American 
Insurance Company. If that is the case, let me know and I'll give you 
details on their operation.

Where ever you go, have them preorder MVR's so there is no surprises 
after the fact. I would also not cancel your existing policy until after 
the new one is issued. Once issued, they can back date the cancellation.

Subject: Older 911 maintenance  tips

NeilK356 asked if I had any tips on things to do to his new '73 911 S.
Here is a list of stuff I would recommend.

Things to replace and do on an older 911 (MFI model specifically) :

1. Flush all old brake fluid out and replace with good quality new fluid.
You may want to rebuild your front alum calipers with Stainless Steel
pistons. Not a difficult job, but messy.

2. Replace the 4 rubber brake lines at each wheel with factory or top quality
braided line of the correct (small) bore diameter.

3. Replace shocks with Bilsteins or others. BIGGEST improvement,
especially in rear (fronts last longer and are not as critical).

4. Clean areas around battery compartments to remove any acid, and repaint.
You may want to discard the stock batteries and get one of the new Gates
sealed batteries which will fit in your driver's side compartment (the other
does not need to be used). Hard driving will cause the stock batteries to
leak and ruin your car.

5. Wheel bearings should be replaced and repacked. The Haynes manual method
of tightening them is too loose, tighten them a little more or they will
loosen themselves.

6. Drain your gas tank and flush to remove all old gunk. There is a drain
plug under the steering rack cover plate. You can look inside with a small
battery powered flashlight (through the guage sender hole) to see it there is
any rust at the bottom (never exploded on me yet). If there is rust, you can
seal it and coat the inside with some high quality stuff (I have a can but
don't remember the name). The tank must be removed to do this. If you have
rust in your tank, you will kill your $$$$ MFI system. Also change all fuel
lines at the tank when the tank is out with OEM or better lines.

7. Check your pedal assembly. The brake cylinder area may be rusty from a
leaking master cylinder. Clean it up and replace the cylinder if there is any
sign of leakage. You may want to rebuild the pedal assembly with stock nylon
bushings if they stick at all or if you had some leakage. The brass ones are
cheaper, but stick with stock.

8. Put your car up on jackstands and crawl all underneath it repairing damage
to the undercoating. A sharp screwdriver can clean up a bad area, then primer
and rubberized undercoating can be used. Rust 
jelly or remover can be used before priming to really get rid of any rust.

9. If your shifter is sloppy, you can replace the bushing which is under the
trap door between the rear seats. You can make a better one than the sloppy
factory part if you can machine a piece of nylon to fit.

10. Pull your rear torsion bar covers off to check the condition of the big
bushings, lubricate, and replace if necessary. There is an article in a
recent "up-fixin" (I think) that describes this procedure. You should buy a
complete set of these books and earmark pages of things that you want to do
in the future.

11. Check your CV joints' socket head screws for tightness, especially at the
tranny end. Some clunking can be fixed this way without replacing the CV
joints.

12. Replace your tranny fluid (when warm) with Swepco or similar tranny
fluid. Don't overfill, let it run out until it stops when you reach the fill
hole. This is messy and STINKY!!

13. Most people put the oil-fed Carerra chain tensioners on. If you don't
want to go that far, you can use the '83 SC type tensioners with the late
model idler arms to get the best possible protection without  adding the oil
lines.

14. Change your fuel filter, and all fuel lines in the engine compartment
with OEM or better lines. All other fuel lines should also be changed, but
are more difficult than these.

15. Pull your rotor off of the distributor and put a few drops of oil
on the felt pad inside the distributor shaft. Don't let any get into the
distributor. Also put a small dab of high temp distributor grease on the
distributor cam whil you are in there.

16. Plug or remove the hose going from the heat exchanger to the main air
intake (NOT the small one going to the injection pump!). Lots of rust and
road debris will come up this pipe and fill your air cleaner (could get in
your engine if your air cleaner is not sealed well!).

17. Drive it hard and often to keep it happy.

Subject: Trials and tribulations trying to buy a 911


	For about a year now, I have been hankering after a 911. The only
problem was that I still had a year's repayments to make on my 1985/2 944!
Having finally finished paying for it this June, I sold it privately (for
almost exactly half what I paid for it 3 years ago :-( ) in July and have
been looking in earnest since then.

	With a budget of about 20,000 pounds (ish) I decided that I wanted
a 3.2 Carrera Sport with the G50 gearbox and hydraulic clutch. Coupe,
Sport Equipment, leather and sports seats were essential. Turbo-look
("SuperSport"), immobiliser, limited slip diff would be nice. A Silver
exterior and any light interior (Linen, Cream) were out (I could never
keep it clean).

	The story from most people I have spoken to is that 3.2 Carreras
are hard to come by, with very few on the market. This was confirmed when
I rang *every* Porsche dealer in the UK plus every Porsche specialist or
Sports Car specialist who dealt in Porsches; I made about 60 'phone calls
and got details of about 10 cars which came near what I was looking for.
Most of these were either with the dealers (*very* expensive, mostly) or
had very high mileage (which I wouldn't necessarily object to, but trying
to sell on a high mileage car in the UK is not easy). Other sources of
cars were the Sunday Times, Exchange & Mart and the Porsche Club
Advertiser.

	The first car I looked at seriously was an '88 Carrera Sport, Red
over Black, 44k miles. It was being sold by No. 5 Garage in Shepherd's
Bush for 20,000 pounds and had an alarm and immobiliser, new clutch, front
brake disks and tyres. It looked OK, though it had a few stone chips and
the interior was a little bit tired. The road test was somewhat limited by
the new (fitted that day) front disks, which hadn't had any time to bed in.
Not a bad car, and in retrospect much better than I realised at the time
(it *was* the first car I'd properly looked at).

	Next up was another '88 Sport with 35k miles, again Red over Black
being sold by James Burke in Ruislip at 19,500 pounds. I really liked this
car - it looked and drove nicely and I was all ready to do the deal when I
decided to check out the service history. You guessed it - when it was
serviced in February 1992, it had 38k miles recorded!! I ran (not walked)
away from this one.

	By this stage I had decided that what I really wanted an '89 MY
car, with the wider rear wheels and factory alarm, so my search was
narrowed even more.

	I looked at an '89 SuperSport (i.e. turbo-look) in Thoroughbred
cars in Leytonstone. It was advertised as 65k miles, but when I saw it it
had 69k! White (not my favourite) over Black pinstripe, System 1 alarm,
lsd, colour coded wheels and priced at 22,995 pounds (it had previously
been advertised at 24,995, then 23,995!). It looked OK, but when I took it
for a test drive, the clutch made a clacking noise when I depressed it
fully. I was told that "they all do that" but didn't believe them - after
asking an expert, I was told that this means that the rubber centred
clutch has gone, and continuing to drive the car in this condition would
mean a new flywheel as well as a clutch. I may have considered this car
(despite the mileage), but they weren't too negotiable on price (I
suggested "high teens" but they said that the car had cost them more than
that and didn't seem to want to discuss price any further, even though the
car is still being advertised.

	On the same day, I looked at an '89 "Grey Linen Metallic" (Silver,
with a hint of Gold) with Navy interior being sold by Nick Faure (former
Porsche factory driver and veteran of 13 Le Mans) at 21,500 pounds. The
car looked OK (it had had a new drivers door skin, and was fitted with a
battery and front tyres which I had never heard of, possibly pointing to
servicing on the cheap, but was otherwise OK) but the colour didn't appeal
and I didn't bother driving it.

	On the way home, I dropped into my local Porsche dealers
(Lancasters, Colchester) who wanted me to put a deposit on a car which
they did not yet have in stock, with the proviso that I didn't have to
take the car if I didn't want it! As they wouldn't go below 24,000 pounds
for an '89 Black on Black with 38k miles, I declined their kind offer.

	Next up was an '87 (earlier than I really wanted, but with G50
gearbox) Black/Black with 43k miles at 20k pounds. The car had air con,
turbo wheels (i.e. 7" front and 8" rear) and cruise control, but no sports
seats or lsd. A previous owner had obviously installed a multi-speaker
stereo in the car and had then taken it with him, covering all the holes
with sticky tape, so the car would need new door trims and rear "parcel
shelf". It had also had a dual exhaust and third brake light fitted at
some point in the past, although these had now been removed. The black
paint was only average - a few small scrapes and stone chips (after having
a Black 944, I swore that I would never buy another Black car - they are
beutiful when clean, but almost impossible to keep clean) and the air con
needed servicing. I sorta liked this car (despite the year and all the
problems) and offered 18,000 pounds for it. The vendor said he would think
about it.

	I then saw an '89 with 35k in Red/Black advertised in the Sunday
Times at 23,995 in a Porsche main dealers (Lancasters, Bow). I arranged to
see it on the Tuesday afternoon, but when I got there it had been sold that
morning. What's more, they had got the full asking price (which I had
though a bit expensive).

	Went away for a week and on my return had telephone mesaages from
Lancasters Colchester ('87 with 44k in Silver for a whopping 21,900
pounds) and Lancasters Bow (the finance hadn't worked out on the car I'd
been interested in, so it had come back on the market, but it since been
sold again!), as well as the owner of the Black '87 who had sorted out the
speakers and fixed the air con and had reduced the price to 19,000 pounds
(I'm still not interested - the more I think about this car the less I
want one which has been the subject of so much alteration, unless it is
very cheap).

	I also heard about two more cars, both '89 MY and both
Black/Black, one a SuperSport with 67k miles at 24,950 (from a specialist,
Hadleigh) and one a Sport with 43k at 22,995 pounds (from a main dealer,
JCT600 in Leeds), but the SuperSport turned out to be an '88 MY and I'm
still waiting for details of the Sport.

	The search continues ...

As I wrote recently, the shop has had positive results with a 964
chip sold by Andial.   Andial is not, as far as I can tell, very
actively marketing the chip.  Testing on a chassis dynamometer
confirmed real power gains.

In case the name Andial is unfamiliar to you, they are, I believe,

I did some auto-x shopping at the mall today.  I picked up a nice $15

is guaranteed for life, and has 30 day money back guarantee.

I also went to Sharper Image and looked at their Boxster model, pretty 
nice, but I passed on it at $39 or so.  I did pick up one of their Video

Yeah, I took one to the last driver's ed event I went to.  The left rear
tire I thought had 34psi in it actually had about 25psi.  It didn't take
many laps to remove alot of tread from the sidewall area of the tire.

I've since bought a pretty nice gauge from Imparts for about $11.  

Now I'm trying to decide whether to try to get one more driver's
school out of that tire or just buy some new ones.

Ah! Watch this space!!! The Eezi-Bleed guys sent me a unit to evaluate

Just lumps of metal with a price tag. Get two. A friend will steal yours

Also, get a 2.5 ton floor jack from Sam's or Price Club or wherever. It
should be about $60. You'll love it.

Subject: re 914 door windows

Dave,
  Yes there is a way it adjust how high the window will go. There
should be a screw or bolt that sticks out at about a 45 deg. angle,
out of the bracket itself. It is toward the front of the door and
maybe behind some of the inside sheet metal. When the window is all
the way up this screw and the arm it is on tilt counter clockwise
and hits the part of the window that screws into the door, thus not
allowing the window to move. All of the above probably makes little
sense but hey, I am an engineer not an English major. Just roll the
window up and look at the only part of the window that doesnt move
and there should be a screw or bolt hitting it. That is what you want
to mess with. I hope I help and not totally confused you. Good Luck

This is a related-porsche question...

I am going to rebuild my bus engine in the near furtue, and since we have
some knowledgeable people here, I wanted to get opinions about gapless 
piston rings.  

How can they not have a gap?  Is it really two rings in
the same groove bu clocked differently?

How well do they perform?  Do they cause unusual wear at all?  Do they
cause writ pin problems with the extra compression/power?  Do they 
let enough oil thru to lube the piston properly?

I'm sure there are other questions that I should be asking but I don't know
what they are, so feel free to jump in!

Do the big rings go in front of the car?   :)
Will it run better with wider rings? :)

| From: Steve Wilber  <stevew@hprmohg.rose.hp.com>
|
|      Hello fellow Philes,
|  this is my first posting, so as Elvis put, "Don't be cruel".  First off,
|  I don't know Ted - poor Ted!  Now then, I've recently purchased an 84' 944.
|  This is my first Porsche and I'm really enjoying it!  I'm fairly mechanical
|  but know little of German machinery.  The car runs well (timing 
belts changed
|  4K miles ago).  "The Lady in Red" is great but I have some questions:
|
|   1) How much engine noise should I expect from this car?

I can hear a slight whine from my timing belts (they are also about 4K 
mile old)
in addition to the normal combustion induced noises.   If you have a noticable
vibration at startup or idle, suspect motor mounts.  I just replaced 
both of mine.
($139 ea from Zims.  Vertex is less expensive, but they charge more for 
shipping,
have a 2% VISA surcharge, and the guy on the phone was surley...)

|   2) How often should the valves be adjusted?

Whenever the engine is running.  That is, whenever the engine has oil pressure.
They have hydralic lifters that are self adjusting...

|   3) Any recommendations on reasonable tune-up parts and quality shops in
|      the Sacramento area?

nope...

|   4) I've discovered a small oil leak coming from an unknown area in front
|      of the oil drain plug?  (4 inches clearance justifies hydraulic jack).

and jack stands.  Could be the oil cooler seal.  Someone else mentioned that
there had been a tech bulletin on this.  Or it could be something as simple as
a loose oil filter.  I had a leak in this area (I also have an '84) 
that seems to
have gone away since I installed a new filter.  Some folks don't heed the
instruction to smear oil on the filter's rubber gasket.  They won't 
seat properly
otherwise.  The leak could also be a loose or defective oil pressure sender.

|   5) What suspension components (including struts) need changing after 10
|      years?  Car has 75K miles.

The aforementioned oil leak contributed to the degeneration of my right front
control arm bushings.  I'd check those on your car.  (I might be an auto racing
degenerate, but I just hate it when my car degenrates! :-)

Does you car bounce up and down more than one cycle after hitting a bump
in the road?  That would be an indication of worn shocks (strut 
inserts).  Another
poster pointed out that the usual shock test (pushing down on a corner and then
releasing) only tests the rebound damping and not the downwards damping.

Good luck with your new car!

If anyone's interested I didn't buy it. When I finally got to drive it, it
ran horrible. So I thought OK...it's probably just something simple. So I
changed the cap, rotor, & points and it still ran like sh*t. I gave up, went
home, called up the Maestro for advice and got his very helpful and
knowledgable assistant, Harry Pellow. He said to try a compression test,
change the plugs and adjust the carbs but, that it sounded like one or more
of the idle jets were clogged. I couldn't find a compression tester with a
long enough ..uh..deal to fit down through the sheet metal to the plug hole
so I just changed the plugs and adjusted the carbs. Now it runs like sh*t,
only not quite as bad as before. So I took it to a mechanic hoping it
wouldn't die on the Aurora Bridge (I couldn't go fast enough to take I-5) and
he poked and probed and said "don't buy this car. The front end is shot, it's
rusted real bad along the top of the passenger side rocker (under the rubber
on the door sill), and the paint's gonna peel off any day now."
So I didn't, but it sure looked nice to me. The moral is have an expert check
it out first!!! Thanks to all who responded to my question!

This will seem like a Novice question. It is.

I'm wondering how much deviation from original equipment tire size
I can get away with on my 924S. Apparently, most 944 take wider tires.
Maybe this is one of those 924S/944 differences that was bound to pop 
up one day.

Anyway, I think I'd prefer to put the car on Pirelli Zeroes, but they 
don't have my original size. A Michelin tire book listed my car as taking
195/65 or 205/60. 

Pirelli Zeroes come in 195/50-15, 205/50-15, 225/50-15 . 

So...using 205/50 instead of 205/60 will result in the car being 
10% * 205 mm = 20.5 mm lower. Thats almost an inch. The car is stock, but
the lip of the body panel below the door sure doesnt have much clearance. 
One supposes that a 10-20mm change is substantial with respect to the 
aerodynamic and suspension design of the car, since it represents a large
fraction of the ride height. Or maybe I'm just paranoid.

Using 225/50 would result in the car being about 10mm lower, or close
to half an inch lower. These may not clear the fender lips. 

Are these differences minor, or does this entail expert suspension tuning
and future trouble after Joe Bozo the Expert puts them on. 

I'm looking for excellent dry/wet traction. The Zeroes and the AVS Intermediate
seem to be the best choices. The P700Z is also good, and also has similar size
problems. The AVS Intermed. will fit, and is cheaper (195/65ZR15 = $87 ). 

Are the Zeroes worth the money ($150-160) and the trouble? 

Is a ZR vs. VR vs. HR tire getting me anything? Softer rubber, more traction,
less life is the assumed tradeoff. But, its possible, it does nothing at all
unless I'm going 150mph. 

Maybe I should try the Yoko AVS Intermediate and save the $400 for the 
next Porsche. Or the next repair :-| Differential is leaking, needs a 
reseal. I had them fill it back up for now. 

Thanks to those who replied earlier. Choices were culled from that, and
"Performance Handling" (c) 1991 Don Alexander.  Actually, was a little 
annoyed that it didnt address this tire size issue. It does talk about
tires quite a bit.

I have driven my 911 through the winter for the last
two years. This year we have another rolling object 
as well as the 911, so I won't be taking it out in the
wet or salt.

Given this, I took the 911 round my sister, who has an excellent
1500 psi jet washer. In order to get right into the wheel arches, it
is necessary to jack up the car, remove a wheel at a time.
Any way, I was happily blasting great loads of mud
out of the arches, when blinded by the flying crap,
the side of my finger was caught by the jet of the pressure washer.

In an instant the jet sliced into the meat of my finger,
only a couple of milimetre thankfully, I have had worse cooking 
accidents. Yup, Jet washers are excellent devices for epidermal abrasion,
and I would only use one with gloves and goggles having seen what 
it can do to meat.

The result of my experience is that I a going to open a clinic
for women who want `peeling' to improve their skin and 
get rid of the wrinkles. "Yes, step this way lady, clothes off,
just wait a moment while I start up the jet washer". Also
I am considering writing a cheap novel where a serial killer
offs his victims and then disposes of the evidence with an
industrial jet washer. Should make a good splatter movie.

David,
Great American distributes their products exclusively through the 
Independent Agency System. Independent Agents are business people who, as 
the name implies, are not affiliated with any one company. As a result, 
they can select from a variety of carriers (companies). Leland West 
apparently uses Great American for most of their Porsche Clients. 

I am not real familiar with Great American, but have not heard anything 
negative. Unlike 20th C, they are well diversified with both personal and 
commercial insurance. They also have a better spread of risk with less 
emphasis on California. This often translates to better stability in 
terms of pricing and better claims paying ability. 

When an agency (Leland West) develops a program in concert with an 
insurance company, there are often times restrictions. Be sure that they 
are not overly restrictive and don't prevent you from enjoying the car. 
Some have abnormally low annual mileage limitations.

MVR is an acronym for motor vehicle record. By ordering it before the 
policy is submitted and even before its quoted, you have a much greater 
liklihood of not being surprised due to an incorrect quote or rejected 
policy.

if I find one? (I have my own daily-use copy and one unopened copy for when
the first wears out).
 
There is an interesting story behind the fiche. Porsche North America did
that on its own initiative, sold it for I think $60 new. When the German

producing it, apparently because it was "not invented here." So PCNA sold
the remaining copies at cost.

Dave,
	The late model windows are adjustable. Look at the inside of the
door with the panel removed. In the opening just behind the window crank
handle with the window rolled up, you will see a metal tab with a small
bolt in it. When the window is rolled up, the end of the bolt will contact
the stationary part of the window mechanism, thus limiting the travel.
Adjust the bolt as necessary. I found that if you adjust it so that the
seal is optimal with the door closed, the weatherstripping will prevent it
from closing properly the next time. You may have to do some trial and
error adjustment.
	If you have the Haynes 914 manual, look on page 206, fig 10.47.
Look at the piece of metal with the winder handle mount on it. The tab and
stop I'm referring to are just behind the crank position, although the
bolt isn't shown.

      One trick imparted to me; don't expect your timing to stay once
    you find the right "holes"; timing will change as you torque down 
    the cam nut. Keep your eye on the the gauge as you tighten down.

      Another trick; you can use a spark plug to remove the dowel, it is

Subject: Crew needed for races at Road America and Dallas


Sports Imports Racing is looking for several volunteers interested in  
being involved in three upcoming races at Road America and Dallas.  We are  
debuting our Porsche 944 Turbo at the PCA Club Racing weekend at Road  
America on September 3 and 4, racing the next weekend at Road America (Sep  
10 and 11th) as part of the World Challenge series in support of the  
IndyCar race, and moving on to Dallas for a World Challenge race on  
September 17th and 18th as part of the Trans-Am Series Dallas Grand Prix.

The car is prepared to SCCA Pro Racing's World Challenge series rules,  
which allow extensive modifications beneath a stock body shape.  Other  
cars in the series include the factory-backed Kelly-Moss Porsche 911  
Turbos driven by Price Cobb and Mauro Baldi, three Morrison Motorsports  
Corvettes, several LotuSport-prepared Elans, two Nissan 300ZX Turbos, and  
others.  The races are one hour in duration, and are usually the main  
event on Saturday afternoons.

Anyone who is interesting in helping out at any of these three weekends,  
please contact me at "ulrich@canberra.whoi.edu" or at the shop at 508  
564-4995 (we'll be there all weekend).  The ideal crew member would have:   
knowledge of water-cooled Porsches, especially 951s, as this car uses many  
stock parts; experience with racing or race cars; and last, but not least,  
enthusiasm.

We are currently an under-sponsored and poor organization, but the car is  
fundamentally well-prepared, if not very developed at this point.  For the  
World Challenge races, you must already be a member of or join SCCA, but  
I'll pay for your crew credentials, which give you pretty much unlimited  
access to the paddock, spectator areas, and the pits for the entire race  
weekend.  I'll also provide a Sports Imports Racing shirt and hat, which  
will be your uniform.

I cannot provide lodging, so this probably is only practical for someone  
local to the races.

I will through in my .02 on this one.  Of all the "car" magazines I get, 
including Panorama, Excellence, OnTrack, SCCA SportsCar etc. etc.,  this by 
far and away, issue after issue, the most informative of the lot.  If you 
auto-x or club race this _IS_ the magazine for you.  They have more 
informative "how-to" articles than most of the other mags combined.  They 
don't just talk about the technical car aspects, but they also cover driving 
improvement techniques and driver profiles, too.  In their editorial section 
they work hard to cover those issues that are important to amatuer racers.

For Porschephilles, this is a great issue to be introduced to.  IMHO, get it.

Subject: Re: 911 Bump Steer

Yep, you've hit the point where your steering rack is below the plain of
the tie rods.  The geometry of the steering system now lets the upward
movement of the suspension exert more force on the rack which is fed back
into the steering wheel.

AutoMotion (800) 777-8881 makes two nifty fixes.

Part number RS-050 ($12.95) is a pair of spacers that will raise the
steering rack back up to where it should be, without changing the ride height.

Part number TK-930 ($209.95) is an improved Tie Rod, complete with ends
that are similar to the tie rods used on the turbo cars. These tie rods
will not, in and of themselves, cure the bump steer but they will make the
steering "feel" much better and more positive.

I'd install the rack spacers first then if you're still not happy, go for
the tie rods.

BTW, lowering the car *has* changed the cars alignment

Excellent suggestion (though my makita 9.6 volt works just fine).

I was able to find a drill-to-1/4" drive adapter.  I just epoxied 
a 1/4" to 3/8" adapter to it.

When I change wheels for an auto-x, I:

   Take auto-x wheel out of garage and place at correct corners.

   Break all lugs loose with the lug wrench

   Jack up one side of the car.

   With cordless drill: remove lugs, swap wheel, replace lugs.  

   Lower side of car.

   Repeat on other side.

   Torque all lug nuts.

Total time from opening the garage to closing the garage is usually
under 20 minutes.

I don't really care for the disk-on-bar jack pads either.

I bought a 12"-15" long piece of 1"x1" steel and had a friend mill one 
end down to 7/8"x7/8" to fit the jack receiver.  It's long enough that
the jack won't slide out from under, though it does slide along the
bar a couple of inches.

While they do occasionally have informative articles, I had to cancel my
subscription years ago because of their poor research of facts and amazing
amount of errors. Most of their "project cars" which were supposed to be set
up for SCCA autocrossing were illegal in several areas. The way they build
these project cars is to get free parts from manufacturers, put them on cars,
and later sell the cars for profit. There is no objectivity, anyone can get
rave reviews in this magazine... even cheap slave-labor manufactured Korean
Hankook tires.

I borrowed a recent issue which had info on cheap but excellent Ford
Heavy-Duty brake fluid, and checked to see if the magazine was any better. If
you have this issue, check the part about Vintage racing where they make
several errors about 911s in a few paragraphs. This magazine will never
improve unless it changes ownership. A clue is in their address : Motorsport
Marketing- it's all about money. They even tried to start their own autocross
series with a National Championship, you know how successful that was...

This magazine is bad for the sport of autocrossing. Please everyone let me

I had bump steer on my current 914 at correct ride height until I checked
the alignment and noticed significant toe-out.  When set right the bump
steer is gone.  I would think that either toe in or out could be responsible

Subject: 911 Questions '84-'89

P-Files,

   I am doing my homework in preparation to buy my first 911.  I've narrowed my 
search fairly quickly to the '84 to '89 range.  By '84 it appears that most of 
the gremlins of the earlier models had been addressed. (Cam tensioners, rubber-
centered clutches etc.).  From what I've learned so far, it appears that the 
'87, '88 and '89 models are identical, and the only way to tell the difference 
is by looking at the VIN.

   Does anyone know what changes occurred between the '84 to '86 years?  What 
was the change made on the '87 that increased the claimed HP from 200 to 214? 
(Curiously, I've seen reports claiming 231Hp for the '87 and later Carreras, 
Euro spec perhaps?)

   Does anyone have personal experiences to compare the hydraulic G50 
transmission to the earlier 915 type?  Pedal effort?  Reliability?  Smoothness?
Gear Ratios used?


Thanks In Advance,

   If top ring is critical for heat exchange etc., couldn't increasing the

   My shop claims they will only use Porsche specification rings in a
   rebuild.

   I do not claim this solution is as good as buying six new pistons and
   cylinders. But my cylinders were in very good shape and the 
   pistons were otherwise in very good shape. For a factory stock E 
   engine. The shop advised me this was a reasonable compromise.
   Wouldn't they have made more money by pressuring me to buy
   new pistons?

Sounds like a real nice solution.  In effect, the spacer ring has 
'patched' the piston. And I think you ought to be real happy with 
your shop.  They almost certainly would have made more money if 
you had purchased new pistons, and their job might actually have 
been easier.

As far as increasing the width of the ring by a few thousandths is 
concerned, my thought was that it wouldn't make any difference to 
speak of.  A 1/16" ring is a (perhaps the) standard U.S. size.  The 
1.5mm ring seems to be the metric standard.  They're darn close.  But 
you're right, they're not exactly the same.  My thought was that if one 
had to change ring width it would be better to increase  width 
slightly rather than decrease it, since decreasing it would reduce the 
ring/cylinder contact area and therefore the heat transfer.  I think 
that in both our cases we're talking about pretty small effects, 
especially if you're not pushing the engine.

Paul,

I would like to offer a suggestion on your tire dilemma. 1st, consider the
type of driving you intend to do. If you are autocrossing or SCCA racing I
would agree that an ultra performance tire would be the choice. Second,
make sure the tires you buy fit your rims and 3rd, check for clearance
problems with the bodywork. You know that a change in diameter of the
tire/wheel assembly will also affect your speedometer.

For normal driving I think V and Z rated tires are a bit of overkill,
especially on a 924 and for a value conscious person such as you appear to
be.

My recommendation to you is to stay with recommended tire size and purchase
the Goodyear Eagle GT II Radial. This is a new performance tire, very
affordable with good handling, traction, wear and noise characteristics. I
have them myself on a sports coupe and I have been really impressed with
them. Why spend a lot of money on an imported radial when you can get a
great US made tire that will meet all of your needs, including aethestics
in the P195/65R15 size?

At least visit your Goodyear dealer and take a look at them. If you decide
to buy them send me an E-mail note and I will send you by regular mail 4
coupons which will give you a 20% discount on top of the best price you can
negotiate with the seller.

Subject: Older 911 maintenance

NeilK356 asked if I had any tips on things to do to his new '73 911 S.
Here is a list of stuff I would recommend.

Things to replace and do on an older 911 (MFI model specifically) :

1. Flush all old brake fluid out and replace with good quality new fluid.
You may want to rebuild your front alum calipers with Stainless Steel
pistons. Not a difficult job, but messy.

2. Replace the 4 rubber brake lines at each wheel with factory or top quality
braided line of the correct (small) bore diameter.

3. Replace shocks with Bilsteins or others. BIGGEST improvement,
especially in rear (fronts last longer and are not as critical).

4. Clean areas around battery compartments to remove any acid, and repaint.
You may want to discard the stock batteries and get one of the new Gates
sealed batteries which will fit in your driver's side compartment (the other
does not need to be used). Hard driving will cause the stock batteries to
leak and ruin your car.

5. Wheel bearings should be replaced and repacked. The Haynes manual method
of tightening them is too loose, tighten them a little more or they will
loosen themselves.

6. Drain your gas tank and flush to remove all old gunk. There is a drain
plug under the steering rack cover plate. You can look inside with a small
battery powered flashlight (through the guage sender hole) to see it there is
any rust at the bottom (never exploded on me yet). If there is rust, you can
seal it and coat the inside with some high quality stuff (I have a can but
don't remember the name). The tank must be removed to do this. If you have
rust in your tank, you will kill your $$$$ MFI system. Also change all fuel
lines at the tank when the tank is out with OEM or better lines.

7. Check your pedal assembly. The brake cylinder area may be rusty from a
leaking master cylinder. Clean it up and replace the cylinder if there is any
sign of leakage. You may want to rebuild the pedal assembly with stock nylon
bushings if they stick at all or if you had some leakage. The brass ones are
cheaper, but stick with stock.

8. Put your car up on jackstands and crawl all underneath it repairing damage
to the undercoating. A sharp screwdriver can clean up a bad area, then primer
and rubberized undercoating can be used. Rust 
jelly or remover can be used before priming to really get rid of any rust.

9. If your shifter is sloppy, you can replace the bushing which is under the
trap door between the rear seats. You can make a better one than the sloppy
factory part if you can machine a piece of nylon to fit.

10. Pull your rear torsion bar covers off to check the condition of the big
bushings, lubricate, and replace if necessary. There is an article in a
recent "up-fixin" (I think) that describes this procedure. You should buy a
complete set of these books and earmark pages of things that you want to do
in the future.

11. Check your CV joints' socket head screws for tightness, especially at the
tranny end. Some clunking can be fixed this way without replacing the CV
joints.

12. Replace your tranny fluid (when warm) with Swepco or similar tranny
fluid. Don't overfill, let it run out until it stops when you reach the fill
hole. This is messy and STINKY!!

13. Most people put the oil-fed Carerra chain tensioners on. If you don't
want to go that far, you can use the '83 SC type tensioners with the late
model idler arms to get the best possible protection without  adding the oil
lines.

14. Change your fuel filter, and all fuel lines in the engine compartment
with OEM or better lines. All other fuel lines should also be changed, but
are more difficult than these.

15. Pull your rotor off of the distributor and put a few drops of oil
on the felt pad inside the distributor shaft. Don't let any get into the
distributor. Also put a small dab of high temp distributor grease on the
distributor cam whil you are in there.

16. Plug or remove the hose going from the heat exchanger to the main air
intake (NOT the small one going to the injection pump!). Lots of rust and
road debris will come up this pipe and fill your air cleaner (could get in
your engine if your air cleaner is not sealed well!).

17. Drive it hard and often to keep it happy.

Subject: Blake Breeder tools

Jerry Mac asked which Brake Bleeder Tool do folks recommend (if any)?

I recently got the "mityvac" brake bleeding kit from one of the Porsche
catalog companies, to help with my '72 911 S. It has the vaccuum pump and a
small reservoir. On the front calipers, it draws in more air than brake
fluid. The air must be coming around the bleeder screw threads, as it only
comes out when the screws are loosened. So it is not easy to tell when all
air is out of the brake system.

On the rear calipers, the pump will not draw out any significant amount of
fluid. Maybe this is due to the brake proportioning valve? What I ended up
doing  was pump up the vaccuum, loosen the bleeder screw, jump in the car,
pump the brake pedal a few times, jump back out and tighten the screw.
Defeats the purpose of using the vaccuum tool!

Any other comments about using this type of bleeder are appreciated.

Hi, Hunter.
 
re selling the car for a profit to this whacko:
 
Sell the car! At the risk of offending all the waterpumper drivers, note
the depreciation on your 944 (go to library, look at Kelly Blue Book.) If you
can step up to a 911, they don't depreciate much, if at all.
 
Absolutely ignore Ted's advice with the cocaine. 1) If there's cocaine in
there, you have no need to find it, as you probably can't/wont sell it
yourself. 2) If you call in the police to find it and they indeed do find
something, your car will probably be confiscated as evidence. Do not sell
for profit, do not drive Porsche, maybe go to jail until you explain it all.
3) If this nutcase wants it so badly because there may be contraband in it,
fine, maybe tip the police off regarding your suspicions after you have the
money and have signed over the title.
 
Have you talked to the widow about this? How did whacko get your name as the
new owner?
 
My advice: hold out for more than 33 percent over your price. After all, you
don't want to sell, but for enough extra you would.
 
Also consider that if this person is really nuts and somehow possessive
about this car, she may for some reason feel that if she can't have it,
nobody can, etc. and do something nasty. Let her have it for a handsome
profit.
 
Figure an 84-85 911 Carrera, which is an outstanding vintage, will go for
high teens to low 20s in perfect shape, and that is one of the most
desirable of all 911s before the current Type 993 (new Carrera) came out.

Are you saying to put a piece of 2X4 between the floor jack and
the jack mount point?

This is advice that, if followed, could injure someone.

Probably no list member would actually follow it.

But just in case...

Be very careful about using a block of wood to hold up/lift a car.

Wood is compressible, may have hidden voids, and may split.

Several years ago, a well liked local machinist apparently used a piece of 
plywood underneath a jackstand to get some more height while he worked
under his car.

The story was that the plywood had an inner layer void that caused the 
jackstand to tilt to one side.  The car dropped on him.   

His wife came home and found him dead.

For working on my cars I have this lifting/holding tool complement:

  2 floor jacks
  4 metal wheel ramps
  4 jack stands
  1 jack plate
  4 bottle jacks

I use the jackplate to lift the car so I can put the ramps or jack stands
underneath.

Avoid the $29.95 cheapie floor jacks.  I saw a returned one at K-MART with the
saddle snapped off.  Someone probably got a surprise.  The cheapie
jacks also have insufficient lifting range.

My floor jacks are Sears brand, (Japanese manufacture) and have never
been any trouble.  

The jack plate should not be the sole holding device if you're going under
the car.

Even if you are simply using the wood to lift the car so you can change
tires on one side, the wood can break and cause the jack to slip and 
damage the 911 rocker sheet metal.

Why take this chance?  

Get a jack plate and get the proper lifting/holding equipment.

Subject: Targa Top Instructions

A surprisingly large number of people have asked me to document 
my Targa top rebuild  experience, so here goes. I'm sure 
there are year-to-year variations in the details of construction, but I 
suspect that they're  minor, and that my 1972 911 top is typical. (long)

 1. The Targa top, sometimes called the skin, that you buy from the 
dealer or any of the after  market suppliers,  is a vinyl piece that 
comes cut and sewn to fit.  The front and rear edges have  the 
binding, or beading, sewn in place.  Similarly, the headliner comes 
cut to fit and it's edges are  sewn and bound.  There appear to be two 
kinds of vinyl that most places use, the domestic vinyl  made by 
Haartz, and the German vinyl.  The former has a coarser pattern and 
is shinier than the  latter.  I used the former; it's cheaper.  I also think 
it looks pretty good.  

2. The top comes apart easily.  Just unscrew the 
rubber window seals on either side, and then the  rain gutters.   You'll 
also have to remove two metal trim pieces on the frame, and perhaps 
fold  back some of the vinyl trim on the frame.  It'll be obvious.  In my 
case, the top was cut away from  the hold-down clips, but the 
headliner was beneath them.   So if you're just doing the top, maybe  
you can leave the clips in place.  If you're doing everything, and I'd 
suggest you do, since the  headliner is cheap enough and you might 
as well as long as everything's apart, then take off the  clips too. Then 
start ripping off the top, and headliner, BUT pay attention to how 
things were put  together.  Save the top so you can look at it if you 
need to during reassembly.  

3. The top has three aluminum plates 
that are held together and to the front and back ends by  burlap and 
webbing.  The webbing appears to be the strength member.  Actually, 
webbing might  be the wrong word.  It's simply two pieces of tough 
stuff, a few inches wide, that run down both  sides of the top, front to 
back.  I think the burlap is there simply to prevent the vinyl top from  
chaffing on the aluminum.  The webbing runs on the top side.  It's not 
woven between the plates.  

4. You can take apart the rest of the frame 
if you wish, but it probably isn't necessary.  If you do,  and you're not 
acquainted with auto trim techniques, you'll want to know that the 
plastic buttons  have a pin in the center.  The button is removed by 
driving the pin (use a nail, the head side on  the pin, not the point) 
through the button.  This releases the button's catch mechanism.    


5.  The webbing on my top was held to the three plates and to the 
front and back sections with  rivets and glue.  I replaced it with 
seatbelt material, available from almost any fabric store.  I used  pop-
rivets, 1/8" dia x 1/8" long.  This is one of only two places that I'd 
offer advice, although you  don't have to be a genius to figure out a 
procedure for yourself.  It really isn't very complicated in  spite of the 
popular wisdom which says you shouldn't touch a Targa top unless 
you're a  professional.   The plate spacing is determined by the 
webbing, and this in turn sets the entire top  geometry.  I put the clips 
back on the plates and aligned them with the unfolded frame, and 
then  tightened them.  The top is now fully unfolded, as it would be 
on the car.  Everything is in the  right place.  THEN I put on the 
webbing.  I also put on the burlap, gluing it to the three plates and  to 
the end pieces.  I didn't actually use burlap because the burlap at the 
fabric store was too weak.   Instead, I used a scrap piece of fairly 
tough material.  I don't know what it was, muslin maybe.  It  came off 
the odds and ends table.  50 cents.  

6. Now when you fold the frame 
you can be certain that when it is unfolded everything will be in  the 
right place.  

7. You'll have to remove the clips at this point, since they 
will go over the headliner (for  appearance).  But...you want to be 
sure that they can be put back in exactly the same place.  I  simply 
held the clip 'nuts' in place by gluing a piece of foam rubber over 
them and to the  aluminum plates.  That's what it looked like had 
been done at the factory.  The reason 'nuts' is in  parenthesis is that 
there is a single 'nut' for both bolts in each clip.  You'll see what I 
mean when  you do it. But after thinking about it I decided it would 
have been much easier to just hold them  in place with a piece of duct 
tape.  All this will be much more obvious when you actually see it.  

8. 
Put the top on, cutting away here and there as needed to fit the frame.  
Again, obvious.  Glue it  down along the flap that folds under all 
around.  You're gluing only the flap, and you're gluing it  to the 
underside of the top(the inside of the car side, so to speak).  I started 
gluing from the center  (of the front and back) outwards towards the 
sides, so I  could smooth it nicely, but I think it  would have gone as 
well had I started at either end.  

9. The raingutters go on easily.  

10. The headliner is simple.  Just put it on, it fits like a glove.  Use a 
little glue to hold it to the top.   You'll have to stretch it a bit to get it 
under the clips, and you'll have to poke holes in it to get the  clip 
bolts through.  Again, pretty obvious when you do it.  

11. Voila.  New top!

Subject: 51 temperature, exp tank overflow?

A quick question or two.

On my 86 951 I replaced the temp switch in the radiator last fall
(tipical falure leaving fans on and battery dies).  This summer the car
has been running very hot in stop and go trafic when the AC is not on. 
I checked the fans by shorting the connector and both speeds still work.
This indicates to me I got a bad sensor/switch anyone else ever have this
problem??  Alternate diagnosis?

Also yesterday when I parked in the garage the car peed on the floor.
First impression Oh no the water pump went.  But it was anti freze from
the exp tank (this was the reason I finally confirmed the fans work on
both speeds, I took off the underbody pans to check).  My question here
is that this has never happened before, is it symptomatic of something
else?  Air in the cooling system?  Or is it a random occurance and not
likely to happen again for another 8 yrs.

On buying stuff to make your car go fast.  I believe this is something
everyone goes through in almost every sport.  I got my lesson in bicycle
racing, I thought that if only I had a better bicycle I'd do well in
races.  After saving for a full campy (same co that makes Ferrari
wheels) bike and doing no better I realized I had better work on myself
more than the equipment.  After seeing one of the class winners in a
local Auto-X set a faster time in the rent-a-racer run off mustang than
most people set in their Porsche's I realized the same thing was in
effect in car racing.  Bottom line get the experience first, learn to
drive a stock car fast, schools, track time etc.  Then buy the go-fast
tweaks.  Not that this advice ever seems to be listened to everyone
needs to learn on their own (see random changing of tire compounds and
sizes).  Maybe someday I'll give up bicycle racing and Speedskating and
learn to race cars.  On the other hand how many of you can say you've
raced at Lime Rock on a Sunday (Bicycles are real quiet, and we have to
know apexes too;-)

I was watching a movie last night called Fearless.  In the movie the subject

be in a wreck.  Have there ever been any crash tests performed on a 911?
Probably not many due to the cost.  Has anyone had firsthand experience

Subject: Just a quick story...


I just had to relate the following...

I was walking down the street and stopped for a light at the Highway 1
intersection.  Up pulls a Ferrari F40 with a obviously refined, elderly
and well to do couple inside.  They must have been on their way to the
Historics at Laguna Seca this weekend or perhaps to the Concours at
Pebblebeach. 

Lo and behold, a local "poser" pulls up in his 930 turbo and does his 
best to instigate a little drag race by revving the hell out of his 
Porsche and grimmacing at the older couple.  I saw the lady passenger 
nervously smile and then turn her head towards her driving husband.

I chuckled internally.  Few folks would drag race an F40 (a 930 too for
that matter) considering how much each car might cost to repair.  When the
light turned green, I was awestruck as to how hard the gentleman launched
that big-buck F40.  The tire smoke and exhaust note was simply awesome ! 

Nice to know that some folks actually use their house-priced cars for 
some fun, although illegal action.   The poser ?  He appeared to be 3-4 
car lengths back after a few hundred feet off the line.  He must have 
been caught napping...NOT.   M.

Denny,

Thanks for the pointer to Haggerty. I talked to them today, and alas, while
they do insure in California, their annual mileage max is only 2,500! I drive
lots more miles than that (I could never walk past my beauty in the garage day
after day without driving her!), so they will not work out for me.

Also, I checked this restriction with Leland West (brokers for Great American
Insurance thru PCA) and their annual max is 5000 miles. They inspect the
odometer once a year, and at 5000.01, you are dropped like a hot potato!

So...unless someone else out there comes up with a good altrernative, it looks
like the only one left with really good rates and no heavy duty mileage
restrictions is 20th Csntury, but I need to double check with them re. mileage.

And he's right.  Why?  Look, I'm not stupid, it is offensive enough (in a

the engine running.  I called Akiko, had her watch my car, drove home, 
looked for a half hour for my spare key, couldn't find it.

Went back to the gas station, called a locksmith, waited 45 minutes.  
Watched him put "wedgies" in between the glass and door of the passenger 
side, pretty careful here, but I can't tell if him dangling things down 
there did any damage.  Door window seems to be a little rougher now on 
that side though.  No outer visible damange.  Anways he is getting no 
where.  Anoterh locksmith van comes by and yells "try picking it ABC" as 
ABC is the name of the locksmith working on my car, and is on big letter 
s on his van.

He then pulls out his lock picks and starts going at it on both doors 
trying to pick the lock, with his high tech stuff, including a fiber 
optic flashlight I forgot to mention.

Finally he does what I would have done first if I had the tools, the 
windows are open a couple inches.  He pulls some hangers bent up out of 
his van and starts fishin' for the window crank, I immediately stop him, 
and say "hey" "be careful with that there, it's sharp" He then goes and 
gets a rubber coated modified fishing pole/hanger and keeps fishin' for 
the door handle.  Eventually he gets it, and the window is open 2.75" or 
so, and Akiko squeezes her arm down and unlocks it.

Turns out the guy put a nice spider web on my windshield with his fishing 
pole tool, but says he'll pay the bill.  Anyone know if I need special 
glass for this?  Should I go to the dealer?  How much will it cost?  Will 
I end up having to take this guy to small claims court or will he likely 
pay up?  Thanks.

I noticed Stan replied to a question about bleeding brakes and noted that he
was going to try the Eazy-Bleeder things. I have used this tool and found it
far superior to both the old pumping method and the mity vac, mostly because
the Eazy-Bleeder keeps the pressure constant throughout the whole bleeding
process (it uses a cap to screw on the master cylinder (which has a hose
running to a bottle). You then attach the other hose to your tire valve (it
has a fitting so you can just snap it right on the valve). Once you do that,
you just walk around the car and crack bleed screws one by one. Very cool.
Since the bleeder uses tire pressure (30ish psi), there is a good amount of
pressure going through the system to get any air bubbles out, etc.

Just my two cents worth !!!

Subject: Re: older 911 maintanence tips

Thank you Mike and Steve for your help with my "new" 911. I've already
changed the oil and plan on doing more to make sure that everything is in top
shape. But for now the top three things on my  list are the following:

1. I'm going to change the brake fluid soon. Is it better to use a brake
bleeding tool or is it okay to just pump the pedals until the system is
clear?

2. I really want to change the transmission fluid.  I've read on the list
that Swepco transmission fluid is the best. Since my transmission isn't in
the best condition, I thought that I would put Swepco trans. fluid to get the
most out of the gearbox before the inevitable rebuild. Where can I get it in
Florida, specifically Miami? Is there an 800 number that I can call to find
out? Also, Mike  says

>Don't overfill, let it run out until it stops when you reach the fill hole.

How much oil is that so I know how much to buy.

3. Getting an alarm. A must in South Florida if you want to keep your car for
long time.

As for my car it already has the Carrera chain tensioners and the previous
owners scrapped the MFI and put Webers in. There is also a rather loud Bursch
muffler. It's too bad that I never drove the car with its' original muffler.
It would have been interesting to see the difference in performance between a
stock and a "hi-performance" muffler. Lastly, my car is a color blind's
nightmare: I have green Bilsteins in the front and red Konis in the back
which really worries me because our resident handling expert says the KYB
shocks are the best ;-) .

One last question. Which spark plugs should I use on a 2.4L S engine with
Webers. I haven't checked what kind I currently have, is their a big
difference between the Bosch Platinums and other plugs?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Ah, so I can go to a 1 battery setup (good!), why did Porsche go to a 2 battery 
setup for 69(?)-73 years? 

Can you give some details about this battery? (maybe it's not available here

I think there might be a few possibilities, but research has to be done.

First one might find a suitable piston amongst other manufacturers, designed 
to other cars, but with possibility to fit an oversize cylinder. Offset 
might be a problem.

Second one might be able to rework a VW P/C set to fit the 356 engine. I 
haven't looked at the details here at all, but cylinders free lenght, bore 
in case, fit in head are some interesting aspects, also the bolt pattern. 

Third you'd might buy 500 oversize pistons(or whatever minimum quanta they 
will take)  from a company like Gemini SRL in Italy.

Seriously, I would like to know what brand of tires you recommend for 
me.  I have a '77 911 slightly lowered with 16" wheels 6" wide in front, 
7" in rear, factory option Fuchs on the '78 SC.

Currently I have 205x50x16" Dunlop D40M2 Z tires on front, and 195x50 
Yokohama Intermediates on the rear.  The tread on the rears are almost 
gone after 5K miles.

I'd like to keep the same tires for street and auto-x.  I'm not real 
happy with the Dunlops, and am wondering if their tread rating of 180 is 
too high for my driving?

What do you recommend in the Goodyear line for my driving?  Do you 
recommend I go with 15" wheels as I cannot go wider than 205 with my 
current suspension and body style.

Thanks.  I have to admit that where your tires are made, scare the 
bejeebas out of me.  While our great country manufactures the highest 
quality tanks, guns, missles, toxic waste, and nuclear fuel rods, I 
didn't think we made the best rubber tires.  Am I wrong?

A small piece of 2x4 can sometimes be handy as it is 'nice' on the

before you use it, it will be very 'soft' but still won't brake apart.

Always when working under a part of the car that would be 'to low for

Subject: Re[2]: 911 Bump Steer


     

To cure bump steer on a lowered car, you can also raise the front spindles on 
the strut housing about 19mm.  This is an alternative to using rack spacers, but
the rack spacer is much easier.

If you want to raise your spindles (I know this works on Bilstein struts)

You need:

a) a drill press
b) a powerful die grinder with a carbide grinding bit
c) a MIG welder (must be 220V to handle the task)

You need to remove the strut housing and then remove the cartridge from the 
strut housing.  Notice that the spindle is welded to the strut housing through a
hole in the spindle assembly.  This weld is drilled out using the drill press.  
Its Ok to drill right throught the strut housing.  The remaining edges of the 
weld are removed using the die grinder.  Once the weld is removed, the spindle 
is moved up by about 19mm (the max if you run 16" wheels, less if you run 15's 
since the bottom of the strut housing will hit the inside of your wheels after 
raising the spindles) and then welded *generously* to the strut housing again 
with the 220V MIG.  The hole you drilled will be visible just beyond the base of
the spindle.  This hole is patched by welding a patch made from a piece of pipe 
cut into a little triangle large enough to cover the hole.  The whole assembly 
is finally cleaned and re-painted on the outside.

______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________
     
Yep, you've hit the point where your steering rack is below the plain of 
the tie rods.  The geometry of the steering system now lets the upward 
movement of the suspension exert more force on the rack which is fed back 
into the steering wheel.
     
AutoMotion (800) 777-8881 makes two nifty fixes.
     
Part number RS-050 ($12.95) is a pair of spacers that will raise the
steering rack back up to where it should be, without changing the ride height.
     
Part number TK-930 ($209.95) is an improved Tie Rod, complete with ends 
that are similar to the tie rods used on the turbo cars. These tie rods 
will not, in and of themselves, cure the bump steer but they will make the 
steering "feel" much better and more positive.
     
I'd install the rack spacers first then if you're still not happy, go for 
the tie rods.
     
BTW, lowering the car *has* changed the cars alignment
     
Hope this helps

Also, "Miami Vice" episodes were replete with Porsche offerings.

"Cannonball Run" had Porsche 911 - the two woman team drove it.

"Patriot Games" - Jack Ryan's wife drives a 911 which gets shot up and

To the list,
My '86 951 shift linkage makes a solid clanking noise when
I shift to 2nd or reverse.  The sound it makes is similar to the sound of a
heavy spoon  striking the bottom of a cooking pot.
Makes no difference if the car is running or not. The more forceful the shift
the louder the noise.  I'm not sure if it has always done it or
 if I have just started noticing it since summer. (windows down).  Any

If you're thinking that you'll have to change tires, you don't need 
any of this stuff.  Here are some suggestions:

1. Autocross on your stock street tires until they wear out.
   You learn an amazing amount about car handling on hard-compound
   tires.

2. When the stock tires wear out, buy some high-end street tires
   such as top-of-the line Bridgestones, Pirellis, or Yokohamas.
   These will allow you to be competitive at autocrossing, won't
   wear out immediately, and will allow you to drive to work in the 
   rain.

3. Then, if you really like autocrossing, buy R-compound tires, 
   which you use only for racing.  These will provide increased 
   performance with the following side effects:

	- They handle poorly in the rain.
	- You have to have space to store them.
	- In most PCA regions, they bump you up to a different
          class, which requires more modifications to stay
          competitive.


If you're just starting to autocross, you don't need anything except
enthusiasm, a reliable car, and patience.

I think this is really the 928, right? Maybe mine will start to
appreciate, since they are becoming rarer by the day...

Fifteen years life for the basic design isn't too bad. The air-cooled
crowd will point to the 30+ years of the 911, but are there really
any interchangeable parts between the two ends of that lifetime? The
character of the 911 has radically changed, while the 928 was just
refined over the years.

Cylinders to use with Shasta pistons -- you find some used but not yet bored

Subject: Is this a sway bar???

Please forgive my ignorance but I have a question.  When I purchased my '84
911 carrera they guy I got it from told me had removed the rear sway bar.

Well I finally got around to reinstalling it and I'm not sure what the heck
this thing is.  Both the front and rear sway bars are on the car (the ones
where the ends slide into rubber grommets). 

This bar I have does look like a sway bar (two rubber grommets about 6 inches
in from the ends and has a piece bolted on each each with an eyelet on it,
which appears to be about 1/2" in diameter).

I was looking around underneath the car and it appears it mounts in front
of the rear wheels, I see where the rubber grommets would have caps to hold
them in place.  What I can't figure out is where the end pieces with the
eylets on them would bolt up.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Hi, Eric.
 
944s do whine a bit. While working in Germany, walking in parking lots, I
could always tell when a 944 was rolling up behind from the whine. We had a
similar noise on an engine I was developing while at Porsche, for an
outside client. It also had a belt-driven cam. We measured the frequency of
the whine, and it turned out that it was related to the number of teeth on
the cam sprocket -- it was just air being squished out as each rubber tooth
on the belt made contact.

Bingo! You can fix this with a sealant (pst or similar) on the bleeder
screws, but you need to know that when you're putting in *NEW* calipers
or have the old ones apart for rebuild. There's *no way* to not contaminate
the brake fluid otherwise....

> Any other comments about using this type of bleeder are appreciated.

Well, that's why I went to a high-volume pump. I set up a siphon into the
reservoir to keep brake fluid coming, and just pump the fool out of the
system. Flowing 2-3x more fluid through the calipers than strictly necessary,
it always works. At the expense of the extra fluid, and an electric pump.
Which is one of the reasons I'm looking forward to checking out the
Eezi-bleed next week.

Subject:  Selling 944 to a non-Porschephile

Well, gentle readers, the votes are in in response to my query about the
philosophical acceptability of selling my reasonably-beloved '83 944 to an
unhinged non-'phile who may or may not take care of the car.

Somewhat to my surprise, the vote was lopsided: the operative words were,
"Take the money and run."  The voting ran as follows:

     Sell it-----------16 votes (all male)
     Keep it------------2 (both female, as I recall)
     Your choice--------2 (male)
     Unable to inter-
       pret comment-----1 (male)

I have learned a few things from this (my original intent, of course).
First, P'philes are much less sentimental about or attached to specific cars
than I might have expected.  The tone of most responses (see below) was
pragmatic, hey, it's just a CAR, fer cryin' out loud, you can make a profit
and upgrade.  Second, the dangers of being stalked by the buyer myself
worried some (and me).  Third, I believe the only two to advise keeping the
car were women; does this mean female P'philes are more attached to their
cars than the males?  [Don't flame me on sample size, all you statisticians.]
Fourth, this is a witty and fun group of people [one writer thanked me for
introducing two new terms-- "warped icon," and "auto-erotic;"  I can't take
credit for the second one, it's been around for ages].  Thanks for the fun
and the input.

Oh, I suppose you want to know what I'm going to do.  The car is in the shop
today for various problems, and the outcome of the inspections may determine
what I do!  However, at the moment I am leaning to selling it to her, for
these reasons: 1. Making a 33% profit is pleasant; 2. Having enjoyed the car
for a year, I can see the advantages of the newer models; 3. It may get her
off my back; 4. I kind of enjoyed shopping for the current car, and look
forward to the next search.

Hunter

Addendum: a resume of comments received

1. "you seem a bit obsessed with the car [I thought P'philes were supposed to
be?]... [It's] not a Bugatti... a garden variety automobile... simple
decision...." 

2. TAKE THE CASH!

3. "This obsessive woman sounds like bad news... I vote keep the car....  Why
encourage her craziness?"

4. Take the money.

5. No contest, sell the car and roll your profits over into an even nicer
car.

6. Take the money.  Use it to buy a newer Porsche, may be a 951.

7. You should sell this car ASAP [many good reasons listed].  Do you want her
stalking your car?...  If I could make a 33% profit in two months, I would
sell ANYTHING I own....  Make...sure this is a cash deal....

8. ...let it go and move on to a 911.  [advice then given to look first for
the kilo of cocaine that I worried might be on board]

9. If she is that wacko let her have it.

10. Do the right thing [but didn't say what that is].  Stalking is not user
friendly.

11. Sell the car!  It is not your emotional icon....

12. I'd say keep the car.... You may never find another one you're so happy
with....

13. SELL! [repeated 6 times]

14. SELL!!! [repeated 3 times]  (am I clear on this?)

15. [lengthy warning about dangers of stalkers]  It's just a f-----g car--
don't get killed over it!

16. Do what YOU want.  We often do worse trying to second guess the world....
It's not like giving a gun to a psychotic [I'm not sure, that's why I asked
the question, folks]

17. Take the money and run.

18. ...sell it and get a newer model.

19. I'd argue that there were so many 944s made that dumping [it]

This is hard to do on my 924S. The drivers door lock can only be locked
from outside with the key. You can't push the button down and close it like
on most american/japenese cars.  This feature is only on the drivers side
door.

So, on my car, you'd have to get out, lock the drivers door. Go to the

Not being critical. Just curious. Are the doors different on some models/years?

been one of the most inexpensive-to-operate Porsches I've owned.  But, the
miles are over 130K now and it's time to bench it, and begin to bring back
some of its mechanicals.  I can do anything with a 914, but am still a "babe"
with 911's, so some of you may need to hold my hand occasionally; plan on
this project taking 6-12 months before "Bluto" hits the road again.  This
whole thing was begun today when I noticed the smell of hot brake pads while
simply driving to the gas station, so I'll begin with brakes.

My logic tells me that the calipers need either rebuilding or
replacement(they are the originals).  I'll ask for those of you who have had
experience with rebuild kits for your opinions please, since there is about
$600 difference in price.  Also, noticed a slight pulling to the right on
braking.  Car had been sitting for about 3 weeks - any ideas? Master
cylinder? Caused by first noted problem? By the way, the fluid is fresh this
year.

Please help guys - I refuse to be beaten and give in to a pro for anything

should buy a new assembly, the problem being that the self
adjuster mechanism will be ruined.

Question: Are these calipers serviceable? I understand the

The windshield has a huge crack in it, it is broken, not falling apart, 
but the crach is about 6" wide and going in all directions.

Tweeks has replacement windshields for $300 and $400 (heated?? tinted??) 
whiel Stoddard's costs about $600, anyone know the difference, or good

Hey,

The previous owner of my car was kind enough to give me the
European H-4 headlights that he took off the car when bringing
it to the US.  I'm in the process of doing some minor refurbishments
(they're showing every bit of their 18 years) and fully intend to put
them back on the car.  What is the legality of these things?  I think
they have a 40/55W bulb in them (FWIW).  Actually I'm not real worried about
the legality issue.  Living in Alabama, the authorities will be delighted
that I have two working headlights as that is somewhat of a rarity here:>).

The owner also gave me a pristine 250kph speedo that came out of the car -
may put it back in also.

In a Pano or Excellence a while back, there was an ad that featured a
c2/c4 targa that looked like it had been rolled. Bad.  From my experience
(6 years as a fireman) I wouldn't have though it was survivable, as
I recall.

I recall seing a sales brochure with a C2 or C4 just after it ate the
wall at Weissach(?) where they do the mandatory crash testing for DOT
standards and whoever elses standards (European)

I distinctly remeber the choked up feeling I felt whilst I was looking at
the remains.

Also, and an anectdote, I remember reading about early crash testing, where
they would have the test car ride the bumper of a mule car down a calibrated
test gradient, and when they got to a certain speed, the mule care would
pull out of the way and let the test car hit a wall at the bottom of the
grade.  I think it was the same book that described crash-testing the 904
by dropping it from a crane.   (Sob!)

My initial cut at this may be seen by some as either cheating or lazy, but I did
a full-text search of Cinemania '94 for "porsche" and produced the following
hits (the notes in square brackets are my own unreliable recollections, those
without are from the reviews on the CD-ROM):

Top Gun (1986): [Tom Cruise (on a fast Kawasaki) chases Kelly McGillis (in a
Speedster (replica)?) around San Diego]

Manhattan (1971): [Isaac (Woody Allen) has a friend Yale who buys a 356]

Middle Age Crazy (1980): Title tells all: 40-year-old Dern buys a Porsche [928],
some new threads, and leaves wife Ann-Margret for pro-football cheerleader
Wakeham. Nothing new; inspired by the hit song. [This is a must-see for 928
aficianados!]

The Last Chase (1981): Oil shortage causes the demise of auto travel during the
1980s; 20 years later, ex-race-car driver Lee Majors reassembles his Porsche and
becomes a "symbol of freedom" as he races across the country. Flimsy drama that
reeks of Reaganomics.
 
The Dream Machine (1990): Super-wealthy Slate is murdered by an embezzler after
cheating on his wife. She's just learned of his infidelity and, on an impulse,
gives his new turbo-charged Porsche to immature college student Haim (who
doesn't know the deceased's body is stuffed in the trunk). By-the-numbers
action-thriller with an intriguing (if unlikely) premise.

Risky Business (1983): Piquant, original comedy about a reticent teenager who
goes a bit wild while his parents are out of town, and becomes involved--in more
ways than one-- with a prostitute. Brickman's darkly satiric script is balanced
by Cruise's utterly likable (and believable) performance in the lead.  [Tom
Cruise sinks his father's 928 in Lake Michigan]

Beatmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time (1991): Hero Dar returns (belatedly) to
battle another evil wizard Hauser -- this time, thanks to magician Douglas, in
the streets of modern-day L.A. Some cleverness, but cheaply made and contrived.
Nine writers are credited.  [time travel in a Porsche, later an object of
worship]

Flashdance (1983): Jennifer Beals plays Alex, an eighteen-year-old who is a
welder by day, and a go-go dancer by night, and dreams of being a ballet star,
and falls in love with the Porsche-driving boss of the construction company.

Shakedown (1988): Entertaining actioner with public defender Weller and
undercover cop Elliott combining forces to rid N.Y.C. of drugs and corruption.
Good of its kind, with oodles of sensational stuntwork to compensate for the
dearth of originality.  For example, imagine this. A private jet airplane is
taking off from LaGuardia. A public defender and a tough plainclothesman are
chasing it down the runway in a Porsche. At the last moment, the cop leaps from
the car and grabs one of the wheels of the plane. As the plane gains altitude,
he shoots a bullet through an engine, forcing the pilot to turn back. Then, as
the plane approaches the runway for an emergency landing, he slips a hand
grenade into the wheel well and falls into the water below. The grenade
explodes, making it look like the plane crashed, while the cop swims to safety
and is hauled ashore by his buddy, the defender.


No Man's Land (1987): The lieutenant wants the new patrolman to do undercover
work for a couple of reasons: The kid knows all about Porsches, and he's so new
on the force that he doesn't act like a cop. There are two things the lieutenant
doesn't take into account: The kid really loves Porsches, and he doesn't think
like a cop. By the end of No Man's Land, those two items have gotten everybody
into a lot of trouble.
The young cop, played by D.B. Sweeney, is a fresh-faced rookie who spends all of
his free time rebuilding old cars. The lieutenant wants him to infiltrate a
Porsche dealership run by a rich kid (Charlie Sheen). The dealership seems to be
a front for a car-theft and chop-shop operation, and the previous cop who
infiltrated it has been murdered. The lieutenant is convinced that Sheen pulled
the trigger.

Sweeney gets the job after he passes a couple of tests; he proves he knows all
about repairing Porsches, and during a fast trip down the hairpin turns in the
hills above Los Angeles, he proves to Sheen that he can drive one, too....

K-2 (1992): A molehill has been made of a mountain. Meyers's stunning play about
two characters in search of survival on K2, the world's second highest peak,
fails to scale any cinematic heights at all.  The original theatrical piece,
mounted on Broadway in 1983, has been effectively enlarged and the two
mountain-climbing protagonists given fleshed-out identities. Bachelor Taylor
Brooks (Michael Biehn), owner of a silver metallic Porsche convertible, is a
wiseguy and womanizing assistant DA, whose idea of a good time is picking up
gals who are "wet, wild, and willing."...

In the Soup (1992): A semi-autobiographical black comedy from writer-director
Alexandre Rockwell, In the Soup is a wry and biting yarn, highlighted by a cast
of quirky characters and an outlandish and twisting plot line....On Christmas
morning, Cassel tells him it's time they raised money for their film. He coerces
Buscemi to join him as he steals a new Porsche from a cop's driveway.

  On the '77 911, the passenger door just locks and closing it doesn't

Subject: Re: Trials and tribulations trying to buy a 911

Phillip,
	I can sympathize with your search.  I spent 2
months actively looking before I found my 911 (the one
I bought, that is).  I had three pre-purchase inspections
done on 911s, at $75.00 a pop.  I spent at least one night
a week and all day Saturday looking at cars, and cruised
both local newspapers daily, looking for new advertisements
for used 911s.

	The first car I had inspected was owned by a friend
known to be fussy about his Porsches.  It was the right
color (love that ice green metallic), the right price,
etc, etc.  The list of things wrong was a page and a half
long, and most of it was very unpleasant news to my friend.
Being fussy about his Porsches, he fixed most of the items
on the list, and sold it for $1500 higher than what he
and I discussed.  I didn't really want a 2.7L anyway...

	The second car I was sure was a keeper.  A white
over cork '78 SC, with all the normally bright accents in
black.  Gorgeous car.  Low miles according to documentation
(sparse) and title.  Price was right.  Yes sir, that baby
was MINE.  Not.  It had been hit very hard in the front
end, and very poorly repaired, with huge weld beads under
the front pan.  The engine was run out, with the best
cylinder something like 8% compression loss.  My mechanic
thought that this was the first 3.0L SC engine that failed
a leakdown test in his shop.  Turned out that there was
55K miles on a replacement speedometer, but the engine
had seen something like 250K miles.  The seller was
rightly furious, and went off to sue somebody into
oblivion.  I believe mileage fraud is a federal offense,
so somebody may be in serious trouble.

	I learned how to examine bodywork for evidence of
poor repairs, so my $75 was totally wasted.  Actually, it
was very well spent, because otherwise I would have bought
an unrepairable lemon...

	The moral:  take your time.  Do it right.  Have a
mechanic *you* trust do a complete, thorough pre-purchase
inspection, and *listen* to him.  He can save you a lot of
money in car repairs.

Subject: Re: Early 911 woes

Pat,
Sounds like your problem is bad brakes lines, the rubber ones.  They swell
over time and can form a one way valve not allowing the caliper to fully
release!  Happened on my '71T with the same results. Replace them first.  I'd
use braided stainless lines in the -3 size, but new rubber ones are ok.

If it is not lines, your calipers may be sticky. Disconnect your brake lines
from the calipers (to eliminate the problem above), and try to push in the
pistons.  If they don't easily move, use a c clamp.  Hook your brake lines
back up, bleed the calipers, and excersize the calipers a few times, using
the thinnest pads you have to let the piston come out as far as possible.
 Then push the piston back, and do it again.  If they don't free up, you've
got other problems, and it is time to rebuild the calipers.

Everyone sells rebuild kits. All you generaly need is the seals, and they
should run about $10 -20 each for the kits.  Follow the Haynes manual to
force out the pistons one at a time.  Check the pistons for corrosion.  If
they are pitted, replace them with stainless ones from Stoddard.  Clean out
the bore of the caliper, and install the new seals.   Use emory cloth or 600
or higher wet/dry sandpaper to clean out the bore if brake cleaner won't do
it.  Don't worry if the bore is pitted, as long as the bore doesn't have
ridges.  The seal rides on the piston, so the condition of the bore as long
as the seal area is intact is pretty much inmaterial. DO NOT split the
caliper halves!!!  You'll need new bolts and nuts if you do, and the new
seals that go between the halves.  Thouroughly clean out the calipers with
brake cleaner, then blow out with lots and lots of air to romve all traces of
the brake cleaner before putting in the new seals, etc.

Now, when all of this is done, flush the entire system with fresh fluid. Let
it run out of the lines before you hook up your rebuilt calipers to make sure
that all of the old crud is out of the lines.  Completely empty to reservoir
first with a turkey baster first (Jan will love it!), and wipe out any crud
remaining.  If you are going to strictly use the car on the street, use
Castrol fluid.  If you plan to use the car on the track (come on Pat, you
have to try it sometime!), use a high temp DOT 3 fluid, such as Ford Heavy
Duty in the blue can, and change it no more than 48 hrs before each event,
using at least two cans to flush the system.  If you only use the car on the
street, flush your fluid AT LEAST once per year.

Hope this helps.

I think what you're looking at are the shackles that permit the attachment
of the ends ot the swaybar to the banana arms. A little nylon insert goes
in the small end of the shackle and fits over the ball stud on the banana
arm (although this may be primarily relevant to the older cars).  I think
the newer cars - SCs & up - switched over to a different type of shackle
but the theory was the same.....

Rather than checking the rest of the circuit, check the impedence(s) of

caliper is never released).  Perhaps this is your problem.

Perhaps this is why you need to set yours to 101 to get 94.  I suspect that
storing it "set" causes the spring in the head to sack.  If you're going to
store it set, you should probably recheck its actual torque periodically,
because the setting may continue to weaken with time.

>>>the beam type (being that steel has the same stiffness no matter how it's
abused) can be used as a calibrator, once it's determined accurate.

How did you determine that your beam-type wrench is accurate?

Subject: Re: Early 911 woes

Pat,

Jon Lowe's answer to you brake question is very good.  I would add
and emend a few things.

If you are wearing or heating up one corner's pads, and the car
is pulling, it's a pretty good sign of a brake problem there.  A
lot more brake dust on that wheel is also a sign.

I have a major problem with "stainless steel" hoses and folks who
recommend them for street cars.  Most folks do an unacceptable job
of installing them, and almost no one maintains them (ie, checks that
they are OK, replacing periodically).  When I say "most", I mean
quite literally "the great majority", and I include some jobs done by
professional mechanics.

Even when installed properly, their lifetimes are significantly
shorter than OE rubber hoses.  They ought to be replaced every year
or two.  Because of their design -- s/s braid over teflon -- you
cannot see failures which have occurred or are on the way to
occurring.  Swelling or failure of the teflon hose near one of the
fittings, or crimping or other damage to the length of the hose.

The idea that s/s hoses offer an advantage over OE rubber hoses is,
as best I can tell, a myth.  The claim that they yield a firmer
pedal has yet to be proven to me.  I ran s/s hoses in my own car
for a few years.  I noticed no difference when they went on, nor
when I went back to rubber.  This at the track and on the street.
We run Porsche rubber hoses on our 911 race car, picking lengths
from inventory to suit the configuration.  For example, I believe
the rear hoses are 928 parts.

I know Jon meant well in his recommendation, and please don't take
this to be a flame.  It isn't.  I have seen too many s/s hoses fail.
Fortunately, I have not seen anyone hurt as a result.  Knock wood!

On to other subjects.  I clean up brake pistons with parts cleaner
and a mild "scotch bright" scrubbing pad.  Not the coarse green ones
you find in the supermarket, but a finer one we mooch from the body
shop next door.  It does a nice job of taking built-up debris off
the pistons without removing any metal.  I use a metal "toothbrush"
on the calliper itself, except for the bores.

I wouldn't force the pistons with a C clamp.  If you cannot move
them by hand or with the help of a wooden paint brush handle, it's
time.

The seal kits are inexpensive and available from Porsche or in the
aftermarket.  Be careful to ask what it is you are getting and what
it will cost.  For the 930 and 944 Turbo's Brembo brakes, they only
make the rebuild kits available with replacement pistons.  You're
looking at $40 to $60 per kit, four kits to a calliper, for these
cars.

If you don't have compressed air to blow all the solvent out of
the callipers after cleaning, flush them instead with rubbing alcohol.

If the bleeder valves are chewed up, now is a good time to replace
them.  Available from Porsche, as are the rubber dust caps.  Replace
any hardware which looks questionable.  Bolts and washers are cheap.

As with any rubber seal, you should lubricate the piston seals before
re-inserting the pistons.  Porsche sells a Unisilicon paste specifically
for this application, smells like Mink Oil.  If you don't want to
cough up for it, just wet the seals with fresh brake fluid.  Lubricate
the bleeder valve threads with the paste or fluid as well.

When you install the brake hoses, do so in a way which avoids any
preload on them, ie, any twisting force left in the hose after its
fittings are all tightened down.  (This is why some cars use banjo
fittings and hollow union bolts at the calliper, btw.)

Lubricate the sliding edges of the pads with anti-seize, keeping it
off the pad material.  If you have floating callipers, lubricate
the sliding surfaces between them.  Ditto for the locking pins and
cross-spring, if your callipers have them.

Oh yes, and before you start, hold the brake pedal a little ways
down, perhaps wedging a length of 2x4 between it and the seat.  By
moving the pedal down, and so the MC piston in a bit, you seal it
from the reservoir.  Capillary action in the lines and hoses will
keep fluid from draining out of the lines, and you will end up
with a lot less air in the system.

Wrong.  If it's "really" anything, it's a 944.

You started out talking about the basic design, and move immediately to
interchangeable parts.  What's the number of interchangeable parts got to do
with the basic design?  BTW, I own a 4-valve 928, and I sure wouldn't want to
interchange its engine with any of the earlier 928 engines!  Nor would I want to
interchange any of the brake parts with the older ones. 

>>>The character of the 911 has radically changed, while the 928 was just

Has the character of the 911 really *radically* changed?  Was the change in its
character over the *first 15 years* ('65-'80) any more radical than that of the
928 from '77-'92?  In any case, many of the "air-cooled crowd" would argue that
the character of the 928 wasn't worth preserving in the first place!

Also, if I accept that the the 911's character has radically changed, I suspect
that lack of such "radical change" in the 928's character is because it never
sold very well, and therefore wasn't worth investing that much development money
in.  Or maybe it's because Porsche felt they got it pretty much right the first
time around.  I suspect the former, but who knows?

I am still in contact with the original owner of the slate grey/red 64 C

on the car, he had it line bored, had over sized bearing(.020) put in,had the
crank ground and put in a 912 cam. In addition,he had the rebuilder put in
NPR big bore kit and completely rebuilt the heads.( He also had the tops of
the cylinder shaved 35 degree what ever that means.
 I have been getting  advice that the NPR kit is of poor quality and doesn't
have a long lifeand that I will have to think about replacing them with Mahle
in the near  future.
The car has had a paint job in 74 and has been in the owner's garage for
eight years stored. He had a stroke and can't drive.
He's so attached to his car that an offer of $15,000 nearly game him another
stroke. He wants $18,000. From Our discussions and others from Ca.Porsche
people, I was under the impression that $15 was the fair and going rate. Am I
mistaken?
I do want an original or veay nice restored one which was rust and accident

Some think they went to 2 batteries to make the car less tail happy. They

Gates battery is made by a huge automotive supply company in the USA. It has
(I think) 6 cylinder shaped cells which have the acid in a felt-like material
which will hold the acid even if the battery is broken open. It also can be
mounted in any position, even upside down and will not leak. It is not a GEL
CELL like other leakproof batteries. Someone is making Gel CELLS now for the

Well, I lived to write about it.  First, we had deluges of rain early 
(pre-dawn) and during tech time, so the original course was wiped out 
(puddles doing their best lake imitations).  On the new, significantly 
shortened course, I started out horrendously.  Tried to do too much 
shifting between 1st and 2d.  However, by the 5th run I was down to 31.37 
secs.  Best in class was 27.84 (a veteran autox'er) and second was 30.56 
(I think).  FTD was 27.36.
  
Overall I was fairly pleased.  I improved a lot over the 5 runs (4.35

rubber (D-40's) and stock set up all the way.  I have a lot to learn, but

Hi, Steve.
 
Porsche, like any other car manufacturer, does lots of crash testing. They
started out years ago dropping cars nose-first from a crane (see R&T, Feb
88, p. 40; yes, that's a real 904 they're going to drop). Then came a steep
hill in Weissach with a barrier at the bottom. Next, a sled inside the
basement of the main building at Weissach, for testing various interior bits
(mockup of a car shell, wire mesh for windows, instrumented dummies, nothing
outside the interior plastic got bent). Most recently they have a high-tech
indoor crash building, featured in the commercial, for folding up cars.
 
Porsches tend to be very safe in crashes. The 911 uses fairly heavy steel
sections (was true of older generation, after all designed in 1963; I
presume it still holds for the new 993). Also, the fully galvanized
construction means rust won't weaken them after a few years.

Subject: Ted, the self-acknowledged idiot

Ooh, I love the story about Ted locking his keys in the running car.
 
Then he has to call his Akita or something to watch the car. What Ted M.
probably forgot to mention was that he had to call her on the cell phone, as
she was LOCKED INSIDE THE CAR!!!
 
Now the arrogant little prick wants to sue the locksmith who helped him get
the car open after his own stupidity. I know of a situation like that. The
locksmith looked at the ownerprick, took the keys out of his hand, tossed
them back in the car, locked the door, and drove away in his van.
 
Come on, Stan, it's time to confess. There really isn't any Ted M, right?
Nobody could be this stupid. He's just a fabrication to increase
P-Philes traffic. And somehow you got Scott Winders and the other people at
the last two slaloms to play along, claim that they saw him in person.
 
No real person could possibly be this stupid. This latest incident almost
proves that Ted is a fake character, because this key incident is straight
from several old shaggy dog stories. There is an ethnic joke told in various
countries with various ethnicities. I first heard it in Germany as an East
Frisian joke (the East Frisians are a chain of mostly useless islands in the
North Sea, between Germany and Holland, belong to Germany but nobody
knows why). An East Frisian accidentally locked his keys in the car. It
took him nearly an hour to free his trapped wife and kids.
 
And another one. This is an Opel Manta joke. In Germany, they tell Max Manta
stories. (They don't have Pontiac Trans Ams with flaming chickens on the
hood, but second-generation Mantas have the same demographics). Max Manta is
at a gas station. Goes to attendant, says he locked keys in, and could he
borrow a coathanger? Attendant give him coathanger. Half an hour later, he
wonders what is going on, sends his apprentice to check it out. Apprentice
comes back, says "boss, you won't believe this." They both go back, and there
is Max Manta on his knees, fishing for the locking pin with the coathanger,
and telling his girlfriend inside the car "a little more to the left, no,
LEFT..."
 
The fact that this so-called Ted M. character admits publicly to all these
stupid adventures (curbsurfing, wrong tires on wrong end, three
different brands of tires on car, etc.) is further proof that he doesn't
exist. Again a Manta joke. Max Manta pulls up to a stoplight. A Golf
GTI pulls up alongside. The VW driver yells over: "Hey, what is
stupid and has four legs?" Max says "I dunno." "You and your
bimbo!" Light turns green, they drive off. At the next light, Max' pal
Juppi, with his lowered, all-white Baby Benz, pulls up alongside.
"Hey," calls Max. "What's stupid and has four legs?" "Dunno", says
Juppi. "Me and my bimbo!"
 
See, only fictional characters can be that stupid. Ergo, Ted does
not exist.

Subject: RE: Locking Steering

Mike,

I had the same problem with my '74. Unfortunately, it is often a sign of
a bad steering rack which is expensive to replace. The way to test for this
is to steer the car around a small, tight corner (parking lot kind of affair,
not a high-speed sweeper) and let go of the wheel at the end of the turn without
centering the wheel. If the wheel hesitates to center itself or doesn't center
at all, it's a pretty good bet the rack is gone. This is a *dangerous* problem
for obvious reasons. Fix it or get it fixed soon.

I have also heard of the steering column bearing going bad, but I don't know
what the true symptoms of that are. For me, replacing the rack worked. If you
replace the rack, put the turbo tie rods on at the same time. The improvement
is astonishing. I've never driven a car with better steering feel and response
than my '74 with the turbo tie rods. You'll be glad you did.

Best wishes for your '76,

Unfortunately for my budget, I have *both* an Italian and a German metal habit.

the very few production cars a stock 930 won't beat. Remember, in 1983, the
930 was tested to be the fastest accelerating production car in the world
(standing kilometer). Don't loose respect for the 930. It's not as far down
the supercar line from the F40 as you might think.

BTW, if you throw enough money at it, a 930 will take an F40 and any other
street legal car and whup up on it. Remember the Ruf-prepped 930s that dusted

Subject: Re: Uniden Beartracker source?

Kevin:

I have had a Uniden Beartraker in my 911 for several years and have done a
number of long multistate road trips with it.

The 'alarm' function works fine but...

In most states that have mobex secondary transmitters in the cars they are
not always on. The newer trooper cars automatically shut them off whenever
the trooper returns to the car and drives off - thus work only when Officer
Bob is out of the car and his belt radio is needed to retransmit to a
distant dispatcher. Also the troopers are aware of these scanners and often
shut even the older, nonauto secondary transmitters off while in the car.

One exception is CA where the transmitters are left on by regulation in
order to be always available in case of emergency - sound logic I think!

About 1/3 of the states don't have the units.

Steve,

One of the new Porsche commercials shows a beautiful 993 on the way to
being crashed into a concrete wall. It talks about how the building they do
the crash testing in has no windows and how that's good for the people who
build the car because they don't have to watch. They don't show the car hitting
the wall, which is good, as it would make me cry. It's one of several new
Porsche commercials which are quite good. They can be seen during ESPN's
Supercup coverage.

I do believe that governments require crash testing to some degree or another,
and have done so for some time. It's almost unthinkable, but I'm sure a few
911s have been sacrificed for our sakes. RIP. (You, too, Spike)

Porsche's build quality is second to none. Other than not having an engine
between you and the front end, I would think the car is pretty safe in an
accident. It's certainly safer than most econoboxes on the road. I don't want
to die in a Geo Metro!!!

Paul,

For the last year I used 205/50 R15 tires for racing my
924S without any clearance problems.  I would be carefull
though about the loss of height.  This will improve the
handling but will also make you much more likely to scrape
the front spoiler when going out a driveway etc.

As far as brands go, I have tried a number but found that the
AVS intermediates are by far the best bang for the buck.
Their performance is in the class with the best sport car
tires but their price is substantialy lower as you know.
Actualy I won the last time trial I was in running on AVSes
going up against guys with race tires.

Also the VR rating is fine for street and racing.

I guessed that he meant 928 when he wrote 968, since production of that
car too was recently reported to be down to three per day. Evidently a
bad guess. I do understand that a 968 <- 944 <- 924 isn't a 928.
Does this mean that the 928's will continue to dribble off the
production line, or that it too is about to be killed off?

Well...the weight hasn't changed all that much, nor the displacement, and
the basic feel of the car (another guess) is similar over the years. The

that much (not counting ABS, that is)?

They are certainly different - GT car vs. sports car is the comparison that

Subject: 914 rear brake caliper

Lins, I have rebuilt about 8 calipers from various cars, including the rear
914, all on account that they wouldn't retract.  Basically, I think that
the O-ring stiffened up, and it is the elasticity of these rings that
retracts the pistons (except in response to wear, in this case the pistons
slide past the O-rings). It's possible that dirt/water could get in and the
piston actually seize up, but, since the protective boots had not failed,
this didn't happen. I took a minimalist approach, and just replaced the
boots, circular clips, and O-rings (which come in a rebuild kit). I
polished up the pistons and cylinders with some emory paper. Normally these
really aren't in bad shape. I don't see any reason to disassemble the two
halfs of the caliper, this just opens a can of worms.
I don't remember any problem with the self adjusting mechanism. There may
be some special advice for the 914 rear calipers, which other Pfiles can
supply.

Interesting tidbit, Pete! BTW, when recently doing belts on my car (with the
generous assistance of another p-philer!) I noticed that there is an air
intake hose running from the timing cover. I had cynically concluded the idea
of this was to keep the timing case at a negative pressure relative to
atmosphere, to suck dust into the timing case. Perhaps it is to lower the air
pressure to reduce noise/windage??

Any thoughts out there on the purpose of this hose?

I have the same tool and the same problem.

What I do is ignore the bubbles until I have flushed enough
fluid, then close the bleeder screw.  I then just barely
crack the bleeder screw, assuming that I will get the
last bit of air out, then close the screw.  If I have
an assistant, I finish with the traditional "buddy system"
bleed, only one or two times per bleeder screw seems to 
be necessary.  Seems to work ok, even if the last step
is not done.

It seems that a better way is to force the brake fluid through
the system with pressure from the master cylinder side.  
Snap-on sells a hand pumped tool which supplies brake fluid
under pressure through the master cylinder with a screw-on
cap.  It's about $150.

What I did: 

I made a plastic washer with an OD equal to the size of the 
master cylinder cap and a hole in the center for a tire
valve.  I put a tire valve in the center and sealed it 
to the washer.

I temporarily remove the brake fluid level sensor 
from the cap, leaving the threaded part.  I put my plastic
washer on the master cylinder and screw down the cap.  I
then use a small hand pump to put 10psi of air in the 
master cylinder.  Open the bleeder screw on the brake
caliper and catch the fluid.  Works great but you must
mind the fluid level and the air pressure level carefully
so it is a bit more work than the Snap-on tool.  Cost is minimal though.

Snap-on does sell the master cylinder cap part of the tool
separately according to the catalog.  This could maybe be
adapted to work like my homemade rig but with more durability, since
it is one piece of aluminum (it appears from the picture).
Should be about $25.

the next quartermile or so, were bit and pieces of instrumentation, seats,
doors, Targa top and a big Chevy van with its front end pretty well smashed
in. Then the rear of a mid-70s Targa, relatively unscated from the rollbar
and lockposts back, no dents in rear quarters, rear window unbroken! I've
never looked at a Targa or convertible in quite the same way since. I guess
the moral of the story is to look both ways at stop signs and when proceeding

Alan Watkins said to try smearing grease around the bleeder fitting
to stop air from being sucked in while using a vaccuum bleeder.

This sounds like it would work. But I'm afraid that some might get sucked
into the caliper. Stan said that you could use some sort of sealer, but only
during a rebuild or it would contaminate the brake fluid. I wonder if a
silicon based grease would be better? I think I'll end up using some type of
pressure bleeder, through the brake reservoir cap. This seems foolproof, but
I'm worried about blowing out the reservoir or the lines that connect to it
(they don't seem to be designed for high pressures). Any comments?

Well, thanks to the list and a couple of good mechanics I figured out that
the clicking sound emanating from under my 87 944S was probably a clutch
problem.  The mechanic wants $1100 to $1300 to fix it.  I'm probably going
to go ahead and let him do it but...how hard is it to get in there and fix
it yourself?  Are there any special tools required?  Any major access
problems?

If I have the mechanic fix it...what clutch kit works the best?  Do y'all
prefer the rubber center (that came with the original) or springs (any
particular brand?)  Any problems with the Eurostile clutch kit?  If anyone
has gone through this before any help or comments would be greatly
appreciated.

Subject: more brake problems

Hi,
I'm looking for more 'philes wisdom on brakes, I have what is essentially
a lot of pedal travel at the beginning, then firmer pedal as force is
increased, then springy to the end of travel.
  I previously took the advice here to replace my hoses with oem rubber, not
stainless, and in doing that job I knew some of the hard lines would be
damaged, so I got 8 new ones.  Well, satisfied by a job completed and not
too scraped and cut up, I haven't improved my brakes, and I've done
nearly everything I know of: 
 (a) rubber lines are new
 (b) all hard lines which contact rubber lines are new
 (c) all upper bleed nipples used to bleed system with mityvac and then
     with homemade positive pressure device.
 (d) had wife press brake pedal while I loosened line ends on rear brake
     pressure regulator (per James Pasha suggestion on list)
 (e) played with pedal to adjust 'free play'.  Only way I could do this
     is to tighten too much and then back off until car just rolled freely
 (f) all pads and rotor surfaces are wearing (and evenly I think) so I don't
     have any stuck pistons

So the only things left are maybe master cylinder or regulator or calipers
are bad, or there's air I can't get out.  Any help would be appreciated
since I don't know what else to try short of replacing items.  Thanks!

Ted's suggestions are good, but I'd put the emphasis a little differently.

Don't worry if you hit a few cones, but also don't worry about going
fast.

What you want to do is learn how to (1) determine and then (2) drive 
the correct line.

If you drive the correct line, you will go faster with time.  If you don't 
drive the correct line, your speed will be limited by the line you are 
driving.

Smooth is important, keeping the wheels as straight as possible is 
important, but nothing is as important (particularly to a beginner) as
learning the correct line.

An example:

Last summer I had a student at the zone 7 school that *just would
not slow down* for one corner.  As a result, he fought both the car and
the course for about 100 yards after the corner.

Finally, I made him stop on the course, got him to the turn-in point,
pointed down the course and said "look!"

What he saw was a straight, clear section of track.  The previous 
laps, when he'd come into the corner too fast, he'd seen 3 corners 
full of cones that he had to fight through instead of a straight.

What had happened: entering the corner too fast had thrown him off 
line at the exit.  Instead of exiting on the inside of the turn - where 
he could line up the next couple of turns as an essentially straight 
section, he'd exited on the outside - where the next couple of turns
kept him cranking the wheel back-and-forth (and going slow ) to 
stay on the course.

We both learned a lot from this experience: he  picked up about 10 
mph by the end of the straight (actually, he missed his braking point 
at the end of the straight because he was going so much faster); I 
learned that with some students you can tell them "we're going to 
do is this way because..." once, and with some you have to tell them
why something works several times *and then* back it up with an 
example.

Sure, push the car and yourself; it's lot's of fun.

Be sure you pay attention to what your instructor says about where the
car should be and why.

The correct line *never* goes though the cones... [unfortunately ;-)]

It's like they say about real estate: the three most important things
are location, location, and location.

Kevin,

Got it - I wasn't sure those were the ones you meant. I have never provided
such records to an insurance agency before (guess they've always gotten
them on thier own), but can certainly see the value in getting them ahead
of applying with a new company, and checking their accuracy to boot.

Ted, I am not an auto-X'er so I don't have a specific recommendation for
your situation. I do know that if you are going to race on street radials
they cannot be expected to last as long as when they are used in highway
service due to strain on the tread elements, heat and abrasion.

For competitive driving on dry pavement you should get best results with
tires shaved to racing depth. For wet pavement the tread depth should be no
less than 8/32".

If you are using the car for both purposes I would recommend separate
tire/wheel combinations for each. Otherwise you are compromising
performance and tire life/safety.

The coupons can only be used when purchasing tires from an authorized
Goodyear dealer, not from a mail order discounter.

As far as the rubber dust is concerned - this just magically disappears as
airborne particulate matter.

Well, since poeple are talking about SuperChips again, I though I'd
mention an interesting tidbit I learned about the other day:

Me and my friend Todd are working on reverse engineering the engine
computer in his Turbo Eagle Talon AWD.  In the course of our work, we
managed to aquire a SuperChips "modified" Talon computer.  It cost
the original purchaser $350.00, and for that amount of money, what you
did was send in your engine computer and got it back a few days later
supposedly modifed by SuperChips, along with an air bleeder valve which
was to be put in line with the wastegate actuator pressure hose in order to
raise the boost pressure.

So, we opened up the computer.

Sure enough, there was now a SuperChips sticker over the EPROM, and some
of the conformal coating around it was removed, but it did not look like
the EPROM had been de-soldered.  Cool, we thought, SuperChips has been in
this business so long, they've figured out how to program EPROMs in-situ.
But, since we hadn't, I desoldered it and put it in the EPROM reader.

Well, I think you can guess the rest.  The chip had never been removed
because it had never been re-programmed.  It was a completely stock
computer.

So, here's a breakdown of what you get for your money on a SuperChips
modified Talon computer:

	Item		   Value
     ----------         -----------
     bleeder valve     about 10  bucks
     EPROM sticker     about 340 bucks

Oh, and here's something else to drive the point home: we also managed
to aquire a SuperChips modified Stealth computer.  That computer doesn't
even have an external EPROM, rather, the code is embedded within the
microcontroller.  So what did SuperChips do in that case?  They stuck their
sticker on an analog signal conditioning chip!  Oh, and they also
included the 10 dollar bleeder valve.

Of course, everyone feels a difference in power with increased boost,
but a bleeder valve is something anybody can buy at an aquarium store
and install in their car in a few minutes.  What gets me is the
missrepresentation of their product.  They get you to think that they
have some all powerful mystical understanding of your engine computer,
when in fact, they don't know jack (at least for Talons and Stealths).
Can you say fraud?

Now I can't speak for all of their modifed computers, but based on my
two experiences with SuperChips computers, I'd be a bit cautious before
purchacing ANY of their products.

On a final note, I also managed to aquire a Hypertech EPROM for my
Audi TQC.  I dumped it, and found out that IT was stock as well!!  (Yup,
it had a Hypertech sticker on it!)  What you got for you money with the
Hypertech setup was a divided down boost signal, a bleeder valve, and a
sticker.  So at least Hypertech "modified" the computer a little bit, in
that they reduced the signal going from the boost sensor to the input 
Analog to Digital converter electronically, but the total cost in parts for
doing that is literally less than a dollar.  Not only that, it is the
wrong approach to safe boost increases "lying" to the computer about what
the boost really is.  Changing the EPROM lookup tables to match your
increased boost is the rightous way to do this safely.

I guess the moral of this whole story is buyer beware.  If you wanna
shell out tons of dough for an engine computer upgrade, make sure before you
buy it that at least they know more about engine computers and bleeder
valves than you do.

Subject: Porsche Supercup

Hi race fans,
	Kevin asked if anyone knew why Uwe Alzen was disqualified a couple of
times in the Supercup series. (I don't know, but I'd like to.) My question is a
technical one on these cars. In many of the races ESPN has shown passing
attempts where the passer has gone way too deep and is locking up various
numbers of wheels in great clouds of smoke. Well, where the heck is the ABS in

Maybe we're talking original (stoddards) vs repro (tweeks), perhaps the

Gee, hasn't Riesentoter region seen enough curb-surfing at autocrosses
this month?  :-)

For the list- one of our members (who happens to be a pretty good driver)
lost control of his 911 right after crossing the finish line.  He hit a
curb hard enough for me to see the complete underside of his car as he
skipped over the parking lot island.  Major damage to his car.  You
really do have to be pretty careful out there, even in a parking lot...

P.S.  Since he hit a cone after the finish line it was a DNF.  :-)

Dreaming of a Future Porsche
    Hey, all.
    Pano finally caught up with me this weekend--four issues in one
envelope!  I immediately devoured the Tech article on the 993.  Yum.
"Mommy, can I have one?"
    Seeing the front and rear suspensions all laid out in the photos
got me to daydreaming...
    What if Porsche took the suspension as-is (rear subframe and all)
and bolted it into a new body.  My dream also includes swapping the
place of the engine and tranny--making for a new mid-engined car (of
course!)  Two possibilities that immediately leap to mind are the VW
GTI engine (suggested long ago by Soren) or perhaps the Wasser-Boxer
used in the Vanagon (which probably would help with low CG).  Re-
using as many components as possible would help to lower the price of
the car.  Coupe only, or just *maybe* a cab ("Roadster") or Targa.  
Two main goals for the beast:  0.95 + G skidpad figures, $20K - $25K 
baseline price tag.  It might even be possible to do.
    Reborn:  The 914.
    I'd buy one.  (Of course--but I may be predjudiced.)

    Sigh.  But the article about the Bertone 4-seater 993 brought
home to me that this could *never* happen.  One thing mentinoned in
the article was that this kind of vehicle would put Porsche into com-
petition with "high-volume" auto manufacturers, like BMW, Acura, etc.
This dream-car would compete directly with the MR-2s, Miatas, Civic
del Sols, etc.  And Porsche dosen't seem to want to scale up their
production in order to challenge them.

    Too bad my dream is just that--a dream.  What do my Internet
compadres think?

This past weekend, I participated in the PCA Potomac region's Drivers Ed/Time
Trials event at Summit Point. Maybe I'm just entering Porsche ownership puberty
or something, but now I can't go an hour without driving the track in my mind
and thinking about the next event.

This shit is highly addictive - especially after riding with my instructor in
his 350hp 951 clocking lap times in the 1:28 range.  Nearly every corner I was
saying to myself, "there's no f__ing way he's going to make this...", but he
would. What a ride!  Makes even the best rollercoasters seem rather tame.

I especially got a kick out of blowing by 911's and 930's (or at least riding
their ass in the turns until they wave you by).  I guess when they move me up
out of the green run group next time I'll have them riding my ass...

Hi waterpumpers,
	I got up close and personal with the bottom of my '89 951 this weekend
while prepping it for this weekend's PCA club race at Road America. By chance I
noticed splits in the steering rack dust boots. These were VERY hard to see
until I manually pulled the bellows apart. I issue this as a warning because
some corrosion had already started to form on the polished shaft which this dust
boot covers.
	Since my car only has 17,000 miles on it, I'd sure suggest all 944/924
owners have a look. These things are less than $6 (Automotion catalog), but a
new steering rack would be big bux. And who knows how costly a steering failure
at the wrong time would be. Part # is 171.419.831C.
Have a nice day...and be careful out there!

A number of you mentioned that you take one of those cigarette lighter
powered air compressors.  If you haven't gone out and purchased one of these,
I would suggest that instead you get an air tank.  They are cheaper (~$20 vs
~$35) and much faster.  Usually one of these tanks holds 125 psi, and is good
for a nearly 1 to 1 relationship with the pressure in a car's tire.  (ie
watch the guage drop 1 psi, your tire is higher 1 psi.)  This also shows you
where the limit to these tanks is:  if you need to have 45 psi in your front
tires, then your range from the air tank is lessened over those that have
tires at 15 psi.  

Its a bit bulkier, but worth the extra space it takes.

Another item:

~$55 small plastic folding picnic bench.  Seats four people, has hole in
center for a "Prisoner" style umbrella, folded is about the size of two
briefcases end to end (4" x 15" x 35") and fairly lightweight.  

You can get both these items at Target (pronounced Tar-zhay for you

Subject: 944 + ALpine, No AM  - Solved!

  A follow up to a previously posted problem...
  
  After installing an Alpine head unit in an 85.5 944, everything
  worked except AM reception.  Sounded as if no antenna was installed, 
  but FM reception was fine.  The Haynes manual showed a white
  wire going between antenna and radio in addition to the
  normal antenna cable, but no white appeared in my harness.
  
  Solution?  Connected a _black_ wire that was in the harness
  to a wire on the Alpine used for "powered antenna".  This is the
  same wire that is also used to trigger motor-driven antennas, butin
  this case allows juice to flow thru the in-windshield antenna.  The
  wire has two connectors on it in case you wanted to attach the 
  head unit that had a powered antenna that was also motorized.
  
  If the difference between "power antenna" and "powered antenna" is
  ambigous to you, you'll understand why I didn't think I had any
  more connections to make after the first installation.

Apparently, no purpose!  There has been a tech bulletin that says to remove

It's possible the original purpose was emissions abatement.  If nasty engine

Keep the pressure at about 15 PSI, and you will avoid damaging the

Michael,
	Interesting story about your 914. My 914 had an ignition timing
problem, so I took out the engine and tapped it on the ground. It didn't
work. The truth of the matter is that this is NOT a new method. It is
standard procedure for quality control at Lucas.

Seriously, it's a good tip that could probably save you in the middle of a

a) upgrade tires and wheels (does this mean higher, wider, both? and are

Subject: A Guru has Died    





     1994 was not a good year for Gurus. First the Maestro's

Old Man passed away three days into the New Year.  Then Gary

Kildall died.

     And just today, Monday 29 August, 1994 the Maestro was

informed of the death of another True Guru- Richard Lukes-

the "Lukes" part of "Luke's & Shoreman". Although Ritchie

had not been associated with Lukes & Shoreman for many

moons, his active mind and body kept him involved in many

Porsche 356 Projects.

     Ritchie worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs in the '30's

and '40's- making Cyclotrons, exotic equipment and who knows, 

maybe parts for the Bomb. Whatever he made, it was Good.

    Ritchie also got involved in motorcycle racing and

eventually, Porsche Racing. The little modifications he made

to the engines always allowed his race car to go just a

little bit faster than the Competition. He drove the

competition nuts.

    Ritchie was the first to come up with the extension on

356 push rod tubes to keep the oil in the sump from flowing

into the rocker box area during hard turns. Since the

extension was hidden inside the case it was invisible to all

but Superman. Again, his competitors never knew how Ritchie

kept his oil in the sump on corners. 

     Eventually Porsche got wind of the idea and

    Sadly, poor Ritchie didn't finish the restoration.

Another lesson to all- to do it NOW! There may not be a Tomorrow.

     To the Maestro, the memory of Richard Lukes and Dean

Subject: Re:  Blake Breeder tools

For brake/clutch bleeding, I took the advice of a porschephiles item
from a year or two ago and made my own pressure bleeder. Combine an
inexpensive plant sprayer from Home Depot, a master cylinder reservoir
cap from a junkyard VW (hey, this is a German car, and surely they
standardize those things, right), a quick-release coupling from an
auto parts store, and a fitting to connect the line through the cap
(from a marine supply store, I think), and voila, a $30 pressure
bleeder. A dozen strokes of the pump build up enough pressure to
bleed the whole system.

It makes sense to me to use pressure rather than vacuum (at the other
end) to bleed the system - no concern about emptying the reservoir
accidentally, no air sneaking in so you can't tell when the bubbles
have stopped. Only disadvantage I can see is that it makes it easy to
waste fluid, since there is so little effort involved, just open the
bleeder screw and "out goes the bad fluid, in comes the good."

I just purchased a 88 944T with less than 31K miles.  Please help me out with 
a few issues that I am trying to work through.

1.  I am hearing various opinions from folks about when I should replace the 
timing belt.  One Porsche mechanic that I spoke with said that 30K miles is 
about when he would replace the belts.  The manual says something around 45K 
miles and Porsche dealer that inspected the car said that I can wait until 40+ 
K miles.  What are your experiences with the timing belt?  Is there any way to 
reduce the frequency in which the belt will have to be adjusted?

2.  I learned that the lighter doesn't work after I picked up the car.  I 
guess no radar detector or flat replacement for now.  I checked the fuse, 
which looks fine.  Is this a simple fix (I am very very new to this)?  What 
can I do to remedy this?

3.  What's a good heavy duty car cover?  I have to park the car outdoors now 
while I look for indoor parking.  Does anyone have any experience with the new 
evolution 4 material from Kimberly Clark?  The ad looks interesting and sounds 
as if it would be a good material for a car cover.  Any recommendations?

GUILTY!

When we first came to the US we had never seen a Talon because they don't 
have them in England. When we first opened the box there was no EPROM. It 
is only the early cars which had the EPROM, the later ones had the 
program in the CPU and it was not possible to read it or reprogram it 
without a lot more information than we had. So we played with the car and 
found we could get about at 15-20% increase in performance by increasing 
the boost pressure. So we made up a kit and sold it on our try it and see 
basis. None were returned as unsatisfactory.

One thing we did find was that the boost limit was dynamic. ie 
you could run as much boost as you wanted providing the injectors could 
supply enough fuel. So we started on the design of our boost graphic 
which was a device which would allow boost pressure to be controlled at 
500 RPM increments. This way we could have 25 PSI boost on a Talon with 
the stock computer. As soon as we had it perfected we withdrew the Talon 
and Stealth conversions and just sold the boost graphic for Mitsubishi's.

We sold about 20 Talon and 5 Stealth conversions ands all of the 
customers seem to be contented. We have sold 400 Boost Graphics! If you have 
the early Talon computer 
with the EPROM, hang on to it because it is the only way you can actually 
reprogram it to use larger injectors but you only need 
to do this if 25 
PSI boost is not enough. In other words, don't waste your time trying to 
reprogram the Talon computer, if you want to do it yourself, make a boost 
graphic.

The Audi computers are different in that they are 90% ignition and 10 % 
fuel control as the fuel system is mechanical. The easy and cheap way to 
reproram them is with a resistor and a zener to clamp the map sensor 
voltage and that gives fixed timing over a certain boost level. This is 
fine for most applications working within the limits of the fuel system. 
Once you go over that limit, the map sensor does not have enough range 
to read the boost correctly. Then you need to replace it and then you 
are in fore some heavy reprogramming.

Don't tar us all with the same brush. The company in Florida is Total 
Audi Performance and they are selling copies of chips created by us and 
our competitors in England. If you don't buy an Audi chip from us buy it 
from Intended Acceleration but do not buy a pirated copy from TAP. And 
just in case there is any confusion Superchips Inc has nothing at all to 
do with ADS SuperChips

It was a LONG time ago ... a 90mph 911 was coming off the bridge
southbound and crossed the median on Doyle Drive .... the resulting
mess killed a few people and was quite infamous.

Another famous 911 story from the San Francisco area involved
one of the Mitchell Brothers (porn film makers etc.)  Back in the early
70's, one of the Mitchell brothers bought a new 911.  Then, he noticed
all of thses other 911 drivers flashing lights at him. He was really
pissed....he was quoted as saying "I didn't join any damn club..." .
So, to cut down on the flashers, he took his nice 911 home, and gave
it a speay can paint job in flat gray. Made it really ugly. He said the
flashing stopped!

I'm assuming that the reason Alzen was disqualified was for modifying the brain
box for the fuel injection, or for altering the intake plenum...

In regards to the ABS issue, even if you do have ABS, you are still going to
smoke your tires if you are using racing slicks and coming into a chicane at
160 mph.  There is only so much that ABS-5 can do to counter basic laws of

Dear Porsche friends:
	Well, it happened again! Yesterday I bought a 1985 (early) 944.

It has +91K miles. Has had H2O pump replaced, timing belt and motor mounts
done recently. It also has a new clutch. 

The owner was selling due to an expanding family...

Car is solid. Options include leather, cruise, sway bars, rear wiper, headlight
washers. It seems to be a little neglected in the cosmetic category. It is
a faded Guards Red. I think it will compound out nicely. It really does not
matter since this will be mostly a track car.

Interior needs cleanning up also. It looks like it is all there...

BTW, how do I access the antenna. I need to replace it since previous owner's
wife had car wash take care of it. It seems to be an automatic one. Am I right?

Any way, looking forward to following the 944 threads in addition of 911s

Hi, Lance.
 
I may not know it all, but I know where to find out. In this case
Christophorus, No. 3/94. I have the German version but the English is
probably the same. There are two articles on the 911 Cup 3.8, one a tech
overview and one a driving impression piece. The tech overview states twice,
once in text and once in spec chart, that the cars have the
latest-generation ABS, "matched to race car requirements." If they are
locking up, perhaps this info is wrong, or the drivers turn it off, or
something else eliminates/disables the ABS? I don't know...  Lots of race
drivers don't like ABS, they feel they can do better without it.

Subject: 914 questions and advice sought.

Hello All,

        I have a few questions regarding my recently acquired '74 914
2.0L. I purchased the car to become a full bred autocrosser, but for
now it will be a daily driver as well. My first round of investments
are to simply get the car into shape, and working smoothly. After that
, I'll start looking into suspension upgrades.

What I've done already:

replaced all vacuum hoses + vacuum inhibit valve + air bypass valve,
this improved the running drastically. (how do I replace the short
hoses at the begining of the intake runners? And how hard is it to
replace the injector seals?)
        
replaced the speedo drive o-ring. (this was more annoying than
difficult).



What I plan on or need to pay attention to:

There is a bearing that's on it's way out in the tranny. Makes a loud
whiring sound under load. More noticable at higher speeds in higher
gears. QUESTION: does this sound like a tranny rebuild or just a "
simple fix"? $?

Concern about buring oil: I use about 1qt every 4-500 miles, and blue
smoke is seen when I'm compression braking at higher RPMs. I'm told
that a) the 914 is expected to burn 1qt every 600mi, and b) the smoke
is the result of slightly worn valve guides. Any suggestions?

Upgrade/Modify the throttle body to allow use of the vacuum advance.

The tach bounces around wildly when ever there's a quick change in RPM
, e.g. when I shift without double clutching. Is there any way to 
smooth this out?

I'd like to find out about the addition of a large oil cooler. Any
comments or suggestions would be greatly appreceated. I found that the
other day, when stuck in traffic that the temp went WAY high, just
under the red,and I was very concerned for the engine. It did have a
tendency to want to stall when hot, and low end power was way
diminished. Anything that can be done here? Any "How-To"s

There is a very slight bucking in the fuel (?) system when cruising at
low throttle. Taping on the gas clears in up. It's random, and
sometimes is far more noticable than others. Any Ideas? I cannot
duplicate it by modulating the gas pedal myself, it's too sharp of an
effect.

Upgrade to H-4 headlights? can I do this??

Any suggestions on exhaust systems? What kind of gains can be expected
? Noise levels?


So, Thanks for any help or advice you can offer.

Subject: porsches in Ireland

just returned from a trip to ireland. the aer lingus magazine had an
article on the new 911, and quoted 220 porsches in the country of all
years. I saw two, a 924s and a recent 911, didn't pickup on the plates
though, could have been from the continent. after driving on the roads for
a week i see why no one bothers: petrol is ~60P a litre and the roads are
are about 1% larger than your average microcar. the locals can handle that,
but the other tourons (tourist + moron) forced me into the hedges twice...

Subject: 911 dolly ideas

My idea for a 911 engine/tranny dolly, comments please:

a "spine" made from a 2x4 on edge, runs from the front of the engine casting
to the rear tranny mount.  This spine has blocks of 2x4 on at a 3 or four
places down it's length to support the engine/tranny on a couple of
casting points along their respective cases without putting weight on
heat exchanger or other "sensitive" areas, or putting any cantilever
stress on the tranny/engine join (so mating/demating is easier).

The spine would be strengthened by two "L" pieces of angle iron at the
bottom running it's length so:
       +---+
       |   |
       |   |
      ||   ||
      ||   ||
   ---++---++---
The spine would also have 3 or four castors along it's length.  Attached
to the spine near the front of the engine would be two "outriggers"
crucifix style, with wooden blocks under the cam tower and castors at the
ends, to provide side-to-side stability.  At the tranny end of the spine,
and at the end of each outrigger would be a hole in the angle iron
through which a large diameter threaded rod would run.  The idea being
to position the dolly with engine/tranny under the car, then use a lever
and block to lift it up a few inches, then run a nut up the threaded rod
to slowly lift the dolly the few inches necessary.

Subject: Re: 356 engine rebuild question

Dear Denny:

  Re: the 356C you're looking at:   The ".020" overbore means that the Case
is bored 0.5mm or Second Over.  Align Bore Main Bearings that are 2nd over
are VERY expensive (like $495/set), and not available from Porsche. Also- why
did the Case need to be align bored TWICE anyhow? Two terrible overhauls,
maybe?  At a mere 67K miles??? A Good, Standard Case is a nice thing to have.
    Since the crank was ground, do you know what undersize it is now?  First
Under is OK, if done by a good crank grinder. Third Under is Bad News, as
that's the last time! Second Under is frowned upon.
  The NPR 86mm, 1720cc kit is quite good- and as long as the compression is
kept below 9:1, will go over 100,000 miles, by actual demonstration. However,
with flycut cylinder heads, there should be a thick (1mm)  copper shim under
the cylinders to lower the compression- otherwise the NPR set WILL
self-destruct in 20-40,000 miles. 
     Where #2 cylinder joins the case, one can sometimes see a bit of the
Thick (1mm), Copper Gasket.  The thin (0.25mm) copper gasket won't be
visible.
     The "35 degree" shave is probably a 30 degree Conical Cut done to clean
up the combustion chamber. It helps to lower compression a bit too.
    The right way is to "cc" the Cylinder Head after the valves  (and spark
plug) installed, to measure the Head Volume. I do each of the 4 holes,  using
the better or larger volume head on the #3/#4 side. If the heads are off more
than 1cc, they can be differentially shimmed to make the Net Squish volume
more even. Usually, matched sets of heads will be within 0.2cc which makes
for a VERY smooth running engine. Net Squish can also be measured on an
assembled engine, through the plug hole as a final check. A compression Ratio
of 9.0:1 with the NPR  Big Bore Kit requires a New Squish of 53cc.
     More Important than the engine however is the body. If there's evidence
of Rust, it's way too expensive. If it's a rust-free California Car- hey they
ain't making any more of them, and there's only a finite number left.
     If you'll send me the Chassis ID Number and Engine Number, I'll ask my
Data Base whether they match, and give you a printout of other engines/cars
that warmly surround your candidate vehicle.
Boy, isn't this InfoBahn GREAT???

 Keep the 356 Faith!

Subject: Starting Problem

I have a problem with my '72 911T, MFI

This morning, I drove to work as usual - no problem.  But then about 1/2
hour after I got here, and associate and I decided to to go the Arches to
get somehting to eat, and to take my car.

Much to my embarrassment, it wouldn't start.  

This is a very sudden development, since for the last six years, it has 
never failed to start for me, dead batteries notwitstanding. (I didn't drive
it for 6 months once)

It has plenty of battery power (I replaced both in December) and turns over
just fine, but it just doesn't "catch."

There have been times when it will start but will not run properly for
about 10-15 seconds, kinda like it needs to clear its throat.  You know,
that kind up hesitation when you try to run up the idle.

Anyway, I'm stuck. 

Where should I start?  I was thinking of checking to make sure that I have
spark, but I don't know of a good method to check for fuel.  I think I smell
gas, but I'm not sure.  I forgot to listen for the fuel pump, so I'll do
that when I go back out to look at it again.

Any ideas would be apprecitated!

Found it!

As you may recall, this AM I had a dead 911, wouldn't start.  This had 
never happened before in the 6 years I'd owned the car.

Here's why:

The tab on the back of the rotor, which is part of the rev-limiter, broke.
Why?  Who knows!  Essentially, I am perpetually rev-limited (at 0 RPM) until 
I can sweet-talk someone into giving me a ride down to AutoSport to get a 
new one.  

Plus, I guess I should try to find the rest of the parts in the 
distributor...

Thanks for the help!

My recommendation:

all the parts are happy together
3. disconnect power to CDI, and/or coil from distributor
4. crank till you see oil pressure
5. crank, rest, crank, rest for another minute or so
6. look engine over carefully for embarrassing leaks
7. reconnect ignition

Steve Stomski suggested that I forward E-mail race reports, etc., "to
Porschephiles for all our reading."

I've  turned down several requests from P'philes (who are not themselves
editors and who have not volunteered to help an editor who is not on
Internet) to receive this stuff directly because of their personal interest.
I can understand their interest, however it would add greatly to my work of
sending individual E-mail messages to editors. Plus, those providing me
information have the understanding that it is for PCA newsletter editors to
put in their newsletters (if they wish). While this stuff is not secret, and
most providers would probably agree to a broader distribution, it would be a
lot more work for me and right now I'm up to my eyebrows in alligators.

For those reasons and because most of the E-mail messages are from 10 to
30k, I also don't want to post them on the Porschephiles mail list. I'm
close to unsubscribing now simply because I can't handle the message
traffic. If I'm gone for a couple of days, I've got to get the help of the
Sysop of my users group BBS to empty my mail box. 

My job is to help PCA regional newsletter editors. The Internet thing is
merely part of that job, and it's taking a lot of my time, but there's not a
more appreciative bunch of people on this earth. So, how can I stop?

Lou, congratulations on your new purchase!  (Hope you got it cheap...You 
didn't happen to get it from a slightly wild woman from Utah, did you?)

Anyhow, about the antenna in a 1984 944...To get to it, you have to remove
the charcoal canister in the driver side fender ( a couple of 10 mm sheet
metal screws, as I recall) and remove the hose clamps that attach (of
course) hoses to the canister.

At that point, the lower part of the antenna motor is visible.  The bottom
is held in place by a 10 mm nut and washer, the top is held in place by the
chrome or black nut over the top of the antenna (on the outside of the
fender).  Be careful when removing the nut, because it holds several things
in place.  As you release the nut, the entire assembly comes free...

The original equipment antennas are extremely expensive, on the order of
$300.  Replacement antennas (antennae?) are available from Imparts in St.
Louis or Crutchfield in Charlottesville, VA...Prices for these non-original
antennas are in the $80 range. They fit fairly well, but not exactly...If
you are going to concours, spend the money and keep your originality points.

Of the early 944 cars that I have bought recently, not one OE antenna was
unbroken...

You adjust the pivot points inside the trunk area and the inner fender area.
 Three allen headed bolts are loosened inside the trucn and two in the fender

 No.....what they are saying is that if the car came a certain way, then it
 must be run that way to remain stock.  Most early 911's came with 6x15 
 wheels and in order to run in stock, yours must have the same.  Thats why 
 you say many 911's at the autocross with narrow tires (i.e. thats all 
 they can run in their respective classes.

To whomever had the transmission which clunks shifting into second or
reverse.  This sounds like a bent shift rod.  If you had any work
done recently which required removing the transmission, perhaps the
mechanic bent the rod as it enters the rear transmission case, when
he lowered the transmission.

Subject: 914 steering probs

I seem to be haveing some steering problems with my 74 914. About
two weeks ago on a trip to florida I noticed that the steering was
getting a little sloppy on the interstate. During a fast lane change
she felt like she was pivoting, and hesitating instead of the usual
fast snap into the far lane. It is hard to explane this strange
"pivot" feeling but that is the only way I can describe it. Since
that trip I have noticed it more and more. It almost feels like there
is a 500 lb. weight in the trunk. Around long curves, like on-ramps,
she feels real loose and instead of whiping out of it, she kinda
"slids" out. I am not talking tire tearing slid but not like before.
If I hit a bump in a turn the steering wheel jump around and I have
to fight it way too much. I can not see anything loose are wrong.
The tire pressure is correct. If anyone has a clue or even a
suspicion to what it might be, please let me know. I want my sharp
handling 914 back :(

Subject: 911s, Kids and the Capital Review Board


Help!!

I'm waffling, and need opinions and advice :-(

I have one little girl (3 yrs old), and another child expected anyday. I also have
an old bagged honda beater and a 92 Pathfinder (and no Porsche yet!!). 

My Capital Review Board (ala "spousal unit") has agreed to allow for a purchase of
"any" vehicle of my choice under $25K (CDN) next spring. She knows that I have longed for a 
911 for years (I came close a few years back, but the new house purchase squished
that idea!), and she is aggreable to the idea.

Now the questions:

1) Although the Pathfinder will be the "core" transport for the kids, I will need
   to take them in the 911. Any experiences (bad and good) with two kids in the "emergency"
   seats? (I will need kid seats for a while ).

2) I have done my research, and will target a late SC (82-83) or an Carrera (84+). Do I go for
   a low milage SC, or a higher milage Carrera?

   How reliable are these cars anyways? (wow, that is a loaded question!) :^)

   The reason I ask is that looking at the prices for 911 parts and rebuilds is
   enough to scare my Capital Review Board silly...

   (You tend to get a skewered idea about the reliability because the discussions on this group
   may not reflect the typical owner profile or vehicles!!)

3) I will use the honda in the winter, and the Porsche in the spring, summer and fall. It 
   will have to be a RELIABLE commuter car. Unfortunately, my commute is quite short (very
   bad bus service), so it will be hard on the car because of the lack of warming up (it
   most likely takes some time to warm up that 11 liters of oil :^) ) It also has to back up the
   Pathfinder.

   With frequent oil changes, is this going to be a problem?

4) I am fairly handy mechanically (ie. I have changed a few clutches, changed cams on a
   Honda, but not heavy duty internal engine stuff )...

   I am hoping that I can cover most of the 911 Maintenance myself (ie. valves, tuneups, oil
   changes (this should be okay ), brakes...) Does this seem reasonable?


Thanks for any opinions in advance!!

Folks,

I am in the market for a quality pyrometer and a quality tire pressure
gauge. I like to get high quality tools but the best is not required
here.  The pyrometer should be geared towards automotive usage.  I
prefer a dedicated pyrometer, not one that is part of a multimeter.
The tire pressure gauge must be durable and be easy to use at an autox.

The questions are:

1. What brands are best?
2. How much do they cost?
3. Where do I get them?

I live in the Bay Area (San Jose), so a source near here is preferred.

Thanks in advance for the sage advice (Ted need not apply <grin>),

Allen,

I have had good luck with Wheel Works.  They match the prices at
Teletire.  Also they have the new balancing machines that grind the
high spots on the tires to give a very good balance.  But it is best
to actualy watch them working on the wheels to make sure they don't
use a screw driver as a chisel to get the old lead waits off the wheel.

The short hoses require that you basicly take the whole induction system
off the car. It's a full day job, but it's *NOT* too hard. The injector
seals is about a 3 hour job that is really pretty easy, but if you think
you need to do the short hoses, do them at the same time...

There's no such thing as a cheap fix to a 914 transmission. The best
thing to do is use it until you can't then replace it with a rebuilt
unit that has a 12 month, 12000 mile warranty for about a kilobuck.

That's too much oil, and you won't know if it's valve guides or rings
or bearings until you do a leak-down test.

Excuse me, but what are you talking about? You already use vacuum

Large oil coolers are best used in engines with high  capacity Melling
oil pumps. That requires (at minimum) taking the engine out of the
car and dropping in a new pump. 

The "hot setup" for oil coolers is from Bernie Bergman, who sells
a VW Beetle setup that includes the external cooler, the thermostat 
so as not to cool oil that's already too cool, a fan for the cooler
and a thermostat for the fan, and a remote oil filter gizmo for about 
$180. Find his ad (from time to time) in Hot VWs. That's the best
price anywhere for that assortment of stuff.

Check the archives -- I spent a *LONG* time in '93 talking about 
how to really make the oil system work in 914 performance applications.

For full race, there are some options. For around town, you're better off
with the stock heat exchangers and maybe a Bursch muffler.

Seems a little low, but my 2.0 is a full race *only* car, so I have

Hi, Derek. 
  
You get what you pay for in chrome. I used Lemon Grove Plating in National 
City. They did all the chrome on my 356 for about $1700. There is a 
difference between cheap lowrider chrome and a true three-layer 
copper-nickel-chrome job (I think that's the materials, no flames please). 
Lemon Grove can even fix pitted pot metal parts and straighten dents. I got 
a cheap set of Hella foglights that way -- dented, corroded housings, for a 
very nominal fee they undented and plated them. Viola, $800 foglights for 
about $200 total investment. 
  
I have their number somewhere, but the 619 directory assistance can help. 
  
Sending the stuff overseas is probably not a good idea, because U.S. 
customs will want you to pay duty on the value of the work performed.

Subject: Monterey Vintage Weekend - Porsche Auction Prices


Listed below are the Porsche prices bid during the two evenings of auctions 
sponsored by Don Williams at the Doubletree Hotel and held in conjunction with 
the Monterey Historic Automobile Races at Laguna Seca. 
 
In general the prices were all over the map, with several outstanding cars 
going for prices far below what was generally considered to be their fair 
market value. 
 
Prices in <brackets> indicate that the vehicle did not sell because the 
seller's reserve was not exceeded. 
 
The cars are listed roughly in the order in which they were offered for sale, 
although there were a number of intervening cars.  There were a total of ~185 
cars offered during the two evenings. 
 
   1981 Porsche 930 race car - $22.5K 
 
   1975 Porsche 914 2.0 liter with 943 "certified" miles (a perfect car that   
      seemed to be exactly as advertised) - $17K 
 
   1960 Porsche Carrera GS/GT - $107K 
 
   1963 Porsche Carrera 2 - <$53.5K> 
 
   1957 Porsche 550 RS Spyder - <$175K> 
 
   1954 Porsche 356 Speedster - $46.5K (seemed about right; the car looked     
      great!) 
 
   1962 Porsche 356B Super Cabriolet - $26K (apparently recognized for what it 
       was - a rough, incomplete car that was at least $15-20K away from       
       concours condition) 
 
By the way, both days of the racing at Laguna Seca were exactly as described 
in the message posted previously by Stan.  One of the highlights on Sunday was 
seeing a 1971 Porsche 917K run away and but not quite hide from all the 
Ferraris during the featured race of the "Ferrari Weekend."  (Ferrari was the 
featured make this year.)  
 
It's a terrific weekend.  Among those in evidence throughout the weekend were 
Phil Hill, Carroll Shelby, and Derek Bell. 
 
If you live on the West Coast it is definitely worth the trip, but make your 
reservations early.  Apparently, there wasn't a hotel room to be had within 10 
miles of Laguna Seca during the weekend and as a result there were lots of 
people sleeping in cars on Saturday evening!

Hi, Joe.
 
The 1995 featured marque? You mean Bugatti? <g>
 
To others on the list who may not be familiar with the current status of
auto industry intermarriage, Bugatti owns Lotus. But Bugatti is virtually
unknown in the U.S. so you might as well have a Lotus feature. There aren't
enough Bugattis in the U.S. to support a marketable event, but there are
plenty (relatively speaking) Lotii. Also Bugatti gets to unveil the EB 112
in the U.S.
 
There are all sorts of rumors about where Bugatti gets its money to do these
superexotics (everything from oil money to drug money to Mafia laundering
schemes) but the truth is probably a lot simpler: the French aerospace
industry is very heavily involved.
 
I was at the French unveiling of the EB 110 a few years ago, the two days
after its premiere in Paris they brought down a bunch of test mules and the
first car with production bodywork to the old Bugatti plant in Molsheim,
outside Strasbourg, and the following day to Mulhouse where they drove it on
closed roads in a park, along with the "Seventh Royale" (built by the French
National Automobile Museum from parts left over and a spare Bugatti railway
engine). I was able to talk to some of the engineers who worked on the EB
110, and have to say that these guys are serious about building a modern
high-tech, high-performance exotic car. No "Vector" scam here. That trip will
always be one of my most memorable European trips, 'cause I got to be there
at the start.

Subject: Easi-bleed

I just got back from a car testing trip to Phoenix, a couple of hotrodded
new generation Mustangs. One car was built by Baer Racing, which put all of
its suspension tweaks on one. They use Brembo calipers almost identical to
those Porsche uses, and cross-drilled rotors. Watching them work, I asked
why they were still bleeding brakes with one guy in the car pushing the
pedal. Hal Baer said that they feel the pressure bleeder could introduce
cavitation (very small bubbles.) Also pumping too quickly can introduce
bubbles. OK, point noted, but I usually work alone so I will continue to
use my home-made pressure bleeder setup. I use very low pressure, maybe
10 psi.
 
Kevin Gross also pointed out the cavitation possibility.
 
John White describes a homemade pressure bleeder that sounds just like mine,
except for the pressure sprayer part, I use shop air. John comments on the
only drawback is that you might waste fluid. It's good, even desirable, to
"waste" fluid because you want to flush all that old stuff out completely,
not just at the calipers, and because you might as well use up all of the
fluid you just bought, as it keeps only marginally better in the opened can 
than it does in the fluid reservoir. Porsche has recommended a complete 
system flush every two years regardless, and have now increased it to 3 years 
with the new DOT 4-200 fluid. Tests done in Germany in a humid test cell have 
shown appreciable drop in wet boiling point after only a few hours, equivalent 
to driving around for one rainy week or so.

Subject: '72 Starting Problem

And now the conclusion....

('72 911 won't start)

I was staring at the rotor on my desk here at work yesterday, while waiting
for my SO to get me a new one, when I realized that the rev-limiter's 
demise should not be causing the car to not run.  The juice flows from the
top of the cap (coil wire) thru the rotor and to the indiviual cylinders,
and there was no break in that circuit - the rev-limiter does not break
the circuit - it GROUNDS it, and thus eliminating spark.

I therefore reasoned that something ELSE must be keeping it from starting...

I grabbed a flashlight and went back out to look at it. Sure enough, the
spring had attached itself to the points!  I fished it out and a couple of
little pieces of plastic, put the rotor back in and VROOM!

Well, I saved myself $35, but I'll spend it anyway 'cause I do like to
have the rev-limiter.  At least i wasn't stranded at work any more!

Thanks again for the suggestions

Subject: 911 engine rebuild notes

I started to write up my engine rebuild notes for this list last night,
but realized that, unlike the removal/disassmbly process, this is
very well documented elsewhere.  Therefore I won't be writing up many
notes.  I have the following observations to make however:

1.  Use plenty of ziploc bags, write what the contents are on the outside 
    with a spirit pen.  The smaller divisions between assemblies you can
    make the better (ie more bags).

2.  Write plenty of notes to yourself during disassembly, you may think
    you'll remember what goes where when you put it back together-you won't!

3.  Read all the available information on the part of the project you're
    about to tackle.  When you think you know it all, read it again.  Take
    notes of the things that the various authors mention to watch out for.

4.  I found the technique for centering the rocker arm shafts with a feeler
    gauge to be at best inaccurate and at worst unusable.  I checked them
    out with a caliper and found that with the end cap flush with the
    outside of the smaller bearing area then shaft is in the correct position.
    (There are two bearings for each shaft one is wider than the other).

5.  The minimum reading is Bruces book, Porsche factory book, Haynes
    (Haynes simply because it presents some information differently
    which may help make some things clearer).

6.  The cylinder baffling goes on *BEFORE* the cam towers (Don't Ask Me How
    I Know (tm))

7.  Once the basic block is built up, and the exhaust is on it's easier to
    put it back on the dolly (if you use one) and complete the buildup
    there.

8.  Make sure all O-ring lead-in chamfers in the castings are smooth and
    thoroughly de-burred.  Especially if you're updating to pressure
    tensioners - mine were pretty good but still needed a little smoothing.

9.  Make sure you lubricate O rings well.

10. I found it easiest to put the pistons into the cylinders with a clutch
    type ring compressor far enough to hold all the rings but still leave
    the hole for the wrist pin clear, then put the cylinder/piston combo
    in place and put in the pin.

11. Don't plan on removing old cylinder studs yourself unless you
    *REALLY* know what you're doing.  Just pay someone the flat rate fee
    to do it.  Mine were a *REAL* bitch to get out.

12. If updating to pressure tensioners, you'll need to make sure the
    tensioner oil lines are well clear of castings, AC brackets etc - 
    you really don't want to chafe through one of these.

13. Putting the engine down on your hand is a Bad Idea(tm)

Hi. Just went though some of the same 914 (1973 2.0L) fixing up
as you are describing.  We had two problems which sound similar to
yours:

(a) The Aux air valve was stuck open. We always idled too
high. I plugged up that line with a marble, so that the car idles
poorly on startup, but then after 1 minute or so it is fine; we are
awaiting the part (Auto Atlanta was ridiculous, finally told me that
they fixed used ones by squirting wd-40 into the frozen part and
hoped they then worked...or would sell me a new one for $295.) Bought
a used one at PartWerks in Chicago for $40 or $45. We'll see how (if)
that works. If not, Stoddard has new ones for $160 or so. we'll see.

(b) The variable bucking and uneven returns to idle on our car really
stumped us. I finally realized that the throttle spring was worn. A new
one from the local Porsche dealer completely fixed it. I bet from your 
description that this is your problem too.

About the tach uneveness: We have experienced the same wildness of the 
needle. I ignore it. I think (?) it gets better after the car is warmed
up...but i'm just probably used to it by noe.

Hmmm.  Sounds suspiciously like my 944S over the weekend.  Got up Saturday,

wouldn't run.  Actually, once it fired and stalled, it wouldn't even pretend
to try to fire.  Turned out that the fuel pump relay had quit.  And of course
I couldn't get it replaced until Monday, which meant I had to miss Sunday's

   This is probably my greatest pet peeve about 914's.  Even some of the all
out concours 914's don't have the headlight alignment quite right, and most
others are way off.  The factory seems to have done the best job of this, does
anyone know how they went about it?  I'm guessing that there was one guy who
did nothing but align headlights - no installing, only aligning!!

   There are 3 hex key bolts inside the trunk, and 2 more under the wheel
wells that allow for adjustment of the pivot axis.  Also, after removing the
plastic shield and pulling back the rubber boot, there are 3 more hex key
bolts holding the motor assy. to the car that allow adjustment of the start
or end point of travel.  Make sure that the arm connected to the motor shaft is
at the push/pull extremities when the motor is in the up/down positions. 
Beyond that you kinda have to play with the adjustments to get everything
right.  After aligning 3 lights, the whole process still takes me about 5 hours
for each light.   Patience...

Subject: RE: 944 MM

| From:  <schless@iastate.edu>

< MM procedure goes here>

Schless does not mention the removal of the steering shaft u-joint clamp
bolt. The steering shaft must be removed from the steering rack to facilitate
lowering the cross member. I found that the easiest way to get at this bolt
(and the bolts on the top of the LHS MM) was to remove the air cleaner box.
I left the air meter on the air cleaner box and removed them as a unit. I
also discovered that the u-joint clamp bolt must be removed completely, not
merely loosened.  The power steering fluid tube that runs along the right
side frame rail (near the RHS sway bar mount) is clamped to the frame rail.
The nut that holds the clamp on must be removed so that the tube is free to
move when the cross member is dropped down.

I used a ratcheting box wrench to remove the MM bottom nut.

Also, do *not* loosen the a-arm to cross-member bolts.  Doing so will
necessitate a realignment after reassembly.

I fabricated a facsimile of the engine holder that the shop manual recommends.
It holds the engine from above rather than from beneath. A bottle jack on the
floor seemed like just another thing to get in the way whilst rolling about
under the car.  Besides, I was concerned about supporting the engine's weight
on the cast aluminum pan. If anyone in the Seattle area wants to replace engine
mounts, I would be happy to lend this thing out.

I found that the most difficult part of the procedure was the removal of the
old MMs from the cross member and the insertion of the new ones. Even with
the engine up as high as it seemed it would go (about an inch) and the cross
member pried down about 2 inches, it was still very tight.  The MMs must
be "creatively" rotated about to get them into the cross member and then
rotated again into their final orientation.

On reassembly, only put the MM bolts/nuts on finger tight until the cross
member is bolted tight and the engine lowered back down.  And don't forget
to guide the steering shaft u-joint back onto the rack pinion shaft while
raising the cross member back into position (one guess as to why I say
this :-).

Well, it happened again. This time at a busy intersection in heavy

than my car was!  Had a friend come tow me home.

Next day, I took a 3" piece of wire and attached two male electrical
connectors to it.  I pulled the DME relay and bridged terminals 87b
and 30.  This caused the fuel pump to run. I could hear fuel running
rapidly through the fuel rail.  So I knew my fuel pump was ok. I had
already checked for spark with my timing light.  So I ordered a new DME
relay from the dealer ($43 including tax/shipping).

When it arrived, I tried the old relay again...no start.
Put in new relay...car started!!! Yeah!
Put in old relay...car didnt start.
Put in new relay...car started..has been running since.

So there ya have it.

"Once"?  You make it sound like it was years ago in the dark ages when 
dinosaurs roamed the earth!  8-)

Anyhow, I just thought I would point out that after you and I replaced the 
radiator, I noticed the car was running much hotter than with the old 
radiator.  I attributed it to the heat in Sacramento/ Lake Tahoe and the 
strain of climbing those mountains.  However, even now that I am back in 
Vancouver, I've noticed two things.

First, the car is still running hotter than it did before.  This may be (and 
if fact probably is) related to the brand of coolant we put in (whatever it 
was, I can't remember).  I wouldn't have thought this to be the case, since 
I thought it was all just ethylene glycol.  However, based on the message 
above, it may well be that a change of coolant will solve this problem.

The second thing is that the fan doesn't come on until the temperature gauge 
is in the red and it turns off around the 1/2 notch.  It used to be that it 
came on at 3/4 and turned off at 1/4.  This sounds just like what the 
Porschephile quoted above is experiencing.

I haven't had a chance to deal with all this due to the hectic nature of my 
life lately (new job and all that), and have just been running with my 
air-conditioning on, which forces the fan on all the time.  However, until I 
saw the above message, I assumed that the thermostat that controlled the fan 
was wonked.  Maybe not...

Yes, some Porsche clubs use a points system, but GGR has not since day

written and agreed upon by the voting membership.  I have only tried to
tell you how the rulebook is interpreted.  With over 102 classes there 
must be something for you other than full modified.

Yes swapping engines puts you in a different class (i.e. to keep the other
guy from having to do the same swap to keep up with you).  Do your
homework and look into whether there may have been an option for 16" 
wheels on the 911SC's ('78 on) or the '75 Carrera.  If so, then you could
run with them in one of their classes (but be careful about the
update/backdate rule when you start beating people in that class).  I
don't know all the U.S.  options that came on 911's.  I was just trying to

So any wheel bigger than 6"x15" is going to put my car in an "oversize 
wheel" class?  So by upgrading a broken 2.7 l engine to a 3.0l engine 
since I can't afford rebuilds every 50K on a 2.7, I have to go up against 
full race cars with massive expensive modifications?

There's something wrong here, since in the PCA GGR rules, it mentions 
something about these classes being setup for those who "don't" want to 
go to race engines, tires, suspension.  Am I missing something here, or 
do these rules leave a little something to be desired?

What about a basic points system like this:

You add a bigger than stock engine, you take xx number of points for 
stock class as compared by stock lbs/hp.

You add to that x points per .10 liter of engine increase, and x points 
per cm of tire (width only), and x points for racing:

shocks, brakes, whatever.

Now these values of x should be relative to the effect they are going to 
benefit the car over stock, and conceivably could be negative.

Oh hell, this is too complex for someone like Pete A. to comprehend... 
forget, we'll do it the dumb easy way...

and_
I've only been on the Porschephiles mailing list a few days, but I can see
that there is a tremendous amount of Porsche knowledge out there.  
Hopefully, someone can help solve some of the problems with my 944 Turbo.  
Problem 1: The rattle.  I have a rattle that comes from the right rear area. 
First I thought it might be the right rear speaker magnet hitting the inside
of the fender well, but I checked and it wasn't.  I suspect the fuel tank
filler neck but I have not been able to confirm this.  Is this rattle a
common occurrence? What is the fix? How do I get to the filler neck? From
inside, underneath, or through the filler door?
Problem 2:  The creak.  I have a creak that comes from the back in general. 
I suspect it may be the way the glass hatch attaches to the hardware.  Is
this common and is there a cure?
Problem 3:  The wind noise.  The sun roof makes a lot of wind noise when it
is closed.  It appears that the weather stripping does not allow the top to
close completely flush.  Any suggestions?

Hope to have it back together within a couple of weeks :-)

Subject: Re: Porsches in TV & movies


The Porsche was a familiar icon to those lucky enough
to have been able to watch Capital City. This was a 
hugely amusing series on UK television, screening around
1986/1987. Capital City concerned the lives, loves and
ambitions of City types, back when power-shoulders, ripping
peoples faces off and Porsche were fashionable. The 
archetypical Porsche was a battered 911 SC with one of
the doors held shut with string.

I'm nostalgic for that sort of thing, Porsche, Armani suits,
huge bonuses, biting the ass off of bears, and I'm trapped in
the age of peace and love. Damn. Whatever happened to greed?

                      911: Brakes-bleeder, caliper failure #000#        08-31-94

1)  I have the same problems with the MityvacII pump leaking.  I'm going to
give it one more try, but so far I think that it is a piece of junk,  but too
messy with brake fluid and grease to return to Automotion now.  Please reply
if you know how to make it work right.

2)  I bought a piece of tubing with a one-way check valve on it called a
one-man bleeder for $5 at Kragen and it worked great.  You can see the
bubbles in the tubing and just pump the brakes until they go away.

3)  Just thought I'd pass this along as it was one symptom of impending brake
system failure:  

About two weeks ago I posted a couple messages about rebuilding my brakes. I
had to rebuild the right rear caliper because the piston seals gave out.  The
symptom was an intermittently spongy pedal and if I remember right, pulling
to one side when braking.  I was stopped and started pushing hard on the
pedal repeatedly to see if they would pump up and all of a sudden the pedal
was going to the floor.  Luckily I was stopped when the seal failed.  I got
out and there was a big puddle of brake fluid at the right rear tire.  It
hadn't leaked from the hose or the bleeder nipple so I correctly diagnosed
the caliper, as the car stops quickly without pulling now and no leaks.  If
you have other symptoms please relay them to me and/or the list.  It makes me
feel better to have a little advance warning that one of my many 23 year-old
parts may be ready to go. 

4)  While you're at it, are there any symptoms of impending chain tensioner
failure that I can watch out for?

Subject: Monthly Message to the Subscribers

September 1994

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

Well, it's been an interesting month... I'm in the middle of starting
another company, and it's about to beat me to death. Once we get all
the moving parts to slow down a bit, I'll be sure to post the press
release announcing it to this list. You'll all be amused, I'm sure.

My daily driver is now the 356SC, the 911 having been moved to the 
warehouse only leaving to be shown to prospective buyers now that it's 
all polished and waxed (it was doing good to be washed monthly as a daily
driver...).  Driving a 30 year old car every day, particularly in Houston 
in the middle of the summer when you're having to also do the suit-and-tie 
thing, is a real experience. Still, wouldn't trade it for something else.

And life goes on. My condolances and thoughts are with list member
Bart Chambers in the recent loss of his best buddy Spike, as I've
seen is the case with a good many of you out there.

COPYRIGHT AND FAIR USAGE STATEMENT

The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence by and between
members of a closed community. As such, the copyright for EVERYTHING that 
ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 18 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

FINAL NOTE: As I noted in a prior mailing, the FTP restriction above applies 
to major downloading of stuff from the archives, not WWW access. Suggestions 
for improving the WWW pages would be welcomed, as well as experienced help
in doing so.

CLUB-INFO

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, PLEASE join!!

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070..

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Subject: Re: Need advice of high performance chip for 964. 

    Kevin,
 
    Thank you for your kind replying.   I'm grad to have an answer of my 
    question by porschephiles. Thank you very much.

    Well,  ANDIAL is familiar to many PORSCHE owners in JAPAN. ANDIAL is 
    the most famous dealer and maker of high performance parts in United 
    States, isn't it?

    But there is no advertisement of Andial in JAPAN.  Why? I don't know.
    Only in one PORSCHE magazine I had seen it. But there was no chip in 
    it. So I thought that Andial does not sell the chip.

    There are two kind of the high performance chips that I've ever know, 
    they are AUTOMOTION's and PERFORMANCE's.    The AUTOMOTION's chip is 
    with the data of the increasing horse power (about 18ps up, I think) 
    but the PERFORMANCE's chip is not.    And AUTOMOTION is cheaper than 
    PERFORMANCE, So I'm interested in it.

    Before talking which one I'd better buy, let me ask you some points.

           1. Are there no damage to the nomal engine?
           2. Is the emission control wrong?
           3. Only about 20ps up, can I feel it?
           4. I don't want to change the exaust system. Is it ok?

    So let me know about the ANDIAL's chip.

           1. How much power up is it?
           2. Price
           3. If you try, how was feel?


    Thanks,

Hi P-philers,

I'm off the list for a while due to travel and a high volume
of monster graphic communication that eats up my allotted
disk space any given day - so please reply directly if you're
interested.

For Sale:  asking $150 for shop and parts manuals

    911 2-volume Porsche shop manual covering through 1973
    (red vinyl ring binders)

    1973 Parts Manual (the kind used at the parts counter)
    with soft cover - this is a great reference manual for
    rebuild work 

also: MSD 6-series electronic ignition and high performance coil.
      Never used, although I tried and couldn't get it to work with
      the RPM sensor on my MFI. Others have done it, but I gave up.
      $50 (missing a few electrical spade connectors that can be
      picked up at your local store)

also: Crow's foot socket and cam holder for removing big cam nut and
      doing cam timing.  $50 for both

Buyer pays Fed-X or UPS charges.

This custom goes back a lot further than the heyday of the 2002.  In the
United States, it used to be common among sports car aficionados in the
Fifties, I understand.  

As an aside, I've heard that many drivers of Porsche 356s and 911/912s
refused to return the flashes of 914 drivers when the latter car first
came out.  Apparently Porsche owners were among the last hold-outs of the
custom, until their cars became so commonplace.

This is true, but the 914's were "blackballed" because 356 and 911/912
drivers didn't consider them "real" Porsches -- they used a VW engine, and
(reportedly) were sold as VW's in Europe.  The flashing custom persisted
for many years after the 914's introduction -- until Porsches became a
yuppy-scum trademark.

Subject: Importing a Porsche from USA to Europe



Hello everbody !


I would like to have some advertises on how to import a Porsche (early or mid 80's
 928S) from the USA to Europe (more precisely to France) because they still are
too expensive here ($20000 for a plain one, $30000 if in good condition and 911
are more expensive, whatever they look like ).

Does anyone have already did it ? Or knows someone who did ?

What is a `normal' price for a 928S '85 with less that 90 kmiles in a good
condition ?

I read that dispite the fact that 928S are 300-310 hp in Europe, they were less
powerfull for the US versions ?

Are US 928S mostly with manual gear box ?

How many speed for the automatic gear box ? Reliable ones ?

To get a number plate in France, a car should be respect some *stricts* rules.

If the seat-belts are fastened on the door, they must be changed.
Headlights too (front and rear).

For example, you don't need to change your windows and your wind screen if there
a simple mark on it: the letter `E' followed by a number (usually from 1 to 6) in
a small circle. Otherwise, you must change them ALL.

Do US 928s have those marks ?

Do they also have external driving-mirrors than can rotate ? (manually, to
protect pedestrians)


Thanks for repling.

I've been wondering about the "kick-back" that is present in the 911's 
steering; I understand the difference between it and "bump steer", and while 
there are fixes for the latter (as discussed in this list recently) I would 
like to know if anyone has considered the kick-back problem, due to the 
large scrub radius built into the front suspension.

The newer models (993, Carrera 4) have improved geometry and power steering; 
can this be adapted to the older models? Swapping the front suspension would 
be too expensive (and probably not practical), but perhaps the power 
steering?

I am speaking nonsense? I don't hear anyone complaining about the steering 
on new 993's, and the water pumpers seem to get along with it; going back 
through 911 magazine reviews I see notes on how power steering was not 
needed and would "ruin" the feel, and others on much better the new setup 
is...

My girlfriend had one on her '87 951.

She had a factory chip.  It was supposed to be good for about 
35 hp.

I never got a chance to compare the two, but her report was that
the boost came on a little sooner and there was more of it.

The car certainly was fast, once the turbo had spooled up.

Tracy,

I think the fuel pump only runs while cranking and while engine is
running.  I dont believe it runs while the key is in the ON position
with engine not running (for safety reasons).

Bad points can cause this, but it might just be a loose tach. North

Subject: 914 Fuel Injection(?) problems


        I'm a recently joined member of PorschePhiles and this is my first 
     letter. Unfortunately, it's of the variety of which I'd rather not be 
     writing. I have a problem which I hope someone out there can help 
     with.
        I have a 71' 914 which I recently started driving again after 2 
     years of down time. The car is stock mechanically (i.e.: 1.7L w/ 
     D-Jetronic Injection). I had a major service performed on the car 
     before taking it back out. 
        The first 250 or so miles, the car ran great. It used a little more 
     gas than I remembered, but not enough to alarm me considering that 
     about half the tank was old gas. Once during this time, for about 2-3 
     minutes, the car had lost power, not wanting to turn above 3k RPM. At 
     the end of the 2-3 minutes it let out a cloud of white smoke and 
     recovered. Again, I attributed this to the gas. 
        I then refilled the tank and drove about 50 miles when the incident 
     repeated itself. The next day the symptoms started again but would not 
     go away. This time the car spewed white smoke(which smelled of gas) 
     the entire time. I also notice at this time that I was very low on gas 
     after having just filled the tank less than 100 miles ago.
        I pulled over and took a look at the engine and found that the oil 
     was being diluted with gas. It had also filled the filter with the 
     mixture via the oil breather hose. All four cylinders are firing and 
     the car will sit and idle (sometimes a little high, sometimes with a 
     800 to 1500 lope to it), but after being under load for a minute of 
     two the problems start again. I ended up shutting the car down and 
     bringing it home on a trailer.
        I'm not a F.I. guru, but the closest thing I can pin it to is the 
     pressure sensor. From what I've read, a sensor failure would cause 
     most of the problems I've experienced. The gas in the oil still has me 
     stumped though. If the sensor wasn't working, could it cause the 
     injectors to send so much fuel that it would run down the piston walls 
     and into the case, yet not flood the engine enough to stall it?  Is 
     this a second problem (the only place I can see fuel is capable of 
     entering the engine is at the injectors and the cold start valve) or 
     am I off line and it's another problem altogether. Help!! I can't 
     afford to replace components at semi-random!

My '84 has several rattles and creaks.  Rubber bushings dry out and fasteners
come loose.  It is difficult to keep anything but a new car rattle free.

Regarding #1, dunno.

For #2, take the car to a reputable body shop (one that knows Porsches),
and have them look at the rear hatch.  The glass separating from the hatch
frame is a common occurance and could cause that noise.  It would need
to be re-glued with the proper adhesive/sealer.

#3. My sunroof doesn't quite close flush either, although I don't notice an
abnormal amount of wind noise.  This could be the seals, or it could be
that the stop point settings on the raising mechanism need adjustment.
Not having done it myself, I don't know how involved it would be.

Hope this was of some help,

 9/1/94        7:44 AM        Subject:    RE: Tires in the SF Bay area
After a fairly thorough search I ended up getting advice and buying tires
from Roger Krause Racing in Hayward.  When I acquired my 86 951 it had
non-stock wheels with Goodyear tires on the back, Goodrich tires on the
front.  The car handled poorly in a straight line.  It would pull sharply to
either side if the pavement was rough (is this bump steer?), or sometimes
during braking.  To me it felt like the front end was toe out.   I had a 4
wheel alignment done but it didn't change.  The people that did the alignment
suggested that it might be the tires.  I didn't think it could be because the
problem was fairly severe.  I was concerned that it may have the wrong wheels
on the car, too wide with the wrong offset.  The tires would rub during hard
cornering.  The wheels were 8" wide BBS on the front, and 10.5" wide on the
rear.  I talked to several wheel and tire shops in the Bay area that should
have known whether I had the correct wheels or not, but I could not get
consistent answers.  They were all happy to offer to sell me new wheels with
tires.  So I asked several Porsche owners and shops (this is before I knew
about Porschephiles) where they go and who they could recommend.  Roger
Krause Racing was the most mentioned name.  After I went there, Roger Krause
(the owner) took one look at my wheels and said that they where fine.  After
a lengthy discussion, in which he described the characteristics, advantages,
and disadvantages of all the major brands (all of which he carried) he
recommended and I bought the Toyo F-1.   That was almost 2 years ago and I
have been very pleased.  The handling problem was instantly gone, no more
tire rubbing, and the tires work great.
This answer is a bit long, but I though that the additional information might
be useful.

Subject: Twin-plug ignition

Hello everybody,

A friend asked a question of me today which I didn't have the answer to and,
quite frankly, had never thought of: Do both plugs for each cylinder in a
dual-plug 911 engine fire simultaneously or do they follow a primary/trail
timing scheme?

This will be important to know when I dual-plug my '74.

While we're on the subject of twin-plug ignitions, from the C2 on I
think the factory actually used two distributors. The first twin-plug cars
used a Magnetti-Marelli distributor, but I know a Bosch twin-plug
distributor is available and is preferred over the Marelli. Any comments
or opinions on each of these methods?

Thanks,

Just to let you know of one possible source - the rear bumper shocks. 

I too was mystified by a rattle coming from the rear on my '89. As sort of a 
last resort I grabbed the bumper and gave it an up and down shake.  There's
apparently enough play in my shocks to permit the shafts to knock against the
housings.  Being hard mounted to the frame merely amplifies it . . . ie, the
rattle.

>Problem 2:  The creak.  I have a creak that comes from the back in general. 
>I suspect it may be the way the glass hatch attaches to the hardware.  Is

I would agree with your suspicions.  Personally, I live with it. One obvious
recommendation to 924/944 owners - close your hatch by pulling down on the
central segment of the spoiler (or the glass if you ain't got the spoiler) or,
better yet, use both hands symmetrically located off center, more towards the 
edges.  Closing the lid by pulling down on the spoiler at (or close to) either 
end puts a nice torque on the lid that I am sure instigates and then aggravates 
glass separation from the frame and hence the creaking problem.

>Problem 3:  The wind noise.  The sun roof makes a lot of wind noise when it

First check to see that the weather stripping is properly installed - it 
might not be adequately seated around the perimeter of the sun roof. Actually,
it should be fairly obvious if its not.  You could also have something trapped
or wedged in the gutter preventing the roof from closing completely.  Of course,
the roof could be out of adjustment or you may need to simply replace the 
weather stripping.

With the same model (1986 951) I had creaks, rattles and clucks coming from
the same areas. Drove me crazy. Had wife drive - sat in back seat - still
couldn't determine source although I suspected the two rear hatch
shocks-lifters (or whatever they're called). Car, at the time I bought it (3
years ago) had only 12,000 miles, very little sun-time, and condition of
rear glass and hatch seemed very good. So I had no reason to suspect
separation.

I eliminated the strange sounds by smearing clear, silicone gel lubricating
compound on the two bayonets, their recepticals, and around the rubber seals
and mating surfaces, and by also spraying silicone (aerosol can) into the
two hinges. Voila - silence!

Hope this might work for you.

>-darryl


Darryl,

   Most problems with "engine noise" in a stereo are due to a problem referred 
to as a ground-loop.  The problem can show up on the AM radio and in more 
serious cases will be present on FM or even when playing CD's or tapes.

   Basically, the way most cars are built, positive voltage is supplied to all 
the various components by individual wires.  However the grounding of all those 
components is done by the metal chassis of the car. (It takes 50% less wire this 
way...) It also explains why the negative side of your battery is connected 
directly to the metal chassis with a strap.  The problem is that for each 
circuit that needs to return voltage to the battery, there are literally 
thousands (millions?) of possible ways for that voltage to travel through the 
metal surfaces of your car and back to the negative side of the battery.  Your 
alternator (which charges the battery) is a source of enormous amounts of 
electrical noise, and since it's connected to the same ground source as 
everything else, it is possible to pick up that interference in other sources.  
In your case this happens to be the stereo system.  The problem is worsened when 
different components in the stereo system have grounding points located in all 
different places in the car.  (Using factory grounding points doesn't guarantee 
a "noise-free" system either)  By the way, the explanation about these 
electrical relationships could fill a book.  I'm not an expert on this topic, 
but I am an audio enthusiast, and I've learned a lot from reasearch and even 
more by doing it the "hard way" (An 1100W system reveals engine noise really 
well...) 
Here are some tips:

1.  Find a new location for the ground wire on your deck.  (Contrary to first 
impulse, running a wire all the way to the negative side of the battery will NOT 
help.  In fact, it will probably make the noise worse)  There are probably lots 
of metal tabs under the dash that you could attach to.  Make sure the metal is 
clean for good wire contact.  Sometimes moving the ground point even a few 
_inches_ can help provide a "cleaner" sound. (Really!)

2.  If you have seperate amps or crossovers, consolidate those ground wires with 
the one from the deck.  Removing the differences in "ground potential" on these 
various components will surely help.

3.  If you have seperate amps, make sure that you run the signal wires (RCA 
cables) far away from the power and ground wires.  Strong electrical currents in 
these wires will induce noise in the signal wires, which will cause noise too.

4.  As a last resort, there are filters available to get rid of engine noise.  
Most serious enthusiasts frown on these, as they degrade the sound quality of 
the stereo.  If you need one of these, it is an indication of a grounding 
problem somewhere else in your system.  You make the call...

Hope this helps.

     be a lever on or even under the dash that activates it.  There is 
     should be an electric fuel pump that delivers gas from your gas tank

Of all places, COSTCO in Mountain View did good job on my car.  Set of 
205/55/16 and 225/50/16 tires mounted and ballanced was around 
$535  (Yoko A403's).

The firestone dealer at El Camino and Saratoga-Sunnyvale scratched one 
of my wheels removing a wheel weight.

I take mail order tires to the firestone dealer on San Antonio in Mt.Vw.
because they will mount/ballance for $10/wheel if you are a pca member
or a competitive driver (scca/ncssc auto-x or rr).

The "tire rack" generally has the best mail order prices when you inlcude 
shipping - be sure they ship from RENO ($5/tire instead of $10).

The keyword here is "European Tire Machine."  This is the beast that doesn't
scratch the wheels.

Subject: accidents

Greetings fellow Porschephiles,

I just "discovered" this group, today.

I have been browsing through the archives and I noticed one thing that seems to be
constant advice and that is to stay away from Porsches that have been in car wrecks when
considering a used buy.

My question to you is: why does this have to be?  

I own a 1986 Carrera Targa which I take care of (like the rest of us) better than myself.
Unfortunately last year some idiot nudged it lightly in the rear at highway speed causing
me to spin out and slide under a guard rail with the rear.

After the accident, I spent about a month personally researching several body shops that 
specialized in Porsche body work.  Personally interviewed the owners.  Personally visited
their references and their handiwork.

After picking the right body shop,  I then spent the next four months (Insurance delays played a
big part in that) actively working with the shop owner making sure that all parts were original,
that no bondo was used (I had them replace the right rear quarter rather then bondo it).

We went over the paint process with a fine-tooth comb in order to match it to the rest of the
car to a "T".  Yes, it's guards red.  Of course, before we started all this we went over the frame
and there wasn't the slightest bend to it.

Anyhow,  to make a long story short,  after the work was completed, I took the car to three 
different Porsche dealers, lied and told them that I was interested in buying the car
and to check it over, partcularly I asked them if, in their opinion, the car was ever hit.

All three of them were absolutely sure that my car was never hit (Did my bodyshop do a great job
or what?).

Anyhow,  why should people stay away from formerly hit cars if the repair was done in a 
professional, very close to spec manner.  If nobody would buy my car, even though it looks 
and runs brand new, what am I supposed to do, give it away or throw it away?  Wouldn't that 
force me to lie and tell the prospective buyer that my car was never hit (since three Porsche
dealers could not see where the repairs were made)?

Thanks for any input you can give me.

Please reply me at jpirrott@wellfleet.com so we won't bog down the system here.

Cordially,

Joe Pirrotta

	While this has nothing to do with Frank's problem, His post reminded me
of a British car I owned before I saw he light and converted to Porsches. The
car was a '74 Jensen-Healey convertable which was powered by a Lotus motor
mounted on its side. Fuel system included Dual Stromberg CD side draught
carbs. These carbs were a work of art with the fuel flow regulated by a needle
valve which was controlled by a rubber diapharam which sensed manifold pressure.
a small oil-damped dashpot above the carb prevented the needles from "fluttering"
this dashpot always leaked, no matter how many times i rebuilt the carbs. Normal
procedure was to refill the oil dampers when I got gas. Just unscrew the tops and
add oil to the carbs. That gets lots of comments -definitely a british thing to do...

	One time, I let the dashpot run dry and the result was a stuck needle in one
of the carbs. This caused the carb to flood. The fuel ran out the carb, into the
air cleaner, down the air cleaner, into the valve cover breather line, down the valve

Why not get one from Germany??? I've seen German 928S's (1985) advertised
at DM27k = (approx. $18k) with 100k kilometres (60k miles) on the clock.

If you want a 911 they cost from DM33k and up for '84 - '86 models in
good condition!

Then you don't have to change a US-spec car back to Euro-spec and pay
a (probably) expensive freight over the ocean.

Try buing the german magazine Auto, Motor und Sport and check out the
price yourself.

I have a similar symptom in my '72 911.  Sometimes when I brake, I get a
pulling, but its more like the car is rotating, you'd have to feel it
to understand.  Its like a directional change along the longitudinal axis,
and when you let off the brake, it rotates back.  You get a directional 
change, but no pull in the steering wheel.

I've been meaning to check it, but I've been to busy with school and moving
to take the time.

Any ideas?

It is basically the same as street driving, but things wear out faster and
must be in better shape before even driving in competition. Don't test a
marginal part under race driving. It WILL break. If you drive and shift
smoothly, your car should not be harmed.

I think air gets in around the bleeder nipple threads if you do it this way,
when you let up on the brake pedal. You really need to tighten the bleeder
when the pedal is down, then let it come up, push, crack it open again, and
repeat this procedure for perfect bleeding. This is especially true on our
old cars, where the vaccuum type bleeder won't work for the same reason (air
goes through the threads).

A good alignment to competition specs will make your car handle much better.
This includes lowering, Negative Camber, toe setting, and maximum front
caster.
The only difference in the S is the sway bars and shocks, what you have
should be good enough (although a 19mm front bar would be even better). The
rear bar is not so important, and neither are the front shocks as long as
they are working properly. The 14" tires may be legal, but are not the hot
setup. Get some 15 by 6" Fuchs alloys (should be rea$onable) and some 60
series (205/60/15) tires. Even on the street you will be amazed at the
difference in handling. The ride won't be much worse either. The 14" wheels
were only available on the 911 E (I think) as part of a comfort package,
although they may have come on some T models. I had a chance to drive a T
with no swaybars on a lumpy Connecticut back road a few years back. It was
wonderful how the suspension could follow the road without the sway bars
taking out the compliance. But too much body lean for maximum cornering
force.

Sigh.... A gas heater is a mini-pulse jet engine running in a can, in
the "illegal drug compartment" under the front hood of the 911/912. It
provides a heat source for heating the air inside the car. The "default"
heat source on the air-cooled Porsches is the heat exchangers, which
pretty much suck on the 356s and 912s (lots of smelly engine smells
along with the warm air). Hence the gas heater for those with sensitive
noses...

I am certainly no expert, but my opinion is that people are most leery
of cars that have been hit when the seller doesn't tell them or denies
it. Clearly the ethical thing to do is to tell the buyer exactly what
was damaged and let him or her see that it was properly repaired. Of
course, ethics and car sales are not closely related, but you could be
one of the first...

On the other hand, if you were selling to a dealer, I don't know. It is
already an uneven match, and giving them any more information than

Any experience with cooling fans for 911? I have the terbatrol cooler in

nearly 120C. I'd really like to stick to stock body configuration, which

Not having any specific information re:2.2Ls, I'd day if the engine is
apart then do it.  I've heard (or read in Bruces book?) that disturbing
the engine can cause them to bust when you put them back in.  I paid
$313 for 24 new black epoxy coated dilavar studs.  I think you'll probably
need timesert inserts too.  I found vertex had the best price on these,
$14 for a bag of 24 (I think you have a mag case, n'est pas ?).  For about
$500 (assuming $200 to get someone to remove the old ones, put in the new
ones to the correct height) it's DEFINATELY something I'd do.

The pressure fed tens. are the best.  You can tell you have these if there
is an additional fitting at the midpoint of the oil line to the cam oiler
with a thin oil line which goes to a bolt in the front face of the chain
tensioner covers.  The second best are the mechanical tensioners from
911 SC's (78-83 I think, check with someone else).  These need to be
replaced every 40-60k miles (remembered from some source or other),
the incremental cost to get pressure tens over new mechanical ones is about
$170 I think.  Do this !

  >you mean for the oil lines for the tensioners?
In particular yes, but these are O rings all over the engine.  Ones that
come to mind are: tensioner seals(above), in-block oil t-stat, distributer,
intermediate chaft, oil cooler, oil return tubes.

OK, the way the tensioner works is that the tensioner pushes agaist one
end of a lever which pivots around a stud through the chain housing.  On
the other end of the lever is a sprocket which is what actually pushes
against the chain to keep it tight.  This level/sprocket is the idler arm.
There are (at least) two types a narrow one and a wider one.  One part
of the tensioner slips over the same post as this arm, in order for the
tensioner to be in the correct position it must be bearing against the
ider arm on the post too.  I think there may be spacers to accomodate
narrow arms, not sure though (list guys ?)

I've been trying hard to ignore the thread on gas heaters,

the "60's I had to drive a '57 Beetle around in Alaska in
the winter. It had the old style gas heater and of course
it didn't work...ever. If it was -25F outside, it was -45F
inside; I usually iced up before the car did.

Yet in Minot, ND, the new 1971 VW bus we had had a newer type
that worked great. Damn near parbroiled the dog once. Only
trouble with it was that when set on high, it used almost as 
much gas as the engine.

Thank you all for your indulgence. This little catharsis will

Strange choice of words. Porsche folklore is that they tend to do that --
explode. I don't know, I don't have any firsthand knowledge, and I kind of
wish I had one in my car, but the word is that even concours cars have a
nice shiny heater but never turn it on. It's basically a gas bomb in there
- -- takes gasoline, burns it in a combustor can, makes lots of hot air. It's
used to heat the interior RIGHT NOW; now more waiting a half hour for the
air-cooled engine to warm up.
 
There are a few companies scattered around the country that can work on
them. The same system was used in VWs and is still used in light aircraft
(often called a "Southwind heater.") Yours is probably made by Webasto.

Subject: Warm gas

NO.  RESIST!  English has been used for sarcasm, for irony, for satire, for
hundreds of years before the invention of the emoticon.  I thought Bauman's
piece about a gas warmer was terrific, and played perfectly to the tone of the
message he was answering.  I tried to think of a topper, about a gas cooler
routing fuel through the 928's airconditioned glove box, but Jim had really
used up all the joke there was.  Excellent.

Please don't give up on the written word.  Internet groups of literate people
who share interests can be such a pleasure, and a real force against the
insta-culture of MTV and "give us 10 minutes, we'll give you the world" news.
An emoticon in this context is a sign of disrespect for your correspondent.

"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?  ;-)"

We're out here.  We're reading and enjoying.  We know that "its" and "it's"
are two different words with different uses.  We're laughing out loud when
someone gets in a good shot.  We're logging to file when we see good hints and
new information.  And we don't need a smiley face to know what's funny.

The Bergman stuff is *4 cylinder* specific. Not enough flow or heat
sink capacity for the dry sump 911 system.

The fan thing is a good idea. So good, in fact, that the factory uses
it on late Carreras. All you gotta do is find the rights parts in a 
salvage yard, or buy them new.

What, you have too much money, is that it??? Price the necessary
Aeroquip parts before you think about that. We don't even use
braided steel lines everywhere on the race cars. And oh yeah -- 
you'll need the special 30mm to AN adapters for all the oil stuff. 
I know Pegasus has them.

>-darryl

- --------------------

Darryl,

   Most problems with "engine noise" in a stereo are due to a problem referred 
to as a ground-loop.  The problem can show up on the AM radio and in more 
serious cases will be present on FM or even when playing CD's or tapes.

   Basically, the way most cars are built, positive voltage is supplied to all 
the various components by individual wires.  However the grounding of all those 
components is done by the metal chassis of the car. (It takes 50% less wire this 
way...) It also explains why the negative side of your battery is connected 
directly to the metal chassis with a strap.  The problem is that for each 
circuit that needs to return voltage to the battery, there are literally 
thousands (millions?) of possible ways for that voltage to travel through the 
metal surfaces of your car and back to the negative side of the battery.  Your 
alternator (which charges the battery) is a source of enormous amounts of 
electrical noise, and since it's connected to the same ground source as 
everything else, it is possible to pick up that interference in other sources.  
In your case this happens to be the stereo system.  The problem is worsened when 
different components in the stereo system have grounding points located in all 
different places in the car.  (Using factory grounding points doesn't guarantee 
a "noise-free" system either)  By the way, the explanation about these 
electrical relationships could fill a book.  I'm not an expert on this topic, 
but I am an audio enthusiast, and I've learned a lot from reasearch and even 
more by doing it the "hard way" (An 1100W system reveals engine noise really 
well...) 

Here are some tips:

1.  Find a new location for the ground wire on your deck.  (Contrary to first 
impulse, running a wire all the way to the negative side of the battery will NOT 
help.  In fact, it will probably make the noise worse)  There are probably lots 
of metal tabs under the dash that you could attach to.  Make sure the metal is 
clean for good wire contact.  Sometimes moving the ground point even a few 
_inches_ can help provide a "cleaner" sound. (Really!)

2.  If you have seperate amps or crossovers, consolidate those ground wires with 
the one from the deck.  Removing the differences in "ground potential" on these 
various components will surely help.

3.  If you have seperate amps, make sure that you run the signal wires (RCA 
cables) far away from the power and ground wires.  Strong electrical currents in 
these wires will induce noise in the signal wires, which will cause noise too.

4.  As a last resort, there are filters available to get rid of engine noise.  
Most serious enthusiasts frown on these, as they degrade the sound quality of 
the stereo.  If you need one of these, it is an indication of a grounding 
problem somewhere else in your system.  You make the call...

Hope this helps.

A friend is considering purchasing an Autopower Bolt In Roll Cage for 
his 914.

What is the net-wisdom about such a thing:

1) Is there a better solution in the same price range (his price will be    
   about $500)?

2) How difficult is the installation?

3) Any negative experiences with this particular brand?  Positives           
   experiences?

I'll watch for your comments and feed them back to him.

Thanks Stan,
        I knew there was a reason I wanted to ask the experts about this 8^)
and no, I do not have way too much money (do any of us?).  I just happen
to have a very good fiend who works in the pits at Sears Point and has 
access to all the materials I need to do this.  I can get most for cost.
        But anyway, to do this all OEM, I need a supplier of the fuel lines
with fittings, as mine are all trash.  Anybody?

Subject: 914 Brake Bleeding Questions


Can someone point me in the right direction for a good, detailed
description of what it takes to bleed (and adjust) the brakes on a 914-4
for the firmest possible pedal?

My setup:

        Stock calipers (rebuilt front, new rear)
        Drilled rotors front and rear (Troutman)
        SS lines front and rear (Troutman)
        Ferodo AF pads front and rear
        Stock proportioning valve
        Castrol LMA (changed yearly)

I have two complaints (well, three, seeing that I'm complaining to begin with):

 1) There's too much distance (for my taste) between the dead zone of the
brake pedal (after the first 20mm) and before the brakes really start to
grab.

 2) Once the pedal firms up, there's a zone past it where it feels like I'm
pushing on a stiff spring, and of course I can hear that very spring/piston
moving in the proportioning valve when all is quiet.

What really frustrates me is that I have all-ATE brakes of a very similar
nature on a BMW and three ALFAs, and their brake pedals are rock-hard and
the brakes are very responsive (they all have SS lines also).

My questions are:

 1) Is the stock 914-4 brake pedal situation hopeless? If not, why not? 

 2) If so, what can be done? I do _not_ want to switch to 5-bolt fronts and
rears, though I would consider switching front calipers. Yesterday I saw a
914-4 with pretty big front calipers (with a stylized "S" in a circle) on
standard hubs/rotors and wheels. Who makes these? They weren't Bremtek,
Brembo, JFZ or AP as far as I could tell ...

Thanks

Andrew (a Porschefiles newbie)

Subject: 914 alignment setting

Can any one give me the specs for aligning a 914 for autocrossing.  The car
has 140 lbs springs in the back, but otherwise is stock height.  The right
rear wheel has lots of negative camber (as if the suspension console is
broken, but it is not).  My mechanic is reluctant to try to align it becasue
he believes the bolts which needed to be removed to add shims may be too
frozen with rust to remove.  Any suggestions welcomed.

PS I have been reluctant to take the car to the dealer because I am not sure
whether the young mechanics there will know enough about a 1973 914.  In any
case, I am reluctant to write the dealership a blank check to allow them to
break something and take a week to fix it.

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

=======================================================================

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

=======================================================================

Who is the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          President, NetSmiths, Ltd.
          2025 Lincoln Highway
          Edison, NJ 08817

          '64 356 SC (OK, so he fell in love again).

=======================================================================

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

=======================================================================

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  

=======================================================================

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available via FTP at tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/
Archives in five subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94) each of which has 
the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan
may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to mail you
archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY
mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program,
or equivalent, to restore to textual format.

=======================================================================

What else is available in the tta.com archives?

     FAQs: This FAQ; also specific FAQs about specific Porsche models
are being added (so far there's only one, for the 914--feel free to
contribute one on YOUR favorite Porsche).
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

=======================================================================
 
Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/Porschephiles/home.html.
The FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

=======================================================================

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions?  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts..."

     In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split.

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

Which clubs are there for Porsche owners?

     Several different clubs are available, depending on your interests
and location:

          Porsche Club of America.
          P.O. Box 10402

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
            1970.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914, 1976.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
            of the four-cylinder engine.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 as the 924S with the 944 drivetrain.
            Has the best aerodynamic shape of any Porsche.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the

            to 5.4 today.
     930  - Turbocharged 911, homologation and street version of the
            racing 934.

            nearly perfect 50/50 weight bias.  Sixteen-valve and
            turbocharged versions were produced.  Produced from 1982
            through 1991. 2.5 litre displacement, except for a 2.7 litre

     964  - Another name for the 911 Carrera 4 and Carrera 2 as introduced
            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, introduced in 4/94.

=======================================================================

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:
Information about water-cooled cars is lacking; those with favorites
should submit them to one of the names at the end of this FAQ.)

There are also Haynes manuals available for most models.  While the
Haynes manuals tend to be very weak on specifics having to do with
different model years and variations, they are good at teaching how-to
procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

=======================================================================

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other renowned Porsche people) here?
 
     Bruce was invited to join and did so back in '91. The load then
was too much for him.  All of what, 2k a day or so.  Now, at 15x to 20x
that load, he probably doesn't want back on.  He's not stupid -- he 
knows where we are.

     No specifics are available regarding other renowned Porsche people.
If they want to be known, they will announce their presence.  (Besides,
your definition of "renowned" may differ from mine.)

=======================================================================

Where can I get a copy of the latest version of this FAQ?

     The FAQ is stored on tta.com in the /pub/porschephiles/FAQs 
directory, filename general-FAQ.  The version stored there will be 
the same one sent out monthly.  (There's also a FAQ that's specific to
the 914; other specific FAQs are welcomed, if anyone wants to contribute
to the archives.)

=======================================================================

Who maintains this FAQ?

     The FAQ is maintained by Walt Thode (thode@nprdc.navy.mil).  I have
a 1972 911T as my daily driver.  Anyone who wants to contribute can do
so.  Contributions, revisions, and suggestions for new items are always
welcomed.  I peruse the list for potential additions, but don't be shy 
about sending suggestions directly to me.

Subject: Helmets

Your SNELL 85 should be OK for autocrossing and most drivers eds, but how
much is your head (or life) worth?

If you are buying a new helmet, Get a Snell SA90. The SA rating is required
for some regions' track events (Connecticut valley).
The "S"pecial "A"pplications rating is basically fire proofing for automobile
driving as opposed to motorcyles.

If you get an '85 it will soon (if not already) be outdated and not legal.
Get a full face helmet as an open helmet will not protect you if your belts
stretch or fail in a crash.

     Greeting fellow-Philers,
     
     Drove the "Lady in Red" into work today (she sure likes cool temps),
     anyway, does anyone know on the water temp guage, the normal running
     temperture should be on these cars?  Cool mornings about 1/4 marker,
     and in the afternoons about 1/2 marker (so long as were moving).  But
     obviously in stop-n-go traffic she runs much hotter with fans on.  She
     cools quickly though.  I know, I know, so what's the problem??  Well,
     I live around Sacramento (Yippee) And it's bloody hot here usually (about
     60 degrees by 6:30 am).  So, does my temp sound about right or should I
     look into alternate cooling options?  If you have any input, I'd really
     appreciate it!  Thanks!  Have a proud-Porsche-pavement-poundin' weekend!

This is all true, but ONLY if you're on the inside looking out. There was
some poor guy out there in this case that had *NO IDEA* what a gas heater
was, and apparently no clue that he could look in his owner's manual, or
in the service manual, or in some other reference to check it out. Or 
possibly, it was just easier to ask -- and while I though Jim's response
was hysterical myself, that didn't help the guy who asked the original 
question.

Humor is wonderful, but should not be used as a mechanism to keep us
from fulfilling our primary mission here: each of us helping the rest
enjoy these cars as much as WE do...

FWIW, 16 inch wheels are listed in the factory "Technical
Specifications" booklet for 76/77 911, Carrera 3.0 and Turbos
in the 6 and 7 inch wide flavors.

The magazine "Motor Sport" ran an article in February of 1977
which depicts a 1977 Turbo shod with 205/55-16 front tires/
225/50-16 rears on Fuchs alloys.  Looks like the factory did
offer these as an option, although only for Carrera 3.0s and
Turbos.  They don't fit very well on un-flared 911s.

Jerry,

In San Diego, and Zone 8 PCA events, we will begin to require 
Snell 90 starting on Jan. 1, 1995.  I've also heard that Snell 95
is expected out around June of 1995.  

I would suggest you get the 90 as it will be applicable longer.

First:  Porsche Movie Stars

OK Pete, you got this started.  Are you, or is someone else, going to 
compile and distribute all this great trivia?  p.s. my favorite was john 
hurt's targa in The Big Chill.  they fit together.

It's to heat the inside of the car.  it's much more effective that the basic 
heater for delivering heat.  I would think maintenance is important so you 
don't get an "exploded view" of the car!

Third:  Subject: Helmet Requirements (Jerry Mac)

Jerry, PCA will require at least a snell 85 for driving events beginning in 
1995 (slaloms, drivers school, etc.).  According to the helmet source here 
(Gemini racing) the snell 90 is much superior to the 85 rating and is the 
one to buy - - they recommend simpsons.  Don't know if that is gospel but I 
always figured buying the best helmet I could afford was cheaper than buying 
the best brain surgeon my insurance would afford.

Fourth:
As the good witch told Dorothy, close your eyes and keep repeating "there's 
no person like Ted, there's no person like Ted".

Oh, I'm not saying don't answer the guy's question (although "buy the car

A friend who's a porsche mechanic told me the following story:

Porsche's black era from 74-77, with the 2.7 liter, was largely
due to overheating problems that arose after increasingly restrictive 
smog regulations in California led to the installation of catalytic
converters. Many of the California Porsches during
this period cooked their engines, and Porsche had to replace MANY
engines under warranty for the first time ever. Finally in 1978
they reduced emissions enough via the use of oxygen sensors and
other improvements to the fuel injection system that they
were able to get rid of the catalytic converters, and as a result the
engines ran much cooler.  Meanwhile, another group at the factory had
put a lot of effort into improving the case alloy so it could withstand
more heat.  As a result, the 3.0 engine (1978 on) was extremely durable.

I submit this to the list since the books that I have are not
very critical of the Porsche factory, I will try to get a copy
of Anderson ASAP to see if it is better.

I think the car in 'Death Becomes Her' was James Dean's 550 Spyder, not an

experience with the Beck 550 Spyder replica?  I've caught glimpses of one 
here in Tucson, but have not been able to take a close look.

Sorry I missed this. I must disagree!
Unless the braided brake lines used are absolute crap, they are bound to be
better than rubber lines in several ways. The performance improvements
include a firmer pedel feel, quicker response, and more predictable
response. As stock rubber lines age (even Porsche lines) they begin to
swell and bulge when pressure is applied. This causes a soggey or soft
pedel, and a lag in response. The safety imporovement is a higher
resistance to abrasion or puncture. And then there's the cosmetic
improvement(not seen as often with brake lines as with oil and fuel lines.

If you don't mind spending the money and it's what you want to do, how
could it be a mistake?

>Stan says:

Stan doesn't seem to understand that these vehicles are out toys and we

>Price the necessary Aeroquip parts before you think about that.

I agree wholeheartedly. Know what its going to cost befor you jump in. I
have over $2,000 invested in braided stainless on my Chevy powered 914. Is
it worth it? Probably not, but it looks great and I don't worry about leaky
or broken lines.

Not absolutely true. Porsche is just as bottom-line oriented as GM. True,
they make a much more exciting product, but they also charge a more
exciting price. If they can save a buck here and there, they will.
Porsche's are great, but not perfect. Anything can be improved on.

Who certified Stan an expert?

What with the price of Porche OEM lines it might even be cheaper to do a
nice looking setup with braided stainless lines. Go for it, Tom!
