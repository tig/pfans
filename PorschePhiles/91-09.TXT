Have any dealers crashed? There have been many stories of "yuppies" etc. not buying Porsches in the UK, resulting in pictures of large storage areas full of unsold cars (mainly 944's) in the national press! God knows what they will do with these when the 968 is released in Autumn! Give one to me hopefully :-) :-)

I wouldn't say sad.  Porsche deserves what it is getting.  The genious
is clearly gone from the company, and you can only go so far on name and
reputation.  

It won't be long before Porsche is sold.  GM, Nissan, maybe Mercedes.

hear hear.  after years of pandering to the gold chain set, porsche
infuriated the rest of us by forsaking sports car racing and floundering
publicly and convincingly in single seat racing.

so now the gold chains have been seduced by the japanese and the rest
of us can't understand why porsche can't put some innovation and/or value
into their cars.

i've bought two porsches new, the second only because porsche was having
a fire sale on 951S's.  lately i've been thinking maybe i could get a
used 914 and have some fun with it...

saw a great T-shirt a few weeks ago.  it had a pictures of 904/906/914/917/etc
and was captioned "sure, porsche made some non-mid-engined cars ... but WHO
CARES?"

Well, unfortunately the minions at PCNA can only sell what PAG gives them to
sell.  So no matter how you feel about the direction the Board has taken since
Peter Schutz' departure, it is of course too bad that everyone else from
Stuttgart, to Reno, to your local dealership's part dept, and even to your local
PCA chapter, has to pay the piper.

My understanding continues to be that PAG is in no financial difficulty, and a
sale would only come about if the family (Porsche and Piech) decided to bail. 
(Remember that they hold 100% of the voting stock.)  My fear, what I really hate
to see happen, is that Porsche will become/is becoming a boutique company like
Ferrari and the other Italian firms.  Peter Porsche and/or Brian Bowler have
expressed the same concern, if memory serves.  What they are willing to do about
it really remains to be seen.

I'm optimistic about the 968.  It seems likely to be a much improved 944S2 for a
minimal price increase (two grand).  What that translates to in street price
remains, of course, to be seen.  But given that S2's are going for $35,000, we
could hope to see 968's available for $37,000.  Hope!

The 968 seems to be another stop-gap model, the 944 S2 with 928 styling front and rear, yet another extension of the original 924. I like the 944 S2 very much but I think that they have almost come to the end of the road with this car, mind you, I also think that the Carrera 2/4 should not have been released - Porsche deperately need some fresh styling/cars. 

I suppose it's possible that the 968 could evolve into a completely different car, Audi V6 planned in'93 I believe.

Have you seen the proposed 928 replacement, a 4 door expensive barge - yeuch!! They seem to be moving into large luxury GT/coupe market rather than their original smallish junior supercar market - shame!!

I wish I could buy a 944 S2 for $35,000 , in Switzerland (relatively cheap place for cars in Europe) they are about $50,000 and in the UK they are about $60,000+.  There must be some real secondhand bargains in the states!!

It's to bad for the real enthusiast, but, Porsche is getting what they
deserve. For years Porsche catered to the true enthusiast, with exciting
but slightly expensive automobiles. Today they cater to the gold-chain-
yupster-set with megadollar automobiles (928, 944) and very well-built
but outrageously expensive antique automobiles (911). Porsche will all
but disappear if they continue to ignore the true enthusiasts and follow
their present path "upmarket". The yupsters are bored and turning japanese.....

	I heartily agree with whoever remarked on the age of the 924
line. In its 15 years (or more?) it has been reworked, remodeled,
pumped-up, pumped-down, given facelifts, and butt-tucks, spawning along
the way the 928 and the 944. I admit it was a great design to start
out with but Porsche must realize that all the make-up and plastic
surgery in the world can't disguise the fact that the 924 design has
had its day - rehashing it in the 968 is, simply, poor form. An aging
woman trying desperately to stay young and attractive, and losing. A
911 this puppy is NOT.

Subject: Racing Dynamics stress bar
Message-Id: <41910905022714/0004056890NA1EM@mcimail.com>

Folks -

This is part field report, part inquiry for other people's experiences.  My
mechanic and I tried putting a Racing Dynamics stress bar (shock tower brace) in
my '87 944S today.  I choose this part reluctantly because it costs twice what
the Camber Truss equivalent does.  The reason was that I had seen one of the
Camber Trusses installed in another 944S, and its owner apparently had to grind
the bar pretty seriously to get it to clear the 944S' larger manifold.

OK, so there were four basic problems with the RD part:

1. The two flanges which share the shock bearing's bolts and fasten to same use
two bolts, not four like the Camber Truss.  Non-fatal, probably not even serious
according to my mechanic.

2. These aluminum parts were, in part, formed by bending part of them to a 90
degree angle.  The stress fractures were visible.  Non-fatal but schlocky. 
Aluminum is not a metal I consider primo for cold-working.

3. You cannot put the driver side piece on without either removing or relocating
the metal AC line.  Non-fatal.  My guy carefully reshaped the line in two places
and relocated the line down the tower a tad.  Adele clamp located to an usused
stud which happens to be handy, speed nut applied.  The vacuum equipment there
also gets moved a bit.

4. The flanges are too thick to fully thread the nuts on the towers' shock
bearing bolts.  Fatal error.  Repack the mess.

Turned out my mechanic had a Camber Truss waiting for a customer.  Invoking the
Autocross War Powers Emergency Act, I impounded it and we put it on.  Turned out
that no grinding was necessary, there was some adjustment play in the device and
it was possible to fiddle it so that neither the hood nor the manifold was
rubbed.  Crayon marks at key points and a test drive verified this.

Has anyone else tried the Racing Dynamics part, and what experiences have they
had?  For 300 smackers, double the competition, I would expect better.

Kevin

Ooops... complete brain fade, long day in the office.  There was another reason
we repacked the RD stress bar kit.  It interfered with the brake proportioning
valve on the master cylinder.  Not a little bit, a lot.  Very strange.  Fatal.

I'm insulted. My 11 year old ZR1-eating outrageously expensive antique
automobile wants to defend its honor against anything you can muster....

Subject: Porsche 968

For those who are interested here is some info stolen from CAR magazine - still the best! -  of the new 968.

The 968 will be released officially at the Frankfurt show this month, September. The principle changes are the front and rear styling, basically influences from the 928. The rear styling was cricised by CAR as being a bit of a mess and was also noted as being similar to the Scimitar SS1!

The mechanical changes are concentrated in two areas, engine and transmission. The engine features a new inlet manifold (dual tract I seem to remember) which, together with some other smallish changes,  increases power to (234 or 250, sorry, can't remember now!!). The tranmission option will be either six-speed manual or tiptronic. Top speed is 158 MPH and 0-60 around 6.1 (factory figures).

There are NO changes to the interior.

The overall impression I gained from the article was of a little dissapointment, cosmetic changes to the bodywork (personally I prefer the 944 S2) but with significant improvements mechanically. 

I believe they also said that the 968 will be built at Zuffenhausen, rather than by Audi at Neckarsulm(sp?) - possibly a sign of consolidation by Porsche and/or in recognition of the noted difference in production quality between Porsche and Audi.

Apologies if there are some errors, it's all from memory, forgot the mag! Buy the magazine, it's a good article!

Subject: Elkhart

In the grand tradition of the net, I hearby submit my impressions of the
recent PCA sponsored drivers education event at Elkhart Lake, WI (Road
America), Aug 31 & Sep 1.

First off, the weather was gorgeous - mid to high 70's and partly
cloudy.  Not so hot as to cause heat exhaustion and not so cool as to
require a jacket.  Perfect.

Administrative details: all novices and first-time Rd. America drivers
were required to attend a drivers meeting Friday night. First-time
drivers were required to drive with an instructor for track orientation
no matter their experience level. Drivers were divided into four run
groups - A, B, C, D (D = novice).  [At Rd. Atlanta, we use five groups
and all instructors are expected to drive in the top two.]
Unfortunately, my instructor was driving in the same group (C) as me
(!). This made for somewhat awkward instruction.  I'm still a rookie at
this sort of thing - I've driven at Rd. Atlanta twice and Talledega (the
road course, not the oval) once - this was my first time at Rd. America.
I'm fairly fast, heal/toe well, and drive a reasonably consistent line
(I still catch myself snoozing occasionally :-)), but I need instruction
in order to improve.  Apparently the event organizers did not expect
group C drivers to desire instruction [I'm still somewhat puzzled as to
why an instructor would drive in group C...].  On the bright side, the
event was nicely organized, with each run session scheduled at 1/2 hour
intervals - except for one exception sunday morning (due to an "off
track excursion"), run sessions started and ended exactly on time. [At
Rd.  Atlanta, no attempt is even made to publish a run-schedule much
less stick to one]. Warm up laps started as soon as the last car from
the previous session started its cool down lap. [At Rd. Atlanta, they
wait for the last car in the previous session to _pit_ before letting
the next session start]. As a consequence, each group got 4 sessions (2
hours) each day.

I was signed off to solo after my first session. At the next session, I
gridded directly behind my instructor and followed him through his line.
In the session after that, he followed me. After that, I was on my own.
While the solo time was fun, I really wasn't learning very much and my
times were barely improving.

At midday Sunday, I talked another instructor (Russ somebody - I didn't
catch his last name - he was the Chief Instructor for the weekend) into
riding with me. He showed me a completely different line - radically
different from what my first instructor (and all the other drivers in my
group) used. Actually, most turns were exactly the same, but a few
critical ones were very different.  Russ is a very aggressive driver and
his teaching technique reflects that - after a lap in which I showed him
my line, he reached over grabbed the steering wheel with his left hand
and was constantly correcting my line and yelling at me for each mistake
(most often not straightening the wheel soon enough at track-out). It
was great - I really needed that negative feedback! My previous
instructor had been much less aggressive and did not criticize very
much.

At the next session, by changing to the new line, charging harder into
the turns and driving flat out in the straights, I bettered my times by
almost 10 seconds (3:05 - 3:07) It felt fast to me... I was still
getting passed by B-group drivers (the last driving session was combined
B & C), but I was passing just about everything in C.  Russ was bragging
about helping a fellow instructor get his time in the 2:40 range (!). I
take that to be the `unobtainable' goal. Has anyone accumulated
representative `good' times for various cars and experience levels?

Anyway, here's a description of the Radical Russ line at Elkhart Lake:

Entry: stay right as you enter the track (a couple hundred yards short
	of turn 1). Hug the right side of the track until the apex then
	track out normally. [Most other drivers moved immediately to the
	left side of the track for a normal turn-in as soon as traffic
	permitted].
turn 2: do not follow the curve of the road between 1 and 3: as you
	crest the hill (I guess this is technically turn 2), look for
	the telephone poll on the far side of 3 - head for it. [most
	other drivers followed the curve of the track to the left in
	order to straighline brake along the edge of the track for 3].
turn 3: still in 3rd gear after accelerating out of 1. Approach the
	turn-in point slightly off axis (you are moving from the center
	of the track towards the turn-in point on the left. At the time
	you turn-in, you are on the left side of the track) Brake hard
	and take full advantage of the track for track out.
turn 4: Stay left for the track out from turn 3, then gently nudge the
	car towards the center of the track - aim the car between the
	`a' and `v' of the "Havoline" sign on the bridge. Let the track
	come towards you slightly, but stay about 2/3 to the left. Look
	for the `4' brake marker for turn 5 and imagine where the `2'
	marker is. (slightly left of a roundish clump of leaves in the
	trees... The `2' marker is hidden from view until you start down
	the hill. The straight from 3 to 5 is taken under full
	acceleration - I was getting to about 110mph before starting to
	brake and downshift into turn 5. [most other drivers were on the
	right side of the track at this point]
turn 5: At the `4' and `3' braking markers, stay towards the center of
	the track - be on the right side at the `2' marker and start
	aggressive braking and downshift to 2nd gear (you upshifted to
	4th in the previous straight). This turn must be taken
	relatively slowly - I almost always slid the rear end in 5
	(partially due to turbo lag and high RPMs from downshifting,
	partially from just being too fast...) - this is OK - just don't
	overcorrect! Accelerate up the hill and upshift to 3rd.  [turn 5
	was the scene of a near-miss when a 911 lost its brakes going
	into the turn - it `early apexed' in front of a car just
	approaching the apex and another close behind - fortunately it
	didn't hit either one and there was sufficient runoff such that
	it didn't hit anything before it came to a stop. This is a very
	fast track - good brakes are essential!]
turn 6: Stay right up the hill and get ready to brake right under the
	bridge - turn 6 is blind: you can't even see the turn-in cone
	until you're practically on top of it. Take 6 in 3rd and allow
	the car to track out before moving to the left of the track for
	turn-in to 7.
turn 7: lift slightly to settle the car (no need to brake) and clip the
	apex as close as possible - track out under full acceleration -
	don't start moving to the right for turn-in to 8 until about 1/3
	of the way down the straight. [This is fairly exciting - the
	track-out is downhill and under full acceleration, I almost
	always had the impression that I was going to run out of track
	at track-out...]
turn 8:	A fast turn - taken in 3rd. Stay right at track-out since we'll
	take the following turn full right.
turns 9&10: the `carousel'. This is a large constant radius corner. Stay
	full right with the right tires on the white line. Drive this
	like a skid pad - drive as fast as possible without letting the
	rear end break away - just feather the throttle to correct for
	understeer. Anticipate the apex cone at the end of the turn and
	charge full throttle (upshift to 4th) straight for the turn-in
	to turn 11. [Most drivers stayed wide (2 or 3 feet left of the
	white line) throughout the turn and waited until the very end to
	tighten the turn at the apex - this was also the Skip Barber
	instructor recommendations].
turn 11: `the kink'. This was stressed at the driver's meeting as a very
	dangerous corner. It's slightly off camber. The side rails at
	the exit of the kink have lots of scrapes and paint marks from
	cars that didn't make it... This was the scene of the only
	multicar accident of the weekend - a 911 driver ran two wheels
	off the track and tried to steer back on track, only to
	slingshot into the side of a 944. No one was hurt, and the 911
	didn't appear to be scratched, but the 944's driver's door and
	rear quarter panel were badly mangled. Anyway, tap the brakes
	before turn in and apex a foot and a half into the rumble strips
	that form the apex of the turn. [most drivers stayed wide of the
	rumble strips] Track-out and head for an orange blotch of paint
	on the far side of the track - This keeps you on the left side
	of the track [most drivers followed the curve of the track at
	this point, but eventually ended up in the same sort of gentle
	left hand turn into 12] accelerate hard and nudge the car into a
	gentle left hand constant radius turn (moving from the left of
	the track to the right then back to the left again) ending up on
	the left side of the track, perfectly positioned for straight
	line braking into turn 12.
turn 12: downshift to 3rd and brake hard (you reached 110-115 on the
	curvy `straight'). Allow the car to stay left during track-out
	slightly longer than you feel is necessary - head for the clump
	of trees on the left of the track. Now, move over the the right
	side of the track for turn-in to 13. [most drivers continued the
	turn from 12 as an arc that ends up at the turn-in for 13].
turn 13: the apex is under the bridge and is blind until after your
	turn-in.  Clip the apex and track-out well into the runoff area
	on the right side of the track. Stay right and aim for the `2'
	brake marker for 14. [Most drivers edged back over to the left
	side of the track almost immediately after track out from 13 -
	this was the only part of Russ's line that didn't feel right to
	me - I think getting over to the left of the track sooner to set
	up for 14 would have allowed a faster exit from 14, but I ran
	out of time to test out this theory...].
turn 14: (still in 3rd) Turn-in slightly late since this leads to the
	longest straight on the track - accelerate full bore up the hill
	and down again - I saw 120, 125 on the speedo by the end of the
	straight.  _Don't_ forget about turn 1 at the end of the
	straight! (As my first instructor said: "It's a good rule of
	thumb that every straight ends in a turn"). It's easy to get
	fixated on going fast in the straight...  Anyway, brake hard for
	turn 1 and downshift taking the turn in 3rd.

Elkhart Lake is a _long_ way from Atlanta (~16 hours), but the
experience was worth it. Rd. America is a beautiful, long, fast track
(~4.2 miles - advertised as the longest closed road course in the
world). I just may convince myself to come back for the next event.
My times were consistantly getting faster and faster (a couple seconds
each run). If only I'd had another day...

I've been offered what seems like a good deal on a 1968 911s.

Does anyone know:

      Going prices for such a beast, interior and exterior are supposed
      to be in good shape, 90k miles, needs clutch.

      Any congenital problems besides the lack of layshaft bearings.

Im'm very intrigued, largly because this car has only 20 less hp than
my 911sc, is probably 400 lb lighter, and is (I think) the last 
carburated 911.

Comments anyone?

	As part of a recent 48k service (by a Porsche-trained mechanic!), I
had the coolant replaced. I now have a slight coolant leak from the
cylinder head gasket, and the garage which did the service has
become an ex-garage :-(

	Reading the Haynes manual, it says that you should always re-torque
the cylinder head bolts before replacing coolant, as new coolant can
search out the slightest gap. The Haynes manual, however, does not
give the torque values, saying that this has changed a number of
times during the life of the engine. Another :-(

	Does anyone have the figures and tightening sequence for an August
1985 ('86 model year - teardrop dash) UK 2497cc 944 engine? Also
(stupid question?) do you tighten the bolts with the engine hot or
cold, or doesn't it matter?

	A few more questions while I'm wasting bandwidth :

1. Do Porsche supply the various gauges in the instrument binnacle
separately? My MPG gauge doesn't work, and I can't seem to find out
why. I removed the instrument binnacle, but there is so much
on-board electronics that I was reluctant/unable to fault-find any
further. I don't believe that it would be cost effective to replace
the whole binnacle just to get the MPG meter working again (and I'm
not even positive yet that that's where the problem lies) !!

2. Can the struts which hold the bonnet ("hood") open be
re-pressurised, or do you just have to replace them?

Thanks in advance for any advice. 

Philip

P.S. I too wish that Porsche would concentrate on enthusiasts rather
than pander to those with more money than sense. Then again, maybe
its just the problems inherent in trying to maintain a 6-year old
car which I paid 10,000 pounds for, when all the servicing/parts
costs are geared towards a new (36,000 pound!) car.

It is definitely harder to get parts for the short wheel base (pre 69)
911s.  It was not the last carburated 911.  Your SC should more than
20 HP over it.  It's a good car, probably will become valuable.  I'd
say they go for about 8-12K nowadays, really nice ones in perfect
shape with no rust (and that's rare) go for MUCH more.  The soft
window targa are worth a lot more, too.  Don't get it if you expect it
to be a reall hummer, your SC will blow it away, get it because it's a
classic that if kept in good condition will definitely increase in
value.

Subject: Re:  early 911 questions

	   I've been offered what seems like a good deal on a 1968 911s.

	   Does anyone know:

		 Going prices for such a beast, interior and exterior are supposed
		 to be in good shape, 90k miles, needs clutch.

		 Any congenital problems besides the lack of layshaft bearings.

	   Im'm very intrigued, largly because this car has only 20 less hp than
	   my 911sc, is probably 400 lb lighter, and is (I think) the last 
	   carburated 911.

	   Comments anyone?

	It is definitely harder to get parts for the short wheel base (pre 69)
	911s.  It was not the last carburated 911.  Your SC should more than
	20 HP over it. 



Why?, the `78 SC has 180 bhp (european (RoW?) figure, maybe more than California?) and the 2 litre 911S had 160 bhp, 20 bhp more? 



        Don't get it if you expect it
	to be a reall hummer, your SC will blow it away, get it because it's a
	classic that if kept in good condition will definitely increase in
	value.  

I agree about getting it because it's a classic, but the performance of the earlier cars was comparatively higher than that of the late `70's cars. I think what you mean to say is that the later cars get their (slightly greater)performance easier and more comfortably (and less interestingly?). 

Having driven a 911SC ( 3.0L 204bhp) and a 2.4 911, the 2.4 feels(!) quicker, the book times show that they are probably around the same. This may be due to gearing I suppose and of course to the peaky nature of the earlier cars.

Incidently,I was quite dissapointed with the 911 SC, having driven it directly after a new 944S2 which I thought was fantastic, press the Go pedal and wow!  The 911 SC had to be really worked unlike my 2.4, which fluffs a bit at low revs and then bang, were off. Having said that i'd exchange it for an SC if I could, simply because of the bombproof engine and the fact it will not rust!

	I recently read that opinion of Audi build quality in many countries

I don't agree with that,  I would say that the order(approximately) in Europe is


East european cars
French cars/Italian cars
Ford
VW and Opel(Vauxhall)
Rover
AUDI
BMW
Porsche and Mercedes



I know this is a generalisation, no flames please!


	I believe, from memory, that Audi also ranks higher in customer satisfaction
	and quality ratings vs Porsche in many research polls, J.D. Power, etc.


I'm not really familiar with these surveys, other than having read about them on rec.autos so I can't really comment on their methods etc. For example, i've seen one survey mentioned that showed the number of faults occuring, but did not differentiate between a faulty lightbulb and a faulty gearbox!!, anyway i'm sure you know what I mean!

Rover, for example, have recently initiated a quality control program that is heavily biased towards things which the customer is likely to notice rather than faults which he is not likely to notice so much eg panel alignment.

Customer satisfaction and quality are difficult things to accurately measure without bias, and certainly vary from country to country, Eg the BMW dealer here in Bern, Switzerland are crap compared to my local one in Cheshire, England.

Can't not flsme this.  Firstly, don't forget the technology sharing
between countries.  For example, Renault, Peugeot and Volvo (as well
as some lesser known companies) share the same engine V6 design,
the PRV, which is an awseome engine.  Next, Rover is essentially Honda
engines and other (we are not talking about door handles, but rather
engine, suspension, chasis integrity).  The saab  9000 chasis is a
joint design effort with Alfa Romeo (related to fiat BTW after many years
floundering as a govt. owned company).  Fiat and the french make awesome
small engines, remember that these countries have heavy 'gas guzzler'
taxes, and the majority of what they produce is 1.4littres and down.
Pretty responsible if you ask me, and damn good engine quality control.
I can go nuts on my renault engine.  Fiat did a very impressive engine
design, I think in the fiat uno, an engine around 1 littre.  They 
decided that they needed a very complex design that reduced engine
parts count by an absurd amount, like 30% - 50%, that ALSO permitted
full automated assembly.  It works great.  That is inovation that
helps the auto industry, not the psuedo race engines that arecompletely
wimpy form a horsepower/engineweight or a hp/displacement scale.
Also, look at the race teams of the above cars.  For example the
peougot 305 (or 309?) that did pikes peak climb in about 12 minutes.
It had a 1.9l engine making over 700hp.  Beat the glof syncro fire
breathing car by 2 minutes - that is the one that made it up without
blowing up.  And I don't recall seing audi doing well either.  
On a last note, the hottest car in germany now is the toyota corola.
This comes from a freind that lives in germany that is a car enthusiast
as well.  The general population feeling is that the small BMW's and
VW are overpriced and relatively unreliable, and the corola which
has excellent handling, power (16valve) is a reliability dream.  We
get the cream of the lot from BMW and Mercedes here, but in europe
they are just another car in the low end market (hence the $11K BMW
314, no power, cloath everything, power  nothing, and many prefer
a corola or mitsubishi).  I don't mean to start a war between country
loyalty, just saying that there is a lot more to a quality list than
an american car maagazine's view of the expensive cars.

Yes, awseomely BAD! Nobody accepts this as a suucessful engine design. The number of problems caused by those wet-liners!! . Who were the lesser known companies by the way, Alpine being owned by Renault.


        Next, Rover is essentially Honda

Well, can't really argue that there isn't a lot of Honda in there! There are UK designed and supplied engines in the 820i ( a good engine, believe it or not). In the 220/420/216/214/416 there are Rover-only engines. There are also significant metalwork differences between the Honda and the Rover models, especially in the new 8-series released this/next month.

Interesting result, 700 bhp from 1.9L, thats better than a Formula one engine!!, ok ,it probably had a turbo which means you can crank it up as much as you like assuming the block/pistons/rings/clutch/gearbox/diffential/driveshafts can take it, anyway, a 309 doesn't have a turbo option so I guess the rest of the drivetrain isn't standard either!! - not really fair then is it.

In relation to a Trabi, yes.

But is not built so well, rusts quicker(believe me!) and is not so strong in a crash.

No, i'm sorry,  VW, renault, Fiat, Ford, Opel, Vauxhall, Japanese cars, Rover, Audis  are the everyday cars.   BMW's and Mercedes's and Porsche are just not obtainable by Joe Average!!!! I live, at the moment, in Switzerland, one of the wealthiest countries in Europe - do you think we're all driving Mercs and Beemers, no chance - Opels and VW's abound!. Mercs,BMW and Porsche probably have just as great a status as anywhere!!


        (hence the $11K BMW 314,

What, where is this model, i've never seen it!!! 

BMW range starts from the 316i ($23,000) and goes 318i,320i,325i then 520i 24v up to the M5. Mercedes starts with the 190E( I think) which costs around $30,000. 

I know that Porsche prices are cheaper in America than in Germany (and Switzerland), so could anybody tell me how these prices for BMW and the Mercedes compare with those in America.



        no power 

a 325i, 0-60 in 7 seconds and 142MPH is no power?

        cloath everything

Leather is not very common in Europe.



        power  nothing

What do you want?, they are all on the options list! The American BMW distributor just has a standard options "pack" which he orders, what's the difference?



        and many prefer

Yes, they are cheaper, if you can't afford it then you have no choice.


        I don't mean to start a war between country

Who said anything about american car rags view's. Read any quality european mag ( Eg CAR ) and you'll get the same message, drive them and you can feel the difference.

Can't not flame your response!

The original posting was NOT about engines or advanced engine technology,
it was about vehicle build quality.

Manufacturer's race engines have nothing to do with vehicle build quality.

Just a few years back Audi won Pikes peak outright, in production class
and beating all the open cars....

(not the original posting, but the one you were responding to, sorry)

The American magazine was commenting on the opinions of owners and
enthusiasts in Europe, not the magazine's opinion itself.

Philip,

I have never heard of having to re-torque cylinder head bolts before
replacing engine coolant.  I checked my Haynes manuals (both the
original manual and the supposedly "updated" manual which fraudulently
claims to cover the later models), but I did not see any such
recommendation in the section (Chapter 1, Section 33) on cooling
system servicing.  Could you tell me more specifically where you saw
this in the manual?  Although the re-torquing of cylinder heads to
cure leaks might be more common than I realize, I would prefer
to replace the gasket, which will have to be done sooner or later
anyway if it has begun to leak.

As for the cylinder head torque values, I did verify your comment
about the Haynes manual's omission and deferral to a Porsche dealer.
You must have the newer manual, because the original manual does
specify a torquing procedure that matches the one specified in the
factory manual:

1st step 20 Nm
2nd step 50 Nm
3rd step 90 Nm

I scanned the index of the PCNA Tech Bulletins from 1/86 through 12/89
and did not see any bulletins that looked like these values have been
superceded for any 944.  My search was not exhaustive, however, in
that I only looked at the bulletin titles.  Of course, even the 3-step
procedure given above only applies to installing the head with a fresh
gasket.  I see no specification whatever for re-torquing a head on a
used gasket.  As for your question about engine temperatures during
torquing, the installation of a new head gasket is obviously done on a
cold engine, so I presume the torques are based on that fact.  I would
imagine this is true of engine torque specifications in general,
however.

>1. Do Porsche supply the various gauges in the instrument binnacle
>separately? My MPG gauge doesn't work, and I can't seem to find out

The instrument cluster gauges are still separate on the 85.5+ models,
so I would expect that you could just replace the tachometer (into
which the MPG gauge is integrated).  As you say, this assumes that it
needs to be replaced.  In order to make this determination (without
just swapping in a new unit), you would have to check that the MPG
meter is receiving (1) a proper voltage from the speedometer (which
requires only a voltmeter to check) and (2) fuel injector timing
signals from the DME unit (which requires an oscilloscope to check).
(Note to Kevin Gross if you're listening: I was wrong in my earlier
speculations about how this gauge functions).  You would also need
some documentation (i.e., factory manual) to be able to identify the
connections for the tests.

>2. Can the struts which hold the bonnet ("hood") open be
>re-pressurised, or do you just have to replace them?

I don't think the hood shocks can be re-pressurized.  Even if they
could, it would probably cost at least as much to have it done as
it would to just buy new ones.

Sorry for all the :-(s,
-Milo

Philip -

I think I can answer a few of your questions.

First off, an old question.  You asked about a connector at the back of the fuel
rail.  Well, I was threading a new wire through the harness last night and
finally discovered this connector to which you referred!  (Nice burn on my right
forearm from the worklight, too, to boot.  You try getting a new wire through
the eyes inside the 944S manifold!)  I discovered the plug because I knocked
open the rubber stopper which normally hides it away.  I was short of time and
didn't trace it, but will do so soon and give you an answer.

The cylinder head tightening torques for Model 82, engine types M44.01 - 04, up
to but not including Model 86 are:

"1st stage   20 Nm
2nd stage   50 Nm
3rd stage   90 Nm

"A light film of oil must be applied to the stud threads."

"As from Model 86, Engine type M 44.05 - 08

1st stage   20 Nm
2nd stage   50 Nm
3rd stage   90 Nm

"A light film of oil must be applied to the stud threads." [Yes, identical to
first set!]

"As from Model 86, Engine type M 44.05 - 10

"In conjunction with a 12 mm high nut

1st stage  20 Nm
2nd stage  90 degree rotation angle
3rd stage  90 degree rotation angle.

"A light film of oil must be applied to the stud threads.

"As from Model 89, Engine type M 44.11/12 (2.7 l)

1st stage  20 Nm
2nd stage  60 degree rotation angle
3rd stage  60 degree rotation angle

...  Workshop manual, pg. 15-10a.

The order, looking from the starboard (US passenger, UK driver!) side:

   8  4  2  6  10
   9  5  1  3  7

The spec is with a cold engine - it pretty much assumes you've just had it
apart, right?  Most torque values are with the car and engine cold, as a rule.

Having transcribed all this, I don't see why you should touch the bolts.  I have
never heard this advice before.  I would really, to put it more strongly, not
mess with them.  When you change the coolant, be sure to remove the M8 drain
bolt on the engine block as well.  You'll get a bit more fluid out through it. 
And replace the seal ring on it (8x14 mm, 900.123.002.30) and on the bleed valve
(on my 87 944S: 8x12 mm, N 013 830 7).  (The block drain bolt was deleted, if
memory serves, as of MY 89.)

Hood shocks: Replace, they cannot be repaired.  Don't try opening them!  I
believe they have been upgraded and the newer part has black-coloured pistons,
unlike the shiny original version's pistons.

MPG device: I found that there are a few pages in the workshop manual describing
its diagnosis.  I can mail copies to you given a postal address.  I would guess
that the gauges can be replaced individually.  Check with a dealership.  Or try
a VDO distributer in the UK.  (I have addresses in the US and Canada, but not
elsewhere.)  Their current catalog does not list a gauge like Porsche's MPG
widget.  I suspect it was a custom job for Porsche.

Kevin,

After I posted my last message on this head tightening issue, I made
another pass through the PCNA Tech Bulletins and this time found an
updated cylinder head tightening procedure (1987, Group 1, Number
8703).  This bulletin claims that the same tightening procedure is to
be used on all 944 and 924S engines.  Is the info you just posted more
recent than this bulletin?  If so, where did you get it?

Subject: CO meters and early 911 tuning

Hi folks,
  Here in the UK (I don't know about anywhere else) Gunson, a well known
manufacturer of DIY tuning equipment, has started selling a CO meter for
about 50 quid (~90$).  As I would like to be able to do my own tuning on
my '72 911 E and both the Haynes and Clymer manuals refer (in the
minimal stuff they have on tuning) to CO values I was wondering whether
this gadget will do the job.  The box claims an accuracy of ~0.5% CO.
 
  A related point - is the w/shop manual the only place where I can 
find info on setting up the mechanical fuel injection (I am on the
waiting list for the PCGB copy but I reccon I won't see it before
Christmas :-( ).  In fact does this manual give any tuning info at all ? 
(I would be grateful for any advice, hints etc  on the tuning issue). 
  
  Lastly, while I'm at it, does anyone know when CO meters etc became  
part of the tuner's armoury ? Would they have been used in 1972 when my
car was new and if not how did they do the set up ? 
 
Thanks in advance for any responses ...

Subject: CO meters and early 911 tuning


   I was wondering whether this gadget will do the job.  

I don't knwo about the specific product you mentioned, but a CO meter
is useful for diagnosing many problems and tuning.  Especially if you
DON'T do it a lot.

     A related point - is the w/shop manual the only place where I can 
   find info on setting up the mechanical fuel injection (I am on the
   waiting list for the PCGB copy but I reccon I won't see it before
   Christmas :-( ).  In fact does this manual give any tuning info at all ? 
   (I would be grateful for any advice, hints etc  on the tuning
   issue). 

The problem with the Bosch MFI is that the adjustments need to be made
under load, and around 2000 RPM.  This basically means while you're
driving.  The manual has a picture of the CO sensor in the exhaust
with the wire taped to the car so the readout is in the cockpit while
you are driving.

     Lastly, while I'm at it, does anyone know when CO meters etc became  
   part of the tuner's armoury ? Would they have been used in 1972 when my
   car was new and if not how did they do the set up ? 

CO meters have been around for a long time, before 1970 certainly.
Most mecahincs will use them until they can feel the difference.  When
the engine isn't running to rich or lean it is much smoother, and
makes a slightly different sound.  Once you have done it a few times,
you don't need the CO tester anymore.  That's why I said above it's
good if you don't do it much.

TO adjust the MFI you need the three special tools (stoddard and
performance products sells them, I think).  Basically, you adjust the
idle mixture until it feels smoothest (or if you have to CO tester
until the reading is correct).  Then drive the car.  When at OT, go to
2cnd or 3rd gear (it says in the factory manual) and 2000RPM and try
to accelerate.  Then stop the car (and engine) and adjust the mixture
lean.  Get back and drive, see if it feels better or worse.  If worse,
adjust it richer, if better, adjust it leaner.  Keep going until you
can't improve it.  Once you have the runnign mixture right, you have
to go back and redo the idle mizture.  Then the running mixture, again
and again until they are both as good as they can be.  It takes about
a day if it's your first time, after that it gets a little easier,
like a few hours.  It also goes a little faster with the CO meter
since you will always know if you are too lean or too rich, but
hooking it up to work whiel the car is driving is a pain.  I've
found the MFI run nicer when adjusted slightly richer than the manual
says.  Also, there is a supplement to the service manual for the Bosch
MFI.  It's out of print, but most Porsche shops have it and might let
you borrow it to photocopy.

When this system is running right, it blows away most other FI systems
and carbs, because the fuel is delivered at 90psi which is almost
double conventional EFI systems and orders of magnitude higher than
carbs.  The high pressure means excellent atomization of the fuel, and
a MUCH more efficient burn, almost like having twin plugs. They are
also a lot more reliable than the CIS or motronic, since it is
entirely mechanical and few things break.  Once it goes out of
adjustment, though, it's a real big pain to adjust properly.

Subject:  early 911 questions



   Why?, the `78 SC has 180 bhp (european (RoW?) figure, maybe more
   than California?) and the 2 litre 911S had 160 bhp, 20 bhp more?

I'll have to look it up, but the older cars (pre 72) were listed by
porsche as BHP, and the newer ones (73 and after) were listed as SAE
net.  Or maybe that's backwards.  Anyway, I don't remember the
difference, but one was higher than the other for the same actual
power, I seem to recall hearing that most listing were inaccurate
about HP comparisons between the older and newr cars.

   I agree about getting it because it's a classic, but the
   I performance of the earlier cars was comparatively higher than
   I that of the late `70's cars. I think what you mean to say is that
   I the later cars get their (slightly greater)performance easier and
   I more comfortably (and less interestingly?).

Well, from track experience, the SCs do get about .5-1 second at LRP with
comparable drivers over the old S (73 and earlier).  Exactly what
causes this I don't knwo.  It coudl better brakes, and gearing but
I dont' remember all the ratios offhand.  I agree the older, lighter,
cars *feel* faster, and certainly look a lot better.

   Incidently,I was quite dissapointed with the 911 SC, having driven
   it directly after a new 944S2 which I thought was fantastic, press
   the Go pedal and wow!  The 911 SC had to be really worked unlike my
   2.4, which fluffs a bit at low revs and then bang, were off. Having
   said that i'd exchange it for an SC if I could, simply because of
   the bombproof engine and the fact it will not rust!

Maybe tehre was something wrong with your SC.  The one's I've had and
driven were perhaps the most driveable cars I've ever been in,
excepting only the fact that double clutching was necessary to upshift
to second gear.

Milo -

My info comes from page 15-10a of the workshop manual, which was part of
supplement 17 and issues sometime in 1988.  A lot of the pages in that
supplement were devoted to converting over to the angle-torque method.  However,
as my previous piece noted, the conventional force-torque method is still
recommended for older cars.  No idea why.

Yes, I suppose, thinking about it, that the SC have higher torque values (the REAL power rating) so they should have a bit more oomph!

	   it directly after a new 944S2 which I thought was fantastic, press

The car was absolutely perfect, i'm still kicking myself for not buying it!! The reason I was dissapointed was the gearchange (worse than my `73!), in that it was not so precise(defined) and the gate seemed wide (maybe my memory is fading now!) and also because it had no guts at lowish revs. My `73 is the same but at least it gets  more exciting thereafter. It's probably the "feeling" of going fast!!

the following comes from my 1990 dated Haynes manual (ISBN 1 85010
657 6), Chapter 3 ("Cooling, heating and air conditioning systems"),
Section 2 ("Antifreeze - general information"), Page 93 :

			BEGIN QUOTE

	"Before adding antifreeze to the system, check all hose connections
and retorque the cylinder head nuts, because antifreeze tends to
search out and leak through very minute openings."

			END QUOTE

	Hence my initial question - I had my antifreeze replaced as part of
the 48k service a couple of weeks ago and now seem to have a coolant
leak from the head gasket. The garage which did the service has just
gone out of business :-(

	I have had varying advice, but Kevin suggested that I really should
get the head gasket replaced, as I could be storing up trouble for
the future by just retorquing the bolts. Now I have to decide
whether I have enough confidence to do this myself.

Subject: Turn indicator questions

Hi Folks, time for another stupid question or two, concerning my turn indicators on my '73 911. 

Having replaced the relay recently I have only just noticed that, for example, when I turn left that the left (arrow shaped) light blinks momentarily, and then both the left AND right (arrow shaped) lights blink in unison. Is this normal.

Also the indicator stalk seems a bit hesitant to stay down(turning left) and normally requires two or three attempts to make it stay there. Can this be adjusted/fixed/improved in any way?? It cancels correctly after the turn!

Is there anybody else on this list who lives/has lived in Switzerland, as I would like to ask some questions specifically about the Swiss vehicle test? for example - will it fail the test if the turn indicator is a bit hesistant to stay clicked into the turn position?

Does anybody also know if the `73 RS Carrera had a fibreglass front spoiler, my Porsche dealer says that I can order this part in fibreglass (at extortionate cost!!) and that it is the correct material!

Subject: Re:  Turn indicator questions

  Both my old 914 and my current 911 have the "double blinker" turn-signal
effect.  This is only on the gauge indicators, not on the actual turn-signals,
so it isn't a safety problem or anything.

  Apparently the blinker circuit requires a certain amount of drain from the
flasher bulbs (external) to make the gauge blinker work properly - I had a
turn signal bulb with the blinker portion the same wattage as the parking light
portion, and the gauge indicator worked fine.  However, the bulb soon burned
out (leaky turn signal housing seal) and I replaced it with a "standard" turn
signal bulb, where the blinker part is half the wattage of the parking part.
The gauge indicator behavior went back to doing its same old trick.  Apparently
this is an age related problem with the flasher unit, which is pretty pricey
if I recall correctly.

Sounds like the signal unit on the steering column needs to be
replaced.  These devicces wear out after a while, and they're sort of
expensive...

Subject: Help!  944S timing belt
Message-Id: <54910918012845/0004056890NA4EM@mcimail.com>

It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.  At the Zone 1 Autocross, my timing
belt broke.  My '87 944S is currently parked in front of Don Coburn's house in
Seaford, Long Island.  Two good things:  One, despite all, I won my class.  I
got my clock utterly cleaned Saturday, but the gentleman failed to show on
Sunday.  Two, I got to ride home to  in Jerry Pellegrino's Pink Car, which some
of you may have seen at the Parade.  (In fact, if you attended the Parade, you
are almost certain to have noticed it!)

It shouldn't have happened.  The belt was replaced with the correct part at
11,000 miles, per a recall on it.  It got retensioned in Oct 89 with a new water
pump, at 23,000 miles.  And it got retensioned a few months ago at 33,000 miles.
Now, at 37,000, it's deceased, along with at least several valves.  So, we have
a 26,000 mile-old part which Porsche says replace at 45,000 miles (or never, if
you read the MY 87-88 service tech bulletin) and retension every 15,000 or
30,000 miles (again depending on what you read).  The belt seems to be in good
condition except where damaged, and despite the stripped teeth around the
crankshaft sprocket it has good tension.

So the question is, have any of you had a similar failure in a 16-valver?  Know
anyone who has?  I would like to PCNA foot the bill as much as possible.  I'm
not out to rant and rave at the dealer or PCNA, and I am pretty sure they will
help me out to some extent.  It would help me, when talking to them, to know
whether other owners have had similar failures.

Thanks in advance...

Kevin

Subject: Help!  944S timing belt


I don't read the 944 tech bulletins from Porsche, but a guy I know had
his 35Kmi timing belt go at Bridgehampton two years ago.  He went to
the dealer about it, and they would not absorb the cost, telling him
that although the factory recommends replacement after 45K miles, that
figure is for street driven cars.  If you track your car, they
recommend it be changed at least every 30K miles, and if you are
"aggressive", at 25K miles.  That's what he told me they told him, and
he says they wouldn't budge.  He was too fed up to follow it up with
PCNA, so I don't know how much of this is the BS of the particular
dealer he went to.

In our region we've been telling people to change the 944 timing belt
every 30K, whether or not they track it, and all the people who did it
found chips or partially missing teeth in the belt.

Folks -

A friend recently lost a plexiglass (or lexan or whatever) window off a very
rare race car.  It, alas, blew off and broke into a couple of pieces in local
competition.  The factory has been no help, since the car is long out of
production.  He would like to replace it, and we're looking for someone who can
fabricate such a piece.  He also would like to replace one of the headlamp
covers, same material and slightly cracked.

Any ideas who or where to look?  This is a gorgeous car, and I owe the guy a
huge favour - he trailered my disabled car back from Long Island to Mass., round
trip, today!  Thanks greatly.

a dozen or so 944s, and about the same in 924s. No 914s, no 356s.
And that's in London, Birmingham, Warwick, Oxford, and about a week tooling

I did visit a dealership, and now have some good contacts for getting

I am  just starting to go through the back Porschephiles mail and requests.

Subject: Shock prices


I have received the catalogs from Shock Warehouse.  Below are some
examples of the suggested retail prices from the various manufacturers,
and Team.Net (et al) prices.  Below are only selected examples.  YMMV.

I also talked with Bruce about needing a list of people.  We have simplified
this tremendously.  Anyone wanting to deal thru them should call them
directly, but *do* make sure you speak to Bruce, and you *must* mention
you are from Team.Net, otherwise they won't recognize us for the discounted
prices.

	Bruce McVay
	Shock Warehouse
	800 245-SHOX

They have Bilstein, Koni, KYB, Boge and shocks, Heckethorn off-road shocks,
Eibach suspensions, and other related items.

Please note: The examples below are things I looked up via the catalogs,
and are subject to error (I know how to read, but you know  :-).  Also,
the prices speak nothing of the relative quality of the brands.  That's
up to you to decide.  Bruce can help with advice as to what is best for
you.

I would prefer that you *don't* call me for prices.  I am not an expert,
and frankly, I don't think my employer would like me spending the
time to look up the items in the catalogs responding to e-mail.  That's
what Bruce gets paid for.  In fact, Bruce may be able to do better on
certain prices than I would be able to quote, so it is in your interest
to talk to him directly.  Do mail me if you have questions about
the Shock Warehouse, or the mechanisms for dealing with them.
Also, reactions to the samples are welcome.

The prices below are only representative samples, and may not accurately
represent the companies offerings, nor what is actually available for
a particular car.

Examples:

KONI:			Sugg			Team.Net

	And a long strange trip it's been. Driving in the UK is
	so strange -- and they don't seem to enforce the speedlimits
	on the motorways (equiv. to US Interstates)!!!


Yes they do, I had a nice big fine a few years ago to prove it. Maybe they just don't use it for revenue purposes. Average speeds in the fast lane on the M1 amd M6 are 80-90MPH (assuming the traffic is moving!!) and the speed limit is 70 MPH. If you are caught at over 100MPH then you will probably loose your license for a while.



        But, I only saw 3 911s,
	a dozen or so 944s, and about the same in 924s. No 914s, no 356s.
	And that's in London, Birmingham, Warwick, Oxford, and about a week tooling 
	about the country.


911's are fairly rare in the UK, 924's and 944's are seen fairly regularly depending on what part of the country you are in - mainly London, South east and North West. 914's were not imported to the UK, no RHD were made I believe. 356`s are rare, i've never seen one in the UK!

Subject: Porsche Parts: Mail order and Used?
Cc: Ben.Dubin@Eng.Sun.COM


Two questions,

I have a 73 911T and have been looking around for a good mail order
parts place.  I have seen Automotion's and Performance's.  While
their catalogs are very nice and complete, there prices are nothing
to write home about.  Is there a low price mail order place, one
that perhaps sells factory parts too?  If they have a catalog great
if not that is okay.  Any real life experience dealing with them would
be very helpful.

Also, does anybody know of a good used parts shop.  The guy I purchased
my 911 from put one of those Mitcom update rear ends on the car (I 
can't stand it!).  I would like the original tail pieces.  If anyone
out there has some or all of the parts or knows of a good Porsche
wrecker please let me know.

Please post all responses.

Many thanks,

Ben Dubin

Subject: Re:  Welcome to the List

Hi,

I am new to the list so I hope not to offend any .etiquette norms ;^)

I am a guy who has known for 10 years that I will someday
own a 911--even though I have never driven or even ridden
in one... 

My assumption is that for around 10k I can by a late 60's
early 70's 911 in fair shape--more or less stock.  I know that 
there are a lot of 912's out there but my sense is that the 
4 cylinder motor is just not going to cut it for me.  Not that I
am going to be driving all that fast.  My wife has a 5.0
Mustang and I don't think I've ever been over 85 mph.  It's not 
top speed that matters, it's quickness and whether or not you
can cruise at 75-80 without feeling like the engine is working
too hard.

Please help me with a sanity test.  Should I go for a 912
and be driving a Porsche sooner?  Or should I wait until
I can really afford a 911?  Or are my assumptions all wrong?
What are the trade-offs and advantages to either?

Your perspectives would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Volney Spalding

Current Car: 84 GTI...at least it's German ;^)

I can tell you lots about 912's.  I own one.  It needs restoration 
though.  The original 912 was made from 1965 (my year) to 1968 I
think, then the 912E came out in 1976 I think, a 911 with the 914
engine.
To understand the 912, the 1964 356 cost something like 3,200 bucks.
The 65 911 cost 6,500, DOUBLE.  So to keep the change moderate, 
they put the 356 engine in the 911 and sold them for 3700 bucks.  
Nothing was diffenet but the engine, a slight instrument panel 
change and the number.  So handling and the like were the same.
100sae hp vs 140sae hp in the 911.  The 911 did 0 - 60 in 9 seconds.
(140 hp in a 2,300 pound car).  The 912 in 11.5 seconds.  All times
and figures are acurate to about 10%, the quality of my memory is
a limit.  One other thing, the first year they sold 2 times as many
912 as 911's!!!  Excellence magazine had an issue about the 912, you
can back order it.  Also, to speed on the 912 is over 110, and I think
125+ for the 911.  There's the difference.  The 912 is rare now only
because they didn't sell many after the first year and also the
911 has been in production for 25 years now.  
Also, the 912 is basically a modified (well modified) VW beetle
engine (1950 era beleive it or not), many parts are cheap, some 
are outrageous (crank shaft).  Same goes for 911 engines, I've found
that except for a few luck models all the parts are outrageous
in those.  Any other questions, I may know the answer.


I must flame this one.
>Current Car: 84 GTI>...at least it's German ;^)
There are lots of great cars in the world that are not german, don't
put those typical blinders on, you may find yourself driving relative
garbage someday.

I drove a 912 last summer.  It was a 67 (good year), and had the Weber
replacment carbs.  My father drove it out of the lot, and out towards
the interstate.  At the interstate, he got out and traded spots with me.
I figured I'd just get a feel for the 0-60 time, since the road was so
heavily travelled as to make a top-speed run out of the question 8^).
Was I impressed?  Well, by the time I looked down at the speedo, expecting
to see it pass 60 soon, we were already at 90!!!  Yes, the car went FAR
quicker and FAR smoother and more effortlessly than my neighbor's 5.0
Mustang.  No fanfare, growls, or other disgustingly phallic-like noises,
with the windows closed, at least.  Oh, it sounded alive with the windows
open, however.  By the way, 90 is about 5750 in second gear.  The sweet
sound of German, air-cooled machines!  I don't know how the 912 would fare
against the 5.0 in a drag race, but I would take the 912 any day, especially
considering it's heritage, relative rarity, and going price.
If you decide to look for a 912, email me for some free advice concerning
each year's problems.  Good luck!

   My recommendation: check-out any issue of "Excellence" magazine; they have
many ads for Porsche parts and accessories. Their classified section can also 
reveal some interesting items (i.e. body and engine parts). Hope this helps!

Subject: 911 clutch question
Date: Thu, 26 Sep 91 10:54:13 MDT


My '72 911 clutch is beginning to have problems. As far as I know, it is
the original and has 122,000 miles. At first I noticed a little noise
when first engaging (in reverse) after work each day. Sounded like a bit
of unevenness somewhere, like maybe a little oil leaked onto the clutch
somewhere. Now I'm getting some serious chattering (like vibrates the
whole car sometimes) when engaging, but not all the time. This happens
both in 1st and reverse. It seems to be worse when you need the clutch
the most (hills, engine at say 2000 rpm when engaging). Sounds like
something is warped. 

This is probably an obvious problem to some of you. If so, is it
something I should fix immediately, or can I live with it for a while? I
realize replacing the clutch means pulling the engine. Other than it being 
a lot of work, is it a particularly difficult job to do yourself? (My most
advanced job has been replacing a cylinder head on a BMW 2002.)

Thanks for any advice.

Subject: Re:  911 clutch question

  Sounds like a bad pressure plate to me, but also be sure to check the clutch
cable first.  On the 72-73 911s there is a reinforced rubber section around
the clutch cable that runs between the transmission and the firewall.  If this
section is broken, you get a nasty positive feedback effect.  When the engine
starts to engage, it moves forward on its mounts and thus gives the cable more
play, engaging it further.  The effect is something like repeatedly dropping
the clutch, and only comes into play when you are starting from 1st gear.
...this is why you don't use the early 911 clutch cable on the 72-73 ;-)

  I've never dropped the engine in my 911 - on the 914 I could change the 
clutch in about 5 hours, only dropping the transmission.  I suspect you could
get away with only dropping the transmission on the 911 too, but I'm not sure...

Subject: Re:  911 clutch question

After you've done it a couple of times, the 911 engine comes out in
1/2 hour.  A few more minutes to put it back in.  I think it would
be much easier to drop the engine than to attempt to drop just the
tranny.  Further, most of the work in dropping the engine/tranny is
done by the time you've got the tranny itself ready to drop (not
including tranny to engine disconnection.)  The major added work in 
dropping them together is draining the oil so you can disconnect the 
oil lines.

Also, I don't think there is enough space lengthwise to separate the 
tranny starting from the position of both being installed in the car.

If you attempt to drop the tranny separately and give up, which I 
think is likely, reconnecting it to the the engine and droppng them 
as a unit will consume much more time. So in my opinion you are being
penny wise and pound foolish.

As a last argument, removal of the engine and tranny in one piece is 
the way it was designed.

Then if you do what I would probably have when I was inexperienced
(not to imply that you are too), and ignore the advice of others and go
try to drop just the tranny just to see if I could do it, let us know 
how it went.    8-)  8-)

Maybe somebody else will post that the tranny can be dropped in 5 usec
once you know how...

Subject: 911 clutch question


Check your cable and the pedal stop on the floorboard.  If these are
OK, then your clutch&pressure plate probably need to be replaced.
This is not a hard job, the easiest technique is to just drop the
engine, leaving the transmission in.  If you've never dropped the
engine, then it's probably not going to be easy either, but if you
want to do your own work you should know how to drop the engine.

A few words of advice if you do it yourself:

1) Be careful removing the flywheel bolts.  They have a 12pt star bolt
   that is very easy to strip.  Make sure the tool is all the way in,
   and use a long pipe so you can turn it gently.

2) Examine the main engine seal carefullly.  If there is even the
   slightest markings or signs of wear, replace it.  This is a common
   cause of MAJOR oil leaks in 911s.  If there is oil in the clutch housing
   then probably it needs to be replaced even if it looks OK.

3) This job takes two people.

4) When you reattach the clutch cable, there should be about 1" of
   play in the pedal, and adjust the floorboard stop so the the clutch
   fork does not rub against the housing.


Actually, I'm about to replace the main seal on a friends car, so If
you like I'll try to remember to take notes - or you coudl fly over
and watch.

You should not drop the tranny alone.  It is a real big pain in the
neck, and that's with a lift.  We tried it once and vowed not to do it
again. 

Dropping the engine alone is quite simple, and avoids the rather
lengthy job of removing the cv joints.  This can't be done on the cars
with the "push type" clutch (70 and 71, I think), and shouldn't be
done on the SCs and later, I forget why...

Hey, o.k. call me stupid but I don't know what this is.  When I get home
at night and turn off the engine, there is still a sound coming
out (besides the fan).  It goes for about 10 seconds or so and thenis
off for about 5 minutes, then it comes back, etc.  When it goes
off there is a slight gurgeling sound as if it is either pumping oil
or coolant.  (BTW, I have a 1989 951).

A second question of similar topic is when I first start my car about
the time I'm ready to go, there is a 1 to 2 second "burrr" as if a
servo is moving into (or out of) place.

Perry -

The sound you hear when shutting off your car is a cool-down pump which
continues to circulate coolant in 951-series cars after the car has been turned
off.  It runs for at least 30 seconds and until the temp drops enough.  Charlie
Learoyd wrote a description of in the June Pano's Tech Q&A column - recommend yu
read it.  The extra circulation is to keep the turbo from heat-soaking and
coking itself.

As for your other problem, I don't quite understand your brief description. 
Does the "solenoid" bzzz occur when starting the engine, or when, having started
the car, you are putting it in gear and driving away?

That pump doesn't eliminate the need to idle the engine for a bit after
parking the car, though, does it?

That's quite true: the turbo has to spin down from a very high speed (up to 
100,000 rpm), and it requires adequate lubrication during the process. By 
running the car at idle for a minute or two, oil pressure is maintained and
good lubrication of the rotor bearings allows the turbo to spin down to idle
speeds (quite a bit lower - perhaps only 10,000 rpm or less), from which it
will continue to spin down safely even without additional oil flow. The extra
cooling is still very good design - you can't have too much insurance on your
turbine bearings.

Almost all new cars with electric cooling fans run for a minute or
two - when hot - after you shut the car off.  This allows for more
even cooling of components which helps prevent things like head warp.
It does NOT mean turbo owners of any make or model can shut their cars off
without a minute at idle.

The above is true, but my understanding is that the 944 Turbo (951) in
particular goes further, and circulates coolant through the turbo
bearings with a separate pump. This provides an effective sink for the
heat stored in the turbo, thereby reducing the temperature rise in the
turbo bearings after a hot shutdown. This is the same purpose for allowing
a minute or two of idle after hard usage. As someone else noted, you do have
to wait for the turbo shaft to slow down before shutdown to continue
to provide oil pressure to its bearings, but this takes modest numbers
of seconds, not minutes.

Patty and John -

I find it easy to agree with what John says: letting the car idle cannot hurt
and will almost certainly help.  I don't know whether Porsche has a stated
recommendation regarding cool-down.

When I bought my 951, the salesman (who used to be a service manager at
a Porsche dealership) recommended three minutes. I suspect they say that
so folks will do it for at least 30 seconds. :-)  

Anyway, the odds are that when I pull into a parking space there's
still a couple minutes left on the Pink Floyd song I'm listening to, so
I might as well let the car idle while the song ends. :-)

Subject: Chevy Wheels


This weekend I bought a set of Porsche 5 1/2" x 15" chrome wheels with a
3 68 datestamp at a flea market in San Jose.  The funny part of the story 
is that the seller insisted that the wheels were from a Chevy!  I can just
about picture a low-rider cruising through East San Jose with Porsche
rims...  Logical explanation no. 1: the guy had no idea what the wheels
fit, and since Chevys have 15" 5-bolt rims, they must be Chevy rims.
Logical explanation no. 2: they were hot, and it's a lot easier to sell
Chevy parts in East San Jose than Porsche parts.  Actually, the rims were
kind of warm after sitting out in the sun all morning...

Anyhow, I do have a few questions.  
	The rims have a P with  a triangle around it - which manufacturer 
		does this indicate?  
	Were these the stock wheels for both 911's and 912's in 1968?
	What size tires fit these rims?

BTW, I intend to put these rims on my '64 356C.  In appearance they are
identical to the stock 4 1/2" wheels currently on the car.
