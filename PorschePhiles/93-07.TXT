Subject: Tweeks Swap Meet


At the Stoddard event I found four alloys, very clean, for $240!!
Plus some other nifty "stuff" that you just cant walk by.....

I'll be at the Tweeks event, now that the welding is done on my
'66 912, its on to other stuff.  Sooo, I'm looking for:

	2 NEAR PERFECT FENDERS
	4 CENTER CAPS FOR ALLOYS (just usable ones for now)
	and lots of misc. stuff

SUBJECT: More Splitfire complaining

===> This is a copy of an article I posted on rec.autos.tech... <===

Okay, so I didn't get it all off my chest last time (re: 6/29 posting)...

Something I forgot to mention was the difficulty in replacing the Splitfires
because of their POOR QUALITY sealing washers.  You see, Splitfire
gives you washers that are too big, versus other manufacturers that the
crush washer fits snugly once it's been compressed.  EVERY one of the
Splitfire washers came off when I was removing the plug.  If you have a
motor that the plug hole is easily accessed -- this is a minor hassle.

Mine is an old Porsche 911, where the plug hole is 6 inches in and
impossible to see or feel.  Compounding my problem, I didn't notice
the washers weren't on the plugs until I was on the fifth one I was
changing!  The washers don't just fall away either, some stayed in place
(new plug ends up slightly recessed in the head), one wedged itself partway
under the new plug's washer (ruining it). 3 1/2 hours and lots of creative work
with magnets later....  The car with NGKs is happy again.  The spark plug
moral: if it aint broke, don't screw with it!

A hard lesson to learn a few days before a race!

Another note:  on close inspection, the Splitfires don't appear to have
all had spark going to both sides of their split ground prong.  I doubt
that the pretty perfect picture they show of their plug firing in their ads
is what actually occurs in your engine (or at least my engine).

'Nuff said...

Well, while this mailing list has been getting written up more
and more frequently in the various PCA region newsletters, we finally
hit the Big Time this week! In the just-hit-my-mail-today issue of
Excellence, phellow 'phile Dom Miliano has a two page article (starting
on p. 105) called "I Drive the Porsche Electric" about, you guessed it -- US.

Hats off to Dom, and a reminder to everyone out there to go buy this issue
if you're not already a subscriber.

Subject: HELP: Removing steering rack



	Howdy all,

	I am having problems getting the steering rack out of the car.
I have the whole front suspension out except that I can't get the
steering rack apart (separating the steering rack and aux rack?). The
Haynes manual seems to say that you need to take the one cover
plate off, and gently tap on the botton of the rod that is there. I
tried that nad nothing happens.  Are there any bolts that actually hold
the steering rack into the aux rack (the horizontal part that has the tie 
rods, etc)?  I am sorry about my terminology, but I just couldn't make
sense of what the manual is telling me to do.

	And help would be REALLY appreciated, Alex

Any given spark is only going to go to one prong, anyway.
Once there's a plasma path from the center electrode to one
of the prongs, that is the lowest resistance path for further
current to flow: it won't go anywhere else.

Splitfires.

Hey Scott, how you guys doin' in Texas? I miss seeing you and Sally at 
the Zone 7 events.

I've been using them in my 944 for over a year with good results, the 
gasket issue extends to other japanese brands also. I replaced mine with
some Bosch gaskets, my results are about a 4 hp improvement and a 
similar improvement in torque. One thing, make sure the plugs are 
torqued to at least 25 ft-lbs with NO anti-sieze compound on the threads
to prevent backing out. if the threads on your Porsche sparkplug holes 
seem tight, use a thread chaser to clean them before installing the next
 set of plugs.

Snap-on, Craftsman and others sell this tool. 

By the way, recheck all gaps for the Splitfires (and all new plugs) 
prior to installation.

My own feeling is that the Splitfires will work better in a wedge-type
head (944, 924, 928, 914 and 912E 2 valve only) because of the partially
 obscured area of a conventional plug. A herron type head, 911 type, 
sees less improvement unless you have emissions-type pistons. I have 
dyno results for the 944 on hand.

Subject: Monthly Update

July 1993

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

The big news this month: Porschephiles is famous! In addition to 
write-ups in several PCA newsletters, we are also featured in this
months edition of Excellence magazine, in an article called "I Drive
the Porsche Electric". So, go out and impress your friends!

A big welcome to the new members from Golden Gate, who have responded
to the writeup in their newsletter. And could someone out there talk
to your editor and get him to mail me a copy?

A FAQ is supposedly under preparation. 

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available, which is perhaps unfortunate. Oh well.

Remember, while it seems like a good idea when you're first starting out
on the list to know what has gone on before, there are OVER 7 MEG of 
archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. Period. And PLEASE DO 
NOT FTP between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll have to take access away. 
We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, you know...  Also DO NOT 
ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too much work. Thank you.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business service where we could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

I still edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region of the PCA, and
still plan to put some of the articles on-line for FTP in 
/pub/pca/newsletters/lone-star. If you edit a newsletter or would like to just i
type in articles from your newsletter, you can upload them into the directory
/pub/pca/newsletters/UPLOAD.

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (800) 582-6892.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Subject: Spinning Porsches.....it can be used as an advantage!!!

TO: autox@autox.team.net,
    INGRAM_GLENN/HPBOI1_03@hpdmd48

.......................................................................

In reference to the question about spinning P Cars..

Having driven Porsches for over 15 years, I have (many times!) experienced what
you described!  Early 911's (especially pre-'69 SWB cars) exhibit what is
called 'trailing throttle oversteer (spinning when you lift the throttle as
you enter a turn!!!). This a very characteristic of 911's that are:

1. Not set up for autocrossing (adjustable shocks, large front bar, etc)
2. Not SMOOTHLY transitioned into a corner under braking.
3. Going WAY TO FAST into a Corner (not hope unless you have a new C2 with
   ABS!!!).

Generally, this is a problem with 911's .  It just takes lots of practice
setting the car up properly before (!) you enter a corner.  I typically
try to brake in a straight line before the corner to evenly load the suspension
and transition into the corner underpower to control the attitude of the
car.

BUT.... this can be REALLY USEFUL!!!  In an autocross course, rotation around a
corner can be the ticket to VERY QUICK times, especially if your car
has LSD!!!  The ability of a rear engined car to 'rotate' easily keep us in
the running with more sophisticated machinery (Mazda RX7 TT's for instance).
We can enter a corner at speed, set the car up, rotate (not spin) at the apex,
ans accelerate like H*LL out of the corner.  This, however take LOTS of
experience (which I still have not mastered !) to pull off, but when you do
the other cars in your class better watch out (IMHO-not flame intended
to all the other neat cars in AS/ASP!!)  I must admit that you need to squeeze
the brakes as you set the car up for a corner- DO NOT SLAM (!!!) on the brakes,
because the instantanious weight transfer to the front REALLY un-balances
a 911 and cause you to spin- before you can say 'Oh Sh*t...'!!

IF you need additional info, especially on car setup/shock settings and the like

please feel free to call me (208-396-5047 W) so I can be of help to
a fellow P Driver (going extinct due to the 'new trick' cars in AS ! HA)

G'day,


MR Wizard

If anyone going to the Tweeks swap meet notices any 72-72 911E or S
non-sunroof coupes for sale that look pretty nice, I would
appreciate the tel. number.

Also, anyone who is planning to attend the LARGE SVRA vintage race
at Mid-Ohio on the 9-11 of July, stop by and say hi.  Look for
mini-cooper #42 (red) next to several 356 porsches. (#s 60 and 34
and 0)

I have been trying for months (without success) to diagnose
a very low pitched noise and vibration coming from the front
end of my 86 Carrera. It only happens at speeds of less than 5mph --
if I coast to a halt it'll be in the last 10 feet. I've repacked
the wheel bearings, adjusted and tightened the clamping nut, peplaced
(oops..replaced) the front pads. You can hear the noise (same pitch
as if you blew over the mouth of an empty beer bottle), and you can
feel the vibration in the steering wheel.  Nothing appears to be
haywire. Any ideas? HELP!!

Thanks,

Subject: Reluctant Sale: 911 S


With our first child on the way, and the need to buy a home, my 911 is
reluctantly for sale.  I love this car, but really need the money and
may even consider parting it out if it is worth it.  Of course, with
the market the way it is, I may have to keep it (rats, darn...). E-mail
if interested, and I'm happy to send photos.

'67 911 S  non-sunroof coupe.  #11800070.  (1st revision of the original 'S')
Short wheelbase, B-series front susp., dual-circuit brakes, later style guages.
German market, imported in 1980.  One of very very few '118's in North America.

Original engine, #4080062, and transmission.
Recent engine rebuild, very recent trans rebuild, all receipts.  
Runs beautifully, smooth and powerful from 2500 to 7500 rpm
(well, actually, smooth from 2500, no real power until 4000!).
K&Ns, Bursch headers, 6" early Fuchs, early '70's 'S' front bumper,
otherwise totally stock.  Gas heater, and it works, too!
Beautiful exterior, nice trim but no decos, most rubber replaced.

Typical rust on the bottom, though I just had the front suspension area
redone (very high quality job, with photos).  Will need rear longitudinal
patches one day, and inner rockers one day.  Currently not carpeted, though 
I have it all.  Car is solid, daily driver but extremely clean including 
engine and trans.

I have spent at least CDN$20,000, and have it advertised here for $15,000
(US$11,700).  Any thoughts on its value?  There are so few early 911s here 
that haven't got whale tails, flares and updated bumpers, that it is hard to 
compare against anything.

Thanks

Jim -

Check the front struts for play.  With the wheel off on a given side,
push and pull the strut and see whether the shock piston cocks slightly
from side to side.  I've seen this in 911's and 944's, and it can be
misdiagnosed as a loose wheel bearing, and can lead to a tooting or
"beer bottle" noise.

You don't mention whether your car is dead stock or not.  If not, what
changes?  Any chance of a brake duct hose rubbing against the wheel or
tire?

 Re: Spinning Porsches

 It _is_ possible, contrary to popular belief, to spin a 914 as well.
 I've been lucky enough to do it twice (and not hit anything either
 time). Both events came from driving too fast on wet roads (believed
 to be dry). I must say that it is the fastest spin I've ever been
 in - little or no warning. 

 But then, this is all anecdotal (or it will be after you read it),
 and you should go back to believing that 914s don't spin. Because
 after all, you haven't seen one spin, have you?

 Re: 912Es

 Does the 912E use a flat-4 anything like the 914's VW motor? 
 Forgive my ignorance of other models in the Porsche line.

 Re: the Boxster

 Just saw the brochure on the Boxster prototype at my Porsche
 dealer. Amazing looking car. Very reminiscent of the Spyder.
 Two questions: is it really going to be 30-35K? If so, what
 motor? Oh - third question: what are they going to use for a
 top?

 ---

 Segue. Just discovered that I have a short in the fuel injection
 harness of my 914 1.7L motor. Anyone else ever have this problem
 with the 914? I would expect it to be quite unusual. The
 replacement harness is typically quite expensive (over $500).

 Finally, restoration (such as it is) on my '73 2.0L is proceeding.
 Going to try fitting the 911 suspension in the next six weeks.
 Bought a nice set of 6x15 alloys for $250 at the Partshaven swap
 meet - I thought that was cheap until I saw that Ron got his for 
 $240. Still have to fit in new Koni struts - what's this about the
 gas adjustables not being available to fit '73 911 struts? 

 I had the car painted 1979 Ferrari Red - let's hope I don't
 offend too many cognescenti..

 cheers,
 Stef

 - can't wait to use those 911 calipers on my 914. I think the
 car may do a stoppie :->.

I just had the dealer (The Sewickley Car Store, Pittsburgh, PA) change the

there is a $110 charge for "drilling out broken bolts in wastegate unit". The 
mechanic told me that two bolts broke off when he was trying to remove the 
wastegate as part of the clutch change. My question is, do I have to pay for 
what they brake ? I would assume that at the premium price they charge, there is 
leanway for this type of mishappenings. Isn't that the "rational" behind the

Sorry for not replying sooner.  Unfortunately, even th 87-forward 911
hyrdraulic clutches lack the nice inspection port that 944's have.  Said
port lets you check both release fork travel (indicating proper function),
and friction disk wear.

Not clear to me whether you feel you have a problem.  You should be able
to slip the clutch as a matter of normal use.  If it's engaging "high",
make sure the free play at the pedal is properly adjusted.  If not, and
the rod is too far extended even when trhe pedal is released, you will
never be fully off the clutch, and it will be as though you were always
riding the clutch.

The free play adjustment is quite easy, and I would assume your dealer can
or has already done it for you.

Can't say whether to replace it now.  You need to figure out whether there
is a problem.

Well, this really boils down to a few subquestions.  First would be whether
it is reasonable to expect exhaust bolts/studs to freeze and break during
r&r.  If the answer is no, then the mechanic messed up and it might not be
unreasonable to expect them to eat the cost.

If the answer is yes, then you have another question.  If exhaust bolts
sometime break during work, should you build the cost of their repair
into a flat rate bill, or should you charge only customers who are
unlucky enough to have this happen to them?

My opinion and experience is that exhaust bolts and studs do from time to
time seize and break, through no fault of the mechanic.  I suspect that
a stressed piece like a wastegate might be more prone to this sort of
problem, but I don't drive or work on turbos.  You should also know that
the book time for a 951 clutch is huge, like 20 hours or so.  A good
mechanic can do it in less time and charge accordingly.  I personally would
much rather pay for what time and materials it takes to do a job, rather
than book.  If I get unlucky, hey, shit happens.

Given the dealer cost of a clutch and expected labor time, I think that
$1900 is not an unfair price.  It's a bitch of a job, but that's not
Sewickley's fault.

Subject: Wheels/Bearings/Beer Bottles


I'd like some assistance with the following three items:

1. Wheels

I've been researching my options for a set of autox wheels to use
on my 924S.  Apparently the 7x15 phone dials from the '87 944
were an option on the 924 (rears only).  This leads me to wonder 
whether other 7x15 wheels (Fuchs, cookie cutters) would fit too.
What is the offset on those phone dials, and are there any other
styles with the same (or nearly the same) offset?

2. Bearings

At my recent major service I had the front wheel bearings checked.
I was told that they were passable, but should be replaced in the not
too distant future (I figured I'd do it before the end of the season).
I looked over the procedure in the 924 and 931 manuals, and have the
following questions:

Are inner and outer bearings replaced at the same time (i.e. they
wear at the same rate)?

Are the races replaced with the bearings, or just inspected for
proper wear limits? If the latter, what are the limits?

Does the 931 race replacement procedure (involving heating the hub
and using the special tools VW 511, 9154, and P 263) apply to the
944/924S hub? Are there shadetree alternatives?

(Massachusetts readers) Can you recommend any machine shops in the
Boston area to replace the races?

3. Beer bottles

You mean like blowing in a beer bottle? I have that noise at (I believe)
the right rear corner of the car.  It's very intermittent now (once or 
twice for a few seconds per month), but happened more frequently in 
40-50 F weather, and always at slow speeds (10-15 MPH, when decellerating
or turning).  Since it had basically gone away, I didn't mention it when 
I took it in for service, but I'd like to nail it down if I can.

Thanks,

Larry Rebarchik - 

Update on repairs to 914-6, got the trans rebuilt with new 1st and 2nd

they are ready.  In the process of cleaning the exaust manifold and heater

exaust valves.  This warranted a check of the heads.  After pulling the
heads off, we found a couple a flattened lobes on one of the cam shafts,  it
turned out to be a clogged oil splash tube that caused this.  So, a couple
of valves later and a new cam, the engine is coming back together, waiting
on a new clutch and flywheel now.

Any folks have a comment on how the oil splash tubes might have clogged, or

The 914 is one of those "it depends" deals. If the windshield is loose
because of the seal being shot, then you should go to a glass shop and
have them re-install the windshield. Should be cheap, $50 or so. If it's
loose because it's been loose before and the metal has rusted away, well,
that's not so good, nor cheap to fix. Involves fabricating new metal from 
flat stock, welding it in, etc. Unfortunately, you won't know until the

Which is why I developed the following seat-of-the-pants test: find a long
level stretch of road. From a dead stop, wind the car all the way past
red line in first, then speedshift into *fourth*. If you hear a juddering
noise, or smell burnt clutch lining, you have a problem.

Hmmm. That's hard. To the best of my knowledge, the only *REAL* fix is to

"oil splash tubes"??? explain, please.... do you mean the oil return tubes
from the heads to the case, or the cam oiler galley, or the hose that goes
from the main case to the heads???

In general, any "plugged up" oil passage is either an indication that
the oil wasn't properly maintained, or of some other catastrophic event
in the life of the engine.

Hmmm. That's hard. To the best of my knowledge, the only *REAL* fix is to

Stan,
Along the same line of 914 glass.
What collective knowledge do we have on ways to fix a rattling rear window?

It appears to be loose on the bottom and sides.

Larry Rebarchik - 

Update on repairs to 914-6, got the trans rebuilt with new 1st and 2nd
syncros, and dogteeth, it's ready to go in.  We finished with the carbs and
they are ready.  In the process of cleaning the exaust manifold and heater
boxes, we noticed an excessive amount of carbon buildup on some of the
exaust valves.  This warranted a check of the heads.  After pulling the
heads off, we found a couple a flattened lobes on one of the cam shafts,  it
turned out to be a clogged oil splash tube that caused this.  So, a couple
of valves later and a new cam, the engine is coming back together, waiting
on a new clutch and flywheel now.

Any folks have a comment on how the oil splash tubes might have clogged, or
any way to catch this problem before it wears the cam down too far?

The 914 is one of those "it depends" deals. If the windshield is loose
because of the seal being shot, then you should go to a glass shop and
have them re-install the windshield. Should be cheap, $50 or so. If it's
loose because it's been loose before and the metal has rusted away, well,
that's not so good, nor cheap to fix. Involves fabricating new metal from 
flat stock, welding it in, etc. Unfortunately, you won't know until the 
glass is out...

Hi All-

I'm a bit dizzy after my drive up from New York to Boston yesterday.  It seems
I have developed a bit of a fuel tank leak, or some sort of fuel related
problem.  After filling up, the smell is the worst, and even with the
windows down at 70 MPH and the sunroof opened up (not off; experiment shows
this worsens the smell), it still is apparent.  When the tank gets emptied,
the smell is lessened, but still strong.  Either that, or I'm getting used
to it.  I don't think this has anything to do with the charcoal canister
in the engine compartment (as was mentioned earlier in this group), but 
may be related to the filling area, since the smell is strongest there.  So:

a) Anybody ever have this problem?

b) Any ideas on what it might be?

c) Pulling back the cargo-area rug,  I notice that there is a plastic cover
over the soft fuel hoses.  I once sealed this area with silicone, when 
I thought I smelled fuel back there a long while back.  This may have
hidden the problem until now!  Should this plastic cover be sealed against
the interior of the car, or is it just a cover to prevent things from
crushing the fuel hoses? 

d) Do the soft fuel hoses that connect the tank to the the filler neck go
bad? 

e) Now for the painful part- How difficult is it to pull the tank?  I really don't 
want to go this route, but given my problem, it may be necessary. 

Thanks for any input/help in advance.

The Goodyear GS and GS-C's are ok for stock, since these are the

They work OK but at not up to the 'stickiness' for the other
AX tires (even the old 008RTU are stickier). Besides, they take to long to
heat up (they are RR compounded tires- takes a lap to heat them up...)).

HOWEVER, having driven in the RAIN on the GS-C's, they are FANTASTIC!!!
Lots of grip and VERY RESPONSIVE!!!

If they release a AX compound next year, they could be quick!

As far as the current RR tire (GS-CS), they wear really quick and are only
good for 3-4 Heat cycles- then they get real greasy!!! (info from a friend
who runs a C2 in the Porsche Club Race Series).  The BFG's last much longer
and lap times are only .5 seconds off of the GS-CS's (but in a 20 minute
race, that can add up, so if you want to be the fastest, you pay......)

I concur - $1900 is about right for a dealer 951 clutch job.  Charging 
for the broken bolt repair is probably fair too, since bolt condition 
is a function of the particular vehicle's care.

I've fiddled with lots of 951 exhaust hardware.  It's good quality 
stuff, and stays in good shape despite high heat levels.  Do you drive 
your car in the winter salt?  I don't, and I have no hardware problems. 
 This might be a contributor.

944 series clutches are just awful expensive, no way around it!

| 2. Bearings
|
| At my recent major service I had the front wheel bearings checked.
| I was told that they were passable, but should be replaced in the not
| too distant future (I figured I'd do it before the end of the season).
| I looked over the procedure in the 924 and 931 manuals, and have the
| following questions:
|
| Are inner and outer bearings replaced at the same time (i.e. they
| wear at the same rate)?
I'd recommend replacing both - they're cheap and you'll have both of 
them in your hand simultaneously [front], so why not?  There's no sense 
in taking all the time (or $, if done by a shop) to only replace one.

| Are the races replaced with the bearings, or just inspected for
| proper wear limits? If the latter, what are the limits?
The ball bearing races are unservicable and are replaced as a unit.  
The stub axle that they spin on should be inspected and replaced if 
necessary.  Normally the axle is fine, unless the bearing failed and 
chewed it up.

| Does the 931 race replacement procedure (involving heating the hub
| and using the special tools VW 511, 9154, and P 263) apply to the
| 944/924S hub? Are there shadetree alternatives?
The front bearings and seal are easily done by a shadetree mechanic.  
Have some nice synthetic grease available for the repacking job.
The rear bearings must be done similar to how you describe above.  
Cannot be done under a tree; needs a serious mechanic with proper experience.

| (Massachusetts readers) Can you recommend any machine shops in the
| Boston area to replace the races?
Tony, I'd go to Jerry's (European Performance Engineering) - he has 
lots of bearing experience on 951's thanks to me...

I've got your magazines and the Road Racing World with the locktite article 
(also a good article on how the factory roadracing teams are dealing with 
clutchless high rpm shifting), will drop off when I'm on the hill tomorrow.

Saw Jurassic Park on Friday, definitely a must see...  Will squirm in your seat

Yes.

Fuel filler area, inside rear cargo hold.

My problem was general lack of vapor-seal on the hoses in the filler 
neck area.  It was quite a persistent problem, even though all hoses 
were fine and tight.  This was on a new '83 944.

The neck cover (inside the car) isn't a vapor seal, it's just a 
protective covering.  The point is, your hoses and fuel tank shouldn't 
leak in the first place - thus no need for a seal like that.

If the tank or lines to/from it leaked, the odor would be outside the 
car if your hatch is shut as you drive.  Since this doesn't seem to be 
your problem, I'd say you're in the right area on your car (filler neck).

| d) Do the soft fuel hoses that connect the tank to the the filler neck go
| bad?
Dunno - I suppose they have the same problem any hose has - they get 
brittle with time (ozone), and can be physically damaged.  I've also 
seen many a hose "lose" its seal; the hose loses strength / form around 
the sealing, relaxing slightly and allowing a slight gap to appear.  
This is a *really* common problem on power steering pump resevoir, 
which has virtually no pressure but loves to leak at the hose mounting 
point.  Solution - snip end of hose and move a new section onto the 
part (is possible).

| e) Now for the painful part- How difficult is it to pull the tank?  I 
really don't
| want to go this route, but given my problem, it may be necessary.
I haven't done this, but it doesn't look impossible nor simple.  You 
must drain the tank and be very careful regarding fire/explosion.  
Gasoline doesn't burn, but its vapors do (guess what an "empty" tank 
has in it?).  Disconnect the battery before doing anything!  Prepare 
for downtime, since this job may take more than a day and a view 
special parts (hoses).

| Thanks for any input/help in advance.

Jim,

Depending on what kind of camber, toe, caster and tires, you may have
some cupping and wear that give an audible noise and feel at low speeds,
this is particularly true of Yokohama A008s and AVS tires that are worn
on a car set with negative camber all around. Imperfections from hard 
braking and wear are very noticeable.

Borrow a SET of wheels and tires and try them to see if it goes away.

Hi all,

When I was shopping for Porsches 
a year and a half ago, I saw a 928 in excellent 
condition with a similar mileage 
(86000km= 53500miles) white/white
which was priced at 24000$Cdn = 18500$US.

I offered him 16000$Cdn = 12500$US. He refused.
The guy could not sell it for the next year and a half.
The last time I saw him advertize it, he was
asking 18000$Cdn = 14000$US.

So, if the market in Montreal (CANADA) is 
anything like the U.S., tell your friend that he 
is asking for approximately double the ongoing 
market price. 

Given that I now own a Porsche (944,'86, 64000 miles)
and knowing what the repair bills look like
around this mileage, I think I was stupid to have 
even offered more than 13000$Cdn = 10000$US. 
I am lucky that the guy did not accept my offer.

After loosing control of the car (this weekend)

With my previous used Yokohama 352s, I once did

Bart,

with those kind of prices, I would raise hell if they charged me
for their own incompetence or (at best) mishaps. But be polite 
when raising hell though.
Ask to talk to the owner or manager. 
If that doesn't get you anywhere, threaten them that you *WILL*
call Porsche North America and complain about what the dealer
has done and call the state bureau of better business (or some such
place) and file a formal complaint.
Get the name of the manager and everyone involved also.
(Hopefully you paid on a credit card and can stop payment
on the amount ?)
I've had arguments with my dealer before and he thought he could
get away with it, like he does with the most other people.
Just say no.

Lot of the mechanics at the dealers are fresh out of "school" types,
just learning the ropes. They usually have only 1-2 good mechanics.
The rest are still green in the ears as they say.

The dealers train these mechanics at your expense, so they can save
some money. (Gee, like they need more profit, right ?)

Regarding the front end noise on my 86 Carrera, ther concensus seems to
be a problem with the brakes...either a warped rotor, or dragging pads.
I'd say the rotor could be the culprit due to the sporadic nature
of this annoyance, and also because the noise does not last for a full

Mine was rattling so bad like this I was sure it was just going to break
while I was driving.  Loose especially at the lower right-hand corner, but
also fairly loose at the lower left.

I ended up putting in some strips of 1/4" thick rubber at the top inside,
between the window and the underside covering of the targa bar.  Three
little pieces, two on the outside edges and one in the center.  Worked great
for the noise, but it still leaks like a sieve...

 914 Engine Layout
Hi.
    Would anyone knowledgeable be interested in coming up with an "Idiot's
guide" for the 914?  If such a guide would be available for the 1.8L version, I
would be immensely grateful, and it would even be worth some money to me. 
($20-40??)
    Mostly, I'm interested in some kind of road map and general function
description, e.g., "the Auxiliary Air Regulator is the doohickey over there in
that corner with the three hoses coming out and it looks something like this. 
It gets more air into the F.I. when the Cold Start valve is pushing more fuel
in for warmup."
    If I knew my way around my engine compartment, I might take a whack at it
myself, but .....
    So until I can find one of those, I have two questions I hope you can
answer:
1)  I'm trying to locate the Decel Regualtor on my '74 914/1.8L.  Is it the
wide silver-ish cylinder with a conical end and several hoses coming out (one
of them connects to just past the Air Flow Meter box) that is nestled right
next to my intake air distributor?
2)  What about the Auxiliary Air Regulator?  Is it the (slightly rusted)
narrower cylinder down below the battery?
    I've checked in the Haynes book and looked through my copy of the factory
manual, but I can't find where those should be located in a 1.8L engine.

I should have been more specific - I meant the outer races.  From the
diagram, the 924/931 bearing units appear to be a fairly standard 
configuration:  inner race that fits over the axle stub, and outside
of that a cage holding the cylindrical bearing pieces.  This diagram
also shows that the outer races are separate rings that are pressed
into the hub, one for each bearing.  These latter parts are the ones
that appear difficult to R&R, that's why I wish to know if the 924S has
the same configuration, and if these outer races are customarily
replaced with the bearing units, and whether special tools/procedures
are necessary.

	Howdy all,

	I need to replace the rear pads on my '74 1.8L 914.  I was
following the Hayes manual when I tok out the retaining pins,
and the speader spring.  That all worked really well for a car that
was probably still on the OEM pads from '74.  The problem arose
when I tried to get the piston to retract so that I could insert
the new pad(the outside piston).  The manual said to use a plastic
or wood bar and pry the piston back (being careful off the rotor)
while rotating the hex bolt.  When I tried this, after beaking 
the nut holding the hex screw,rotating the hex screw clockwise
seemed to retract the piston a little bit, while counter clockwise
seemed to force it in more.  But I couldn't get it to retract
enough ofor the new pads :-(.  Does anyone have any suggestions on
how to get this to work????

	I have until Friday to get the car through inspection
again without paying for it, so any ideas would be REALLY welcome.

Subject: Tires


Andre,

Try the new Toyo I 600-F1s. They are much cheaper than the Yokohama 
AVS, almost as sticky, ride better and perform well in snow and other 
moist goo. They are V-rated and run about $114 (US) each from Roger
Kraus Tires (510) 886-4636. Ask for Roger, Joe or Bert.

You can put wider tires, 225/50VR 15 work well, but you should consider 
a BETTER tire first. The guys you've been using aren't the hot ticket
for a 944. My preference for the street is like this:

Yokohama AVS
Goodyear GS-C
Toyo I600-F1
Yokohama A008
Dunlop
Yokohama 509
Firestone Firehawk

I view the Toyos as the best, price/performance considered, use your 
discresion.

Autocrossing, I use A008RTU, they are still awesome for what they give.

If you have only 7" rims, you can gain a lot by going to 8" wheels at 
the rear, I run tire pressures of 34 front and 36 rear also to improve 
the steering. 

The major problem with the Michelins is that the manufacturer uses a 
large amount of creosote as a filler in the tread compound to extend 
tire mileage. This compound acts like grease in wet weather when you 
try turning on a surface that isn't a true asphalt surface. Michelin 
and the cheaper tires available use a lot of creosote to extend tire 
life. More than one Porsche owner has been lured into `less expensive'
tires with grim results.

I usually wait for a couple of days/weeks/etc for the paint to fully cure,
then wax it, then apply the letters to the surface. Of course, I also usually
get to do the paint thing about once every two years, so seldom need to
test how well the letters come back off... 8{P

The decel regulator is the device over near the battery with three vacuum
hoses going to it -- one in each end, one on the side.

The aux air regualtor is sort of a disk-looking thing, with two > 1/2"
hoses going to it, one on each side. There's also an electrical connector,
and usually on the 1.8, a protruding shaft and black knob you can use
to turn the insides. Usually pretty close to the air box (the lines connect
there, one to the air filter, one to the main air body past the flapper
valve).

Good luck.

Subject: 924 Performance Tuning

I don't know if there is much 924 knowledge out there but here goes...

As I am about to embark on a house purchase I'm selling up the car
collection, so the MX5 went last week, and if the advert is any good,
my 6 years of 1977 911 Carrera 3 Sport ownership is about to come to
an end also (sob !).

Anyhow here in the UK, I should be able to pick up a early 80's 924
for about 1/5th of the price of the 911, as money is going to be
a bit short over the next few years, this should have cheap running
costs and still be a good drive (a 914 2.0 could be even better, but a
good rot free one of those is too expensive, as they have become a bit
too 'classic' in the UK). What would be interesting though is any
information on tuning the 924, so I could have a car that would
return some of the fun the 911 has given over the years, but on a
restricted budget. 

I thought that maybe lowering it a couple of inches, heavier anti-roll
bars (would 924 Turbo/Carrera fit), skimming and flowing the head, add
a cam and exhaust......

Any information (or book titles, there seems to be plenty on the 911),
would be most welcome.

Cheers,

This may not be the party line, but some really excellent tires are Bridgestone HP41s.  I run these on my honda (which has seen summit, charlotte, etc) and have had very good luck.  The really good news is that they are very inexpensive.

They are HR rated, which may or may not present a problem on a 944.  They've seen charlotte banking @108 and were happy enough, and that's some serious stress.

This infor may be worthwhile to those or us with lesser cars in addn to Pcars.

My girlfriend is forced by circumstances (the aquisition of a 911sc)
to sell her 951 (aka 944 turbo).

Here are the details:

1987 951

About 56,000 miles.

Very black.  Black paint.  Black interior.  Black carbon on exhaust pipe.
      (what do they mean by triple black anyway?  I get confused on the 
       third black.  Tires?).  Anyway, everything's black.

Well maintained.  Oil changes about every 2000 miles since She's owned
the car (about 2 years, not sure of mileage).

Timing belt (and all other belts) replaced about 8,000 miles ago.

Now for the good part!

Factory performance chip.  Performance similar to the turbo S, 250-260 Hp
instead of the stock 217.

Factory performance 'sway bars.  It's got something like a 30 mm front bar.

Racing Dynamics front strut brace.  I think this is the only non-factory
performance modification.  Simply put, it was the only one available.

One motor mount recently replaced.

Sunroof.

Stereo.

All original components come with the car (chip and 'sway bars).

All work other than things like oil changes done by the Redwood 
Region (PCA) tech chairman (I forget his name, Vos, Vots?).

The car needs nothing except to have the A/C charged.

Asking $15,000 / obo

Call Lois at (415) 927-4682.  You may have to listen to the outgoing 
message 3 times before you get the beep.  Or send me e-mail.  I'll be
glad to attempt to answer any questions.

The car is located in the S.F. bay area, specifically Corte Madera, CA.

Subject: Bearings


Tony,

The bearings in a 4-bolt hub for a 924 or 931 (924 Turbo) are basically
Volkswagen sizes.  The outer races should be replaced at the same time
the inners are done on any wheel bearing replacement.

The late 924S uses the same bearings as the 911 up to 1989, this is the 
same for the 924, 931 w/4 wheel disc brakes and non-turbo 944s to 1986.

All outer races may be either pressed out or driven with a long, fine
tipped punch and hammer. There is a relief in the hub for doing just 
that on all the hubs and one-piece rotors. Always replace the bearing 
seals when doing the inners.

Both inner and outer should be replaced as a set, adjustment should be 
tight enough so that there is no play when wiggling the wheel when it 
is installed.

The outer bearing on all 924/944/968 variants will wear first because
of the load added by the "negative scrub radius" feature of the 
suspension design.

The problem you're seeing is probably the parking brake adjuster. On the
914 rear calipers, there is this screw gizmo on the back of the caliper
(i.e. towards the transmission) that regulates the pad travel for
the cable operated portion of the unit. You have to let that all the
way out to change the pads.  This is talked about in fairly oblique terms
in Section 8.9.12.

And, once you're done, you have to adjust it back to the right place, too.
That operation is described in the 8.10 "Venting Clearance". Nice picture 
(fig. 8.17) showing the adjustment being made. 

Oh, and this is a two-part process: there's a cap over the actual adjustment
screw. It's an Allen screw cap, and frequently strips. One of the more popular
accessory type items for the 914 is new caps, made from stainless, with 12mm
bolt heads. About $15 a set from most vendors (Automotion, Perf. Prods., 
Tweaks, etc.)

You could also have a frozen piston. On cars where the pads have been worn
way down for a long time, I've had them build up corrossion from the 
hydgroscopic nature of brake fluid between the bottom of the piston and the 
bottom of the bore, and require bead blasting and rebuilding.

Aren't 20 year old cars fun?

Steve,

I've worked with the water cooled Porsches for sometime, I'll try to 
point you in the direction I think will work for you in the UK.

All 924 and 924 turbo parts suspension interchange EXCEPTING those on 
Nov 1981 and later (same as 944). Of all the stock swaybars, the 23mm
M471 option front bar works the best. There were 21mm and 22mm front 
bars also. Rear bars interchange on all 924/944 variants, make sure the 
car you purchase has a rear bar or the mounts will NOT be on the torsion
bar tube. A kit is available from Automotion in the US to provide for a 
mounting point. The stock rear bar for the 924 is 14mm( the same for 
the 944). 
Automotion also offers aftermarket swaybars, 28mm front, 19mm and 25mm 
for the rear. These are race quality, very well suited to street/track 
use.

Some advice in selecting a car, Buy a March 1980 or later car, there
were significant changes in the body and quality of assembly. You have 
the 125 HP engine, so the only thing you might want to do is add a 
header. Retain the stock exhaust, as it is much better than any cheap
replacement (more HP). Flowing the head helps, but adding a 2300CC 
stroker kit works the best, you'll have about 145HP and weigh much less than a 944.
If you can find one, some of the cars with sport suspension had 4 wheel
disc brakes, very desireable (I have one). 
I  would find one with 15 inch wheels in any case.

Automotion is at 193 Commercial Street, Sunnyvale, Ca, USA, 94086, phone

The earlier poster described a horsepower improvement with splitfire sparkplugs
and I don't have the post to include it here, but:

I don't want to seem like I'm against something I've never used, but I do
want to see a more valid test done than what the poster described (I may
do it myself after my car is repaired to a certain point).  Some of the
things that also need to be done to prove to the truly skeptical people
that these things produce HP, are: 

 double blind on the dyno: have somebody install the type of plug randomly
 and then leave, and you run the car and record measurements.  Match the
 tests to the plug type later.  People will fool themselves very easily if
 they "know" what they are testing for.

 I'm not very plug-literate, but knowing there are many different designs
 on the market, I would like to know whether a difference in performance
 was due to the "split" or some other thing like core makeup or heat range,
 so what I would do is get 2 sets of splitfires and grind or somehow make the
 split into a normal, single electrode.

If this type of test shows a good result, more people will repeat it, and
if it is repeatable then I'll buy it.

Subject: Sticky tires (no subjective comments included)

Based on testing that I have done on my race car (944 prepared to  
SCCA ITS rules, which means 2535 lbs minimum weight, about 175 hp,  
and tire size of 225/50R15), and based on the results of testing that  
others that I trust have done in similar 944s and RX-7s:

Fastest:
	Goodyear GS-CS
	New BFG Comp T/A

Next fastest (about 3/4 sec per lap slower at 1.5 mile tracks like  
Lime Rock and NHIS):
	Old BFG Comp T/A
	Yoko A008RS

Slowest: (between 1-2 seconds slower)
	Hoosier Street TD
	Bridgestone RE71

The Goodyears and the new BFGs are basically indistinguishable in lap  
times, although if you look at the data cross-eyed, the Goodyears  
might have a slight (.1 sec) edge.  The Goodyears go away after 4  
heat cycles, and by the fifth or sixth heat cycle are as much as half  
a second slower.  I don't know how quickly the BFGs go away, though  
they are rumoured to last longer.

I run the Goodyears because I prefer their "feel" and because their  
diameter is slightly smaller, which suits my gearing better.   
Contrary to what was said in an earlier post, they are legal for PCA  
club racing.  The rules now require only that there be  
distinguishable tread left after the race.  This isn't really a  
problem, because by the time the tread is gone, the tires are no  
longer sticky anyway.

I have no objective data on other tires, though several people I know  
are happy with the Toyo and the new compound (A008RS II) Yokos.  We  
didn't test the new Yokos because the manufacturer said that they  
wouldn't last on our cars under race conditions.

The results for cars with other characteristics will almost certainly  
be somewhat different.  A lot of time and money was invested to yield  
the information above, but your mileage may vary.

Rear shocks are very easy to replace on the 944.  You just remove

It'll take you about 15 minutes per side with manual handtools.

Thanks for your quick reply in signing me up. In response to your

with a porsche industrial engine from Gyrodine (they were used in 
drones around 1960). My 77 911s targa is now a 912e using a 901 
transaxle from a 68 911L and a 1973 914 1.7 engine with origional

of the oil level gauge which I am open to suggestions for a new use
for it. I am working on a closed circuit injection to replace the

I had a problem with gasoline vapors in the cabin of my 1980 931 as
well.  Although I suspected the soft filler hoses for a while, the
culprit turned out to be a pinhole rust-through near the bottom of the
fuel tank itself.  For the first couple weeks, the leak was small
enough that no fuel dripped on the ground, but it shed plenty of vapor
into the air.  The 931 seems to suck air in to the rear hatch area,
and so the normal holes and leaks in the rear of the car were enough
to let in a lot of vapor, whether the widows were up or down.

Removing my fuel tank was not too terrible a job.  I did drop the rear
exhaust to make it easier.

 He could also have too much fluid in his hydraulic system. If you
 have had worn pads for a while and have topped up the fluid level
 then when you insert new pads you will be attempting to increase
 the pressure in the system by hand. Not going to happen. Remove
 the reservoir cap and check the fluid level. If it is topped up
 remove some fluid (an old battery tester is ideal for this - 
 neutralize with baking soda and water and clean before use). Lower
 the fluid level and try prying the pads back again. A good friend
 showed me the nifty trick of just turning the pads around and 
 installing them with metal plates inward (toward one another).
 Then you insert your prying bar (whatever the material) between
 the two pads without damaging the pad surface.

 Note that to get at the venting adjustment screw you may need some
 special tools (like a wobble drive extension). I've found it helps
 to jack up the rear A-arm slightly sometimes to help with the 
 clearance. Of course, the usual disclaimers apply - support the
 car with proper jackstands, etc, etc.

Subject: 914, 914/6 proportioning valve


Hi guys,

I've been reading about the 914 rear pad issue, I want to remind you 
about a seldom appreciated feature on the 914 series, the proportioning
valve that resides on the lower firewall on the driver's side (passenger
side for you Brits) of the car.

When bleeding the brakes or searching for that spongy pedal source, 
bleed all corners as you usually would (rr 1st, lr 2nd, rf 3rd, lf last)
then go to the valve. Have someone pump the brake a few times slowly, 
then unfasten the line on the output side (lines going to rear of car)
until fluid seeps past. Repeat for the input side. This should remove 
any air bubbles in the machined cavity.

To adjust, loosen the nut around the center shaft. Turn clockwise to
bias to the front, counter-clockwise to bias to the rear. This 
adjustment should only be done with all other parts of the system in
correct adjustment and operation. 

One other source of a spongy pedal is the master cylinder, pull the 
carpet back, then remove the floorboard under the pedals. examine for 
an oily residue that feels like brake fluid. The failure mode for the
brake master is usually the seal to the shaft. 

Hope it helps.

I must have missed the original post on this subject, but I am not
aware of any popular belief (is this similar to the much referenced
"conventional wisdom"?) that the 914 can't spin. In fact, the 914 is
among the easiest of Porsches to spin unless you have quick reflexes,
due to the low polar moment of inertia. The latter is due to the
mid-engine design, and is one of the dominant reasons that most
race cars are mid-engined where the rules allow it. The low polar
moment of inertia makes it very easy to rotate the car around a
vertical axis through the center of gravity. This means that the
car spins very easily, and very quickly. It also means that small
steering inputs, applied quickly and properly, will stop the spin.
In the hands of an expert, this makes the car very capable. In the
hands of an average driver on slippery pavement, it means a lot
of spins. I have heard it said that this tendency to spin easily
when driven by average drivers, especially in slippery conditions,
is one of the reasons Porsche has stayed away (so far) from another
mid-engined design.

the easiest things to accelerate out of.  For some reason it always
brings to mind sitting in my first physics class....circular orbits 
and cars in motion staying in motion until outside force gets
involved.
I also know that it is possible to spin a 944 on very hot 
pavement while moving at high rates of speed (ambient temp was 
about 102 F) on those wonderful scenic routes that wind around 
following rivers.  Most of that damage was the rear control 
arm (and the wheel, and the exterior body, and ego of driver).

Thanks Jim, this is very useful my 924 knowledge is very thin, and as
soon as the 911 goes, I will be hunting one down, in a way I'm quite
looking forward to it everything about it is much less expensive so I
feel I can get a bit more invloved and possibly do a little track work
with it. The swaybar suff is most useful as I guess that would be the
first mod, I will get in touch with G-FORCE and see what they have to
offer. If I can get a liitle bit more information out of you that
would be great....

Is this good ?, is a 924 later than Nov 1981 going to have 944 style
suspension parts and thereby allow use of that models uprated parts
(though I would guess the after market bits will be cheaper). ie.
basicly do I want to hold out for a 1982 or later car ?

...errr right post March 1980 should not be a problem, but as above,

This is *very* interesting, I didn't know they did this, I realy don't
like rear drums at all, is there a year, model spec to look for, I've
never noticed anything in the adverts to indicate this option, and
would very much like to go for it if possible.

For me, the main reason for owning a Porsche is enjoyment. You simply
do not enjoy driving the car in the winter. If you plan to keep the car
for a long time, you probably would suffer from higher maintenance cost and
insurance as well as depreciation. Not to mention potholes, low clearance
and salt. No one would want to buy your car knowing that it has been 
winter driven.

Instead of spending about $1500 dollars on winter tires and wheels you 
could pick up a mid-80s VW Golf and enjoy your winter and save your 911s'
heater boxes.

It sounds like the Adopt-A-Highway project that the Golden Gate PCA
region is involved with.  A group of people from a business or
institution work litter patrol on a stretch of road a number of
times per year.  In return, the state erects a sign to acknowledge
the group's 'adoption'.  This was written up in Pano a year or so
ago, and briefly mentioned in this month's 'From the Regions' column.

with  the problems I was having with my '74 1.8L 914.  I tried all the
different advice I got last night.  Unfortunately, none of it worked :-(.
I just couldn't get the pistons to retract.    Since I had just taken
the rear calipers off of the '75 1.8L parts 914 (I was going to use those pads
on the '74.)  I decided to just switch the entire caliper off of the car.

not wanting to come loose)  So, this morning I went over to the state
inspection place, and had them look at the liscense plate lights I had
put on (got a dissaproving look for that since the lights don't match
the bumper), and had him check the rear pad thickness.  After
giving me a hard time about the broken trunk bolts (the trunk
doesn't close) he passed.  WOW, I may have to start locking my 914, as it 
is now officially street lgegal!

My '74 914 2.0's rear brake calibers (definitely the right side, and

I have ordered rebuild kits (please, let them arrive tomorrow in time for

the brakes right now, and then have my mechanic install them and bleed
the system when I take it in for the safety inspection tomorrow.

Anyway, surely some of you (maybe even others beside Stan!) have rebuilt
brake calipers before.  Do you have any suggestions?  Tips?  Things to

I've also got new pedal bushings coming -- is there anything difficult to

Subject: Dunlops


Lee,

Well, that's a good question. 8's will work in the front, the big 
question is with the late wheel offset is whether you have enough
clearance between the strut and the tire. I would mount one and install 
it on the car, putting it back on the ground and checking for both strut
and fender clearance. I would suspect that 225s would be a better 
choice. 

Basically, the Dunlops are a very good tire, check the country of origin
as the German or Japanese ones seem to be better constructed. Since
Sumitomo purchased Dunlop the quality has improved vastly. These are 
first line tires in most situations, just remember that when they wear,
they will have the SAME tendancy that all wide performance tires do in
wet or snowy conditions, the lose some grip. Just adjust the aggresive-
 ness of your driving.

Again, I think 225's will fit, the 245's need to be looked at, I also 
think you would find that the sterring effort and handling would be 
better with the 225s on the front.

|   1) Where is the mileage trip reset switch located?
Is this is an 85/2 car with the new interior, or the 85/1 which is the 
original style?  If it's an 85/2, the reset button is in the vent grill 
immediately right of the instrument cluster.  It's disguised as the 
center vent louver - just push it in with the ignition on and a 
solenoid resets the trip odometer.

If Bentley makes a book yet, that would be a good one to get.  I don't 
think they have one though.  I've heard that the Haynes book isn't too 
good, although it covers the basics (I have a VW Haynes book that I 
don't even use any more - that's a statement about its quality!).  The 
factory books are great if you don't mind spending the $.  Try a better 
quality bookstore for Bentley, or call the publisher in Cambridge, MA.

|   3) Why is my front brake light On. Is this a warning and if so
| 	 how much time do I have to replace it.
Dashboard lamp?  Probably because your brake pad wear sensor has been 
cut, indicating a very low pad.  Check the pads (all 8 - requires wheel 
removal) and wear sensors that clip into the pads.  If any sensor wire 
is cut through, you'll have to buy a new one (~ $18 for your car).

|   4) How can I get an Owner manual for this car.
Contact a dealer, or possibly some aftermarket shops that specialize in 
manuals.  This should be easy to get.

|   5) What is the difference between an 85 and an 85-1/2 944. How
| 	 do one distinguishes this?
The 85/2 is the new interior, HVAC (heating, AC), seats, suspension, 
etc.  85/1 is like the 924 & original 944.

Best thing would be to have someone who *really* knows how to shift, 
show you.  Are you in Porsche Club of America yet?  PCA is a source of 
exceptional talent and ability when it comes to anything Porsche.  I 
can send you info if you'd like.

Basically, the Porsche is a tighter machine that doesn't hide the 
driver's mistakes or roughness when shifting.  I can't diagnose much 
via email, so more seat time and some experimentation on your part will help.

Good luck, and welcome to the Porsche world!

Subject: 911 Shifter question

Was wondering if anyone else out there has seen this or have any comments/ideas.

I have fairly recently purchased a 76 911s.  Sometimes when I shift into 2nd
the shifter binds up, more likely on a down shift than upshift.  Also when 
hot footing through the gears I get a snap/clunk when coming out of gear, this
might be in any gear.  The noise comes from the shifter assembly and not from 
further back.  The noise does not happen every time, just some times.

I have taken up the back plate and found that the couplier bushings have a 
little play, don't really know how much is considered too much.  Everything
else in the back appears OK.

I plan on taking the front shift assembly apart this weekend and seeing if 
anything looks bad.  Mind you this is mostly just annoying but it makes for
slow lap times when the shifter get balky.

Another question:

Anyone know a good place to get 74 style heat exchangers?  All I ever see listed
are SSI's and I don't really need stainless, and certainly not at the cost.
I am not really looking right now, but I know I want to replace the single inlet
setup down the road.  Would like reasonably priced headers with heat pickups
the best if anyone makes them.

Thanks for the help,

Re: exercising the pistons in a caliper.

You might want to rebuild the caliper, if so, this procedure was used
successfully.

After trying the recommended compressed air + wood stop block removal of
caliper pistons, I didn't like the lack of control and the loud pop when 
the piston comes out.

When I rebuilt the brakes on the the 72 911T, each caliper was unbolted,
in turn, but left connected to the brake line.  A large C clamp was used to 
retract and hold one piston.

The master cylinder was used to force out the unclamped piston.  

The piston/cylinder were cleaned up, a new seal was installed and the piston
was re-installed at the correct angle.

The step on the piston MUST be installed at the correct angle for the
pads to wear evenly.  

The process was then repeated on the other piston in the caliper.

I found using the master cylinder to push out the piston was far more
controlled than the compressed air method.

It's wasteful of brake fluid, but it gets the job done, and with
your parts car, you don't even have to take the running car out of
operation.

The recent discussion on list about Dunlop tires reminded me of the
following anomaly.  I recently purchased SP 8000's for my 951S from Tire
Rack.  Since the SP 8000 is available in size 225/45-16, I decided to
order 225/45-16's for the front instead of OE size (225/50-16's)
and 245/45-16 (OE size) tires for the rear.  The rear tires were
manufactured in Japan (which I expected), but the front tires were
manufactured in Germany (which I did not expect).

I like the subjective feel of the new tires much better than the old ones
(Dunlop D40/M2's in OE sizes), but I haven't tried them yet at the track.
I haven't detected any difference in construction or performance beween 
the Japanese and German versions of the SP 8000.  Nevertheless, I still think
it is strange to drive a car with matching front and rear tires made in
different countries.

Subject: Re:  914 brake caliber rebuild?

 I've found it really, really helps to have (1) a compressor with
 air nozzle attachment and (2) a variety of different thickness
 aluminum blocks (more necessary for >2 piston calipers).

 As a rule it is undesirable to actually split the caliper halves.
 I would clean them externally in a solvent bath before attempting
 piston removal. 

 Then place different blocks into the aperture between the pistons
 Then insert the compressor nozzle into the brakeline aperture (surround
 it with a rag to get a halfway decent air seal) and pull the trigger.
 Depending on how good a seal you get you can force the pistons out
 a little bit at a time. Because of space constraints you'll get out
 one piston before the other. Use a block to shut off the cavity and
 try to force out the other piston with air pressure. 

 Time and a variety of small nylon bristle brushes will allow you to
 get most of the crud out of the caliper. Try and use a good solvent
 (SafetyKleen) to make sure that you leave as little deposit in the
 calipers as possible.

 You might want to use a honing stone to reduce any surface pitting
 on the outside of the piston. While you can't reduce blowby from the
 pitting at least you won't slice up your new seals.

 I use teflon sealing tape on the bleed screws as well.

I just wanted to add that the car has about 30K on it and that when
I releases the clutch padel very quickly than none of the problems
I mentioned above are present. By quick I mean as fast as I can

Subject: Re:  Spinning Porsches

 Hmmm.. I should have added a smiley.

 However, I disagree with your assertion that 914s are easy to spin.
 I think they are very difficult to spin. A low polar moment of inertia
 should contribute to a higher degree of traction at both ends of 
 the car. A high polar moment leads to 911 like handling (see definition
 of trailing throttle oversteer). 

 The car does indeed spin very quickly but I think that is a result
 of how many lateral g's it'll take before it does spin. I read somewhere
 that you can get 1.1 lateral g's out of a 914 with race rubber (and
 no other changes). Pretty damn amazing. 

 I attribute my spins to driving hard on wet pavement with poor rain
 tires (somewhat worn A403s - old style).

 The engineer who designed the car said of it that it was a 30% better
 handling car than the 911 (how he came to this figure I have no idea).

you have.  The 85-1/2 has a large oval vent setup that stretches across the

tunnel, with a few guages in it. (i think; i have an 85-1/2).

As the recent purchaser of a 79 911 SC Targa, I am faced with 
my first major expense (other than filling up with gas, yeesh!).
Though one I knew I'd have to take on when purchasing the car, I'm
now mentally preparing to write the (next) big check.  The car
is a dark brown (chocolate) color, but the paint is cracked and
peeled off is several largish areas (all in the back area around
the engine) -- some about 1 foot long by about 2 inches -- down
to the bare metal.

Any ideas why it peeled/cracked in the first place?

I expect that all the paint will have to be scraped (dissolved?)
and re-primed before painting, so this leaves the option open
for a color change.  So I'm open for suggestions... things
to consider
	o	tan interior (carpets and seats)
	o	gold lettering for "Targa" on the side roof
		struts

Around campus I've seen a dark blue, and a dark green that had
tan ints that looked pretty good, I think black would look good
also, but I'm unsure of silver or red.   Ideas?

Any gotchas to the process?  I have a front and rear spoiler, does that 
make things more complicated?

Finally and guesstimates on cost?  I'm figuring with all the dissasembly,
color change, and my pickiness  $1500 to $2K?

You have 915 Disease.  The only known cure is a transmission rebuild. If
it's really binding, then you're already hosed and there's no point in 
taking it apart until it stops working. Then be sure and exchange your
transmission for a high-quality rebuilt unit with a warranty. The cost to
rebuild yours will *FAR* exceed the cost of the exchange.

If you don't like the SSI prices, you *REALLY* won't like prices for new OE
'74 heat exchangers. The SSIs are about $390 a side, wholesale, but you
typically buy them as a "kit" which has all the new oil hoses, sheet metal,
etc. that you need for the conversion, and a new high performance muffler
setup as well, for about $1800 retail. It's well worth it. If you want to
try used, well, there are a zillion Porsche dismantlers, start calling.

There is a small polymer/plastic disc brake pad wear sensor on each wheel.
When the pad wears too thin, this sensors wears. When this sensors gets worn
out, a circuit is opened causing your brake light to come on. THIS SHOULD BE
CHECKED IMMEDIATELY. If your pads are this thin, then you are about to go
metal to metal contact on your rotors. It's possible the pads have been
replaced and they're ok, but the sensor is fairly cheap and should be replaced.

The dash is the easiest way. If your instrument cluster sits under a

I'm sorry, but you're wrong.  The polar moment of inertia is only  
important dynamically, and has no influence on the steady-state  
cornering ability of a car.  It is a measure of the car's inertial  
resistance to torques about the vertical axis through the center of  
mass of the car.  A moment of inertia is for torque what mass is for  
force (tau = I omega dot vs. F = m a).  A car with a low moment of  
inertia will turn in easier and respond more quickly to steering  
forces.  It will, however, also theoretically be quicker (and easier)  
to spin.  Having raced (and spun) 914s, 911s, and 944s, I can tell  
you unequivocably that the 914 is quicker to spin.  This  
characteristic is independent of the "degree of traction" at each end  
of the car.

The trailing throttle oversteer characteristic of the 911s is not a  
result of a high polar moment of inertia, but instead a result of the  
high amount of rear overhung mass.  Any car set up to be quick on the  
track will have this characteristic to some degree, however.

Why should the lateral acceleration have anything to do with how  
quickly it spins?  The word from the design engineers at Porsche has  
always been that the 914 handles better than the 911, the 924 handles  
better than the 914, and the 944 handles better than the 924.   
Prepared to equivalent standards, the 944/968 is clearly the  
best-handling Porsche to date.  Porsche obviously realizes this, and  
will introduce a revised 911 suspension sometime soon (anyone know  
exactly when?).

All I remember about my old 914 1.7l was that it was the type of 
car that I could easily perform four wheel drifts, with
very little steering movement.  The slightest change in the steering
wheel was transmitted directly to the chassis.  Very little fat!
But at the same time the car felt stable....probable because it is wide.
I was always amazed at how well it hugged the corners with the skinney
tires I had on it.   One time a was being chased by a late model 
Corvette on a winding back road and chuckled at how much later I needed
to brake coming into the turns and how I could attack the curves much more 
agressively.  Unfortunately once the road opened up the little 1.7

Bad news Scott, you might get it done for this but I suspect you
would regret it within several years if not hours.

In the UK, one should allow 150-300 pounds for each major panel as a rule
of thumb for Porsche approved paint jobs. I suspect you are looking
at $6000 equivalent for a quality glass out paint job on a 911 anywhere,
maybe a little less in the US due to lower unit labour costs. This is
a guesstimate based a few cosmetic panel resprays on my 911.

I believe the suspension geometry increases the rear wheel's toe out
as the wheel moves down relative to the body (weight
is lifted from the rear suspension when throttle is decreased); oversteer
is not due only to front/rear weight distribution.

The low polar moment of inertia is, to first order, independent of
the relative (or absolute) degree of traction at the ends of the car.
The degree of traction (more specifically the relative slip angles)
are functions of the vertical load on each tire (including any
dynamic load from weight transfer), the angle of the tire to the road,
and the tire characteristics, basically the lateral force versus
slip angle as a function of normal force. If the car has already started
to rotate there is a small contribution to lateral acceleration, but
I believe this is a second order effect. The big effect from polar
moment of inertia comes when the front and rear lateral forces are
unbalanced, and the polar moment of inertia then determines how
quickly the car rotates, either until the appropriate slip angles
are achieved to balance the lateral forces, or until the car spins.

By the way, a better example of a high polar moment of inertia Porsche,
without the large weight unbalance of the 911, is the 944. In the 944,
the engine and the transmission form a "dumbell", which has a high
polar moment of inertia.

I don't think 914's achieve substantially higher degrees of lateral g's
than other Porsches in similar degrees of preparation (stiffness,
tire sizes, etc.). The benifit of the 914 chassis comes from being
able to manage slip angles more effectively very near the limit.

I know a number of other 914 dirvers who have similar war stories of
fast, unexpected spins in the rain, not necessarily with bad tires.

There is a shop near Burlington, Vermont call Restoration

done in this shop. The owner showed me a 328 GTS which
had changed color from yellow to red. I mean every panel was
removed,restored and painted with Glasurit and the finish
was perfect. He said it was an extensive job that cost $5000.
Apparently, some of the Ferrari panels are complex shapes
and difficult to paint. 

Anyway, I asked how much it would cost to paint a 911 with
the same quality without changing the color. He said that
it should cost around $2000-$3000 depending on how much

To be very specific, the membership application has a place to enter
the chassis ID number of your Porsche, as well as a description (model,
year, etc). I do not believe that any check is done other than to
see if the form of the ID number is appropriate for the car described.
I'm not proposing that anyone circumvent the bylaws, of course.

Another possibility is to attend meetings and events as a non-member
until you purchase a Porsche. You won't get Panorama, of course, but
the region president gets extra copies of Pano (or used to, anyway),
and you may be able to talk him or her into a copy for a few months
while you pick out your car. Individual regions may have policies on
this sort of thing, but I know the Jersey Shore region (and I suspect
many others) would be amenable to this sort of thing.

Unless you go out of your way to tell them, I believe things just
coast along, and you can stay as a full member without a Porsche

some of the activities without a Porsche.

OK, I decided to check this out. Here in the Manual of Proceedures (your
friendly neighborhood region officers should have one):

ARTICLE IV: MEMBERSHIP DUES AND FEES

Section 1: Membership

Membership shall be restricted to owners, lessees, or *co-owners* of Porsches
who are 18 years of age or older, and to *such other persons interested in
the Club and its objectives as provided in Section 2 (B), (C), and (D).*
(emphasis mine)

OK, down to the relevant Sections:

2(B) ASSOCIATE - Any active member who ceases to own, lease, or co-own a
Porsche while in good standing, or any person, employed by a Porsche-oriented
business, interested in the Club and its objectives having paid Club dues an
fees as required. 

2(C) HONORARY - ok, this isn't likely...

2(D) LIFE - ok, even less likely (both are given by the PCA Board of Directors)

So: it depends on how you read this. Does "interested in the Club and its 
objectives" modify "employed by a Porsche-oriented business" or does it
modify "any person"? Second item: "co-owner". I sell a guy the seatbelts
in one of my cars for $10. He's now a co-owner, right? Something to think
about...

Subject: 911 hates the rain


I've been experiencing a problem with my '85 911 ever since I got it (about 
a year and a half ago).  In most any wet environment (light/heavy rain, 
post-rain period,etc) the car bucks, misses,coughs, and generally acts up 
about 80-90% of the time.  This situation only exists under load (idle, no 
load, etc.  is fine) up to about 4000rpm, where it wakes up and pulls 
smoothly.  I've replaced the plugs, cap and rotor, adjusted the valves and 
generally have it running really well (in the dry!).  Before I purchased the 
car, I was looking through the records and noticed one for a wet running 
problem.  I believe they either replaced or torqued down the cyl. head temp. 
sensor.  Unfortunately, I bought the car a few months later and this receipt 
was not in the folder of records.  The ex-owner claims that I have all the 
records and that the car didn't want to run at all before the shop fixed it.
Anyway, I checked the torque on the sensor and also the resistance across 
the sensor (hot and cold).  Everything checked out, even when I sprayed the 
sensor with water.  I did the same for the air intake sensor.  The spark 
plug wires don't appear to be arcing.  I've checked at night in humid 
conditions and neither see a discharge, hear a click, nor go into 
fibrillation when I grab hold of one!  I thought it was the O2 sensor since 
 this is taken out of the loop at full throttle (appr 4000rpm) and I had an 
indecisive idle speed.  Replacing this has given me a nice idle but no end 
to my rainy day blues.
The car has 106,000 miles on it, gets about 27-28 mpg, and has easily passed 
two emissions tests.    Obviously, I've learned to cope with this problem, 
averaging 20K miles a year, but the embarassment is starting to bother me a 
bit.  I'm going crazy and running up water bills trying to recreate this 
problem with a hosepipe.  HELP !!! I don't think sunny Southern California

Not really. Those gas struts are sealed units (idiot designers...).
Aftermarket replacement parts can be had for about $60 a pair.

Now if I was designing it, I'd have a tire valve on the side. Any time
it stops holding the hood up, just pull up to an air station, apply the

*********************************************************************

I went to the trouble of measuring the force of a 911 front hood
strut, as I remember, it was about 60 lbs (used), 
about 80lbs (new).  I used a bathroom scale. 

The way the struts are designed, the strut's effective piston area is the 
cross-sectional area of the rod that extends from the cylinder, I would guess
it is about 3/8" in diameter.

so the effective piston area is about

   3.1416* (.375"/2) = .110 in^2

To do 60 lbs means the operating pressure of this worn strut must be about
60/.110 inches or 545 psi.

And a new strut has to be filled to about 727psi.

This is difficult to get out of an ordinary compressor at a gas station. 
They probably max out at 150psi, so you'd have to go to a dive shop.

To use a conventional air compressor a radically different design would be
needed since the current design would need to be considerably larger to use 
normal air pressure.  With the same design, at 80psi, the piston would need 
to be about 1.12" in diameter to achieve necessary 1 in^2 for the 80lbs force.

The cost of the pump up strut would also go up because a manufacturer
providing a pump up feature would probably be required by liability insurers
to put in a over-pressure relief value to prevent someone from hod rodding
the strut.

I have replaced my share of gas-springs, and am currently using the double-up
method on one side of the hood.  

It failed after a year, so I'll try two on the other side.

However, I still think the gas springs are a clever design.

I bought a pair of replacement shocks for $15 each from Zim's. 
I think Porsche charges something like $45 each. You can shove
the hood up with your shoulder (as you sit on the fender) enough
to line up the mounting holes. This was much easier than trying to compress
the shock to line up holes.

The best thing to do is to remove it an install it again using a strip of
good rubber sealant that you can find at your friendly auto parts dealer.
The procedure is very straight forward. After you remove the glass, apply a
rope of rubber sealant all around the contour of the glass and, standing
inside the car (remember to remove the targa top!) position the glass and
apply pressure until it holds. It didn't take me long to do that a couple
of years ago, and it's still holding without any rattles or leaks. Good

All the commentary I've read agrees with the above analysis.
My feeling is that the 928 is just too big and heavy to be in
the same league as the 944/968.  That is not to say it does
not handle well, or its roadholding is poor, which is clearly not
the case.  The 911 is a superior handling car too, but only
if you know what you are doing.  It is entirely predictable,
which is important, but it is not neutral or foolproof, which
must be taken into acccount when discussing "great handling"
cars.

Subject: Spinning Porsches


   The trailing throttle oversteer characteristic of the 911s is not a  
   result of a high polar moment of inertia, but instead a result of the  
   high amount of rear overhung mass.  Any car set up to be quick on the  
   track will have this characteristic to some degree, however.

I just love armchair physics :) Actually the "spinning" tendancy that is
always atributed to the 911's rear overhanging engine is, well not that
simple. It has alot more to do with suspension geometry than weight
distribution. According to Chaparall-builder and vehicle dynamics expert
Jim Hall:
	"In short it is extremely important to realize that a rear
	engine car is not inherently oversteering, that it is, in
	fact, capable of superior handling. Unfortunately, many people
	intuitively, and by hearsay, believe that the rearward

	behavior. This is true only because of the slip angle 
	characteristics of tires. If there were no slip angles, there
	would be no problem. As long as there is a means of controlling
	the slip angle through tire and vehicle design, the "problem" can
	and has been solved."

Or think of it this way: On a rear engine car the centrifugal force
generated in a corner would be twice as great on the 1000lb wheel
in the rear than on the 500lb wheel in the front. But this has no effect
on the limit of friction because the 1000lb wheel is capable of twice
the side force of the 500lb wheel.

Actually, it isn't.  And you don't seem to understand what Jim Hall was  
talking about.  You might want to check a book like Puhn's "How to Make Your  
Car Handle" or Smith's "Tune to Win" for a simple introduction to race car  
dynamics and handling.  I don't want to go into too much detail here, but  
I'll briefly cover the relevant points (much simplified).

The lateral force (or grip) produced by a tire is roughly proportional to  
the normal force (vertical load) at the contact patch.  Unfortunately, there  
are a whole number of other factors as well, including tire temperature,  
slip angle, camber angle, and contact patch pressure (load/unit area of the  
contact patch).  For a given tire, if you double the load, such as your  
hypothetical "1000 lb wheel" above, the contact patch doesn't double, which  
means there is a higher contact patch pressure, which means the grip does  
not increase proportionally to the load.  In other words, all other factors  
being equal, the "1000 lb wheel" will resist considerably less than twice  
the lateral force of the "500 lb wheel."  And the additional grip available  
gets progressively less as you increase the load.

If you have complete design freedom (as Jim Hall did), then the weight  
distribution becomes less important because you can increase the tire  
diameter and width to compensate.  And if you have a very high power/weight  
ratio, you become traction-limited and would tend towards a rearward weight  
bias, with correspondingly larger rear wheels and tires.  See, for example,  
the weight distribution of a current F1, Indycar, or GTP car.

A production car, or a production-based race car, does not have this design  
freedom and is usually limited in the tire and wheel sizes allowed.   
911-derivative race cars have always have the biggest rear wheels and tires  
that could be stuffed under the bodywork (or modified to bodywork to match)  
exactly to compensate for their rearward weight bias.  Unfortunately, as the  
rear wheels get wider and wider, all kinds of other problems crop up, like a  
rear track which is much wider than the front track (bad news for handling).   
Building a race car based on a production 911 chassis requires all kinds of  
compromises, and development is difficult (Stan, am I wrong?).  The  
911-based race cars have been historically successful primarily because of  
their power advantage, and because early on they were racing against even  
more primitive suspension designs (no longer true). 


As I mentioned in my previous message, any car that is set up to be  
neutral-handling on the race track will exhibit trailing-throttle oversteer,  
simply because of weight transfer off the rear wheels.  This can be  
exacerbated by the position of the center of mass, the suspension geometry,  
or many other factors.  Ideally, you would like some controllable  
trailing-throttle oversteer, because it is one way for the driver to correct  
his line through a corner.

Try connecting a simple 12v bulb to the two wires going to the defective 
horn (spade terminals) - if they don't light when you press the horn button then 
the wiring is faulty between the fuse box and the horn. I would guess the most 
likely place other than the horn itself is the big 12(?) pin connector mounted 
on the inner wing on whatever side the defective horn is. This advice is based
on working on my '73 911 - if yours is very different ignore it :-).

I have a perfectly good 914 2.0 except for two problems. The sheet
metal is wrinkled and so is the pan such that the rear wheels track
about 3-5 inches left of the fronts. This was caused by 'spinning
the 914' (see messages of others discussing this phenomena).
Unfortunately, the end result of the spin was contact with the tire
wall outside turn 10 at Sears Point. 

OK, the point of the message. Anybody have a straight, no rust 914
chassis cluttering up their back yard? I can straighten the pan on
the one I have for about $1500 and the sheet metal for another $3000
or so, including complete repaint. I am unemployed at the moment, so
I'm looking for a cheaper solution. I have the time to swap all the

Subject: "Best handling Porsche, etc."


Dear fellow Porschephiles,

If you know me from my 20+ years of being a Porsche fanatic out here 
with Golden Gate Region and Diablo Region of PCA, you'll know I'm no 
shrinking violet when it comes to getting the facts across. 

Point is, it sounds kind of dumb to talk about spinning Porsches and 
which one handles the best. Seems about ten years ago, Tom Green of 
Automotion fame went to some real effort to get his 944 to break 1.0G
on the existing street tires of the day (pre sticky-stuff). He did it
after some extensive modifications to the car. The joke was that Roger
Kraus and I had done the same thing in my A/S 914/6 on Pirelli P-6s in
1979 preping my car for the SCCA Solo 1 series. We didn't think it was
worth the effort to publicize, winning was the true goal (we did).

The moral of this tale is: What ever Porsche you have at hand can be 
made to handle even better than it does, dependant on time, money and 
skill. Don't worry about whether you have a 356 or 928, just enjoy it 
and your fellow Porsche owners. Ask Vic Skirmantis, Chuck Forge, etc.

By the way, a few years back I competed in the Zone 7 autocross series
with the intent of getting a seperate class in production for the 944s 
so we wouldn't have to compete with the big bad Carreras. I figured 
that my showroom stock 944 would get pushed around. Wrong, I won for 
the year and we still have to run with the Carreras. All Porsches have 
a lot more potential than we'll ever need in normal life, we all need 
to study the cars to realize the ultimate potential.

Golden Gate Region PCA does trash cleanup along a section of 280
somewhere north of stanford. Thats probably the sign you saw.

I also wanted to know what type of pads to use for 944. I plan 
to spend some time on track but most of the driving I do is for
the living (i.e. To and From Work). 

I don't know any Cool Carbons manufacture name but I was looking
into calling up Tweaks (800-428-2200) and getting a pair of Mintex
Silver (special metallic compound which is not a semi-metallic pad)
for the front ($39.50 on Sale). 

Is Tweaks (Indianapolis) a good outfit to deal with. They are offering
a free copy of their 17th Edition Catalog ($5.00 value) that I just ordered.
I forgot to ask if the offer PCA discount.

Porschephiles,
My 75 914 has collected a number of problems in the steering column. (1) The
steering wheel ;wiggles up and down 3-4 mm. (2) The big contact finger which
brushes the slip ring on the steering wheel for the horn to work has worn
through and makes erratic contact. (3) The previous owner has munged the plastic
plates which make up the turn signal and wiper switches by overtightening
screws, etc. I have tried to take the column apart, but haven't gotten far.
Procedure is not covered in Haynes. Does anyone have any suggestions on how
to take it apart so I can find out what bits I need? After the steering wheel
is off, I'm stuck! Thanks in advance.

Hello there, my 80-911 recently develops this cold start problem.
The car can not be driven when the engine is cold. I have to put
a light pressure on the gas pedal to keep the engine idle above
1000RPM for about 1-2 minutes before I can drive it. The engine

Check out the auxiliary air regulator. It is a weird looking alluminum
casting about 4" long and about 2-3" high, with 2 air hoses connected,
one going in one end and the other exiting opposite. It also will have
a typical Bosche electrical connector in it.

It is located amongst a rat's nest of vacuum hoses in behind the engine
top, close to the firewall. You may find lowering the engine/trans
will give you enough room to inspect it carefully.

It allows air to pass when cold, similar to "putting light pressure on
the gas". It sounds like it's stuck closed all the time. It's
supposed to close gradually as it gets hot with the assistance of
12V going through the electrical connector. 

One way to diagnose is to disconnect the air lines and run them
together so you effectively take the thing out of the loop and see
if the cold idle gets better, or else just look through the hole and
make sure it's fully open when cold. 

A worse situation exists when these suckers stay *open* which makes
no problem to start the car but a massive vacuum leak when warm. I
think this is the more common failure mode.

Background:
	Last December, my '87 Carrera was broken into via the Driver Side

	I did not notice that the window frame had two gouges/dents

	(No mention from the dealer). I proceded to the insurance adjuster

	I decided to order the replacement parts and wait 'till "more favorable
	weather" to replace the Frame.
	That happened yesterday.

	Upon dissassembly of the door I found several loose (untourqued)

Subject: Spongy Brakes in 911

My 74 911 brakes have been getting spongier and spongier, even after
bleeding. A similar thing happened with my first 911, an 88 Carrera,
and it seemed nothing we did could restore that original firm feel. On
that car, we bled the brakes, replaced the lines (with stainless),
tried 3 or 4 sets of pads (DS11, AF, and Textar), and replaced the
master cylinder. It would improve, but never to its prior, stock level.
Finally, I sold it...  I was quite happy with the non-assisted brakes
on the 74 when I first got it last September, but now that they are
going soft, I'm loath to start another expensive wild goose chase.

Some history: the car is a basically stock 1974 911 Carrera. I drive it
everyday and at local track events. It isn't unusual for me to boil the
fluid at the track. So I have gone to Motul (300 deg C), Cool Carbon
pads, Kool Brake ducts, stainless lines, and no backing plates. I have
the brakes flushed and bled after every event, and have had it done by
two quite reputable shops. But each time it seems they are a little
softer. If I stand on the pedal at rest, it does not sink, so the seals
all seem fine. Is it possible that some air has gotten into a part of
the system that can't be bled? Or that hard use is deteriorating some
other parts of the system? Thanks

Mike

The bulletin simply states that the 944S2 can be fitted with either 
WR 7 DC or WR 5 DC plugs.  Cars which are street-driven and generally
for short distances should use the WR 7 DC plugs, since they reach self-
cleaning temperature sooner.

Spark plugs are commodity items, and any good name-brand part from Bosch,
NGK, etc. will do just fine.  My mechanic friend prefers the copper
Bosch plugs over the platinum ones, although he doesn't feel there is
any great difference.  I think his preference is based on the fact that
the copper's electrodes are harder to foul, but I could be mistaken.

The Splitfires are nonsense as best I can tell.  Two-valve heads do not
have wedge-shaped chambers.

The rust warranty is for rust perforation, not for surface rust.  Go

Check the pedal switch.  On some Porsches and MB's, it is quite easy
to kick the connector off the back of the switch.

I recommend synthetic oil in all 944-series cars which spend time at the
track (driver's ed).  I've seen temperatures in excess of 275 degrees
in my 944S.

(The good news is that I just added an oil radiator.  In thirty-minute
lapping sessions in 100+ degree heat Thursday at Bridgehampton, we think
the oil temp is now down around 235 degrees.)

Use the oil weight and spark plug heat range recommended in your owner's
manual.  Use name-brand oil and plugs.  If you want to learn how to tune
up your car, pick up a copy of the relevant service manual and workshop
manuals from Porsche.

'N' means Neckarsulm (sp?), which is another way of saying "Audi".  
This is the city on the Neckar River where the plant is located.

The warranty applies to rust perforation, so Porsche may not honor 
surface cosmetic rust treatment.  This depends on your local dealer 
liason / rep. and how much they feel like helping you.  Do you have a 
good relationship (if any - new car) with your dealer?

 . . .

Hmm...  That doesn't sound like my '74, but I'll still put in my $00.02....
The wire that comes up through the column attaches to a finger on the metal
ring which screws onto the steering wheel, under the horn button (the center
thing).  There's a bulbous rubber thing that pushes the horn button up and
breaks the contact, stopping the horn from sounding.  You might check the
wire (mine was mis-located and the insulation got chewed up), and also the
condition of the rubber thing.  It might be worn out, which would allow the
button to rock somewhat and intermittently make contact.
There's at least one Porsche dismantler up in Sacto--they had a stall at the
PartsHeaven swap meet.  You should be able to get the works in the center
from them, although they may not be cheap....
Good Luck!

Subject: Consumer Advisory -- Stevens Machining

Just had a good friend of mine pop over since he was in the neighborhood,
who related a tale I know you'll find interesting, and hopefully instructive.

About a year ago, he purchased a set of racing heads for his 1.8 liter EP 914
engine from Stevens Machining, since they were on the short list of people
who know how to do this sort of stuff right. Well, they charged his credit
card about $150 for the core charge, and about $700 for the heads. They then
sent the heads and he was to pull the old heads and return them for the
core charge.

Well, the new heads were *JUNK*. I was there when they came in -- there were
serious mis-machining marks, the valves didn't seat or seal (even leaked SAE 
30 oil when we checked with that!), intake ports were butchered, etc. *NOT*
good. Certainly not what you expect for serious money. 

So he sent them back, they credited him for the core charge and offered to 
try again, he suggested that he wasn't that stupid, and when they refused to
refund his money, he pursued via the card issuer, who credited him and 
eventually recovered the money from Stevens.

OK, it's a year later -- and *THIS MONTH* he gets a credit card charge from
Stevens Machining, for the core charge!!! On investigation, they just sort of
decided to "slip it through" and see if anyone noticed. I'd heard that they
were in some sort of financial difficulty, but  that's just ridiculous!!!

So, two good reasons to avoid doing business with these guys. Just an FYI.

I am curious what people who are racing 914's are using for
differentials.  Open, locked(if so, how), or  limited slip?  How do you
deal with the understeer of a locked or limited slip diff.  Does
anyone have any experience with the Quaife? (I've gotta find some real

The venue I'm considering, believe it or not, is ice racing.  After 13
years, I have to admit that there is no way that I can restore my car
to reasonable street use.(to much rust, to many amateur repairs - by
me)  Ice racing will provide a suitable retirement for the car - I just
can't bring myself to crush it.  A first generation MR2 was fairly
competitive with the FWD cars this past season, so it gives me hope
that the 914 might do OK, particularly with limited slip.

I always used a welded diff in my Datsun 510, but it was a major pain in
the neck.  Great for the straights, but very difficult to turn.  I'm
afraid that the 914 would be even worse.

I use open in my IT racer and welded in the EP racer. The welded diff
is a real handfull, but could be made much better with more engine...
Also use a Quaife in a 911 autox machine. It's *MUCH* better than either
the open diff in my 911SC, or the locked diff in the EP 914.

>The venue I'm considering, believe it or not, is ice racing.  

Cool! I have a good friend who ice races his M5. Not, needless to say,
near Houston... The idea of ice racing a 914 has a certain appeal,
anyway...

You can't autox in a 914 with a welded diff. Period. It just doesn't turn
quickly at all, from differential effect. It's made for sliding the rear
around corners. But then, since you have a little more slip at the rear wheels 
when ice racing, you might be able to make it work out OK. And, if you have 
the lattitude, more power (say, 230+ HP) will make a *BIG* difference.... 
Check your local ice racing rule book first!

Actually, I am one of those funny people who reads the rulebook first.

Ice racing is neat in that the "run what you brung" mentality is very
strong.  The rules are aimed at safety and professionalism, go-fast car
prep is wide open.  I have personally seen: V8 240Z, V8 510, 510 with
rotary midships, 510 with in-line 6 midships, X1/9 with 1100cc Honda
beside the driver, two-door R12 (ie shortened) with Ford V6, and a
beetle with a 2.4 or 2.5 litre type IV.  I have also seen documentation
of a Saab Sonet with 911 power and a CRX with a GM V6.  Some of these
hybrids are remarkably successful, some aren't.  It all looks like too
much work to me.

Obviously, I have lots of options available to me when I need more
power.  I like the idea of a stock Porsche 6, lots of power,
reliability and the car's balance shouldn't be upset.  I also expect a
large displacement type IV would live pretty well since cooling
wouldn't be as large of a problem as if it were running on the street
in the summer.  Does anyone have any experience with large (2.2 and
up) type IV's?

What is the prefered method for welding 901 differentials (what type
of rod, etc) and who is a good source for differentials?

Subject: water coolant additives

(Ugh--not those pesky water cooled car owners again!!)

I drive a 1980 931 daily.  The car always runs hot- although it has
never boiled over, the cooling system is clearly wimpy, as judged by
the swing of the temp needle on hills on hot days.

I've heard of an additive that one can run in the cooling water either
with or (preferably) without ethylene glycol.  The stuff I saw was a
red powder that you dissolve in the water.  Supposedly it had three
beneficial properties:

* It raises the water's boiling point somewhat (though it does not
        lower the melting point appreciably)

* It "wets" the water so that the coolant has better thermal
        conduction to metal surfaces of the engine and the radiator, and

* It does not lower the specific heat of the cooling water the way
        that ethylene glycol does.


Sounds pretty slick to me.  has anyone used the stuff or read about it?
Are there other ways to keep the engine temp down?  The car already
has a small oil cooler

Subject: When a $2 screw costs $400.

My 87 944 turbo has just under 90k miles on it and has been tracked
extensively for the past 2 1/2 years. Until now, it's been suprisingly
inexpensive to maintain.

I forgot to knock on wood. 

Some time over the weekend, the idle set screw worked its way out of the
throttle body.  It's long gone and there's no hope of finding it. No
problem, I think to myself. It's just a little screw. How expensive can
it be? OK, so it's a Porsche part: multiply by 4, but still, it's just a
screw, right? $10 max. 

Hah.

YOU CAN'T BUY JUST THE SCREW! You have to replace the entire throttle
body! Dealer price: $400. PAP (used) price: $200.  Kempton Bros. (used)
price: $85.  OK, so $85 isn't too bad, but I'll still have to
dissasemble the intake system...

Ah well.  I suspect this is just a prelude to the storm.  At 90K, I'm
still running on the original clutch and turbo. Surely, their
replacement is also imminent...

Late breaking possiblity: The local dealer thinks that the 944
(non-turbo) idle set screw (which _is_ available separately!), or a
similar Audi part will fit ($6). Since I don't have the old part to
compare it to, it'll be tough to know for sure.  Has anyone been down
this road before? Jim? Steve?

We've done some checking around on this and have found a place in the S.F.

Total cost $250.00, compared to @ $600.00 for a replacement off the shelf.

This is "Redline Water Wetter". I haven't tried it yet, but there's been
a lot of discussion about it on the hotrod list. The upshot of it is that
lots of people have gotten very impressive results from using it, up to
20degrees reduction in "run-hot" temperature, and so far no reports of
problems. It comes in two versions: an oily solution that includes some
kind of lubricant, and the dry crystals that do not.

> Are there other ways to keep the engine temp down?  The car already

Try a BIG oil cooler. Also, it's possible that the system you have isn't
flowing as well as it should. It is possible to have that checked without
spending too much money on it (less than a rebuild after the overheat...)

Subject: 924 Turbo Cooling


Mike,

I own a 1981 924 Turbo and have had a few things occur with cooling.

First, make sure it's been flushed recently.
Use 20/50 Valvoline TURBO oil or Kendal of the same type. It really 
works and lowers the temperature about 10 degrees F.

Next, get a thermostat and fan switch calibrated for 185-190 degrees F.
This helps the most. 

Ensure you have a 50-50 distribution of coolant to water. Bleed the 
cooling system per the manual or Haynes instructions.

The product you're writing about is made by RedLine and works well on 
track cars, I use it in a big-block Cobra with good results. 

I've stuck with the factory recommended stuff for my car. I still have 
the original turbo and 165 lbs of compression, so I think the switch 
and thermostat will help the most.

On last thing, this applies to all water cooler Porsche owners: Turn on
 the air conditioning on a hot day, set it to the lowest setting. The
dual fans are on when the A/C is engaged, this airflow helps immensely.

We've done some 2.3 and 2.6 Type IVs, but they don't like heat very much... 
If you'd like to talk about having a race-grade large T4 or 911 engine done
for you, Ghost Racing can do it. Shoot me a note off-line. Or if you

discussion on the list...

>What is the prefered method for welding 901 differentials (what type

Hmmm. Best source of diffs is "dead" 901 transmissions. Pleanty of those
around, usually $150-450, depending on how good the rest of the gears
are. If you shop some, you can find 912 and early 911 transmissions, 
which have different gearing than the 914 had. Buying one of those, grabbing
the diff for your welded unit and keeping the gears to customize your
ratios is one of the smartest things you can do. Call your local Porsche
dismantler to see if they have any laying around.

As to the welding process itself, I don't know. The ones we have were done by
H.G. Bieker Engineering, back before we bought the car. BTW, Galen Bieker
is one of the "good guys" in the Porsche performance world. He's never done
anything for me (nor apparently for a number of other folks out there) that's
less than absolutely perfect.

Anyone with an '87 951 should be able to measure the screw for you
(pitch, diameter, length), and a good metric screw and tool place
should have a screw readily available for $0.75 or so that will work
just fine. If "you just gotta" have Porsche original parts, though,
good luck. Maybe you should try one of those Porsche boneyards we keep hearing

Anyone with thoughts on what I should expect to spend?

The dash I've currently got is not real bad, no cracks. It
is warped a bit around the defroster vents and the center
air vent. Also, the previous owner must have had very long
finger nails. There are a bunch a scratches behind the top
of the steering wheel.  Obviously I'm only interested in
something in better condition.  No cracks, no warps, no
scratches, etc...

I suppose I could go for a color change, however, I'd also

Larry and other interested parties:

The 916/6 Flywheel is identical to the 911 2.0 flywheel with the 
following exception. All of the timong marks that are on the front
crankshaft pulley are in the flywheel. This is because the pulley is
almost impossible to see in a 914/6, so there is a port between the
transcase and the engine case that the marks can be observed from on 
the flywheel. 

By having all of the marks transferred from your original accurately, 
you should be able to find a much cheaper used flywheel. Make totally
sure ALL marks are transferred, the 120 degree marks and all advance
(timing marks)

I am in the process of putting dual electric mirrors on two
older (69 ,72) 911T's.  So two sets of "incomplete" 911 dual
mirror kits were purchased from two dealers.  

  Incomplete =  No switches, No wire harnesses, and No instructions.

The shop manual illustrates where to cut door holes, but 
my latest electrical diagram is for the 82 SC.

My factory manual doesn't answer all my questions, so maybe
someone can help.

A. Where is the "mirror change over" (right/left selection) switch
   physically located?  The only description for the location I found
   was:

   "right/left switch in the instrument panel on the surface below the
    combination instrument and slightly inboard of the ignition switch"

   The combination gauge refers to the oil pressure/temperature gauge? 

   Could someone improve on this description?  The rectangular
   hole size can be determined from the switch.

   More specifically,  

     1. From the vertical sheet metal panel that supports the
        gauges, what is the distance from this surface to the
        nearest edge of the installed switch.

                         |  <---- gauge seats against this surface

Subject: Re: 911 dual mirrors

     Before you go to the trouble of cutting the dash to install
the left/right rocker switch, consider this observation.  My '83
SC has dual electric mirrors.  The view from the right mirror
left a serious blind spot.  A car could be sitting with it's
front bumper even with my back bumper (in the next lane to the
right), and I could not see it in the mirror, even with the right
mirror adjusted as far out (to the right) as possible.  I finally
purchased a stick-on wide angle overlay mirror which solved the
problem.  It was made to fit the Porsche mirror, and looks
original except for being convex.  With this installed, I leave
the mirror adjusted  to the right limit, and can still see the
reassuring bulge of the fender flare in the near corner, so no
remote adjustment is required.

     The only disadvantage of this solution is that I expect the
mirror defroster doesn't work well through the overlay, but
that's not a problem in San Diego.  I saw the ad for the convex
mirror in Panorama.

     I would recommend wiring up the joystick to the left mirror
only.  However I can measure the location of the rocker switch if
you like.

Subject: Re: Lease Termination.

Mike,
	You inquired as to the availability of exceptional bargains at the
	Porsche dealer, due to returned lease cars.

	The sales price and the asking price are two different things! 8{>

	Seriously, what it means is Porsche Leasing overestimated the resale
	value when they computed the buyout price at the beginning of the 
	lease.
	The lease company, has the local dealer offer the returned car for 
	sale, at local pricing, "high Blue Book". The dealer has to make 
	something to pay for his sales effort, so the lease co. probably
	can't expect more than local wholesale (low Blue Book) for his 
	returned car.
 	After 30 to 60 days, if the car doesn't sell, the lease co. probably 
	will sell the car at auction, or to a dealer at wholesale 
	(low Blue Book) to minimize his "flooring cost"(Time value of money 
	invested in the car.)

	If you hold a lease that is about up, offer something higher than 
	low book, you are likely to be accepted.
	No bargains at the Porsche dealer due to lease returns, as the local
	market determines the price today. My lease buyout price was set
	6 years ago. So all it really means is I get to buy my car for a 
	price that is "fair", as opposed to an unrealistic value determined
	by the market conditons six years ago.

	Long Story made long:
	I purchased my car five years ago, as an early lease return.
	Now here is where the bargains "might" be found! Do your own
	calculations to sastisfy yourself!

	The Original lease holder returned the car early and got no money
	back, (In this case a hefty down paymnet to bring the monthly	
	lease price down to what he could afford). I picked up the car for 
	a minimal front end cost, and carried the lease to completion.
	The buy out cost at the end of one year (when I bought it) was 
	essentially the same as the  car's original purchase price, 
	Approx $36K. (loaded 87 911 Carrera with 8 K miles).

	I did some calculating, five years ago, which "conviced" me that 
	I was spending less money, to take the lease, and buyout the car 
	at the end of lease, than to take the car at full asking price 
	with minumum down payment.
	I still think I did OK, as the loan rate I'm geting now is 6%, not 16% 
	and I got the buyout price reduced by 12%.

	Remember,"I'm emotionally attached to my car!" 

	If you are really lookin for bargains, look at regions which are
	ecomonically depressed. The local market determines the "selling
	price", remember Econ. 101? The Porsche market is changing whether
	"we" like it or not.

Yes, Galen Bieker does fabulous work. He is building my cousin's
914-6 race car. From test runs at Willow Springs, it will have
no problem setting the lap record for its class.

Galen also works on my car. No engine work yet, but he did a
great job lowering my car. He was the one that got me to put
8" and 9" Fuchs on my car.

Okay, torque is measured in length times force.  Therefore,
it is not length divided by force, mass divided by length, or
anything similar.

Can anyone tell me what size the 914 bumper bolts are?  I was about to

It is very close, if these calculations are correct

  1 lb = 454 grams = .454 kg

  1 ft-lb = .454kg * 12inch * 2.54cm/inch * 1 Meter/100cm = .13838 kg-meters

  Since F = mass * acceleration   

    in this case acceleration = gravitational constant = g = 9.8 m/sec^2

    newtons =  mass (in kg) * 9.8 m/sec^2

  
  so 1 ft-lb = (.13838kg * 9.8m/sec^2)-meters


  1 ft-lb = .13838 kg-meters = 1.356 newton-meters

If you're going to use the Haynes as your principal source of repair

I would assume that the turbo and aspiro set screws are the same, since

etc.

Moreover, they keep telling people to go put stainless steel/teflon
brake hoses on their daily drivers, and how much they will improve pedal
feel, etc.  Dangerous bullshit, period.  In one such article, they also
sang the praises of Castrol GT/LMA, and, wow, Automotion (I think) just

The dry form we got includes a water pump lubricant.  I called Redline,

I haven't used the stuff yet.  I've done a number of things to make my

air radiator.  I need to re-install the oil temp sender, then do a few more
track days with the current configuration to get data points.  I'll then
try the water wetter and see how things change.

I did give one of the bottles to two other owners at the Bridgehampton
race, one a fairly stock 944S and the other a, um, highly non-stock 951
("The Beast").  They both were running hot, used the stuff, and felt it
helped.  I didn't get really quantitative answers from them.

Subject: Porsche Cold Start Problems

Folks,

Last night I picked up the July issue of European Car and
guess what? The TECH PROCEDURE article (page 96) describes
the auxiliary air regulator, why it's necessary, and how
it works.  Also there's a section on trouble shooting the
little bugger.

I too recently experienced this problem on my 911SC. In my
case the blocking plate on the auxiliary air regulator was
sticking.  It was not open enough when cold so I needed to
nurse the gas peddle for a couple minutes until things got
warm.  Once warm the plate was sticking in the open
position which resulted in a high idle (~1600). In my case
I did not need a new regulator.  Jerry (at EPE) did an
"adjustment" which took about 10 seconds.  I wish I had
seen exactly what he did to the regulator since the
pictures in July EC don't show anything which is adjustable.
In any case, it's been a couple months now and the problem
has not come back.

Regards,
Mark

Another factor in a 13 year old car could be that the radiator is 
gummed up internally & externally (clogged fins), so the thermal 
transfer rate is reduced.  You may also have a defective thermostat 
(maybe you already tried that avenue?).  Lastly, the engine itself may 
have an insulating coat of gunk within it, causing poor transfer into 
the water.

What's hot - the engine or the water or the radiator?  The answer will 
highlight your problem area (hot engine, cool water says water pump or 
engine water galleys).

I agree about the stainless-steel brake hoses, which just caters to  
their typical reader's interest in a cheap go-fast (or in this case,  
stop-fast) secret.

However, Kevin and I disagree about Castrol LMA brake fluid.  I think  
it's the best thing since sliced bread, and use it in my race car.  I  
have yet to experience brake fade while using it.  This may be  
because I have good front brake cooling and replace my pads when they  
get about half worn, but I have several friends who also use it in  
their race cars with no problems.  Since it costs about 1/3 as much  
as the more exotic fluids, I completely flush my brake system with  
fresh fluid before every race, which costs me about $5.  If I was  
using the expensive stuff, I probably use it more sparingly.  The  
high boiling-point fluids are much more hydroscopic as well.

Of course, you'd be crazy to buy Castrol LMA from Automotion, since  
it's available at most of the discount auto supply chains.

Subject: 916/6 Flywheel


   Larry and other interested parties:

   The 916/6 Flywheel is identical to the 911 2.0 flywheel with the 
   following exception. All of the timong marks that are on the front
   crankshaft pulley are in the flywheel. This is because the pulley is
   almost impossible to see in a 914/6, so there is a port between the
   transcase and the engine case that the marks can be observed from on 
   the flywheel. 

   By having all of the marks transferred from your original accurately, 
   you should be able to find a much cheaper used flywheel. Make totally
   sure ALL marks are transferred, the 120 degree marks and all advance
   (timing marks)

Whoops! Are you sure???

While it is true the 2.0 914 flywheel is similar in appearance and the
stuff about the timing marks is true and both are 215mm with identical
ring gears, they are not interchangeable because the 914 2.0 flywheel
has a different mounting to the crankshaft. The 2.0 6 cylinder crank
uses 6 bolts and the 2.0 4 cylinder uses 5 bolts. I haven't looked at
a 4 banger crank lately but I think this is the case, Stan care to
confirm? 

The only other flywheel that I know which *is* interchangeable is the
'69 "S" 2.0 which will bolt up but the timing marks will be *totally* 
screwed up which you can live with.

My take on Kevin's point is how the article appeared to be blessing a 
product without reservation, and that an [expensive] supplier /

purchase!  Sounds a little too cozy for my liking.

LMA is a great street fluid and works in lighter cars on the track (I 
still think my '83 944 had better OEM brakes than my 951).  I still use 
it, but not in my heavy, poorly-braked '86 951.

Is there a better or preferred brake fluid that I should be using? What's

I thought that Low Moisture Absorption brake fluid was a good idea since

Case in point. The article was specificly on how to install the front bar on 
a 914. It stated (paraphrased) that the 914 really needs a front bar, and
you should put on a big one. My experience is that the front of the 914 
is *REALLY* stiff, and that if you have a stock engine and only street-
grade tires, if you put on even the stock factory bar, the 914 plows like
a John Deere.

The stock 914 really needs the *REAR* bar, not the front, until you start
setting up the car for racing or autox in a class where you have significant
engine modifications *AND* sticky tires.

This bit of misinformation may cause people to go out and drop $300 for
a Weltemeister (hmm. don't think they had anything to do with the article,
do you?) 19mm bar only to have their cars just skate off the road because
they're understeering so badly. *NOT* good.

Now, if the article had been clear as to the circumstances under which you
need the bar, and had maybe even done a compare and contrast between the
factory bar, the Weltmeister bar, and the H & H bar, I'd have been a whole
lot happier with it. As it is, I think the magazine's tech editor needs to
do a *LOT* better job.

Just an FYI. And it *IS* a good magazine -- just don't believe everything
in it!

Yes, I know of the problem.  I've remove, dismantled, cleaned and
reassembled the switch and replaced the fuse.  The problems is
still there.  Another member in our region tracked the same problem
to the micro switch in the roof.  It's in the center where the
roof pivots with the body.  

To test this, use a very small screwdriver and try to trigger

Hello water cooled fans and fanatics,

I know no question is a dumb question, but you all might think
differently after this one.  Since I like the "what does it look
like" kind of questions and answers, here goes:

While searching around in the rear hatch (84 944) checking on some numbers
for Affie, I discovered a loose connection.  But I can't figure out
where it goes.  The rear hatch light is on the left side.  It uses
the black, red, and brown/white stripe wires.  In the same group
(bundle) of wire is a brown, black, green group ending with a white
cylindrical piece with four cylindrical bored areas.  Three of the
female receptacles contain metal (no, I don't know what kind).  Where
is the other end of this connection, and should the fourth receptacle
have metal in it?  

This is what happens when aero-mechanical types start messing with
what appears to be the electrical engineering area.  I've looked in
Haynes, (remembered college) and decided to seek the wisdom of the
net.  If the solution is "left to the reader as a simple exercise"

Subject: Re:  stainless steel brake lines

 All kind of things. They are (1): very easy to damage, (2)
 high maintenance (must be checked frequently). If you bend the
 line (kink it) you can seriously weaken the Teflon (tm) core
 and then you risk catastrophic brake failure at some time in
 the future. The stainless sheath will abrade anything it
 comes in contact with and yet does not, itself, withstand
 abrasion very well. Should a strand come loose it could 
 pierce the Teflon core leading to catastrophic brake failure.
 You cannot inspect a stainless line visually - there is no
 real way to tell whether it has been kinked (say during 
 installation or maintenance of calipers). A classic problem
 occurs when people allow the caliper to hang by the brake
 line. No problem with rubber lines and mucho problem with
 stainless lines.

 Stainless lines were developed for use in aircraft (aluminum)
 fuselages. As such, they were tougher than the surrounding
 airframe and if anything gave it would be the airframe (better
 than loosing control of your control surfaces). This is not
 the case in cars.

 In my sphere of racing (bikes) I advise everyone to use great
 care in use stainless lines. Personally, I've converted to
 using Frentubo (Italian) Kevlar-shrouded lines. They give the
 same or superior feel to stainless and don't have the drawbacks
 associated. Cost is equivalent. 

 YMMV.

The 944 parts fiche shows the 944 idle adjustment screw apart from  
the unit and with a separate part number.  The 951 unit does not call  
out or show the idle adjustment screw separately, nor does the 944S  
unit.  Based on how Porsche generally does things, I don't think the  
adjustment screws would be the same.

Also, based on the (admittedly rough) drawing of the part for the 944  
unit, it is reasonably complex.  If the 951 screw is the same, it's  
not going to be a matter of buying a metric screw off the shelf, but  
rather having the piece made up.

This is a great car!  You should expect very high reliability, since 
the 968 is based on the 944 which is based on the 924 from 1976.  If 
you put the car on the race track (which many voices on this wire do) 
then the reliability will be lower, of course.

I also agree with Nathan that Castrol LMA makes more sense for most
applications. I am intrigued that Nathan changes it for every event,
since to me the most significant benefit is that it maintains a good
boiling temperature over a longer period of time. The only way to
gain the benefit of the ultra-high temp. fluids is to change them
very frequently (argueably every event), which is expensive, but
also less likely to happen in anything but a serious racing program.
I believe that the original post was discussing street cars, possibly
under high performance conditions, where monthly brake fluid changes
just aren't going to happen. Under these conditions, Castrol LMA
(or at least that type of fluid) is the clear choice.

I also wouldn't buy it from Automotion, based on the price.

Speaking of this this type of article...
I became very interested in the article 

in last month's EC about the Autothority software in an RS America
that was being club raced.  I've been considering buying the mild chip 

(pump gas) but am skeptical about the trade-offs of doing this.  I'm not
particularly interested in voiding the warranty, but I could use a little
more torque at the low-end for autocrossing.  Does anybody have any
experiences chipping 3.2's or 3.6's?  Any info would be greatly
appreciated...

FYI...
A local
PCA club racer sucked a valve during an event in his RS while running the
race chip (spring retainer failed) only to find out later that Porsche had
published an internal memo stating that stronger spring retainers need to
be installed if running the motor at the upper limits with race software.
Needless to say, he managed to get PCNA to eat most of the repair bill but
not before they argued a bit about how the warranty excludes "racing" of which
PCNA also includes autocrossing.  Perhaps I was naive to think that Porsche
still built off-the-showroom race cars :-(.  Sounds like they forgot "Race
on Sunday, sell on Monday".

I believe this statement holds true for any magazine for that matter.  The
mag's are all in business to sell advertisements so their clients can sell
product.  Unless your big enough to piss-off a client by writing a less
than stellar review of their product and not take a big hit, it's not
realistic to expect them to be TOTALLY objective.  Hence, I rely upon 

this group on the net and other PCA members to confirm/deny the mags claims
with real data before I buy.

The wire is probably for an option you don't have.  Do you have a rear 
wiper or electric sunroof?  Answering no to either gives you a likely 
candidate!  Don't worry about it.

The missing connector pin is normal - the nylon connectors are made in 
standard sizes and Porsche just didn't have a use for the 4th hole.

I believe that the original problem was a flywheel for a 2.0 L. 914/6,

No. I believe they are available (from talking to the folks at

So I think you should be able to acquire them from some supplier.

Eeeeep! Eeeep! Eeeeep! (that's the opinion alert sounding...)

It also has *ALL* of the maintenence issues associated with the 944. That
means (based on my experience) that it's about 3x as expensive to maintain
over any reasonable period as a 911, particularly an SC or post-'84 Carrera.

If you want a good measure of what you're in for, call several different
service providers and ask for quotes on all of the scheduled maintenence
items (i.e. the 15k, 30k, etc. major maintenence), the annual tune-up,
replacing the water pump (hey, that's a tasty job...) and replacing the
clutch. Just to name some of the things that are going to cost *A LOT* 
more than you're expecting.

BTW, I highly recommend that anyone do that for *ANY* car you're contemplating
buying. Can be a real eye-opener, I guarantee...

>> to GET ot not to GET ...
>GET IT!

Your call, guy. Obviously, none of us picked out these cars based on
anything in Consumer Reports... I say go with what your heart says. As
an FYI, if you get a 911SC in "sad" shape, around here you're talking
$10-14k. Then if you spend another $4k putting it into spectacular mechanical
shape and pretty good cosmetic shape, you'll have a car that you can sell
again in say three years for probably $10-14k... If you get any new
car, you'll take a *HUGE* depreciation hit as soon as the tires hit the

Yeah, well, I continue to disagree with you, Stan, regarding maintenance
requirements and cost, 944 vs. 911.  I work on both, and I can't say that
one is 3x or 2x or even 1.5x the difference in maintenance time and costs.

I've lost the original message.  If we're talking about the adjustment
screw in the throttle body housing, the part numbers are:

  944, 944S: 930.110.919.00, cost about $5.60
  951:       951.110.919.00, cost about $2.50

I am pretty sure these are the right part numbers for the cars.  The

No, we agree.  If you can get away with it, more power to you.  Great
stuff; I recommend it and use it in the street cars.  My comments were
simply a cynical remark regarding European Car's editorial style.

I'm a firm believer in Don't fit it if it isn't broken, and brakes are
included.  Example: AP introduced last year a six-pot calliper for use by
the F1 cars.  Most of the teams, perhaps all by now, upgraded to them.
We went to the F1 race in June in Montreal, and scored pit/garage passes
and a guided tour of the McLaren and Ferrari garages.  Yes, I died and
went to heaven.  (We also got thrown out of the Williams and Benneton
garages!)

The interesting thing was that all the cars we saw were using the
old-style four-pot AP callipers.  Why, you ask?  The Montreal circuit is
comparatively easy on the brakes.  The four-pot callipers weigh less.

Subject: Question on chassis number of '67 911 (early short wheelbase model)

Dear Porsche lovers, 

My friend in Tokyo has bought '67 911 (early short wheelbase model) from US, 
and soon it will arrive at Yokohama port. This car is informed as S-model from 
the dealer, and he noticed us its chassis number as 30599S ("S" at its end !)
and engine number as 960343. 

However, in the pink slip which we recieved recently, it is shown as 305999. 
This difference made us confused, and might cause some troubles at Japanese 
custom and registration. Much worse, some literature shows that chassis 
numbers of early type 911's start from 30501 (five digits), another shows 
that they start from 305001 (six digits), and both shows S-model has "S" 
at the end. 

We thought two possiblities (we have not yet seen its actual chassis number):
[1] 30599S is correct : Probably on the registration, "S" was misunderstood 
                        as "9". 
[2] 305999 is correct : Probably the car has converted from non-S model to 
                        S-model specification.

We would appreciate very much if anyone could inform us any opinions/ideas. 

Thanks in advance,

Subject: Flaming 914's


I thought I might relate a story which I found amusing, as told to me
by a Porsche mechanic about the early days of the 914:

This guy said he was working as a fledgling mechanic at some
dealership in Colorado in the early 70's when a trailerload of shiny
new 914's arrived. After they were unloaded he was told to set them up
in a row and begin to prep them for sale, and let them all idle for
awhile. There they were, all bright and smelling like new cars, a row
of orange, green, yellow, lime, silver put-putting under the golden
Rocky mountain mid-day sun. (You get the picture). Well this guy
walked away for a few minutes and when he came back they had begun to
self-imolate, that is start up on fire, one lighting up the next in
the row, one by one. By the time the fire trucks arrived they had all
gone up in smoke. I guess incidents like this one prompted the fuel
line recall campaign...

Does anyone else have any flaming 914 stories? I have two others which
I will tell you about as long as I hear one from you. If I hear no
others I will tell you anyway, you can not escape them. (unless I am
in your killfile already).

Strengthening the anti-sway bars will transfer more force into your 
chassis, exacerbating the loss of structural integrity.  Generally, 
"softer" chassis should have softer suspensions.

Unfortunately I haven't had the time to rip things apart to test all

if I am listening to a weak radio station (and aren't they all weak on

Oh yes !
My sunroof started acting funny about a year after I got my 944
(second hand). I had it fixed once by the dealer, which replaced
a couple of plastic gears in roof which tend to loose teeth very
easily.

The problem is a fundamental design flaw in my opinion
(by the way, the 968 I think has the same sunroof design ?
not sure though)

The sunroof gets stuck to the molding around the roof cutout. If
you don't use the sunroof most of the time or don't clean the
interface between the molding and where the sunroof sits on top of
the molding, the sunroof gets stuck to the molding and makes it
hard for the sunroof mechanism to push the sunroof up.

Now, the sunroof is pushed up with two curved pieces of metal
that are inside a gearbox mechanism, inside the back of the roof, 
one on either side. There are two white plastic gears that turn
and push these metal pieces out and these two plastic gears are
turned by a rotating metal rod that is turned by a motor
installed in the the rear driver side compartment behind and to the
left of the rear hatch carpet.

The problem is that when the sunroof gets stuck to the molding,
it represents a load to the metal pieces and the plastic gears
tend to loose several teeth when you press on sunroof switch to 
push it open. By the time you figure out what happened, it's too late.

I've changed the plastic gears in my car myself a couple of times;
they are cheap, I think about $2.00 each. And it takes about 1/2 hour
to replace them and you only need a phillips head to do it.
But the rotating rod mechanism in the rear must also be adjusted,
which I have tried but haven't been successful. The 944 workshop 
manual is not at all clear on how to do this right.
It isn't apparently a trivial thing to do and needs more than 1
person to do it. I haven't tried it lately, but I may try it again
someday. For now, I just don't use the sunroof.

I think that the prospective purchaser was looking at buying
an almost new 968, so I would expect maintenance to amount
to very little except for routine service and consumables.
The real cost of ownership with a very new 968 may well be
depreciation.

I think that compared to a 911 at a similar price (in the UK you could
probably get a 911 C2 with 30-40k miles for around the same price
as a very new 93 968) the prospectiver purchaser will be paying
out more on the 968, the depreciation alone may be greater in comparision
to running an older 911 plus depreciation.

road trip in my '70 International Orange 914, I backed into my parking spot
at the apartment, killed the engine, got out, and decided to center the
car up  in the slot. Upon atempting the restart, the engine wouln't catch,
and being a curious mechanic I opened the engine lid, finding the engine
covered with fuel. An injector hose had failed, squirting all over the
engine when the key energized the fuel pump, fortunately the injector rail
pressure never got high enough to allow the engine to start.

	A second near fire incedent was averted a few years later, when I
replaced the battery, and was cleaning up the mess of corosion under the 
battery support, I noticed the nylon fuel supply and return lines were
severly crazed. Upon removal, these lines fractured into many pieces, and
most likely would have failed while running, causing the infamous flaming
914. I replaced the nylon lines with copper.

	I saw any number of charred 914 engine compartments at the dealer's

Mine was one of the engine fire ones.  The guy I bought it from stripped
it to the bare body, repainted it underneath and in the engine compartment
with some kind of epoxy enamel, added fender flares, and repainted the
body,  While he was at it he added 911s front susp & Brakes, 914-6 rear
susp & brakes, and much much more.  The moral is - if it hadn't had the
engine fire it probably wouldn't be around today, and definitely wouldn't
be the car it is.

It's not just the last year or two -- as Stan says, the vast majority of

Subject: 924, 944,968 longevity

Hi Guys,

I'll put my $0.02 in on the 968. I've owned and maintained my own water
cooled Porsches for 15 years. I have seen, with proper maintenance, 924s
and 944s hit 200,000 miles on many instances. The clutches and gearboxes
in good condition also. The key to any Porsche (and any car) living a 
long time is proper maintenance. Kevin Gross will probably agree.
Conversely, I have seen all cars looking like a piece of s*** in a year 
with and owner who dosen't maintain it.

I think the 968 will give over 200,000 miles of service with minimal 
risk just by observing the maintenance manual and changing the oil at 
3,500 mile intervals. The mechanicals are very improved over my 1983
944, all of the original shortcomings in pumps, motor mounts and timing
belts have been resolved to the point of not being a major concern. The
968 motor doesn't share very much with my 1983, the block is improved,
the head is better, motor mounts are different, clutch stronger, 
different gearbox, etc. It looks similar but isn't, like a Carrera 2 and the preceeding Carrera.

As for water pumps and Porsche as a design group, they had a lot of gall
dumping the 1970 911 clutch design on us, the 1973 911T mechanical 
injection, the entire 928, 944 engine mounts, leather dash covers for
early eighties 911s and the most unresponsive customer service 
organization I've ever seen.

You will note I still own three Porsches, the people I meet and talk to
(E-Mail) help find ways to get past the shotcomings of Porsche's fine 
design team and make the marque a lot better.

I purchased my 944 from a young fellow that thought the slight bad 
vibration in the engine was bad engine mounts. I purchased the car, 
pulled the head off to fix the bent valves and decided to fix everything
that could possibly go wrong. That included the clutch, gearbox, water
pump belts and so on. The bill for parts caost me $2,300 on top of a 
purchase price of $7,500 three years ago. I have autocrossed and time-
trialed the car with minimal maintenance, easily comparable to my 914/6
which was retired when I found too much rust from the battery in the 
right rocker panel.

It's easy to forget that Porsche has had 30 years to finally get the 911
to a point of being bullet-proof. I remember the days of sweating the 
ticking timebomb of chain tensioners after an autocross. It took 22 
years for Porsche to get the Carrera tensioner design to us. We have 
a few more years until they have the bugs out of the 944/968 motor by 
that indicator.

One of the bitches that I have about the water coolers is that Porsche 
always has waffled on their legitimacy, despite their being totally 
involved in the design and execution. They seemed pleased with the cash-
register results while nickel and diming the improvements.

So much for my grousing, if you want a Porsche, just pick one you like 
and go for it, I'll be out ther rooting for you to have a good time 
with it.

I think that the prospective purchaser was looking at buying
an almost new 968, so I would expect maintenance to amount
to very little except for routine service and consumables.
The real cost of ownership with a very new 968 may well be
depreciation.

I think that compared to a 911 at a similar price (in the UK you could
probably get a 911 C2 with 30-40k miles for around the same price
as a very new 93 968) the prospectiver purchaser will be paying
out more on the 968, the depreciation alone may be greater in comparision
to running an older 911 plus depreciation.

WOULD LIKE TO KNOW:

Is there a clear benefit in purchasing or leasing (48 months) is the way to go 
with a car that is depreciating faster than 911 for example is to lease and
give the bank allow the bank to assume the risk for faster depreciation?

More importantly what is the "KNOW" on the new 1993 968 for relaibility and
no down time at the dealer 'fix this'...

I've got a similar FI system on my '75 VW Superbeetle, and yes, the
pressure relief valve on the flap (that plastic or rubber insert) 
does pop out for backfires.  I had the same problem with bad hoses
going to the decel valve.  Fixed the problem, but the box had already
been damaged.  I couldn't find a part to fix this (used duct tape for

w.r.t. flaming 914s, how about this one...
I had my 75 1.8 in Providence RI for a year (first mistake)
In the spring, I got it running and after a week or two of
good service, parked it for 5-6 days. Got a call from the fire
dept at 3 AM who wanted to know if I was the owner of a red 914.
It caught fire in the middle of a rainstorm. Near as I can tell,
the fuel pump relay shorted out and got things going. Fortunately
the car was in a parking lot directly across from the fire dept which
kept the damage limited to the engine compartment. Sure burns hot,
though!

The RS America *is* a US-spec car; the Carrera RS is not.  It's 
confusing, but these are different cars!  Saying a car is a '93 "RS" is 
not sufficient to identify it as either model, so we need to be more precise.

Well, the shop manual and the Haynes book for the 914, and the "Bosch FI" book
from Bentley all say the same thing:  Replace the unit.  Do not try to rebuild
it yourself.  I guess that the spring is rather delicate or some such....

The good news:  PartsHeaven out in Hayward is starting a program to sell
re-built units, so to get a supply of cores they are selling new ones for about
$185, with (I think) a $50 core charge.  Not too awful--AutoMotion wants
something like $250 for a new unit.

The micro switch is at the front of the sunroof.  This generally has been
a problem with the raise and lower functions.

As for releasing the roof, I had to ask another PCA member for help
with mine: you see, it's all in the key position - the VERY FIRST position
on the ignition is what you want (read the owner's manual VERY carefully).
The person who showed me was very happy to help; he had the same problem
when he bought his 951.

Subject: misc. 914 and 944

Hello gang,

You know it is a good day when there are 41 messages in your mail box.  

On the subject of 944 sunroof problems, sounds like I've got lots
of company.  Setting aside the mechanical and electrical problem
for a while, has any one replaced the weather stripping that is
around the sun roof?  Thinking about getting the parts and doing
it myself, but would like to know what I'm getting into first.
Until I am sure the other aspects (mechanical and electrical)
are going to be fixable at reasonable cost I won't even attempt the
weatherstripping.  Is the micro-switch that is being discussed the
rocker-switch on the console or on or near the roof?  Or is it the
relays in the rear wheel well?

Another 944 question, does anybody know how to simply fix the
window control switch?  I am referring to the rocker switch on
the door.  The passenger side works from the driver side control
panel, but not at the site.

On flaming 914 stories, remember too that the injector O ring can
fail and cause leaks even if your fuel lines are okay.  I had
one fail (after replacing the fuel lines twice) on moving day,
just as the movers were attempting to get the 914 into the van.
The day we replaced the injector, the next one failed.  I am
seriously considering replacement of the other injectors just
as a preventative measure.  

On the discussions of water-cooled vs. air-cooled, I haven't heard
any one mention "lemons".  Paul is the original owner of his 944,
and he has maintained his car.  But, the water pump, the radiator,
the broken rear differential pinion and ring gear, the engine
mounts (three times now), the slave cylinder on the clutch (three
times), power steering hydraulic leak, the sunroof, the rear hatch glass 
problem, the switches, the non-adjusting clutch, etc., are 
things we are living with.  The 914 we obtained in 1988.
Fortunately the fuel pump had been relocated, but we still
had to replace the fuel tank, lines, etc., clutch, pushrod tube
seals, pulling the engine for everything, and are still 
trying to get the parking brake working, the windshield re-installed,
windshield washer working, and fighting the never ending rust
problem.  What I'm trying to say, is we all love our cars or
we wouldn't be talking about them, driving them, and modifying
them.  It is unfortunate that emotions are at cross purposes with
economics.

Exactly so -- why on earth would you WANT to do 911 head work
with the engine in the car? It's so easy to pull, and it's such a
delightfully attractive chunk of mechanical art, I'd like to pull
the engine just to LOOK at it. Oh, by the way, now that it's out,

No, but my 911 doesn't have a torque tube either, like the 944. Have

Ah, but you so rarely need to remove a 944 engine, that's the beauty.  You
can do the bottom end and the top end with it in the car.  Moreover, the
engine comes out the top, not the bottom, I believe.

The leather dash in my '77 9ll is suffering from the same shrinking diease.
I believe this the the reason Porsche stopped offering leather dashes sometime
in the mid 80's.  I think you can get the dash recovered as long as the 
material under it is not too badly warped.  The people at Alan Gun Leather 
used to recover them or at least sell the kits (800-875-0606).

BTW, I was told recently that the leather covered 911 dashes have the 
original vinyl covering under them.  Does anyone know if this is true?

Mizuhito -

I know nothing about this stuff.  So I'll try to answer the question for
you.  According to Porsche Cars of North America's 1993 Fact Book, the
engine serial number 960343 would come from a '67 911.  That car would
have had a chassis number in the range 305101 through 307350. There was
an "S" appended to some other '67 cars' chassis numbers.  However, they
all started with a six-digit number, eg, 305101S.

Brett Johnson, in his "The 911 & 912 Porsche," gives different information.
According to him, a car with this engine was a Model Year 1967 car
manufactured in 1966.  It would be a 911S, engine type 901/02.  The
chassis number would be numbered in the range 305101S through 307360S.
Johnson's information is more detailed, and I would tend to trust it
better than the PCNA Fact Book.

One thing your friend can do is contact the Porsche factory for the Cardex
information on the car.  He should be able to get correct chassis and
engine numbers from the car itself, and the Factory can verify whether
or not the two were one at birth.

Subject: Hello

Hello,

I recently purchased my first 'real' car:  an '87 944 Turbo.

I have a few simple questions:

What do you use to maintain the exterior/interior of
your car?  (ie. soaps, waxes, leather treatments ect.)
If this has been discussed at great lengths before, just point
me at the correct archives.

The owner's manual seems to be fairly particular about anti-freezes,
oils, etc. and what properties these should have.  Unfortunately,
the manual doesn't go into great detail:  it just tells you to talk
to your Porsche dealer - which is ~70 miles away for me and probably
under water right now:)  Any suggestions?

What is the difference between a 944 Turbo and a 951?
I've been reading this group for 2 weeks and still haven't
figured out if there is any difference.

A more serious question:  The other day my glove compartment filled
with water.  The water was very cold, so my first thought was that
it was condensation from the air-conditioner.  I haven't been able
to determine any more yet.  Ideas, suggestions?

Thanks for any help, in advance.

Nothing like starting at the top. It's too much trouble to do
that every time. Besides, when the posting covers multiple cars,
such as using 911 parts on 914s, or is of general interest, 
such as upcoming events or cleaning injectors, how do you
handle it??

I'm looking at some other options on how to get the volume managable.
In the meantime, the best solution is to get the digest version and

I guess it's time to float this past this group as well...

I have a car for sale, and have a friend who has one for sale as well.

Mine is my '81 Euro 911SC Targa, 226K KM (~137K miles), currently leading
the Lone Star Region autox series in P7 (stock late 911s). Second overall
in P7 in '91 (behind Joe Wilkinson who took 3rd in AS in Salina), didn't run
'92 due to travel schedule.  Driven daily, est 15k miles a year. Has
A/C, stereo, alarm, etc. in addition to some interesting tweaks.  Send me 
mail for details if you're seriously interested. Comes with second set of 
7&8's with BFG R1s, records for the last 5 years, records for the first
owner (in German log book, no less!). $14,500. Can arrange delivery.

The other is a '68 912. Fresh *HIGH* performance engine (~120 HP),
fresh suspension, brakes, interior. Gulf Orange. Needs a drivers side
floor pan (est. $500 to fix), has some dings and chips (est $1200 to 
fix, including the pan). Professionally maintained by factory trained
(yes, on 356 and 912) mechanic. Asking $7,500 but that includes fixing
everything. Price is probably negotiable. Contact me for more details
as I'm storing it for the owner.

Nope. Just helped do a full rebuild. The motor comes out from the top,
*IFF* you do it piece at a time. (i.e. ancillaries, then head, then
block.) It *MOST EMPHATICALLY* does not go back the same way. At least,
not without removing the radiator and most of the front end. 

And the factory manuals say "insert from bottom" and there's a special
tool you can get from Assemacher AG that fits on a floor jack just for
inserting 944 engines (used with a lift, but hey...)

BTW, it took nearly as long to get the engine back in the car in one piece
as it did to disassemble it piece at a time. It was *NOT* a fun experience.

I did it as a favor to a friend, but like the last time I helped this guy
with a 951 clutch, I've learned that once is about twice too many times...

It depends. In the car, I pour about 1:4 xylene in the gas tank, but then
I don't have to worry about cooking catalytic converters. BG also makes a
*VERY GOOD* product, and the LM product called "Ventil Sauber" is also good.

Out of the car, I have a pressurized pulse stand that I run trichlor or

Subject: 944 Breakin Via Door Handle

Hi Everyone,

 Today I had the dubious pleasure of chasing a would be radio and/or car
thief with a makeshift cudgel after witnessing him break into my 944S.

 Afterwards, I noticed, upon close examination, that the perpetrator
utilized his screwdriver to poke under both door handles to release the
lock (leaving gaping holes in the door skin (and, later, his skin too)).

 A long while ago, I recall reading about a product in VW & Porsche
magazine that allegedly prevented this means of gaining access.  Some
chromoly (chromium-molybdenum) plates or something that could be used on
924s/944s/VWs.  Unfortunately, I dismissed that ad at the time because I
was quite familiar with the boulderdash that gets printed in that rag.

 Has anyone actually used this device?  If so, is it effective?  More
importantly, what is the address and phone number for the manufacturer(s)?

 I carefully checked my other cars.  Fortunately, it seems that neither
the 928S, 535is nor 300D suffer from this particular vulnerability.  The
former two having a "deadbolt"-type feature.

 Unfortunately, that has meant glass replacement and meticulous cleaning
being necessary as a result. (the BMW having been an extreme example of
that, but that's another story)

 Difficult choice.  To fix or not fix.

 May you all safely avoid NYC and its vicinity,

      Lee

Sounds high to me. BTW, *NEVER* buy a 911 (or any Porsche for that matter)
without getting someone else -- mechanic, or knowlegible friend -- to give
you a second opinion. It's too easy to be swayed by the "love affair" factor,
or to miss stuff that you might have caught had you looked closer.

Subject: S/S brake hoses

I made a statement about "stainless steel" (steel-braided teflon) brake
hoses being bad a few days ago.  Stefan neatly summarized a number of
the reasons for such a statement.  I posted some time ago an article
Bruce Anderson wrote for the Dec '91 Excellence.  Here it is again:

(Dom: forgive me for filtching this.  I hope it induces everyone to
subscribe to your excellent mag.)

_________________________________________________________________________

A Word of Caution About Replacement Brake Hoses

Stock rubber hoses are fine for a street car.  In fact, I prefer them. 
They are a low maintenance item and very seldom fail.  Their most common
failure mode is swelling from old age or contaminated brake fluid.

The Teflon braided hoses are designed for race cars where they will
receive heavy maintenance and frequent inspections.  All of the successful
race cars in the world use these braided steel hoses.  However, if you get
an inferior product, or if they are improperly installed, you can create a
worse problem for yourself than the one you think you are solving.  There
is probably no more frightening experience than having brakes fail, so be
very careful and check out the fit of your aftermarket brake lines very
carefully.  If one fails, the results can be tragic.

I know, I know, a lot of people use steel lines for their street cars.
If you feel you must switch to the Teflon braided steel lines, be sure
that they are dash three size hoses.  The dash for size that was some
common a few years ago on the aftermarket actually causes a spongy brake
pedal.  When you install stainless steel brake lines, make sure they match
the same position and follow the same lay that the original rubber lines
did.  Lower the car after you are done to inspect the lines making sure
that none of them are in a binding situation.  There should be some slack
in the brake line in every condition.  If there isn't slack, reposition
the line until there is some.  Recheck the brakes lines after you have run
the car for a while to make sure the lines are free and not kinked.

The problem that I have seen with these brake lines over time is that they
become stiff and try to loosen themselves up and cause a leak or become
brittle and break where the fittings are swaged on.  I have seen and/or
heard of quite a few of these braided steel Teflon brake lines failing over
the years and I only remember seeing one stock rubber line thathad failed
so I have to recommend against steel lines for street use.  For a race car
they are fine because race cars receive a very high level of maintenance.

_________________________________________________________________________


I would add that you should check the lines from lock to lock, on the
ground, at at least try to imagine addition slack needed as a corner would
be loaded out on the track.  Have a friend double-check.

If you secure the front s/s hoses to the strut with cable ties, be sure to
first wrap the s/s hose with, say, a section of slit fuel hose.  The edges
of some cable ties are very sharp and will wear quickly through the steel
and Teflon.

In my track experience, changing to s/s hoses netted me absolutely zero
benefit.  What has helped is:

 - use the brakes less,
 - brake cooling scoops and ducting,
 - higher temp brake fluid,
 - pad compound choice,
 - sufficiently thick pads and rotors,
 - front/rear proportioning valve adjustment (esp. in 914's),
 - eliminate knock-back from pad taper, loose bearings, and
 - bleed, bleed, bleed!

My personal set-up right now is stock callipers, Cool Carbon blue pads,
AP 550 fluid, and Holbert Cool Brake coolers.  This is on a street 944S
which has not be lightened.

Use a phosphate-free anti-freeze.  I don't know what auto parts stores
have these days; perhaps they carry such a product.  You can get the stuff
at a competitive price from VW/Audi (Autobahn product line), Mercedes, and
either Saab or Volvo.  Mix 50/50 with distilled water.

Same car.  951 is the factory project number for the 944 Turbo.

'84 944 Guards Red...  109k Tranny Differential Tooth busted...

What's the prognosis gang?

The box is open and sitting at the mechanic's.  The clutch is also at 90%.
He said the rebuilt tranny was $2250 with 1yr warranty pts & labor.
A used one would be $1250 with 3mo warranty parts only.
The clutch recommendation is replace: approx $970.
The tranny work:  $650 labor

I've taken great care of the car which means most everything else has been
replaced already inc: motor mounts twice, cam belt three times, water pump,
clutch, seals, brakes...

Low blue book is $5950!  High is $9050.  Total repair with a used tranny would be
around $2850 not including my driver's side window regulator and guides, another
$400 right?

So we're looking at giving up the car versus having a go.  I haven't done a
valve job yet either which runs about $1500 right?  It looks I am almost rebuying
my car.

Any ideas?  Keep, sell, you want it?  You want to trade?  Know of any buyers?
How long has your 944 lasted?  How many miles?

Any info would be greatly appreciated.

That sounds like Armor Door Plates from M.L. Hill International.  Phone

  This is probably true.....however for those who don't know trichlor
is nasty stuff and one should take the proper precautions not to
breath it in.  This stuff can collect in the liver and cause health

I work in the aircraft engine industry and we use Trichlor for cooling

If your question pertains to a fuel additive (versus a spray or dip cleaner),
I recommend Chevron's Techron (no, not because I work for them)... Through my
own experience as well as friends (plus a little inside info). The fuel
additive really works. The compound is a Chevron developed product that is
sold to many other major oil Co.s as well as additive marketers for rebranding
into there own product lines. If you want to be sure of what you're buying,
get the Chevron branded stuff.

By the way, follow the directions exactly -- this is not a case of "more is
better". The effectiveness is actually REDUCED if too much or too little is
used. Also, if your deposit build-up is bad, you may need more than one
treatment. If this is the case, do not treat successive tanks. A reaction is
started with the first treatment that will continue for several tanks of
non-treated fuel. Best is to skip a few tanks in between treatments...

By the way, Porsche recommends Techron by name.........

You don't save much on the clutch job labor wise. My clutch is at 77k

He should have also replaced your motor mounts with the new style which

Depends on what you want to do with the car, if you like it, it still meets your
driving needs, and the repairs are less than what it would cost to replace it
with the same thing, then keep it. Otherwise, well....part it out? Sell body

     buy another 930 and put the rims & tires I purchased on the new car.
     this wont happen in the near future.

Are the stock ones any good for racing??

Leads me to ask the group if anyone thinks it's feasible to replace the main
and rod bearings in a _931_ without pulling the engine?  I'm looking at a
situation where the bearings (but not the crankshaft) are pretty heavily
scored, leading to some really low oil pressure readings.  The rest of the
block and the rings seem to be good (140psi compression, no oil consumption),
so I'd hate to pay someone $$$ to pull the whole thing just to pop in $100
worth of bearings.  Any thoughts?

Subject: 911 Salvage Title

Hello !
	I'm looking at picking up a project car to do a complete rebuild to,
and have pretty much decided on a 1978+ 911. The rebuild would include a
conversion to a convertible c2 turbo look. Since most of the car I will be
chopping up - I've pondered whether a salvaged title 911 would be all that
bad. I have a line on a 1979 targa - hit hard in the front that would be
cheap. I have access to full frame straightning equipment,mig etc so the work
does not bother me. The question I have is whether even if the car is
completely and professionly rebuilt, would a prospective Porsche buyer be
put-off by a salvage title. I would do a step-step photo shoot of the rebuild.

	I think 60 Minutes did a take on salvage titles that killed their
resale value. Comments/Opinions appreciated...

Seriously, I'm out in California, in the SF Bay Area.  The regs are rather

_no_limit_ on what you must spend to make the car comply.  Basically, carbs are
illegal, without special dispensation or a Smog Check mechanic who doesn't pay

Subject: Self-service 928


A fellow wrote about purchasing a 928 and doing all the work himself,
a little something to be aware of:

The four-cam 928 motors must be removed from the car to remove the heads
and perform any upper-end work. The 2-cam 2 valve heads are removeable 
in the car. This operation is about a 10 hour job each direction for the
four cam car. They are very cheap when they require engine work.

For the people that wonder about which way the 924/944 etc engines come out, the drivetrains are installed from the BOTTOM of the vehicle on 
the assembly line, this is why certain locations can never be accessed 
in the car. The 924/944 engines will come out of the car from either 
the top or bottom of the car, remembering that there are a number of 
items which must be disconnected and/or removed in either case.

Have fun!

I'm not sure what state you're in.  In MA my 70 914 has been exempt from
smog testing for a few years now.  I could get it to pass though, although
in MA the fact that I've changed to carbs is not a problem.

Regarding FI vs carbs, my problem with the FI is simply that mine was so
old.  I think that if everything works perfectly the FI may run better
than the Webers, although I'm not quite sure of the top end power.  Would
definitely run better in various anbient conditions.  With all those 20+
yr old gizmos and hoses, I doubt whether my FI could measure up to the
carbs without a serious amount of attention (read time & money).  For the
few hundred bucks and days worth of work to put the carbs on, the car has
been a completely reliable performer for the past 8 years.  Besides, I
love the way they look, the way they sound, and the feel of the throttle
response.  Very different from FI.  More like the way I envision a 356 to
drive.  just my opinions, though.  Either way, a fun car.

I recently purchased my first 'real' car:  an '87 944 Turbo.

I have a few simple questions:

What do you use to maintain the exterior/interior of
your car?  (ie. soaps, waxes, leather treatments ect.)
If this has been discussed at great lengths before, just point
me at the correct archives.

Re cleaning materials: For the Rubber work (spoiler, bumpers, window trim, 
mirror trim etc) I have found Maguire's Mirrorglaze 40 to be excellent. I 
have an 84 944 that has spent all it's life in the Arizona sun and the 
spoiler etc still look brand new.  This stuff doesn't coat like some of the 
popular pruducts, it just conditions and restores.  Works great on vinyl

Subject: 924 Turbo Bearings

RE: Paul's message of 19 July.

Paul, pull the motor. It's a time-consuming, but not too difficult a
process.

You will have to disconnect the bell housing to remove the clutch and 
flywheel anyway, it's easier to pull the motor with the crank and 
everything in it. The issue here is that your crank is scored and needs 
machining. You will find that the top land on your piston is probably
distored from the heat and there are scores in the cylinder walls. The 
oil pump also has to come off. 

A more pleasant note, if you remove the engine and do your disassembly-
assembly outside the engine, the turbo stuff goes on more easily. Trust
me on that one. 

There's more bad news, you'll want to find out where the particles 
came from, just pull it down and check your cam and followers and 
examine them for wear. You'll also notice wear in your valve guides.

you'll lose the bearings in short order if you just do just that. No one
said these things were cheap and simple.  Do it right and you'll be
rewarded with a nice running car.

If any one else is reading, a 1979-80 924 turbo can be enhanced if 
you're about to rebuild by using the 81-82 8.1:1 compression pistons.
They cost the same, you get more in town driveability because of the 
half point of compression.

Subject: 914-6 evaluation?

Hi all,
Last friday I got a chance to look at an original 914-6. Original
owner, paint, interior, engine, etc. 67K miles. I drove it a bit,
but the engine pinged at anything over half throttle from 2-5K RPM
(loudly), so I didn't get a chance to evaluate performance. The
tranny was very vague shifting (compared to my 75, anyway), but the
synchros appeared OK. Now the questions... Given that my interests
are performance rather than originality, what does an original have
to offer that a conversion won't have? (apart from a heater). Asking
on this car was $15K, and I have seen a number of conversions in the
$7K range. Benefits including sideshifter, newer interior and choice
of motor in an already debugged package (vs doing the conversion
myself). Is $15K for this car reasonable? I see it asked a lot, but
what are these cars actually selling for?
Thanks for your thoughts on this.

OK so now I know the front 8x16" are worth $150 each
But for the 9x16" "pretty valuble" is a little vague.. $300 each?? 5, 6,

                 Limited slip:  Front/Rear Sway Bar
Wheels:          7x15

                 205x50x15's
Comments:

These tires are incredible!  I'm a YOKOHAMA Fan, but these tires are Very
fast. Comments have been made about the way the feel mushy upon initial
turn in (you turn the car in- then the tires react comments...)  Well, I
think the secret to these tires is running the right sized rim for the tire
mounted.  In the past, I would have mounted these 205x50x15's on a 6" rim.
This would have given, as "The Real" Roger Johnson commented: "... the car
would turn in then the tires would catch up!"

Having mounted them on 7" rims, this really stretches out the tire and makes
the side wall very square... This greatly improves the sidewall stiffeness
and make turn in response, IMHO, quicker than the RSII's!!!

And, on top of this, the learning curve for these tires is very steep(quick)!
In no time, I had an in-experienced, never have AX'd, beginner driving the
car at its limit, **SAFELY**, with incredible car control!  I got in it
and drove immediately, what I feel, quicker than my RSII's.  I then took
the car out for some HIGH SPEED (read:tight Mountain switch-back's) and found
them to be very forgiven at the limit and definitely easy to 'read' at this
limit!!! I did get the front to break away slightly, but it was easliy
brought back into shape by simply modulating front tire loading (squeezing
the brakes slightly to transfer load to the front of the car).

All in all, these tire are, simply put, incredible (and,after 130 miles
of low speed/tire scrubbing and high speed drifting: the tires are not
even broken in yet!! See my comment on Ken Mitchel's wear data at the
Wendover NT event using 224's!!).

It could be an interesting '94 if BFG's AX compound tire is as good as
their current RR (224) tire, just much stickier (and I hope they solve
their wear compared to the RSII's!!!!!).

I'll use these at Driver's schools at Portland/Sears/Laguna Seca/Seatle,
as well as a few AX's until I get the October '93 release of the AX
compound tire.  Then I'll do a comparison with my RSII's (still VERY,VERY
fast with GREAT WEAR(!!!!)), so I'll keep you all informed (if you care!)

G'day:

Subject: Another 944 engine mount woes

While changing the front brakes pads last Sunday, I noticed  oil
on the right-side steering linkage rubber boots. I have not yet
verified whether it the engine mount or something else that is
leaking, but considering the 944 engine mount problem, I suspect
that to be the case.

So before I go and replace these mounts, I wanted to get some
wisdom from porschephiles.

    - What is a quick way to verify a bad engine mount beside the 
      obvious oil leak?

    - What is price & part number of the upgraded engine mount, are
      these only available through dealer or can they be purchased
      elsewhere?

    - Should I replace both mounts or only the defective one. (I
      recently got this car and don't have the maintenance record)?

    - How many hours of job are we talking here for a one or both
      mount replacements?

    - Any comments on the do's and don't about this job?

    - Brief list of tasks to be performed to do the replacement. I
      ask this because I couldn't find it in my Haynes Manual and I
      don't have the shop manual yet?

I  know this is a long list of questions but I also, know that most
of them would get answered. To save the net bandwidth you can mail 
the response directly to me.

Answer is: (come on everybody...) "it depends". First things first -- if you
don't have a Hunter or Bosch frame machine, and the factory measurments for
re-aligning the tub, forget it. I've been through this on my personal car. You
can't pull it out "close enough" like you can on a Chevy truck or something.
It pretty much has to be on the money, or you lose *BIG TIME* when it comes 
time to set up the suspension. This *IS* a very high performance sports car,
right?

Second, dealing with a car on salvage title. There is, in most states, a 
mechanism for moving a car from a salvage title to a "real" title. You should 
check with your DMV about that proceedure. Doing this typically involves a set 
of state inspections, to make sure that they're not giving you a title for your 
refrigerator or something. Once you have a real title, who cares? *EXCEPT*
that one of the first questions I ever get asked when selling a car (after "how
many miles does it have") is "has it ever been wrecked?" How you answer that
is a matter for you and your consience. I have always told the complete truth
on my cars.

Third, value. Here's the *REAL* "it depends" part. Ghost Racing raced an MR-2
that we bought on a salvage title, rebuilt, re-titled, and after its retirement
as a competition car, sold it to our crew chief who has put another 30k miles
on it. No loss of value, because it was going to a knowledgible consumer. We
also have a 911 that was the 1990 SCCA Solo II champ in F Prepared. It's 
built out of two different tubs, welded together. On a salvage title. There's
probably $15K + just in the engine, another $4k or so in the suspension
and wheels. It is *NOT* street legal, nor could it be made street legal. But
what's it worth to a competitor? For that matter, is it worth anything to a
non-competitor??

Where you lose on value is when you try to sell the car as a "perfect" or
"near perfect" car to an ill-informed consumer. If I knew a car had been
in a heavy collision, it would not deter me from buying it -- but it *WOULD*
change the way I investigated the car. I'd want to have the tub checked, to
inspect *ALL* the mount points for suspension and drivetrain, to check the
fit and finish a bit closer, etc. And if possible, to talk to the guys who did
the work if I didn't know them. Then I'd pay a fair price for it. However,
if it didn't pass my inspection, I wouldn't buy it. And a bargain basement
price wouldn't make any difference at all.

Finally, conversions and updates. When you change the car from stock 
configuration you have truely stepped into The Twilight Zone. There is 
*NO* rule for value, *NO* benchmark, *NO* standards. What you can get
for a "conversion car" is strictly a matter between you and the buyer.
I've seen people lose their ass *BIG TIME* on such deals. For example
we joke that the VP of the local Porsche Club has the "Worlds Most Expensive
$8,000 Car". It's a '69 911E that has been, ahhhh, modified. To look like
an early 70s S, with a fake Marlborough Racing look, a tail that could have
never come with the car, a bizarre custom interior (including alligator 
inlays on the dash!), an "updated and modified" engine, polished and chromed
wheels, etc. I really don't know how much he has in it, but I do know

*THAT CAR*. Then who knows what it's worth? He's turned down offers in 
the $20k's, but on occassion has tried to sell it in the $15-18k range
and failed. Must vary with the wind, etc. 8{)

The exceptions to this rule are conversions to factory spec for that
model, e.g. putting an electric cab top on a '87 targa, using all factory
parts in a manner that is indistinguishable from a factory installation. Then
it would be treated like a factory cab, value-wise. Of course, there are
*STUPID* things you can do that way too -- I know of a pre-A 356 that was
in very good all original condition which was hacked to add a factory sunroof
top clip, and new paint and interior. Value dropped precipitously due to
destruction of an original car in original condition.

 If you have heavily scored big-end bearings then you should ask yourself
 where that material (that once was part of the bearings) has gone?

 It generally trashes your oil pump and ends up in the pan's filter
 screen (after having trashed the cam tower bearing surface as well).

 I'm afraid that your only sensible option is a complete strip-down,
 check and re-assembly. Otherwise I think you're driving a timebomb.

1-800-ADP-LOCK.  They're called Armor Door Plates, and they're well worth
the money.  Any water-cooled VW owner can tell you...

These are much better than the other versions.  These are not just flat
plates; they have flanges that go into the door so they can't be bent and
the screwdriver cannot reach the release lever, and they're made of
hardened steel.  Others are not as hard, and are just flat.

They're about $50 for two, $95 for four.  They come with all parts needed,
and take about 30 seconds per door to install.

Highly recommended.  I have no affiliation with the product other than as
a satisfied customer.

Subject: 911 fuel line woes


I have this 72 911T with MFI that I have been fighting for two months now.
It runs great then cuts out with some nasty backfires.  My mechanic said
it was crap in the fuel system and for me to replace all the lines.  He
was gracious enough to pass on the job-- he did not want to touch it.

The car was sitting for nearly a decade before I picked it up.  I have now 
replaced all fuel (with the right type braided hoses) lines except the part 
of the hose coming out of the rear metal tube to the pump (just too many other things to remove!). The car now has a new pump and filter in the system as well. The cute little double-screen brass tank intake was cleaned too.

This leads me to suspect the tank is the culprit.  Is yanking the tank a
nasty job? What can I do to it once it is out?  Anyone been here before?
Books galore but enthusiasm is in short supply.  A new tank is not the 
preferred option here.

I have added one fuel additive to no avail (STP) and will try Techron
if you think it might help.  Comments? 

I really do want to drive this car.

Subject: Warm starting problem with '77 924


    I`ve had my `77 924 for the last four years and have had a problem
that will not go away.  (I've only been on this mailing list for the last
three months, and so I appologize if this has been discussed before.)

	- When the car is cold -- it starts up fine.
	- When the car is hot  -- it starts up fine.
	- When the car has been driven, and then let sit for
	  45 minutes to an hour, it sits and cranks for about 20 to 30
	  seconds before kicking in.

    The starter is going like a ball of fire -- but the engine just doesn't
catch.  It always starts, but it's real embarrassing sitting there while it
happens.

    I don't know much about car engines, but the mechanics I've taken it to
seem to have replaced almost everything except the air in the tires, but
to no avail.  Three different garages have worked on it -- but it persists.

    We started out by replacing the injectors, on the theory that
they were leaking and air was getting into the fuel lines.
We then replaced the fuel pump with a more recent version that had a valve
that keeps the fuel from going back in the wrong direction.  Both these
attempted fixes seemed very reasonable, and were suggested and performed
by a garage that works only on Porsches.

    I've met two other 924 owners with the same problem.  One of them had
the problem go away when he replaced the head gasket.  I've since replaced
my head gasket, but the problem didn't go away.  The other guy was
a guy I met at a gas station while we were both filling up with gas.  His
car had the exact same symptoms, and he didn't know what to try either.
I don't know whether he ever solved it, since I've never seen him again.

    Some of the other things I've had replaced are:
	- fuel accumulator
	- rotor
	- ignition wires
	- filters (all)
	- techron (I have no idea what this is)

     Has anyone else seen this problem?  More importantly, has anyone
solved it?  Since nothing else has worked I guess I COULD go try changing
the air in the tires?!

     By the way, I've also had the gas fumes problem that was recently
under discussion.  I long ago learned to live with that by just not
filling the tank all the way.

     Thanks.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  I will, however, be
out of the country for about a week and a half starting on July 29, and
will therefore not be able to answer mail during that time.

Hey fellow Porsche addicts!  Just discovered the group.  The Net is truly
great.  

Anyway, I have a question for the 912 experts out there.  I bought a 
'57 Speedster Replica about two years ago from a guy in San Francisco.
I don't know how many of you are familiar with replicas, in fact some of
you (Real Speedster owners) may despise them.  At least this one had a
912 engine.

My question (problem):  I want to know what is the proper oil temperature
for a 912 engine.  My engine has the 1720cc NPR big bore kit installed and
has 14,000 miles on rebuild.  It is from a '68 912 minus the air pump and
carb preheater stuff.  The operating temperature for my engine is 210degF,
but when I drive in 85 to 90 degF ambient temps the oil temp reaches as
high as 260 degF.  I believe this is TOO HOT which leads to my next 
question.  At what oil temp must I absolutely pull over and let the engine
cool down?  

I have a 4 to 1 extractor type exhaust installed, which supposedly helps
in reducing engine temps.  Also the engine compartment is well sealed.
There is a hole in the firewall directly in front of the fan intake
screen, which I have heard should also improve cooling.

Thanks,
Steve

Subject:  Dellorto Carbs

Does anyone have experience with Dellorto Carbs?  I have a pair of 36mm
Dellorto's installed on a 1720cc 912 engine and am experiencing starting
problems when the engine is cold.  Its like the engine is fuel starved
for the first two or three starts then finally it fires up.  During a
warm start I have to depress the throttle down to the floor or else
the engine absolutely won't start.  Are the Dellorto's the problem.
My battery is new as is the generator and voltage regulator so the 
problem has to be fuel related.  I've disconnected the stock fuel
pump and am now using an electric (Facet brand) pump which I understand
puts out the proper (3 lbs) fuel pressure for a 912.  So, I don't need
a fuel pressure regulator installed, right?  

Oh, regarding the stock fuel pump.  It doesn't work and I've tried a 
different stock pump.  It didn't work either.  Could there be a problem
with the part on the distributor shaft which contacts the end of the fuel
pump?  This is not so important, since I understand the Facet pump is
far superior to the stock fuel pump.  Just curious.

Thanks!

Subject: Of 924s and Men (women ,too)


Hi gang,

It's me again. I see some activity around 924s and 924 Turbos, here are
a few comments based on 15+ years of owning one.

Normally these things are bullet proof, the cars tend to go to hell 
mechanically when the oil isn't changed and driven in hot, stop and go 
traffic ( nothing else does well either). The cooling systems work well
unless your typical trip to work is less than ten miles. Then the system
never opens the thermostat and the coolant boils, making the water pump 
seal fail early and lots of rust in the block. This is a common 
occurance in the San Francisco area. 

Improper oil changes, wrong viscosity, traffic jams all cause the cam to
go away, the lubrication tube `cokes', stopping oil from getting to the
cam, then the lobes and followers wear. the metal will eventually 
destroy the bearings, then the crank. 

Turbos hate being idled for long periods as the oil flow from the pump 
is low and insufficient to cool the turbo. If you're stuck in traffic, 
turn on the airconditioning, it flows enough air to keep the turbo cool.

One thing a lot of 924 (and 944) owners do is leave off the gravel 
shield under the radiator, It is very important, this directs the 
airflow through the engine compartment and makes the radiator draft 
correctly. The little grill infront of the radiator directs air around 
the lower spoiler, restricting the amount into the radiator. Removal of it adds a significant amount of drag, but adds to the cooling of the 
car. This can be experimented with at the track, SCCA never noticed that
the two top slats were missing on Barney Gardiners 1981 SSA 924. It 
cured a small overheating problem.

Cracked exhaust manifolds. They crack. Cure: Replace with the late 1980 
and later stock manifold and down pipe. Those are good for 5 hp and at 
least 8 ft-lbs of torque. Also pass the California visual on earlier 
cars. Headers are a mixed bag. Most aren't worth the trouble as one has
to tune the CIS to work correctly. The best exhaust is a stock one with
the cat removed for `track testing'.

Ignition, the stock unit recurved to euro-spec (no vacuum retard) works
best, the curve is in the Haynes manual. Again, Those of us in 
California have the sceptre of the Smog-Nazis for the visual inspection.
On the mid 1980 and later with oxygen sensor, there is an idle 
stabiliztion box mounted with the ignition module on the left inner 
fender.  these have been known to go bad, be aware.

Cams, there's only one stock one that works, if you have an early (pre
1977 1/2) you will have the smog bastard. Put in the later cam and get 
10 hp, it's the same as the euro unit.

If you're interested, I have an article I wrote for Excellence on 
suspension for the 924.

For now,

If you want to find their value, call Robert Wood Inc. (310)473-6649
(I have no affiliation with this company other than the fact they've taken
my money...) and ask them how much
it would cost for the ones you have.   You can vary their value depending
upon condition (scratches, dings, etc.).  Stock Porsche wheels are NOT CHEAP.
I bought a set of 16" C2 wheels for race rubber on the RS America from Robert
Wood and they were expensive, but worth it.  In hindsignt, probably should
have bought some Revolutions (multi-piece lightweight) but I couldn't wait
for > 6 months for the gnomes to make 'em :-(.  


If you intend upon doing any sort of racing (autox or otherwise) it's VERY
advantageous to have an extra set of wheels.  If you want to drive it on
the street and autocross it, you can buy yourself a set of sticky tires, 

put them on the stock wheels and put your street tires on the aftermarket
wheels I assume are currently on the car.  


If you intend upon selling the car again some day, having the factory wheels
would probably add to its value.

What cought my eye was a twin distributor driven by a single shaft.
Six wires leaving each distributor but I could only see one wire going

it used for some other purpose?  Any fancy resoning behind this (dual

RE:  928 problems.

	Not aware of any mechanical failings common to 928's.  One reason is
lack of sufficient numbers built to establish trend data.  Another is it`s
always been Porsche's flagship (fact which escapes Americans, but not Germans)
and designed/built accordingly.  There are problems, however:

	1.  Complexity in maintenance; ie. removing rear deck carpet and
	spare tire, just to reach battery for a jump start.

	2.  Rare cars = rare parts = low numbers = high capital costs =
	high prices for new parts

	3.  Mind-Wobbling Depreciation:  presently exceeds $1000/month for late
	model 928S4/GT's

Recommendations: (strictly my opinions)

	Look for '86+ 928's (32-valves, ABS), less than 5000 miles/year,
	re-sellable color (red, white, black, maybe silver), 5-speed.
	'86: $15,000-    '87: ~$20,000    '90: ~$27,000

RE:  late-model 911's w/supertrapps.

	As far as headers/heat exchangers go, if you want heat,  SSI's are
	the hot set-up.  If you want to make use of the improved flow,
	you need a new DME chip (ie. Autothority), and a properly-flowed
	muffler (Alan Johnson, San Diego has a popular design).

	As for supertrapps, I use them with 1.75" MSDS headers on my race 
	car (no heat).  They needed custom flanges to mate to supertrapps.
	SSI's would have the same problem.  You would need to design/build
	a stainless steel interface.

	Supertrapps are the double-edged sword.  They are tunable by 
	choosing the number of pressure relief discs on the end.
        I run 8 discs to minimize backpressure and increase high-end power
        at the expense of low-end torque.
        But, I have yet to find someone who has done acceptable R&D on
	how many discs, what size motor, how many HP, how many dB, etc.
	This obviously requires a dyno.  If anyone out there has done
	this, please let us know.

You get more power from more air, more gas, and more RPM. You only get more 
power from igition mods if you have bad igition to begin with. The Jacobs

John, 
I just put SSI's on my carbuerated 2.7L.  The cars runs much better now.
no more popping or flat spots!  Sounds much better too, especially in 
the 2000-3000 range.  Performance is improved however I have no numbers
for you.  Anyways, if you decide to put the SSI's on, be sure the get
the correct styles.  The options are as follows:

	Thick flanges - Cars w/thermal reactors & possibly others
	Extended tubes - These will allow installation on 77 & later
			 911's w/915 transmission clutch assist spring
			 without bending the weld seam on the exchanger.
	Gaster Savers - '77 2.7's, '80-'83 3.0's, all 3.2's, & all Turbos
			These are the sleeves which fit up into the 
			exhaust port on the head.

You should probably call SSI (415-883-2000) and talk with them.  The 
people there are very knowledgeable.  Especially John.  They do not
drop ship so you will have to go through a distributor.  Send mail
if you have installation questions.

Please send me (via private mail) a contact at that wrecking yard. The
last time I had a 4-cam engine around, it was a $30K plus investment.
Of course, these people *OBVIOUSLY* know that, and also probably know
that finding the parts to *FIX* it is next to impossible. Still...

That is a dual ignition. Brain fade is keeping me from remembering
for sure, but I think it's a dual plug affair as well.  That twin 
distributor was responsible for much of the problems with the 
engine -- it's bad enough to synch dual two-throat carbs in '50s
technology, but to try and *mechanically* synch two distributors
as well was a bit much. Interesting article on this on either the 
June Excellence or a recent Pano.

Subject: Re: Problems with 928's (LJWILLIAMS)

There are a number of known areas to watch out for.

Watch out for high-mileage sticks that need synchros.  This'll run you
around $1500.  Try shifting into first above 30 mph.  It should go in
without trouble.  Or try 3rd around 70.  Any grinding or other
difficulty means trouble.

The early cars had a double plate clutch that has (IMHO) an
undeservedly bad reputation.  Sure, you can upgrade it to the single
disc clutch for a couple grand, but not worth it (again IMHO).  

Watch out for timing belt and water pumps.  They're about #500 labor
to change, and should definitely be done together (it's the same
work, so may as well change the other when one goes out.  It'll save
you money in the end).

The Central Warning System has a deservedly bad reputation.  They're
far too sensitive in non-critical areas, such as reading resistance
difference between the brake lights and constantly telling you one
light is out.  Many disgusted owners are rumored to have disconnected
the entire system.

Alternators seem to go often, can be rebuilt, but if not they're damn
expensive!

When driving it, if it doesn't drive/accelerate/handle perfectly AVOID
THAT CAR!  I drove a lot of 928's and they ALL drove perfectly.  Any
problem here probably means no maintenance or serious trouble.

The interiors can't handle the rigors of daily driving well, so expect
the seats, shift boot, etc. to look beat up.

Early cars with the leather dash tend to have the leather shrunk and
pulled away from the vents.  The later cars with plastic dashes tend
to crack in the sun.  (Both of these can be avoided with constant
care)

Compression should be like a new car.  They'll maintain high
compression into the multiple 100,000s.

Many of the electricals go out, like mirrors, seats, locks, etc.
Door switches are terrible.  Sometimes work, sometimes not.
Connectors are also more prone to corrosion more than most American or
Japanese cars.  This is often the trouble in the Central Warning
System (but good luck finding it!)

There are a number of really minor things that I look for:
Heater sliders falling off (VERY common)
Fader knob next to emergency brake gone (VERY common)
Hood or rear deck shocks won't hold the panel up (worst case), or
won't lift it with minimal help from you.  When front shocks are going
the hood tries to jam in the first few inches of opening.
These things can all be fixed cheaply and quickly, and if they're not
they tell me the owner hasn't maintained it too well.

Also look above the spare tire just inside the rear lights for the
tool kit.  All the tools should be there (obviously) but see if they
still have the spare spark plugs and spare bulbs.

Electric antennas go out often.

The alarm system tends to corrode and often go off when you unlock it.
The easy fix is to deny it has an alarm; just use the shorter key and
you'll never set the alarm.

That's about it off the top of my head!  Good luck!

Monty

PS--Aside from all the above problems, they're still my favorite car!
Sure better than those air-cooled things.  Call those a Porsche?  A
Porsche should be water-cooled!  8*)

Bill, 

Pull the tank and send it to a radiator shop to be "tanked", then
seal the inside with something like Wurth tank sealer. It's in the
archives, but naturally, I don't know where... Or, Jim Fuerstenburg
recommends something called GasTankReNu, a company that does this as

We talked about that earlier this month, or was it last month? Anyway, 
FTP last months' archives and if it's not there, it'll be in this
month's archives next month... 

In the meantime, the answer is: supercharging is a spectacularly good idea,
but you may have to re-engineer your engine to take advantage of it. Replacing
a turbocharger with a supercharger, however, may be nearly a bolt-on operation
and provide significant power increases, particularly at low RPM. Just
bolting on a kit to any engine may work, at least for a while, but not nearly 
so well as if it's correctly retrofit.

BTW, there's an article in the current "911 and Porsche World" magazine
(a UK magazine -- great stuff, BTW) about someone doing just that with
C2 coupes for racing purposes. As one of my business associates says,
"works like a hose"...

Classic hot-start problem, I would guess.  Two things to check.  First,
I believe the car came with two 20 ml. accumulators, and that one should
replace one of them with a 40 ml. accumulator.

The second is to install a check valve around the fuel pump.

Sorry to be so vague.  I lent out my up-to-'84 tech bulletins.  Perhaps
someone else can be more precise.

Could be engine oil, but I would first look for a leak of power
steering fluid from either the reservoir, the feed line to the pump,
or seeping from within the rack boot itself.

I've never actually seen the fluid from a motor mount.  It's always
either been inside the mount or gone.

The angle and location of the mount make it pretty much mandatory that
you measure its height with a tool.  There's a factory bulletin on
how to cobble one up out of wire or flat stock.  You cannot really
judge it very well by unaided eye.

>    - What is price & part number of the upgraded engine mount, are

I think the .04 part is the latest.  They are available in the after-
market, both wholesale and retail.  Be careful of old stock of older
versions from the retail aftermarket.  I know one source which is still
selling .00 timing belts for 944S' at a really swell price.

>    - Should I replace both mounts or only the defective one. (I

The defective one.  The other one, driver side, is much less prone to
failure because it isn't right up close to the exhaust.  Make sure your
heat shield is in place around the passenger-side mount, btw.

>    - How many hours of job are we talking here for a one or both
>      mount replacements?

We did my driver-side mount in less than an hour, last week.

    - Any comments on the do's and don't about this job?

    - Brief list of tasks to be performed to do the replacement. I
      ask this because I couldn't find it in my Haynes Manual and I
      don't have the shop manual yet?

You don't have to drop the subframe (honest, Stan, I swear).  You can
take the load off the mount by carefully jacking the engine using the
oil pan (block of wood between jack and pan).  Probably not a good idea
for 944S2 or 968 with their plastic oil pans.

If you think getting the collapsed mount out is a fiddle, wait till you
try getting the new one in.  Make life a little easier by trimming the
bottom stud of excess (uncaptured) length.

There are two different length bolts to be used depending on the height
of the foot of the engine mounting bracket.  Covered in tech bulletin
book G, group 1, number 9011, dated 13 Nov 90.

Subject: 914 starting, oil?, & VIN

Hey gang,

Any other 914 owners experience the problem of trying to start the car
after it has been sitting for a few days, and it starts, stalls, then
cranks and restarts?  Have noticed it also tends to take more cranking
after it has been run for a while, then parked for a short time (less than
an hour).  Have heard two differing opinions about this.  One version is
to pump the accelerator, other version says don't.  Open for suggestions.

Other question...should I be changing the oil every three months on this
car when I have only put 7k miles on it in 5 years?  I have heard lots of
theories about what engine oil, but I sure don't believe that the engine
knows that technology has changed.  Still inclined to stick with 30 weight
oil.  Temperature range here and mileage is not much different than Ohio.
(car was kept inside garage in Ohio, in case you are trying to figure that 
one out)

Final question... without original records, how can you tell your car's
original point of destination?  I have yet to see another 914 that looks
like mine.  I know it has been re-painted, but welds are smooth.  I've
looked in lots of 'picture books' but haven't found a match.  Anybody have
information on a car with a January '72 sticker?  Rear lights say '69,
vehicle number indicates it was a '72, title says '72.

Piece of cake.  After you get the lines off it and everything else out
of the way, it comes out with three allen bolts, if memory serves.

You'll find it easier to pull back the filler hose if you lube it with
a silicon spray.

This is the "heat soak" problem. I know how to fix it in 356 and 914s,
but don't have a clue on the 924. I can ask around.

	Is this an engine from a "'90's 911 Carrera 4" or from a "'50's
550 spyder"? Don't the new 911's have dual spark plugs now?  It sounds
like an engine from a new 911 to me.  Also i thought the V-type twin
distributor cured the timing problems caused by the original two separate
distributors driven from the ends of the cam shafts.

  This is probably true.....however for those who don't know trichlor

If your question pertains to a fuel additive (versus a spray or dip cleaner),
I recommend Chevron's Techron (no, not because I work for them)... Through my
own experience as well as friends (plus a little inside info). The fuel
additive really works. The compound is a Chevron developed product that is
sold to many other major oil Co.s as well as additive marketers for rebranding
into there own product lines. If you want to be sure of what you're buying,
get the Chevron branded stuff.

By the way, follow the directions exactly -- this is not a case of "more is
better". The effectiveness is actually REDUCED if too much or too little is
used. Also, if your deposit build-up is bad, you may need more than one
treatment. If this is the case, do not treat successive tanks. A reaction is
started with the first treatment that will continue for several tanks of
non-treated fuel. Best is to skip a few tanks in between treatments...

By the way, Porsche recommends Techron by name.........

You don't save much on the clutch job labor wise. My clutch is at 77k

He should have also replaced your motor mounts with the new style which

Depends on what you want to do with the car, if you like it, it still meets your
driving needs, and the repairs are less than what it would cost to replace it
with the same thing, then keep it. Otherwise, well....part it out? Sell body

Any one have handy the number for PCA membership sign up.

Also
I have a set of stock rims off my 87 930...two questions

2) Should I keep them for any reason??
    Only reason I would keep them is if I sell the car and want to

Leads me to ask the group if anyone thinks it's feasible to replace the main
and rod bearings in a _931_ without pulling the engine?  I'm looking at a
situation where the bearings (but not the crankshaft) are pretty heavily
scored, leading to some really low oil pressure readings.  The rest of the
block and the rings seem to be good (140psi compression, no oil consumption),
so I'd hate to pay someone $$$ to pull the whole thing just to pop in $100
worth of bearings.  Any thoughts?

Subject: 911 Salvage Title

Hello !
	I'm looking at picking up a project car to do a complete rebuild to,
and have pretty much decided on a 1978+ 911. The rebuild would include a
conversion to a convertible c2 turbo look. Since most of the car I will be
chopping up - I've pondered whether a salvaged title 911 would be all that
bad. I have a line on a 1979 targa - hit hard in the front that would be
cheap. I have access to full frame straightning equipment,mig etc so the work
does not bother me. The question I have is whether even if the car is
completely and professionly rebuilt, would a prospective Porsche buyer be
put-off by a salvage title. I would do a step-step photo shoot of the rebuild.

	I think 60 Minutes did a take on salvage titles that killed their
resale value. Comments/Opinions appreciated...

Seriously, I'm out in California, in the SF Bay Area.  The regs are rather

fuel stuff) have been "tampered with" (read: modified), then there is
_no_limit_ on what you must spend to make the car comply.  Basically, carbs are
illegal, without special dispensation or a Smog Check mechanic who doesn't pay

they may change their minds at any time.  (sigh!)

Subject: Self-service 928


A fellow wrote about purchasing a 928 and doing all the work himself,
a little something to be aware of:

The four-cam 928 motors must be removed from the car to remove the heads
and perform any upper-end work. The 2-cam 2 valve heads are removeable 
in the car. This operation is about a 10 hour job each direction for the
four cam car. They are very cheap when they require engine work.

For the people that wonder about which way the 924/944 etc engines come out, the drivetrains are installed from the BOTTOM of the vehicle on 
the assembly line, this is why certain locations can never be accessed 
in the car. The 924/944 engines will come out of the car from either 
the top or bottom of the car, remembering that there are a number of 
items which must be disconnected and/or removed in either case.

Have fun!

I'm not sure what state you're in.  In MA my 70 914 has been exempt from
smog testing for a few years now.  I could get it to pass though, although
in MA the fact that I've changed to carbs is not a problem.

Regarding FI vs carbs, my problem with the FI is simply that mine was so
old.  I think that if everything works perfectly the FI may run better
than the Webers, although I'm not quite sure of the top end power.  Would
definitely run better in various anbient conditions.  With all those 20+
yr old gizmos and hoses, I doubt whether my FI could measure up to the
carbs without a serious amount of attention (read time & money).  For the
few hundred bucks and days worth of work to put the carbs on, the car has
been a completely reliable performer for the past 8 years.  Besides, I
love the way they look, the way they sound, and the feel of the throttle
response.  Very different from FI.  More like the way I envision a 356 to
drive.  just my opinions, though.  Either way, a fun car.

I recently purchased my first 'real' car:  an '87 944 Turbo.

I have a few simple questions:

What do you use to maintain the exterior/interior of
your car?  (ie. soaps, waxes, leather treatments ect.)
If this has been discussed at great lengths before, just point
me at the correct archives.

Re cleaning materials: For the Rubber work (spoiler, bumpers, window trim, 
mirror trim etc) I have found Maguire's Mirrorglaze 40 to be excellent. I 
have an 84 944 that has spent all it's life in the Arizona sun and the 
spoiler etc still look brand new.  This stuff doesn't coat like some of the 
popular pruducts, it just conditions and restores.  Works great on vinyl

Subject: 924 Turbo Bearings

RE: Paul's message of 19 July.

Paul, pull the motor. It's a time-consuming, but not too difficult a
process.

You will have to disconnect the bell housing to remove the clutch and 
flywheel anyway, it's easier to pull the motor with the crank and 
everything in it. The issue here is that your crank is scored and needs 
machining. You will find that the top land on your piston is probably
distored from the heat and there are scores in the cylinder walls. The 
oil pump also has to come off. 

A more pleasant note, if you remove the engine and do your disassembly-
assembly outside the engine, the turbo stuff goes on more easily. Trust
me on that one. 

There's more bad news, you'll want to find out where the particles 
came from, just pull it down and check your cam and followers and 
examine them for wear. You'll also notice wear in your valve guides.

you'll lose the bearings in short order if you just do just that. No one
said these things were cheap and simple.  Do it right and you'll be
rewarded with a nice running car.

If any one else is reading, a 1979-80 924 turbo can be enhanced if 
you're about to rebuild by using the 81-82 8.1:1 compression pistons.
They cost the same, you get more in town driveability because of the 
half point of compression.

Subject: 914-6 evaluation?

Hi all,
Last friday I got a chance to look at an original 914-6. Original
owner, paint, interior, engine, etc. 67K miles. I drove it a bit,
but the engine pinged at anything over half throttle from 2-5K RPM
(loudly), so I didn't get a chance to evaluate performance. The
tranny was very vague shifting (compared to my 75, anyway), but the
synchros appeared OK. Now the questions... Given that my interests
are performance rather than originality, what does an original have
to offer that a conversion won't have? (apart from a heater). Asking
on this car was $15K, and I have seen a number of conversions in the
$7K range. Benefits including sideshifter, newer interior and choice
of motor in an already debugged package (vs doing the conversion
myself). Is $15K for this car reasonable? I see it asked a lot, but
what are these cars actually selling for?
Thanks for your thoughts on this.

OK so now I know the front 8x16" are worth $150 each
But for the 9x16" "pretty valuble" is a little vague.. $300 each?? 5, 6,

                 205x50x15's
Comments:

These tires are incredible!  I'm a YOKOHAMA Fan, but these tires are Very
fast. Comments have been made about the way the feel mushy upon initial
turn in (you turn the car in- then the tires react comments...)  Well, I
think the secret to these tires is running the right sized rim for the tire
mounted.  In the past, I would have mounted these 205x50x15's on a 6" rim.
This would have given, as "The Real" Roger Johnson commented: "... the car
would turn in then the tires would catch up!"

Having mounted them on 7" rims, this really stretches out the tire and makes
the side wall very square... This greatly improves the sidewall stiffeness
and make turn in response, IMHO, quicker than the RSII's!!!

And, on top of this, the learning curve for these tires is very steep(quick)!
In no time, I had an in-experienced, never have AX'd, beginner driving the
car at its limit, **SAFELY**, with incredible car control!  I got in it
and drove immediately, what I feel, quicker than my RSII's.  I then took
the car out for some HIGH SPEED (read:tight Mountain switch-back's) and found
them to be very forgiven at the limit and definitely easy to 'read' at this
limit!!! I did get the front to break away slightly, but it was easliy
brought back into shape by simply modulating front tire loading (squeezing
the brakes slightly to transfer load to the front of the car).

All in all, these tire are, simply put, incredible (and,after 130 miles
of low speed/tire scrubbing and high speed drifting: the tires are not
even broken in yet!! See my comment on Ken Mitchel's wear data at the
Wendover NT event using 224's!!).

It could be an interesting '94 if BFG's AX compound tire is as good as
their current RR (224) tire, just much stickier (and I hope they solve
their wear compared to the RSII's!!!!!).

I'll use these at Driver's schools at Portland/Sears/Laguna Seca/Seatle,
as well as a few AX's until I get the October '93 release of the AX
compound tire.  Then I'll do a comparison with my RSII's (still VERY,VERY
fast with GREAT WEAR(!!!!)), so I'll keep you all informed (if you care!)

G'day:

Subject: Another 944 engine mount woes

While changing the front brakes pads last Sunday, I noticed  oil
on the right-side steering linkage rubber boots. I have not yet
verified whether it the engine mount or something else that is
leaking, but considering the 944 engine mount problem, I suspect
that to be the case.

So before I go and replace these mounts, I wanted to get some
wisdom from porschephiles.

    - What is a quick way to verify a bad engine mount beside the 
      obvious oil leak?

    - What is price & part number of the upgraded engine mount, are
      these only available through dealer or can they be purchased
      elsewhere?

    - Should I replace both mounts or only the defective one. (I
      recently got this car and don't have the maintenance record)?

    - How many hours of job are we talking here for a one or both
      mount replacements?

    - Any comments on the do's and don't about this job?

    - Brief list of tasks to be performed to do the replacement. I
      ask this because I couldn't find it in my Haynes Manual and I
      don't have the shop manual yet?

I  know this is a long list of questions but I also, know that most
of them would get answered. To save the net bandwidth you can mail 
the response directly to me.

Answer is: (come on everybody...) "it depends". First things first -- if you
don't have a Hunter or Bosch frame machine, and the factory measurments for
re-aligning the tub, forget it. I've been through this on my personal car. You
can't pull it out "close enough" like you can on a Chevy truck or something.
It pretty much has to be on the money, or you lose *BIG TIME* when it comes 
time to set up the suspension. This *IS* a very high performance sports car,
right?

Second, dealing with a car on salvage title. There is, in most states, a 
mechanism for moving a car from a salvage title to a "real" title. You should 
check with your DMV about that proceedure. Doing this typically involves a set 
of state inspections, to make sure that they're not giving you a title for your 
refrigerator or something. Once you have a real title, who cares? *EXCEPT*
that one of the first questions I ever get asked when selling a car (after "how
many miles does it have") is "has it ever been wrecked?" How you answer that
is a matter for you and your consience. I have always told the complete truth
on my cars.

Third, value. Here's the *REAL* "it depends" part. Ghost Racing raced an MR-2
that we bought on a salvage title, rebuilt, re-titled, and after its retirement
as a competition car, sold it to our crew chief who has put another 30k miles
on it. No loss of value, because it was going to a knowledgible consumer. We
also have a 911 that was the 1990 SCCA Solo II champ in F Prepared. It's 
built out of two different tubs, welded together. On a salvage title. There's
probably $15K + just in the engine, another $4k or so in the suspension
and wheels. It is *NOT* street legal, nor could it be made street legal. But
what's it worth to a competitor? For that matter, is it worth anything to a
non-competitor??

Where you lose on value is when you try to sell the car as a "perfect" or
"near perfect" car to an ill-informed consumer. If I knew a car had been
in a heavy collision, it would not deter me from buying it -- but it *WOULD*
change the way I investigated the car. I'd want to have the tub checked, to
inspect *ALL* the mount points for suspension and drivetrain, to check the
fit and finish a bit closer, etc. And if possible, to talk to the guys who did
the work if I didn't know them. Then I'd pay a fair price for it. However,
if it didn't pass my inspection, I wouldn't buy it. And a bargain basement
price wouldn't make any difference at all.

Finally, conversions and updates. When you change the car from stock 
configuration you have truely stepped into The Twilight Zone. There is 
*NO* rule for value, *NO* benchmark, *NO* standards. What you can get
for a "conversion car" is strictly a matter between you and the buyer.
I've seen people lose their ass *BIG TIME* on such deals. For example
we joke that the VP of the local Porsche Club has the "Worlds Most Expensive
$8,000 Car". It's a '69 911E that has been, ahhhh, modified. To look like
an early 70s S, with a fake Marlborough Racing look, a tail that could have
never come with the car, a bizarre custom interior (including alligator 
inlays on the dash!), an "updated and modified" engine, polished and chromed
wheels, etc. I really don't know how much he has in it, but I do know
what it's really worth -- about $8k, unless he finds someone who wants

The exceptions to this rule are conversions to factory spec for that

parts in a manner that is indistinguishable from a factory installation. Then
it would be treated like a factory cab, value-wise. Of course, there are
*STUPID* things you can do that way too -- I know of a pre-A 356 that was
in very good all original condition which was hacked to add a factory sunroof
top clip, and new paint and interior. Value dropped precipitously due to
destruction of an original car in original condition.

 If you have heavily scored big-end bearings then you should ask yourself
 where that material (that once was part of the bearings) has gone?

 It generally trashes your oil pump and ends up in the pan's filter
 screen (after having trashed the cam tower bearing surface as well).

 I'm afraid that your only sensible option is a complete strip-down,
 check and re-assembly. Otherwise I think you're driving a timebomb.

1-800-ADP-LOCK.  They're called Armor Door Plates, and they're well worth
the money.  Any water-cooled VW owner can tell you...

These are much better than the other versions.  These are not just flat
plates; they have flanges that go into the door so they can't be bent and
the screwdriver cannot reach the release lever, and they're made of
hardened steel.  Others are not as hard, and are just flat.

They're about $50 for two, $95 for four.  They come with all parts needed,
and take about 30 seconds per door to install.

Highly recommended.  I have no affiliation with the product other than as
a satisfied customer.

Subject: 911 fuel line woes


I have this 72 911T with MFI that I have been fighting for two months now.
It runs great then cuts out with some nasty backfires.  My mechanic said
it was crap in the fuel system and for me to replace all the lines.  He
was gracious enough to pass on the job-- he did not want to touch it.

The car was sitting for nearly a decade before I picked it up.  I have now 
replaced all fuel (with the right type braided hoses) lines except the part 
of the hose coming out of the rear metal tube to the pump (just too many other things to remove!). The car now has a new pump and filter in the system as well. The cute little double-screen brass tank intake was cleaned too.

This leads me to suspect the tank is the culprit.  Is yanking the tank a
nasty job? What can I do to it once it is out?  Anyone been here before?
Books galore but enthusiasm is in short supply.  A new tank is not the 
preferred option here.

I have added one fuel additive to no avail (STP) and will try Techron
if you think it might help.  Comments? 

I really do want to drive this car.

Subject: Warm starting problem with '77 924


    I`ve had my `77 924 for the last four years and have had a problem
that will not go away.  (I've only been on this mailing list for the last
three months, and so I appologize if this has been discussed before.)

	- When the car is cold -- it starts up fine.
	- When the car is hot  -- it starts up fine.
	- When the car has been driven, and then let sit for
	  45 minutes to an hour, it sits and cranks for about 20 to 30
	  seconds before kicking in.

    The starter is going like a ball of fire -- but the engine just doesn't
catch.  It always starts, but it's real embarrassing sitting there while it
happens.

    I don't know much about car engines, but the mechanics I've taken it to
seem to have replaced almost everything except the air in the tires, but
to no avail.  Three different garages have worked on it -- but it persists.

    We started out by replacing the injectors, on the theory that
they were leaking and air was getting into the fuel lines.
We then replaced the fuel pump with a more recent version that had a valve
that keeps the fuel from going back in the wrong direction.  Both these
attempted fixes seemed very reasonable, and were suggested and performed
by a garage that works only on Porsches.

    I've met two other 924 owners with the same problem.  One of them had
the problem go away when he replaced the head gasket.  I've since replaced
my head gasket, but the problem didn't go away.  The other guy was
a guy I met at a gas station while we were both filling up with gas.  His
car had the exact same symptoms, and he didn't know what to try either.
I don't know whether he ever solved it, since I've never seen him again.

    Some of the other things I've had replaced are:
	- fuel accumulator
	- rotor
	- ignition wires
	- filters (all)
	- techron (I have no idea what this is)

     Has anyone else seen this problem?  More importantly, has anyone
solved it?  Since nothing else has worked I guess I COULD go try changing
the air in the tires?!

     By the way, I've also had the gas fumes problem that was recently
under discussion.  I long ago learned to live with that by just not
filling the tank all the way.

     Thanks.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  I will, however, be
out of the country for about a week and a half starting on July 29, and
will therefore not be able to answer mail during that time.

Hey fellow Porsche addicts!  Just discovered the group.  The Net is truly
great.  

Anyway, I have a question for the 912 experts out there.  I bought a 
'57 Speedster Replica about two years ago from a guy in San Francisco.
I don't know how many of you are familiar with replicas, in fact some of
you (Real Speedster owners) may despise them.  At least this one had a
912 engine.

My question (problem):  I want to know what is the proper oil temperature
for a 912 engine.  My engine has the 1720cc NPR big bore kit installed and
has 14,000 miles on rebuild.  It is from a '68 912 minus the air pump and
carb preheater stuff.  The operating temperature for my engine is 210degF,
but when I drive in 85 to 90 degF ambient temps the oil temp reaches as
high as 260 degF.  I believe this is TOO HOT which leads to my next 
question.  At what oil temp must I absolutely pull over and let the engine
cool down?  

I have a 4 to 1 extractor type exhaust installed, which supposedly helps
in reducing engine temps.  Also the engine compartment is well sealed.
There is a hole in the firewall directly in front of the fan intake
screen, which I have heard should also improve cooling.

Thanks,

Does anyone have experience with Dellorto Carbs?  I have a pair of 36mm
Dellorto's installed on a 1720cc 912 engine and am experiencing starting
problems when the engine is cold.  Its like the engine is fuel starved
for the first two or three starts then finally it fires up.  During a
warm start I have to depress the throttle down to the floor or else
the engine absolutely won't start.  Are the Dellorto's the problem.
My battery is new as is the generator and voltage regulator so the 
problem has to be fuel related.  I've disconnected the stock fuel
pump and am now using an electric (Facet brand) pump which I understand
puts out the proper (3 lbs) fuel pressure for a 912.  So, I don't need
a fuel pressure regulator installed, right?  

Oh, regarding the stock fuel pump.  It doesn't work and I've tried a 
different stock pump.  It didn't work either.  Could there be a problem
with the part on the distributor shaft which contacts the end of the fuel
pump?  This is not so important, since I understand the Facet pump is
far superior to the stock fuel pump.  Just curious.

Subject: Of 924s and Men (women ,too)


Hi gang,

It's me again. I see some activity around 924s and 924 Turbos, here are
a few comments based on 15+ years of owning one.

Normally these things are bullet proof, the cars tend to go to hell 
mechanically when the oil isn't changed and driven in hot, stop and go 
traffic ( nothing else does well either). The cooling systems work well
unless your typical trip to work is less than ten miles. Then the system
never opens the thermostat and the coolant boils, making the water pump 
seal fail early and lots of rust in the block. This is a common 
occurance in the San Francisco area. 

Improper oil changes, wrong viscosity, traffic jams all cause the cam to
go away, the lubrication tube `cokes', stopping oil from getting to the
cam, then the lobes and followers wear. the metal will eventually 
destroy the bearings, then the crank. 

Turbos hate being idled for long periods as the oil flow from the pump 
is low and insufficient to cool the turbo. If you're stuck in traffic, 
turn on the airconditioning, it flows enough air to keep the turbo cool.

One thing a lot of 924 (and 944) owners do is leave off the gravel 
shield under the radiator, It is very important, this directs the 
airflow through the engine compartment and makes the radiator draft 
correctly. The little grill infront of the radiator directs air around 
the lower spoiler, restricting the amount into the radiator. Removal of it adds a significant amount of drag, but adds to the cooling of the 
car. This can be experimented with at the track, SCCA never noticed that
the two top slats were missing on Barney Gardiners 1981 SSA 924. It 
cured a small overheating problem.

Cracked exhaust manifolds. They crack. Cure: Replace with the late 1980 
and later stock manifold and down pipe. Those are good for 5 hp and at 
least 8 ft-lbs of torque. Also pass the California visual on earlier 
cars. Headers are a mixed bag. Most aren't worth the trouble as one has
to tune the CIS to work correctly. The best exhaust is a stock one with
the cat removed for `track testing'.

Ignition, the stock unit recurved to euro-spec (no vacuum retard) works
best, the curve is in the Haynes manual. Again, Those of us in 
California have the sceptre of the Smog-Nazis for the visual inspection.
On the mid 1980 and later with oxygen sensor, there is an idle 
stabiliztion box mounted with the ignition module on the left inner 
fender.  these have been known to go bad, be aware.

Cams, there's only one stock one that works, if you have an early (pre
1977 1/2) you will have the smog bastard. Put in the later cam and get 
10 hp, it's the same as the euro unit.

If you're interested, I have an article I wrote for Excellence on 
suspension for the 924.

For now,

If you want to find their value, call Robert Wood Inc. (310)473-6649
(I have no affiliation with this company other than the fact they've taken
my money...) and ask them how much
it would cost for the ones you have.   You can vary their value depending
upon condition (scratches, dings, etc.).  Stock Porsche wheels are NOT CHEAP.
I bought a set of 16" C2 wheels for race rubber on the RS America from Robert
Wood and they were expensive, but worth it.  In hindsignt, probably should
have bought some Revolutions (multi-piece lightweight) but I couldn't wait
for > 6 months for the gnomes to make 'em :-(.  


If you intend upon doing any sort of racing (autox or otherwise) it's VERY
advantageous to have an extra set of wheels.  If you want to drive it on
the street and autocross it, you can buy yourself a set of sticky tires, 

put them on the stock wheels and put your street tires on the aftermarket
wheels I assume are currently on the car.  


If you intend upon selling the car again some day, having the factory wheels
would probably add to its value.

I suspect this has to be an engine from the current 911 Carrera 2/4,
this has dual distributors, driving two spark plugs per cylinder.

If it really is the 4 cam, dual distributor unit which went into
a very few 356 cars and some other racing beasts, it would be worth huge
money, as are the cars that it went into.

I was reading about this engine last night, and can confirm that the early
versions did have dual distributors driven from the camshafts later
revised to a drive from the crankshaft to cure timing problems.

Please bear with me you 924 experts...
I had a '77 Scirocco that had the exact same symptoms.  It had the Bosch
K-Jetronic fuel injection (not sure if the 924 had this).

The problem was bad ball checks in the injector heads.  Replacement was easy,
part cost was $18 ea (circa '79).  Mine had two bad ones.

Shade tree mechanic diagnosis method was to run the car for a minute or two,
shut down and check each injector (they popped out of the rubber grommet on
mine quite easily).  Replace the ones with a wet or dripping tip.

Hope this helps....

Classic hot-start problem, I would guess.  Two things to check.  First,
I believe the car came with two 20 ml. accumulators, and that one should
replace one of them with a 40 ml. accumulator.

The second is to install a check valve around the fuel pump.

Sorry to be so vague.  I lent out my up-to-'84 tech bulletins.  Perhaps
someone else can be more precise.

   The angle and location of the mount make it pretty much mandatory that
   you measure its height with a tool.  There's a factory bulletin on
   how to cobble one up out of wire or flat stock.  You cannot really
   judge it very well by unaided eye.

One thing I've done to spot a mount that has split is to jack up the
engine with a floor jack very carefully and inspect the deflection of
the mount, if it is really split through you'll see it very plainly.

I have put SSI's on our '84 Carerra.  It requires new oil lines and some heater
line mods (if you need a lot of heat - we get plenty without the mods).

I disconnect the oxy sensor for AX use (quicker throttle response as Motronic
fails rich (I believe)).  I reconnect for normal use (starting is rough OTW).

In a previous Excellence, Bruce Anderson was dyno testing performance chips and
found the SSI's with a free flow exhaust gave the biggest performance boost
for a single upgrade (I have the issue, but don't recall the date -- late '91
I believe).

I put on a Bursch free flow muffler -- works fine & not too loud...

BTW, I am selling the whole set up as we plan to sell the car (another note).

John,
I just put SSI's on my carbuerated 2.7L.  The cars runs much better now.
no more popping or flat spots!  Sounds much better too, especially in
the 2000-3000 range.  Performance is improved however I have no numbers
for you.  Anyways, if you decide to put the SSI's on, be sure the get
the correct styles.  The options are as follows:

        Thick flanges - Cars w/thermal reactors & possibly others
        Extended tubes - These will allow installation on 77 & later
                         911's w/915 transmission clutch assist spring
                         without bending the weld seam on the exchanger.
        Gaster Savers - '77 2.7's, '80-'83 3.0's, all 3.2's, & all Turbos
                        These are the sleeves which fit up into the
                        exhaust port on the head.

You should probably call SSI (415-883-2000) and talk with them.  The
people there are very knowledgeable.  Especially John.  They do not
drop ship so you will have to go through a distributor.  Send mail
if you have installation questions.

Assuming you are having a fuel system problem, you are going to have
to measure the system fuel pressures with an accurate guage (or have
your mechanic do it) and compare it under the several operating

valve *seems* to be the problem, and is common on CIS cars, where the
"rest" pressure drops off and the car is tough to start after the
pressure "bleeds down" when hot. But since this didn't help you're
going to have to take a methodical troubleshooting approach. Ask your
mechanic what the fuel pressures are (both system and control) for
each condition, cold, hot and warmup. Hopefully he has recorded these numbers.

Subject: 914-6 evaluation?


   Last friday I got a chance to look at an original 914-6. Original
   owner, paint, interior, engine, etc. 67K miles. I drove it a bit,
   but the engine pinged at anything over half throttle from 2-5K RPM
   (loudly), so I didn't get a chance to evaluate performance. The

Well, for one you get the ignition key on the left hand side of the
steering column on the original. You get the *single* front rubberized
engine mount. But the thing you are really paying for is that VIN
number starting with 914XXXXX instead of 471XXXX. Other then that
you're better off in terms of most value for the dolar to pick up an
already "debugged (I like that term) conversion with the best motor
you can find, IMO if you're not concerned about investment potential.

You can have a heater in a conversion if you use original heat exchangers btw.

Any of you racers out there have a set of 911/2 '66-'68 fenders
you want to sell - must be super clean!  (If anyone needs
two "not-so-clean" fenders, let me know, I'll sell 'em REAL cheap)

I finally have all the sheet metal welded in and its ready for
reassembly (after 1+ year of welding/grinding).

Thanks,
Ron De Lange

P.S.  If you are a racer and havent replaced 'em yet, Tweeks had
a bunch of fiberglass fenders dirt cheap ($100 ea?).
Looks like they would be some work to install - hole drilling/fitting.

I ran Dunlops and they ran great in the rain...at first. Unless they have 
improved the design there is a flaw. Inbetween EVERY rib on the edge of the tire 
there is a sidewall-stiffener (looks like a tread wear mark, but is the wrong 
height.) When the tire wears down to this level it loses most all wet-weather 
traction. This is not true of other tires I have tried that only put the 
sidewall stiffeners every 2-3 ribs.

This is commonly called the Gatorback, nicknamed the Skatorback due to its low 
level of handling water.

 - Ouch.  Sorry to hear about that.  However, in the most recent Pano
(or was it the previous one?), Horace Searcie from LPR had a letter
which discussed an anti-carjack device he had installed on his 911T.
Basically, he added a switch to kill the fuel pump.  The car supposedly
will still drive for a bit, but then it mysteriously dies....  Best to be
out of sight when that happens, of course!

Could be seomething simple, like they left the vaccuum hoses connected
when they timed it, or they're using 87 octane....  Or it could be 
something expensive wrong, or it could be covering up the fact that
something expensive is wrong....

I thought that some of the conversions still had heaters?  It may be a
question of shelling out the $$ for 914/6 heat exhangers...
Anyway, the 914/6 was only sold from 70-71 (maybe a few in 72?).
As such, it had the tail-shifter, which may account for the vague shifting
you noticed, and the "spartan" interior, with the immobile passenger
seat.  The HP benefits are limited over a 2.0 4-cyl, unless you go in for
modifications (as many do).  US-spec 4-cyl HP was about 95, and the six
had about 110.  2.4's and 2.7's can have a *lot* more, but if you are
going that route, why not just put that engine in a /4 chassis?  The main
benefits seem to be the fact that the installation has been debugged,
the brakes are a bit better (??I think), and that the wheels are 5-bolt
already.  If you are looking for the best performance, try to find a 
conversion that's been done *right*, which can be hard to do.

>Is $15K for this car reasonable? I see it asked a lot, but

I recently saw several original sixes at a couple of swap meets
selling for $10-12K.  They seemed to be in pretty good shape,
but they didn't seem to be getting many offers.

Subject: 924 Starting problems


To the fellow with the starting problem, The auxillary air bypass 
operates when the engine is warm, also. If it has been removed and
replaced without coating the surface that mates to the manifold, it 
will operate incorrectly when the engine is warm.

One other tip to you CIS freaks, the sensor plate needs to be free of 
grease, oil, gasoline grunge and dirt. The boot should be removed and 
the plate inspected at major services. The height also needs to be 
checked as it will cause warm start problems. The O-rings around the 
fuel injectors get hard and leak air, another source of rough idle or 
hard starting, those can be chedcked with the engine idling and 
squirting the area around the nozzle with water. If the engine idles 
rough, replace the seal. The plastic (phenolic) seats are threaded in 
and sometimes vibrate loose, check those.

The water method can be used with the timed injection cars to check for 
injector air leaks, be careful about the wiring harness.


944 engine mounts, the best ones are the non-hydralics that have 
appeared on the late 944 Turbos and S2s. Forget the others and I'll 
have to recommend, replace both at the same time. The driver's side 
can partially fail and take the passenger's side out without totally
going. 
Remove the crossmember if you're doing the mount change in your garage, 
a hoist to allow you to stand while doing the job allows a better 
working angle so the crossmember isn't a problem at that height. The 
only pain is the power steering breather line which some damn engineer
put on the top side of the crossmember. It's a 2 1/2 hour job to change
the mounts. I find it easir to wedge the mounts in the crossmember out 
of the car when the car in low, as it would be in my garage, then lower 
the engine so the member and mounts can be bolted back to the engine.
Then riase everything and reassemble.(I've left out a few steps).

944 oil cap and dipstick. If you have a slightly rough idle and the 
motor mounts have been changed, check your dipstick. The crankcase needs
to be closed (like a 914). the rubber seal gets hard and leaks air. 
Ditto for the rubber seal in the oil filler cap.

Stan,
	Thank-you for your reply. I have to agree with your comments regarding
the after value of any project car - it depends on how bad you want to sell it
and how bad someone wants to buy it. plain and simple.

	Is there any reason why you referenced those 2 frame machines in
particular ?. My friend has a Blackhawk - I'd use the Mitchell guide for
measurements and clamp/jig wise I might have to get a little creative but
assume that it wouldn't be that bad.

	Does anyone have any frame horror stories or advice as to pulling...

	Also, would this conference support a buy/sell section for people
	who want to sell Porsche parts or post a note looking to buy ?

Tom

Are you sure this is a fuel problem?  I'm not sure about the

same problem (exact same problem) and it turned out to be the shielded

Subject: Cracked Exhaust Manifold


Mike,

Sad to say, if you have had it welded before and it's cracking again,
the manifold has gone past the point-of-no return and has begun to
crystalize along grain seams from the casting process. If you replace it
with a nex one, there is an upgrade (read expensive) that updates the 
1980 to the 1981 with the stainless steel bolts. It works and is
much more reliable than the 1980 manifold. Look for a donor 1981 931
first, buy a new one as last resort. The bolts, spacers, gaskets and
misc hardware will run an additional $250 unless someone helps on the 
deal. 
While you're at it, check the high-pressure oil-feed line to the turbo
and make sure it's clear of coked oil. Replace the oil feed O-rings on 
the top and bottom of the turbo, when the mainfold comes off it's 
another couple of hours to get rid of a pair of potential leaks. (Most
turbo leaks are those two pesky seals, they get cooked early on, then 
leak).

Let me locate the suspension article file first, then I'll get back on 
line and ask for your FAX #.

Also, a question about your post: I have an '80 931 and it has a
cracked exhaust manifold that I'm dealing with right now.  It's been
welded and failed again in the same place (the weld failed).  Is it
worth trying to repair this thing again, or do I bite the bullet for
$800 worth of new manifold from Porsche?

Thanks for the suggestions...

Subject: HELP: buying 1986 911 Carrera


I am about to buy my first PORSCHE!

Please HELP me understand the level of commitment that this
purchase will entail....

The CAR: 1986 911 Carrera  ** 83,000 miles **. Equipped with AC, PW. PL.
door panel original alarm, has a whale-tail, rear tires 225x16
front 205x15 (7J and 8J I think). The car has the "aggressive"
turbo-look: black with black leather interior (all *cosmetics* in
first class shape). I am not all that thrilled with the "stealth"
look (perhaps I will undo the TAIL).

Technical concerns: The owner (one only) was a PCA member took good
care of the car (dealer maintained with records)! He did not have
any engine or *clutch* work done. This is one area of insecurity
for  me: the COSTS to come...for these items  I owned and worked on
English 2-seaters (MG, TR-4, and YES; Austin Healey, etc.).  

The purchase circumstances were such that I was unable to do more
than test drive at moderate speed and look at it on a lift. It
drove very well a bit hard into 2nd gear (perhaps synchros will
need work). The car was traded in for a Corvette (Chevy Dealer!);
the interest level was very high (competing multiple Porsche philes
buyers in the same room). My decision was colored with desire. 

Please share with me your appraisal of the reliability and
maintenance requirements of this car. I am most eager to hear from
you!

How much more specific do you want us to be? Fully 26 of 39 (66%)
subject lines contain a model number. Of the rest, only one or two would
merit one by your system (the rest not being model specific).

If you really need some sort of way to filter out uninteresting mail, I
recommend that you look into one of the general purpose mail filters
(procmail, etc.) which can scan the headers (or even the body of the
messages) for keywords and reroute accordingly.

Don't ask me for details on procmail: I didn't write it, I don't know
who did and I don't currently use it (though I used to use an older
version of it).  Use archie or peruse your favorite archive to find it.

Subject:      924's and demonic possession

regarding the trouble starting the 924 under partly cooled down conditions.
My 931 has this problem as well. I still think there is a leak somewhere.
I have made it much easier to start by setting the mixture somewhat richer
than it should be. This helps. A lot. Look for air leaks. If the air enters
without passing the sensor plate, then you will get insufficient fuel. When
cold, the cold start valve offset this condition, and you can start it.
When it's hot. It starts easier anyway, but in that gray area of partly
cooled down, the mixture is too lean for easy starting. As an experiment,
when you are experiencing one of those tough starting fits, try sticking
a pencil into the air flow sensor plate <gently> to hold it down a bit.
Then try starting. Gary Cook recommended this procedure to me, and it
does indeed work. Look for leaking fuel lines in that hell hole area
under the distributor around the warm up regulator.
My only other guess for likely candidates is the cold start valve itself.
Comments welcome here from any CIS experts: If the cold start valve is
leaking, you won't have full pressure to start the engine when it is partly
cooled down. It may take a lot of cranking to get the thing going again, since
you won't have the benefit of the additional fuel from the cold start nozzle
until the engine cools down further.
Happy hunting.

The dealer history and PCA membership are a good sign. It is essential
that you have the vehicle inspected by an expert if you are not buying
through an official Porsche dealer. Some people would argue that you should
have an expert inspect it even if it is from an official Porsche
dealer, they might be able to tell you if you are getting value for money.

I really think that you are in danger of making an impulse purchase here.
Porsche have made over 300000 vehicles, 85% are still running. There are
plenty out there to choose from. My advice:

 1 Decide on the exact vehicle spec you want
 2 Follow up every example you can find of your spec
 3 Engage expert help if you are a first time buyer especially
 4 Find the one that offers best value for money, go in bidding
   low, don't exceed your target price.

Your 911 will *probably* be reliable and economical. If you don't take
a lot of care in purchase this may prove not to be the case, the more 
thought out your purchase strategy, the better the result IMHO.

Gotta agree w/Jim Pasha et al on this one -- filtering porschephiles is much

Setup a single, campus-wide porschephiles "user" to receive the feed (in digest

Subject: BFG 224s

I tried a set of the new BFG road race design tires this last weekend.  I'm
impressed.  We had a Saturday practice/Sunday championship event at Pt. Magu
which is mostly coarse asphalt.

On the long, fast Saturday course, I took 7 runs on the 224s followed by 4 runs
on the 206s (autocross compound).  Both sets were in the 205/55-14 size mounted
5.5 inch rim on my CS Miata.

Here's a summary of my impressions by surface:

 - coarse asphalt: 224s feel more linear than the 206s. Better turn-in and
  smaller slip angles.

 - concrete: more difficult to modulate braking with the 224s.

 - sealed asphalt: 224s run at larger slip angles than 206s.

When I put on the 206s, I thought they were much faster.  The 206s give
excellent feedback (better than the Yoko RSIIs, which tend to feel nervous
at the limit).  However, I was never able to equal my best time on the 224s.
The 224s had the greatest advantage on the coarse asphalt.

I thinks it's too early to assess longevity.  Unlike Paul Brown, I did manage
to get significant wear on the 224s in my first outing (but Pt. Magu is tough
on tires -- I'll never run my 206s there again).

Now, here's a question for the Net concerning tire temperatures on the BFG
"plug" tires.  I spent part of Saturday trying to optimize tire temps on the
BFG 206s.  I dropped a lot of pressure but was still getting higher temps
in the center.  Later I was told that the BFG "plug" tires (like the 205/55-14
which was created by putting a plug in the 185/60-14) will always run hot
in the center and that pyrometer data on these tires are useless.  Any
comments?

If I run the BFGs, I may have to realign my car.  Unlike the Yoko 205/55-14
RSIIs which run extremely hot on the shoulder, the BFGs tend to run hot on
the inside (especially the 224s).  If you are camber-limited, the BFGs may
be the ticket.

Subject:  '85 911:  Replacement Key for factory alarm FOUND

The factory alarm system for a '85 911 has controlled keys/blanks.

I've unsuccessfully called all over creation to try to get a second key
or blank, since I only got one when I bought my '85 this last winter.
The only option appears to be to shell out ~$75 for a new tumbler (with 2
new keys).  I finally broke my sole key a few weeks ago (bonehead!).

At my locksmith, he starts searching his key racks looking to make me a
replacement (Ha!).  Behold, he comes up with a blank that works!

The ID# of the blank that he got to work is YM22...a SAAB key, I think.
It took him a second try on the cutting machine to get it right, so it's
not perfectly straightforward, but it's a LOT cheaper.  $10 later, I had
*three* new alarm system keys.

Well, because they're the best?? Seriously, you can't do this with some

Subject: BFG Tires


Mike, 

The BFG people are correct, most "plug" tires do have that problem from 
the method of construction. On most tires, especially autocross or fast
slalom, the sidewall and shoulder temps will tell you more than the 
center anyway. 
This is as a result of the cornering loads placed on the tire. Autocross
and slalom put more abrupt loads on the suspension, causing the tires to
immediately load in the corners. The sisdewalls tend to heat and stay 
heated more than the center tread in a SS 944. Cars with power to light
the treads tend to blur the readings because of the traction issue, 
iseally you should run the tires in a straight line to determine the 
traction correction factor to adjust you cornering data.

All of this is moot is you have a stiff suspension set-up or trashed
shocks, etc. Generally speaking, across the spectrum of users, the BFGs
are as advertised. You feel and how your car responded as you drove it
are the most important factors. I used some trash Firestones 
successfully against the Yokohamas for sometime, it's whatever works 
when you're winning.

You are running in a Miata, which has some better front suspension than
a 924/944/968. You should be running about 3/4 to 1 degree of camber in the front with 4 degrees of caster and 30 minutes of toe in. Your rear
 should be 1 to 1 1/4 degree of camber and less than 30 minutes of toe 
in but more than 15 minutes of toe in. Try not to lower your car, use 
KONI sport shocks. Adjust the suspension after installation of the 
shocks. When setting up the front, insure that the fronts wheels are 
getting  camber gain on the outside wheel under load (requires a friend 
to watch). With this set-up you should get more footprint cornering and 
most wear on the inside of the tire.

Subject: HELP: buying 1986 911 Carrera

A Carerra will most likely need a clutch at that mileage. Figure $1000 -
$1200. Also be aware that the alternators are a failure point (generally go
between 60K and 80K miles). It's the brushes that go on the alternator, so
your warning light won't come on (I found out by being stranded with a fully
drained battery). Figure $500.

Motors are very durable if not chipped. I know of several AutoAuthority
chipped cars that have cratered (I'm sure some of you will have comments on
this).

Trans is extremely durable -- unless the car was thrashed, I doubt the syncros
are bad. The '86 was the final year for the fully developed and very debugged
915 box.  All the later 915s with beefed dog teeth are harder to shift.

I'd question why the combo of 15s and 16s, as 7s and 8s will fit in either
diameter -- a larger contact patch would be with the 16s....

You didn't mention price. I wouldn't pay over $20K for this car with the
current market.  In Houston, lower mileage cars are going for around $20K.

By all means, have ANY car you consider checked out by an independent and
reputable Porsche shop.

I am about to buy my first PORSCHE!

Please HELP me understand the level of commitment that this
purchase will entail....

The CAR: 1986 911 Carrera  ** 83,000 miles **. Equipped with AC, PW. PL.
door panel original alarm, has a whale-tail, rear tires 225x16
front 205x15 (7J and 8J I think). The car has the "aggressive"
turbo-look: black with black leather interior (all *cosmetics* in
first class shape). I am not all that thrilled with the "stealth"
look (perhaps I will undo the TAIL).

Technical concerns: The owner (one only) was a PCA member took good
care of the car (dealer maintained with records)! He did not have
any engine or *clutch* work done. This is one area of insecurity
for  me: the COSTS to come...for these items  I owned and worked on
English 2-seaters (MG, TR-4, and YES; Austin Healey, etc.).

The purchase circumstances were such that I was unable to do more
than test drive at moderate speed and look at it on a lift. It
drove very well a bit hard into 2nd gear (perhaps synchros will
need work). The car was traded in for a Corvette (Chevy Dealer!);
the interest level was very high (competing multiple Porsche philes
buyers in the same room). My decision was colored with desire.

Subject: RE: Titles, etc


The thing about frame straightening on a unibody is that the rippled or 
folded material has a point where the body will break. For a track 
vehicle that will only have a passenger compartment roll bar, I have a 
problem with that car.

When I built a pair of 914/6s for the track in the late 70s, I purchased
tubs that had had engine fires, but stayed away from a couple that had
burned badly enough to have buckled. Scorched is O.K., badly burned 
ignore. One tub had been hit in the front and had the front pan 
rearranged, I had it pulled knowing that I would be using a complete, 
full cage for the real work.

If you are going to weld in a cage, have someone knowledgeable with 
Porsche sheetmetal construction do it. The body structure will be pulled
out of line by the welding process. If you use a Thyssen steel chassis,
be advised that the flux material may have to be different than a normal
inert gas Chrome-moly tube frame. You WILL have to recheck all meaure-
ment points after the process and adjust the body structure accordingly.

This also applies to an undamaged tub. Remember, any point that you make
stiffer than the rest of the structure will have the load transferred to
it. Most of the cars I've built since those two cars had the tube 
frame built first, then the appropriate body panels added as necessary.
I never believed that SCCA really wanted "stock" vehicles in the 
production class anyway.

As far as title goes, it's a state issue. In california the smog Nazis
make you bring emissions  up to the year of the engine or the chassis, 
whichever is newer, whenever you  retitle a salvage, so be careful.

It brings up an interesting point, one could build a 1969 911T for SCCA
Vintage Trans AM out of a '89 or earlier Carrera tub which is much 
stronger. Just a few simple serial number changes......

Porsche dealers currently perform 90 point inspections on used Porsches to

Subject: RE: 944 engine mounts/buying a 911

Diagnosing bad 944 engine mounts:

	A quick seat-of-the-pants indicator of a bad motor mount is the level of vibration at low idle with no load on the engine.  It is most noticeable when the RPM reaches its lowest point after a quick rev with the cluth depressed.  Another test is coasting around a parking lot (motor running, cluth depressed, 10 mph).  When you straighten out after a 90 degree turn, and the vibration picks upsubstantially, you have a bad motor mount.

Buying your first 911: (again, mostly just my opinion)

- --83,000 miles is relatively high compared to competing cars available today.  My rule of thumb is 5000 mi/year.  Any more is a work/school car, and is over-exposed to the elements.  A lot less indicates a stored car, with its own special problems.
- --Does the car have a whaletail or a carrera tail.  The difference is critical in
determining OEM vs. aftermarket options.  A whaletail lip forms a tray on 3 sides, and the back of the base drops nearly straight down to the decklid.  A carrera tail lip curves up only at the back, and the base has a horizontal surface beneath the rubber lip.  The carrera tail can be a factory option.  The whaletail can be part of a special order option known as a turbo-body.  This option includes the whaletail, turbo bumpers (f&r), 9"&11" fender flares, turbo rockers, and turbo suspension pieces (a-arms, struts, torsion bars, sway bars, etc.), and turbo brakes.  A rule-of-thumb for factory turbo body options are the brake calipers and rotors visible thru the wheel centers.  If the rotors are cross-drilled, and the calipers are big, black, finned, and say PORSCHE in silver letters, its a factory job, or a good aftermarket job.  The only way to confirm this is to locate the vehicle paint/option code decal (location unknown) and cross-check the codes with a Porsche dealer's option catalog (not brochure).  Aft



ermarket cosmetic conversions can result in a number of different tails on the car, and are unfortunately all too common.  If the tail is a factory-installed item, recommend it stays with the car, or at least removed such that it can be replaced.
- --Tough shifts into second is no surprise at 83K miles.  All my 911's have had this problem prior to that distance.  Possibly the 2nd gear synchro, but probably the 1st-2nd gear slider, and naturally, more expensive.
- --'86 is a good year:  first 911 with a real air conditioner, last year for Euro Cars (I've had two, and no complaints), turbo-bodies were recognized for what they were, and were more common, but still rare.
- --'87 is my favorite (next to '91):  11 more HP with new DME map, G50 transmission with hydraulic clutch, and H7 headlights (much prettier).  No significant changes until '89 Carrera 4.
- --An '88 Carrera Targa w/45,000 miles, spoilers, black/linen leather, polished fuchs recently sold off my local VW dealer's lot for $17,500.  It needed a new muffler.

Stan,

You seem to be knowledgeable regarding 912 issues.  You mentioned the "heat
soak" problem to the guy with the 924 warm starting problem.  You said you
knew the fix for 356's.  Can you let me know?  I have some difficulty on
warm starts with my 912.  Usually though, if I depress the throttle to the
floor the warmed engine will start every time.  

I'd also like to know if there would be a substantial increase in acceleration
if I changed from 36mm Dellorto's to 40mm Dellortos or Webers.  It would be
even better if you knew of some modifications I could make to my 36mm Dellortos
to improve acceleration (Venturi, main jets, etc.).  I'm currently using
55 Idle Jets and 122 Main Jets.  I already have the 1720cc NPR kit installed.
I'm surprised that my 1600 lb Speedster Replica can't even keep pace with
my girlfriend's Mazda Miata (9.5 sec/0 - 60mph right?).  I don't know the
0 to 60 time for a 912, but it must have been VERY slow (12 seconds?).  I'm
guessing that my Speedster's acceleration time is around 10.5 seconds/0-60
even with the 1720cc kit.

One more question on distributors for the 912.  I've heard arguments for both
the Bosch 050 and the 009.  Harry Pellow (The Maestro) says the 050 is 
definitely the choice.  But I've heard other Porsche owners say the 050 will
destroy your #3 cylinder, because unlike the 009, the 050 does not retard
the spark on the #3 cylinder.  I guess the #3 cylinder runs the hottest on
356/912 engines.  Any thoughts on this subject?  By the way, I'm currently
using an 050.

Subject: 931ers where are you......


Long time no hear.....

An FOP (Frequently Occuring Problem) for ye all:
	Cracked J-Pipe.

The J-Pipe from the exhaust manifold to the wastegate of the 931 has a crack
around the flange which joins to the wastgate.  Is it possible to weld this
successfully.  If so I will pull it off soetime next week and get my father's
friend to do it for me.  Otherwise what is an alternative to fix it.

Also what are the symptoms of the cracked exhaust, does it cause increased
turbo lag, etc...

BTW: I had a problem with billowing smoke out of the exhaust for some time.
It used to belch out by the time I got to the traffic lights near my house, but
it did this only once per warm-up once the engine was warm it would not do it.
Anyhow after numerous embarrassments I noticed a whole puddle of oil that had
been dumped through the aif filter box.

My father and I had a look at it for a while and I pulled off a lot of the
polution lines.  We could get it to blow the smoke by placing a finger over the
recirculation line from the block.  Pressure would build up and I assume the
smoke was being forced out past the turbo seals.  At the same time oil would
back up from the sump out of the drain line to which the recirculation line
would match up at the purifier.  (the purifier is the little black cannister
which lets oil drain from the recirculation line back to the sump).  A line
goes from the purifier to the air filter box to recirculate the block gases.
Thus the cause of the smoking also causes the oil to back up to the air filter.

I cracked open the purifier and cleaned a lot of hardened junk of the walls
(which looks like oil buildup) and no blowing smoke since.... B-).
Ken has his purifier wired together, mine is duct taped together at the moment,
but it looks like ordinary PVC glue that is used to keep it together, I will
seal it for good on the weekend.  I would still like to rmeove and clean/check
the line which come from the block but it looks damn difficult to get to without
removing the intake manifold, or parts located similarly which block normal size
hand and digit passage.  Any suggestions????

We degreased the engine to see if any oil leaks returned and so far none (1.5
weeks).  But now my idle has started fluctuating again... B-(.  The boot from
the air filter to the fule distributor has a massive hole/crack in it (I have a
new one ordered but can't see this causing fluctuations as the air is coming in
before the air meter).  I didn't really toach electonics/fuel injection, maybe
some junk from the degreaing just got in somewhere....

Anyhow I will be spending Saturday removing some skin off my knuckles so I will
let you know what I come up with....

BTW (Gary): I repainted one of the door handles which was pretty bad and the
opening mechanism was pretty fatigued and consequently prbock - just sitting in
my had while cleaning with spirits mind you...  I have tried to get the part
here in OZ second-hand with no luck.  I cannot get the part new as I need to
buy the whole door handle....  Is it possible you could call PartsHeaven and
see if they have the piece - I will now try to describe it to you....

	OK it is the LH door handle.  Where you press the opening trigger it
	has a ball goint which goes into a little cast piece which then lifts a
	connecting rod to the opening/latching mechanism.  I want this little
	cast alloy piece, it is connected to the door handle by a small split
	pin which it rotates on.  If they possibly have it I will send a fax
	with a diagram (i used it here in OZ) and credit card details,
	basically I just want to find out if it is worth sending the fax first.

Thats about it for now, let me know what you guys are up to.....

We just transfered the title from my wife's Saab (1991 9000S) and took legal
posession of the 911 Carrera 1986 (83,000 miles). 

In my other LIFE I drove and fixed British cars. 

What should I do first in terms of preventative care: Inspect, change V-belts,
do minor/major tune-up (the engine hams without a "pause"), change the oil
again (what do you recommend -brand?), would you add Slick-50?? (or is it a NO

tire is new!)

Subject: RE Steve W Speedster Problems

My experiences with my Beck 550 might be of help to you.
First, cooling problems and oil temps. It's imperative that you locate the cause of the elevated temps.
After my cooler let go I found that it was improperly installed, blocking oil flow to the cooler.
Check it and the grommets before it's too late! Also make sure your shrouding is correctly installed (hopefully it's all there!).
Any leak around the spark plug boots and shrouding will elevate the engine temps.
Next check your timing - too much advance can be a cause of elevated temps and lousy offline acceleration.
I've no experience with the 050 dist. but the 009 seems ok and is retarded 3 degrees on #3. Make sure
(if you install one) that the number 1 mark on the dist is set up to fire on no. 1.
Otherwise you'll retard another cylinder and that doesn't do #3 anygood!
If your exhaust system isn't coated (jet hot or HPC) I'd recommend it as it 
really helps lower the engine compartment temp resulting in lower engine
temps - your engine will pull in cooler air this way. It helped my Beck
which has no engine campartment sealing. 

As for the Dell's - they publish a good book on them but you'll have to call
CB Performance for it (800/274-8337). They are good carbs and easy to rebuild
You can also install insulators under the carbs to help with your hot soak
prblem but if you lacate the cause of the higher temps that will help 
more than the insulators. I use em and they do work. They're made out of a 
high temp polymer and are about 1/8th" thick. Your fuel pump should have a
regulator (even the electric ones) as I've found they put out more than the 
rated 3 psi. In fact the Dell's like as low as 1.5 psi at idle. When you 
get the Dellorto performance book there's a section on how to change the 
venturi size and a chart based on engine displacement to locate the correct
venturi. I'd say form my experience you are probably in the ball park on 
venturi's. However the idle jets are ultra crit as most (80%) of driving is 
on the idles not mains. Too fat and off idle and mid range dies like you will
not believe! The mains are only in use at 3/4 to full throttle so they are
not as critical. Also float level is absolutley got to be right on. I had
mine to low and thought I had idel jet problems that I chased for a month.
When set up the carbs are good. Buy a Unisyn and sync left and right carbs 
as well as each barrel. This is described in the Dell book. Hope this helps
out.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my wheel bearing R&R question.
I now have a clear idea about the procedure and how to accomplish it.
One complication:

I ordered the parts from my usual supplier without asking which brand they
offered.  Normally I get OEM parts from them, but this time they sent me
SKF bearings made in Mexico.  I would like to find out more about the
quality and durability of these bearings before I put them in.  So far,
I've just used the car for street and autox, but would like to get to the
track as well, so I especially don't want to use inferior or questionable
parts here.  I'd appreciate a response from anyone with direct experience
or knowledge about SKF and other brands of bearings, so that I can better
decide whether to send these back or use them.

Subject:      Re: 912 engine problems


 Hi Steve,

 My '69 912 has similar starting problems and I also don't know why.
 It is really bad, when
 the car has been standing for a couple of weeks. Filling the carbs
 by revving the engine with the starter with disconnected ignition
 doesn't help very much.

 I rebuilt the engine about
 15,000 miles ago. It's stock except for NPR kit, 050 distributor, and
 disconnected throttle damper. The carbs are rebuilt original Solexes.

 I have no problems with the original fuel pump. Did you check it out
 of the car? It is easy to disassemble and to check. Has it been
 installed correctly including the insulator block?

 Regarding the distributor: I believe in what Harry Pellow says. The
 050 has much more advance than the 009 (30 deg instead of 20 deg,
 I believe) and is therefore much closer to the original distributor
 (33 deg). Since it is still less than original, there shouldn't be
 any problem.

 Best regards,

 Wulf

Kevin, 

Nice to hear from a fellow 924 Turbo owner. I've owned mine since new.

On your J-pipe, you can weld it, however, it will break at the other end
after a period of time. The reason is that the pipe is swaged into the 
small cast that acts as a flange to allow for expansion and contraction 
in use. Normal vibration will cause this to fail.

There is a cure, I reweld the broken pipe to the flange, then draw a 
straight line on the Bottom part of the J. I use this for an alignment
mark as then I cut the pipe. I then weld a collar(a piece of stainless
steel exhaust pipe enlarged or fitted to slip tightly over the J-pipe)
to one of the halves. I slip the other piece in and reinstall on the car
using a u-clamp to tighten the pipe to seal the passage to the 
wastegate. This allows for thermal expansion and some vibration 
isolation.

There is a modification to the breather system on the US cars, the line 
from the trap on the Turbo oil return was routed to the head to 
eliminate this problem, we had a recall, I'm not sure it extended out of
the US but the bulletin # was 83-01, 16 September 1983.

931 suspension is identical to 924 and 1982-1985 1/2 944s. The article
does cover everything there, but is directed to 924/931 owners.

Door handles and parts can be derived from Volkswagen Golfs, 1975 to 
1982, when you're in a pinch.

Private messages are O.K.

No way. You are going to have to lock the flywheel. You can improvise
and use a large screwdriver or prybar locked onto the teeth of the
ring gear, but it will require 2 people, one to lock the flywheel and
one to turn the bolt off with a breaker bar and cheater pipe if
necessary.

A word of advice to all 944/951 owners: Ask Kevin Gross all of your
questions soon because I predict he will forsake the marque and
finally buy himself a 911. Which means that he will no longer be
interested in providing part numbers of individual bolts and nuts,
VIN decoding services, paint codes, tech specs unavailable elsewhere,
tech bulletin transcriptions and other various and sundry information
on the 944 series. Why do I think this? Well from his recent postings
it is clear he has something brewing, why else would he be rebuilding
*two* 3.2 911 engines at the same time, a feat not attempted since
the late, great Mortimer Andial in 1922? He is studying, ladies and 
gentlemen, for his long-awaited debut 911 posting, "Child safety seats
for the 911SC". 

Be forewarned...

Subject: 944S2 89 - 91 differences

I seeketh the wisdom of the net:

Can anyone summarize the changes between the three model years that
the 944S2 was sold, 89, 90, and 91? 

I've found an 89 944S2 for sale. Asking price is $15k. Miles are 78K.
Dealer maintained. Owner has records but I haven't seen them yet, so 
I don't know if the typical water pump, clutch, etc. failures have
occurred. I'm assuming that if the owner had it dealer maintained, that
the timing belt was replaced as scheduled. As far as the mileage goes,
the owner lives 100 miles via interstate from work, one way. That would 
indicate that the miles are mostly of the highway variety. No accident
damage, either. Color is black on black leather, plus CD player.

What do you think of the price vs. condition (given minimal info) ?
  (July '93 NADA book says $14250 Trd-in, $17300 Retail)

What do you think of this car for autox and/or track use?

Would I be better off spending my $15k on a early 80's 911?

It's the insulating block that someone else previously mentioned. This was

Yup. That's about right. The 912 was *NOT* a very fast car, but it was a
spectacularly well balanced one. It's big problem was that it wasn't as
fast as either the 356SC or the early 911s (the obvious things to compare
it to at the time, right?). But people tried to drive it like it was anyway,
leading to some *AMAZING* engine failures. 

Something to remember is that the 912 engine made about 103 HP (SAE), and 
that even modified with the NPR kits, it will likely only make about 115 HP. 
You can trivially build a 130+ HP VW Type I engine, for about what you'd pay 
for a new 912 crank and set of pistons! Plus the VW has the offset "doghouse"
oil cooler, and a zillion aftermarket parts available. That's why most
Speedster replicas don't have 912 or 356 engines...

Use an 050 or an 031. The advance on the 009 is just plain wrong for the
356 engine (and isn't too great for Type Is in hot climates either, BTW).

One more thing: Duanne Spencer, a 356 vintage racer guy, has written a book
called "The 356 Performance Handbook". It's worth owning if you have a 356
or 912 from which you want more power.

   I'm trying to replace the timing belt on a 2v 928, and was wondering
   what is the best way to remove and install the huge bolt that connects
   the main pully.

   I think this bolt is like 28mm and the torque for tighening is like 300Nm!
   Do you think the compression of the engine is enough to counter act that
   much?

Ways I know of that work:
Put the car in gear with the brake on.

Put socket and breaker bar on (3/4" drive preferred ) with bar 
extending down below the car.

a; Brace yourself on the ground and push with your foot on the 
breaker bar (a kick or two should break it loose) or
b; hit the end of the breaker bar hard with a hammer a few times
in the right direction.

Remember to realign the timing marks before removing damper assembly.
If damper sticks and you don't have a puller just warm it with a propane
torch. It will slide off. A good hint is to take nail polish and
mark the cam drives before you remove the belt just for a sanity check
as the cams will 'pop' off their mark very easily and lead to some
confusion. It IS possible to have the crank pulley correct and the 
Cam pulleys 180o out with the belt on.

For retorquing use the reverse of method a;

A piece of pipe can be slipped over the torque wrench handle to give you
a little more leverage or you can put a 1ft drive extender 
(not an extension) between the torque wrench and the socket. This will
double the indicated ft/lbs. 

There may be an access hole in ther bell housing for locking the flywheel
but I was not able to discover one. ('79 928 )

john,

	what fun, eh? i did mine several years ago, but i'll pass along what i 
remember.

	i don't think the compression will hold the engine against this bolt. 
what i did was put all the spark plugs in, set the partking brake, and 
put transmission in 5th. then i blocked the rear wheels as well as i 
could, and used this to hold the crank. then i leaned on the bolt with 
a 24" breaker bar, both feet and some carefully chosen 4 letter german 
words :-).

	once you get the bolt out, you still have the problem of getting the 
pulley off. do you have a puller that fits?  i rented one, but it just 
*barely* fit betweent the pulley and the radiator. be very careful 
here, so that you don't dink up the radiator.

	one last admonition: double check the cam timing after you get it all 
back together, and get the belt tightened. i had my left cam one tooth 
off ( i don't remember which way) when i put camshaft seals in mine, 
and the engine started but ran really strangely. the nice thing is that 
the 2v 928 motors have clearance for the valves built into the motor; a 
mis-timing, or a broken belt won't cause major broken parts.

	good luck. if you need any other advice, drop me a note, and i'll see 
what i can remember about fixing mine.

Kelvin-  oil smoke and goo in the filter box - got that too.  I've always
figured that it means the turbo bearing seals are going on both the exhaust and
the intake side.  The stuff that leaks into the exhaust smokes, and the stuff
that leaks onto the intake side gets blown all through the intake/throttle

with the idle problems we've all been seeing lately -- the smoky exhaust can't

On my doors that cast piece is plastic.  On the passenger side that piece

I'm good. My car sucks.  I've decided to pull the engine and (at least) change

On my 931, the PCV return hose spews some gnarly looking oil-laden air
into the air cleaner when the car is hot.  This fouls the air filter
and, eventually, coats the whole air-mass sensor and intake plumbing

England" stamped on the three mounting flanges, so I'm questioning their
validity.  Maybe there was a company in England manufacturing these specifically
for 356's, because I don't think they'll fit on just any headlight.

Subject: Re: 914 column 


After removing the steering wheel, there are four (4) standard headed
screws that hold the switch assemblies in.  The heads are small, just
about 3mm in diameter.

On the other end of these assemblies is what keeps them from being 
removed easily.  There are two electrical connections (one for the
turn signals/lights and the other for the wipers) and the hoses for
the pnumatic window washers.  The electricals are easy, take note how
it should look and remove them (actually, this will take some work
while you are upside down under the dash, but...)  The hoses are a little
different.

If you don't have the washer stuff anymore, you can cut the hoses and
remove the switch assemblies.  Otherwise, relieve the pressure from the
system(!) and pull the switch assemblies out (stetching the hoses) enough
to get at the phillips head scress to remove the hose connections.

As for the contact for the horn, try to flex the copper part to make
better contact.

If you have to replace them, these parts look a lot like the same parts
that are used on VW Superbeetles.  Does anyone out there know if they
work?  Can the VW units (somewhat easier to find at a salvage yard) 
be used?

If you take an original, and severely modify it, I'll personally hunt
you down and kill you... in the nicest possible way, of course 8{)

Seriously, there were fewer 914/6s made than 356 Speedsters. Think about
it. Hard. Do you really want to destroy something that rare and beautiful
just for some more go-fast??? Particularly, when as you note, you can
get a lot more a lot cheaper by getting a conversion???

One of the things that Ghost Racing does is restore 914/6s, both for ourselves
and for customers. We own, at last count, 7 or 8 (depending on how you count 
the little box of metal numbers and matching title). Some are concours grade 
restorations. Some are "drivers" (one took 2nd in it's class at the Little 
Le Mans high-speed autox event this year). But all are meticulously original, 
at least where it counts -- transmission and engine numbers match the chassis 
build sheet, or where that's not possible, are at least from the 914/6 series. 
No visible updates except for Carrera chain tensioners and Weltmeister swaybars
on the "drivers" are applied. Paint and interior match the build sheet.

Anything that deviates from the factory build sheet is something that
could have been done in '70-71 with factory sanction and parts (like
there are two which had factory steel GT flare kits added after the
fact, but that was how most of the cars got GT flares, so it's OK).

And as such, these cars are worth something. As examples of how 914/6s
should actually go together. As examples of the breed. As about 1 - 1.5% of
the surviving 914/6s. 8{)

Another thing we do is build conversions, either for race or street.
And that's a whole different ball of wax -- those cars have value mainly
because of the engine, which is a $10K+ investment, typically.

>Thanks for your thoughts on this.

Hope I didn't put you off too much with my opening line, but I do have
*VERY* strong feelings about modifying 914/6s, or '73-4 2.0s, particularly
the '74 Special Edition. Anything that's rare should be left as it is so
it can be enjoyed by posterity.

Just my opinion - although I've never actually driven a 914-6:  Get a
conversion.  You should get a better performance/$$ ratio.  Save the
original 914-6s for those people who will keep them original.  I hate to
see the historical value of these cars needlessly destroyed.

Subject: my fuel injection problems



 As you all know (I think) I've been having problems
 with the fuel injection system on my 1.7l 914. It's
 been cutting out sporadically and coming back in just
 as sporadically. For a while I thought I had solved
 it (re-routing suspiciously poorly routed wires in the
 ignition system). Today, however, I was driving down
 the freeway and it started cutting out every 30 seconds
 or so (for several seconds at a time).

 I was at my wits end. My mechanic had thought it was
 a short in the wiring harness (because when he moved the
 harness around the motor cut out). I wasn't so sanguine.
 I considered a bad ground, a problem with the fuel injection
 trigger points, a flaw in the optically-triggered ignition
 (a retrofit item).

 The light finally dawned when I noticed that the car choked
 out a cloud of black smoke when it finally re-started after
 a low-speed cutout. A full rich condition was indicated.
 
 So I asked if there were any sensors or anything which could
 be malfunctioning. "Head sensor" was the immediate answer.
 So I fiddled with the head sensor while he sat in the driver's
 seat and lo and behold it (the fuel injection system) dropped
 out. Consistently. 

 So an oil change, a head sensor and $150 later I'm back on 
 the road. Drove into work and it works fine. Crossing my
 fingers that it solves the problem.

 Much better than replacing the harness.

 Thanks for all the net.advice..

Subject: 931 Grunge.



Mike, 

Some of the grunge is generated by Turbo blow-by and the remainder by 
compression blow-by. To find out which is the culprit, you must do a 
leakdown test on your engine. 5% or less is good on a Turbo. 
The test is accomplished by using a special gauge and pressurizing the 
cylinder when the cylinder is at it's TDC. The guage attaches through 
the spark plug hole. After pressurizing the cylinder, one waits per the 
gauge instruction and reads the residual pressure. The difference is the
percentage of leakage in the cylinder. Usually this indicates rings but
the valves contributes also.

I would suspect rings on the pistons and cylinder wall wear in your 
case, fortunately, these are the least expensive (hard to believe, 
isn't it) of all the Porsche Turbos to repair or overhaul.

Make sure that the breather modification was done to your car per 
bulletin 83-01. This mod directs the turbo breather up to the valve
cover area and not to the seperator.

The 931 does not have a crankcase pressure sensor, the dipstick should 
be tight anyway. If in doubt, buy a new on (o-ring kludges don't work 
there, the fit is wrong).

Goes for any car.  Vacuum leaks from the filler cap, dipstick, induction
manifold, and any other possible source of "false air" (ie, air which is
not metered) will mess up idle noticably and overall performance less

Yes: this is a very sensible thing to get.  There's a new book I'm reading,
"Motorsports Medicine," by Hunter & Stoff.  They identify the neck as the
most frequently injured part of the body in racing accidents.

I use what you would consider a "horse collar."  It's made by OMP, and
fastens at the front with a strip of Velcro.  I would say that it seems
quite adequate to the task.  But I can't offer comparative info wrt. other

Never!  It would give Stan far too much satisfaction!

I tore down two 3.2 motors last week 'cause one of them was our race
motor, which had a rod break.  The rod was made by CMW.  What can I say
here, and how strongly could I put it, without any risk of CMW suing
me?  We have had very negative experiences with CMW's rods, D-ported
heads, "holey" retainers (as in "holey sh*t, I can't believe they charge
good money for this"), etc.  Anyways, the rod went through the side of
the case big-time, the head shattered into four big and many little
pieces, two rockers snapped, crank damaged, piston smoked, sniff!

And the other engine got torn down to give its life to the race engine.
The good news is that, as of this evening, the bottom end is done and
the top end is about half done.

So we blew up the 911 that Thursday before the Bridgehampton race.  I,
meanwhile, drove my trusty water-cooled steed that day without a hiccup.
And we're talking alternating 30-minute lapping sessions from 10 in
the morning to 6 that evening in 100+ degree weather.  I was not gentle.
Sell this car?  I think not.

Having said all that, my wife would dearly love us to own a nice black
911 coupe.  Actually, I want the coupe part.  She just wants the triple-
black 911 part of the spec.  And I'd love to own one too.  So if you

Although Black cars are hotter to the touch in the sun, recent studies here

the interior temperature of the vehicle. The Interior heat is caused 
primarily by the radiated heat through the windows. If you cover the windows 
 while parked.and crack open the sunroof or a window, you can lower the temp 
quite a bit but you probably know that already.

Subject: 911 Torsion Bar Bushings

A couple tricks I learned while doing this recently:
Burn (yes, with fire) off the old bushings from the spring plates.  This is
simple: use a propane torch or even lighter fluid to start the rubber burning.
Make sure you place the spring plate outdoors in a spot where leaving a mark
on the ground won't matter (the rubber becomes molten and can drip). Wait until
the flame is completely out (make sure the bushing burns all the way too). Just
ashes will be left which are easily wiped off.

Clean the spring plate and it's corresponding bushing hold-down plate on the
bushing contact surfaces (if there is rust, remove with fine emery cloth).

I used a good coating of anti-seize as the lubricant on the bushing.

Make sure the new torsion bar is COMPLETELY coated with a thin layer of grease.

Once assembled, make sure there is NO binding of the spring plate.

I have a '72 that sees similar use. I found the combination of 22mm front, 27mm
rear torsion bars, with 22 mm sway bars front & rear works best.  I've tracked
and AX'd the car and can handle drives up to 200 miles or so (it IS stiff).

I have a combination of Sport Bilsteins up front and adjustable gas Koni's
in the rear (set to medium).

The Weltmiester bushings I used are the hard ones, and they just started
creaking after trailering the car to Parade and Evansville Nat'l Tour event.
(about 2300 miles of trailering).  Don't know why the creak, but it isn't
bothersome -- it is a race car after all.  I'm more interested in performance
than comfort, so you may want to opt for new or good used springplates or
the Weltmiester adjustable units.  I know of several people that use them
with no complaint of noise (the bushings wear in a couple of years, though).

Good luck.         -Scott

Subject: Kids and Interior heat.


The radiated heat in a closed car is UNBELIEVEABLE! Will Hartje is 
correct in how to disperse the heat to save the interior.

I recall that someone complained about the leather on their 928 dash 
"cooking" and going away. Test have shown that on a 90 degree day in 
direct sunlight in a closed car, the dash on a 944 can have a surface 
temperature of 250 degrees. That will melt most plastics in an hour's 
exposure.

By cracking the windows and using a car cover the effects can be 
minimized but mot eliminated. Over time, even a well protected and cared
for 924/944 dash will go away.

I use Armor-all for my dashes, seems to work. My turbo is original after
11 years, the 924 was replaced when I bought it 18 months old in 1982 
and is still in great shape. I know that the replacements are up to $700
and are no better that the originals. This is one of those bitches I 
have  with Porsche, you know you put out an inferior piece on the car, 
yet  you make the cost unbearably high on a cosmetic item that greatly
affects the value of the car for the owner. In this case, they haven't 
earned a repeat sale to that customer. I bet marketing wonders why I 
won't buy a new Porsche anytime soon, I need the value of the 
depreciation  to justify the purchase and pay for the repair of the 
badly done pieces when the car is two years old.

Anyway, use of the car cover and opening the sunroof/opening the 
windowsa crack helps a lot to keep the interior from going to hell in 
the heat.

made of that wouldn't retain heat so well.  Maybe next year :)  Anyway,
if somebody has a simple solution to putting in a re-circulation gizmo

ecstatic.

Back again...

Jim mentioned ArmorAll as a help for dashes that have to withstand
extreme temperatures.  Anybody who how to get to goo off of the
windshield after you put ArmorAll on the dash?  The dash cracked 
horribly anyway, and now the windshield has the byproducts of the 
ArmorAll that was previously applied to the dash and then, well, 
cooked.  I know a new windshield is one solution :) but I would 
prefer something a bit less expensive.

Subject:      924 warm start

Forget who mentioned the commonalities with the Scirocco, but I think he
may be bung on. I have had this problem with the 931 on and off for quite
some time. It's easy to troubleshoot the check valve at the fuel pump end.
Run the car. Shut it off. Immediately clamp the fuel line downstream from
the pump. Wait the required amount of time for the problem to usually
occur. Have someone unclamp the line as you attempt to restart it. I'd almost
take bets that the check valve at the pump is not faulty. I've been there.
The idea of fuel leaking at the injector end of the system sounds more
likely to me given the way my car has been checked out. The 924 injectors
do indeed just pop out of their holders (unlike 931 threaded versions) so
that is another easy thing to check. If the fuel accumulator doesn't
have fuel leaking through the side of it, I am told it is very unlikely
to be at fault. (Comes from a handful of useful tidbits put out through
Auto Atlanta -Thanx Paul). Otherwise, you are in for a thorough methodical
piece by piece test of the whole fuel system. Not as bad as it sounds.
The warm up regulator is a simple little thing that you can easily test
 -refer to Haynes manual for example.  Last resort: Change the air in the tires
;-)

Several Companies sell Solar powered fans. I thought Jc Whitney & Co, used to
sell one but I don't see it in there latest catalogue. I use
mine with a car cover. Just have to put a small hole in it for the wire to
go through. I place the solar panel on the roof, fan inside. You can also
buy battery powered fans to move the air.

The radiated heat in a closed car is UNBELIEVEABLE! Will Hartje is
correct in how to disperse the heat to save the interior.

I recall that someone complained about the leather on their 928 dash
"cooking" and going away. Test have shown that on a 90 degree day in
direct sunlight in a closed car, the dash on a 944 can have a surface
temperature of 250 degrees. That will melt most plastics in an hour's
exposure.

By cracking the windows and using a car cover the effects can be
minimized but mot eliminated. Over time, even a well protected and cared
for 924/944 dash will go away.

I use Armor-all for my dashes, seems to work. My turbo is original after
11 years, the 924 was replaced when I bought it 18 months old in 1982
and is still in great shape. I know that the replacements are up to $700
and are no better that the originals. This is one of those bitches I
have  with Porsche, you know you put out an inferior piece on the car,
yet  you make the cost unbearably high on a cosmetic item that greatly
affects the value of the car for the owner. In this case, they haven't
earned a repeat sale to that customer. I bet marketing wonders why I
won't buy a new Porsche anytime soon, I need the value of the
depreciation  to justify the purchase and pay for the repair of the
badly done pieces when the car is two years old.

Anyway, use of the car cover and opening the sunroof/opening the
windowsa crack helps a lot to keep the interior from going to hell in
the heat.

Subject: 914 cages/PCA legal



Hey there everyone,

I just got the quote for an Autopowers rollcage for 
my 914, and I have a few questions:

1. where are they located?? Cause shipping is expensive!!!!

2. Any problem's with 914 cages in general, and Autopower's in particular??

3. I wanted to initally run in pruduction class PCA. I was 
   told that the Autopowers cage was a "structural cage"
   ie. the cage attaches to the shock towers. Is this accurate,
   and is it temporarily(sp?) avoidable??

4. I would prefer to have a mild steel cage, as apposed to 
   a chromoly cage. Does anyone have any experience to deter
   me from this idea.  ie. That's what I lack.


Hope it's not too much. Forgot to say that I have ofcourse
read the PCA rulebook thought I have not memorized it. What 
I should really have asked is wether or not I could, purposely 
not install the links to the shock towers, so as to make me 
production class legal, and later if I make it put the rest in.

cheers

Subject: Armor-all


The favored method at the moment for removal of Armorall from the 
windshield and other glass in my garage is Dupont wax and grease 
remover (extreme cases) in a clean cloth rubbed on all areas of the 
glass. You will note the grunge that comes off. On hot days when the 
A/C is used there is some outgassing from the vinyl when the cool air
makes the vinyl contract, this hits the glass also.
Next, I use a window cleaner (Gunk brand, it's cheap) and wipe the 
residue from the wax and grease remover.
Lastly, I wipe the glass with a very damp (water) rag, then wipe before
it drys until the glass is nice and sparkles.

Read the Armorall instructions, apply it, then wipe off ALL excess, I 
usually rub it until there isn't a film. Do not leave a wet film, it
attracts everything like a magnet. Used correctly it isn't bad, it does 
retard deterioration.

I try a lot of different things for polish and concours prep, some work,
quite a few aren't worth the money. My current favorite for tire prep
is No-Touch when I prep with the wheels off the car. It gets in the 
tread and `floats' most of the grunge out. Makes a worn tire look 
pretty new. I don't like getting that stuff on the paint, it leaves 
smears when you wipe it.

Subject: 911 Top End Noise


I am looking for suggestions relating to a problem with my 1977 911S. A while
ago I took the 911 to a higher speed than was usual. Shortly there after I
noticed a very metalic noise comming from the area of the cam chain housing
of number 4 cylinder. Thinking I had lost a tappet I removed the top cam cover
but alas all was well. I removed the cam chain cover and with the exception 
of the chain rails all was well. Perhaps it was the chain and rails! I took the
opportunity to replace the rails and at the same time fitted later pressurised
chain tensioners. To my dismay when I restarted the engine the noise was still
there. So out came the engine. I stripped the right cam housing and checked
it. All ok! About this time I read an article describing the noise one gets
when a cylinder/head stud breaks. The description seemed similar. So I checked
the torque on all cylinders, some were low by a few ft.lbs so I re-torqued. I
had rebuilt the engine myself some 3000 miles earlier and had case inserts
fitted. The studs are however the originals. The only other observation I can 
make is that I noticed slight abrasion on the chain on the outer side on just
a couple of links. The engine is now sitting on the garage floor awaiting its
return to the car. Not satisfied that I have fixed it I just can't bring myself
to put it back. The only alternative I can come up with is to progressively 
strip the engine. Which of course I will have to do if the noise persists. My
reluctance to strip the engine is partly the time and effort and that I would
feel compelled to replace the oil pump with a higher capacity unit, chains etc
and on a 74-77 engine I'm not sure I want to invest the cash although the
general condition of both car and engine with only 69k miles is good.
Any comments??????

Subject: The Real SteveW Speedster Info File

Opps. Sorry everyone, the SteveW fiel I've been trying to get to him for
hours is jinxed. I apologize for the garbage.

One more time.

Steve:

Some additional thoughts on the Speedster problems.

#1	I'm in agreement re the HP issue with Stan. However since your
Speedster should be lighter than the 912 was your power to weight ratio 
will be more advantageous. I think with the proper carb jetting and ignition
you'll come closer to the Miata.

#2	After thinking overnight onthe fuel/carb/hotsoak/starting/running
and performance issues a couple of other ideas came to mind. The bulk of 
your problems stem from excess heat and fuel. The engine ducting/shrouding
is important. i don't know what you have done re the heater and ducting but
the factory manual states that the engine will overheat in a big (destructo)
way without the proper back pressure provided by the heater ducts. In fact
they show a reducer that can be fabbed to produce the back pressure (dwell)
required for the airflow to be optimized over the heads. Can Fax this if you
like.

#3	You really must run a regulator, all the electrics put out too much
pressure for Webers or Dells. The Dells in fact like as little as 1.5 PSI
at idle. Put one on - instant big difference. Additonally the hot soak is
causing the fuel in the float bowls to expand and push past the factory
needle/seat assy. The previously mentioned insulators will ehlp but until
you get to the root cause of the elevated engine temp it's only a stopgap.
CB also has a rotary fuel pump with pressure relief line back to the fuel
tank to help withthe fuel expansion problem. Youmight also consider the 
ball/needle/seat assy sold by Berg that's superior to the factory part and
as an added benefit lets you run higher float levels benefitting fuel flow
into the emulsion tube well for better off line perf.

#4	Timing. If your's is to far advanced off line will be weak and the
engine will overheat. all air cooled engines run about 1 point over stated
CR that means 9.5CR=10.5. with today's fuel that is marginal at best. What
you want is optimum cyl charge to cool the head and jugs without too much 
fuel. If we retard the timing the bigger charge will cool the cylinder but
performance will suffer. With advanced timing you will destroy the engine
and you won't even hear the pinging! So to strart set the timing at factory
specs (static method) and then play with all the other variables.

If you do that, then put on the pressure regulator, sync the carbs and so 
forth it should start to come into line.

Oh, if the engine is back firing during trailing or partial throttle decell
the idle jets are partially blocked and need to be blown out. You probably
have a filter in place and it should be replaced if any doubt exists to it's
effectiveness. i like the clear onesyou'd never believe the junk in the gas
today.

Finally, if everything gets dialed in and it still doesn't run the only other
solution I know of is to buy a drum of 114 octane race fuel (got mine after
Sebring) and cut it 50/50 with pump fuel. Sometimes depending on who built
your engine they get the CR up too high and there's no other cure short of a 
rebuild.

BUt cheer up I don't think we have to do that just yet!

After driving for an extended period of time (when the engine has

fifteen minutes, the car has a problem starting.  It seems to be
leaning out of fuel.  After a few cranks and waiting a minute, the
car will start but runs roughly(seems to be leaning out..?!)  After
running fora while, the car returns to its normal running state.  This
has been a frustrating problem for the past three weeks.  I took the car
in to a local mechanic who said the car was running lean and adjusted 
the air-fuel ratio.  This seemed to help for a few days only.  Please help.

John -

Could you be more specific about the metallic noise?  We talking single
clunks or continual grinds?

Given the wear, when you rebuilt the top end did you restore the shims
properly to the correct cams?  There is a procedure for checking the
cam sprocket offsets.  Generally you don't need to do it during a rebuild
if you restore the shims and sprockets to their original location, I
believe.  When we take an engine apart, we put put a cable tie through
the hardware for a given side, and scribe an "L" or "R" on the sprocket.

Subject: 911 Torsion Bars - Continued

    Scott-  (any anyone else)

    Thanks for your suggestions- I will follow your advice and let
    you know how the project goes.  I do have a couple more questions
    for you (or anyone else out there) on this suspension thing.

    1- Any suggestions on setting the ride height once I've changed
    the bars?  (I am going to be using stock spring plates)

    2- How about camber, toe-in, and alingment in general- I presume I
    will have to have that reset but can I run it as is for a few days
    with out too much tire wear/damage?

    3- I have adjustable Konis on the rear, can I stiffen these
    up enough to compensate for the heavier torsion bars (from 23mm to
    26mm)?  Also, how do I adjust these, do I just push them in all
    the way and turn?  How much do I turn?

    4- I have not secured a set of front torsion bars yet so I will be
    running the stock ones (19mm) until I have.  I understand that
    with an increase in the rear stiffness but none in the front I
    will be increasing the oversteer tendency of my car- is this true?
    If yes, with his setup is it a serious (i.e. "dangerous") increase
    or something I'll be able to deal with?

    5-  On the issue of front torsion bars, any ideas were I can get a
    set of used 21 or 22mm bars?

    Thanks for your comments/suggestions-

Subject: stained wheels

I have a '79 911SC with the 16" wheels denoted by a brushed aluminum ring
around a black 5-spoke??? center. (I don't know the technical term for
these wheels). A while back (3-4 weeks), while the car was in for service,
they "cleaned" the car and used this tire dressing stuff to make the tires
black. Well, a few days later I notice a white-ish film all over the brushed
aluminum rings. I've tried a number of products to remove this stuff -
nothing has worked completely.

Has anyone ever had this problem with these wheels - and (dis) solved it?

Subject: warm starts


	   I am actually posting this for a friend of mine who owns a
   1980 911 SC (European model, 3.0L)....

   After driving for an extended period of time (when the engine has
   been heated up for a while) and the car is parked for over
   fifteen minutes, the car has a problem starting.  It seems to be
   leaning out of fuel.  After a few cranks and waiting a minute, the
   car will start but runs roughly(seems to be leaning out..?!)  After
   running fora while, the car returns to its normal running state.  This
   has been a frustrating problem for the past three weeks.  I took the car
   in to a local mechanic who said the car was running lean and adjusted 
   the air-fuel ratio.  This seemed to help for a few days only.  Please help.

Check the residual system fuel pressure by tapping a gauge into the
fuel system between the warm-up regulator and the fuel distributor.
You may have a defective fuel pump check valve which is allowing
system pressure to bleed off as the car sits for a few minutes. The
fact that cranking solves the hot-start indicates renewed fuel
pressure after the fuel pump activates at each turn of the ignition
key.

Another way to check is to jump 12V to fuse #4 (I believe this is
correct for the fuel pump) as the car is sitting and leave it running
for a few minutes while the car is off. Then try a hot-start and if it
fires right over, you definately have a leaky fuel system pressure.

Then adjust car back to proper air/fuel ratio...

Subject: 911 Top End Noise


   Given the wear, when you rebuilt the top end did you restore the shims
   properly to the correct cams?  There is a procedure for checking the
   cam sprocket offsets.  Generally you don't need to do it during a rebuild
   if you restore the shims and sprockets to their original location, I
   believe.  When we take an engine apart, we put put a cable tie through
   the hardware for a given side, and scribe an "L" or "R" on the sprocket.

In addition to Kevin's recommendation:

With regard to cam sprokets, make absolutely *sure* that you put the
cam sprokets on in the proper orientation. Although the cam sprockets
are identical, one of them goes on with the convex side *out* and the
other goes on with the convex side *in*. Check the manual for the
exact details. If you accidently put the both on the same way,
everything might *look* OK but if you didn't measure sprocket offsets
like Kevin says then your chains will die a grinding death eventually.

Push them in *all* the way and then turn clockwise until you can't
turn anymore. When you get to this point you are at maximum stiffness
(or vice-versa I can't remember). Then turn all the way counter-clock
while pushing all the way in and *count the turns* until you reach the
stop again. Now you have some idea how many turns there are
lock-to-lock. If you turn but never reach the end then you aren't
pushing in hard enough. It takes a while to get a feel for it.

       4- I have not secured a set of front torsion bars yet so I will be
       running the stock ones (19mm) until I have.  I understand that

Depending on the combo (you say 19/26) you might render the car
undrivable on high speed turns, unless you actually *like* backing
into your accidents or you want to experiment with a  bit of 
agricultural racing!  Then again sideways can be fun (not fast)

the frog? hmm... mine is nicknamed The Pig, mostly due to its rather

anyway, i'd go stainless if you can afford it. beware that if you go 
with ANSA or Bursch, you may wind up with a car that is loud and 
'boomy' at low rpm, esp. idle.
i have an ANSA rear muffler on mine, and i can hardly stand to drive it 
into a parking garage. at speed (>2k rpm) it sounds OK, but i like the 
oringal muffler with its 'sleeper' sound.

i think brian allman of northstar motorsports quoted me about $1700 for 
a borsch stainless, from the cat back, for my 928. if you're not too 
concerned about originality, you might see if you can find someone who 
does custom exhaust work and see what he can build for you. i saw a 928 
once that had a standard oval muffler of some sort stuffed the back 
left corner, instead of the steel dumpling, and it sounded almost like 
original.

good luck.

I guess I've been on this mailer a while.  The issue of ArmorAll was

Protectant.  I don't have the particulars here but I got it and tested it
against ArmorAll side by side before putting it on my "like-new" '84 944.
303 is a superior product (thanks to those who make it and those on the net
who pointed me to it).  I went around the house reclaiming all kinds of
vinyl things.  I divided an old briefcase 1/2 303 and 1/2 Armorall.  A month
later the 303 1/2 still looked new.  I'll bring in the spec and forward them

This is always an interesting subject, Yves. Many Porsche enthusiasts
object to hacking at original 914/6's, and that's fine. I don't quite
liken the crime to melting down an original Roman sword haft to make a

But what really facinates me is the argument from original 914/6
owners that goes like this:
"Don't make a conversion 4->6 because you will be using parts such as
exhaust, oil tanks, engine sheet metal, etc., which will subtract from
the available pool of parts that can be used to sustain the original
sixes."

So you see either way you're gonna offend someone down the line. Best bet is
to take all original  914/6's and seal them in a converted aircraft hangar

Hmmm. Premature mail emission. 8{)

I was saying that figuring how to get the rear hoop braces to 
terminate on the shock towers isn't looking like much
fun at all. If you do it the obvious way, you have to relocate
the circuit board with the relays and stuff, at minimum. And
you may impair access to the engine as well. I dunno, but since this

>2. Any problem's with 914 cages in general, and Autopower's in particular??

Well, they don't fit right (i.e. you can't put the top on) if installed the 
way they should be installed (i.e. legs terminate on the door sills), and 
aren't bent right to install the other way (i.e. legs terminate on the 
floor)... I usually solve this by bending things so that the legs terminate
on the floor, but touch the vertical part between the floor and door sill,
then weld all metal-to-metal contact points for maximum stiffness.

Not on the 914. It's a four-point cage. Note that *ALL* of the shock
towers are inaccessible from inside the passenger compartment, and that
it's pretty hard to get to them in general (engine compartment in  way
going to the back, gas tank to the front). Unlike, say, any of the 
waterpumpers...

Do the mild steel. For starters, chromoly is illegal in SCCA and I think

Subject: Kermit the 928

Hi Guys, 

There is a very tired looking 928 in the San Jose area with Audi-X
stencilled on the side. No, it isn`t an AMC product masqurading.

About 928 exhausts, years ago I took the cat off a 928 with the rest of
the  exhaust system. I used two 27" glasspacks reversed where the cat 
went and a pair of Corvair turbo mufflers where the original tin can 
went. I connected the two tracts at the 24" point with a crossover, 
this is about 6" ahead of the glasspacks. Worked very well and was 
quiet until top revs were hit. About a 15 hp increase on the chassis 
dyno. The 928 was a '79.  The reversed glasspacks cut the resonance and the tendancy to pop under deacceleration. They also balance the CIS by
providing a little backpressure.

I replaced the rubber bushings on the rear spring plates of a 69 911T
with the Weltmeister "softer" bushings. 

A sharp kitchen knife was used to cut off the bushings, and a wire
wheel on a drill cleaned off the small pieces.   

>From my experience, the aftermarket bushings WILL squeak. 
I even spirally grooved one of the bushings before smearing in grease 
and it still squeaked.

The bushings should come with a strong "squeak" disclaimer.  

Some time ago, someone mentioned that zerk fittings can be added to allow later
regreasing of front bushings.  For the rear bushings, zerk access
to the inner bushing would probably require a grease access hole
to be drilled through the spring plate.  Maybe someone has done this.

Have you considered swapping the left/right spring plates?  The rubber
bushing's wear surface is the top, so you should have a relatively
good bottom on the stock spring plate's rubber bushings.  
The loading on the internal splining of the spring plates will reverse
direction, I don't know if this is a problem.  

I talked to one owner who used the swap method and was happy with the results.
But I have no experience with it myself.

Subject: 914/6 Hacking


John, 

The source for the quotation in your Email Is me, I engaged in a running
arguement with John Goodspeed about his conversion kit. I have done 
conversions  myself using wrecked 914/6s for the source, I prefer the 
original method for mounting the engine in the chassis. I consider these
cars rebodies rather than conversions as there is a provision for an 
extensive unit-body replacement in the Cal Vehicle code. All of these 
cars were for track use.

At the time (about 1976), heat exchangers were about $290 each, pretty 
steep. There weren't any oil tanks excepting the limited supply of
Sportomatic tanks built and not used. Porsche's attitude was that they
wer not interested in producing parts for a discontinued unsuccessful
model. At the time, there were some parts, maybe enough for 150 cars in
critical areas. So, if you used all this stuff for counterfit 916/6s, 
then what was i supposed to do when I needed parts. Goodspeed was
creating a run on the only source I had to support my 914/6.

Fortunately, in the wacko world of Porsche, a few Southern california 
guys started making and seeling all these pieces except copies of the 
heat exchangers. Porsche's continuous raising of prices has insured that
fewer people will buy genuine parts from them. Have you checked the most
recent price of those heat exchangers thqat were built in 1979?  

The quote can be found in one of the Upfixin' books. Some remembrance 
for posterity.

Wait a minute, theres a good idea here. Why don't we get Porsche to 
buy the MR2 from Toyota. I understand they are about to cease 
producing it. The price has got to be cheaper than the development
costs for the Boxster. They/we get a proven product, great engine
great mid-engine handling, could be mistaken for a Porsche if
it had the right badges. A level of sophistication equal to or
better than 944/951. Best of all, even after adding extra $$$ for
"fine old world engineering", it would sell for under $30K. It
probably wouldn't break often enough to satisfy the after-market,
but you can't have everything.

Sure. And it's also *EXPENSIVE* to get original 914/6 stuff to use in
a conversion. So, *DON'T*. Use real racing-grade oil tanks, and Aeroquip
lines with the Pegasus 911-to-AN-fitting adapters. Use the fiberglass
"sheet metal" kits. Use the "Quick-Six" mounting bar. This is *NOT*
a hard problem. And, interestingly enough, you wind up with a *BETTER*
car than the original 914/6.

So you really can do this, and not piss anyone off. And get a fun car.
Cheaper than if you'd done an "authentic" conversion or started with
a real 914/6!

Thanks Jim, but where were ye when I really needed ya?

This thread brings up a few things that have been eating me.

How much rustoration can a 914 withstand and still be considered OK for
autoxing?  Assuming of course the work was done well.
After seeing Matt's thread about his amateur repairs and relegating his 914
to ICE RACING only (but dont track or ice racing create the same loadings?).
How amateur and what was repaired?

At a recent tech session, Bernard Von Nolting (of 356 restore fame in FRG.)
was asked why he gas welded everything.  His reply was gas welding left the
steel as 'soft' as original and MIG welding 'hardens' the affected zone.

I have heard of this before, but the hype claims MIG is good for anything.
What is the truth?  Are we splitting hairs?

Having done the most on a 914 [in the whole world?] with respect to rust
repairs, I used both oxy-acetylene and mig as needs dictated.
There are times when a torch just makes things worse, that's when mig
to the rescue, then finish with the torch to smooth and penetrate.

After three years of effort, am I in for a letdown since my tub is 80%
MIGged?  Will my car toast me the first time it hits something harder
than a deer?  

One last item:
The body stiffener kit weltmeister offers for 914's...
Are ALL the plates neccessary?
Reason I ask is, i can beleive flexure at the inner top of the wheel well
and a reinforcment plate for it, but the 'boxing' plates for the suspension
and engine mounts -that area is fairly robust, does it really need the
extra stiffness?   I suppose I can 'heat-n-beat' the bastards in place...
Its already two thicknesses of steel and 3 in some places (trust me i know).

Later peops.

Subject: Top End Noise (911S)

Thank you for your suggestions. Both reasonable but both already checked. The 
noise sounded like a tappet had backed off really badly or a cam lobe had
been damaged. The other thought I had was that one of the cam shaft retaining
plate bolts had come loose and was just touching the back of the spocket, 
but no. I forgot to mention that three of the rocker arm ball joints were just
starting to get flat spots. They're now replaced. Apart from the noise there
didn't seem to be anything wrong with the engine. It was driven carefully 
a few miles making the noise. 

On a different subject. Living in Arizona I have a problem with the engine
running hot in the summer. The car is fitted with the standard cooling pipe 
under the front fender. I should say was. I fabricated a cooler from a couple
of VW auxillary oil coolers. It improved the running temerature some but I
would like it lower. Has any one sucessfully used an aux oil cooler with
100+ temperatures on the 74-77 engine? The engine oil cooler is clean, clear
and in good shape. The temperature diverter valve under the rear fender was
re-built. The Fan on the car is an 11 blade. It is equiped with air
conditioning but the compressor belt is removed. It is run on synthetic
oil for the added temperature margin. This car is non-catalytic, has an air
pump and no egr.

Umm.  If you're *REALLY* doing a swap to 911S, including the vented
rear rotors, then you have a surprise coming.  It is *NOT* as simple 
as it looks. The vented disks are quite a bit thicker than the solid 
ones, and as a result, you have to put spacers in your rear calipers. 
Of course, once you find/fab a spacer you have a *BIGGER* problem, 
since the little rubber O-rings that seal the caliper halves are NLA 
and you'll need a second set too (one for each caliper/spacer interface). 
You also have to machine some amount off of the diameter of the disk. 
Somewhere I have the exact dimension, but that shouldn't be too 
hard -- just measure a solid disk and match calipers. You also have to shim
the calipers from their mount points too, something like 1/2 the thickness of
the spacer you add between the caliper halves, for obvious reasons.

If you're keeping solid disks in the rear, you just drop the new one on
and don't have to do anything to the caliper.  And, as a time-saving hint,
you can use 912 disks again having to remove some from the diameter.  *BUT*, 
if you drill the hub for 5-bolt instead of using real 914/6 hubs, and it's 
not a '70 hub with the majik reinforced lumps where you are supposed to drill 
for 5-bolt, you may have hub failure at some point when you least need it 
(if it's a track/autox car that get stressed a lot).

The front is a routine bolt-on operation. You just swap (at minimum)
the struts and reconnect the brake lines. You *can* also (and should
it it's possible to do so) swap the A-arms, the steering rack, and the
brace at the same time. Just un-bolt the top of the strut, unbolt the
A-arm mounts, and disconnect the steering. In-and-out.

Wooden dashs were not offered as options on any 914s, even 6s, from 
what I can tell. In general, wooden dashes were things found in luxury
cars, *NOT* sports cars, until the exotic and semi-exotic cars started
turning into GTs and not road-going versions of race ready cars. And
that really didn't start until the mid-70s.

The 914 also fell most decidedly into the "economy" part of the Porsche
product line. It's not logical that they would have offered leather interior
or wood dashes on main production cars. However, both seem to have found their
way onto the "family" cars and some of the 916s.

My guess is that if it *IS* original, then it's one of the Peich family cars
that got loose and drifted to the US. But best guess is that it is one of 
those numerous aftermarket conversions done way back in the sands of time,
possibly when the car was nearly new. Only the factory cardex can tell us
for sure...

Sorry for the late reply - I've been travelling for a week.

The passenger switch runs as a slave to the driver's side window 
switch.  A defective driver switch could still operate the passenger 
window but would inhibit direct passenger operation.  Alternatively, 
you could have a bad passenger switch too - try flipping them all 
around and see what happens (they're interchangable).

Subject: Camber on a 1971 911

    The saga continues...

    I conquered replacing my rear torsion bars on my 1971 911
    (from 23 to 26mm) and installed new Weltmeister bushings
    (performance) and lowered the rear of my car.  John and Scott,
    thanks for your advice- the project went smoothly but did take a
    while.

    My newest problem is that after lowering the car the camber on the
    rear is screwed up.  The passenger side wheel is much more
    negative (probably at least 3 degrees negative) while the drivers
    side is probably 1 degree negative or maybe closer to Zero
    degress.  I recall when I had the suspension set last year that
    the guy said my negative camber setting was maxed out on my
    driver's side, but I believe I had at least a couple of degrees
    negative (I don't remember the passenger's side setting- I guess
    this will prove to me that I need to keep a log book!).  My
    suspicion at the time was that the driver's side banana/trailing
    arm was distorted (I had replaced both of the original arms with
    arms off a 1971 S so I would have the mounts for the sway bar).

    I understand that lowering the car decambers the wheels- and the
    before and after passenger side camber settings seems to support
    this.  But, does anyone have a clue as to why the driver's side
    wheel does not support this "decamber theory."  I adjsuted the
    camber ecentric bolts on both spring paltes but for the most
    part have not cured anything.  Is is possible that the
    driver's side trailing arm was screwed up and now as the car is
    lowered it just exacerbated the problem?  If I don't get any other
    suggestions I am planning on changing the driver's side trailing
    arm back to the original to see if that changes the camber.  I
    would prefer not to do that so please suggest away.

    Also, does anyone know how to check camber?  I think yoy put a
    level on the wheel and measure the distance it is away from
    perpindicular and covert inches to degrees- is this reasonably
    accurate- if so what is the conversion rate?  What should I be
    getting for camber readings?  What is optimal for track, street,
    etc.

You can confirm if it's heat soak by getting the car hot (as you 
describe), then let sit with the hood open for 45-60 minutes, and 
restarting.  If the cooler engine starts fine, then you've likely got 
an engine-compartment heat problem that vaporizes the gasoline in the 
fuel line.

It's strange that the car has always done this - sound like there's 
still something wrong in your 931 vs. other 931's.  Have you examined 
all the fuel lines (bent, crushed, etc.)?  Check for missing insulation 
on fuel lines, or incorrect cooling of turbo or radiators.  Many older 
cars get hacked by unknowing owners, and important ducting is removed.  
Just some thoughts...

Definately a possibility of a bent trailing arm. Even a small warpage
can account for several degrees of camber/toe.  Make sure the car is
settled by driving around for a few miles. I had a similar problem
which was completely cured with a fresh steel trailing arm.

       accurate- if so what is the conversion rate?  What should I be

I would suggest starting out with -1 degree camber and -.5 degree toe.
Then you can begin to tweak these settings. I assume you are running
6x15 wheels. Toe will probably have a more profound effect on your
perception on the car's "handling".

Pam,

I have been taking my '83 944 to San Carlos German Motor Works on the
El Camino at Holly Street in San Carlos (of course).  I have never had
a bad, or even questionable, business relationship with them.  They 
have done oil changes to clutch and throw-out bearing jobs for me and
I've never had to take anything back for an adjustment.  Price was always
fair for the job done.  They also did a head upgrade job on my '76
BMW 530i several years ago for what I thought was a reasonable price.
I put an additional ~70,000 miles on that car before trading it in on
my 944 and it was still a strong performer.

I have tried a couple of other Porsche shops on the peninsula between
San Carlos and Sunnyvale but was not really happy with them.

Best of luck on the fuel leak.

I assume from his questions that he is having a problem with over heating,
or higher than normal temperture readings.  The impeller is pressed on to
the pully shaft.  If it starts slipping, it is possible for the seals and
bearings to check out OK, but still not be OK!  No way to verify that this

Subject: 914 rebody


Kyle,

I suppose the limits of resoration are up to you, it might be more
cost effective to dip the car in a stripper like Harvey Smith use
to do to the 356s. It's a matter of worth to the owner.

As for gas welding versus tig, mig and inert gas, well, on the poor 
quality metal (mild steel) Karmann used for 356 911 and 914 panels it
doesn't matter. There will be more hardness with tig or mig in the 
welded are, but I suspect that Von Nolting is employing an assembly
method similar to the original at the factory, plain gas welding allows
for working a little to blend into existing panels. By the way, most
Porsche models are welded with an electro-gas robot these days at the 
factory.

If you have a 914 that was rusty and you're repairing it, stick with
complete panel replacement. More expensive but stronger. I retired 
my 914/6 in 1981, repaired all the panels ( both rockers, frame member
under the battery and jack pockets) qand the present owner time trials
the car with not apparent problems. That car had the 914/6 GT stiffener
kit installed early on, seemed to be the right thing to do.

A little story about the trailing arms, if you time trial or race, 914
(all) will bend the trailing arms. Race rubber will do it very quickly,
so do it early. I bent a right rear arm at Laguna Seca years ago, I 
couldn't  understand why I was going faster until I realized that the 
right rear had 3 1/2 degrees of negative camber. 

One other thing to you low-rider 914 fans, teh rear train arms don't 
have a lot of travel up-ward. The arm will hit on the engine compartment
sheetmetal and bend when it makes contact under hard cornering. Besides,
the cars handle and ride like buck-boards. Bends shocks, too.

As long as your welds were even and consistant to good metal, you should
have no problems. Just remember to note  where the factory welded. I 
diped my 914 so I could get to the welded seams and see what Karmann 
did, I wound up miging all the seams as they did not do a good job. Or
maybe they did, realizing how poor the mild steel was. Just doing that 
made the  race car structure very strong.

	"door opening". This is on an '87 911 Carrera.

	The first assumption that I made,"It must be one of the expensive
	control boxes" proved false.

	The assumption the dealer made "You have removed the buzzer that
	sounds when the key is left in the ignition, what do you expect?"
	Obviously false!

	The assumption sugested by several P-philes, "The jerk who installed
	the burgular alarm screwed up the wiring" although most likely,
	proved false!

	So you ask, "What was the problem, John?"

	Well, .... long pause. Scene moves to Stutgardt.

	Wilhem the welder, welded the ground lug on the passenger side 
	interior roof connection in the wrong position, shorting the 
	switch/sense ground on the lamp housing to the chassis ground.

	Leonardo the lamp installer, found the short, and called Igor the
	inspector who agreed that there was a problem, summoned Tino the 
	tape installer over, who applied a length of black fabric tape over
	the offending connection, and voila everthing worked,...for five years.

	So,.... The Factory screwed it up.

	Anyway, all is fixed with a couple if well placed pieces of heat-shrink

Hmmm, so I guess that means that my '66 911S is a luxury car?  It has a wood
dashboard too.  Actually only the 3 inch section where the steering column,
key, light switch, etc fit is wood.  Around the guages the dash is metal.

 | Lately the Sunroof on my 85/2 944 has decided to function at its own will.

I was the original poster and wanted to thank to all those who
responded. I just wanted to follow-up and let the folks know my
solution. 

Well the problem with my sunroof was not the micro switch but the
triangular plate on the sunroof that activates the switch. The plate
was very lose and hence was unable to depress the micro-switch properly.
All I did was to remove the three rubber caps (these rubber caps are
located in the inside middle and the front of sunroof) and tightened the
screws behind it.

Now my new problem is that when the ignition key is in the 1st position
(first click where electrical items are activated), the arm does
not retract away from the panel and I cannot get the roof to detach.
I haven't checked the switches in the back yet (next weekend task) and
just wanted to get the group wisdom beforehand. Is there any other way
to detach the sunroof.

For you spotted owl freaks:

MG Mitten and JC Whitney offered aftermarket wood panel dash 
enhancements (enchanments?) for a variety of cars, the 914 being one of
them. They sold a lot, judging from what I've seen in Porsches I've
judged at concours over the years. There was a choice of oak, mahagony,
teak and monkey wood. They left a little in fit and finish quality.

It is a certainty that any you find in any Porsche are aftermarket. It 
is one option the factory SHOULD have offered in the 914.

Subject: RE: SOS 944 Bay Area mechanic needed


Though I now live in Seattle, I bought my '74 911 from my parents,
who still live in San Carlos.  When they told me they'd had the engine
rebuilt at San Carlos German Motor Works, I figured they'd probably
chosen the shop by driving down El Camino until they found a shop
with "German" in the name.  So, I called up Bruce Anderson, (PCA
Nat'l Tech Chairman) who lives in Sunnyvale and asked him what he
knew about the shop's reputation.  He said that if he were to choose
any shop on the peninsula (maybe he said Bay Area) that would be
the one.

Now that I've had the car for a few years, I'm not sure I'd agree.
There's two things I have a complaint with.

One:   2.7 911 engines are notorious for the studs pulling, and though
they replaced the stock studs with what appear to be Dilavar studs,
they didn't use Time serts, so now the really expensive Dilavar studs
are pulling out of the really cheap stock serts.

Two:  the second-most notorious flaw in a 2.7 engine is chain tensioner
failure.  When I called them up and asked them why they didn't replace
the stock tensioners with the Carrera tensioners, they said they didn't
believe that the tensioners were really the true root of the problem, that
the ramps (I think) were really the cause of tensioner failure and they'd
used the new, better ones.  OK, so 5,000 miles after the rebuild, why did
my left timing chain go from sounding perfectly normal to sounding like
my garbage disposal does when there's a spoon stuck in it, in the space
of about 5 minutes?  Since it also happened about 100 miles from home,
on grid for an autocross that I couldn't afford to lose the points for, I 
was
doubly ticked off.

Though I know there are flocks of people out there who can attest to their
2.7 running for 100K miles without either of these updates, my personal
opinion is that a competent shop would do them as a matter of course
during a rebuild.  Wish I could recommend an alternative shop . . .

In one of your messages to me you mentioned some amazing 912 engine failures
due to people driving their 912's like they were 911's.

Can you tell me what some of the more common failures were and how to avoid
them?  I've read that broken crankshafts were a common failure, but find it 
difficult to believe.  I've seen 912 crankshafts and they make VW cranks
look like toys in comparison.  

Also, I've noticed some oil accumulating on the sheet metal directly under
the main pulley.  Is this a common leak point on 912's?  If not, what is the
fix?

John,

I used to own a '77 911S with factory "temperature diverter valve" and
lines to the front fender well. Instead of the "trombone" cooling coils, I
had installed a radiator-type cooler from Alan Johnson Racing. All by
itself, it may not have been better than just a trombone. The problem is
getting air through the cooler. Depending on the type of cooler you
installed, you might have the same problem. Since most of my stressful
driving was at speed around race tracks, all I needed to do was remove the
front right turn signal and box-in the cooler with sheet metal to make sure
all the air coming through the turn signal was going through the cooler
(just removing the turn signal was not enough!). This had a dramatic result
and all my heat problems went away. If your problems are in stop and go
traffic (or you really need your turn signal) then you might note that '84
and later Carreras (I'm pretty sure) had a thermostatically controlled fan
that blew air through the radiator-type cooler in their front fender well.
I'm sure, though, that any of these Carrera pieces are very expensive...

Hope this helps.

Actually, believe it or not, the factory thought that the S was a luxury

John--

I have a similar set-up to what you've described: live in Tucson,
black-on-black '77 911S, A/C & EGR & smog pump removed, 11 bladed fan.  I
did a full engine rebuild 13,000 mi ago and haven't had any problems with
running hot since on either freeway or around town driving.  

Normal temp has been ~190; the only time I've seen the temp even get near
210 degrees was idling for 15 minutes in line for a smog check on a warm
day.  I credit this to the front fender oil cooler (Terbatrol, I think,
installed by previous owner, so I couldn't tell you how hot it ran before).
 Anyway, thanks to that cooler, it is possible to have the 2.7l cool in AZ.
 

You've probably already gotten rid of your engine-searing thermal reactors?

I like your idea of the more reasonably priced VW oil coolers!  (BTW, my VW
Squareback doesn't have cooling problems for the simple reason that I don't
have any gauges on it to tell me how hot it's running...)

I believe it's usually gradual, although a catastrophic failure may be
possible.  In either case, the symptoms may be more subtle, in that the
car's coolant (temp gauge in dash) will tend to run hotter, for example,
when stuck in traffic.

Btw, there _is_ an Interstate (or Sears, or whatever) battery which

Side-to-side play, ie, along the axis of the half-shaft, is just fine

A friend of mine had a 66 911 with a wooden dash, which I had been led
to believe was from the factory. Does your comment about "any Porsche"
include the early 911?

This switch is quite simple. Just pry it off with a thin steel  
plate/knife so that the edges do not crack, disconnect the three  
wires and pull it apart. There is a little spring which you don't  
want to jump on your face so be careful. Luckily it isn't that stiff.  
After removing that you see the contacts under the rocker. Since the  
switch is open these tend to attract dust which is the likely cause  
of your problem.

 Hi Steve,

 The most common 912 engine failures, as far as I know, are broken
 crankshafts, cracked cylinder heads and broken rods. If you'd like
 to see some *IMPRESSIVE* photographs, buy Harry Pellow's books
 (at least "The ABC's (and 912's) of Porsche Engines" and "Secrets of
 the Inner Circle"), they are worth the money.

 Leakage at the main pulley is very common and due to a worn pulley
 seal. The seal can be changed without pulling the engine.

 Regarding your spark plug problem: the cylinder heads have helicoil
 inserts. Therefore, I think the threads cannot be stripped all that
 easily.

 Best regards,

 Wulf

You see, when all the electrical parts in the car see the "Porsche" 
logo on the battery, they draw much less current from the battery !  
So I've been told by a Porsche dealer parts rep.

No, but seriously, any good quality battery should do, unless the
Porsche battery has some modified specs not found in other batteries.
I don't know if that's true for a 911 Porsche battery, although I would
doubt it.
I replaced my 944 Porsche battery (last year after 5 years of service) 
with an Interstate battery with a higher Amp-Hour rating. So far so good.

Morning All,

One of the fans in the fan assembly of my '83 944 has quit working,
stunk to high heaven when I parked it yesterday.  I looked up, in
Automotion's catalog 11, for a replacement and pictured on page 123
is a single fan (with motor hidden behind a four bladed fan?) and 
a price listed as $229.95!  My question: is this the price of just
one fan motor and blade, or, is this the price of the whole assy.
which consists of two fan motors with blades mounted in a frame for
mounting in the car?  If this is the price of the whole assembly,
can just one fan be purchased and replace just the bad one?

I'll give them, and a few other parts houses here in the bay area,
a call later (Retail places aren't open at this ungodly hour).

Thanks for any info.

Subject: New 911 - triumph of development over design


More things coming out in the motoring press from Porsche
about the new 911. The beast is on show in September at
Frankfurt Motor Show, and lucky Germans can expect deliveries
to start in October. Shipping is due to start in the UK in
early 94 and some time after that the new 911 will be available
in the US.

Currently Porsche are manufacturing 60 911, 30 968 and *3*
928 per day. The firm is in a critical position with German 911
sales (the major market) down by 50% from a year ago. The company 
hopes that the new 911 will turn around the business in
domestic and foreign markets.

The new 911 looks even cleaner in body style than the existing
Carrera 2/4, the glass is all flush or semi flush, the front and
rear bumpers now look like proper body panels rather than retrofits. The
front headlights are steeply raked a la 968, and  make the front
look pretty radical in 911 terms. The standard body now is slightly
wider as the arches have to contain even wider wheels and track than 
the current C2/4. The only things that have not been reworked are 
the doors from what I can see in the pics.

Suspension is double alumininium wishbones at the rear, with modified
Macpherson (sp?) struts at the front. Brakes are Bosch ABS 5 and wheels
are 16 inch with a 17 inch option.

Engine HP is up to ~270 through a close ratio box
with six gears. Initially coupe only, shortly followed by turbo and
cab. versions. The Turbo has a wacking 400HP!

According to the article that I cribbed all this from (Autocar 28 
July 1993), there will be no more Targa versions, just when the 
1970s are back in fashion as well!

I know about half a dozen people racing 356s and I believe each of
them has broken at least one crank.  These cranks are magnafluxed
every year and do not exceed 7500 rpm.  One of them broke right
between the words mag and OK from the last magnaflux.  These are

Many batteries (for American cars) have smooth feet, and are mounted

I've had good luck at Sears for my 951, which has a slightly different

Porsche factory batteries are more expensive and have less capacity

Frank,

Yes, it does include very early 911s. Volkswagen dealers (they usually
dealt in Porsches in those days) tended to fancy up the foot traffic
attraction that the 911 was for them. The wood dash was usually done
to remove the stigma of "plain Porsche plastic", a term the late, great
Henry Manney III wrote when he described the unveiling of the 901 (as
it was originally called) at the Frankfort Auto Show.

Henry Manney was a roving columnist for Road and Track for many years,

Ditto other's comments, if you've adjusted for max camber and you're only
getting ~1 degree, your trailing arm is bent (IMO).  Get it on an alignment
rack at a reputable performance shop (best if familiar with 911's).  I had to

Opposite is true.  Lowering will give you MORE camber.  Raising will
cause decamber.  Your passenger side sounds pretty good (you may be too low if
you're getting ~3 degrees). Remember you have to have some suspension travel
or you'll have no control in bumps (to say nothing of streetability)..

I use a camber gauge on a perfectly level garage floor.  The gauge is basically
a bubble type level indicator, so the surface the car is on has to be near
perfect.  I level check the surface 3 ways (forward/back, side/side and cross)
this becomes more critical for weight balance.  Also agree with earlier poster
on rolling the car after changing to settle suspension.  If you drive over
bumps just before parking on your level surface, bounce each corner by hand
3-4 times.

On a different subject but in the same magazine, 3 cars that were drastically

There was a 300zx putting out 450HP, a Mazda RX7 with 17" wheels and added 
boost, and I think a Mitsubishi 3000 pumped up too.  Here is the question:

Why did all the modified cars, when compared to the factory stock cars,

A number of the aftermarket places, like Performance Products, will sell
you this tool for big bucks.  I bought one a bunch of years ago, silly me,
when they went for only sorta-big-bucks.  I recently donated it to my

Rather than shelling out, I would recommend either using a hammer,

The problem here is that most of these mags don't have adequately
qualified drivers to test these cars.  It's only when they hire someone
like Danny Sullivan or that caliber to do a comparison test that they get
worthwhile results.  Witness the test last year when Danny drove the 911
Turbo, Vette, 300ZX, NSX, Miata, MR2, et. al. - guess which one was
fastest on the road course and judged the best "race" car by Danny!  When
driven properly, I'm positive the 911 Turbo would leave the Supra Turbo in
the dust...  Same applies to the test of the modified riceburners... gotta
have real drivers, not writers, testing those cars or the results could be
anything.

Why should they have to hire somebody "special" to drive the cars? Surely the
best test is a driver with good ability - and not necessarily the best (who we know
can extract the best from a temperamental (flawed?) car). 

911's handling have been criticised from the beginning and even though this has 
been mostly corrected (recently) they are still a harder car to drive fast than
some of the recent japanese (and other) competition.

I am not sure that there is a competition, it's a no contest I suspect.
I can never understand where this `911 handling is bad' idea comes from.
I think that the record of the 911, which I suggest has more significant
motorsport victories than all other marques put together, indicates 
otherwise.

I would support the notion that the 911 design leaves a low margin
for driver error though. The margin is pushed right out to the extreme
edge of the performance envelope, which may be what gives the 911 the edge.
You really can take the 911 to the brink, at which point you can turn back
or go over if you have not spotted where you are. The 911 allows you
to put more in and get more out.

And then the asthetics: the howl of the redlining flat six, the roaring
of the air cooling, the squat of the rear as you nail the throttle and 
then the eyeball sucking deceleration as you stamp on the brakes scrubbing 
100MPH is scant seconds, the stench of the red hot brakes, the gforce and 
the sense of a massive pendulum effect swinging you through the bend,
and then nail the gas again and pure traction claws you through. Ah, the 
joy of the 911! Of course get this wrong and enjoy countryside scenic
views while travelling backwards very fast though fields and hedges.

Subject: 911 Camber

    Kevin,

    In response to your question, no I did not replace my spring
    plates with Sway-away (I assume those are the "adjustable
    aftermarket spring plates?).  Do you think that my spring
    plates might be the problem?  I have thought about swapping spring
    plates from side to side to see if this would change my camber
    readings.

    Yesterday (and the day before) I changed out my driver's side
    trailing arm for my original one.  I now have a little more
    negative camber (at least the tire is not rubbing on the fender
    lip), but not as mucj as I have on the passenger's side (yes, I
    did try adjusting the eccentric).  I realized that I lowered the
    car a little too much (by about an inch), so I will be raising it
    again and I assume that it will take away some of my new-found
    negative camber.

    BTW, changing out a trailing arm on a 1971 is a *@#%^$ of a job!
    Apparently on the earlier and later cars it is simpler but on
    some cars the factory manual says you have to drop the
    engine/trans to back out the bolt (there is not enough clearance
    between the bolt head and the case of the transmission to remove
    the bolt completely from the end of the arm).  I "simply"
    disconnected the mounting bolts and the trans and engine and
    wiggled the whole unit around until I had enough (barely, I might
    add) room to get the bolt out.

    As always, any comments/suggestions are welcomed.

Well, Lotus seem to have always sorted there handling out without needing
20+ years of "development"!

I didn't say it was "bad" as such, I said it has always been criticised. The 
911's handling is good in that traction is good and high g cornering has
always been the norm but is bad in that for quite a number of years they
were considered overly light at the front end (then again the steering
and its balance has always been praised so you can't have it both ways)
and the rear suspension was always a weak point in that it responded violently
to, what must be said, are natural reactions in certain situations, eg in an
understeer situation sharp throttle unloading would cause the back to jump 
out which on wet roads caused many accidents. Now you might say that you 
shouldn't do this anyway - but why should you put up with it when cars are 
available which don't exhibit such "features"


> I think that the record of the 911, which I suggest has more significant
> motorsport victories than all other marques put together, indicates

Like i've already said in a previous article - consumer cars should be judged
with "consumer type people" and not experts. I would also contend that 
the 911's many many victories were in spite of the handling and not because
of it. The victories seem to be in two areas - 1) rallying (in the early years 65-69)
 - which were due to the durability of the car and a power to weight ratio (don't
forget their main competition at the time was 1300cc Mini's! and 2) the
track years(74-80) which, like a lot of Porsches victories, seem to be based upon
a superiority in turbocharger technology - not to take credit away from Porsche
for the 911 but I think it's more a case of development and not original design.

> I would support the notion that the 911 design leaves a low margin

Agreed.

> And then the asthetics: the howl of the redlining flat six, the roaring
> of the air cooling, the squat of the rear as you nail the throttle

Yes, that's why i've still got mine - damn unpractical (anybody know
a kiddie seat (9m-4yrs) for the rear of a 911 that's obtainable in Europe!) and
to drive the thing more than just occasionally drives me nuts (bloody
uncomfortable) but for that short period a week it's worth it (I think!)


> then the eyeball sucking deceleration as you stamp on the brakes scrubbing

Well, mine worry me sometimes - I find the fronts lock a little too easily, mind
you they are twenty years old and they must have been wonderful in 1973!

Public apology due:  I had my cambers and decambers and my negatives and
positives intermixed in my comments on Steven's 911 questions.  The clan I
hang with don't use proper terminology much -- since positive camber is
verboten, we talk in more absolute terms; camber becomes negative more
camber is more negative, etc.  Thus my decamber statement meant "to have
less negative camber".  You're all suitably confused by now...

Bottom line: As you lower a 911, you get more negative on the camber.

Sorry for any other confusion....

Carl DeSousa asked about road tests,

Well, the modified cars were probably done by some fellows who have 
their own ideas of how to abuse a already compromised design. Face
the facts, most people that own Porsches put on comprimises in tires
and wheels to suit their taste and wallet. Not a bad thing but:

Many pieces for suspensions that are marketed don't work. Most just 
waste your time and money, some really do work, but they require a
substancial investment  and don't add to ride or comfort and are a 
bitch to  drive on the street. 
 A car that can do 1G on the skidpad may not have good off-throttle 
transient response (spell that squirrelly) which will make you go slower
in the slalom. The key to the whole thing is to learn how good you are
behind the wheel and set your car up accordingly, fact is, most of the
cars are far better than the drivers so they should stay in Hondas and 
the right lane.

As I have just written, adding cubic money to your Porsche doesn't make
it go faster. Some of the worst-handling pigs I have ever driven have
been owner-modified Porsches( and Corvettes). One comment I will make 
is that most of those people were well-meaning and got pooned by a less than honest shop making big-bucks on the margins for some of that junk.
It was frustrating telling an owner that one of the reasons he couldn't
get the car to handle was that stuff.

I read that road test, by the way. The 911 is hard to drive because the weight bias and the training most motor vehicle operators have makes
the tactil feel of the 911 appear foreign to their senses. A Driver
(there is a difference between the term `driver' and `operator') will 
have the background to adjust to the environment. Operators tend to
back off and complain if anything is different than their limited range
of feel and responses.

99% of all road test people are operators. Sorry Csare Csabe, you are
an operator. Bedard is only one rung above you. The magazines take 
advertising so they are biased when a manufacturere leans on them 
dangling a big ad contract. The other outfit that takes pride in not 
having advertising doesn't know how to test cars and willingly parrots
information about reliability without questioning the source's sample
database. 

So who to believe? The Fantacides or the ccommunists? Try something 
yourself, you have to live with it. 

So much for my rumblings this morning.

I believe the problem is the conceptual idea behind what a car magazine 
should be.  Aren't they supposed to bring us news, tests, information, etc. 
about cars?  ALL cars?  Now leaf through your last ten issues of R&T or C&D 
(et. al.) 80% testing on sports and performance cars and 20% everyday driver 
type cars.  When's the last time they tested a Sentra or a Ford Escort?  
Because the reader's want it, the mags will test the Porsches, Vettes, 
Ferraris, Jap Turbo cars and even Lamborghinis in every single issue.  So, 
we see four "tests" a year of the 911 Turbo each of which says something 
about how hard it is to drive the car fast.
Now look at the typical 911 Turbo buyers:
     a.  people with too much money who want to LOOK good
     b.  people with too much money who love to DRIVE fast
The folks in group a. could care less how the car handles or if the Supra is 
faster or easier to drive.  The others enjoy the challenge of driving one of 
the worlds fastest production cars and could care less if they COULD 
theoretically stomp on the brakes in the middle of a hard turn without losing 
control.  I'm sure there'll be a few stragglers, but what it really boils down to 
is that the writer's in the mags that "test" the cars don't drive the cars for 
the people who ultimately buy them.  They emphasize performance in their 
tests - because that's what the reader's want to see - but they're really not 
qualified enough to JUDGE performance (there are exceptions of course).  So 
why don't the mags hire people who are qualified to JUDGE performance?
A good example was a test done a few years ago where a whole bunch of 
big name magazine writer's drove a Vette on a skidpad.  The resulting 
numbers ranged from somewhere around .88 to .92 I believe.  Then 
someone like A.J. Foyt or Sullivan or the like got in the car - he did .97 or .98 
under identical conditions.  Point is - the numbers you see don't mean much 
and the information that's printed ultimately boils down to the opinion of the 
writer and their (limited?) ability to extract the highest performance out of 
the car.

'nuff said - IMHO of course...

This should be close to that of the 914 setup.  Something that I've done
when the ball joint won't come out of the strut is support the front on
jackstands (shake the car to make sure it's secure) and put a floor jack
under the brake rotor and push the strut up off the ball joint.

As for the threaded ring that holds the ball joint into the a-arm, first
pull the pin and the keeper plate (round with fingers all around the edge)
and then i use a spanner wrench to unthread the ring.  Remember to be
sure the notch for in the ball joint is possitioned correctly in the 
a-arm so it locks in properly.  

Assembly is reverse of disassembly (sort of).

Car and Driver in their test of the '86 Porsche 930 said something like
(approx. quote)
	It takes a good driver to drive the car to its limits.
	None of our staff was qualified.
That seems unusually modest and accurate for car magazines.  Part of
the problem appears to be that writers aren`t aware of their limits.


The 911 turbo won in 1991 and 1992 in Showroom Stock IMSA Supercar
class, In 1992 they were running with 190 lbs handicap.  Those on the
list who know better, please correct or comment on how this relates to
the cars we buy.  The 930 was introduced in 1976 for homologation for
the 935 and 934; the 935 was extremely successful; it was quite
similar to the 930.

I am interested in knowing the performance limits of a car that I
might buy (or might not but that interests me).  I would rather have
the evaluation of a world class driver than a journalist.

I am also interested in knowing how an interesting car is to drive
for an average driver like me without getting enough track time 
(hard to get these days) and instruction.

As an unqualified observer, it seems to me as though Porsche's extreme
success was based on their early success with engines and
turbocharging.  I doubt that 37-63 weight balance helped their
performance.  Perhaps they would have been even better if they had
gone to mid-engine cars in the mid 70s.  According to Porsche's
engineer in charge of engines, they are reaching the limits of
air-cooled engines.

"Alas, poor Yorrick, he was cambered well!"

Camber and de-camber. Adding camber is cambering, removing is de-
cambering.

zero camber is dead-nuts straight up in the alignment scenario, adding
to either plane is adding camber, removal from either plane is 
decambering. 

The mis-use of this term comes from the universal ignornce that grew up
around the beetle and the desire to remove the dreaded oversteer from it
and the 356 in the *old* days. Most of the ignorant poops didn't realize
that that made matters worse and the proper way to get things under 
control was to shorten the hoop and relocate the trans mount up 1 1/2"
and add 1 1/4 degree negative camber to the rear. This little piece of 
work relocated the mass and lowered the car without destroying the ride and making the rear tires look like the axles were bent. This was the 
real trick among men to make the 356 work.  In the front one needed to 
machine the front links to reduce the positive camber to 1/2 degree 
negative and negative camber gain. They were sporting but very evil 
handling any other way, the competition, fortunately, was much worse.

Old Harry Weber used to do this in the fifties and Timenaus never caught
the ruse. I did it to my street 356B coupe and would never go back to a 
stock setup. This isn't a modification for an amateur, however.

Subject: gas leak in '77 924, Part II

Hi all-

Thanks to all for the helpful suggestions in fixing my gas leak.  I tried
a quick fix, of putting some silicone around the gas tank sending unit,
and I thought I solved the problem.  Unfortunately, when filling up today,
I got the gas smell again.  Luckily, I was able to catch the 'gremlin' in
the act!  I popped off the plastic cover that protects the tank sending
unit, and saw a bit of a wet spot slightly in front of the fuel tank sending
unit.  I'm thinking it could be one of two things; a) the fuel tank sending
unit's gasket, an easy fix, or b) a bad connection from one of the vent
hoses or fill hoses, one of which leads aft to a point somewhere near that
sending unit.   I will get the gasket and try that first.  But
if I have to get access to the hoses, things look rough; when I pulled the
plastic cover from the fill hose/vent hose area, I saw trouble.  It seems

Subject:  more on DELLORTO carbs (really carbs in general)

Gutentag all!

A couple of people recommended that I purchase "The Dellorto Superformance
Tech Book" as an aid in setting up my carbs installed on a 912 w/NPR kit.

Well I bought it and it is very good.  I highly recommend it for anyone with
Dellorto's or Weber's or any carbs for that matter.  Anyway, I currently have
a set of 36mm's installed and am looking for more top end acceleration.

After reading this guide, I believe I know why my 1600lb Speedster replica
is so slow.  First, 40mm's may have been a better choice.  But the 36's were
on the engine when I purchased the car and they
are like new, so too bad.  The existing carbs are setup from CB Performance
as follows:
                       Venturi-30
          	       Main/Air- 180
                       Main/Gas- 122
                       Idle Gas-  55
                       Acc/Pump-  50

There is a graph on p. 56 of this guide that compares Main Venturi Diameter
with Single Cylinder Capacity.  The results will vary according to the 
rpm redline of your engine.  Using the 6,000 rpm max line and .430 for the
SCC, I should be using 34mm Venturis.  The guide states to "Put in larger
venturies to go fast, stay with smaller or mid-size venturies for improved 
everyday driving.

Then there is the 4.0 Rule.  To select the proper size Main/Gas jet, multiply
the 34mm venturi by 4. (34mm Venturis x 4 = 136 Main/Gas) So go a bit to the
richer side and you end up with 140 Main/Gas.

From what I've read the Idle, Main/Air and Acc/Pump should be okay at their 
present sizes.

I'll let everyone know how great an effect this will have on the top end
acceleration.  Let me know what you think.  Is this a waste of time?

I've have driven my girlfriend's Miata.  I know what you mean by AMAZING.
Porsche definitely must study the Miata shifter for the Boxter.  It's got
to be at the top of the list as far as shifters go.  All Mazda has to do
is put more power under the hood and the Miata will be an even better 
convertible for the money than it already is.  

Let me know if you are planning to look at aftermarket parts for the Miata

Folks-

Sean Namazi <sharam@ole.cdac.com> asks ...

>>> Did porsche make any non-sunroof coupes in 83? <<<

They made at least one; one of my co-workers had one.

He bought it _cheap_, too, because of that.

It seems that someone had ordered an SC, with a sunroof, navy leather,
etc., and wanted it painted Mercedes white to match his wife's car.

So the dealer puts in a special order, Porsche whangs out a shell, gets
some paint from the guys across town (or maybe trucked the shell over
there, I dunno), builds the car, sends it to the dealer, and the
salesman calls to owner to pick it up.

Owner shows up with his wife in the white Benz, takes a look at the SC,
and says "Where's the sunroof?"

Salesman blanches whiter than the Merc, checks the order, checks the
build sheet, and sits down.  The order says "sunroof" but the build
sheet doesn't.

Owner says "Call me when _my_ car comes in," and drives off.

The car did demo duty for a couple of months, then my friend bought it.

Water in the taillamp assembly is pretty typical after a repair, because

Experts I've conferred with tell me that it's a common mistake to use engine
redline for sizing venturis/jets/etc.  You should use max HP rpm instead.
You'll perhaps lose some top end HP, but the torque/HP curve will be flatter
and stronger overall, resulting in a faster car...

1984 Carrera Targa, Platinum Metallic exterior, Mocha Brown interior.  Car is
equipped with the following FACTORY options:

Color Matched Alloys
Full Leather Interior
Sport Seats
Headlight Washers
Sport Suspension
Limited Slip Differential
A/C
Alarm
Short Shift Lever
(Power Windows, antenna, mirrors and cruise control, etc. were standard equip.)

In addition, '86 Carrera sway bars were added, additional alarm system,
bra/cover, suspension lowered/aligned/balanced by 911 guru Dwight Mitchell,
H4 headlights, deep pile mats and sheepskin seat covers.

Car is in excellent condition with 67K miles on it.  We are the 2nd owners
and have all the maintenance records.  Clutch was replaced at 50K, Alternator
at 64K, brakes at 50K.  Mobil 1 oil changes every 5K.  First 64K miles were in
California.

The car has been autocrossed about 15 times in the past two years but never
has seen a high speed event.  Original owner bought it "because she liked the
color" and never drove it hard either.  It took me over 9 months to find this
car when I was looking, and will not be a disappointment to prospective buyers.

Were looking for $21.5K (USD).

Just a couple of quick questions (hastily compiled to save bandwidth):

1)JWhen driving 60-80 mph, there are 1 or 2 little zones (63-65 mph is one)
where the steering wheel gets a jiggle.  A few friends indicate this can be
corrected by balancing and/or rotating the tires.  True/part true/ false?

2) When driving at low speeds, occasionally (esp. on hot days)Jthe
speedometer needle will wobble. This problem has not been seen over 50
mph.  Would the logical starting place to test be the speedometer unit in the
dash, or the connections on the other end?

3)  Just a shot in the dark, but... My 944 came with custom floor mats from
the previous owner.  There are two brown front mats which read:  DWM.
Any DWMUs out there want a good deal on floor mats?  Or, as a gift:

Tell your friend that the life expectancy of the early 944 is 143,480
miles before it disintegrates. So if he gets it *right now* then
it can be driven for 30,000 miles and sold with absolutely no
problems, with several thousand miles to spare. 

Seriously:
I think what you're really asking is "Assuming proper maintenance and
moderate duty useage, what is the average interval for bottom end
overhaul for the early 8V 944 motor?" I would put that in the ballpark
of 150,000 to 170,000 miles based on the few overhauls I have
witnessed. This takes into account cylinder liner wear.

What year is the car?  Very early ones (82/83) had this problem, and it 
was very hard to get rid of.  Your friends are basically correct, but 
you also need to check your alignment (esp. toe-in/out) and if your 
wheels are true (not bent).

A little wobbling is normal, due to the speedo mechanism's design.  
It's worst at low speeds.  Can't say for sure without seeing yours.  
85/2 cars have electronic speedo's so this characteristic is gone.  
Replacing the [old] cable *might* help.

Sounds like the throwout bearing.  If the noise persists in neutral 
with clutch depressed, it's highly likely that the TO bearing is the 
culprit.  Pretty cheap part, but ~$1500US of labor to replace it!  
(it's a good idea to replace lots of stuff if the clutch area is opened!)

Hydraulics wouldn't do this - they just move the two discs apart, so as 
long as you're disengaging completely there would be no noise.

Subject: Fuel and ignition questions on 76 911s

Hi All

Two questions:

The car the questions apply to is a 1976 911s, 2.7l, point based CDI ignition
and CIS fuel injection.

1.  Ideas welcomed on why car stalls when coming to a stop with A/C on, 
    sometimes.   The car just drops off the idle speed and stalls.  The 
    following things have been checked.

	Idle speed is correctly set - 950 - 1000 RPM.
	CIS air flow plate is clean and adjusted for the correct height.

    I believe that the A/C is aftermarket but it looks like factory parts
    were used.  There is however no idle speed solenoid that would bump up
    the idle with the A/C on.  I am used to seeing this in other cars.  Its 
    better now that I cleaned and adjusted the air flow sensor, maybe I should 
    just run a higher idle speed?

2.  Now the more interesting of the two.  Driving along at steady state speeds
    the car will, very seldomly, have the ignition cut out for only the 
    briefest moment and then return.  I am fairly sure that it is ignition 
    as the tach drops of at the exact same time and it is driven off the 
    same feed as the ignition.  If it were fuel is should be a gradual decrease
    in the tach instead of a straight drop.  The following things have been
    checked.

	Point setting.
	All electrical connections - which are tight and clean

    This is a very seldom occurance but certainly annoying.  One strange thing
    was that there is a ground strap on the fender well just behind the

    Any Ideas where it goes?  I don't really think it has any relation to the
    problem however.

Now just a flight of technical fancy - 

The major problem with the CIS fuel injection is the air flow sensor.  In that
it is very subjectable to intake pulses that would cause the air flow sensor to
bounce and disturb the fuel flow.  So what do you think the possibility of
melding something like a hotwire sensor in its place and a control to accuate 
the metering body.  Remember that this is a technical possibility question and
not a real life issue, as it most likely would be A. mechanically difficult to 
find a controller that could react fast enough to operate the metering body. 
B. very difficult to get everything balenced without have a factory to back you
in research and C. Expensive.  But what the hell technical discussions can be
fun...

Thanks for your time.

   I am interested in the 944 lowering kit myself and wanted some
   comments on the merits and demerits of lowering the car. Also,
   is this task for the shade-tree mechanic with professional alignment
   or should the lowering task be left for the Guru shop.

I am a big fan of lowering, it is one factor that *directly* improves
the cornering of your car by lowering the C.G. and thus reducing
lateral weight transfer, no question about that. Reducing lateral
weight transfer makes each tire carry a more even distribution of
load. Lowering also [usually] accompaniess an increse in stiffness at each
axle which may reduce body roll and provide better suspension
geometry. I also like the way it looks on most cars. The bad points
usually involve scraping exhaust and spoilers when entering the
driveway or (much worse) bottoming out the suspension against the
stops which can be bad (causing essentially infinite roll stiffness)
if you haven't designed for it.

On the 944 you have to replace the springs in the front with the lower
variety, and in the rear, you have to replace/reset the torsion bars
just like on a 911. If you can change the front shocks you can lower
the front. The rear is a different story, quite a bit more involved, 
but possible to do under the proverbial shade tree given enough will 
and sweat.

An alignment is absolutely necessary afterwards. Corner balance optional.

PS: I am looking for a good used early ('84) 944 air conditioning
compressor. If you have one that you want to sell please email to me
ASAP (like today or tommorrow latest). Thankyou.

        Sounds like the TO bearing. On my 85/2 the pilot bearing is going,
and has been for 35k mi, but it only makes a "whirring" or kinda a
"gerrerering" midway upon release of the clutch, nothing once engaged or

I have to raise a flag here.  A lowered car induces bump steer and other 
suspension geometry problems.  Even after an alignment, tha angle of the
lower control arm is permanantly in the wrong position.  And when it travels,
up under compression, the angle gets worse.  This is explained in the book
"How to make your car handle".  This is part of the reason why a lot of
showroom stock cars put in faster times than lowered cars.  I think one
will feel perceived better handling because of less body roll and better
response.  I like lowered cars too.  My 911 is lowered, but even with
the steering rack raised to compensate, steering gets twitchy on bumpy roads.

btw, I'm amazed how far 944's can be lowered.

Steve,

A few comments on your planned experiment with the 34mm venturis.
I currently use Weber 40 IDF's on my 914 2.0.  I use the car as a daily 
driver as well and for the occasional autocross.  The carbs came with 
28mm venturis and was fairly quick up to about 4500 rpm.  I switched to 
32mm venturis which moved the power peak to about 5500 but gives me 
less power below 3000 rpm.  The point I am getting to is this.

You mentioned that with your current setup, your car was "slow".
If you meant that top speed was "slow" then bigger venturis may help.
However, your low end driveability will most likely suffer and make your car
less responsive in day to day driving.  It may also be slower at some
time-trial events where low end power is more critical than top end.

If you mean that your car does not accelerate quickly or seems low on
power even at low rpm, something else may be the problem.
(Carbs not synchronized, improper timing, worn cam etc...)

At some point, the ratio of the size of the venturi to the size of the
carb is important. (34mm in a 36mm may be pushing it)

Also, your cam plays a big part in determineing where your "peak" output rpm
is.
Doesn't it? 

Hope this helps.

You can lower the front of a 951S about 1/2" without affecting
suspension geometry by installing 225/45-16 tires instead of 
225/50-16's.  I made this change to my 951S and it subjectively improved
the steering response and cornering behavior of the car.
I suspect most of the change is due to stiffer sidewalls and better
tires (Dunlop SP8000's instead of D40/M2's), but the lower ride height
may help slightly.  Before the change, I had trouble with my car
understeering at the track; it has the small (16mm) rear stabilizer bar.

If you want to get really radical you can try 225/40-16's.

than mass air for calibration. several systems are avalible

Unfortunately (in terms of cost), your symptoms sound exactly like
those of a failed/failing throw-out bearing. Since the throw-out bearing
is concentric with the driveshaft, the repair process looks essentially
like that for the clutch itself. I can't see any way it could be the

Since the question of how long will a 944 last has been a topic of discussion
lately, does anyone have any data for longevity based on a Porsche dealer 
maintained car vs. an independent mechanic maintained car?

Seems that our 'trusty' Porsche dealers have been doing "authorized updates" 
to our car and these repairs aren't lasting.  (if we take the car back
2500 miles the dealer will consider re-doing one item) 

Things I really didn't want to know:  yes, you have to drop the transmission 
(gently) to get to the gas tank, but it only takes six hours.  Master 
cylinders are expensive.  Brake boosters are expensive.  The 'update' water

under a cover for, I guess, about 8 years :-(.  At first I was all fired

After much reading, what I think has to be done is, remove all running
gear, trim, etc. and have the body stripped down and the body repaired
and then part by part rebuild it.  I know I can tear it down, I sometimes
think I can put it back togather again, and in my worst moments of madness
(after reading the workshop manual) I beleave that with a little luck I can
rebuild the motor... maybe (As a student, years ago I did a main bearing job

My questions: Anyone care to toss out a ball park cost of the body work?
How do you find someone who can properly do the work, in the mid-west

there is surface rust on the bolt heads, etc.  What other major things

Interesting. I have a friend who has the same problem. Initially, I thought
it was the fact that he had a loose ground wire to his coil. But it wasn't
that easy... Theory now is a faulty Permatune unit, but we haven't

Well, now that you mention it.... I've had one of these in development 
since March or so. The theory is that since pulsed injection approximates
CIS at the limit of the cycle time, you win big time if you can recover
the relaxation time of the injector and still use a more sane air flow
metering scheme than stock CIS. Hence, flapper box or hot wire air flow
metering, fed into an electronically controlled fuel distributor.

Some comments: no, it's *NOT* easy. But, it's not been too expensive unless
you count my time at the rate my clients get billed for it.... If I'm
able to get it working, it should be a good alternative for *some* applications
but it may be too expensive (relative to Haltech, Electromotive, or 
CompTech -- about $6k for a 911, installed and running, for any of those
BTW...). Note that the Autothority hot wire kit for '84-90 Carreras 
is almost $2k and doesn't include any plumbing....

It has been two weeks sence I am the new owner of a 928s (1980).
The head gasket let go, blowing white vapor trails behind me.
I have been told that the 944's had some what of this type of problem.
Will I look forward for this to happen again? Or will this not happen again

RE:  Replacing the CIS air flow sensor (flapper plate)

	Not as fanciful a flight as you might think.  Most of the work has already 
been done by Autothority.  Their air mass flow sensor works by sensing the pressure
of the air passing through the chamber, and provides air mass data to the DME.

Your Task would be:

1.  Adapt pressure sensor to CIS airbox, calibrate for diameter of CIS air flow
sensor housing.

2.  Convert pressure sensor output signal to input signal for stepper motor
	(ie. build signal processor)

3.  Provide power supply for pressure sensor, signal processor, stepper motor

4.  link stepper motor to plunger in CIS fuel head.

	Obviously, the trick here is step 2.  The other 3 steps will take about
10% of the time invested in such a project.  The nice thing is that once done,
the whole assembly should fit in the CIS airbox, and could be a bolt-on upgrade.
If sold for under $1000, there would be a market.  Accompanied with the
appropriate mods to the fuel head venturis, this should be good for about +10% HP.

Well just to let you all know I have figured out what the problem was with the

Now time to put on my stupid hat:

My points were closing up.  I had installed new points about three months ago
and everything seemed fine, however I guess that I had not tightened them down
enough and they were starting to slip closed.  The gap was almost non-existant
when I checked them.  Gotta always remember to check those simple things first!

Well at least I now have everything together for the Aug 2 PCA drivers school

A couple of warnings/notices about mail currently circulating:

1.  A very common but very wrong fix for CIS idling problems is
disconnecting and plugging the decel valves.  Typically, the
decel valve does not fail, it just loses its calibration.  To
test it, remove it from the car.  Try to blow/breathe through
either of the large outlet tubes.  If you can, it's busted.
Now hook up your trusty brake bleeder, or other vacuum source,
to the small outlet tube at the top, and apply some vacuum.
Now you should breathe through the large tubes if its working
properly.  If it's working, it just needs adjustment.  This is
done by (no kidding) crushing it lengthwise.  Call your local
dealership, and ask him to dust off his tech bulletin archives.
I think it's about 1.5 mm.  Place a 19mm socket over the small
outlet tube to protect it.  Stick the whole thing in a vise 
lengthwise, and squeeze.  Measure the length before and after.

2.  FYI, Authority air mass flow sensors use a pressure sensor,
not a hot-wire sensor.

Subject: RE: Fuel and ignition questions


The subject of fuel injection systems has come up and I can attest from
personal experience that the Bosch CIS system is very reliable.
On my TR-6 (Sorry not a Porsche) race/road car I became fed up with
the dual carb set up and didn't want to go the Weber route.  So I designed
a fuel injection system for it.  Needless to say the car has turned into
a rolling laboratory.  If you plan on getting the car through emissions
you better know what you are getting yourself into.  If you are using
stock throttle bodies and injector locations you will probably be OK.
However, I decided to build my own throttle bodies and mess around
with injector locations.  The key word in any fuel delivery system is
MIXTURE.  If you are not getting the fuel to mix with the air you will
have rough idle problems poor performance and super high HC readings at
the tail pipe.
     If you are just modifying the control part of the FI system then
you are a little more out of the woods.  I decided to try and experiment
with a throttle position approach and discard a air mass/flow sensor.
This was to experiment on a new way to reduce the cost of an FI system
on non-catalytic cars.  The FI computer software uses "fuzzy logic"
(don't laugh its a serious control theory) based on throttle position,
ambient air temps, pressures, and engine RPM to set steady state fuel 
flow.  The neat thing is that it works!  I've logged about 3k mi this
summer on this system without even fouling a plug or burning a valve.
I was not able to put the engine on a dyno but I rented an engine
emission analyzer to fine tune the control logic.  It's a lot easier to
change fuel delivery schedules now with a lap top than it is to swap
needles or jets.  Any comments or questions....drop me a line.

Subject: Carbs, Venturis and Etc.

Steve:

Double check the graph in the book I've found it's very small and difficult to
work with unless you use a ruler to accurately lay in your variables. (I
found out the hard way!) As regards your desire for larger venturis the ans-
wer is totally dependent upon what you want the car to drive like.

Yes, the larger venturis will flow more air (constrained of course by the 
valves and porting on your heads) but at low RPM the vacuum signal is too
small to pull fuel into the carbs so you'll have to ramp up the idle RPM and,
at off idle the fuel will fallout of the fue/air stream leading to poor mid
range perf. At full throttle it will all smooth out.

Not having your engine in front of me I can speculate only about the following:

	Carb Synchronization
Part of your problems can b e the carbs are out of sync. If you balanced air
flow through them with the Unisyn as described in the book they are synced to 
pull equal amounts of air but they must open and close in sync or you'll run
one side of the engine ahead of the other. The book procedure is not good 
enough in the real world where things like heim joint drag and linkage fles
(oops - flex) come into play. There is a better way and if you're interested
let me know and I'll describe it for ya.

	Fuel PumP Pressure
Don't want to dwell on this but the overpressure caused by the electric pump
you've installed will cause continuous rich running and the engine will
never come on line and run correctly. Regardless of what you've been told
this is the single biggest problem you can have. I've had this problem on 
both air and H2o engines with webbers, dells, you name it. Before I got
smart on the Pantera I put on a Halon system to deal with carb fires that came
from the fuel pump overpressure. You live and occasionally learn! 

While you're at it check the tank outlet screen (depends on yor fuel tank), the
fuel line, fuel filter - any one of these can starve the engine at high RPM.
If the previous owner happened to use silicone sealers on any part of the fuel
system you've found a potential problem.

	Big Venturis
You mentioned that you would have to live with the venturis you currently had.
If I'm not mistaken you can replace the ones you have with a larger size. They
are real simple to exchange, a single nut/large dog point set screw assy loc
ates them in the carb body. They have to be replaced in the correct orientation
as shown in the book.

You might as well rebuild the carbs if you change venturis. The pump/accelera-
tor diaphram often goes south and the small passages in the well gum up. Again
be careful to get the float setting just right. You have to hold the upper
plate with the float sideways so that gravity doesn't compress the spring assy
in the needle valve.

Here's a final trick not recommended for daily drivers. Go up one or two sizes
on the idle jets and redadjust the idle. It won't idle as smoothly and the 
plugs will eventually load up but it will SCREAM off line and mid range. It
just won't stay in tune too long. Of course if you're only trying to out run
the Miata in a drag race that's all you need.

Although it is true that your lower sidewall will contribute to better
steering input reaction and reduced deflection under load, the compromise
is that as you go smaller overall diameter you reduce the length (area)
of your tire's contact patch.  This is why larger wheels are typically used
with short sidewall tires (one of the reasons, anyway).

If you are tracking the car, I'd suggest working with the suspension versus
reducing your tire footprint.

By the way, I had one die-hard competitor friend who maintained that the
correct suspension geometry was more a factor than lower center of gravity
in making quick laps.  He finally lowered his car (911), and his lap times
significantly came down as well.

Only if there are major rough sections in a track will I consider raising
the car.......

    I recently borrowed the Bentley book on Bosch FI.  It's a good source for
all kinds of info about general theory & even a little specific info.  The
author
(Probst) says that the MAF (hot-wire) puts out a voltage that is inverse to
the flapper-type.  Although I thout he said that the Flapper puts out a lesser
voltage for a greater displacement...  Could be wrong....
    Myself, I have wondered what it would be like to put a MAF on a 914 1.8L,
turning the L-jetronic into LH-jetronic.  The easy answer is: "not simple".
But it would appear that air mass is really what you want to sense, since the
air:fuel ratio is based on masses, and besides, the flapper takes longer to re-
spond and _can_ (but hasen't yet on mine) be warped by backfires.

Hi Guys,


So you want to play with fuel injection? Consider this, a better timed
system that has hot wire and the desired crank indexed sensing is made 
General Motors. The best one came on the GMC Scylone and can be mapped
to a 3.6 Porsche engine very easily. 

Here's the trick part, fabrication of the intake and tuning the runner
length. I'd say you'd need a 14 inch length on the intakes and a 35mm
bore on the tubes. the injectors should be place to spray on the back 
side of the intake valves, about 50mm away.

The stock mass air sensor and all of the computer sensors must be used,
this isn't a job for an amateur, but a pro could put a kit together.
Stan??? The computer would need a remap, but there are interfaces to
do PROM development. The basic unit will handle up to 5.0 liters of 
engine capacity.

About ten years ago I adapted CIS to a 914 2.0. I had to make a plenum 
and new runners, but it ran like stink. Much better that the timed 
stuff.

Give me high butterfly mechanical injection on the big motors. Expensive
but simple.

To the gentleman with the 928 blowing white smoke, if your car has two 
valve heads, it won't be a cheap repair for the head gaskets, but much
simpler. If it's a four valve, well, I hope you got it cheap. The motor
has to come out, a 15 hour job to R&R. ( I've done one, so don't give
me some quick and dirty, there isn't one for them).

If you want to get more airflow for your CIS, use the V-8 sensor plate
and the 3.0 Carrera (euro) fuel distributor. Factory Carrera cams work 
fine. Timed fuel injection is a mixed blessing as the comprimises 
included are for regulatory and longevity issues. The single product 
from LUCAS that I would consider are the engine management units used
in F1 and Indy car racing. No single hot wire, but they don't compromise
much. Going fast is expensive, I'd recommend using the best chip UNLESS
your profession is developing one of those systems. GM has about 24
engineers assigned to the Chevrolet engine management systems. That's
a lot of full time, focused talent doing this stuff. I agree with
Mark DeHaas on the level of design talent reqired.

what they're doing. (510) 829-2050

Alberta does not require (or issue) front plates so, obviously, I don't
have one.  In the last month I've spent several days in BC with no problem. 

I would hope that the Alberta Gov't wouldn't set such a policy if it
would cause Alberta drivers grief in the neighboring province.  Of

Hi injection-talkers,

Hot-wire systems work on different principles than vane-type systems:

Vane systems use the volume of air entering the engine to mechanically 
move a potentiometer, giving a varying output voltage or current 
directly (depending on how you'd like to interpret things) related to 
the air volume.  This is simple but does not compensate for air density 
(altitude or other barometric changes).

So called hot-wire systems use a current flow to heat a wire which is 
tensioned in the incoming air flow.  Passing air cools the wire and 
changes its resistance, altering the current flow.  Electronics detect 
this and therefore know the *mass* of air (not volume) entering the 
engine.  This technique does compensate for barometric changes and is 
generally more accurate and less prone to mechanical failure.

Hot-wire sensors don't "put out" any voltage.  In fact, they do nothing 
if they aren't heated via sufficient current (like a fuse, sort of).  
The electronics supporting a hot-wire system are a little more 
complicated than mechanical potentiometer systems, but not by much.  
It's the remaining stuff that drives the injectors and controls the 
timing that's a big deal.

Simply changing the metering box from vane to hot-wire will gain a 
measurable but inconsequential reduction in intake flow resistance.  
It's a lot of work for practically no gain, and this is on an 
electronic vane system.  Adapting a K-Jetronic to behave this way would 
be a great academic exercise and would delight a few parts supply 
companies, but likely wouldn't startle you with new found power, IMHO!

Bob,

I don't know about the front plates.  Since Washington requires them, not 
many
Seattleites think about it much.  However,  there are a couple of other 
things to be
aware of when coming up to Whistler Weekend.  I can't remember whether I've 
seen
you and Vicki at Whistler before, so if this is all old hat to you, maybe 
there's
someone else on the forum that can benefit.  The road up to Whistler from
Vancouver is a perfect Porsche road (when you're not behind a Winnebago), 
except:

 - The RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police)  know when we're coming
   (and leaving) and they wait just for us.

 - They tend to hide behind boulders at a bend in the road, wait for a 
Porsche to
   come along, and then jump out into the road to signal you to pull over. 
 It's a
   rather startling experience.

 -  They have photo radar on the road up, but tend to place it in the 
straights.
    It's the twisty bits that make the road fun anyway.

 -  The RCMP don't act anything like the Dudley DoWright I remember.

 -  If you're coming over to Washington, going up Hwy 5, and crossing the 
border
    there, the border wait is averaging about 2 1/2 hours.  The truck 
crossing a
    bit to the East, (sorry, can't remember the name of the town) is usually 
quicker.

As local authorities are empowered to only enforce the rules,

 I wouldn't worry about it. They can't enforce the regulations of the

They would have to hold you until some one from your home state or

Not likely in Canada or the US. Nothing is scared about harrassment just

Subject: 914s for sale


There a couple of nice 914s for sale in Dublin, Calif. 

the first is a 1972 914, need some paint, but mechanically great. It has 1.8 barrels and pistons. No structural rust that we can find. 
$3,000, call Liz Stiffler at (510) 829-2049

the second is a very nicely done 1973 914 2.0 with FULL PCA race/time-
trial preparation. Still very street-driveable with 911 front drakes and
5-bolt wheel conversion, Weltmeister torsion bars, sway bars, springs, 
7" cooker cutters inclused with A008R tires. $7,200 Robert Stiffler at
(510)829-2049   Robert has done a very sanitary job on this car, if you
are looking for a track vehicle or fast autocrosser, this is a good one.


About 924, 931, 944, 951 and 968 lowering, no matter what method you 
use, keep the lower arms parallel in respect to the ground and front
crossmember. Any lower will cause some `porpoising' across unevent
pavement in corners. If you lower the body in respect to the length of
the shock absorber, you must also shorten the shaft of the shock to
keep the shaft from ramming the bottom and destroying the adjustment
mechanism. Carrera Shock made me specially shortened ones for my 914/6
to improve suspension travel at a low ride height.

There is nothing funnier than one of these kids in a mini-truck that's 
lowered to leave muffler tracks in the pavement showing a pair of 
front shocks that have bent. I've seen afew out of 914s.

One option that Porasche should include for the urban operators of the 
marque is one for twin Spandau machine-guns to use on the dorks that 
insist on playing dumb by driving in a less than opitimal manner in 
front of a Porsche. Where's the Red Baron when you need him the most???

At some point, reducing tire diameter is clearly a bad idea, but
I'm not convinced that Porsche equips all of its cars with tires of
optimum size.  For example, in Solo II CS autocrossing, competitive 944's 
use smaller, lower profile tires than the original equipment.  The
change in gearing is helpful, but so is the wider (and shorter)
tire patch.  In many cases, I suspect that Porsche's choice of tires 
is dictated by factors such as body clearance, ride quality, ground 
clearance, gearing, and availability rather than optimum track or
autocross performance.  

In my case, before I switched to lower profile tires in front,
I had to put 10-12 psi more pressure in my front tires
than in my rear tires to balance the handling of my car at the track.  
With the increased pressure, I doubt that 225/50's have a longer footprint
than 225/45's.

Subject: License plates and Whistler Weekend


Hello All,
     Two parts: One, I live in Washington State which requires a front 
plate, I recently bought a 928 in Oregon which has no front plate.  I've 
been driving it around for about 3 weeks now and have not had any problems, 
and because the car was from out of state I had to take it to the State 
Patrol to have it inspected, and they didn't say anything about not having a 
front plate.  (I did find out I am missing the door sticker though <smile>). 
 Anyone have a 928 front license plate mount they want to sell?
     Part two:  For us new comers to porshcephiles, could someone give me a 
brief rundown of what Whistler Weekend is and what goes on there?  Thanks 
folks!...

Subject: RE:76 911 Ignition cut-out

I once had a car (not a splendiferous PORSCHE) that would 'turn off' at
fwy speeds. This would happen at any time, but it seemed only on the fwy.
I'd pull over and adjust the points, get in and start the car right up.

After much consternation, I found that when the distributor advanced,
a solder joint would ground against the body. Since this only happened
with the distributor advanced, it was a tricky problem to track down.

So, first check your point gap, as this is most often the culprit, then
look for anomolies such as a faulty coil wire or loose contact point
mount.

Subject: Re: '67 911, now what?


I can relate to your quandry, having just completed a complete
metal restoration (body-wise) on a '66 912 which was stored for
10 years prior to my purchase.  It was a total rust bucket.

I dis-assembled the car and then used paint stripper to remove
all the undercoating/paint/etc.  I also did at least four full
days worth of sand blasting on rust areas.
Then, replaced the floor pans, inner/outer rockers, door jams,
hinge posts, trailing arm support sheet metal, and 25+ patches throughout
the car.  It took me a year to do it.

Depending on the sales/swap meets the sheet metal ran 
about $1000 or so.  Its the LABOR/TOOLS/MATERIALS that 
costs the big bucks.  In Illinois, I found a place that
will make custom sheet metal and its .1 the price of P-car metal.
I just bring in the hold hunk of metal and they make a new one.

Find a local who likes that kind of work - I found a guy who was
willing to do the welding/fitting through a local paint supply shop,
I asked for someone who was good and worked in his garage.
A german car shop will also probably have some names.

I did all the grunt work - stripping, grinding, disassembly, patch
forming, etc. and left the welding and final fitting to him.  This
saved major money.  Expect to pay $2000+ for someone to do it all.
It cost me $1400 for welding/fitting work, after I had already 
stripped and disassembled the car.

Redi-Strip will bead blast the outside of your car for about $500
which saves a huge amount of time.  If they "dip" the car, its
about $1500 and does a even better job, and saves even more time.
I would do this were I to do it again.

Bottom Line,  you have to look at this as a hobby and be willing
to learn a lot, spend a lot on tools, air compressor?, and parts.
If you cant wait 1+ years to just get the body back in shape,
assuming you work 40+ hours per week for a living, then look for a nice
used one.  I get depressed every show/swap meet I go to and
see $7k 912s and $10k 911s that aren't all that bad.  I
easily have $8k++ in mine, I paid $2.5k for it and the rest is
parts/labor - I still am assembling it, and it aint even painted yet.
I wont even mention the interior.....

At this point, I quit counting it all up.  I justify it by telling
myself its a hobby, I enjoy working on it, and where else could
I find a perfect example of a vintage sports car for $12k (my current
estimate of final investment).  I like my 912 a whole lot more
than if I had bought some goofy mazda or corvette (no offense to
mazdo and 'vette owners).  My $944 friend has out-spent me on
parts/labor in the last year, so hook up with someone who
spends more than you do (no offense to $944 owners), we use
the '$' as a joke when we talk/email about our cars.

Good luck, and dont get depressed.  I'm sure I am not the only
one out there who has more $$ in their restoration than the
car is worth.  You have to include the non-tangibles, and then
its worth while.

I live in Santa Barbara, CA and drive down to LA often and I haven't had a
front license plate on my car for more than 11 years and haven't had any
problems.  Maybe I'm just lucky.......

Subject: weight

The 76 930 weighed about 2550 lbs.  Later 911 turbos weighed 
around 3100 lbs or so.  Was the weight difference in performance
parts, safety requirements or luxury fat?

Does anyone have weights of 930s and 911 turbos under comparable
conditions from 1976 to present?  Where is a good place to look?
Is there a difference between USA and Euro models?

Subject: washing the engine comp. and tire choice??


I was planning to use the oldest method of surface cleaning the engine
including the bay with a water spray gun (low pressure). Is this a primitive
method. Any reason NOT to do it. I was also planning to do same to the under-car 
- ------------------------------------------
more down to the ground---

My car it seems had a number of tires (6 plus?) mounted over the last
25,000 miles. The tires that the previous owner insisted on purchasing
(Donlup D40/M2 front: 205/55Z/16R rear: 225/50Z/16R) 

I would be inclined to conclude that the tread-ware is very high (he did not
mind paying list $price$ and often, I DO)

What would you falks use if you were replacing all four. Can I do with replacing 
just two at a time to another tire type (eg. BFG, Dunlop P8000...)

Thanks for the HELP in advance!

Bad Permatune units mostly cut out in hot temperatures.  I think 
people most of the time change their units during summer time 
due to higher temperatures.
