Subject: input needed on custom short stroke 911 motor...please

 
hi, i could use any input from anyone out there, what i have is
3.0 turbo case
2.2s crank and rods
complete 77s 911 motor core
set of like new 3.3 turbo cly
 
what my plans are is to put the 2.2s crank in the 3.0 liter case
using the 66mm s rods and my 3.3 97mm turbo liners, have some
hi compresion pistons like 9.8-10.3 /1 made up to fit 
the 97mm turbo liners,and use all the stuff off the
2.7 motor..i.e layshaft,cam towers,sheetmetal,oil cooler
chain cases..ect...ect. i think that would make a nice
short stroke 2.9 liter motor
 
what would you recommend for...
 
 1. heads to use, i was thinking on 79 3.0 sc heads or 3.2 liter
 
 2. internal oil pump, like the 3.0 or 3.3 turbo
 
 3. cam selection, im going to use this mainly as a "street racer", so i was thinking
    of the mfi s or e grind
 
 4. the best/easiest fuel system either carbs or if not that great then getting
    a modified mech. fuel injection system
    
 5. what would the "safe" top end red line on this motor would be
 
 and...
 
 6. anything else that may prevent this configuration from acually running
    or any other input from you would again be "GREATLY" APPRICIATED

Steve, 
Do not be discouraged by this experience. Hood shocks are
gas filled and, unlike Bilstein shocks, are shipped loose and
fully extended in cartons of up to 500 pcs from the manufacturer
in Germany. This sometimes causes the shafts to become pitted,
bent and for the seals to leak prematurely. This is not real common,
but not unheard of. You should find that your dealer knows about
this and will replace them. If not, get 'em from your friendly
Porsche mail order house from Pano. Nothing wrong with the product.

Sounds like you have a frozen brake calliper piston.  If that is the case,
you probably want to have a mechanic rebuild it and its three siblings.
The rebuild kits themselves are obscenely expensive.  You should
hope that disassembly, cleaning, and reassembly is sufficient.  But

Subject: 911 oil scum


It has been stated that the 911 can get this yellowish scum at the top
of the oil tank and in the hose that goes from the tank to the engine
(breather hose?). 

That's very true and if the car has been abused alot (short trips
which does not allow the oil to get warm) this scum gets collected
at the bottom of the oil tank.

The scum that owned my car before me appearantly collected a lot
of the oil scum in the tank. The problem is to get the tank clean
without removing it... You can get a piece of cloth on a wire up
through the drain hole but it's tricky. The breather hose can
easily be detached from the oil tank and cleaned (partially).

The bottom line is as stated before: get the oil really warm and
change oil regulary.

I've seen specific information, too probably in a late
'70's Panorama. It might also be in Paul Frere's 911
book. I heard that Porsche has one of the first galvanized
bodies "in the zinc" on display outside the factory, so 
maybe Peter can answer this one.

As a point of reference, my '73 911 was partially 
galvanized. I'm not sure how much, but the whole
underside, fenders and wells and the rear valance
appeared to be galvanized. The only part that ever 
rusted was under the chrome kick-plates (at the top
of the rocker panels) and I think that was just because
water could get in there and take forever to dry out.

Subject: Re: '73 914 2.0 fuel injection


Dear Bart and everyone,

All 914 2.0 fuel injected engines start, run rough and die three times before
running smoothly when they are cold. the auxillary air valve, open when cold
adds more air for smoother idle when cold. After about five minutes, it heats
and closes. The problem with these valves (shaped like a barrel with a 90
degree hose fitting on top and a red wire exiting the bottom), is that over
the years, water vapor collects in them and rusts the valve shut. To repair,
pry off the top then sand and clean the valve until it slides smoothly and
then recrimp the top.

We have to fix these valves because new ones are totally unavailable and used
ones are expensive ($125.00). These companies you mentioned have varying
prices because they are all not selling the same thing. Bosch has superceded
the 1.7, 2.0 valve with the 1.8 variety and that is what Performance and
Stoddard are selling. And call Automobile Atlanta or AJ Racing. I'm sure at
that price it is the real thing, but I bet neither has stock to sell you! At
least Tweeks knows they are no longer available.

You definitely need an auxiliary air valve for smooth cold running, so fix
yours!

Three different head temp sensors were used on the 914 and some are more
expensive than others, but all will work. Order a generic cheap one or more
expensive matched one. These sensors provide increased resistance when cold
for a richer mixture and when not, almost no resistance for lean mixture.
Sometimes 914s become too lean when hot, so the factory trick is to add a 270
ohm resistor in line with the head sensor. this guarantees some residual
enrichment throughout the temperature range.

Dear Bryan(and all),

It's easy to independently wire the driving light! They were originally wired
to the low beams for US Federal regulations, but now, who cares?

Two wires need to be switched and the they are as follows:
     1. The white with blue striped wire exiting the 85 terminal on the
foglight relay has to be connected to a hot source. (The wire goes to the
high low beam relay on 70/71 and to the low beam on the fuseblock (fuse No.1)
on the '72 and later vehicles).
     2. The black with blue wire on the driving light switch terminal 15
needs to be connected to a hot source. It is originally connected to terminal
58b on the early 70/71 914s or terminal 56 on the 72 and up 914s on the
headlight switch.

Number one originally allows the lights to be operated only in the low beam
position while No.2 originally allows the driving lights to be operated only
when the headlamps are on. Sourcing differently switched hot sources for
these two wires will give you the driving light action you prefer.

You can easily lower the front of your 914 as long as it is not any lower

level surface, from the center of the rear torsion bar to the ground on each

Subject: 914 Speakers and Airheads

          Greetings,

          Regarding the discussion on Porsche 914 stereo systems: I
          was always disappointed with the bass response from those
          dinky front speakers in the 914.  On the other hand, I
          didn't want to hack away at my car to install bigger
          speakers in a non-stock location.  So, I designed a
          subwoofer box with an 8" woofer -- it fits right in-between
          the two passenger seats (where the "third" seat used to be.)
          I designed the box to be removable, so that if I ever feel
          like having a stock 914, I just un-plug it (removing the
          crossover from the speaker loop) and put the pad back in.  I
          actually like having a raised box on the left -- it's the
          perfect arm rest height.  Also, I upholstered it in black
          vinyl to fit in the decor.  If anyone is interrested,  I
          could try to relate the basic design to you and tell you
          which woofers and crossover components to use.  (I used to
          have a speaker company I ran as a hobby before I got called
          up on my active duty Air Force assignment.)

          Regarding the flying discussion:  I am a current (student)
          pilot with 48 hours.  I take my FAA practical test in a week
          or two.  Wish me luck!

Subject: K&N filter concern

 
Hi, Larry.
 
The cloud of gas you describe is sometimes called "fuel standoff." You can
run a VW or 356 without an air cleaner, but you have to rejet the thing to
compensate for the leaning out at high rpm without the filter. For example,
with a two-barrel Solex, each barrel "robs" some fuel from the cloud, in
other words some of the fuel kicked up by the other barrel, giving
an enriching effect. If you could contain all of each barrel's cloud in
velocity stacks, you wouldn't get this effect, but you would need very long
stacks to do it.
 
I once saw a guy struggling to get his 356 to run without misfiring at a
slalom. I looked down inside his carburetors and noticed that he had very
neatly cut a thin sheet of rubber to form a gasket to his nifty velocity
stacks. The rubber gasket did not have any holes for the air correction
jets. When somebody pointed this out to him, he took off his stacks and gasket
and ran it again, and it misfired just as before. Reason: his air correction
jets were working again, but without the stacks he was still leaning it out
due to blown away standoff. Once he cut holes in the gasket and put the stacks
back on, the misfiring was considerably reduced. It still needs rejetting.
 
I found some stacks at a swap meet and began to fool with them on my car.
As expected, and just as everybody had told me, switching to stacks made the
engine go lean at high rpm. I went to smaller air correction jets, and that
helped, but I also had to go to bigger mains. I tested by putting my German time
 -speed-distance test rig on the car and measuring time intervals for every 5
mph in full-throttle 2nd gear acceleration. The funny thing is, with all that
induction noise coming from the back, you think "yeah, I'm really moving now"
but the test printout shows that the car is actually LOTS slower unless you do
a lot of rejetting -- and have an effective means to measure the performance
difference (dyno or road test gear; lots of stopwatch timing and averaging
otherwise).

Bill Elwell's response is the only one so far that emphasises the effects of
weight transfer, is the most cogent and I feel the only correct one so
far. Thanks for blowing away the smoke, Bill.
 
It is possible to spin just about any car by unloading the rear end. I have
even spun a VW GTI by braking hard in a turn. The GTI is more forgiving than
the 911 in this but the laws of physics remain the same.
 
Getting off the gas as the first action in a spin is just basically wrong,
especially in a 911 but in most cars. POWER STABILIZES THE REAR END. If it's
starting to go, there's a good chance it is doing so because you backed off
or braked, unloading the rear. Load it up again. Steer. This may not always
be possible because you are running out of road, etc. and the spin is going
to be inevitable. Given unlimited space to recover, most spins can be caught
again. Given you are trying to recover AND make the next cone/guardrail/etc.
recovery may no longer be possible. Try to keep as much power on the back, or
stay off the brakes as much as possible, while steering out of it.
 
Once you've lost the car completely, both feet in, steer as best you can, and
wait.
 
And yes, I do spin at slaloms.

Hi, Eric.
 
Ludvigsen was written in 1977, when the 928 was hot stuff and Porsche was
running 934s and 935s. An update will be very welcome.
 
Yup, "Anderson" is Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance Handbook.

I don't recommend trying this on purpose (!) but I once swapped ends in
my 911SC at speed. I managed to keep the car under control by looking out
the rear window and driving it backwards while gently braking to a stop.

When I bought my 82 911SC it had the Automotion short shift, which I found
too short. I changed over to the factory kit and like it much better. It all
depends on how short a shift you want. The internal quality of the factory
kit seems a little better too. Both kits are easy to install. 
If you're interested in the Automotion kit, I'd be willing to sell it...

 -single-sided front suspension, with shock located behind the steering axis
 -140hp, 4-cyl, with variable valve timing (variomatic?), FI w/DME
 -shaft drive, w/seperate control arm to minimize shaft effect.
 -6-speed with electronic control, shifting by std. lever, or rocker sw.

When You Wish Upon a Star - Part II

Some time later, sitting in La Guardia Airport, the magnitude of the
moment had yet to smash its way into my head.  My entire body was
tingling, my stomach twisted with an odd combination of excitement and
dread.  After all, I was embarking on a mission the successful
completion of which would transform a lifetime dream into reality.  In
addition, I was about to spend more money than I'd ever spent in my
life on something that many people would call frivolous and
self-indulgent.  Visions of poor, starving children in drought-ridden
Ethiopia and, for that matter, on the Park Avenue median, flashed
through my mind.  Unable to withstand the burden of guilt weighing on
my conscience, I quickly jumped up and ran down the terminal.  John
and Karl, babbling about some kind of pressure chain fed update
tensioner, were oblivious to my action.  I had no idea where I was
going, but I was clearly being driven by some benevolent force, for
there, in front of me, was a small, thin, pathetic looking child - the
word orphan written all over him.

"Hey kid," I huffed, realizing that I'd run about two
miles. "Why do you have `orphan' written all over you like
that?'

"Huh?" the kid responded, suspiciously turning towards me.

"Never mind, you poor child," I said.  "Is it tough being an
orphan?"

"Orphan?  I'm no..."

"Parents killed in an auto accident?"  I figured that seemed the most
likely cause, these days. 

"They were???" he responded, wildly searching the Airport with his
eyes.

"That's just terrible.  I'm sure they never meant for you to be
alone in the world," I said, reaching into my wallet.  The poor kid
had become frantic, and had started to cry.  I figured he was calling
up memories of his parents death, which was probably a good thing for
him to face up to. In fact I remembered that "hail hail fire and
snow" episode of Star Trek where McCoy told Kirk that it was
unhealthy for a bunch of children whose parents had just died not to
be crying.

"Mooooooommmmmmeeeeeee," he cried.

"There there," I comforted.  "I know it's hard to accept, but
crying is good, you should let it out.  Here's a few bucks for you.
I'll bet your parents would have wanted you to go to college, so put
that in the bank and with interest it'll be ten dollars one day."

By now the kid was hysterical, and I figured he needed to be left
alone, so I headed back to the terminal, my conscience clear after
having done my good deed.  I was now ready to be self indulgent, and
as I approached John and Karl (who were still unaware of my absence) I
couldn't help but notice a faint, shimmering haze which seemed to
surround them.  Although I dismissed it as a slight misting in my eyes
(the result of my recent emotional experience with that poor orphaned
boy), in the back of my mind things were beginning to click together,
and I was becoming dimly aware that other forces were at play here,
forces that would not allow me to fail in my quest.

We boarded the plane, found our seats, and unloaded the 200 pounds of
Porsche literature John had brought for our perusal.  I was amazed at
the amount of material that had been written on these cars.  By the
end of the flight, I already felt I was an expert on all aspects of
the 911.  I learned that the topic of the discussion in the terminal
had been the carrera pressure fed chain tensioner update, and why it
was so important.  I learned the likely rust spots on older 911s, how
to check for the original paint and crashes, and read about a million
articles on how improve performance.  Each step in my Porschezation
was more astonishing than the previous.

We landed in LA, and went to get our bags.  To our surprise, they
actually check your baggage claim ticket before you are allowed to
leave the baggage pickup area with luggage.  This singular experience
caused a surge of anxiety until I found my claim ticket, which for
some reason I hadn't thrown out as I usually do.  However, I was
still resisting the truth, and chose to attribute even this startling
stroke of luck to chance.

The next shocker was waiting for us at the luggage pickup area.  Every
single piece of luggage we had checked in at LaGuardia had NOT ended
up in Cleveland.  Through some miracle, not only had they reached LA,
but they were undamaged AND they came out rather quickly.  Even John
and Karl were starting to wonder how we could be so lucky.  Karl's
bag was the last of our bunch to show up, and I spotted it and elbowed
my way into position to grab it as it was conveyed by.  I reached out
my hand, grasped the handle, and was immediately pulled onto the
conveyor belt, past the rubber curtain thingy, and into the mystical
other dimension that no one ever sees.

For some reason, Karl's bag had gotten stuck to the conveyor belt,
which I hadn't accounted for when I grabbed the handle.  The
unexpected jolt had me temporarily dazed; I slowly recovered and tried
to gauge my surroundings.  The conveyor belt was traveling in a dense
fog, through which I could barely make out huge piles, of unknown
composition, up ahead.  As I approached I was able to discern the
contents of each pile, and I was taken aback.  One pile contained only
unmatched socks, another pile was of hammers and screwdrivers, another
contained pencils and pens, then a pile of keys, followed by wallets,
tire valve stem caps, hockey pucks, every superball ever made, and old
game show hosts.  The fog began to thin ever so slightly, and I could
see other piles, and thousands of other luggage conveyor belts, all
moving as if they would converge ahead.  I strained my eyes to see
through the fog, and slowly it became clear that I was approaching a
city of some sort, where all the baggage conveyor belts were indeed
converging.  I saw, to my horror, that all the thousands of belts were
merging into one belt that was of the same width.  The point of
convergence was a deafening chaos of baggage, colliding and bouncing
in all directions.  Very few pieces of luggage were actually staying
on the new conveyor belt, most were ricocheting off into the
surrounding city (which I recognized almost immediately as Cleveland,
thanks to the sign reading "Welcome to Cleveland - City of Lost
Luggage").  The speed of my conveyor belt was increasing
dramatically as it neared the city, and before I knew it I was
hurtling towards the baggage vortex.  Not having any time to react, I
just held on tight to Karl's suitcase and closed my eyes as we
plunged into the swirling maelstrom of luggage.  I'm not sure what
happened next, but when I opened my eyes, I was just coming back
through the dimensional barrier into the LAX baggage claim area.  John
and Karl were standing there, smiling.

"I forgot to tell you," Karl said, in addition to his German
accent, he tended to draw trailing vowels out for hours.  "I brought
all my tools with me." With this he heaved his suitcase off the
conveyor belt, plopping it on the floor beside him.  Still in a daze
from my visit to the land of the lost, I summonned the will to move
and rolled off the belt myself.

"I thought it was stuck," I mumbled.

"Not stuck, just heavy," he replied.  "How was it back there?"

"I'm just happy to be alive," I said, pocketing the housekeys I
had lost in sixth grade (at least my trip hadn't been a total loss).

With a deep breath, we proceeded out of the building, John and I
carrying, and Karl dragging, our respective luggage.  We were greeted
with a blast of blistering LA smog, and all collapsed onto the
pavement, gasping for air.

"Welcome to LA, mang!" someone said, with a chuckle.

We slowly regained our composure and climbed to our feet.  The sun
blared at through the greyish air, and I squinted up at the sky.  Not
a cloud to be seen.  There was a bright flash as a plane dipped its
wing and reflected the sunlight.  Had I taken the time to think about
it, I would have realized that the plane could not possibly have
reflected the sun, the angles were all wrong.

The search was about to begin.

I used to have a simple system in my Targa - Alpine tape deck, Nakamichi
amp run as 90w x 2, and Nakamichi separates (3 inch tweeters, 5.25 inch
mids) in the doors.  The system never had lower end bass but it still
sounded nice.  There was no problem hearing it with the top off up to
80mph.  Over 80mph the noise of having the top off drastically increases.
The only other thing I would have added to that system was another amp
and a subwoofer.

Subject: Questions about '82 euro 930

Hi,
I am the proud new owner of a european '82 930. It has adjustable turbo
boost, and boy is it fast. Yes, I have read Bruce Anderson's excellent
book, and I have seen the picture of the melted piston and cylinder. So
I am trying to restrain myself and only go to 1.5 bar for a few memorable
seconds per month. Based on Bruce's advice I called up Callaway to get
details on the "Microfueler" fuel enrichment device for overboosted
turbos, but it is no longer available. Callaway now specializes in
domestic non-turbo V8s. So I guess that if I intend to run at higher boost
settings for more than a few seconds I should get an oversized 
intercooler, but first I need to take care of other items.

I have lots of questions. Sorry if these are stupid ones but after 
spending over $ 300 on books and manuals I still don't have any place I 
can look up the answers. There is no Porsche dealer in southern New 
Hampshire, and this is a euro model so dealers aren't paricularly
helpful anyway. Besides, dealers want to fix problems, not to tell me how
I can fix it myself.

1) Does anyone know where to get the service manual for the euro turbos ?
I bought the (expensive!) manual from Performance Products but it only has
the US versions, and skips the model years where no turbo was officially 
imported in the US. I can read German ('cause I grew up there).
I know that the turbo manual is only supposed to cover those items that
are different from the regular 911, and that I would haver to buy the 
other two volumes to be complete, but because of the US / Euro difference
I want to locate the correct versions before I pay another $250 per volume. 

2) In my front trunk, there is a cylindrical item with two hoses
 connected, labelled Purolator (nothing else is legible due to rust on
 this item). Since there are little black things falling out of holes,
 and since it smells a little bit like fuel, two mechanics I have shown
 this to think that it is a charcoal canister for the fuel tank breather,
 but everyone believes this is a nonstandard item perhaps added by the
 importers of the car. Question: Should a '82 930 have a charcoal canister
 installed by the factory ? Where would it be installed and what does it
 look like ? As I was checking out my car, I have seen many items I can't
 figure out. In the left front wheel well, there seems to be a plastic
 tank like object above what appears to be the windshield washer fluid 
 container. Could that possibly be the original fuel tank breather box ?

3) I found that my windshield washer pump was disconnected and appeared 
 dead, so I opened it up, removed some sand that was stuck between the 
 gears, and the pump spins now. I connected the hoses, but it didn't 
 pump the fluid. I figured out that it needs a T-style check valve, 
 and ordered it from Automotion, but I am confused by the fact that 
 there are three hoses to hook up to the pump. One goes up to the 
 windshield nozzles, and two apparently come from the tank. I
 tried every logical way of using the T connector but the pump still 
 only pulls water out of the tank only for as long as the tank is 
 completely full (i.e. water level is up to the filler) So why are 
 there two hoses from the tank ? Is one for priming the pump and the
 other for pulling water out of the bottom ? How exactly should they
 be connected to the T valve and the pump ?

4) My headlight washer pump doesn't work. After ordering the factory
 owner's manual, I found that it is only supposed to work when the
 headlight is on. OK, so I tried it. I hear a relay clicking, and the
 relay is located close to the windshield washer pump. But I can't find
 the actual headlight washer pump, or any location where any loose hoses
 and electrical cables would suggest that it should be installed there.
 So where should I be able to find the headlight washer pump ?

5) Everything I have read about the 930 suggests that I should have truly
 amazing brake performance. My brakes work, but they are not at all
 impressive. My '83 Toyota stops better. Three local mechanics have 
 taken a quick look at the pads and rotors and suggested that they 
 "pass inspection" and don't need replacement any time soon. Oh yeah,
 sometimes the brake failure light comes on (and stays on until the 
 battery is disconnected). I wonder if the brake booster could be at
 fault, and if there is an easy way for me to check it out ?

6) It is missing the rear anti-roll bar. I only intend to drive on 
regular streets, and mostly at legal speeds. (So what if I go from 
30mph to 60mph in 1.5 seconds... there is no acceleration limit!)
Should I bother to get an anti-roll bar ? If so, factory or Weltmeister ?
Handling currently is not good, but I don't know if there are other 
suspension problems, or if 930s are supposed to handle this way, or
if it is all related to the lack of the rear anti-roll bar. It would be
so great if I could find a buddy with a similar car within driving 
distance!

7) With great interest I read the recent item about optimal jacking
 points. In fact I had just bought one of those little hydraulic jacks
 with two jack stands ($35 at Walmart). Unfortunately, the description
 "front cross support beam" and "Engine with wood blocks" is still a 
 little vague for me. I am horrified at the thought of damaging the car
 by jacking it up wrong, so I would appreciate more details.

Thanks! Ray

Subject: spinning



There is a great deal of similarity spinning P-cars and aircraft

As an unwritten rule, regardless of ability spin and you will crash

Sure practice spinning with plenty of space (H ov V) will help you 
recognise the onset of a spin, and hopefully allow you to back off, in 
each case releasing applied pressure to the pointing device will unload 
the surfaces and re-attach wheels to road or air to wing. So the advise 
is generally sound.

If you make a habit of driving beyond the limit of adhesion, eventually 
you will come to grief, think about what happens when you are doing a 
progressive power slide and you hit a nice patch of diesel whoops!!

As they say - very chuckable - not very catchable.

All the above of course does not apply if your name is Pete - if you've 
got it - thrash it!!

Some years ago - lost in Paris - ended up driving round the Arc de 
Triuphe, must have looked bemused.

Next lights frenchman draws alongside, and explained the insurance 
position of driving around the arc-

he explains in perfect english - if you have a bump at the arc, french 
insurance will not pay out - they reason that you don't have to drive 
round the arc - if you want to avoid crunches, go some other route.

I thought that was marvelous gallic logic - perhaps if US courts applied 
the same logic to product liability, some of the stupid court decisions 
may have been avoided I am thinking particularly about woman who have 
breast implants that go wrong, people who roll jeeps etc.

Whats the verdict?

Well, I can't comment directly on the 911 vs. the MR2, but I did own a '91
MR2 Turbo before "moving up" to my 944 Turbo.

MR2 Pros:  It's fast (but don't even consider the non-turbo).  Front end
feels nimble and responsive, thanks to mid-engine layout.  Great view out the
front, as hood drops off sharply.  Feels like driving a toy Ferrari.
It's very much a true "sports car", and quite fun to drive.

MR2 Cons:  Engine is loud, and the noises are not especially endearing.
Handling is very unbalanced;  lift-throttle oversteer is a real problem.
(I suppose the 911 has much the same behavior -- this either is good or bad,
depending on your point of view)  Handling is improved on '93 and later models.
It was surprisingly maintenance intensive (for a Toyota) -- don't expect it
to be like a put-gas-in-it-and-go-100K-miles Corolla.  The build quality
was not up to what I expect from Toyota;  little things would break, and the
interior seemed cheesy.  The car is very small, both in seating area and
storage, which became more annoying to me as time went by.
Finally (and I can't explain this well), the car lacks "character".  It seemed
anonymous and neutral -- no personality!.  Of course my Porsche has tons 
of character, my Toyota LandCruiser has character, even my Taurus SHO had 
some character.

In retrospect, I found that with the MR2, I initially loved it, and then, over
a year, got more and more annoyed with the thing -- finally I was happy to
let it go.  Whereas with the 944, I was at first unsure about the thing, but
as I drove it and got used to it, I got to appreciate it more and more. Now,
I won't give it up for anything.

In comparison, I think the 944 Turbo is clearly in a class above the MR2, in
performance, quality, and driver appeal.  I'm sure the same is true of the 911.
I've noticed that there are always *many* MR2's for sale in the local paper, 
whereas I know that there were not very many built.  That tells me people 
don't hang on to them very long, and neither did I.

A '91-'92 MR2 Turbo probably costs about $10-12K.  For the same money, your
friend could get a nice '86-'87 944 Turbo, or even an '80-'82 911sc for not
much more (??).  BTW, my '89 944 w/ 50Kmi feels alot newer, tighter, and less 
worn than my '91 MR2 did w/ 50Kmi.

I predict that if your friend goes for the MR2, he'll be back knocking on our
door before long.  Just my (admittedly biased) opinion.

One other thing to check is the parking brake cable. If it clogs up

it could cause the parking brake shoes to stay extended against
their drums (which are, btw, in the hubs of the rear disk rotors).

Although if the rotor is turning blue, then it is probably a frozen

  (snip)

    The rear sway bar will tighten up the rear end and in my experience
  will increase the dreaded "trailing throttle oversteer" which tends to swap
  911 ends...Without the bar at all your car will tend to understeer more, but
  may make it more like a "regular car" in terms of handling.
    If you aren't going to track the car I'd certainly avoid anything stiff 
  (a big bar or poly bushings) if possible and stick to stock. You don't 
  mention what you don't like about the handling (and I am certainly not a 
  talented driver who knows that much about setting up cars) but make sure
  that everything is working the way it -should- (shocks, bearings, ball
  joints). In stock form your 930 should be thoroughly awesome, unless you
  have a lot of 911 time on the track and are really good.  A friend (a
  talented 944 pilot) lost his stiffly sprung 911 after lifting the throttle
  during a lane change (spun his car backwards over the curb, into a tree, 
  caught on fire and burned his flared, 3 liter, Recaroed car to cinders)...
  Stiff isn't always better....

    For fun I used lift on sharp corners just to swing the rear around,
  I did this so much on old bushings that it broke the end of the up link
  loose from the trailing arm; after which the car just wouldn't
  swing around any more.

Why should the air heads be the only ones with a FAQ.  The 944 is the best

happy to help.  I'm not a 944 super tech but I do some of my own

One area I'd like to see addressed are the later models, specifically the

about them.  They're rare but *FUN* to drive and almost bullet proof.

I'd be happy to contribute my 951 S experiences to the FAQ.  I've also

Lee, et al:

I find it very hard to believe that anyone could spin a 911 by lifting
the throttle during a lane change. Please describe to us what kind of
lane change this person was making. There has to be some other reason
he lost control of the car. This sounds like someone trying to blame the
car for his own stupid mistake.

This "lift throttle oversteer" stuff is getting way blown out of preportion
here. I am not saying that the characteristic does not exists, because it
does. But a 911, even a "stiffly sprung 911", does not magically spin out
of control without some help from the driver. And certainly not when making
a lane change. If you understand what the 911 does and why it does it, you
are half way there. The other half is learning how to control your 911 at
edge. Go autocrossing! This will teach you more about your 911's handling
than anything else.

I've seen a couple *almost* happen when people are trying to do 90mph
"lane surfing" through 70mph traffic. Eventually, stuff happens and a
lane slows down unexpectedly - another Mallox moment!.  Of course none
of us porschephiles would do anything like that.


Funny how even I get some perverse satisfaction when it's a Porsche or

>Scott Winders

    In fact, said friend was coming BACK from an autocross when the accident
 occurred ! The lane change was an aggressive one between 2 cars; as he
 started the change, he got nervous about his (closing) distance to the car
 in front of him and let off the gas as he twitched the wheel.....he never
 had a chance to recover.
    His car was a '72 with flares, 7/8" wheels, and adjustable Weltmeister
 bars front and rear. He was new to the 911 (lost it something like 2
 months after he got it) but was a moderately experienced and talented
 944 autocrosser, around cars and racing all his life.
  
  I'd agree, the 911 is at least a consistent car and won't just spin out
 of nowhere. But they aren't forgiving to heavy-handling and stiffening
 them up exacerbates the situation. I'd bet most people would be just
 as happy without a rear sway bar at all.
 
  If you remember the video game shaped like a motorcycle, that you sit
 on and push the thing back and forth to steer ? I could never beat a
 friend who'd never driven a bike; he didn't KNOW he couldn't just throw
 the thing over, or be careful coming back off the "grass", or let off the
 gas in a corner...and unlike real life, the game didn't care either !
 My driving expertise is limited to knowing you can't upset the dynamics
 of a machine without expecting a result; in my Friends case, too much
 throttle change AND too much steering did him in. In his 944, it certainly
 wouldn't have happened (as he put it, a move he'd made "thousands of times").
 In my experience, a 911 can wag its tail all day long where a 928 just 
 never will.  And a stiffer rear bar means more oversteer. 

   And no, said Friend didn't blame the car for his driving ! And the
 people in the car he crashed and burned in front of (not to mention his
 wife, who nixed another purchase of a road-going Porsche) probably wasted 
 no word to impress on him their impression of his driving...!

Subject: Re: More stereo advice

Colin here is some more advice regarding your sub:

I will not say that the following advice offered by Tracy is necessarily 
"bad", but I might recommend taking some of it with a grain of salt.  
Opinions are given on the tubes, but let it be known that they *can* be 
mounted in the hatch if you so desire.  As Tracy comments, it is difficult 
to know what your idea of "good bass" is.  *My* general definition of "good 
bass" is bass that is "accurate".  That is, bass that is reproduced with all 
the same tonal qualities contained in the original recording with no 
disproportionate exaggeration or major distortions.  I would *strongly* 
discourage heeding the advice offered regarding a 10" free-air sub for use 
in your particular car.  Free-air subs are constructed differently than 
other conventional drivers intended for use in enclosures, and they have 
rather specific intended applications.  You should note that the description 
"free-air" does not imply that these drivers can simply be mounted anywhere, 
without a box.  It is true that they do not require a purpose built box such 
as other drivers do, but they must be very carefully mounted.  Free-air subs 
are specially manufactured to have expecially rigid suspensions to 
compensate for their lack of a conventional enclosure or box.  In general, 
free-air woofers are intended to be mounted in vehicles having a trunk on 
either the rear deck or on a baffle behind the rear seat.  In such an 
application, the specially made free-air drivers essentially use the entire 
trunk as their enclosure.  It is imperative when using a free-air sub that 
the front and back wave energy eminating from the speaker are completely 
isolated from one another.  That is, the front of the speaker should fire 
into the passenger compartment, and the back of the speaker should fire into 
the trunk, and the air between the two should not mix in any way.  As you 
can see, this is easily accompolished in a car with a trunk, and it allows 
for quick easy bass without the hassle of a box.  It clearly does not lend 
itself to use in a hatch car.  Free-air subs are designed to play into very 
large enclosures.....the size of a whole trunk!  If you were to mount a 
free-air sub in one of the back corner pockets, as Tracy suggests, you would 
obviously be violating this idea.  A free-air sub in such an improper 
application would almost definitely provide very exaggerated, "boomy" 
sounding bass rather than accurate bass.  As before, my advice is to buy or 
construct a suitable hatch sub-box, but listen to find what *you* prefer first.

In reference to the Boston Acoustics, they *are* (IMHO) very good sounding 
separates, but please keep in mind that these are only *OPINIONS*.  Sound is 
a very subjective thing, and what sounds good to person A, may not sound the 
same to person B.  I continue to stress the importance of making one's own 
decisions regarding sound unless you truly rely upon other's 
recommendations.  This advice applies to Tracy as well in choosing separates 
for your car.  Just for comparison's sake you might try auditioning a set of 
Canton's and A/D/S separates against the Boston's.  The important thing is 
to bring your own music that you are familiar with, and to carefully compare 
the two different sounds (side by side if possible).

Happy Listening!

Subject: Re: Roundabouts

        I, too, have had extensive experience in Paris when I was involved 
in a GUR (geographically undesirable relationship) and made 6 trips in 1.5 
years.  My first observation was that it seemed that every car I saw in the 
city was dented (even the several Porsches - which made me cry).  This is 
clearly unlike Tokyo were cars are taken directly from fender-benders to the 
autobody shop since no-one would dare drive a dented car and lose "face".
        On my 4th or 5th trip to Paris I learned why so many dents when I 
rented a car in Germany (unfortunately not a Porsche!) and drove to Paris.  
It seems that the Parisians are so arrogant that they refuse to accept the 
concept of "yield".  Furthermore, they will not acknowledge the idea of 
"lanes" either.  Now realize that I grew up and learned to drive in Boston 
and know the circles described previously quite well.  However, until Paris, 
I thought Boston drivers were some of the toughest and most agressive 
(except they don't usually drive on the sidewalkslike Parisians).  In my 
little Opel in Paris, I learned that when six cars converge on an the exit 
from a roundabout or entrance to an expressway, no one gives way until they 
*hit*, hence all the dents.
        Anyway I agree that simple small roundabouts are efficient (you 
enter and drive around until you get to your exit and you leave - not 
crossing the path of anyone else) but larger multiple lane roundabouts are a 
nightmare except in light traffic since you must work toward the inner lane 
once you get on and must work your way back out through merging traffic to 
get off.  Yes, the Brits have lots of them but then they drive on the wrong 
side of the road anyway <g>.

>From What I can recall, stiffening up the rear end *REDUCES* the tendency to
oversteer.  Stiffening the rear end reduces the tendency of the car to roll.
Roloing transfers weight from the inside rear tire to the outside.  As the car
becomes unbalanced in the rear it's ability to stick is diminished causing
it to break free earlier (one of the rear tires starts to loose traction)
In the absence of braking, it really depends upon the ratio of the stiffness
between the front and rear whether a car will oversteer (be loose) or
understeer (push), but in general which ever is "looser" will break
free first.

There's a great book called "Race Car Engineering and Mechanics" that explains
suspension set up and it's effect on a car's handling.  I'll post the author
and publisher when I get home and have access to the book.

Subject: Re: Amps hookup

Wayne,

I'm not familiar with your exact model head, but generally speaking it won't 
make a very significant difference in overall sound quality by upgrading 
your head.  The only significant gains that might stem from such an upgrade 
are in making the switch to CD from cassette if your head isn't already a CD 
player.  You may find more conveniences or features (and possibly a better 
tuner) with a new head, but most likely you will see little change in sound 
quality otherwise.

Regarding the connection question, check out an earlier post I made to 
Volney Spalding.  You should use either the DIN to DIN line or the RCA 
(these are also called phono jacks) pre-amp outputs.  Both should be 
low-level lines, and both should give simmilar results.  If you want to be 
sure they sound the same, switch between the two and listen for any 
differences, but it is highly unlikely that you will hear any change.  I am 
not sure what you mean by speaker RCA input because there is no such thing 
in my experience.  The RCA pre-amp inputs on your amp are low-level and 
should *only* be connected to RCA outputs from your head.  If you mean that 
your amp also accepts speaker-level inputs, then these are high-level inputs 
designed to take the line directly from the speaker lines from your head, 
but they should not be RCA style phone jack connectors as with the pre-amp 
input.

From: aclement@vt.edu (Andrew Clements)
Subject: Re: A question....This would be an answer!

Ok, Vol, here goes.....

I assume you know what amps and subs are.  Your head unit(cassette orCD) 
sends a low level signal (called a pre-amp signal) to your amp.  The amp 
then amplifies (duh) that signal and sends it out to the speakers or subs 
which are connected to it. Pretty simple so far.  What happens, however, is 
that you must use different speakers to reproduce different portions of the 
audible spectrum.  That is,  tweeters for the treble, midranges for 
everything in the middle, and subs for the bass.  The important part is that 
you must direct the proper frequencies to the proper speakers. You must not 
send the bass to the tweeters because it will fry them, and likewise if you 
send the treble to the subs it will dirty the sound of the bass.  Thus, this 
frequency chopping and directing is accompolished via a "crossover".  A 
crossover can also be thought of as a filter, and there are three basic 
types of crossovers.  1)low-pass filter  2)band-pass filter  and 3)high-pass 
filter.  As the name implies, a low-pass filter only allows the lows (bass) 
to pass through to the sub, a band-pass only allows a certain "band" of 
frequencies (no highs & no lows) to pass to the midrange, and so on.  I 
could write for a day on the technical aspects of various  crossover 
designs, but that is not practical.  Put simply, each x-over has a different 
"level" called a "SLOPE".  The slope refers to how quickly a x-over 
attenuates the frequencies that it filters off (how steep that chop is).  
Most common slopes are 
6 decibels per octave, 12 dB/octave, 18 dB/octave, and 24 dB/octave.  The 
steeper the slope, the less of the unwanted sounds seep through the filter.  
Now to complicate matters further, there are two basic varieties of 
crossovers.  One is the common passive x-over, and the other is the more 
expensive active (or electronic) x-over.  Basically, passives are simple 
elictrical devices ( either capacitors or inductor coils, and resistors) 
that are hooked up on the positive speaker lead between the amp and each 
speaker.  They are called passive because they require no power source, they 
just use a tiny bit of power directly from the speaker line.  Active 
x-overs, on the other hand, are more complex electrical units usually 
utilizing various IC chips.  The most important difference, however, is that 
you must use a separate amplifier for each of the different x-over "bands".  
This is because an active x-over is placed on the low level signal lines 
between the head-unit and the amps.  Basically, the signal comes from the 
head and is immediately dissected by the crossover.  Then, the appropriate 
sounds are sent to each amp ( for example, the bass frequencies travel to 
the amp powering the subs, and so on).  Active x-overs require their own 
power source (i.e. they must be connected to the car's battery), and they 
are more efficient than passives.  One of the many advantages of the active 
is that it is quickly adjustable (often with knobs) to change the desired 
crossover frequency (passives must be replaced with different component 
values to change the x-over frequency).  Actives are considerably more 
expensive themselves, plus, they require those extra amps.  Each type of 
crossover type has its advantages and disadvantages, but they all do 
essentially the same thing, and any good system should not be without them.


Does this explanation help?

Hello Vol!

Basically there are two types of outputs on most modern head-units.  The 
first type is the low-level (also called line-level or pre-amp level) signal 
output, and it usually exits the head via seperate left and right 
phono-connectors (also called RCA connecters).  The second is seperate left 
and right speaker-level outputs ( these are the one's carrying the 25 watts 
of power).  Now, your head unit has what is called a "pre-amp"  this is the 
tiny amplifier that directly amplifies the signal from the electronic laser 
reader in your CD player.  This low-level signal then exits the head through 
the RCA's and travels to your external Alpine amp where the heavy duty 
amp'ing is done.  If the RCA's are not used, and you power your speakers 
directly from the head's 25 watts, then something different occurrs.  That 
pre-amp level signal (from the laser reader) goes to a small 25 watt 
amplifier inside the head unit, and is then sent directly to the speakers 
via the speaker wires protruding from the back of the head.  Essentially, 
this small internal amp would take the place of an external 
amplifier.....unless you opt for the extra power of an outboard amp.  Now, 
many amps have inputs of the same type as the outputs on your head.  Many 
amps have both RCA pre-amp level inputs as well as higher level speaker 
inputs (these high-level inputs are included on some amps to accomodate 
those heads that don't have RCA outputs).  There are a number of ways that 
you can confugure this set up. 

1) you can use only the 25 watts supplied by the head (bad idea if you have 
an amp).

2) you can feed the RCA's to your Alpine and use it alone to power your 
speakers, and leave the speaker lines from your head unused.

3) you can use the Alpine to power fronts, and head unit to power the rears 
(this will probably destroy any front/rear fader capabilities that you have).

To answer your question.  No.  There is no synergy gained by the 25 watts 
going from the head to the amp.  If you are not already using the pre-amp 
RCA outputs from your head to feed the signal to your Alpine, *then you 
should be* (the RCA outs will provide a cleaner signal to the amp).  If you 
are using the speaker wire outputs from your head to feed the amp, then you 
should switch to the RCA's.  If it is indeed the 25 watt lines feeding your 
amp, then this power is merely wasted into heat by voltage-reducing 
resistors within your Alpine before the Alpine ever does its amp'ing duties. 
 Use the RCA outputs and inputs (provided you have them) because if you use 
the high-level lines then you are effectively taking any imperfictions in 
the head's amp and re-amplifying them with the Alpine.

About those Pioneer's, you are probably right about the sun.  Most old 
speakers are made of paper (rather than today's modern plastics) which will 
easily dry-rot and deteriorate in the torture of the sun/temperature even 
though they will continue to operate.  If they still work, fine, but you may 
want to compare the sound with them disconnected.  They may actually be 
negatively contributing to the surely better sounds eminating from the BA's. 
 It is not "mandatory" that you have rear speakers. Just compare, and see 
what *you* like better.

Hope this helped.  Let me know if you have more concerns.

Andy, 
 
 
I am interested in a clean sounding system with minimal, nay zero cutting
in my car, so I've  
resigned myself to stock speackers (4x6's, 5.25's).  I'm putting an amp
under the front seat (I want to  
preserve under-the-hood space), and so have given up on a sub. 
 
Yesterday, you said: 
 
> I have seen successful and attractive sub installs in 911's in the front

If you put the sub in the front trunk, do you need to cut any holes to let
the sound pass? 
 
The rear deck is not an option for me due to theft & driver visibility
constraints. 
 
Below the rear seat is intriguing.  How much work is involved? 
 
 
 
Thanks in advance, 
 
Tom 
 
 
 
PS I have a Kenwood 10-disc CD changer for sale if anybody's interested. 
It'd fit great in the trunk!  (I now have a CD playing head unit. . .)

It's good that you pull your head all the time, too many people don't.  Why 
give theives what they want? I understand how you want to keep from having 
an aftermarket speaker sticking out of your doors.  If you can't fit them 
into the stock holes then you must either enlargen the stock holes (make 
sure that the depth of the speakers will fit also) or custom mount the new 
drivers elsewhere on the door.  There are ways to disguise a Quart logo 
grill from standing out.  Some people build custom grill panels and cover 
them with grill cloth to hide the speakers.  There are many possibilities in 
that department.  Unfortunately, I do not currently work for any 
installation shop.  Rather, I am a full time student at Virginia Tech.  I 
have, however, acquired Mobile Electronics Installer certification 
recognized by the EIA (Electronic Industries Association), and I have been 
an audiophile  for many years and involved in car stereo since before I 
could drive.  I have also successfully run my own mobile auto detailing 
business, which is where my earlier knowledge regarding auto refinishing 
stems from.  I have been to many shops in the NOVA area, some good, some 
terrible.  I have had good results in dealing with Myer Emco, and I am 
friends with several installers in the area.  Even though you can't exactly 
"stop by", I am willing to give any advice or opinions that you might want.

Well Colin, there are some different options you may consider.  Obviously, 
the Bazooka's or simmilar tubes are an option.  In *my* opinion (and not 
necessarily everyone's opinion) I dislike the sound of most tubes, as well 
as their mounting schemes.  You can mount them in the hatch, but they must 
be secured somehow (straps, screws, etc) to prevent rolling around.    IMHO 
they often provide poor sound quality with high levels of distortion in 
comparison to a simmilar dedicated sub-box and amplifier.  They are, 
however, quite cost effective when you need bass in your car *right now*.  
As an alternative I would suggest a sub-box and amp combo suited to your 
car.  This box could be sized to fit in your shallow hatch space, and still 
leave *some* storage space.  A sub-box can be custom built by an installer, 
or as a medium-level DIY project, or you can purchase one of the many 
prefabricated sub-boxes.  The best advice is to go to a local stereo 
shop/electronics chain store and carefully listen to each sub with different 
kinds of *your* music and decide which sounds best to *YOU* while fitting 
your needs/budget.  Go see what's out there, but a good starting point for 
your car might be any set-up including a single or dual 8" or 10" sub.  As 
far as mounting goes, it doesn't matter where you put it in the car.  Bass 
frequencies are considered to be non-directional (directionality decreases 
as frequency decreases).  This means that you don't have to be facing a sub 
to hear all of its output.  You will hear it just the same in the hatch as 
if it were in your lap.  Higher frequencies, on the other hand, are 
increasingly directional which is why smaller drivers must be mounted close 
to and facing your ears for best performance.  About those 4x6's, I will not 
say which is the *BEST* brand to buy because that is far too controversial.  
Everyone has different listening tastes, and different music selections.  I 
will say, however, that I have personally had good results with Infinity 
drivers, and many people regard them very highly.  There are many other very 
good brands on the market also, so don't limit yourself to only considering 
one brand.  As before, the best thing to do is to do some careful listening 
for yourself, and decide what *you* like.  Most of the speakers in that size 
range have simmilar power handling ratings, so 30-40 watts    should be 
about right.

Good Luck!  Let me know of any other concerns.

Sounds like you have a good start on the "first stage" of your system.  Is 
it a DIY system?  If not, what shop did the work?  Everything you have so 
far is right on target.  I am myself a big fan of JL Audio subwoofers.  
IMHO, JL's are very good drivers for the money, and I plan on upgrading to a 
pair sometime soon.  You said your box is a "dual ported" design.  This 
could be interpreted several ways, but I assume you mean it is composed of  
two divided chambers in one box, each ported.  You have also made a good 
choice among amps, IMHO.  PPI's are great performers!  I assume you have the 
model APA-200 (100 x 2) that is powering your pair of subs.  I don't know 
how you have you amp configured (wired up) but I will assume you have one 
channel powering each 10".  Did you know your amp is bridgeable?  If you 
aren't doing so already, you can reconfigure your set-up so that your Sedona 
will feed both of your 10's in parallel, effectively boosting your amp's 
output to 320 x 1 into 4 ohms!  Funny thing, I'm also a fan of Quart.  They 
should make for a pretty good front stage.  Unfortunately I have never 
opened up a 928's door panel, but many cars work in the same way.   It is 
generally not that difficult of a procedure on many Japanese and German 
cars.  Just look around for how it is fastened to the door if you don't have 
the appropriate repair manual.  There are usually screws attaching map 
pockets, arm rests, and window cranks (if you have any of these) that may be 
hidden by screw covers.  Once all screws/bolts are removed, there are clips 
around the perimeter of the panel which must *carefully* be removed in order 
to reuse them.  A tool called a panel popper is used to do this, but 
sometimes you can *gently* pop the clips one at a time with your hands or a 
flat head screwdriver.  Once all fasteners are detached the panel can be 
lifted straight up off of the window sill.  If you get the panel off, just 
use a ruler and measure all three dimensions of the stock speakers (L x W x 
D).  If they are not the same size you want to replace them with, an 
installer with the right tools can often custom mount a larger driver into 
the stock location with a little cutting.  Another option is to attach 
aftermarket or custom built "speaker pods" to the outer part of the door 
panel, although you will lose that totally stock look.

Hope this helps.  Good Luck!  Let me know how it goes.

Forgive me if this has already been covered or is too far off the topic;

Anyway...

Unless you have a limited-slip differential (or a locker), you shouldn't 
install a rear sway bar.

In a corner, the bar transfers weight from the inside wheel to the 
outside wheel.  If you're running an open differential, this is exactly 
what you DON'T want; rear sway bars, if used at all, should be the 
lightest you can find.

You're in luck.  The San Diego Region of the PCA is about to hold its 
annual autocross school.  Naturally, I don't have any copies of the 
newsletter here, but I remember that it's sometime this month.  You 
can, I'm sure, get all the details by calling the region's Info-Line 
(619 944-3869).

I've done the school in previous years; here's how it works:  Friday 
is a 2-3 hour "chalk talk".  Saturday is all-day instruction (with a 
break for lunch), with a half-dozen or so "stations" through which you 
rotate: skid-pad (speaking of rotating...), slalom, braking, a 
mini-autocross course, etc.  Sunday is a "real" autocross; it's the 
second or third one of the Winter season down here, and all the 
regulars'll be there, along with the students from the day before.  
You'll be paired with an instructor who'll ride as your passenger.

If you don't have one, a helmet will be provided.  Other than that, you 
don't need any special equipment, although your car will have to pass 
the usual tech inspection (wheel bearings, brake fluid reservoir, 
battery tie-down, tire wear, throttle-return springs, etc.).

The best part is that the whole thing -- including the entry fee for 
Sunday's autocross -- costs only $90.

Oh... You probably have to be a PCA member.  If you're not, you should 
be, and I'm sure they'll be happy to sign you up.

P.S.  Maybe I should have signed up for the class BEFORE I posted

Subject: 911 or MR2


My wife has a '91 MR2 Turbo, and while my seat time with it has been 
somewhat limited, I can offer the following input.  Yes, the car is tail 
happy, particularly under trailing throttle, but not nearly as much so as my 
'78 930, and while the turbo lag is quite a bit less than the 930 (w/ K27), 
it is still definitely present.  It is small too, but if you're under 6'3", 
you should be ok.  And you can also put all four tires in the passenger 
compartment (they won't fit any place else) when you need to get your 
gumballs to the autocross or your snow tires mounted.  Reliability has been 
good for 90k miles with the exception of the front calipers, which seem to 
last only about 40k.  It is also a noisy car, with the motor directly behind 
your head (and it doesn't sound nearly as sweet as a 911 motor).  It creaks 
a bit too, but that may have something to do with those occasions when it 
has met with solid objects.  Fit and finish on her car seems to be pretty 
good as well, though a couple of minor pieces have come loose.  Controls are 
definitely more modern on the MR2 (though I think I prefer the 930's 
instruments) and the HVAC works much better.  On the styling front, that is 
obviously a personal thing, but the 911 is definitely more unique.  Anyway, 
I like them both, and no matter which one your friend goes with, he can play 
"hide the motor".

the main reason I enjoy the 24 Hour is watching the 911s, 993s, and 968s.
And there will still be plenty of them!  

I must admit to the occasional Walter Mitty daydream of being asked to run
across the street and get my 911 to help out one of the teams.  So you see
I do have to be there, just in case...

But if anyone else is there today I will be probably the only person there
with a tie on (will have to run back to work) but probably not the only one
drifting off to the occasional daydream.

Subject: 944 Oil Scum consensus

Hello All;

Thanks to all the Porschephiles that responded to my question about yellowish 
scum in the oil filler cap of my 951.  The general consensus seems to be that 
this is somewhat normal in the colder winter months, especially if the car is 
not driven long enough to thoroughly heat the oil.  The scum is caused by water 
vapor trying to escape the oil reservior.  As long as the scum does not appear 
on the dipstick things are probably OK.

If the scum starts to form on the dispstick (i.e. in the oil reservior), this 
may be the sign of bad things ($$$).  Possibilities are leaking head gasket or 
failure of the oil cooler seals.  There is a Porsche technical bulletin on the 
leaking oil cooler seals which covers replacing the seals AND the lower rod 
bearings.  If one suspects these types of failures there are other places to 
check.  Look for oil in the coolant bottle in the form of a brownish film or the 
smell of coolant in the exhaust.  If you are still unsure, just ask the list.  
This list may be the single largest collection of Porsche knowledge outside of 
Germany.  Thanks again.

I once was discussing the 85/1 (ie old) versus 85/2 (ie new) systems of

He said, uncategorically, that the 2 systems are quite incompatible. So

Larry is a sometimes pfiles member. Maybe he'll see this and reply with

Subject: Re: 911 sub placement

Tom,

Althouth it is usually *difficult* to mount a sub in a 911, it *can* be 
done.  Perhaps I should point out that most of the cars I have seen that I 
reffered to earlier were professionally prepared, competition level ( yes, 
we stereo nuts *do* have an international sanctioning body(s) to see who has 
the best sounding system) cars that involved considerable time, cost, and 
effort.  Don't get discouraged, however, because it *can* be done.  It is 
possible to mount a sub(s) in the trunk of a 911, and you will still hear 
most of the output eminating from it while in the drivers seat.  What we 
call a "duct" (some sort of open passage way(s) from the trunk to the 
passenger compartment) can be used to allow more of the sound to reach the 
passengers un-muffled.  DO NOT, however, confuse a "duct" with a 
"tuned-port" found on the common "ported" (also called bass-reflex) sub-box 
enclosures.  It is not mandatory to go cutting large holes in a precious 
P-car to allow more bass in (in fact I would discourage cutting up such 
cars).  If you have some free time, find a friend or a shop willing to let 
you borrow his/her removable sub-box.  Place the box in your trunk, close 
the hood, play some appropriate music, sit in the front seat, and carefully 
listen to the level of bass.  Then decide for yourself if what you hear is 
what *you* want.  Don't eliminate the rear deck too quickly.  Although it 
*may* involve considerable custom work (read: expensive), a professional can 
mount subs on your rear deck in such a way that the stock appearance is 
maintained and thereby detering any would be thieves or interfering with 
driver visibility.  In reference to the area below the rear seats, I once 
saw a 911 (1984) with two 10" subs mounted there.  Once again, this was a 
professional's car, it involved an aftermarket fiberglass enclosure 
specifically designed for that space in a 911, and it was painstaikingly 
installed.  Done correctly, however, such a job proved to be inconspicous, 
effective, and I am sure it performed well.  I caution you, however, that 
this is not a task I would recommend for a DIY'er without extensive 
experience in all the above areas.  *BUT* if you have the bucks, and this 
sounds like a good idea to you, find a ruputable local pro-installer who can 
do the work.  Sub's provide an important part of the audible spectrum, and 
they are essential to any high-end stereo system, but you must decide what 
you are willing to compromise to get good bass in your ride.

Subject: Re: hey neighbor-- Head units

Starr (is that your correct name)?

Sounds like you have a pretty good idea on what you want out of your system. 
 Call me ignorant, but I really don't know what a "mini cooper" is, but that 
is kindof irrelevant.  In regard to "RDS", I probably know what this is, but 
I can't seem to remember what the acronym stands for.  Could you clarify?  
Also, just for your information, "DPS" is more commonly reffered to industry 
wide as "DSP" which stands for *Digital Signal Processing*.  I am not sure 
what you mean by "slop it into my Carrera", but I presume you want a single 
head that is easily transferrable from one car to another.  If so, then that 
is not an exteremely easy task because head-units are wired directly into 
the cars electrical system.  One method, however, is to buy one of the 
"removable type units" which comes with a sleeve into which it slides.  The 
sleeve is permanently mounted and wired to the dash, and the head unit 
slides into the sleeve.  An electrical connector on the back of the head 
engages another connector on the sleeve when you slide the unit in.  This 
feature is intended as a security device allowing you to remove the stereo 
from the car while parked.  It can, however, be used between two cars.  You 
must somehow purchase (not an easy thing to do) an extra sleeve of the exact 
same type included with your particular model of head.  Mount one sleeve 
into each car, and wire it into place.  Then, you can easily transfer the 
head from one sleeve to another in different cars.
Unless you are looking for truly high-end sounds in your car(s) then the 
head and "gaggle" of speaker you suggest should be adequate.  An amp will 
not be required, but it can improve performance.  For four moderately sized 
speakers, however, a good high-power, 4 channel, head unit should be able to 
fill your expectations.

Let me know if you have more concerns.

The 944 FAQ sounds like it would bve a great idea!  I am willing to help you. I
have collected
many, many articles, brochures etc. I own a '86 944 turbo and do most of the

not a professional mechanic, but could help from a novice standpoint. Let me

As I said I have a very large literature collection, specializing in the 944/968
series

Here are some ideas:

I think the FAQ should include a long term test section. With the help of other
list members,
I am sure we could compile a very comprehensive owners report.

Another section could include tool sources, and a mail order parts supplier
list,
with comments and sugestions.


Tires, wheels and shocks/springs could be added to the performance section along
with lubricants and fuel.

Average used and resale prices could be included; updated on a regular basis.

Would be glad to help.

Subject: Speakers for P-cars

          Greetings,

          At the risk of turning this list into "Stereophiles@tta.com"
          I thought I'd throw out a few comments.

          First:  To those interrested in the 914 subwoofer box
          design, I will fire up the old computer this weekend and try
          to find where I put the design.  I'll post it to the list
          within two weeks.

          Regarding car speakers in general:
          Take exception to anyone who calls a 6.5" woofer a
          "subwoofer."  I guess in the sense that it will make lower
          bass than a OEM 4" dash speaker, it deserves the "sub"
          moniker but in general, subs are speakers designed to put
          out reasonable bass below 100 Hz.  Bass volume is related to
          the amount of displaced volume from the woofer cone.  While
          it is quite possible for a 6.5" to put out 20Hz, the throw
          of the woofer would have to be quite large to put out decent
          volume.  Even a box with an 8" woofer is pushing it.

          For any of the hobbists out there who may be looking for
          good sound on a budget,  I would strongly suggest that you
          get a hold of a speaker driver catalog (from Madisound,
          Meniscus, A&S, etc) and put together your own "separates"
          speaker system.  Making perfect speakers is difficult, but
          making pretty d*mn good speakers is quite possible and
          making speakers that sound better than what you could buy
          for the money is almost guaranteed.  If anyone is
          interested, let me know and I can help you "roll your own."

          (For reference:  I haven't done too much designing recently
          but I am the former owner of "Altair Speaker Design" and did
          alot of undergrad research into electro-acoustic modelling.)

          For those of you not interrested in speakers, I apologize
          for this little diversion....

In the absence of braking, it really depends upon the ratio of the

break free first.

It may just be a question of semantics, but I think it's the *stiffest* end
that breaks loose first.

If you're experiencing "push" then loosen the front bar OR tighten the rear

Hi there
My '87 924s has just developed a rather disturbing rattle in the rear.
It only happens at low revs and in second gear. It sounds like the
gear linkage is hitting the bodywork or something else. In all the
other gears or at speed, no rattle.

Has anyone else experienced this ? Is it trivial, a linkage bush
perhaps or am I in for a serious surprise when I take the car for a

Reuter reported on 1/28/95 that Porsche said it broke even in the first
half of its 1994/95 business year after several years of losses.  Porsche
lost $75 million in the first half of 1993/94 and $79 million a year
earlier. Improved performance was due to stringent cost cutting measures
and the success of the new 911 model. In the six months to the end of
January Porsche had 9,500 new car orders, a rise of 17 percent from a year
earlier.  In calendar 1994, Porsche delivered 18,244 vehicles to dealers
and exporters, up 43 percent from 1993. Deliveries to its key German and
U.S. markets were up 45 percent and 55 percent, respectively, compared with
1993.

Hopefully, Porsche will remain independent.

Bill,

If you take a neutral handling car and stiffen the rear sway bar,
the car will now have oversteer to some degree.

For example, on my '78 911, I adjust my rear sway bar to full soft
for everyday driving. This makes my car handle fairly neutral for
a 911. When I go to an autocross, I set my rear sway bar to full stiff.
This gives me an oversteering beast that does not push in the corners.

>From What I can recall, stiffening up the rear end *REDUCES* the tendency to

        General rule of thumb is:  A bigger/more effective sway bar on one
end of a car will keep the *other* end sticking to the road.  So you use a
rear bar to cut down on *understeer*.
        As I understand it, the bigger bar reduces body roll at the expense
of putting a greater lateral load on the outside tire.  This makes the tire
slip more easily.  It turns out that this effect dominates over the addi-
tional sticking power gained by reducing body roll--on that end.  However,
since the whole chassis is not rolling as much, the tires on the other end
stick better.

>Unless you have a limited-slip differential (or a locker), you shouldn't
>install a rear sway bar.

        I disagree with that.  In general, the factory set the cars up to
handle pretty decently.  If the car comes from the factory with a partic-
ular sway bar, removing it will adversely effect the handling.  Yes, you
can spin your inside rear wheel, but that is pretty unusual for the stock
setup, even while autocrossing.  Besides, the solution to that problem is
to use a bigger front sway bar.
        If your car was originally shipped with a rear bar, I'd consider
re-installing one of the same size.  If you prefer, you can go for an ad-
justable bar (e.g., Weltmeister and others) which will let you change the
effectiveness of the bar.  Then you can diddle things until you get the
handling set up the way you like it.

I have received a recommendation to use Delrin bump stops, and stiffer
springs (stiffer than 150lbs) so far.  I failed to note that I am currently
using DOT street tires - Comp t/a R1.  A very well respected chassis designer/
SCCA natn'l 914-6 racer advised against anything stiffer than than 150 while
using "street" tires ( as opposed to slicks).   He also sounded fearful upon
asking for Delrin bump stops - "why not just use steel?" I was told".
  Having no bump stop "cushion" will take the car from sprung to unsprung in
such an abrupt manner that the handling will suffer severely.  His suggestion
was to put a small spacer behind the existing bump stop thereby limiting the
travel and retaining the "cushion."   Are there any other opinions?

Any UK lister over 40 will give you the answer to that one -

The mini cooper was a rally version of the Austin Mini produced around 
61-65, it won Monte Carlo rally and many others.

It used a 1000/1275 cc pushrod engine around 70 hp

The mini is still made today it is a 4 seat 2 door saloon weighing about 
1200 lb and smaller than any of the current jap micro cars.

They had a cult following in the 60's famous in the film the Italian Job 
where Michael Caine and fellow crooks drive thru the Rome sewers to escape.

probably 90% of all age 40+ UK drivers have owned/driven a mini at some

Subject: ALL Sway Bars (was spinning 911)

     Slight error by Bill: Stiffening the rear of anything will tend to 
     oversteer more.  Anything that DECREASES capability of rear to corner 
     increases oversteer, and consequently increases marginal steering 
     gain, crispness, response, etc. (up to a point)
     
     What causes oversteer (looseness):
     1. Less rear/more front negative camber
     2. Less rear/more front tire pressure or stickiness
     3. More rear/less front spring rate
     4. More rear/less front sway bar stiffness
     5. Less rear/more front aero downforce
     
     Increased rear wheel/tire width helps to balance the 911's very 
     favorable front/rear weight bias, for usually overall benefit.
     
     Cornering force cause roll, which must be resisted by springs and 
     swaybars.  Front and rear contribute to this.  If you increase the 
     rear'r contribution, you cause the outside tire to have a higher load 
     (vertical and cornering).  But coefficient of friction (mu) does not 
     stay constant as load increases, but begins to decrease at higher 
     loads.
     
     Slip angle (difference in tire direction and "flight-path") is caused 
     by this relationship between cornering force and mu.  This is why 
     loading (stressing) the rear more cause higher slip angles, and 
     perceived "looseness".
     
     Conservative cars (68 Chev Impala, and most older cars) have a large 
     front sway bar and no rear.  This cause ponderous understeer, or 
     "push", under almost all conditions.  This mean it would be near 
     imposible to "provoke" into oversteer.  This is relatively safe, but 
     boreing.
     
     Porsches, being specialty cars, are the best "balanced" of all common 
     (ie. except for maybe things even more exotic than porsches) 
     production cars.  This means that the front/rear slip angles are close 
     to equal when high-g cornering.  Therefore, the driver is constantly 
     and naturally monitoring and adjusting the car to keep it in this 
     balanced mode, which is also the fastest mode to go through a corner.  
     
     When Indy cars "push" the front is slipping too much, and the driver 
     is having trouble missing the exit wall.  If he is too "loose", he is 
     constantly trying to enter the turn just slow enough to avoid hitting 
     the wall backwards after the tail suddenly comes around.
     
     Therefore, ballanced handling gives the driver the most control of the 
     car's attitude under the fastest cornering conditions.  One problem in 
     race cars is keeping it ballanced as fuel load, tires and track 
     change.
     
     This balance doesn't have to be (and won't ever be) perfect, but 
     should be close enough to allow the driver to finish balancing by his 
     active control.  BTW, autox cars can sometimes afford to be much 
     looser than road racers or street cars because of sometimes very tight 
     (small) courses and no consequenses for spinning except losing the 
     run.
     
     All this is very interesting to play with on the autox course if you 
     have opportunity.  In general, though, things should always be changed 
     in fairly conservative and balanced (front/rear) manner, keeping in 
     mind the cost/benefit of mods, and whether there actally needs to be 
     any change. Porches are the least of all cars to need any changes.  My 
     74 914 SE is stock except for gas shocks and lowering the front to 
     where it should have been, and nothing needs to be changed, even the 
     so-called "weak" stock rear springs.
     
     I accept no responsiblity for the (mis)use of this info.  Have fun.

Subject: sway bars and over/under steer


All this airiation assumes you are driving on a flat road!

sway bars try to make independant wheels work like de dion suspensions ie 
keep both wheels parallel (or at a constant ride height)

strong sway bars work against you on uneven bumps, as they don't allow the 
wheels to follow the ground contours.

get going fast thru a curve and hit a bump with one wheel, and your hefty
sway bars will do their best to reduce your contact patch on the other 
wheel close to zero - if thats the outside wheel say goodnight.

Subject: re; Missing Sway bars, when did Galvanizing start

 re; Missing sway bars and When did Galavanizing start (or, the word according
     to Pano...)

 1.   When did Galvanizing start; the November '75 issue of Pano
    introduces Galvanizing in a 2-page article, saying that '76 911s will
    start to use hot-galvanizing, all areas except the roof. Thickness
    is 10 microns everywhere, except for 20 microns around vulnerable
    areas like the rockers and 50u thick around the rear torsion bar.
    Europe will now be offered a 6-year body rust warranty, Pano wonders
    if the US will also be offered the same.
      Regarding incidental use anywheres else, the article only states
    other non-galvanic protection schemes used since '73, including
    corrosion-free exhaust, undercoated gas tank and increased use of
    aluminum. Makes me think there was -no- galvanizing before this.
      Coincidentally, this is the same issue that introduces a newfangled
    version of the 911 with a turbocharger.... 2514 pounds and 78 hp/liter.

 2. Does missing sway bar increase of decrease oversteer:

       According to the "other" Porsche god (Allan Caldwell...sorry Bruce,
    bumping up HP is interesting but getting my windshield wipers working
    is -compelling-!) in the November '92 issue of pano (A Review of
    Suspension Basics, an 8-page article) there is a table on page 20.
    Summarized;

     To increase oversteer or lessen understeer;
        Lower front spring rate,higher rear spring rate, lower spring rate
      of front sway bar, higher spring rate rear sway bar, weight distribution
      rearward, front shocks softer/rear shocks firmer, front wheel camber
      more negative, rear wheel camber more positive, front tires narrower,
      rear tires wider, front tire pressure higher, rear tire pressure less,
      front track wider, rear track narrower, front spoiler larger, rear
      spoiler smaller (or less angle).

    To increase understeer of lessen oversteer; do the opposite of above.
     Or buy a 928. 

      Since the only competitive driving I do is to beat an empty fuel
     gauge, I can't dispute Mr. Caldwell...the rest I'll leave up to
     you mechanical engineers to explain !

While I was at Weissach a bare-metal Targa shell would occasionally be on

The Deutsches Museum also has (or at least had in 83) a stainless steel

My boss recently bought himself a new Porsche and likes it alot, except for
one problem he's having with an odor. He frequently smells the odor of
rotten eggs inside the car, evidentely arising from the catalytic
converter. But why should the odor be so pervasive within the car? 
It hardly seems normal. The dealer says its from exhaust which sometimes
gets recirculated within the car when the car's ventilation system brings
in outside air. How could this be? The car would be leaving its exhaust
behind as it travelled forward. Anyway, he's very concerned over this
problem and wants a better explanation and resolution to this problem that
Porsche has thusfar offered. 
Anybody out there who can comment on this?

How recently is recently, and how often does he drive the car?  Several times
I've ridden in new cars and gotten an unpleasant whiff (scorched wallet, I
figured) which turned out to be an undercoating which got sprayed on the
exhaust manifold and/or catalytic converter.  One good road trip should take
care of that.  If he's taken it on some 2+ hour rides, though, then it's
probably something else.  What model Porsche is it?  If it's a 993, then I
guess it's barely conceivable that exhaust could drift up the back and into
the vent above the rear window when the car's stopped, but I really can't see
it getting sucked in as fresh air, unless there's a problem with his heat
exchangers.

Subject: Swaybars and LSD

IMHO, this swaybar setting thread is going to end up causing some problems
for folks who don't read between the lines.

First off, bar settings used for autocrossing rarely convert directly to
bar setting for the track. Low speed understeer almost always becomes high
speed *oversteer* on the track. If you adjust your car for neutral steering
on an autox course and then take it to the track, you will likely
experience substantial oversteer at the first highspeed corner you come to.

Secondly, the words Locker and LSD are *not* interchangeable. Lockers do
exactly that...They lock the rear differential so that both driven wheels
turn at the same speed regardless of conditions.  LSD units allow for
"slippage" between the two driven wheels, while still supplying power to
both. When entering a turn, a locker requires a completely different
driving technique than does an LSD. (If you've ever driven an ATV you
already know about Lockers) And both require a different technique than a
standard differential. (We're talking track driving here,)

Lastly, rear swaybars really do work best on cars equipped with an LSD or
locker because, as the cornering load increases, the loaded end of the
swaybar tries to pick up the unweighted wheel. In a corner, on a car
*without* LSD, the lifting of a driven wheel is the same thing as lifting
off the throttle...You spin.

>As I understand it, the bigger bar reduces body roll at the expense

I haven't read the rest of this thread, but scanned this message and
thought I might correct it slightly.

You're almost right, but it's not a question of body roll.  Roll is not so
much the issue, except inasmuch as it moves the car's centre of
gravity, roll centre, and otherwise changes the suspension geometry.
These are really second-order issues in the context of this thread.

The first-order thing is weight transfer.  The stiffer end (ie, stiffer bar)
transfers less weight from the inside tire and to the outside tire.  There
is not a linear relationship between vertical force on a tire (weight)
and its ability to generate a side force (cornering force).  In other
words, the simple linear equation they taught us in secondary school
is not right.

So, because of this non-linearity, when weight is transferred, the outside
tire can do less marginal "work."  And that is why the stiffer end, with
comparatively more weight tranfer, will have a larger slip angle.  And
slip angles are what over/understeer is all about.

Hope this helps (and hope I have it right).  Bottom line is that it's mostly
about weight transfer rather than body roll.

Have your boss do one easy check first.  Next time he smells this odor, have
him open the front bonnet.  If the smell is strong, look to see if the battery
vent is blowing fumes.

Not long ago I lost my alternator and replaced it with a rebuilt.  The rebuilt
had a bad voltage regulator ... (caused lots of damage) ... One symptom was
this rotton egg odor.  The alternator was overcharging my battery.  As
it boiled, the sulfur fumes were vented into the bonnet area and came into the
cabin area thru the dash vents.

Anyway, this is easy to check if there is some uncertainty about the CAT
explanation.

Subject: Race 914 Rear Suspension


RE: to the guy with the 914.

I agree with Stan. My experience with some IMSA 914/6s was that a 
minimum of 250 pound springs were required. I personally would be 
more worried that the trailing arms coming into contact with the 
part of the engine shroud that hangs down from the body.

For those of you who aren't familiar with this, the body CAN contact
the trailing arm under severe cornering conditions with wider tires
and a low spring rate. This results in some unusual handling 
characteristics at higher speeds. It also can bend trailing arms at 
the point of contact, resulting in some interesting camber gains that
cannot be adjusted out (replacement of the arms is necessary).

If you start using wide wheels and sticky tires, have the rear arms 
reinforced with extra metal. Automotion sells a fair kit for doing the
arms. You may also consider large (turbo) inside CV joints on your
half-shafts, if you are using real 914/6 arms.

For learning car control, at or near the limit (e.g. pushing until there
is a relatively high probability of a spin), I would strongly suggest
autocrossing, as opposed to drivers education at a racetrack. A spin
at an autocross might embarass you, and might even put a black mark
on your car from a cone, which you can rub off. A spin at a racetrack,
where speeds are typically significantly higher and you run out of smooth
asphault much sooner, may result in either ad-hoc barrier crash testing
or rollover testing, both of which are more than embarassing. The
difference is how you approach (or should approach) the two. With
drivers Ed. on a racetrack, you tend to creep up on ultimate cornering
speeds very gradually, always trying hard to make sure you never
exceed your skill level and spin, due to the consequences. You have
many, many laps (on the order of 30-100 a day x many days on the same
track) to learn. In autocrossing, the risk of overcooking it is
relatively small, so you can afford to get closer to the edge quickly,
just to see where the edge really is (for your level of driving skill,
that day). You also typically have many fewer runs at an autocross,
on that particular course. If both autocrosses and racetrack drivers
schools are available, try both, keeping the above perspective in mind.
The real key is to get as much seat time as you can.

I agree with Steve that an autocross school is good, but you can learn a
lot by just going out and trying it. Even finding a large empty parking 
lot (preferably without poles) and experimenting can be a big help, 
combined with question/answer sessions on why certian things happened,
or what you should try instead. In case it is not obvious, some parking
lot owners will have more trouble with your doing this than others.

Subject: Fuel gauge sender


Does anyone know what kind of wire is used in the
fuel tank level sender for the early 911's?  It's
apparently a fine, resistance wire.  Mine, which is
23 years old, is worn to such an extent that it is
no longer smooth and slippery so the float hangs
up at certain spots.  You have to tap the sender with
a hammer to free it and get a correct reading.

Replacing the wire ought to be a snap.  

I could measure it's resistance and try to find some, but 
maybe someone has already gone through this and knows
what I need.

Tom has already made the obligatory comment about
groan vs. grown. What are these, homonyms?

Sounds like the power steering pump belt is slipping. The belt
is either old and hard or loose. It is easy to replace/tighten,
except the front of the car has to be put on jack stands and
the under pan has to be removed. It has to be done from
underneath (unless you have 4 foot long arms with half
a dozen joints apiece). A pair of 13mm (or is it 10mm,
I forget) flare nut wrenches also helps to loosen and tighten
the turnbuckle. Use proper fitting wrenches rather than pliers
else you will mash the nuts (to say nothing of your knuckles.
But what fun is working on a car without shedding a little blood!?).

BTW, thanks Jim and George for the help with my ignition

My wife has one, too, and I have slightly different impressions of the 
car:

The MR2's turbo lag is quite a bit easier to handle than a 930's; the 
turbo kicks in at a much lower RPM, and my wife has no problems keeping 
it on boost.

I can't really complain about the size issue (except to say that I'm 
5'10", and my hair brushes the roof unless I recline the seat a bit), 
since my car's a 914-6.  The MR2 has a lot more interior room than my 
914, although trunk space is considerably less.

Compared to the RS motor in my car, the MR2's engine is silent.  John 
didn't mention this, but the MR2s come with just about the best factory 
sound system on the planet.  If the whine of the turbo ever bothers you, 
you can just crank up the stereo.

I've never heard any creaks or rattles in my wife's car.  Build quality 
is excellent; it's a Toyota, after all.

I like them both, too.  Too bad the only exterior difference between the 
MR2 Turbo and the normally-aspirated car is the raised engine-lid 
louvers; Porsche really hit the mark with the Turbo whale tails.

I guess I'm more fanatical about safety than most, but to me, this is a

rollcage.  I can tap it with my helmet, but only if I really stretch.  
What's the likelihood of my getting injured in a crash?"

You've got a fast car.  If the tire ever does rub, it's going to be 
while you're travelling at high speed.  I don't know about you, but the 
idea of cutting a highly-loaded tire at speed scares the hell out of me.

Replacing the bump stops with something incompressible will keep the 
tire from rubbing, but you're likely to be extremely displeased by the 
results of hitting THOSE bump stops.  If it were me, I'd either:
a) get new rim halves for those BBS wheels and change the offset, or
b) mod the fenders.

You're right, Dave... My comment applies to cars that are already

Matt:

An open differential sends all the engine's torque to the wheel that's 
most lightly-loaded; this is why, when yuo used to do burnouts in your 
mom's station wagon, you left only one black streak on the road.

A limited-slip differential sends the torque to the tire that's most 
heavily-loaded.

If you're running an open diff and are in a corner, and the inside wheel 
lifts, all the evailable torque will go toward spinning that wheel, 
leaving none for the outside wheel that's still planted firmly planted 
on the track.  With a limited-slip, the outside wheel continues to be 
driven even if the inside wheel is spinning.

Subject: 944 Motronics

The 1983 through 1985 944's used a Bosch 1.1 version Motronic(Registered name
for any of Bosch's lawyers out there.) In mid-1985, with the '85/2 cars, they
Porsche switched to the 1.2 vwrsion. (I think these are the proper
designations. We always just called them Motronic 1 and Motronic 2)

Internally, the systems are entirerly different. The early system used an RCA
processor, and, except in the very latest units, four CMOS memory chips.
Autothority developed a board that replace these four chips, so there is a
performance option there. 

The later systems went to a somewhat more contemporary Intel processor with
EPROM memory.

Surprisingly, I spent some time once going through the wiring diagrams and
parts microfische, and everything matches up except the air flow meter. The
swap should just require that the ECU and air flow meter be matched. All
connectors are interchangeable.

I never tried this on a 944, but did almost the same thing on a 733i BMW by
installing a 3.5 air mass sensor.

FWIW, the cost of an ECU and air flow meter combined would seem to more than
outweigh the difference in price between a chip and the circuit board. Also,
there is no difference in performance between the two options. The additional
4 HP between the '85 and '85/2 came from the exhaust and cam changes.

I believe the two gastesters sold by JC Whitney are made by Gunson, the
same company that makes the colour-tune and Eezi-bleed.  They're CO
meters that you put by the tail pipe of your car to measure the CO. Thus
they can't be used under load unless using a chassis dyno. And if you
have access to a chassis dyno, you probably have access at the same time
to something far more sophisticated to measure the CO.

I'm in the process of getting and installing a lambda sensor and

need more luggage space I can unplug and throw in the
house in a few seconds. 
  Experimenting with postioning it works best firing
into the left rear corner but this leaves it visible
to thiefs, a real problem here in England. The second
best position is right behind the left seat and it is
hidden so that was my choice.
  The non-directional effect of low frequencies is
exaggerated, to get the best results from your
subwoofer system get as much bass as you can from
your door speakers. It may well be worth while, if
less fun, getting the pros in for door speaker
modules. 
  Finally for Porsches bias the sound for the front
seats, people in the back are more concerned stopping
their heads hitting the roof then listening to stereo.

Hi all,

Happy to see the emotions I stirred up in looking for advice from Andy for

I think it's the only "other" car, besides the Range, worthy enough to sit

Hi all.

Does anybody has experience from Solex 40PI venturis.

Currently we are building two ('65 and '66 911's) for historic
race and rally. When we float-test the heads before starting modify
them, we found that the venturi reduces over 15 hp power.

The recommended interval is to keep a belt no longer than 3 years,
independent of mileage.. After that you are subject to cracking and
oxidation. My feeling is that you can't be too careful when evaluating timing
belts. I once had a brand new one break on a 944S. It was less than 2500
miles old and had been installed and re tensioned by a Porsche dealer. With
minimal argument they did all necessary repairs, including reconditioning the
head. (bent valves don't do the valve guides any good at all)
Anyway replace it yesterday.

Sorry if I missed something here..? but partial galvanizing started in *71* AFAIK, the
floors and inner wings (i.e. all the lower body) was the first step. Full
galvanizing started in year '76 according to all refernces I've seen etc (with 
some '75 models also). I suppose the question is what is "full" galvanizing? - I
take it to mean the unitary body (what about doors & bonnet..)

BTW, anybody off to the Le Mans - I got the bumpf eventually from them about booking
etc and was interested to see that they classed the Maison Blanche camping area
as a "LayBy" - something I would agree with actually after seeing the crap facilities
the last two years!

Only one *campsite* (as opposed to 3 or 4 Lay-By's)  was listed (Tribune?) - is this 
the one where the PCA/PCGB BBQ was last year?? Any comments on which is the best 
grandstand?? The ACO seems the best??

Subject: Night Launch (Non-car story)

Last night's Shuttle launch was spectacular. For those of you out of
the area, we had lift-off at 12:22 pm this morning.

It was a beautiful clear night, temperature in the low 60s (It's winter.)

The first thing I saw was what I thought was a very bright street light
on the next street. I was mistaken -- that was the Shuttle.

The light from the rocket engine's flames was bright enought to cast
very sharp shadows on the lawn -- not quite bright enough to read. A
minute or two later you begin to hear the engines -- the Shuttle is 
now only a pinpoint of light in the sky. The sound builds like distant
thunder -- but it continues for about a minute. Things in the house
rattle and you feel the earth shaking.

In terms of acceleration and speed, 10 minutes after liftoff, the
Shuttle is moving over 15,000 mile per hour, is about 20 miles high,
and almost 2,000 miles north of Kennedy Space Center.

I'm a newcomer to this forum and a relatively new Porsche owner.  I have
spent about a year fixing up a
 1984 928S.

There are a few remaining problems that I need 
advice on ... I'm hoping one or more of you may
be able to help me.

(1)  My engine is running slightly hotter than I
would like it to.  I've replaced the fan clutch
(helped a little) and the thermostat (helped some
more), but it still is hotter than I'd like.  
Porsche only makes an 83 degree C (180 degree F) 
thermostat and there is no cross reference to any 
others.  Question: does anyone know of a cooler 
thermostat that would fit or any other alternative? 
Should I attempt to clean the radiator first?

(2)  When I changed the coolant after 9 months of
use, it came out very dark (nearly dark gray) due
to (I think) an oil leak into the coolant.  After 
4 weeks of use and 2,000 miles on the fresh coolant
I drained a cupful and found it to be slightly
darker than the fresh coolant.  I change the oil every 
2 to 3 months and have NEVER noticed any coolant
in it.  Question:  has anyone experienced a similar 
problem before and what do you think might be 
causing it?  Can I live with this and just change the
coolant frequently or am I heading for BIG trouble 
if it's not corrected soon?

(3)  The coolant expansion tank has a coolant level
sender that appears to be malfunctioning.  It has a
very high resistance (several Meg Ohm) when open and
closed, differing only by about 5K Ohm.  After all
the other $$$ I've put into the car, I'm too cheap
to buy a new one.  Any suggestions on how to fix
the darned thing?

(4)  Last and least of all, I think the motor mounts
may need replacing as I notice a vibration when 
the engine runs above 3500-4000 RPM.  Can a slightly
better than average home mechanic change them, is it
worthwhile, or is my car's vibration acceptable?

Thanks in advance for any and all information!!

BTW, There are two good sources for 928 parts here in
Southern California that I recommend:

928 International (800) 634-6117 (new and recycled)
Eurasian Parts Select (800) 824-8814 (new, inexpensive)

   Felix, I don't suppose Edelbrock is a big name in England, but they
  also have an exhaust A/F monitor. Its a self-heated 3-wire oxygen
  sensor (can be mounted anywhere in the exhaust system) and reads out
  on an LED bar display from 12:1 to 15:1 in 1/2 steps. At $130, its
  a very reasonable price.
   MSD (makers of aftermarket ignition boxes) also have a similar unit,
  for $10 more it only has rich/lean LEDs and doesn't appear to be as
  good a value.
     I have the JC Whitney gas analyzer, at $125 it does really help
   when working on idle settings.

Subject: Stan, his 914 & us

I think that the person who suggested that we porschephiles
contribute to buy Stan's 914 racecar for Stan had a very good idea.

Here's my thought:

There are about 500 people on the list (More, I think. I haven't kept the
recent listing of all the names.)

Stan wants $7000 for his car. 

This works out to approx $10-$15 per person.  We have each SURELY gotten this
much value and enjoyment out of pfiles.

SO -- Here's my suggestion:

Each person willing to donate $15 (or more!) should send me an email
off-line, stating his email and willingness to contribute $15. If I get a
critical mass of these I'll let everyone know and the pledgees can actually
make their donations.


		     SEND ME THESE EMAILS BY FEB 11 !!!

If too Few sign up, the idea is a Did Not Start. If Many sign up it's a Go.
If Very Many sign up, the rate per person goes down.

I'll let everyone know the results by Feb 15.

OK???

Subject: RE: Bad motor mounts - what happens?

| From: Armagan Ozkaya  <ozkaya@seas.gwu.edu>
|
| I have a few concerns and would like your help.
|
| 1- I guess my 85.2 944 needs new motor mounts as I feel that the shaking
|    and rattles in steering wheel and hood are becoming more intense.
|    How soon should I have them replaced ?
|    Would they affect anything else in the car if I delay it ?

I am not sure it is good to have things rattling around, but then again
my motor mounts were shot when I bought my car and that did not
seem to cause any collateral damage.

|    Those of you who have them replaced, please write me the cost of it !

I bought the two mounts from Zim's for $126 apiece and put them in myself.
I wouldn't recommend this as your first do-it-yourself repair attempt, but
if you have some mechanical experience, then it is not too hard to do.
Most mechanics will charge 2-3 hours labor and list ($200) each for the
mounts. Figure about $600 for a mechanic to do it for you.

| 2- What is (if any) the most cost-effective way increasing the power
|    (HP) of the car, say 50-60 HP ?

Sell your car and buy an '86 944 turbo. Seriously, this would cost
you about $4000 and there is no way you could get 50-60 more HP
out of your car for that much money. You would either need to add a
turbo to your car or build a very radical engine to get that much HP.
Plus, the 944 turbo has bigger brakes and other reinforcing to handle
the extra HP.

Subject: Re: gear linkage rattle

Colin says, "My '87 924s has just developed a rather disturbing rattle in the
rear. It only happens at low revs and in second gear. It sounds like the gear
linkage is hitting the bodywork or something else. In all the other gears or
at speed, no rattle."

Colin, I would look first for a broken/missing doughnut hanger on your
muffler.  These things have a way of disappearing, and they allow the muffler
to touch part of the bodywork occasionally and at certain RPMs (apparently
depending upon vibration level).  Cheap and easy replacement, if that's the
problem.

Very, very cool car.  The std mini is a rather un-prepossesing car, but
the cooper, with it's tiny little wide tyres (if that makes any sense)
and especially some of the tricked out ones (with extra lights) etc
look really cool.

euro-car had a big section on the mini recently (some sort of inniversary?)

didn't one of the beatles have one ?  One also (not cooper) was in the

I have heard of folks putting an extra engine in the back and running

Hello Porschephiles,
 I'm new to the group and would like some advise on purchasing a 911. I've 
reviewed the last three months archives and have read a few articles/books
highlighting the various yearly model changes. I have a few questions regarding 
maintenance, longevity, and cost. I've been focusing on 84 thru 89 model 
years. 

Realizing that the condition of any car will vary depending on how the
car was driven and how well it was maintained, here are my questions:  
 
 - What kind of mileage can I get out of a 3.2l engine before it requires 
  a rebuild? What is the cost of a rebuild? Does the engine usually need to 
  be totally rebuilt? What is the break down - part vs labor?
 
 - How many miles can I expect to get out of the clutch and what should I 
  expect to pay to have it replaced? What is the break down - parts vs labor?
 
 - Is the reliability of the G50 transmission that mush better than the 
  previous transmission (I noticed a few owners of pre 1987 cars requiring 
  transmission rebuilds)?
  
 - What are some of the other higher cost maintenance items I should be prepared
  to replace or rebuild?

 - I noticed that someone recommended the Motronic (post 83) as more reliable 
  than the CIS, is the LE-jet in the 88/89 as reliable?

 - In my area (Greater Boston) I've notice a few different price levels for 911.
     87's with ~100K miles are listed @ 19,000
     87's with ~60K mile are listed @ 23,000
     88/89's with ~60k are listed @ 26,000+
  Do these prices seem reasonable? If not what should I expect to pay?
  Will the 4K I save buying a high mileage car be quickly spent on a engine rebuild?

 - Does any one know any good sources for used P-cars?

 - What are some of the desirable options I should be looking for?

Thanks in advance.

Since this door has been opened (albeit slightly) . . . 
 
I had a friend in college who's (enlightend) family owned two of these little 
bombs.  In their day the Minis redefined the expression "cornering on rails." 
The Hydroplastic suspension was truly amazing! 
 
My friend's favorite trick was to do ~45-55 mph as he roared up on a car 
stopped for a light.  At the last minute he would use the parking lane to 
negotiate a right turn with nothing more than a quick downshift. 
 
We use to award imaginary points to the drivers of the stationary cars based 
on how long they watched the mini grow ever larger in the rear view mirror 
before turning around with a look of genuine horror as we snicked past with 
inches to spare! 
 
As I recall, the tyres never squelled during any of these exercises, and 
although we occasionally "took to the curbs" I don't believe that we ever bent 
a wheel.

     The show, which I believe is held in late June, is free but not very well

Hello soon-to-be Porschephiliac.
	An '82 924 Turbo is a rather rare model, the last of the 924 
line.  If indeed it is in good condition, then that is a more than 
reasonable price.  I paid $3700 for my '77 non-turbo 924 but it was in 
excellent conditon in all aspects.  The key here is EXCELLENT condition.  
It is definitely not wise, especially with 924s, to "save" money on a 
poor condition car when nicer cars aren't that much more.  If it is in 
good mechanical condition (make sure the turbo works!!!), go for it, you 
won't regret it.  I've had my 924 for 5 years with minimal problems, and 
it will capture your heart like no other car.  I even commute in it daily 
it is so enjoyable.  If you buy it, tell us all about it and we'll do 
what we can to help.  It would be nice to have more 924/924T input on the

My last car - a reliant scimitar used to make the same sort of noise, 
like opening an iron gate with rusty hinges.

It only made the noise when the power steering fluid got very low.

So I suggest you check the fluid level.

There was a time not so long ago when I would have said "don't bother with
the stands, the best view are around the back" for example there is always
lots of action where the cars break for the esses as they pass maison
blanche, or my favorite - arnage.

However every time I go, they seem to have put up yet another new wall to
stop people viewing from the track side - I guess they want to force
people into the stands. 

maison blanche is in my estimation the best camp site - the facilities 
are bad on all of them - at least the ground is grassy and flat.

There is another next to garage blue that is quite reasonable, but it is 
15 minutes walk from the aco.

An important consideration is which has the best exit, I have never camped
inside the cct, but it must be murder getting out after the race. 

We usually camp in maison blanche then move the car to the top of the 
hill by the sports stadium. After the race finishes we do the 20 mins 
walk to the car then go....

Haven't been down for the last two years - the 82 race was rubbish 
puegot ran away with it, so we are looking forward to this year - lets hope 
there is a decent entry.

nearer the time we must set up a meeting spot.

Which reminded me that there was a long discussion some months ago on 
CompuServe which was started by somebody who couldn't keep the neighbors' 
cats off his new car. There were a lot of fine suggestions revolving around 
solutions like shotguns, plugging the car into a 120V outlet (or 240 if 
avail) etc.

Finally someone stated that cats hate mothballs. It so happens that we have 
4 cats here (emphatically, not my doing) who just love hanging around on my 
356 which is covered, and like best the hammock effect of the cover when the 
top is down, which it always is. Not only that, they seem to like doing the 
gross things that cats do on the cover the moment it has been cleaned. What 
retard said cats were clean?

I am happy to announce that the cats are now truly pi**ed at me and glower 
at me each time I encounter them. But they don't do it while lounging on the 
luxury of my car because I attached a few cannisters filled with mothballs 
and with holes punched in them to the cover. No cats. It works!

The shotgun/electric current type of solution is probably less work, but if 
for family reasons there is no open season on cats, the mothballs work great.

This sounds silly, but are you really sure your 928 is running hot?
I notice that my temp gauge goes up significantly when the lights are
on - presumably due to voltage changes somewhere, which affect the
reading, not the actual temperature. The problem is figuring out how
to get a true temperature reading; surely the stuff in the overflow
tank is cool, but it seems to be the only place available to insert a 
thermometer.

As for the coolant level sensor - sounds like you have a choice of
shorting it out or replacing it - might as well go ahead and take
it apart to see what's what - maybe you'll find a cruddy contact.
Let the list know - if yours has failed, can mine be far behind?

- --------------------------------------------------------------------
The reason why I am replying to these items is that I had similar
problems with my 928.  The temperature was always a little high,
especially on a summer day.  I did not have oil in my coolant, but
I had a very slow coolant and oil "seep" from one head gasket.
The price of fixing these "minor irritations" was so high that I
decided to live with it for a while.  Bad mistake.  My engine
overheated instantly one day, the heads warped badly, a pulley on the
front of the engine seized, and I got to ride in a tow truck (again).
I now own a new engine.  Take my advise, if there is any indication
of a blown head gasket, get it fixed.  And do your valves, while
you have it apart.

The engine vibration sounds similar to what I used to experience
at precisely 3100 to 3300 RPM, in any gear, but only when
accelerating.  The problem went away when I got my new engine.
I never asked my mechanic, but perhaps he put in new mounts, or
maybe the new engine sits a little differently.

By the way:  John Lucas, it sounds like you might live in Southern
California.  I, too, shop at 928 International (I think I am their
best customer).  If you indeed live around here, and you want to
get together to commiserate some time, send me Email.

I have noticed the same thing intermittently on a number of 944-series

As a  newcomer to this list, I have been "listening" for about a week and
now overcome my stage fright.
In Europe, I have a  '73 Euro  911 T coupe, no sunroof, with the S package
(ventilated brakes, spoiler, ...)  in pretty good and original condition
until... last year I broke a timing chain.

I took out the engine and took it apart and was very lucky there was not
very much damage (no valves broken etc.) .

At that time I saw a '73 2.7  RS engine for sale  (the REAL one, type 083
with MFI and everything).
I decided to put that in the car, bought  a new fuel pump (my T engine has
Zenith carburettors and the MFI fuel pump is different), serpentine oil
cooler and installed it. The car drives like a blast but would need
stronger (S type) front brakes.

I feel tempted to convert the car to a full RS replica but before starting
to cut the (very nice) bodywork to install flares etc. I would like to hear
some opinions about:
*       is it a good idea and how much is involved?
*       is it better to bring the car back to original condition (remember I
        still have the T engine and it doesn't need a lot of parts)?
*       would it make sense and is it possible to convert it to a 2.4 S using my
        T engine crankcase, new pistons and cyls. and the MFI, cams, crankshaft,
        rods from the RS engine?
I know it sounds stupid to cannibalize an RS engine, but the 2.4S is highly
valued in Europe.

Note that the car is not driven in the US so I don't care about DOT/EPA etc.
Whatever bits and pieces I would need, I would buy here (i.e. US): this is
a great places for Porschefiles! Lots of stuff around and mucho less
expensive.

Carlin,

A little unclear from your description as to the exact problem.  I would
assume that, as a rule, one generally opens a passenger-side door
from the passenger side.

Try the following.  There is a large-headed philips screw in the trailing
edge of the door, which partially retains the door handle mechanism.
If you remove the screw, you can pull the handle out a bit and lubricate
the mechanism.  Use an aerosol lubricant which dries and stays, such
as Wurth HHS 2000, Castle Thrust, or a white lith grease.

Also lubricate the latch mechanism on door trailing side.

Hope this helps.

If I remember correctly, the dash vents in the center only deliver cold air -

Ed,
If your 86 is the same as my  87 (I think the routing is the same even if the
vents are a different size), the only dash slider that effects the heat is the
lower one (red on my car) and it sends heat to the defroster vents when moved
to the right and the floor when moved to the left, both if positioned in the
middle. Heat never comes out of my middle dash vents although a small amount
comes out of the outer dash vents when the red slider is positioned for
defrost (this is from memory so that may be floor instead). The top two
sliders adjust fresh air and fan speed. The middle slider routes fresh air
either up to defrost vents (right) or down to the floor (left), as the red
slider does for the hot air.

Either yours is working properly or both of ours are screwed up. However, I
believe that mine is working the way my owners manual describes.

Subject: Mini Coopers and Roundabouts (i.e. Rotaries)


Text item: Text_1

Ahhhh! Nostalgia.......

FYI there were a number of Mini Variants, the basic Mini, a Mini Cooper and the 
Mini Cooper S. The S eventually came in 998 c.c. 1100 c.c. and 1250 c.c. 
versions, I had an 1100 for a year. If I remember correctly the primary mod for 
the Cooper was a hot cam and twin SUs(more nostalgia!), may be it was bored out 
a bit too. The Cooper S was more extensively modified and had a nitrided crank 
and other goodies added. Apparently for a real Rod you replaced the S cam with a
cooking Cooper cam. Engine work was a snip, you could wheel the body away from 
the engine/sub frame in 15 min. I still have the workshop manual.
The reason I sold it was becauseI was into one of the recently discussed 
roundabouts with a great deal of enthusiasm when I decided I wasn't going to 
make it, and being MG A trained and rear wheel drive conditioned I put the boot 
in some more. Well you know the rest, except that the kerb stones were near as 
high as those 10 in wheels. It didn't roll but when I got home I went searching 
for a rear wheel drive. Got a Cortina GT (couldn't afford the Lotus Cortina) 
this beastie cornered on three wheels but that's another story.

So it's not just my car after all!  I have noticed the temp guage jumping

"hot" top area when I'm in stop and go traffic.  If and when the electric

Volney Spaulding asked about Porsche mechanics in the Bay Area.
 
If others are going to toot their own horn, I'll toot somebody else's.
 
For my money, the absolute best 356 mechanic anywhere is Clark Anderson in
San Jose. You owe it to yourself to talk to him. This won't take as long as
with others in the Bay Area because you don't have to wait for the ego display
to end. And he doesn't charge gold-chainer prices (for gold-plated motors?)
Clark used to be one of the principals at the late lamented Garretson shop,
is the 912 guy on the PCA technical committee (see back of Pano), and is the
brother of the more famous Bruce Anderson but doesn't hold that against him.
Clark has been doing 356s for more than 25 years, and more recently 911/912/
934/935s, including the Garretson cars that went to places like Daytona back
when Porsches were welcome there. He's not known to the general 356 public
because he doesn't have time/ego/writing inclination to attempt a vanity press
effort. He is known and respected by the top people in the 356 hobby.
 
Give him a call at 408-266-3191 and say I sent you.

Subject: Re: gastester

The problem with the garden variety Lambda sensor is the range.  If I remember
the range is limited to about 14.0:1 to 15.0:1.  The original intent of using
these sensors was as switchpoint at the "ideal" A/F ratio of 14.7:1.  They are
not suited to use an analog, linear transducer.  There may be later versions 
that have a wider range, but are probably very expensive

DSWIGER@QNTM.COM

I believe the two gastesters sold by JC Whitney are made by Gunson, the
same company that makes the colour-tune and Eezi-bleed.  They're CO
meters that you put by the tail pipe of your car to measure the CO. Thus
they can't be used under load unless using a chassis dyno. And if you
have access to a chassis dyno, you probably have access at the same time
to something far more sophisticated to measure the CO.

I'm in the process of getting and installing a lambda sensor and
air/fuel ratio monitor to help me tune the twin Weber 40DCOE's on my
non-Porsche.  RPM in Port Orange, FL (occasional Panorama advertiser)
sells such a beast as does TWM Induction in Goleta, CA. My plan is to
monitor the mixture under load and thereby help me find the right
jetting for the current ambient temperature. I'll post again when I have
some further news or experiences.

Subject: Oil Pressure problem 911SC

The following is a post for a collegue who has an '82 911SC.  If anyone has
some advise, please send a response to him directly (I'll be out of town for
a while "Trondheim, Norway" Brrrrrr):

B_Eisenhart@lfhs2.hso.link.com

This problem is in regard to a 1982, 911, SC

I pulled into a parking space at work and rolled up the drivers side window 
(I have power windows so the engine was still running) I heard a loud noise.  
I thought that the window had broken, I rolled it down and then back up and 
it worked OK.  I wasn't sure where the sound came from, the window or the 
engine compartment and I am not sure if the noise has any bearing on the 
problem.

When I started the car to go home I noticed that the oil pressure light was 
on.  I immediately turned off the engine.  I then restarted the car to check 
the oil pressure gauge, thinking that it may just be a light sensor failure.  
This time the oil light remained off and the pressure gauge did indicate 
sufficient oil pressure.  When driving home (approx. 2 miles) I noticed that 
the oil pressure gauge was registering higher than normal oil pressure 
(approx. 5 bar. at about 3000 RPMs and approximately 2.5 bar. at idle 
speed).  Approximately one block from home the oil pressure light came on, at 
the same time the oil pressure gauge was indicating sufficient oil pressure.  
I Immediately shut the engine off and coasted home.  I later pulled the car 
into the garage.  For this short period of time the oil pressure light stayed 
off and the gauge indicated sufficient pressure.  I checked the oil level and 
it was OK.

The next day I noticed that oil was leaking from the oil return tubes, I 
suspect that the oil level in the sump is higher than normal when the engine 
is not running.

I checked the oil pressure regulator valve and it was OK but haven't checked 
the pressure relief valve since it requires the removal of the exhaust 
manifold. 

I would appreciate any ideas where I might begin to look for the problem and 
what to do to fix it.  

Please respond to: B_Eisenhart@lfhs2.hso.link.com

There is risk that the vibration may break or unseal the oil pick-up in
the sump.  Get the mounts fixed right away.  If you suck air, you have a

Agree with Jerry, three years is about as long as you want to carry

Yea, mine does the same thing. Power steering pump. I have been told that
in cold weather the seals shrink enough to let air into the system, and the
groaning it the power steering fluid cavetating (sp?) in the pump. I have
no idea if this causes damage. I try to situate my car so that when I start
it in the morning I don't have to do any low speed turning as my problem
only occurs when the power steering is really working (ie. - at low
speeds). As soon as the car warms up a little it goes away.

Does anyone know if this problem causes damage to the power steering system ???

Subject:  Re: Info on 924 Turbo needed.

$2800 sounds like quite a bargain for a 1982 924 Turbo - check it out
carefully before you buy.  One of the consequences of the (inexplicably) low
resale value of the 924 seems to be that many owners bought them cheaply and
(as a result?) seem to abuse them - only to sell them cheaply when they start
giving problems.  This is a shame because they really are fantastic cars.
 When we were shopping for my brothers 924, we must have seen dozens of cars
 - until we found that 'mythical'  one-responsible-mature-owner car (with
receipts even).  
Anyway - take your time and you will find a good one!
I have a 1980 Turbo (the '82 is significantly better though...) and a 1977
924.
I have had few problems although I'd check for cracked manifolds, oil leaks
(in the myriad oil pipes!), smoking exhaust when the car is at idle and also
when accelerating hard.    
Maybe more importantly is just getting a sense of the car.  Is the
engine/engine compartment clean (can you even see the oil pump and the oil
pan?)?  Does everything work?  

Porsche really radically changed the 924 Turbo in 1981.  Smaller Turbo (yes,
that a GOOD thing!), DITC ignition, higher compression ratio, different
transaxle, changed exhaust manifold (the 1980 leaks a bit...), turbo oil
return 'de-aerator' etc.  The 1982 Turbo also has improved AC/ventilation
system (hence making 'your' car quite a bit more desirable).
The M-471 option package includes 16" wheels, large 928 brakes and stiffer
springs/shocks and anti roll bars - very desirable!.

I hope this car turns out to be good - we need more 924 fans on this list.

the engine as the oil pressure has dropped significantly in the last few 
months.  He has been shopping around and found an '88 turbo S engine at what 
seems to be a reasonable price and has the following questions:

1.  The engine includes everything (with the appropriate DME unit).  Will 
this fit his '86 without any major problems and will he need any other 
components?  I understand the exhaust should connect OK.

2.  If so how much time should he expect for labor and should he go with an 
experienced (expensive) shop with good 951 experience or can it be done by 
his good friend (inexpensive) who is a good mechanic with some limited 951 
work experience?

3.  His current engine has an adjustable cam gear (Autothority).  Will this

Subject: Regarding All Stereo Threads

OK, for the record:

Incase someone didn't notice judging from the recent volume of stereo 
messages, I am new to this list (or any list for that matter).    I have 
slowly been acumulating as much Porsche literature as possible as I eagerly 
anticipate the day that I will own my own shiny Porsche.  You can surely 
understand my excitement in discovering a list for Pfiles only.  It was my 
intention to quietly join the list and gather as much P-car info as possible 
before the long awaited purchase.  After lurking for a while, I attempted to 
offer my knowledge/advice in reference to a car stereo thread.  I have been 
an audiophile for a number of years, and fully intend to acquire the *right* 
to call myself a Porschephile as well.  I have considerable experience in 
the car audio field, and felt that I could offer my knowledge to such a 
thread.  This topic, however, expanded quickly, and I tried to keep up.  I 
in no way want this list to resemble "stereophiles and a few porschephiles 
on the side@tta.com".  I joined the list *specifically* to augment my own 
*Porsche* knowledge.  

I realize that this is demanding considerable bandwidth at present.  I will 
agree that this topic is not directly P-car related, and differs from the 
usual  threads on the list. I do believe, however, that the topic of 
stereo's is indirectly related to most road going Porsche's, otherwise 
Porsche's wouldn't come with factory stereos at all.  The shear volume 
regarding this topic lately will attest to that fact.  It is obviously a 
topic important to a number of sbscribers, and I feel that, aside of race 
cars/auto-x'ers, a good stereo can only make driving in a *great* car more 
enjoyable.  I am truly a fan of both worlds, so why not mix the best of 
both?  To eliminate the problem of excessive bandwidth, I definitely agree 
with others' advice to take this discussion to private e-mail.  I have 
un-thinkingly posted some privately sent threads to the entire list, and for 
that I sincerely apologize.  It will not happen again.  I will continue to 
offer my advice to those who desire it, but I will only post it to the list 
if I feel it is relevant to others, and the sender approves.  It may help to 
include in your note if you wish me to post to the list or individually.

It is my goal for *me* to gain some valueable Porsche information by 
participating in this list.  I hope that Porschephiles and audiophiles can 
get along, and benefit as a whole from each others' knowledge.  

Sincere Thanks for your understanding,

Shame on you George for flaming someone who is obviously a young struggling

Besides maybe he is a tinkerer who enjoys little DIY projects.  And you 
would deprive him of the joy of it...

The Hirschman automatic antenna costs about $130-250, depending on where you 
look so it certainly wouldn't hurt to try to fix it. When mine failed in my 
'84, I took it apart and was able to repair it (don't remember all of the 
details though - it was a broken antenna).  Tony, you didn't say what the 
symptoms are.  If the unit makes noise when you turn the radio on or off 
then you may just have a broken or binding antenna.  These are replaceable 
for about $35 from the mail order places.  There are two antenna types, one 
which has a toothed plastic cable that winds up inside the unit to 
extend/retract it and one that is smooth but may show slight toothlike 
indentations from the drive mechanism. Check which one you have before you 
order.  The replacements come with instructions for installation (pretty 
easy job).

If there is no sound from the motor in the unit, check the connection to the 
radio to see if it is bad (it goes between 0 and 12V to raise and lower).  
The unit itself is in the drivers side wheel well and can be removed pretty 
easily after removing the right front wheel.  The unit can be opened and the 
mechanism is pretty straightforward, a motor, electronics (relay) and a 
takeup spool.  If you can't find any broken wires or figure out how to 
repair it, at least you have done half of the job of replacing it

>If you're experiencing "push" then loosen the front bar OR tighten the rear
>bar...Do just the opposite for oversteer.

OK, another question along this line - my car understeers pretty badly in
the slow corners but is delightfully neutral in the fast ones.  I have 
20mm/18mm F/R sway bars (stock on my car was 16mm front - no rear) and 24.1mm
torsion bars in the rear (in lieu of the 23mm stock ones).  I think
part of my problem may be the 185/70 tires in the front on 6 inch wheels/
205/60 in the rear on 7s (try not to laugh - the tire sizes are a result of
the previous owner).  I plan on replacing the fronts with 195/60s and staying
with 205/60s in the rear.  I think this should mitigate my understeering
condition.  What's the consensus?  Maybe I should play with tire pressures
a little?

Subject: Re: spinning 911s/rear sway bars

One more note in that respect.
When Russell Racing is teaching driving at the limit, that put you in a formul
a ford and disconnect the front sway bar in order to induce the car to
oversteer. That might bew a convenient way to remember. On the topic, Bruce
Anderson also says:
"On a late model 911 (74 through current) that is being modified for
competition use, I recommend that the stardard front sway bar be replaced
with early 911 (through-the-body) style bar with connecting crop links. This
change is necessary because of the more precise control with the drop link
style sway bar, plus the advantage of a wide  selection of replacement bars
available for this style of bar as opposed to almost none for the later style
street bars.

A final thought

Scott Winders writes:

 "For example, on my '78 911, I adjust my rear sway bar to full soft
for everyday driving. This makes my car handle fairly neutral for
a 911. When I go to an autocross, I set my rear sway bar to full stiff.
This gives me an oversteering beast that does not push in the corners."

But be careful,..... that works at an autoX, but on a fast race track at a
major event, it might be...well embarassing. If you don't have a C4, we find
that reducing oversteer helps at fast tracks, where getting through the high
speed kinks is more important than getting into the slow corners quickly.

Hi, Andre.
 
If you have a complete RS engine including the injection pump (I think the
last three digits on the Bosch part number are 019 for a real RS pump), I
would not hesitate to turn it into an RS replica. OK, so it's not a genuine
RS, but you can make it behave pretty much like a real RS. I would not do
this as an investment, I would do it to enjoy the car. I figure a 911 T is
the bottom of the ladder, with only 130 hp, you can only go up from there.
For readers who don't know, the T had 130 hp, the E 165, the S 190, and the
RS 210. That's going to make a BIG performance difference.
 
Second choice of course would be a 2.4 S, again you won't be fooling any
knowledgeable buyers into thinking it's a real S, but you will have an
enjoyable car at much lower expense than the RS. But then, you have the RS
engine, what are you going to do with it? If you sell it, you'll only be
sorry later. I would use it.

I assume everybody means something other than the below-2000 rpm rattle that
is typical of 915 transmissions (911) and whatever type is in the 944?
That's normal and you can't do anything about it. That's why they kept
struggling with rubber vibration dampers (which exploded), went back to
spring dampers, went to other rubber dampers, went to dual-mass flywheels,
etc. It's engine torsional vibration setting up rattles in the trans input
and various other bits. If what you have is NOT this typical rattle, I don't
know.

By your question, you show that you are new to Porschephiles.

This subject was discussed at length two weeks ago, when IMSA decided that
Porsche was sandbagging and imposed airflow restrictions and added weight to
the Porsche entries.

Porsche withdrew, stating that the adjustments to the rules would add four
seconds to each lap.

A fellow out of the Chicago area - Bob White, can probably help settle this

under DOT contract, he was given a bare metal, galvanized P-car to drive -
for about 6 months, as I recall.  This was during the mid '70's (around '77,
I believe).  As I recall, this was a coupe, not Targa - so there must be more
than one of these beasts around.

I further recall reading that partial galvalizing began with the 1976 models,
though it may have only been with specific lower body componenets.  I've not
heard of any earlier cars being tested,  though who the heck am I.

Subject: 924 Turbo

As someone else has just posted, the 1982 924T (aka 931) was the last of
the breed offered in the USA.  I think they were sold for another year in
Italy.  Although the pre-1981 931s may have gotten bad reviews for 
reliability, etc., my '82 931 was (and still is) a delightful car to drive.
It has all of the running gear of the early 944s and will outrun most of
them (no flames, please!).  It is a high maintenance vehicle, requiring
constant attention to the tightness of the turbo assembly bolts, etc.
You can also expect to rebuild the turbo every 20-30K miles because it 
does not have the water-cooled bearings of the 951.  I sold my 931 to a
friend (that's how much faith I had in the car!) last year for $6K.  It was
in perfect shape with no known defect, new everything, including paint.
Why did I sell it?  I could not resist the allure of the Indischrot 928S!
Neither could I justify having two German metal dollar magnets at the same
time.
If you buy the 924T, you will enjoy it, but it will not be inexpensive.
Best regards.

I'll second that. I'm currently investigating how to install a decent

  I had my 924 for 1 year with maximal problems, and it still captured my

John, once, back in the '70s at Road Atlanta, this happened to me.  I was a
spectator at a F5000 race, standing by the fence just upstream of the bridge
 - a notorius spot for crashes as it called for heavy braking at the downhill
end of a VERY fast straight - when David Hobbs sailed into view.  He traveled
the last 200 yards down the hill sideways, accompanied by huge clouds of
red-clay dust and minor body parts, and ended up against the bank just below
me.  When the tow-truck arrived, there was a great commotion among Hobbs and
the crew, and he turned to the fence and asked, "Anyone have any tools?"  My
356SC was parked just behind me, so I turned, got the Porsche tool kit from
under the hood and handed it over to Hobbs.  He used it to remove enough
body-work that the tow truck could hook up to the car, then carefully
returned the tools to the kit and handed it back to me.  Those were the days
when racing was more informal than it is today.  You could wander around the
paddock area, poke among the cars, and talk to the drivers.  It's nice to
remember folks like Hobbs, Peter Gregg, Donohue, Ongais....or, to go back
even farther, Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss!  God, I sound like an

"Is it an all or nothing situation? They work or you replace

Like all machinery, power antennas need occasional maintenance.  Periodically
(every time you wash the car, for example) extend it fully and thoroughly
clean the grime off with something like WD40 and you will ensure that it
operates for many, many years.

When they get gunked up so badly that the motor can't overcome the friction,
they die.  On a dead one, pull all the sections out by hand and clean them.
 Try the switch.  If it still doesn't work, do as George suggests and buy a
new one.

Subject: handling questions/alignment

Mike,
I am no 911 expert but I do have experience on a basically understeering car,
a 951/S. This car with stock suspension is set up to understeer and
understeer it does. However with no other changes I can completely change the
handling characteristics by re aligning the car with a "track alignment". 
The point being that handling is a function of a myriad of variables so
consider all the variables when making changes. For example a little toe out
on my car will turn it into a ill handling SOB on the highway and a car with
great turn in and a bit of oversteer on the track.
Hope I didn't confuse you still further

I've been following this thread with considerable interest.  Suspension
has always been my "thing", but I have quite a lot yet to learn about it.
So it is with humble confusion that I ask, what am I misunderstanding here?

Subject: More on 924s, Don't get BMW!!!

Hello Naresh,
	The reason 924's are said to be so expensive to maintain is 
because of their reputation of having many VW parts.  People are shocked 
that their car mostly consists of Porsche only parts.  I can usally find 
deals on parts, and they really aren't THAT expensive.  OK, for 
specifics.  I have spent about $1200 in five years for my '77 924 during 
which time I have gone from 73K miles to 120K.  This was mostly for 
routine things like shocks, brakes, tires, etc.  My only problems have 
been water pump, $45, and head gasket failure, $50 and two Sundays work 
(or about $200 in mechanics time).  I regularly drive it 15 hours round 
trip to see relatives, and it has NEVER left me stranded.  If you're 
thinking BMW, compare prices for maintenance and repair.  My freind has a 
325e and just rebuilt his engine to the tune of $2100.  By the way, if 
you must get a Bimmer, get an 325i, not a 325e.  Even after the rebuild, 
I can keep up with him, and its a six! (e's are slow).
	About the Turbo.  Take it on a highway and take it up to speed 
in third and you'll FEEL the boost around 3500 RPM if its working.  A 
soft whine is OK, but if its really loud, its probably about to quit.

Good Luck!

I had a similar problem on a Audi 5000 Turbo. The problem got worst as time
went on and I had to replace the entire handle and trigger mechanism to make
the repair complete. I suppose I could have done the repair myself but when
the mechanism failed I couldn't even open the door! It may be a good idea to
take a look at it now while you still have the use of a functional door.

greetings....(this is my first letter to this list)....

I've recently run into a problem with my passenger side door lock on my 944
Cab...The problem has persisted for more than a week now...

The door will unlock if you either pull up on the knob or if you unlock
from the passenger side...so I assume it is just a little sticky or
something...

anyone have any good ideas how to fix this?

Hi Jay,

Thanks for putting up with me and my questions!

I think I'll go for the 924 T if it checks out ok. I'll see it sometime 
next week and I'll let you know how it goes. The price of maintenance 
wasn't as high as I expected, thanks for being so specific! I have two 
more questions for you.

1) Does the timing belt have to changed on the 924T often, if so at what 
intervals?

2) If the Turbo is bad, how much would it cost to rebuild/replace? 
ballpark figure.

If you think of anything else, please let me know.

Thanks again for all of your help,

Subject: 7x16 Fuchs on '71 911

Just wondering if anyone is running 7x16 wheels on their early '70's 911.
I have an opportunity to purchase some locally.  The wheels in question
have 225/60 P7's which are *way* to wide for my 911.  It looks as though
205's on a 16" wheel may be too big also.

My guess is that I should go with 6x16's all around with 195's on the front
and 205's on the back.  That or go with stock 6x15's.  This is my daily
driver, I'm interested in updating the appearance from the stock steel
wheels and a minor handling improvement.

Comments from the list would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: a used 911 checklist

Dear p-philes:

I recently purchased a 1982 911SC Targa.  In the course of my 4 month search,
I put together a checklist to help organize things.  I read a number of 
books that were helpful in the purchase process, including Porsche 911 
Performance Handbook, Illustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide, The Used 911 Story,
and a video "A Porsche 911 & 930 turbo Close-up".  I also read a year's
worth of Porschephiles Archives (boy, did that take some time!) and found
lots of great tips in buying 911's. I think the best tips were "in 
general, buy the latest model you can afford" and "have a (good) mechanic 
do a pre-purchase inspection".   Anyway, I hope this checklist will make life 
easier for some prospective 911 buyer out there. I also look forward to 
comments for improvement from the long-time members of this group.

Peter,

Please notice that I did say "autocross".  When I go to the big track, I
leave the rear at full soft so I don't have a "oversteering beast" that
will find a way to hurt itself or me.  The point of my statement was to
illustrate that stiffening the rear increases oversteer or reduces
understeer, depending on the original condition.

Here are some options:
 - 6x16 all around with 205/55s is a pretty safe bet
 - 7x16 in the rear with a 205/55 *can* fit with some fender lip rolling
 - 7x15 all around with 205/60s (may still require some lip rolling in the
   rear)
 - 7x15 all around with 205/50s front - 225/50s rear (I've seen it done
   although I would not have thought 225s would fit in the rear...)

You'll have more of a problem fitting stuff under the rear flares as the 
fronts are basically the same as SCs/Carreras.  My vote would be to try
to use the 16 inch wheels somehow.

Have a good day!

Subject 71' 911T questions

Because I know I don't know I have been lurking on the side hoping someone else would ask questions that shed light on my problems.

Some background,

In 1961 I bought a 1960 TR3A.  97k miles, one engine and two transmissions later I was married and expecting my first born.  Given the expectant wife could no longer fit in theTR3, I put it in deep storage.  Deep Storage meant digging a hole along side my house removing part of the foundation, and sliding the TR3 down into the cellar. For the next twenty three years, it was fun to watch the expression on peoples faces when they walked into the cellar saw a full size car, with no obvious way for it to be there. 

After the kids graduated from collage I decided to restore the TR3.  I found a guy that knew about restoring TR3's, he also had a beautiful 1971 911T, with 38K miles on it original paint, always stored in the winter, with no obvious rust, just an outrageously beautiful car.  I asked "how much for the 911?"  his answer "not for sale."  During my evaluation of rebuilding the TR3 I reviewed what I wanted in a sports car, and came to the conclusion I wanted a pre 1972 Porsche, but would not be able to find one that fit my requirements.  I made the decision to sell my TR3, and buy a TR3 that was running.  Went back to the TR3 rebuild guy, to see if he would buy my TR3, and sell me one that was running.  Walked into his shop, saw the 911, but did not see anyone else,  looking at the 911 and thinking I was by myself I said out loud "but this is what I really want."  It seemed as though God spoke from the corner of the garage (TR3 rebuild guy), "It's for sale," wife came walking into the garage as He spoke, took one look at the 911 and said "buy the sucker," and I did.  One week after I had the car on the road, I went to a Florist shop to buy the wife flowers, I had spent all my free time on the 911.  There was an older guy who drove an older Volvo standing at the counter.  Staring at the 911 through the shop window he said "beautiful car"  I said "that's why I'm here, I am spending so much time on the car, it may cost me my marriage of 31 years." he said in a low voice "keep the car."

Sorry to bore you folks with idle chit chat.  I get thinking about the 911 and lose all my natural New England conservatism.

Can someone help me with the following questions:

1.	Do I need a CO2 analyzer to keep the car well tuned?  If so where can I buy one, at a reasonable cost that will do the job?

2.	I have not had good results in tuning the car.  I finally broke down and bought a set of factory manuals (worth every cent), reviewing the factory procedures indicates my lack of good results may be because of my amateurish approach to tuning.  The carbs are Zeniths, I want to keep the car original, I have replace the accelerator diaphragms in the carbs.  I have reason to suspect the carbs may need a through cleaning and overhaul however I don't want to "fix something that aint broke".  The car had been in storage for six years and laid up every winter.  When I bought the car I brought it to the local Porsche dealer for an inspection, I thought they did a lousy job, they did not tell me anything that was not obvious.  How do I determine if the carbs need rebuilding or special maintenance?

3.	Major problem is in the range of 700 to 1400 Rpm engine backfires through carbs, and exhaust.  In high range this old cat still has legs, it is very comfortable at 80, will exceed the century mark.  The air cleaner housing (that big black ugly plastic air manifold that sits on top of the velocity stacks) shows signs of melting at cylinders 5 and 6, however that may have happened years ago.  the backfiring is effected by how I set the timing i.e. whether it backfires through the carbs or exhaust, however I can't seem to eliminate it.  All ignition parts are new except the spark plug wires.  I have not done a compression test, therefore the obvious question of what shape the valves are in has not been answered, however gas mileage is reasonable about 18 to 22 miles / gallon.  I have just finished adjusting the valves, they seemed to have been set closer than the recommended tolerance, on most valves I could not get my feeler gage between the rocker arm and the valve stem, however this maybe because the valve clearance is small, oil film strength in .1mm gap is high and it is not easy to line up a feeler gage in a .1mm gap while lying on your back etc.

4.	When I lift my foot off the gas, the engine does not drop in RPM unless I have the original idle set at about 150 to 200 Rpm, i.e. adjusting the screw that determines how far the butterfly valves are open with my foot off the gas peddle.  The Zenith carbs have a  gas enrichment subsystem that injects gas into the manifold as a function of Rpm and throttle position, it is supposed to eliminate hydrocarbon emissions when the engine slows down.  Someone disconnected this sub system.  I did not about this subsystem  until I studied the shop manuals.  Given Webber carbs this auxiliary injection system can be adjusted to control the engine drop in Rpm when butterfly valves are closed, no such adjustment appears on the Zenith setup.

5.	I had the tie rod ends replaced and the car aligned by a shop that came well recommended.  Now at speed, it feels like the back end is swaying, is this shocks, Would improperly torqued lug nuts cause this sensation, or did the alignment shop screw up (yes the tires pressure is correct.) 

6.	Rust is starting to form under the paint in the headlight gasket grove.  I started to remove the rust, and found that a small hole has rusted through.   Can anyone recommend a good Porsche body shop in the Boston MA. area that understands how to permanently fix this seemingly simply but difficult problem?

7.	How do I deal with rust. prevent it, fix it, etc.  There are some spots that are starting to "bloom" where the undercoating has worn away from the bottom of the car, how do I treat it?  I will not run the car in the winter time because the roads up here are heavily salted and sanded, the sand abrades away protective surfaces, and the saltwater solution dissolves steel.

8.	I have a oil level gauge that is not working, I suspect the sender unit, but have not trouble shoot this problem yet.  How do I get at the oil sender unit?  My shop manuals do not show a oil tank with a sender unit in it.  Do you have to dismantle the oil tank from the fender well to get at the sender unit?  Is there a oil leak risk if I disconnect the oil lines from the tank then reconnect them?  Should I replace the oil lines with new ones if I have to dismantle the tank?

I am of the school that gets as much satisfaction from making the car run right, as that great feeling when you've taken a difficult corner at speed with grace and beauty.  Except for the machine shop stuff, front end etc. I get great pleasure from working on the jewel.

Kevin,

I agree on many issues. You are right in that people use their real names.
However, that is true for most e-mail as almost everybody includes a
"signature" listing usually more than a name with frequently place of
employment and other info. Few people indeed address each other by screen
handles.
As to the traffic, if you are looking for financial and car-buying info, you
are dead on again. I appreciate people having different interests. For
myself, I am looking for brand specific info (Porsche) on advanced technical
and maintenance issues. It is neither on Compuserve nor America Online. The
car lists on the Internet have a wealth more of information. For example,
Porschephiles has national experts and hands-on experienced enthusiasts
contribute on a daily basis. I can quote the presence of Bruce Anderson
(911), Jim Pasha (924/44), George Beuselinck (944), and George Hussein (914)
as an example. Porschephiles distributes probably 50 messages a day, 1500 a
month etc.(If I look at the technical car messages on CompuServe I see maybe
50 topics a MONTH). With CompuServe pricing structure, it quickly adds up.
Take a surcharge for 9600 Baud access etc. AOL gives me all the above for
about $9 a month.
Again, I should have specified my comments in view of MY specific needs which
are access to the Internet in a most convenient and economic way. I had not
in mind a comparison between online services...
Hope this puts my comments in a different light :-)

Subject: 924 Turbos&Timing belts :^)

Hello Naresh,
	Glad to see your tilt to 924 Turbos.  I just looked through my 
latest Performance Products catalog and found prices on turbos (I just 
LOVE specifics :^) and they want $699 for a rebuilt turbo for an '82 
924T.  They also offer a repair kit (for professionals) for $149, but 
then you must have a mechanic do it and it probably works out the same.  
By the way, are you capable of doing minor repairs and adjustments from 
time to time?  Your maintenance costs will be higher than mine if your 
not able to do minor things.  Get a Haynes manual ($13.99) for the 
924/924T, it can help ANYONE repair their car.  Also get a subscription 
to European Car Magazine ( $18.95 per year), its the BEST magazine for 
locating cheap part advertisers and repair advice.  
	About the timing belt, 30K is the recommended interval, and I've
changed mine once since I got it ( $19 and a Sunday afternoon).  It might 
be harder to replace a 924T belt but it was no sweat for mine.  Again I 
can't stress enough the need to purchase a well maintained, good 
condition example.  You will be sorry if you will have to pay for parts 
that regular maintenace could have prevented.  The car should not drive 
you to the poor house unless you're extremely unlucky, just expect to 
spend a little time with it.  I usually reserve one Sunday per month to 
do little things like maintenace, washing, and occasional minor repairs.  
If you have no time or an ounce of mechanical knowledge, buy a Toyota.  
If you do, it will be the most pleasurable driving experience you will 
ever know!!!  Good Luck

Subject: 924T Costs

Naresh,
Figure from $600-800 for a rebuild on the turbo if you have a good, non-factory
P-car mechanic put in a kit.  The timing belts are not a big deal to put in 
yourself on the 924T.  They cost ca. $20, are the same as for the none turbo,
and take no more than a couple of hours if you are an average mechanic learn-
ing about your new car.  I suggest you replace the belt tensioner at the same 
as the belt.  They cost ca. $30, but not something you want to go bad after
you have just pulled off everything to put on a new belt.  The '82 931 engine
is very durable if you keep the oil changed, etc.  Mine had 107K on it when
I sold it last year (after 5 years of ownership).  As far as I know, it had
never had the head off and burned no oil.  I did have to repalce the camshaft
and followers ($), the turbo wastegate ($), and the turbo was also rebuilt at
about 84K miles.  If you do buy this car, follow the common sense rules for
this generation turbo, viz. change the oil and filter every 2-2.5K miles,
don't get on the gas immediately upon startup, and let the engine idle for
at least a minute or so before shutdown following any normal run.  The weak
point is the lubrication of the turbo bearings.  You don't want the lubri-
cant to get "coked" on the bearing surfaces because of high-temperature
breakdown.  Synthetic oils such as Mobil One are said to give superior
resistance to this, but I always used Castrol 20W-50 and change it often.
Have fun.

Subject: 914 1st gear

I have question about our 914 73 2.0L 1st gear engage:

To put it into 1st gear, I must put the shift lever exactly in the right
place. I push it hard to the left, then down and slightly to the right at
the last second. If I do not do this exactly 'right', the car is not in
gear at all; then a tap (sometimes more like a hard slam!) will usually
engage the lever so that it is in 1st. 2nd through 5th are pretty ok (2nd
has a slightly worn synchro, no big deal) The problem does not feel like a
synchro is gone, rather like some alignment problem in the lever to
transmission linkage. 

I can now shift this ok 80% of the time -- but the other 20% is a pain, 
and also, while I drive this car most every day, Fred drives sometimes 
too -- especailly at the track and going to and from the track. We'd like 
to fix it!

We are thinking about either (a) The adjustment to the shift linkage
described in the Shop book ( but which doesn't describe why one would want
to adjust and the other gears are fine -- we do not want to mess them up) 
or (b) Changing the shift bushings (but I've read that this is for a 
sloppy shifter and 5 of the 6 gears are not sloppy at all, they are very 
crisp)

Any ideas? Anyone have the same experience?

thanks,

Mark

Subject: Euro 930 charcoal canister / fuel tank breather

Looks like my previous message never made it. Sorry if you have
already seen it but here is a repost in case it really got lost:

Hi,
thanks to everyone who shed some light on the subject but I am still
very confused about the subject of fuel tank venting and federally 
mandated modifications thereto. 

Previously I mentioned that my euro 930 has a broken charcoal canister and
less than spectacular brake performance. Last night I found that these
subjects may actually be related, as I found out that one of the hoses to
the charcoal canister originates from a tap onto the thick hose connected
to the brake booster. I am very mechanically inclinded, but what I know
about brake boosters doesn't make sense to me. I read somewhere that 
engine vacuum is used for this purpose. 

What engine vacuum ? The air intake ? The same vacuum that is being 
pressurized with the turbo charger ? Wouldn't it waste engine performance
to divert the vacuum ? Also, why wouldn't it be dangerous to have an 
air/fuel mixture circulating in brake components that are likely to
get hot every once in a while ?

Since it doesn't seem like a factory unit, the idea of the charcoal 
canister seemed superfluous to me so I just connected the in and out
hoses together, removed the canister, and went for a test ride. There
was no extra performance in either the engine or the brakes, but after
a few minutes I heard a popping sound from the fuel tank area. With bad
conscience I immediately stopped and put the canister back in line, and
I heard a whooshing sound and another pop from the fuel tank as it 
expanded again after sucking in some air. So it is necessary, and it might
be dangerous to bypass it. But this really brings up another set of 
questions: Do US model 930s (or 911s for that matter) have a charcoal
canister ? If so, where and why don't euro models have one ? What is the 
intent of the law related to changing this plumbing ? It seems that the
modified plumbing is inherently less safe than any factory items!

So if you know anything about charcoal canisters / fuel tank venting /
the relationship to brake boosting I would really appreciate the info.
I saw that Performance Products has a book about brakes, and I intend
to get it. I already bought Zimmerman's book "Used 911 story". As a 
helpful Porschephile pointed out, it has some info about gray market
conversions. Are there any other references I should look at ? (I bought
the factory service manual for turbos but this info doesn't appear in it.
I guess I would need the other 2 volumes of the service manual but they
are so expensive!)

Thanks, Ray

You need to ck out all the plastic bushings on your shift linkage. If 
any a worn replace with new ones. These are avail from Automotion, 
Tweeks, Perf prod and others. Cheap fix to try first. The one which will 
cause to most problem is the one at the side rear of the trans. also the 
one under the plastic cover on the trans shift lever if worn out will 
also you give you fits in shifting. 
The bushing in the rear firewall doesn't really wer that much and is a 
real bear to change so leave alone unless really worn.

Subject: Re: 914 heads

First, a question: why are you doing this??? The 2.0 heads in stock form
flow *plenty* of air for up to 7500 RPM with a decent valve job. If you
have 1.7/1.8 heads, you're screwed anyway -- they have bad design for moving
air, even using big valves. And with bigger valves, your low-RPM (i.e.
say under 5000 RPM) performane will just suck...

That being said: 

>    Mark Stephens high performance has advertised 

When helping a friend build a E Production legal engine for his 914, we
had occassion to use some of the Stephens products. The "ready to run"
"super high performance big valve ported and polished" heads had one or
two problems -- like *huge* gouges in the combustion chamber, unchamphered
at that; like the valves *DID NOT SEAT* and would not as a result hold
compression; like the valve springs were clearly pitted with rust.

When there were informed that the product as delivered was less than 
satifactory, they basicly said "so?". Fortunately, they had been
paid for by credit card, so it was possible for my friend to get
his money back and make the problem resolution part be someone else's
job. This *REALLY* pissed them off, since that meant that their
Visa merchant bank wanted to know how things had come to this point, 
gave them a "hickey" on their record, etc. Nasty phone calls followed,
but never ONCE was there an offer to make things right.

Note as well that Stephens is also "Rad Tech Racing" in case you see ads
from THEM.

My basic policy: if you see big flashy ads, don't go there. Quality work takes
time, and costs money. You typically don't have money left to pay for the 
fancy flashy ads. Remember, how many high quality heads can you *DO* in 
a day/week/year?? If you want great heads, go to FAT.

Well, today isn't going very well.  Between my extravagant fish tail in the

Which brings me to my question: last time it was replaced, it cost $683.75

Mark:

The symptoms you describe afflict most 914s that I've driven.  You may 
want to try putting the lever in a high gear, like 4th or 5th, before 
trying to shift into 1st.  This sometimes helps.

The shift-linkage alignment shouldn't affect the engagement of the other 
gears; part of the alignment procedure involves making sure that 4th 
gear is still reachable.

The shift bushings are a good upgrade -- Otto's (310 399-3221) makes 
some trick bronzite bushings -- but they're probably not the answer to 
your particular problem.

Yep, the 15's are still a consideration. These 16's are a pretty good deal
though and I do like how they look on my car.  I tried the 7x16 with the

I kind of like the way mine looks too.  Without the Fuchs my 911 attracts
no attention except from other Porschephiles many of whom, strangely
enough, think it's a 912!  I don't mind this lack of attention at all.

>If you find the wheels you want, will you part with your steel wheels?

That's something I'll have to think about.  Right now I have no plans of
selling my 911 but if I ever do, I will want to sell it as original as
possible which will include the original steel wheels.  Also, should I ever
get around to doing a total restoration (sometime after I buy my '93 RS
America), I will want the steel wheels.  I'll think about it though.

Thanks Dave for your advice!

The mini was the first prod car with a tranverse front engine/fwd, I

I never drove a rally or autocross mini, but I read that they were

As most of you probably know by now the Kremer Brothers' Porsche Spider K8
won the Daytona 24.   It was the 19th time Porsche has won the Daytona 24. 
An Olsmobile Spice was second (five laps behind), Paul Newman and company
came in third overall in a Rausch Racing Mustang & took first in  GTS1.  A
911 Turbo driven by Rohr, Murry, & Haywood was 4th overall and 2nd in GTS1.
 A Porsche 911 RSR driven by Byner, Calderari, Mastropietro, & Richter was
5th over all & first in GTS2.  

However, you might all find a local story rather interesting.  A *street
legal* 993 owned by Nort Northam of Orlando ran the the entire race,
finished 26th and then (according to the local news) drove back home to
Orlando.  Nort (who owns a local Porsche garage and sells a wide variety of
used sports cars) claims his team even drove the race on street tires.

Try to have the install done so its not obvious you have have a humongous
stereo system (e.g. hide what you're going to use for deep bass... a bazooka
out in the open is a "take me," even *with* an alarm, keep the factory

You can always put the fake flashing light in amongst the middle air
ventilation grills, meaning no drilled holes. You should have some kind of
flashing light. With the sticker, you're assuming thieves are literate, and
will take the time to read the sticker :)

> the factory stickers because it is obvious that I do not have a factory alarm?

No.

>Any theives out there who can tell me how their brains work?!  -Confused 928

Well, if you're worried about the *car* being stolen, that's one thing. If
you're worried about the car being mutilated, that's another. If all you're
worried about is your stereo/contents, I'd make sure they're well hidden.
*Especially* make sure there's no loose stuff in the car, like a briefcase
(or anything that could contain a laptop. Laptops are big items, now). You
don't want to encourage a "smash'n'grab" kind of thief...

Unneccessary aside: Most of the car stereo thieves around here are kids,
under 18 (so they fall under juvenile law). An older kid shows them what to
do, and they go as a gang to hit an apt. bldg. or an underground parking
lot. Whatever you can do that advertises "I'm noisy, I have an alarm, and
there's nothing that's smash'n'grab in me, anyways" will encourage these
kids to move on to another car... I've met enough of these kids, and believe
me, working brains are *not* are pre-requisite.

"Pros," who are after your car, are another matter.

Subject: 914 1st gear

        Mark, I have always had the exact same problem (hard to engage
first gear). I did replace the bushings in the shift linkage, which made it
a little easier to shift into first gear, but the problem persisted. I also
fooled with the alignment of the shift linkage (by loosening coupling
between shifter and shift-rod), which helped incrementally. NOw, if I pull
very hard to the left before engaging first, it always works, without
having to pull back too hard. I think, however, that the spring which
resists pulling to the left is too stiff to make shifting easy. Perhaps
this could be modified, but then reverse would be too easy to engage
inadvertently. Michael

I'm sure you all remember that today is the first day that you can mail in
your registration for the 1995 Porsche Parade in Portland, Oregon. You can
find the form in the November, 1994 issue of Panorama.

Only 625 entries will be accepted this year, so don't delay; it's expected to
be a sell out. It's generally first come, first served by postmark.

Check that the antenna is well grounded to the wing, a bit of salt at 
this time of year will scupper the motor.

In theory it should be earthing through a strap, if the arial has been 
replaced with a pattern copy, the fitter may have omitted the strap - 
result arial only grounds through the antenna to hole in wing connection.

Subject: Stan's 914


Fellow Pfiles,

There was an outpouring of warm feelings towards Stan over the weekend
triggered by my suggestion of a collection for him.

30 people enthusiastically offered to make contributions to the fund.

For those who missed my posting, I repeat it here:

++++++++++

To: porschephiles@tta.com
Subject: Stan, his 914 & us

I think that the person who suggested that we porschephiles
contribute to buy Stan's 914 racecar for Stan had a very good idea.


Here's my thought:

There are about 500 people on the list (More, I think. I haven't kept the
recent listing of all the names.)

Stan wants $7000 for his car. 

This works out to approx $10-$15 per person.  We have each SURELY gotten this
much value and enjoyment out of pfiles.

SO -- Here's my suggestion:

Each person willing to donate $15 (or more!) should send me an email
off-line, stating his email and willingness to contribute $15. If I get a
critical mass of these I'll let everyone know and the pledgees can actually
make their donations.


		     SEND ME THESE EMAILS BY FEB 11 !!!

If too Few sign up, the idea is a Did Not Start. If Many sign up it's a Go.
If Very Many sign up, the rate per person goes down.

I'll let everyone know the results by Feb 15.

OK???

Subject: Re: Rolex 24


I don't usually follow up my own posts, but in this case
I would like to point out that the speeling mistakes in my last post
were due to foaming-at-the-mouth syndrome induced by the excellent
results from Daytona. I'm feeling much better now.

On another note, I had my street-only 911 lowered by ~30 mm, and 
full geometry and corner balance done at Bob Watson Motor Sport. I have 
had to swap garages with the gf, because the ramp into garage is too steep
and the 911 would ground unless driven in and out with exceeding
care! Apart from that, the lowering and suspension set-up, have sharpened 
up the turn in, much improved the overall "tightness" of the handling. I 
notice that the rear drifts *much* more predictably under power and is
easy to control with tiny amounts of opposite lock and throttle adjustment.

Straight line stability seems much better and in fast sweeping
turns, it now feels like it runs on rails rather than the rather
vague feelings the back end used to make. I have 7J and 8 J x 16
Fuchs with standards section Yoko A008P, and the gaps
between the tyre and wheel arch seem tiny, you can just about get
your finger in between, but even so there was no evidence of the tyre 
making contact, even during extreme cornering force. I can only assume
that under heavy cornering load, the top of they tyres just fit past
the inner lip of the wheel arches, but the clearance must be a few
millimetres at best. Money well spent IMHO, significantly enhanced
the all ready very high big-grin factor associated with this car.

Anyone know what is needed to put turbo brakes into an 88 Carrera? I 
have a technical question. Is there any benefit from upgrading a regular 
Carrera to turbo brakes without increasing the tyre contact patch? Given 
that you can lock the brakes at almost any speed in a 88 911, surely one
must increase the amount of rubber on the road in order to apply more
breaking force. Does anyone have the facts on this one?

Regards

Subject: remedy for stuck disk brake pistons



I've been doing a total brake R&R on an Alfa Spider this winter and
found a good solution for stuck pistons that will also work on p-cars.
I tried pushing them out the usual way with air, but even at 100psi
they wouldn't budge. I ended up using the master cylinder (out of the
car) and it worked great. I wouldn't recommend doing this with the 
master cylinder in the car because of the risk of getting brake fluid 
on paint. I bought an 8" piece of brake line with fittings ($1.75) to 
use as a shunt between the two unneeded holes in the master cylinder and 
used a piece of flexible brakeline to the brake caliper. From there it 
was easy:

    - Bleed the air out of the caliper in the normal way.
    - Put the master cylinder in some kind of vice (I used a 
      cheap pipe vice that has one stationary end and an adjustable
      end that works on standard threaded pipe - "Pony Clamp")
    - Push the piston on the master cylinder in and out until one
      of the "stuck" pistons starts to move, then C-clamp it when it
      gets about 1/3 of the way out.
    - Continue to pump until the opposing piston is all the way out
      and wiggle the first one with pliers, staying off of the polished
      surface.

This was a lot easier than it sounds. I had both stuck calipers done 
in about 1/2 hour. I used the brake fluid that I removed from the car
rather than waste new, and an old cookie sheet to catch the fluid when
the pistons finally came out. The other good thing about this method is
that the pistons don't pop out with explosive force - although you should
always keep your fingers out from between the pistons just in case.

All the bushings in my car are new - firewall, tranny bracket and the one
on the ball-end that comes out of the tranny.  Yet the problem continues.
The one on the tranny bracket is a bronze one from Otto's. I don't think
these are the problem.

I'd (we'd) like to know not just how to fix this problem (the concensus
seems to be that it's unavoidable), but WHY it happens with this tranny.

This reminds me of a quiet walk in the Cotswold hills many years ago.  My
sweetheart and I had just crossed over a "hump-backed" bridge over a small
stream in one of the most picturesque parts of Britain.  A tiny dot in the
distance very rapidly grew into the not-much-larger close up size of a
Mini Cooper.  Doing about 45-50 as he hit the take off ramp of the bridge,
I fully expected him to leave the ground.  I was just too far away to see
for sure.  What I was positive of, though, was that I was about to hear the
sound of breaking glass and crumpling metal.  What the Mini Cooper driver
didn't know was that immediately on the other side of the hump-backed bridge
was a T junction with a row of solid Cotswold stone houses extending to
form the top of the T.

The amazing part was that not only did I not hear a crash, I didn't even
hear his tires squeal!!!

I trotted back to the crest of the bridge to find nothing but a tranquil
village scene.

Frankly, I still think that little weenie disappeared into the twilight
zone.

Hello,

FOR SALE: 4 Fuch's w/tires for sale: $450

I have a set of 4 factory Porsche Fuchs rims that I am selling.
2 15x7's and 2 15x8's, off an 81 911SC.  Pirelli P-7's on all 4 rims.
They also have the Porsche black center caps installed on the
rims.  The rear tires may just pass inspection (ie: probably need
to replace them), but the front tires on the 15x7's are in good
shape.  Also, one 15x7 and one 15x8 rim have curb surface scratches
on the outer edge of the rims.  These can be sanded off with a light
sandpaper, or refinished if you want them to look like new.  The
rims are not bent or damaged in any other way and are the factory
alloy rims.  They are off of my 1981 Euro-911SC, I upgraded to the C4 
Turbo rims with a 930 body conversion.  

I do not have the exact tire sizes, but they are the standard size
Pirelli low-profile P'7 that would fit normally on these rims.
I am asking $450 for the entire set, YOU pay shipping.  I do NOT 
want to seperate the set or sell individually.  I live in Newton, MA, 
just outside of Boston.  Please call with any questions.  I am pretty
firm on the price, but if you live in CA or far away, shipping
may be expensive, so I would be willing to negotiate.

Thanks to all who replied with advice and concerns about my problem.  The
comment about the safety of "ANY" tire rubbing struck home.  I am also safety
conscious.   The best option appeared to be fender modification since I
really do like the handling balance with the current spring rates etc.
 What's a few hundred more for some paint work anyway?  I enlisted the help
of my friend the body man and worked out the flares to fully clear the tires
at their most extreme position.  Boy - it really hurts to trash a new paint
job, but it seemed better than potentially trashing the whole car if driven
in an unsafe condition.  Now I can go fast again.  The 914 really is a
wonderful creature, all it ever needed was some POWER.

Subject: 944 vibration...

Here's one for your memory banks...

For a while, I was experiencing this really bad vibration on my 85.1 944.
It would occur as I wound up the engine through the RPM range. It occurred
right at about 2800 and until 3200. It was comming from the driver's side.

At first I thought, exhaust system. Went over it from one end to the other.
The vibration, exhibited the tipical exhaust vibration as you went over the
RPM range. Something was resonating at that specific RPM (frequency). I ruled
out motor mounts since car idles very smoothly.

Then I thought broken motor support. I had one of them break when some yahoo
tapped my 300d from the rear in traffic. I did not find anything on the 944. 

Well, I found my problem. Tapping around with my hand at the A/C compressor,
I noticed that the front washer was turning loosely. Yeap, I found that I had
a broken bolt that held the A/C to its mount. I was lucky enough, that there
were two threads extending out from the broken bolt. I got it out using
needle nose pliers. Replaced the bolt (8.8 grade, like before) and the
vibration HAS GONE AWAY!

I figured I pass the info along to all of you. You never know when it might comehandy...

substantiate (OR DENY) IMSA's original claim that Porsche had an "unfair
advantage" for which the infamous last minute rule change came about?
*That's* what's needed as the real follow-up to IMSA.

The ethics of enacting a performance penalty rule on a specific model
because they are more reliable mechanically is a different question.
I'm just curious to find out who was right on the specific issue raised.

Hi, Kirk.

Strange place for an air leak, but...

if you remove the oil filler tube, you will see a couple of rubber
O-rings that are supposed to seal the beast.

I would suggest replacing those and rechecking.

Good Luck,

Hi, Steve,

No reason why it shouldn't work, if you replace the wiring harness,DME and
KLR, and airflow sensors, and turbo.

For that kind of money, though, you ought to consider rebuilding the unit.

My experience is that you could rebuild the motor correctly for $1000 or so.

Robert:

Before I put the six in my 914, Mark Stephens built my 4-cylinder with 
those valves, and I was very happy with it, even though I was still 
running the stock (well... almost stock) fuel injection, rather than 
the carbs for which those valves are ideal.  It was my daily driver, and 
I had no problems with low-speed driveability.

The motor lasted for years; I finally sold it, when it developed a 
totally unrelated problem, to a local PCA member who's here on the list, 
but may not want to be identified (I don't know what class he's running 
his car in).  Stephens Machining had done his motor, too, and he wanted 
mine for the spare parts.

Oh, by the way... I should mention that my engine was a 1.7-liter.  If 
you've already got the 2-liter heads, you may want to think twice 
before cutting them up; they're pretty good as they come from the 
factory (and valuable).

Also... I've heard from people who've had distinctly unsatisfactory 
experiences with Mark Stephens.  As I said, I was happy with my motor, 
but...

          Stereo's are one of the few things for Porsche's that are
          not only hard to install, but to install them correctly
          takes time, hard work, and a good degree of patience.
          If anyone is wondering what the "Best Sounding" stereo
          equipment is out there, it would be hands down a set of
          tweeters called "Waveguide Tweeters"  They are a special set
          of tweeters with an incredible soundstage.  They work on a
          "horn" premise, but the sound is crisp, clean, and
          incredible at any audible levels.  They run for about 170 a
          pair, but of all the seperates that I have heard, they were
          the most clear for any type of music.  For any of you that
          are really into doing the "Ultimate Install"  one servo
          controlled subwoofer would do as much as 4 good 10" regular
          subs.  But they cost about 1,500 a piece.  The best thing is
          that with the waveguide tweeters and a servo controlled
          subwoofer, you only need about 100W of power and it will be
          plenty.  One of the great things about servo controlled subs
          is that they are clear down to 20Hz or lower.

Subject: Need advice on 3.2L 911 engine noise

I have just completed the 60K mile service on my 86 911 after being gone to
France for an extended period of time. I have not driven the car for about
2 months until last week. I have noticed a noise from my engine that I did
not remember it having.

The engine makes a clicking noise that gets more pronounced as the engine
warms up. The noise can be heard inside the car when running the engine
beteen 2500 and 3000 RPM. It should be noted that I have the rear deck
removed to repair a rear speaker, so the engine noise in general is louder.
The sound is like a sparking noise, as opposed to a pinging noise.

I am not an expert mechanic by any means, so the possible sources I list
might sound dumb.

Possible problems:

   1. Valve adjustment (just adjusted them and checked the clearence twice).
   2. Bad valve
   3. Fuel injectors (do they make any noise?)
   4. Spark plugs
   5. Intake manifold leak
   6. Exhaust leak

I have thought of recording the engine after it warms up and than playing
back the recording into an audio file on my SUN SPARC. The audio file could
then be sent to someone, or FTPed to a server. If anyone with the experience
to diagnose 911 engine problems by listing to them has the time and capability
to playback an audio file, please let me know. Maybe this could be a new area
of information provided by the Porschephiles, training via the Internet.

Thanks!

Subject: Re: charcoal canister and power brakes

Ray

I assume your 930 vacuum is plumbed similarly to my 931...

Yes the brake booster derives its power from engine vacuum.  On the
Turbo models, engine intake vacuum can be drawn at the air metering
box, after the filter (which allows the vacuum to exist) and before
the turbo and fuel injection.  This line is Teed into the brake
booster and the charcoal canister.  The other side of the canister is
connected to fuel system and crankcase vents.  The idea is that when
the car sits idle, hydrocarbon vapors that collect in the fuel and
crankcase are absorbed in the charcoal canister as they boil off.
When the car is driven, these vapors are then sucked into the engine
air intake to be burned.  Non-US cars may not require that these
vapors be scavenged, so the canister may be omitted altogether.

The brake booster draws outside air to operate against the vacuum.
Note that there is no "fuel-air mix" involved in the brake booster,
since the vacuum is DRAWING air rather than PUSHING it to the booster.

There is no degradation in engine performance to using vacuum this
way... the vacuum is a nearly unavoidable condition of street
induction systems.  You and I are fortunate that we have turbochargers
so that our engines never see an intake vacuum at the cylinders!!

If your charcoal canister is toast, you better plug that line until
you replace the canister, so that the brakes will work in the mean time.

I was at Daytona this past weekend.  What a blast!  In a field of 74, 
there were 26 Porsches, including the 993 above.  We talked with the 
crew in the pits after the race, and they said they had done nothing to 
the car except change the brake pads and add a roll cage.  They did run 
on street tires, and only added 1/2 qt of oil for the whole race.  They 
were very excited to have finished, and their experience spoke to the 
amazing cars that the factory produces for the street.

We camped in the infield, and went to sleep to the sound of RSRs 
winding through the gears...

Too bad the Porsche factory team didn't come.  The Ferrari WSC cars 
(there were four, I think) were in the top three spots for the first 14 
hours or so.  I woke Sunday morning around 6:00 and the announcer was 
talking about the leading car having been stuck in the pits for 30 
minutes because they couldn't get it started.  They eventually gave up. 
 Another Ferrari team cut a hole in their engine cover to allow the pit 
crew to keep the car running w/ the throttle during driver changes.  
These cars sounded amazing when they were running.

Subject: Greetings.

Hello follow Porsche people! I just thought I'd throw out an introduction.

Jeff's the name. I work in the part department at the local Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Rover, and yes, 
Porsche, dealer.

My car (that relates to this list) is a 1975 Porsche 914 1.8l; red on black. Just bought it last winter, drove it 
much of last summer, and it'll be my only summer car this summer, so I haven't been able to do 
EVERYthing I want to it... yet. :)

The thing that gets the most attention is the 5-point TRW Sabelt racing harnesses. They really look great 
constrasting with the seats.

While I have your attention, a couple quick 914 questions...
First, I have a strange fourth gear problem - the car won't stay in gear. If I put it in gently and stay on the 
gas, it'll stay in, but as soon as I let off the gas, it pops right out. I'm hoping it's not a big, expensive fix.

Secondly, I have the stock steel wheels with 195/50/15 tires on it. I REALLY wanna move onto alloy 
wheels, especially since one of the wheels is a little bent and leaking air. (Whatta pain!) Anyone have any 
nice-condition old 914 wheels lying around they'd like to sell cheap? Of course, I'd kill for a set of 15x5.5 
Minilites (or Panasports), but I doubt I'll find those. :)  In terms of stock wheels, I'd prefer the ones with 
the large dome in the middle and eight spokes coming off it.

Thanks much!

Looking for a factory manual?

Somewhere in the archives I came across a message from someone who ordered the Porsche factory manual on microfilm from TMC Publications.  I 
needed to get a manual myself, so I gave them a call.  At $49 + shipping, it is a heck of a lot better than paying hundreds for the printed copy!

The 928 set comes on 17 pages of microfiche (the small squares about the size of a big index card).  It includes everything (in English!)

I was able to place my order over the telephone with Visa.  The 928 manual was in stock, shipped immediately, and arrived 3 days later by UPS ground.  

I had the manual shipped to my place of business.  When the mailroom couldn't track it down, Jeff Foland (TMC), was VERY helpful.  He returned my calls 
promptly and obtained delivery confirmation from UPS.  When the mailroom still had trouble, Jeff offered to deal with UPS himself and to send a 
replacement manual at no charge to me. [the mailroom later found the manual]  All the time Jeff was courteous, friendly, and helpful.

I was so impressed by Jeff and TMC's commitment to customer satisfaction, I just had to pass it on.  So if you need Porsche doc's (or Benz, BMW, Audi, or 
Jaguar) call Jeff at TMC (410) 367-4490.  They're in Baltimore, MD.

Subject: 944 Wipers


With the recent spate of posts on this topic, I wanted to ask two questions. 
 First, what is the correct wiper size for a 1983 944?  Is it 18 inches or 
20 inches?

Second, looking at the Bosch wipers, which is the correct mounting adapter 
to use?  Is it the V9?  It seems a little too big to me...

>-Confused 928

I thought all 928's had a factory alarm standard?  Two keys, one longer key that turns a deep tumbler to activcate the alarm?
Or, was this added in a particular model year?

I bought my 928 about a month ago, and a longer key wasn't available.  I'm not sure if I have a factory alarm or not.  I did find a manual for an 
"Excalibur" alarm in the glove box, so it appears to be an aftermarket.  I haven't had a chance to investigate this setup, but the thing squawks every time I 
start up the car...

In my opinion, a kill switch with delay would be effective against car thieves and carjackers, a stereo with a removable faceplate effective against stereo 
thieves, and an electric fence against moonlighting tow truck drivers!

Oh yeah? My laser produces optical pulses that are 100 femtoseconds (fs) in
duration. A femtosecond is ten to the minus fifteenth seconds. Thats zero
to 300,000,000 (that's 3 times ten to the 8, if I miscounted zeros) meters
per second in 100 fs. Of course each pulse contains less than 10 nanojoules
of energy.

I concede.  Anyway, you can have your "ten to the minus whatever"
facts.  Most of us little boys prefer large numbers of zeros to the LEFT
of the decimal point, this is much better correlated with lots of smoke,
noise, high speeds, property and/or environmental damage, and other 
cheap thrills.  How much fun can you have with a wad of photons only

Subject: 924/944 Shifter Rattle and electric antennas


In addition to Pete's comments on the subject,

The shifter rod wears where the rod connects to the shift lever. The
pin on the lever gets eaten and the pin is now loose in the rod end.
It will rattle. Just replacing the lever doesn't help because the rod
is worn in the connector tube and will eat the pin again. Replace 
both AND the pivot bushing (plastic) under the shift level.

Heating the plastic bushing (if it hasn't broken) in very hot water
makes it expand enough to remove. Do the same to install the 
replacement. The shifter rod can be removed with some cursing and 
disassembly from the car.

Electric Antennas. George wasn't being facetious. The usual failure 
mode is corrosion. When they get bad, toss them. Very rarely the 
failure is the relay, which can be crossreferenced to a Radio Shack
part. There are few serviceable parts. The antenna mast is replaceable,
wipe it with WD_40 on a rag every so often and it won't freeze up.

The replacement Hirschmann's run about $60 -80 and are physically 
different than the OEM units. They fit and are electrically the same.

The 901 is basicly a racing 4-speed (2nd-5th) with a first and reverse

Hi,

  Right, I am new for Porsche world.
Please forgive me for some stupid questions.  
Got to working for Ph.D. and keeping 84' 944
running.  But I am quite professional in 
photography.  Own Nikon F, F-ftn, F2S, F2A,
F3HP, F4S, FE2, FM2n, Nikkormat FT3, Leica IIIC.
and lot of lenses.... Hopefully, will be master
in 944 later by your help.

  So can I ask another question? :) Thanks for
reply regarding antenna.
  
  The 944 came with 215/65-15 tires.
but I think the tires should be 215/60 for it.  
Is 215/65 still ok for it?  And other tires
I can try later.

The screws holding the foglight assemblies to my 1983 944 have  corroded.  I 
discovered this when I tried to open one up to change a burned out bulb.  It 
looks like I am going to have to drill the heads of the corroded screws off 
and then remove the rest with vice grips.  Before I do this, however, I 
would like to have replacement screws on hand.

I've been to the local dealer and my mechanic, and neither place has the 
screws I need.  Can someone tell me where I can find these things?  A set of 
specs to identify the part would be helpful too, as I can't get the old ones 
out to match them.

It's such a small part, but a major inconvenience.

Thanks in advance!

Cherie,
I've been to the Smog Police a few times with another type of car. They 
basically give there ignorant opinion and place a $ amount on the repair
to make it pass. If all the equipment is correct according to the state,
and the repair is appraised at higher than the $700, then they just give 
you a waiver(smog certificate) and your on your way. They don't actually do the repairs at the smog ref station. They may tinker a little to try to reduce the
emissions but no actual repairs. I actually posted a story about my experience

Subject: RE: Alarm stickers...

Craig:

Definitely get the stickers, a club and a flashing light! or better yet, 
get an good alarm system with a remote kill/panic switch and all of the 
above.  Below is a list of my break-ins to date here in Houston over the 
last 3.5 years with the lesson's I've learned from these experiences:

1) The first 944 I owned was broken into to grab a cheap cellular bag 
phone on the passenger floor board.  The factory alarm went off when they 
opened the door.  I ran outside only to find broken passenger's door glass 
everywhere. The break-in was my stupid mistake.  No stickers, no flashing 
light, obvious valuables on display as if my car were a shopping mall.

2) The second 944 I had was broken into to steal my CD player on the one 
night I didn't hide the remote.  My wife heard the alarm but ignored it.  
She thought it was another car.  I was fast asleep.  Only a neighbor's 
quick thinking kept them from getting the goods.  They heard the alarm, 
turned on their lights and opened the door to let their dog out.  All the 
wiring was torn out but easily fixable.  I had the club but no stickers 
and no flashy lights.  (you'd think I would have already learned my 
lesson)

3) Broke into my 1987 VW Jetta to steal a CHEESY Sanyo cassette deck that 
DIDN'T work.  The only protection the car had was a club.  I believe the 
car would have been stolen if the club was not on the steering wheel.  All 
cars now have an alarm with a flashing light, stickers everywhere, and a 
club.  No problems since.


This 944, '88 944 Turbo S, has it all.  Stickers, club, alarm, flashing 
light, kill switch, etc...  I've also talked to my neighbors and asked 
them to keep an eye out and call me if they notice anything.  I've taken 
the wife to the car and set off the alarm for her so she'll recognize it 
in the future.  I don't leave any valuables in the car AT ALL.  I've had 
the car for quite some time now with NO break-ins.  I also take a quick 
walk around the family cars at night to make sure they're all properly 
emptied, locked and their alarms are armed.  You'd be surprised how many 
times I've found my wife's car unsecured; ie., rear passenger side door 
unlocked and the club not installed.  

The moral to this story is,"Do everything reasonable to protect your 
property even if you live in remote Kansas.  It's your responsibility!"  
Your chances of a break-in are greatly reduced if you demonstrate OBVIOUS 
visual deterrents.  Should a break-in occur, YOUR NEIGHBORS are your BEST 
FRIENDS in helping you thwart the crime (by turning on a light or letting 
the dog loose) or helping you identify the specifics of crime such as a 
description of the vandal.

Hope this helps,

Subject: 914: in cold, idle and die problem

  Hi all.  This problem hasn't popped up but twice, since it's been a mild
  winter, and since I commute by bike (when I can).  My new (to me) '75 914
  (2.0l) apparently doesn't much like the cold.  It has an uneven idle
  (putting it mildly) when warming up, for the first two minutes, and then
  settles down.  Well, this morning (7 degrees, not counting wind chill), I
  started it ok and was letting it warm up... idled ok, a little rough
  running, for 90-12 seconds or so.  Then it cut out, suddenly.  Started it
  again, ran a few seconds, died.  And again.  Repeat, with shorter running
  interval.  I finally got it semi-moving, out onto the street.  Added a
  little Drygas and Octane Booster ("appeared" to work last time), shook
  liberally, got rolling again.  It gradually corrected itself, and was ok
  once it got warmer, ran fine, no cutting.  Question is, why is it running
  for a little, and then cutting out?  Frankly, I just don't think the
  Drygas/etc. does any good, since this happened before when it was really
  cold... and I buy super-premium gas... I mean, water in the line twice
  like that?  Seems a little improbable IMHO... So, what is it?  Related to
  rough idle normally (vacuum leak?  haven't tried to fix yet)?  Probably,
  but as you can tell from this presentation, I'm not necessarily
  mechanically "apt" (but ya' gotta start somewheres).  Any ideas? Anyone
  seen this?

Subject: Re: Screws and other small parts

In my experience, the best all-around source is Stoddard, who has an
800 number (don't have it handy, but it's always in Pano, and probably
listed with 800 information).  Their prices are reasonable, especially
considering they're an authorized Porsche dealer, and they will refer
you to an aftermarket source if what you need isn't a Porsche part.
(Your local dealer will probably feign ignorance about anything
non-factory, and will probably have a higher starting price for the
part.)

Most of all, they *don't* sock you for unreasonable shipping and
"handling" charges.  They charge *actual* shipping, which can be as
little as what it costs to put a stamp on an envelope and put it in
the mail.

So I'm sure they have the screws you need, and that they can get them
to you for a fair price.

BTW, I wanted to replace the 25th anniversary sticker on the right
quarter window of my 911.  A concours aficionado I know bought one at
a swapmeet for $75!  Stoddard has those for about $5.00.  They 'fess
up that it's a repro, but I defy anyone to tell it from the original.

During my restoration of a 1970 911T, I mistakenly ordered the

Apparently, my T has an E/S fuel pump which necessitates the use of
a fuel filter with 8mm hose pickup.  I purchased the 6mm version.

As the dealer will not take this back (da!), I am willing to offer
this to anyone for below cost.  It is unused, new condition.
It should fit any 911T from 1965-1973.

I have recently acquired (at no cost) a running 1969 Opel GT (it looks like a

Does anyone know of an Opel club, parts supply house, junk yard, etc.

Thanks in advance.

Both incidents happened under warranty and involved Reno because the factory 
authorized service was negligent. The first incident happened 1k miles after 
my 30k service after I asked that the belt be serviced and Porsche had an 
advisory out to replace the belt with a revised one.

My point is that most of the valves were replaced and either Reno picked up 
the tab or the dealer did. Either way, I'm sure they didn't replace one 
extra screw.

That's my financial answer but I'm sure someone can give a better technical 
one.

Yes, I had a feeling this was true - after all, when I'm really enjoying my
914, 1st isn't even in the picture!

I always found it sad that "due to customer complaints" Porsche and BMW did
away with dog-leg 1st gear shift patterns.  Yes, it's a drag in traffic
when 1st is recalcitrant, but when you're _driving_ having a straight shot
down to 2nd from 3rd as you approach a turn is great!

Take your VIN to your friendly Porsche dealer and ask if the car should
have a factory alarm. If so, they can make or have made the original
master key. This is great if the car has not been re-keyed.

When I purchased my '83 928S, I too didn't get a master key. Had one made.
Found it does not fit in the driver's door (too long.) Is this correct or
has somebody plugged my lock? Works fine on the hatch and ignition. Fits
in the passenger door but nothing works on the passenger door, apparently
the door was replaced and not the lock. Guess I should try arming it and 
try to set it off.

For my money, the Valentine One is the only way to go.  Here in 
Virginia, it has saved my butt more times than I can count and has also 
saved me in Maryland, where they use laser.  The V1 wins the faceoffs in 
the mags and the Bel usually finishes second.  Both offer stealth (which 
means cops using the VG-1 radar detector detector can't sniff you out). 
 In Virginia, where the things are illegal to use, the stealth feature 
is a must.  The V1 also offers a remote light faceplate that lets you 
put the warning lights down on the dash and out of the line of sight.  
Bel offers a remote version, which the V1 is not, but remote are 
considered less useful because the antenna is mounted too low for long 
distance.  Be prepared for a long wait for a V1.  It took six months to 
get mine back in 1992 and then eight months before my name came up in 
rotation to get the wideband and laser update.

Don't get taken by such claims.  Radar scramblers, as a rule, don't work 
and if they did they'd be so patently illegal that it would cost you a 
lot more than a ticket.  Go for the Valentine One wideband/laser

I second all the praise given about the V1. Last summer I had to wait
less than 4 weeks. I think this kind of backlog is unnecessary and
arrogant on Valentine's part. They inflated the delivery time and had
an attitude.

V1: "The delivery time is currently six weeks" (with a take it or leave
tone in their voice)

WCH: " You must be very proud....... I'll order one anyway"

V1: pause

I would not buy another product from them except that they are the only
game in town for serious radar detection.

A V1 is indespensible. A very impressive device and worth every penny.

Subject:       Strange 911 engine noises

Whilst out and about this weekend in my '75 911S, I had occasion
(and clear road) to put the pedal to the floor from 1st to 3rd gear
(whee!). However, when I hit around 5500 rpm in 2nd (just before I
shifted) I heard a strange sound from the engine.  Kind of a metallic
zinging or buzzing, like a very fast drum-roll on a cymbal.  

I have heard this once before (a few weeks ago), but I didn't think
much of it.  This time I was paying attention, and I was disturbed. 
The car still runs fine, I haven't noticed anything odd before or
since.  I didn't think to check the mirror for smoke, but it was
dark anyways.  The car was in for a tune up (oil, valve adjust,
checkup, etc.) in December, and got a clean bill of health

So, what does this mean?  Am I in for pain and $uffering?  Autocross 
season is upon us, and I don't want to miss it for a blown engine...

About your 914-6, 
Are your Bilstiens racing (fully threaded bodies) or street shocks? What is
the free length of your springs? If they are actually hypercoils, I assume
they would be 2-1/2"x10" freelength. 10" springs on race or stree shocks on a
car that has been lowered a great deal may bottom out the shock, but this all
depends on the compression of the springs! Most of the time they are and
should be set to where the shock will not burn out. Rather, the spring will
hit almost full compression even under the most radical of loads and not
bottom out. Typically, the spring should only compress around 30-50 percent
of freelength. It should not hit by the way it sounds. However, your choice
of spring may be too soft for a track car. What rate torsion bars do you
have? Do you have a rear sway bar?

Hate to sound like an opportunist bastard, but........

Your transmission has the classic symptoms of trashed synchros.  It's
normal for a 914 to crunch a little going into 1st, (Also synchro problems,
but the fix is expensive, and doesn't last long.)  But popping out of
4th is a "bad thing".

I have a transmission out of a '73 that I will probably never use.  I didn't
put a lot of miles on it, but it seemed to work just fine.  I could sell it
for the core charge.

I also have a set of VERY non-stock alloy wheels that were removed from a 
914 that I would GIVE you.  They fit and look fine, but require conversion
from lug bolts to lug studs.

Let me know if you're interested.

the trick for tires (at the track) is to put shoe polish over the edge of
the tire. after the session see how far the tire rolled over by by how far
down the sidewall the polish was removed. if its past the edge of the
tread, add air. The right way is to check the tread temp across the
surface, but a 29 cent squeeze tube of shoe polish is cheaper (much). on
the street, the old pressures are probably ok, anything in the low to

I've lived with this niggling problem for the last couple of years now
(well, ever since i've

of a cause or
has, perhaps, run into this before:

on occasion (yes, intermittently) my '89 930s (targa) is killed with
extreme prejudice  by
my rear wiper.

i'll just hit the switch and immediate clinical death occurs.  All
other systems seem
unaffected.  The lights are on but noone is home.  We are talking 911 turbo
Out-O-Body experience...

in order to revive the patient i must return the ignition switch to
"off" and start
the car again (ie: with starter).

I live in the Seattle area wherein we get more then a bit of rain so this
behavior is especially annoying...

My mechanic has repro'd it several times and is at a loss (and also
recommends against paying $60/hr to track such a thing down).

any and all ideas would be gratefully received.

Just back from the Post Office, I mailed in my registration for the Parade
this year.  I've seen messages about other Pfiles coming, and I know that
there is going to be something at Reno the week previous.  I've only seen one
other PDX local Pfiler make mention of it though (Nguyen Nguyen?).  

Would there be interest in an informal gathering the day before  (Saturday)
th Parade starts?  Tentatively it could include some nifty local roads,
sharing of knowledge about good restaurants to go to, or sights to see that
usually only Oregonians are aware of, or possibly even places to avoid
because of gendarmes.

I'll volunteer here and now to be the official keeper of Parade 95 rsvp's.  
As well as offer the services my little shop can offer if something breaks.
As well I have lots of parking space if you want to stash a trailer or tow
vehicle for the week, however I live about 30 minutes from PIR, so if you
want to detail your concours car at my place, while you're more than welcome,
you might have road grime to clean off at the track again.

 Reply to:     RE>1984 928

Matt,

  >>  I just bought a 1984 928 a month ago. 

Glad you like your new car ... I'm still thrilled every time I drive mine
even though I've had it for a year now.

  >>   What I don't know, and maybe you can help me, is if my car
  >>   is a 928 or a 928S.  I believe that the 928S came in 1985 and was
  >>  available in earlier years only in Europe.  Is this true? 
  >>  How can I tell? 

If your car has a front air dam and the (small) rear spoiler, it's a 928S.  
The S4 has the stiffer suspension and a larger rear spoiler.  
The pre-928S did not have a spoiler in the rear as far as I know.  Also,
the 928S has Bilstein shocks (they have a green dab of paint on
the shock body).

  >>  What have the major repairs been?

I have 131,000 miles on my car.  Unfortunately a lot of things
have gone wrong with the car, most of which I attribute
to deferred maintenance on the part of the previous
owner(s).  My biggest single expense was a transmission
rebuild when the mail bearing failed ($1700).

I had a problem with the servo unit that controls the air 
mix.  It was about $400 to replace (my labor).  Also, the 
voltage regulator is integral to the alternator so I had to
replace the alternator ... Porsche wants $899 for an alternator,
so I got the same one, brand new, for about $240 from
another source.  (Make sure the air hose bringing air to the
alternator is in place and not blocked!)

Try to find out when the last time your timing belt was replaced.  
I had mine done ($330 parts and labor at Porsche) and the old one was
beginning to fray a bit.  The belt itself is $35 from Porsche ... if
you're handy you can do the work yourself.  The hardest part
would be tensioning the belt without having access to the 
Porsche special guage.

I've discovered that the 928 needs frequent 
tender loving care and that the price of parts is about
three times higher than you might expect (my previous
car was a Datsun) and that very few parts can be purchased
from places like Pep Boys or Trak Auto.

Keep in touch ... I'll be happy to share information and 
lessons learned.

Subject: Gastester/O2 sensor/Tuning 911 MFI

Friends,
I've seen the JC Whitney CO tester discussed here and in other 
fora, and no one has been able to state definitively whether it is 
in fact a CO tester, or simply a garden variety O-2 sensor.  At 
$125,  which is about the same price as the unit advertised in 
Pano costs, and apparently the same price as the Edelbrock 
unit, I'd bet that it's nothing more than an O-2 sensor, which 
costs about $25 for a single wire type, and about $35 for a three 
wire type.

If anyone is really interested, I can post a fairly long, but 
accurate and informative item about O-2 sensors.   Briefly, an 
O-2 sensor generates 0 to 1 v; near 0v if the mixture is lean, 
near 1v if it is rich, and about 0.45v at stoich (when the air/fuel 
ratio is 14.7/1, exactly the right ratio to consume all the fuel 
and leave no excess O-2.)   The sensor output passes through 
0.45v very rapidly, so it gives a poor indication of the exact 
ratio, although it indicates lean and rich quite nicely.  You can 
monitor the output with a high impedance voltmeter, such as 
almost any digital voltmeter, or you can get fancy and 
construct an LED display, or analog meter, which apparently is 
what JC Whitney and others do.  It's a bit of a waste though, 
since the meter (or LED dsplay) will really just indicate lean, or 
rich, and not tell much about the actual ratio, even if it is 
"calibrated" in fuel/air ratios. 

One way EFI systems use the O-2 sensor is to constantly 
monitor its output and constantly adjust the fuel/air ratio to 
try to keep the average output at 0.45v.  If the EFI system 
senses a lean mixture it richens it, and vice versa.  If it does this 
often enough, say several times a second, on average you'll 
always be stoich.

The sensors operate near 600 degrees F.  The single wire 
variety needs to be installed right near the exhaust manifold 
where the gases are hot.  The three wire version has an internal 
heater  that operates  off the 12v car supply (hence the other 
two wires).  It can be installed anywhere in the exhaust system.

I used one to help tune the '72 911E I just restored.  I wanted 
something to help me set the MFI pump, which I had taken 
apart for refurbishing,  so it was way off adjustment when 
installed in the car.  I know how to do carbs, but MFI is new to 
me.  Unlike with carbs,  you can't adjust the MFI with the 
engine running,  so you can't easily tell what effect your 
adjustments are having.  

I bought the cheapest 3-wire O-2 sensor I could find and 
mounted it in a foot-long section of muffler pipe that I clamped 
to the tailpipe.  I ran the voltmeter wires outside the car, in the 
window, to a digital voltmeter sitting on the seat next to me, 
and watched it as I drove around.  I could see under what 
conditions I was lean or rich, and when I changed the MFI 
pump adjustments and drove the same course, I could see the 
effect.  It actually was kind of fun, and worth the $35.  

Just to see what the O-2 sensor would do on a well-regulated 
EFI system, I put it on my 1990 Subaru's tailpipe and drove 
around with it.  Amazing.  The voltmeter hovered bewteen 0.3 
and 0.6 volts under almost all conditions, hot, cold, under load, 
cruising, and so on, indicating that the mixture was almost 
always perfect.  It's remarkable what 25 years of engineering 
has done!

Has anyone else has tried using an O-2 sensor as a tuning aid?

 Here's the progress on my 66's rebuild project.

   Just received the oil pump back from Lukes&Shoreman. Notified that
the pump was in much better shape than ones they receive from the older
911's but, once you're in...you're in. The case, crank, heads and rods
have all been reconditioned, cleaned, magnafluxed or renewed (where
applicable). The rod from cyc #1 was not servicable. Another rod
was obtained and the whole set ballanced and rebushed. The sheet metal
was all sandblasted and refinished. Wednesday I will be taking the trip
to R&D in Coatsville to pick up the machine shop work. Guess aside from
reassembly and ordering the necessary gaskets, bearings, chains pistons and
cyls I'll be done ;-)

Subject: Re: Gastester/O2 sensor/Tuning 911 MFI


	I used an O2 sensor/digital meter as a tuning aid when I had my 89 
Supra Turbo. I had bought a digital fuel mixture meter that had 14 LED's.
5 yellow ones for lean, 4 green ones for stoich (how do you say this word?) and
5 red ones for rich.
I hooked it up to my O2 three wire sensor. I changed the programming of my CPU
thru a PFC-FCON (an enriching computer) and changed the fuel mixture as I 
increased boost from 5 psi to 15 psi. The response of the meter was instant and
fast, and I tried to keep the LED's in the green when boost was on, by changing
the different curves. This helped a lot in tuning of the system. I had 
problems with the weather changes and had to change the programs almost on
daily basis. As you can emagine this was a lot of fun but not very reliable
for daily commute. When I bought my 911, I slowly but surely lost my interest in
the Supra and turned to the 911. I sold the Supra. I am however planning on
buying another meter to keep an eye on my 3.2 engine. Will share with you the
results if interested.
PS: I would like to suggest using a fast reacting digital voltmeter otherwise
you will not get a real time reading. This is if someone wants to measure the O2
output like you did.

Yes, they do work. Yes it is as simple as it sounds. 

There are *THREE* cons:

1) fitment. If they unit you chose isn't an exact fit for the stock distributor,
   you're hosed since you can't "just use a 009" and keep the EFI.

2) wear. These gizmos are heavier than points, so will place extra wear 
   on the advance/retard mechanism in the distributor, the bushings on the
   distributor drive, and most of the other moving points. This may mean
   you get to replace or repair your distributor sooner than you might 
   otherwise, but it's not insurmountable.

3) repair. You can use Beetle points in a pinch if you have to, but where
   are you going to get a replacement ignitor in East Bummfuzzle if it
   "stops working"? Admittedly, this is not a *TYPICAL* problem, but
   I never seem to have those...

If you can live all that, the go for it!

I hate changing points too. In fact, I used to run magnetic trigger systems
driving CD ingitions on race cars in the '70s when that was *NOT* the way
that you were supposed to do it. I even have breakerless igntion on my
BMW motorcycle (you only *THINK* changing points on a 914 is a pain
in the ass...). And after my friend did his 356 (thanks to everyone who
forwarded info on 6 volt systems!), I'm seriously thinking about changing
Big Red over to breakerless...

If sheet metal, you can find U.S. spec stainless phillips head oval head

Subject: Re: alarm stickers...

Hey Sean,

In order to understand alarms and other theft deterrents you must understand 
the theory behind them.  First of all, theft (car or stereo) is obviously 
illegal.  Thus, the object of a thief is to do it and not get caught!  A 
thief will go to great lengths to steal a hot item, but he/she will *not* 
unnecessarily risk being caught to merely *FIND OUT* if there are valueables 
in a car.  In other words, a thief must have some knowledge that there is 
something in the car either by sight or prior knowledge.  It is for this 
reason that you *never* want to go Ba Ba Booming into a large parking lot 
with your windows down because potential thieves will be on the lookout.  
The moral of the story is that a "stealth" install is always your best first 
defense against having your car broken into.  A THIEF WON'T STEAL WHAT HE 
DOESN'T KNOW IS THERE!  Conceal your stereo equipment as much as possible.

Beyond the basic stealth installation, a good electronic security system is 
your best defense, aside of a steel vault garage.  Keep in mind that 
high-quality alarms do *not* make good first DIY projects.  They require 
significant specialized install knowledge, and considerable experience.  
Leave an alarm up to your trusted installer unless you *really* know what 
you are doing.  As I said before, to understand how an alarm works, you must 
understand the theory behind them.  An alarm does *not* offer any bona-fide 
physical barriers to a thief.  Instead, they do what a thief wants least, 
and that is draw attention.  The best alarm will not keep even the most 
amateur thief out of your car if their is no one around to hear it.  
Remember, just because your car has an alarm doesn't mean that it is a safe 
on wheels.  The stickers and LED's you mention can be thought of as 
"pre-warning" indicators.  Obviously, their purpose is to inform a would be 
thief that your car is armed, and generally he/she will move on to easier 
prey.  This approach is very effective.....most of the time, even if their 
is truly *no alarm at all*.  If you do have an aftermarket alarm installed, 
it will most likely come with its own stickers.  I recommend that you use 
them insted of the factory items!  Most factory alarms don't present much of 
a challenge to the average thief.  Purchase a *high-quality* aftermarket 
alarm made by a *reputable* manufacturer if you decide upon that route. This 
is not an area to pinch pennies because, ultimately, it is what stands 
between you and a thief.  Keep in mind, however, that even top dollar alarms 
won't keep out a determined, professional theif.  These guys have 
sophisticated methods and great experience in disabling most any alarm, and 
unfortunately P-cars, and nice systems are high on the want list ( *good* 
installation techniques help to minimize this).  The best way to protect 
your car is with common sense.  You must begin to think like a thief if you 
want to understand how to best protect your valueables.

Hope this helped.  Let me know if you need more info.

	When I worked in a Porsche Dealer here in upstate NY I witnessed 
what I thought was a deplorable practice by a factory autorized dealer.  
A brand spanking new 968 was taken out by a salesman (I think. Nobody 
would say who or how) and it came back with a failed timing and spur 
belts.  The damage was terrible.  There was nothing left of either belt 
except dust.  The valves were bent as well.  The car was repaired without 
cheaking for other engine damage and put right back on the showroom floor 
and sold as new.  So much for dealer quality service.

Please no flames. There seems to be a little tension on the net lately. I'm 
merely playing counterpoint since everyone else seems to love the Valentine.

Luther, I own the Bel 615STiR (remote). It supports X, K, Ka, superwideband 
Ka, laser and has detection avoidance. I choose the remote because I drive 
through states where radars are illegal and if I understand the law 
correctly, they can ticket you if the radar is in the passanger compartment 
of the car (even if it's not on) but not if it's remote and your'e 
registered in a radar tolerant state.

Bel also makes a portable version with the same features. I have owned Bel 
radars since 1986 and have no complaints (or proof that they're better or 
worse than any other).

Also, someone stated that the lower remote mount does not have the distance 
of a higher portable. Physics tells me that 3 feet over 2800ft (1/2 mile) 
only gives a marginal, if any real, gain and since we don't live in a 
perfect world, the bouncing of radar signals should find any detector as 
long as it's facing the correct direction (stated for simplicity). I could 
be wrong.

I don't think that the Mini was the first transverse engine front
wheel drive car.  The Berkeley preceeded it by at least three years
and there may have been others.  Berkeleys were made in Biggleswade,
England.

The Berkeley was 725 pounds of open sports car built with unit
construction in fiberglass with aluminum stiffeners.  The original
Lotus Elan is the only other car that I know of that used this
construction (not to be confused with later cars called Elan)

The Berkeley is properlay air-cooled (no nasty fluids) and dispenses
with any cooling fans.  The air cooled engine came in a 328 cc twin
and a 492 cc three-cylinder .. both two strokes.  In 1959, they also
used a Royal Enfield 700 cc four-stroke, but few of those were
produced.

I still have my original Berkeley purchased in 1959.  It doesn't
rust!   (:-)

Larry,

Thank you very much for the info. This is something I have always wondered
about but few people could answer. I have an '84 944 and have often thought
about a performance chip upgrade, except that for the '84 , it's a bit
expensive. Do you know if the performance mod for the '84 could be user
installed (I am well versed in logic board repairs and can do the work
provided there is no surface mount technology on the board, and I wouldn't
think there would be in an '84 ...).

In any case, if I was able to do the labour myself, do you think I could
scam the upgrade for a better price ?

Sorry to bother you about this, but any help would really be appericiated !!!!

Subject: 944 air flow meter problem ???

Alright, I think I'm figuring this out.

Over the past few months I have had problems with intermittant studdering
on my '84 944. Up until last night, the problem was too intermittant to
track down, but it has been happening more and I think it is in the air
flow meter. Could the barn door be sticking? Here are the symptoms of my
problem:

        a) car cuts out very sharply from time to time. Usually a change in
accel pedal pressure will solve the problem. Sometimes if I press down on
the accelerator the car will stumble or stall. When it is really bad, I
find that if I carfully find one position to hold the accelerator with my
foot the car will run smooth, but if I press down or back off the least
little bit the car will stumble or stall. This is the reason I feel it is
the air flow meter (if the barn door is sticking then the car can't tell
how much air it's getting and either runs too rich or lean to the point of
stalling).

        b) most commly happens in colder weather (it was well below zero
here in Wi. last night), but it can happen with the engine hot or cold.

        c) happens at idle, part throttle, and full throttle.

        d) I have checked all electrical connections concerning the dme and
fuel management.

        e) this morning it was still a bit of a problem so I tapped on top
of the air flow meter and the problem went away for a little while.

If any of you 944 experts know what this problem could be (could it be the
air flow meter, or am I on glue ???), could you please let me know, cause
I'm kind of stumped here.

***** NOTE *****

The first person who correctly dignoses my problem will recieve a free cd
of their choice from Narada records (a nice New Age/Jazz/World Music record
label). If this kind of music does not interest you, then you at least have
a cd to trade in at a used cd store for something you want !!!

Subject: Re: Subwoofers

Ryan,

You presented some info. regarding stereo's, but I feel that it needs some 
clarification for both yourself and others.

First of all, that is a pretty bold statement as to what the "Best Sounding" 
stereo equipment is out there when you consider that stereo sound is 
entirely subjective, and everyone has slightly different tastes.  For your 
information, *WaveGuide* tweeters are a brand name of horn-loaded 
compression drivers sold under the USD label by Speaker Works.  They are 
quite sophisticated and unconventional, and they go for about **$1500** not 
$170 as you mentioned.  There are other horn-loaded compression drivers on 
the market closer to that price, but most do not contain the exotic 
construction of the WaveGuide brand.   There are different schools of 
thought regarding the sound of horn-loaded drivers.  Many, such as you, find 
them to sound incredible, but others (including myself) characterize some 
such drivers as sounding "overly-bright", and horn-drivers have a frequent 
tendency to beam.  Likewise, it is entirely possible to create an accurate 
soundstage, and proper imaging with the use of more common cone or dome 
style tweeters and mid-range drivers.  My point is that not everyone views 
sound in the same way, and what sounds good to you may not sound good to others.

In regard to your comment of the "Ultimate Install", I disagree.  It is true 
that servo controlled sub-woofers usually exhibit extended capabilities, but 
they are not for everyone, and they are extremely rare in the auto 
environment.  It is not true that one servo controlled sub will necessarily 
"do as much" as 4 10" regular subs.  A competant installer with experience 
designing sub-woofer enclosures could build a sub-box with performance equal 
to or exceeding that of some servo controlled designs.  You are correct in 
saying that servo designs are *often*  "clear down to 20Hz or lower", and 
that is clearly a function of their servo-controlled correction circuits 
minimizing driver output distortion.  It is not, however, impossible or 
unheard of to obtain flat frequency response down to 20Hz or below using 
conventional non-servo drivers.  Once again, it is all dependant upon the 
proper enclosure design. Servo controlled subs do generally offer 
exceptional accuracy, but they are generally more expensive than 
conventional designs, as you mentioned.  

You also comment "you only need about 100W of power and it will be plenty".  
Plenty for what?  This may or may not necessarily be true.  I assume that 
you mean plenty of power for high output levels.  Output level, however, is 
a function of a driver's sensitivity (among other factors), and high 
sensitivity ratings are commonly found amongst conventional non-servo 
drivers and non-compression drivers as well.  Careful examination of a 
speaker's specs can offer many keys to how well a particular driver may 
perform in a proper enclosure.  Likewise, there is more to "good" sound than 
"about 100W of power".  Any particular amp must be evaluated on specs beyond 
raw power output.  Distorition level, dynamic headroom, RMS power ratings, 
etc. are all factors in describing the capabilities of an amplifier.  

For most people, it takes a great deal more than simply a pair of WaveGuide 
tweeters, a servo sub, and "about 100W of power" to create the "Ultimate 
System", as you suggested.  There are numerous variables that must be 
considered in the installation of a high-fidelity sound system in an 
automobile.  Equipment selection is only half the battle in auto-sound 
systems.  The difficult part is to implement that equipment into the car in 
a way that is asthetically pleasing, safe, and most importantly, offers the 
best possible sound suited to that individuals tastes.  Not necessarily an 
easy task!

Subject: My 944 alarm


I've got an Alpine alarm installed in my '86 944. As well as having the
usual door switch sensors, it emits a radar field surrounding the car. The
scope of this field is fully adjustable to 15 levels. If someone intrudes
the outer radar field, the alarm gives several warning chirps.  Inside the
car is a separate inner radar field. If this field is invaded, the alarm
goes off (i.e. if you stick your hand in an open window). The alarm has
outputs for activating other devices when the alarm is triggered. I've
connected a bright amber strobe light (shaped like the police ghost car
ones) using a black coil cord which goes in the dash. When parked, I can 
hang the light over the mirror so it is highly visible. I've had no 
problems with this setup so far.
 
Hmmm, just once it would be cool to clear traffic by turning on the alarm 
siren and putting the strobe light on the dash :^)

Subject: Re: Alarm stickers... 



Just a few words about the `Alarm stickers' thread:


1/   You can easilly install a fake flashing light.  It's *cheap* ($2).  Mine
is connected to the `always' 12V and the `only-when-running' 12V.  So it flashes
when I cut the motor and stops to flash when I start it.  When you'll connected
it, if it doesn't work, swap the 2 wires.  Flashing lights are diods.

You'll *never* forget it and it won't disturb you when driving in the middle of
the night.

One good location is obviously close to the radio head-unit.  If someone give a
look to your car, he will see it because he's wondering if there's any $$$ CD
player to still.

One other good location is close to the side-glass.  On your both driver and
passenger door, just near the little stick showing if the door is locked or not
(Can someone mail me the english word for it ?)

2/  Metal clubs are good protections too.  It's cheap and everyone knows it'll
take a minute or 2 to remove.

3/  If you install fake alarm stickers (you use stickers but you don't have any
alarm), ask for real stickers !  The ones they sell with the flashing lights are
too lousy to be real !

4/  My opinion is that your goal is to show the burglar that there are many
other cars to break into than yours. 

If someone really wants to attack your car, don't doubt he will do it.  The
protection is to prevent him to try.  After it's too late.


I tought it was forbidden in the states (and in Canada too) too let anything
noticeable in a car.  Is it true ?

This would be a great idea if people takes this habit in France.  Here, cars look
like shops.  You'll see CD players removable but not removed, coats, phones, ...

It only happens at low revs and in second gear. It sounds like the

other gears or at speed, no rattle.

MYSTERY SOLVED....
Thanks for all the suggestions but the solution was even stranger than
I thought.

My car has rear seatbelts fitted and the lower anchor point is secured
by a bolt that protrudes into the central tunnel. The bolt that was
used was too long and the gear linkage was vibrating against the bolt
in second.

Why not planning to visit the Mercedes-Benz factory too ?

I have booked for the visit in the morning of May, the 8th.

As can seen, when cam's  lift is 8 mm, head gives best performance.
Solex's pre-atomizer or venturi (I'm not quit sure for terms) and
intake valve reduces head flow a lot.

Subject: My 944 alarm


I've got an Alpine alarm installed in my '86 944. As well as having the
usual door switch sensors, it emits a radar field surrounding the car. The
scope of this field is fully adjustable to 15 levels. If someone intrudes
the outer radar field, the alarm gives several warning chirps.  Inside the
car is a separate inner radar field. If this field is invaded, the alarm
goes off (i.e. if you stick your hand in an open window). The alarm has
outputs for activating other devices when the alarm is triggered. I've
connected a bright amber strobe light (shaped like the police ghost car
ones) using a black coil cord which goes in the dash. When parked, I can 
hang the light over the mirror so it is highly visible. I've had no 
problems with this setup so far.
 
Hmmm, just once it would be cool to clear traffic by turning on the alarm 
siren and putting the strobe light on the dash :^)

Subject: Re: Alarm stickers... 



Just a few words about the `Alarm stickers' thread:


1/   You can easilly install a fake flashing light.  It's *cheap* ($2).  Mine
is connected to the `always' 12V and the `only-when-running' 12V.  So it flashes
when I cut the motor and stops to flash when I start it.  When you'll connected
it, if it doesn't work, swap the 2 wires.  Flashing lights are diods.

You'll *never* forget it and it won't disturb you when driving in the middle of
the night.

One good location is obviously close to the radio head-unit.  If someone give a
look to your car, he will see it because he's wondering if there's any $$$ CD
player to still.

One other good location is close to the side-glass.  On your both driver and
passenger door, just near the little stick showing if the door is locked or not
(Can someone mail me the english word for it ?)

2/  Metal clubs are good protections too.  It's cheap and everyone knows it'll
take a minute or 2 to remove.

3/  If you install fake alarm stickers (you use stickers but you don't have any
alarm), ask for real stickers !  The ones they sell with the flashing lights are
too lousy to be real !

4/  My opinion is that your goal is to show the burglar that there are many
other cars to break into than yours. 

If someone really wants to attack your car, don't doubt he will do it.  The
protection is to prevent him to try.  After it's too late.


I tought it was forbidden in the states (and in Canada too) too let anything
noticeable in a car.  Is it true ?

This would be a great idea if people takes this habit in France.  Here, cars look
like shops.  You'll see CD players removable but not removed, coats, phones, ...

Hi there
My '87 924s has just developed a rather disturbing rattle in the rear.
It only happens at low revs and in second gear. It sounds like the
gear linkage is hitting the bodywork or something else. In all the
other gears or at speed, no rattle.

MYSTERY SOLVED....
Thanks for all the suggestions but the solution was even stranger than
I thought.

My car has rear seatbelts fitted and the lower anchor point is secured
by a bolt that protrudes into the central tunnel. The bolt that was
used was too long and the gear linkage was vibrating against the bolt
in second.

Thanks to the poor mechanic who sat in the back while I drove around
in second gear for twenty minutes while he tapped, prodded and poked
untill this discovery.

Subject: 84 Carrera oil press. light prob

Hopefully someone can give me a meaningful answer about 
oil pressure and other  problems I started having this morning.

The outside air temp was as low as 15*f. this morning when I started
the engine. I noticed the oil level gauge was in the red but I had good
oil pressure. I stopped and checked the oil level and found it to be
between the hi and low marks. I also have had the oil pressure light
dimly glowing.   As the engine warmed, the oil level indicator moved
into the middle range of the gauge. 

As I drove the car about 40 miles with no unusual occurances.

On the way home after dark, lights on, heater fan running , the lights
began to dim.  The engine started running rough and I had to pull over.  I
went to an autoparts store, purchased a new battery and continued home
without futher problems. 

I wonder if someone could have switched the lights, plugging the alt.
light in the oil light recepticle and visa versa. 

That would not explain the oil level gauge problem I had.

Any help would be appreciated.

On the other hand, I got only the master key for my '84. It fits both doors,
the hatch, and the ignition. It activates and de-activates the alarm from
the passenger door and the hatch, but not the driver door - I assume that
the switch there has gone bad. The wires that connect the switch in the
door across the hinge to the body are in a separate harness, which makes
me think the alarm is an option; incidentally that makes a convenient

The response continues to be gratifying.  By Tuesday AM, there have been 85
people who indicated willingness to chip in to help Stan be able to keep his
914 racecar.

We readers of porschephiles have all gotten much benefit out of the list -- at
no cost to us, but at the cost of lots of Stan's time.  Now we can help him
out by contributing a very small amount, $15, so he can afford to keep his
pride&joy.

Send me a message (fhp@unipress.com) if you're willing to contribute. Read
the details below.


++++ MY ORIGINAL MESSAGE ++++++++++++++

I think that the person who suggested that we porschephiles
contribute to buy Stan's 914 racecar for Stan had a very good idea.


Here's my thought:

There are about 500 people on the list (More, I think. I haven't kept the
recent listing of all the names.)

Stan wants $7000 for his car. 

This works out to approx $10-$15 per person.  We have each SURELY gotten this
much value and enjoyment out of pfiles.

SO -- Here's my suggestion:

Each person willing to donate $15 (or more!) should send me an email
off-line, stating his email and willingness to contribute $15. If I get a
critical mass of these I'll let everyone know and the pledgees can actually
make their donations.


		     SEND ME THESE EMAILS BY FEB 11 !!!

If too Few sign up, the idea is a Did Not Start. If Many sign up it's a Go.
If Very Many sign up, the rate per person goes down.

I'll let everyone know the results by Feb 15.

OK???

The key in the hatch lid is a mechanical release, at least on the '84.
It does not cause the motor to run. The motor operates on the other
side of the latch mechanism. That is, there are two overlapping
pieces which hold the hatch closed, and if either one retracts, the
hatch can open. The hatch key retracts one, the hatch motor the
other.

As I recall, the hatch motor won't run unless a door is open, presumably
as a safety measure to keep curious fingers from popping the hatch at
speed. Do your interior lights come on when you open the door? If not,
that's the thing to fix first. Beyond that, the motor is right behind
the removable panel that holds tools - look for voltage there and
work your way back - the pull-switches are easily accessible also.
I guess the first thing to figure out is why the mechanical release
doesn't work - fixing that may be all you want or need anyway, since
the electrical release is neither reliable or very useful.

perhaps they *can* do this, but why bother?  is laser speed detection works
via doppler (on the modulation, not on the .. uhh .. blue shift), it's pretty
likely that the modulation does not exceed a few MHz.

laser diodes are plenty fast, and in the controlled environment of fiber
communications, the pin diodes and surrounding circuitry can be too, but
through the air ir detection with ambient light et al means you're basically
going for max gain in a narrow bandwidth.  detecting a few nA in all that
noise is hard enough without repeating the microwave shit that lasers and
the non-intervention of the fcc give you for free with light.

but this is all smoke.  call mike valentine - he's always willing to chat,

The restorers guide to Authenticity (?) app. $ 25      (for 356 series)

Join the 356 registry.

I would recommend buying a T-6 model as first car, then you're left

The T-6 is perhaps the easiest and 'cheapest' 356 to restore, more parts on the market. 
They are also more comfortable drivers, and have had less years to

long waveguide that is pumped by 256 1 megawatt klystrons (microwave tubes).  When they 
fire, it up an inmmensely powerful microwave pulse travels the length of the device.
At the starting end a bunch of electrons is injected, and gets caught in the "trough" 
between two cycles of the microwave radiation.  The electrons ride along there, (technically,
"surfing" the wavefront), and are accelerated to near the speed of light.  According to the 
tour guide, the electrons (which, unlike a laser pulse, actually have mass) hit 99% of the 
speed of light in the first 10 feet.  The remaining length of the accelerator is to get them 
up to 99.999999 or so percent.  I remember thinking what a kick that must be, and what it 
would be like to ride one of those electrons.  0 to 667,000,000 MPH in 10 feet!

There.  Now I'm geek of the week!

Subject: 944 Power Steering Hose Leaks


There have been several items on 944 power steering hose leakage
lately.  This seems to be a chronic problem with 944s and I have
not been spared.

The first thing I tried to staunch the flow was change out the
original hose clamps for the improved version - I forget the numbers
but they are available from your friendly Porsche dealer.  This
sufficed for awhile but recently the flow turned into a mini torrent.

I thought I might be able to pull the hoses, trim them a bit to get
to 'fresh' rubber and reinstall.  Alas, the hopes of the terminally
naive!  The hose to the cooler went back on OK but the hose which
runs to the pump disintegrated.  At this point (Sunday afternoon,
no P-parts places open and car needed to get to place of employment
the next day) I got desparate and took a piece of heavy wall Tygon
tubing which I think had about a 1/2" ID and installed it in place
of the dearly departed hose.  Anyway, it fit and best of all it does
not leak whatever!  Since it is more flexible than the original I
took extra care in routing it so that it would not contact anything
it is not supposed to.

I did this replacement as an emergency measure but seems to be
working so well I may keep it.  Folks at work here don't think there
should be any material incompatibility problem and the temperatures
are withing the Tygon's spec range.  Anyone out there in 'Phile
land know whether I am courting disaster?

Hi, Bob.
I found your post on using the oxygen sensor (Lambda sensor as the Germans
call it) interesting. If you are worried about bandwidth, please post any
other details you have to my E-mail box. I'd like to fiddle around with one
on my 356 (which I think is congenitally rich, "they all do that.") In
particular, when rejetting the thing to run with velocity stacks, it leans
out at high rpm, so getting a number would be interesting. I think I can
patch an O2 sensor into an analog port of my road test equipment and record
time, speed, distance, accleration, rpm, and now (sort of) air-fuel ratio.
See exactly where the jets are falling down, and how much.

No flames intended, Arthur, but my own personal experience says that the
mounting height of a radar detector makes a huge difference in detector
range. A few years ago I was involved in testing various brands of detectors
(including the new Valentine One) as a subcontractor to a consultant working
for the association of radar detector manufacturers. Their organization,
RADAR, paid for the testing to quantify some numbers. We had two or three
randomly bought examples of each model to choose from. We tested on a flat,
straight, 4-mile-long desert road (yes, the famous Mrs. Orcutt's Driveway).
I don't have the numbers handy, but in all cases, mounting the detector at the
top of the windshield gave a much longer range than having it on top of the
dash. Maybe 50%, maybe even 100 percent longer? I don't recall exactly, but
it was significant. Mounting it down low, maybe as a fake foglight, will
make it even worse. When dealing with instant-on radar, you want to detect
enemy radar <g> when he is shooting at traffic ahead of you, intermittently.
If your range is significantly shortened by poor mounting location, you may
be in his sights without having detected his earlier shots.

Subject: RE: 944 air flow meter problem ???


Trev,

Could very well be your problem.  The air flow meters do go bad.  Their
are two failure modes I am familiar with:

1. The barn door hangs up,
2. The metering resistive element fails (wears through).

You can check #1 roughly by removing the inlet side boot and manipulating
the barn door with your fingers.  However, your fingers are a little 
different
from air (detailed explanation available upon request), and I would also
do the following.

Hook up a voltmeter across two pins of the air flow meter cable, but with
it nonetheless fully hooked up.  I forget which two, and they probably 
depend
on your model and year anyways.  With the engine off but the electrics
otherwise on, sweep the barn door from closed to WOT and back a few
times.  Look for a progressive and smooth output signal, no jumps or
spikes.  This tests #2.  I forget the correct min and max voltages.  They
are in the manual; however I don't think you need to know them for the
problem at hand.

Now run the engine.  At the throttle cam, manipulate it to bring the engine
up from idle to high RPM, then down, and do this a few times.  You are again
looking for smooth continuous changes, indicating both that the resistive
element is OK and that induced air is able to move the barn door freely.

I find it easiest to pop the black plastic lid off the air flow meter and 
hook the
voltmeter up on the inside of the connector.  This also lets me observe the
sweep of the armature, and visually inspect the condition of the resistive
element.  However, some cars mount the AFM "upside down," making
access to the lid difficult.  (I think the 944S2 is this way.)

If the resistive element is pitted or worn, you may be able to eke a little 
more
life out of it by relocating the swept arm's contacts a little in or out, 
radially.
This is done by changing the bend of the sweeping arm a tad.

BTW, perhaps it is my own incompetence or misunderstanding.  But I have
never been able to get a useful impedence sweep from an AFM.  That is,
unplugging it and hooking an ohmmeter across the contacts doesn't seem
to work.  You have to hook it up, turn on the electrics, and use a 
voltmeter.
No idea why, but this is what the factory manuals tell you to do.

Realistically, though, if your AFM is bad, buy a new used one from George
Beuselinck at 944 Ecology.  You do not want to know what a new one costs
from PCNA, believe me.  There are plenty of good used ones out there, and
that is certainly the route I would follow.

Hope this helps.

Jeff,  I'm just catching up on some mail after a business trip...

Use the notch-tooth style trigger wheel.  I started off with the saw-tooth
style and had countless plug fouling problems.  the notch-tooth style wheel
solved this AND seems to have given smoother overall power.

Set advance and rev. limiter *ONLY* with a timing light and accurate tach.
 the indicators on the pots are way off on mine (this may be obvious to
you).

The rev-limiter is extremely smooth at cut-out and it's great that it's so
easy to adjust -- at last year's Pro Solo Finale there was a short chute
that we ran the top of 2nd thru, we were hitting the rev limiter mid way
thru and there was a hard turn right after it (wasn't worth a shift).  We
found we were subconsciously backing off the throttle and loosing some time
 -- so I just bumped the limiter up a few hundred rpm and it worked great]
 Talking to a 911 co-competitor, Rex Carle, who runs a Motronic/Mass flow
set up, they were either having to shift or run thru slower in 2nd...

Good luck]

Hopefully someone can give me a meaningful answer about 
oil pressure and other  problems I started having this morning.

The outside air temp was as low as 15*f. this morning when I started
the engine. I noticed the oil level gauge was in the red but I had good
oil pressure. I stopped and checked the oil level and found it to be
between the hi and low marks. I also have had the oil pressure light
dimly glowing.   As the engine warmed, the oil level indicator moved
into the middle range of the gauge. 

As I drove the car about 40 miles with no unusual occurances.

On the way home after dark, lights on, heater fan running , the lights
began to dim.  The engine started running rough and I had to pull over.  I
went to an autoparts store, purchased a new battery and continued home
without futher problems. 

I wonder if someone could have switched the lights, plugging the alt.
light in the oil light recepticle and visa versa. 

That would not explain the oil level gauge problem I had.

Any help would be appreciated.

On the other hand, I got only the master key for my '84. It fits both doors,

The response continues to be gratifying.  By Tuesday AM, there have been 85

We readers of porschephiles have all gotten much benefit out of the list -- at
no cost to us, but at the cost of lots of Stan's time.  Now we can help him
out by contributing a very small amount, $15, so he can afford to keep his
pride&joy.

Send me a message (fhp@unipress.com) if you're willing to contribute. Read
the details below.


++++ MY ORIGINAL MESSAGE ++++++++++++++

I think that the person who suggested that we porschephiles
contribute to buy Stan's 914 racecar for Stan had a very good idea.


Here's my thought:

There are about 500 people on the list (More, I think. I haven't kept the
recent listing of all the names.)

Stan wants $7000 for his car. 

This works out to approx $10-$15 per person.  We have each SURELY gotten this
much value and enjoyment out of pfiles.

SO -- Here's my suggestion:

Each person willing to donate $15 (or more!) should send me an email
off-line, stating his email and willingness to contribute $15. If I get a
critical mass of these I'll let everyone know and the pledgees can actually
make their donations.


		     SEND ME THESE EMAILS BY FEB 11 !!!

If too Few sign up, the idea is a Did Not Start. If Many sign up it's a Go.
If Very Many sign up, the rate per person goes down.

I'll let everyone know the results by Feb 15.

The key in the hatch lid is a mechanical release, at least on the '84.
It does not cause the motor to run. The motor operates on the other
side of the latch mechanism. That is, there are two overlapping
pieces which hold the hatch closed, and if either one retracts, the
hatch can open. The hatch key retracts one, the hatch motor the
other.

As I recall, the hatch motor won't run unless a door is open, presumably
as a safety measure to keep curious fingers from popping the hatch at
speed. Do your interior lights come on when you open the door? If not,
that's the thing to fix first. Beyond that, the motor is right behind
the removable panel that holds tools - look for voltage there and
work your way back - the pull-switches are easily accessible also.
I guess the first thing to figure out is why the mechanical release
doesn't work - fixing that may be all you want or need anyway, since
the electrical release is neither reliable or very useful.

perhaps they *can* do this, but why bother?  is laser speed detection works
via doppler (on the modulation, not on the .. uhh .. blue shift), it's pretty
likely that the modulation does not exceed a few MHz.

laser diodes are plenty fast, and in the controlled environment of fiber
communications, the pin diodes and surrounding circuitry can be too, but
through the air ir detection with ambient light et al means you're basically
going for max gain in a narrow bandwidth.  detecting a few nA in all that
noise is hard enough without repeating the microwave shit that lasers and
the non-intervention of the fcc give you for free with light.

away because all the cars are within inches of each other--and you!

I experienced  a similar problem several years back and found that the clamps
on the big black intake hose mounted on the back of the meter unit we loose
and were leaking air into the system.

A change of accelerator pressure can cause the motor to move on its mounts
opening or closing the air gap if the hose is loose

I once toured the Stanford Linear Accelerator in Palo Alto.  This is basically a 1/4 mile 
long waveguide that is pumped by 256 1 megawatt klystrons (microwave tubes).  When they 
fire, it up an inmmensely powerful microwave pulse travels the length of the device.
At the starting end a bunch of electrons is injected, and gets caught in the "trough" 
between two cycles of the microwave radiation.  The electrons ride along there, (technically,
"surfing" the wavefront), and are accelerated to near the speed of light.  According to the 
tour guide, the electrons (which, unlike a laser pulse, actually have mass) hit 99% of the 
speed of light in the first 10 feet.  The remaining length of the accelerator is to get them 
up to 99.999999 or so percent.  I remember thinking what a kick that must be, and what it 
would be like to ride one of those electrons.  0 to 667,000,000 MPH in 10 feet!

There.  Now I'm geek of the week!

Subject: 944 Power Steering Hose Leaks


There have been several items on 944 power steering hose leakage
lately.  This seems to be a chronic problem with 944s and I have
not been spared.

The first thing I tried to staunch the flow was change out the
original hose clamps for the improved version - I forget the numbers
but they are available from your friendly Porsche dealer.  This
sufficed for awhile but recently the flow turned into a mini torrent.

I thought I might be able to pull the hoses, trim them a bit to get
to 'fresh' rubber and reinstall.  Alas, the hopes of the terminally
naive!  The hose to the cooler went back on OK but the hose which
runs to the pump disintegrated.  At this point (Sunday afternoon,
no P-parts places open and car needed to get to place of employment
the next day) I got desparate and took a piece of heavy wall Tygon
tubing which I think had about a 1/2" ID and installed it in place
of the dearly departed hose.  Anyway, it fit and best of all it does
not leak whatever!  Since it is more flexible than the original I
took extra care in routing it so that it would not contact anything
it is not supposed to.

I did this replacement as an emergency measure but seems to be
working so well I may keep it.  Folks at work here don't think there
should be any material incompatibility problem and the temperatures
are withing the Tygon's spec range.  Anyone out there in 'Phile
land know whether I am courting disaster?

Hi, Bob.
I found your post on using the oxygen sensor (Lambda sensor as the Germans
call it) interesting. If you are worried about bandwidth, please post any
other details you have to my E-mail box. I'd like to fiddle around with one
on my 356 (which I think is congenitally rich, "they all do that.") In
particular, when rejetting the thing to run with velocity stacks, it leans
out at high rpm, so getting a number would be interesting. I think I can
patch an O2 sensor into an analog port of my road test equipment and record
time, speed, distance, accleration, rpm, and now (sort of) air-fuel ratio.
See exactly where the jets are falling down, and how much.

No flames intended, Arthur, but my own personal experience says that the
mounting height of a radar detector makes a huge difference in detector
range. A few years ago I was involved in testing various brands of detectors
(including the new Valentine One) as a subcontractor to a consultant working
for the association of radar detector manufacturers. Their organization,
RADAR, paid for the testing to quantify some numbers. We had two or three
randomly bought examples of each model to choose from. We tested on a flat,
straight, 4-mile-long desert road (yes, the famous Mrs. Orcutt's Driveway).
I don't have the numbers handy, but in all cases, mounting the detector at the
top of the windshield gave a much longer range than having it on top of the
dash. Maybe 50%, maybe even 100 percent longer? I don't recall exactly, but
it was significant. Mounting it down low, maybe as a fake foglight, will
make it even worse. When dealing with instant-on radar, you want to detect
enemy radar <g> when he is shooting at traffic ahead of you, intermittently.
If your range is significantly shortened by poor mounting location, you may
be in his sights without having detected his earlier shots.

Subject: RE: 944 air flow meter problem ???


Trev,

Could very well be your problem.  The air flow meters do go bad.  Their
are two failure modes I am familiar with:

1. The barn door hangs up,
2. The metering resistive element fails (wears through).

You can check #1 roughly by removing the inlet side boot and manipulating
the barn door with your fingers.  However, your fingers are a little 
different
from air (detailed explanation available upon request), and I would also
do the following.

Hook up a voltmeter across two pins of the air flow meter cable, but with
it nonetheless fully hooked up.  I forget which two, and they probably 
depend
on your model and year anyways.  With the engine off but the electrics
otherwise on, sweep the barn door from closed to WOT and back a few
times.  Look for a progressive and smooth output signal, no jumps or
spikes.  This tests #2.  I forget the correct min and max voltages.  They
are in the manual; however I don't think you need to know them for the
problem at hand.

Now run the engine.  At the throttle cam, manipulate it to bring the engine
up from idle to high RPM, then down, and do this a few times.  You are again
looking for smooth continuous changes, indicating both that the resistive
element is OK and that induced air is able to move the barn door freely.

I find it easiest to pop the black plastic lid off the air flow meter and 
hook the
voltmeter up on the inside of the connector.  This also lets me observe the
sweep of the armature, and visually inspect the condition of the resistive
element.  However, some cars mount the AFM "upside down," making
access to the lid difficult.  (I think the 944S2 is this way.)

If the resistive element is pitted or worn, you may be able to eke a little 
more
life out of it by relocating the swept arm's contacts a little in or out, 
radially.
This is done by changing the bend of the sweeping arm a tad.

BTW, perhaps it is my own incompetence or misunderstanding.  But I have
never been able to get a useful impedence sweep from an AFM.  That is,
unplugging it and hooking an ohmmeter across the contacts doesn't seem
to work.  You have to hook it up, turn on the electrics, and use a 
voltmeter.
No idea why, but this is what the factory manuals tell you to do.

Realistically, though, if your AFM is bad, buy a new used one from George
Beuselinck at 944 Ecology.  You do not want to know what a new one costs
from PCNA, believe me.  There are plenty of good used ones out there, and
that is certainly the route I would follow.

Hope this helps.

solved this AND seems to have given smoother overall power.

Set advance and rev. limiter *ONLY* with a timing light and accurate tach.
 the indicators on the pots are way off on mine (this may be obvious to

The rev-limiter is extremely smooth at cut-out and it's great that it's so
easy to adjust -- at last year's Pro Solo Finale there was a short chute
that we ran the top of 2nd thru, we were hitting the rev limiter mid way
thru and there was a hard turn right after it (wasn't worth a shift).  We
found we were subconsciously backing off the throttle and loosing some time
 -- so I just bumped the limiter up a few hundred rpm and it worked great]
 Talking to a 911 co-competitor, Rex Carle, who runs a Motronic/Mass flow
set up, they were either having to shift or run thru slower in 2nd...

Good luck]

The purpose of the survey is to collect maintence and repair records for the 
924/944/968 series. I am including a form to make data input easier for you.
I am not sure what the final format will, but I will get a better idea when I
recieve your input. A comments section will appear at the end of the form for
any additional information you can provide. When completed, it make for some
interested reading, for those who may have a common problem, or would just
like to hear other owners comments and problems, without having to search all
the past archives.

  The more info I recieve the more accurate the survey. Please try to
help if you can. This would be a great addition to the FAQ!

Once I have the compilied the past section of the owners survey, I will
update the the owners report from time to time. This will then be posted
to the FAQ.

The completed form can be sent to me directly for review. DO NOT SEND TO
ENTIRE LIST!!

I was thinking that a mileage format would be a good idea ( repairs and 
maintance list by mileage, and a topic, format ie. Waterpumps, motor mounts, 
clutches etc. Any comments, let me know.

Dear Mike,

You wrote:

I have the most puzzling problem.  Here are the symptoms:

After the car warms up, the idle will drop to a very low rate, about
300RPM.  It'll then promptly return to about 1000RPM.  The 300 lasts
for about a second, and the 1000 RPM lasts for about 5 or
so seconds.  The process is repeated until the car just quits and 
stalls.  It is semi-periodic, and the intervals seem almost constant
for each period.

I can notice, when the idle drops, that bubbles in the return
fuel line cease to move, they stagnate in the return fuel line.
Also, the voltage across the terminals on the fuel pump drops
slightly, but I suspect that this is due to the stress on the
alternator from the low idle state.

The car is a 1973 914/4 1.7L.

The fuel pump is a (new) refurbished unit, and I have a new head temperature
sensor as well.

Do you have any idea what this could be caused by?  I'm about to place
an order for other stuff to Auto Atlanta, and would like to pick
up any parts that could help remedy this problem.  BTW, some sleaze-
ball stole the Wolfsberg emblem from the front of the car.  Do you
sell those (couldn't find them in the catalog)?


Thanks for any help,


It sounds like you have an intermittant miss. This could be caused obviously
by a number of things. To test, remove and install all plug wires loosely in
the distibutor cap and then when the problem occurs, disconnect one wire at a
time noting which one does not make an idle difference. This is the cylinder
suspect. If diagonal cylinders are not firing, trigger points are suspect. If
two cylinders on one side are not firing, ground leads are suspect.

Check as well the charge rate at the battery terminals. It should be about
13.6. If it fluctuates radically (for example up to 15 volts), the voltage
regulator has failed and must immediately be replaced and the acid spill
around the battery area neutralized.

Finally, where is the Wolfsberg emblem located on a 914 other than a Euro
model steering wheel center horn pad? Inquiring minds want to know!

Josh,
Usually the front clunk when braking or bumping is caused by a 100SE front
strut. The nut insert loosens and the cartridge clunks as it moves up and
down. This can easily be solved by elevating the car, dropping the strut,
removing the cone cover and tightening the nut insert. This would also be a
good time to check the strut inserts for wear as worn out ones could also
clunk.

You all know you can't trust a dealer, right?

When the 944 Turbos first arrived in late 1985, the local dealer I did business 
with sold a friend of mine a new one. The next day he brought it to an autocross
and let me drive it. He said the front was a little stiffer than he expected.

I made 1/2 a lap and pulled off when I drove it. It wasn't just a little stiff,
it didn't move! I jacked the front of the car up to take a look. For shipment,
Porsche had installed a rubber collar that kept the front springs in the 
longest extension so the nose would clear transporter ramps, ship ramps, etc.

A pair of wire cutters and some tugging removed the collars and the car handled 
much better. A quick survey revealed that, of the 40 or so initially delivered
in Northern California, 25 were delivered with the collars still on the car.
Dave Colman received a Turbo for a road test with the collars still on. 

In deference to the dealers, only a handful had received any notification about
this and most of the prep groups figured it out themselves. 

Incidentally, I haven't seen the collars on any Concours 944 Turbos. This would 
truely be in "as-delivered" condition.

Well, I put the 911 back on the road. I ended up using JB Weld to patch 
the small hole that I put in the top of the cold-start air distribution
mainifold. I experimented with JB weld on some scrap aluminum. I even
baked it at 500C in the oven to see how it holds out. Man, that is 
tough stuff!! If the service is clean, the adhesion is really good. 
Anyways, I used a small piece of metal mesh and some JB Weld to form
a plug on top of the hole (The mesh is to prevent any small pieces breaking
off and getting ingested). I also used the JB Weld on the pop-off
valve. Great stuff.

The 911 is back on the road early because of my winter junker (82 civic)
tranny siezed solid at an intersection. I was nursing the tranny over the
last few months, but I thought that maybe I could get another month
out of it...guesss not. The weather in vancouver is really mild this year
(only froze a couple of times), and driving the p-car is a real blast.

The car has a subtle surge that you can feel most in the lower gears when
running at constant RPM or accelerating mildly to moderately up to about 5K
rpm, it also oscillates at idle when warmed up.  Under hard acceleration it
seems ok.  I loaded it up with a tank of Techron treated fuel and after 1/4
tank it got *worse*.  I then swapped out the O2 sensor with an old one I had
taken off our other Carrera (unknown if it's any good either), and after a
couple of miles it went back to it's "subtle" surge as before.  My question
before I shell out the $$s for a new sensor: are there other things I should
chase down first, or in parallel?  I have an O2 sensor off a low miles'88
motor that has a different plug end -- any problem if I just splice on the
plugs that'll work for my year?  There are three wires that go to the
sensor, I believe two are for preheat and one is the output; does it matter
how the two preheat ones are hooked up (hazardous if switched around)?

Next question:
The odometer has stopped reading, the speedo works tho.  Stan gave me the
name/address of a local VDO person, but I was wondering if anyone out there
has tried to debug one of these (electronic) units? Or even better yet, does
someone have one they'd like to sell?

Last question:
There is a cluster of 3 lights on the dash that consists of the Brake,
Seatbelt and a circle with little dashes around it.  Is this third one the
low-brake lining warning light?  It stays on all the time and I have checked
the pads -- plenty of pad left.  Since I over maintain things and don't need
the light to tell me my pads are worn, can I cut the wires at the pads to
turn it off ?(I doubt cool carbons will have the right sensor any way ;-))


Thanks in advance,

****SAY IT ISN'T SO****

I know sales for the water cooled models are below their air cooled

(well, successfully in the '80s).

Subject: Tranny Plug removal update..


I asked some questions about removing a **really** tight 915 drain plug
a while back. This is what happened:

1) The 17mm hex socket stripped out (It was already almost stripped..the
   previous mechanic should have replaced it!!)

2) I tried to use a chisel/hammer to start it to spin. No luck and cut 
   away some of the plug.

3) I used a dremel tool with a carbide bit to cut two slots across the plug,
   and used a solid steel dowel with a pin to try to unscrew it. No such
   luck, I sheared off the rest of the plug so it was pratically flush 
   with the bottom of the tranny.

Now things get serious...

4) I drilled two 1/8" holes through the plug opposite to each other inside
   the socket portion of the plug. I let that drain overnight.

5) I tried another steel dowl with 2 hardened steel pins protruding from the
   bottom of the dowel to unscrew the plug. No such luck, kept bending the pins.

7) Drilled a series of 1/8" holes around the inside of the plug, carefully keeping
   to the side to avoid the magnet at the center of the plug (I bought a new plug
   by then)

8) I then spent over an hour using the dremel tool to "hollow" out between the
   drill holes while carefully not going too deep to allow the shavings to get
   into the tranny.

9) I finially removed the center of the drain plug. The shavings that did get into 
   the tranny where attracted to the magnet that was still attatched to the center
   of the plug.

10) Another hour of grinding/filing to cut two grooves on each side of the cylndrical
    drain plug shell that was left in the tranny. Carefull not to grind down into the
    threads.

11) I partiall collasped the plug using a chisel/hammer. Plug would still not rotate.
    Grind some more...

12) Drove a 1/2 extention into the drain plug, and **finially** managed to start to 

    unscrew the plug....what a feeling!!!

13) Got the plug out. No damage to the threads on the tranny, and no sign of debris 
    in the tranny.

14) Fill the tranny with quakerstate gear oil, and license the car for a day, and 
    go about 50 miles

15) Return to the shop, drop the oil, and fill the tranny with Swepco. Complement 
    yourself on how nice that new drain plug is, and put the old drain plug on
    the wall as a momento.

All in all, serveral nights and lots of swearing just to change the tranny oil...
I wonder whats next?

Subject: Alarms and other deterrents...

One thing that I think is important when trying to deter theft, is to 
make sure the "would-be-thief" knows what he's up against BEFORE 
smashing your window.  There's nothing more frustrating than installing 
an alarm only to have the thief "double check" that the LED is really 
connected to an alarm brain.

Alpine (and I'm sure Clifford as well) offers an alarm with perimeter 
sensing.  Don't confuse this with those rediculous "talking alarms" 
which I'm convinced instigate more vandalism than they prevent.  "STEP 
BACK FROM THE CAR!"  Yeah, right!  What's you're average punk going to 
do when he hears that?!  The perimeter sensing I'm talking about is set 
for distances of about 1 foot around the car.  This detects a thief 
during the "peeking in the windows" phase of the crime, and lets out a 
single yelp from the siren and could flash the lights too.  This is 
enough to let them know that breaking in is probably more trouble than 
it's worth.

While I'm here, let me make a personal plea.  I know when you get an 
alarm system there's a temptation to set the motion/shock sensors to be 
very sensitive.  Yes you're alarm will go off and scare everyone 
initially, but after awhile you'll annoy everybody in your neighborhood 
and soon nobody (including yourself) will pay attention when something 
ACTUALLY happens.  And you can bet your neighbors won't be as helpful in 
watching out for your car if your alarm keeps waking them up in the 
middle of the night.

I'm sure Andy can help with current models that offer the "perimeter 
sensing" feature if anyone's interested...

Arthur Golden writes:

[Please no flames. There seems to be a little tension on the net lately. I'm 
merely playing counterpoint since everyone else seems to love the Valentine.

Luther, I own the Bel 615STiR (remote). It supports X, K, Ka, superwideband 
Ka, laser and has detection avoidance. I choose the remote because I drive 
through states where radars are illegal and if I understand the law 
correctly, they can ticket you if the radar is in the passanger compartment 
of the car (even if it's not on) but not if it's remote and your'e 
registered in a radar tolerant state.

Bel also makes a portable version with the same features. I have owned Bel 
radars since 1986 and have no complaints (or proof that they're better or 
worse than any other).

Also, someone stated that the lower remote mount does not have the distance 
of a higher portable. Physics tells me that 3 feet over 2800ft (1/2 mile) 
only gives a marginal, if any real, gain and since we don't live in a 
perfect world, the bouncing of radar signals should find any detector as 
long as it's facing the correct direction (stated for simplicity). I could 
be wrong.]

Arthur:  No flames intended here (not even a spark), but a couple of points 
for consideration:

In Virginia (where I live), the law states that radar detectors are illegal to 
"operate."  Courts have rules that having a detector in your car (windshield 
mounted or remote) is considered operation unless you can prove beyond all 
doubts that the unit could not have been operating (like no power cord 
attached).  Virginia State Troopers have been known to impound a car with a 
remote unit unless the owner could remove the detector on the spot.  One 
fellow PCA'r got out of a ticket by showing that no fuse was in the fuse 
holder of his remote detector (in fact, the fuse wire was a dummy.  He had a 
switch under the dash to shut off all power to the unit).

Second, every test of detectors that I have seen mentions mounting height as 
an important point.  Even a few feet apparently makes a difference.  Another 
concern about remote detectors is the fact that the antenna can become blocked 
by dirt (a real problem with laser).

I've owned a Bel unit and it's a good, well-made detector, which is why it 
nearly always finishes second in the comparisons.  The V1 usually finishes 
first.  It is just a better unit, IMHO.

>'72 911E

     Bob, I went home at lunch and opened mine up...as you might guess
  nothing very sophisticated in there, just one of those 50 Femtosecond
  pulsing lasers you see at Walgreens...

     :)  No, what I did find is this;
  1. The transducing element is _NOT_ a standard 02 sensor, but a
     center-tapped "wire" spring. One side of the spring is exposed
     to the Car gas, the other is carefully sealed (or, was carefully
     sealed until I took mine apart !) and probably just gets Oxygen.
  2. The main unit is probably a Wein Bridge, and contains a voltage
     regulator, a few diodes, and few passives, and the Meter movement.

  3. Does this really just test Oxygen and not CO ? I suppose yes, but
     according to Gunson's owner's manual they are essentially the same.
     CO is minimum at the lambda 14.7:1, and goes up as the mixture gets
     richer (their chart shows 8% CO at 12:1 mixture, the range of their
     gauge).

   4. As you mentioned, the Oxygen sensors available for cars are meant to
     work abruptly over a narrow range, according to the chart I have
     the output of the Oxygen sensor is about 600mv at 14.7:1, 200mv
     at 15.0:1 and  900mv at 14.5:1. Outside that range, the voltage/oxygen
     curve goes south and the curve gets asymptotic.  The air/fuel monitor
     from MSD is easy, as they just put a comparator at Lambda and pulse
     a "rich" or "Lean" led depending which side it falls on. The Edelbrock
     unit probably uses a string of comparators (to display 12:1 to 15:1
     a/f) each set up with the characteristic value of the standard oxygen
     sensor it uses.

   5. The hard part is that max power is reached around 13:1 ratio, max
     economy around 14.8:1 and absolute lean trouble over 15:1. 14.7:1 is
     picked as optimum for pollution reasons; CO and HC get to their lowest
     at Lambda (and go higher when richer), but NOX shoots thru the roof
     when leaner than 15:1. Before, you could lean your mixture to pass
     Smog tests, if your county tests NOX this won't work anymore. This makes
     the standard Oxygen sensor a great tool for tuning for Smog but not
     quite ideal for tuning for power. I suppose good engine management
     can ignore the Oxygen sensor at high rpms and high load (outside the
     range where the EPA tests and where fuel economy doesn't matter, but I'm
     not sure if any OEM systems do this.
       Note also, getting a lot richer is no problem (for power) but leaning
     just a wee bit can cause fits.

    6. There are 2 great books on engine management, both written by Charles
      Probst and printed by Bentley Publishing; the Bosch Fuel injection book
      is very good an applicable to Porsches, the better book for academics
      is "How to Understand, Service, and Modify Ford Fuel injection and
      Electronic engine Control," available thru Ford SVO Motorsports dealers,
      JC Whitney ($24 for 450 pages) and the publisher at 800-423-4595.

       Anyway, your idea of hooking up the Oxygen sensor with a VOM is a good
      one....BTW, which car would your cheap sender come from ?

    Hey... which would you rather have?  Personally, I would love to see
Porsche produce the Boxter.. even if they have to drop EVERY other car
they make!  Personally, I think it's the logical successor to the 356
and perhaps even the 914 s a small, true sports car.  IMHO.  I only hope
they don't price it ridiculously high (like they have been known to do!)

Unless I misunderstood, the "acceleration" involved occurs in a significantly
shorter stretch of time than 100fs. It's the duration of pulse generation
that lasts 100fs - the pulse will continue to propagate until it hits
something. Can a photon exist if it isn't propagating at 186,000mps? I mean,
it's not a photon unless it's moving at the speed of light, is it?

Porsche Design always numbered it's designs, and the 356 was
it's 356th design effort (remember, they did Kubelwagens, sun

Pugeot or some other low-life company had already trademarked the 
number so they changed it to 911.

The big question is what happens after 999? Of course, for me it
really doesn't matter because the 911 is just fine!

I guess I qualify as an auto-x crazy, since I'm driving 3500 miles round 
trip for about 8 minutes of Pro Solo thrills in Jacksonville FL later 
this month.  Here's my $.02 on rim sizes and tires.

In general, I run about the biggest thing I can squeeze on the rim that 
doesn't increase overall diameter.  Extensive testing by other BFG Team 
drivers has shown that the wider the tire the better the transient 
response (such as in slaloms), just the sort of thing you need in 
autocrossing.  However, for high speed, large sweepers and little or no 
transition-speed considerations, in many cases a smaller tire will get 
better lap times.  Why?  Because in the middle of the turn either tire is 
using only the last 1" - 2" of tread anyway, but the narrower tire 
decreases friction and allows quicker acceleration off the corner.  
(Please remember, this is for stock-type cars with significant body 
roll--real race cars use their entire tread, even in the turns.)  The 
test which this came from ran 185/60's vs 205/55's both on a 5.5" rim, on 
a Miata.  Most would say the 205/55 is just too wide for the rim, but it's 
consistently faster on the autocross course, while the 185/60 is 
consistently faster on the road race course.

Applying the above to a 951 with 7's and 8's, I went with BFG's 245-45-16 
all the way around with good results, although I wondered if the 225's on 
the front wouldn't wear better.  However, after having the tires shaved I 
got much better tire wear on the front and unbelievable grip.  Now that 
I've switched to the M030 package on the S2 (7.5" & 9" rims) I'm even 
happier with the 245's on the front, and considering carrying a set of 
245's for the rear AND a set of 255-50-16's as well.  The larger size 
effectively gives a different set of gears which allow 63mph out of 
second gear instead of the 245's 58mph top speed.  In effect I could 
change my gears for those rare courses which would otherwise require a 
quick shift up to third and back down.  I've not experienced any rubbing 
of any kind on either end, even in spins.  Remember, however, that your 
alignment settings may also have an effect on rubbing--different camber

William,

The clicking could certainly be your injectors.  Or other stuff.  Perhaps
you will find it easiest to pinpoint the source by using a stethoscope,
or just a length of PVC tubing held to your ear.  Doing so really helps
localize the source of a noise.

BTW, this trick works well for finding vacuum leaks, esp. if you pressurize
the induction system.

Happy hunting,

Subject: Rollbar/cages for 356 and C2 Cabrio

Posting this for a friend without internet access:

What is the net wisdom with respect to manufacturers of roll bars and cages
for the following applications:

1.) A cage for a '64 356C Coupe, intended use vintage racing. Prefer a cage
acceptable to all the sanctioning bodies.

2.) A bolt-in roll bar for a '93 C2 Cabriolet. As the car has a full leather
interior, etc. and is really pretty (Amazon Green) would prefer a solution
that could be de-installed without leaving interior damage. For autocrossing
and occasional track use.

Any experience re: the above is much appreciated!

Mike,
I used the automotion stuff ("gorilla snot") on my rear bushings. It seems
pretty waterproof. The spring plates do in fact make some noise though. 
Larger bumps and it's more apparent that the lube is well, Not lubing.
It does make a good seal to keep out the H2O.

Whenever I visit Paris, I do a great deal of walking (who doesn't?) and I
have a tendency to look at and into the cars parked pell-mell on curbs, on
top of each other etc.,  and I agree that they look like people live in them,
what with all the litter in the cars!  On the other hand, I get the distinct
impression that you Parisians do not have the endemic problem we have with
car thefts, car trashing, and so on.

Subject: Patrick Motorsports review


Hello 'philes,

My 914/6 3.0 SC project is slowly moving forward....and the parts
(and bills!) are coming in.  For shifting this monster, I've chosen
to use the Patrick Motorsports cable shifter for the 915 trans.
I received the parts today and examined where my money went.

The welds look great and there are many nicely machined custom
linkage parts on the shifter.  I can see why the retail on this puppy
is $625 - there's a lot of specialized labor involved.  The shift throw
is incredibly short....five inches front to back and possibly shorter
when it's installed in the car.  It has a "spring-loaded-push-down-
reverse-lockout" mechanism as well.

I also ordered some fireproof sheathing, 914 shift box mount, and
a flywheel/pressure plate hardware kit.  I never received the pressure
plate bolts.

I called them up and notified them of this, and the guy on the phone
apologized a lot and will be sending them out today via express post
in a small envelope so they don't get stuck in customs (I live in Canada).
The only questions he asked about the missing bolts was if there was
a hole in the box and to identify what bolts I had to make sure he sent
out the ones I needed.  No interrogating, no feeling awkward.

So, the quality looks good, and the service is great if there is a
problem.

Barring anything really bad happening during installation or actual
use of their parts, I'd buy stuff from them again without hesitation.
(They have a lot of neat racing parts....hi-po clutches, oil systems,
brakes, suspension, CV cages, axles, etc)

Subject: Oil Change Intervals

I'd love to hear the consensus on this:  

I have a 1995 968. The car was factory delivered with Mobil-1 synthetic oil 
(and replaced with that at the recommended 2500 mile service).  The service 
advisor, and other mechanics I've talked to, swear that I really don't need 
to change the oil more than every 7500 miles.  I'm sure this debate has 
raged here before.  Should I change it more frequently ?  Most of my driving 
is stop and go, city commuting (probably about 8-10,000 miles a year).  Thanks.

Whereas Fred is being neutral to upbeat, it seems that another angle
might be instructive:

85?  After how many days?  This is pathetic.  How many people on this list
can't afford 15 dollars?  (possible exemption for college students because I'm
in a good mood).  I'll grant you there are many other good reasons people

    How do you get a catalog of their stuff, anyway?  I called a while
back asking for info. on 914/6 conversions... still nothing yet!  I'm
wondering if this is because they probably got the impression I'm not
going to be buying a lot of stuff soon (I'm not...) because the guy on
the phone really interrogated me about exactly what I was interested in.
 I guess they don't give out catalogs to everybody!  I could really use
a good "drool book," though.

Not quite.  If I remember my history, Professor Porsche's first project

his customer as Porsche project number one, and thought that seven
would sound like he had a little more experience under his belt.

I have 7x16's on my 71 911.  Tires are 205/55's.  There is no clearance
problem front or rear, though hitting a bump at speed can make the
rears bottom momentarily.  The clearance on the front is very close,
but it does not rub even in extreme cornering.

I don't know what you mean by minor handling improvement.  You will have more
grip and slightly slower turn in and acceleration.  All I notice is that with
more rubber there is more grip and seemingly better braking.  The car is *way*
better than me anyway, so any real gains are are more perceived than actual.

YMMV

Subject: Handling (was sway bars)

Last week I made a statement that a stiffer rear suspension would cause
a car to understeer rather than oversteer.  That was clearly wrong, but
what I can't figure out is why it causes the reaction that it does.  I have
read somewhere that "two eaually loaded tires can sustain more lateral load
than one tire with twice the load".  So it would seem that the stiffer the
rear sway bar, the better the traction at the rear, and the less the oversteer.
What am I missing?  Is the statement about the tire traction untrue?

b. sweepstakes entry i sent in will fetch me at least something....wait a sec..

Subject: Wanted - Odd Items

Am looking for a used factory style muffler to fit '73 911.  If you have one
that is reasonable, and has life left in it (no pinholes), send me a note.
 Please, no sport mufflers (BTDT). 
Am also looking for some nice early 911 door pockets, but only if they really
close tightly. 
Still open to some 15" Fuchs - 6 or 7 inch, or 2 of each.  They don't have to
be perfect, just straight and reasonable.
Would also like to find some 914 fgolight lenes, but these must be absolutely
perfect, and US variety.

Watch out on lowered Porsches with the wider wheels and tires you can 
blister the paint on the top of the rear fenders. This will happen on

| Last week I made a statement that a stiffer rear suspension would cause

oversteer.
| What am I missing?  Is the statement about the tire traction untrue?

No, it is absolutely correct. The problem boils down to one of weight
transfer.  The stiffer sway bar causes more weight transfer from one
side to the other on the end to which it is installed. That is, as the
car rolls toward the outside of the turn (compressing the suspension
on the outside), a stiffer sway bar will exert an upward force on the inside
tire (tending to compress the suspension on that side also). The inside
tire will have less weight on it, the outside tire more. The inside tire will
not have enought weight on it for maximum traction and the outside tire
will not gain enough traction to make up for that lost by the inside
tire. Net is less traction. However, body roll will be reduced, so
the tires on the other end will have better weight distribution
between them, so they will have relatively better traction.

BTW, stiffer sway bar does not also mean stiffer suspension. The
spring and shock rates also figure into the equation. The discusions
of using sway bar settings to alter over/under steer assume that all
other settings are kept the same.

The above info paraphrased from "How to Make Your Car Handle"
by Fred Puhn.

BTW, my car handles great, I just need to learn how to drive it! For
me, it is off to the autocross and off to drivers ed.

Ok I'm not sure what to do with the uuencode data (is it a pix ?)...
the 930 unit needs to have a relay checked. To be more specific it sounds 
like the ignition cutout relay needs a little cleaning. This relay makes 
sure the wiper goes off when the ignition is off. By turning the ignition 
off then on (with rear wiper in a logical condition of ON (You work for 
Microsoft don't ya :-)) you are closing the contact before current is going 
to flow through a HIGH resistance contact.

Do you have the electrical diagram for the car ? If so trace the current 
flow from the rear wiper motor through to all relays involved (probably two).

If this works out put in a good word for me in the 'admissions dept.' at
uSoft, in case they need a few more good men.

Hey Nate,
As a fellow 914 guy I thought you might do me a favor by forwarding a
couple things for me because I again cannot send to tta.com.

First to the List:
The god damn car is doing it again! The 914 starts runs exactly 2 minutes
perfectly at a fast idle around 1200 rpms. It creeps up to 1500 then dies.
After that you have to crank the engine over at 5 min intervals for about
half an hour. When it finally starts it will run at only 4000 rpms plus for
about five min. What the hell is going on. I have been to several shops and
they tell me nothings wrong. I ask them about cylinder head temp sender
they sat fine and throttle switch they say its fine. I know I can't hear
the injectors fire when the car is off but ignition on with throttle opened
up.
This prblem is completely temp dependent. Summer no problem winter
frustration city. I think the problem with getting shops to diagnos it is

I forgot to tell you it is a 73 2.0l and the fi had a new brain put in it
because the mechanic said that would fix it not. actually he put three
brains in it he calims they keep getting fried.

From R&T:

     - the 4-cyl engine option has been dropped (reason below)
     - the price in Germany is to be ~DM70,000 ($45k American)
     - the base engine will be water-cooled, 2.5 l, H6, 200 bhp
     - up-scale plant 3.0 l, 250 bhp

I had a plethora of problems like these disappear when I replaced the
relay panel inside the engine compartment.

They're not cheap (GPR has rebuilts), so you might try cleaning it up
real well and see if anything improves.

And note that there are two temperature sensors on the motor.  The other
one is on the block.

Finally, have you made sure that the accelerator VALVE isn't sticking?

Yea, I saw that in the manual as well. I'm sure it must have some type of
resistance that varies with gate position. Being that I'm an electronics
head, I will check out the impedance situation when looking at the unit.
However, I went out to my car and found that the rubber boot to the air
meter was just a bit lose. Probably just lose enough so that it would let
in a little air in cold weather (since the rubber would of course be hard
....) when the engine vibrated a certain way. In any case, I tighted the
hose clamp and hopefully that will solve the problem - naaw, too easy ....
:-)

In any case, thank you very much for your time and info. You seem to be

I installed a "blade style" late model rear spoiler and an "S" front spoiler
on my '80 928, and it looks great.  It was fairly easy to do.  You have to
drill holes in the rear hatch frame for four bolts (two on each side) to
mount the rear spoiler.  The front spoiler is a little more difficult, only
because locating the correct spots to drill holes requires some care and
fitting.  I did not cut brake venting holes in the front lower body panel.
Because of this, the front spoiler had to be cut with a Dremel grinder to
fit flush.  In my opinion, it looks better than it would with the brake
vent holes (it looks very streamlined).  If you take your time, it might
take 2 hours to mount the rear spoiler and 4 hours for the front (if you
are a perfectionist, like me).  I recommend aftermarket parts, only because
the cost of Porsche parts seems unnecessarily high (aftermarket is just as
good in many cases).  Try calling 928 International in Anaheim, CA for
pricing and spoiler options (714-632-9288).

Sorry I missed the first post.  I've had really good luck with stuck stuff 
by simply (so he says) reducing the size of the part or expanding what it's 
stuck in.

If I'm not mistaken (too lazy to look it up) mild steel, for example, 
changes about a thousandth for every degree F in temp.

Dwight Mitchell recommended I heat the shit out of a head with a stuck 
exhaust stud, and it worked.  Damn oil fires.  Gotta watch that torch.

I've had excellent results with cooling parts with Freon (before we knew it 
was nasty on the O.L.) and more recently with liquid nitrogen that I pinch 
from the lab down the hall.

Don't ask me how I'd cool a drain plug on the bottom of the trans with 
nitrogen.  I guess you'd have to invert the car.  Actually, if you'd turned 
the car on it's side, you could have drained it out the fill plug. :)

	modified head, 211 hp

Flow (power) without carps and intake manifold, lift 11 mm:

	standard head, 209 hp
	modified head, 246 hp

After the recent posts I've seen on this list, I'm beginning to think GOOD
dealers are the exception. Today I call up the local dealer (MCL in
Vancouver BC) to enquire about manuals and availability of the 944 belt
tension tool. As usual, nothing is available from these Canadian
dealerships. As we discuss the belt tool, the dealer parts/service guy
admits to me that they don't even use or have the P9201 tool in the shop! 
He claimed that they use some other type of tool but didn't elaborate.
I suspect they do it by feel only. I guess if you do enough of these 
jobs, you get to know how tight from experience. Then again, maybe these 
guys are just negligent.
 
I wonder how many other dealers are like this?

Can anyone out who REALLY knows how a Quaife differential works explain it to

transfers torque more smoothly than a regular limited slip, and it does
change the handling of my car for the better, I think, but it has some
unusual traits. It does not work when one wheel starts on a very slippery
surface, and one wheel can easily spin opposite the other when the car is up
in the air, just like an open rear. I took it out, and I can't say that now I
notice much of a change back to the open rear. If it is broken, I can't tell!

My owner's manual (the distillation of the factory's sacred wisdom) says to
change at 7500 miles, and the factory is often suspected of being a bit 
conservative where the reputation of the good Porsche name is concerned.

On the other hand, necessary or not, there is a widely held idea that there is 
something magical about changing oil *and* filter every 3000 miles.  The owner
who follows this dictum and *keeps* his records meticulousy, is probably going
to get *top* dollar when he sells this toy...

One other, not inconsequential consideration, is that keeping your toy filled 
with *clean* oil is probably the single most important thing you can do for it
to give it's engine a long, happy life.

    argh!  I know Bart didn't write this, but my mailer won't realize
that fact...
    Anyhoo... if most of your driving is stop and go commuting, you
probably should think about maybe changing the oil more often,
especially since you drive such low mileage per year (I'm assuming you
would drive it every day, meaning it only gets driven a short distance
every time it's driven.)
    This kind of driving is very hard on a car... much of the engine
wear occurs at startup, and also if the engine never warms up, the oil
detergents don't work as effectively (solubility of engine crud is
dependent on temp.) and nasty foo can build up in your engine.
    But hell, I was considering switching to Syntec in my '71 914 with
104,000 miles on it, so I may just be overcautious.  Then again, it's a
p-car, so wouldn't it make sense to take extra special care of it?

Subject: re: RE: Boxter retooling to end 968/928 production

Hey Jeff,

I didn't realize things were that bad for Porsche's watercooled sales.  
Since I own a 951S I just assumed there was always a market for at least 
the 968.  I still think that I'll buy a 968 cabrio some day.  I can see 
how the 928 could have problems with value/price positioning relative to 
the new 993. It's always been an expensive Luxo barge and I guess it's now 
caught on a sand bank.  I wonder why they never lowered the price.  Surely 
it doesn't cost Porsche so much to make a 928 that they ask for 80K+ a 
copy after delivery, dealer margin, etc., does it?

What I would like to see Porsche do is decrease the price of the 968 into 
the sub 30K range and make them competitive with the homogenized sports 
coupe market.  They could then sell the Boxter in the 35-45K range and 
sell the 993 at 50K+.   I would imagine that if given a choice, a person 
would want to buy a 968 instead of a Mustang, Surpra or RX-7.  I'm sure 
there would still be enough markup in the channel for everyone to make 
money.  

On a different note.  You're at a Porsche dealership.  Would you please 
tell me (if you can) how many 944 Turbo S coupes Porsche made in 1988 and 
1989 and how many were shipped to the US.  I'm trying to determine how 
rare my copy is.  Also, if you know how many Black/Tan leather ones were 
made I appreciate knowing.  

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Oil Change Intervals

On cars that run rich (like 951s with chips or carb'd 911) I feel it's
more important to change oil frequently than to use $$ oil.

In my 951 I used Mobil 1 and changed at 4K, or more frequently durring
track season since the performance chips tend to run very ricjh and
dirty the oil.

On my 911 I change every 3-4K and use Castrol or Pennzoil 20W50, since
14x$4.00 is expensive, and the carbs quickly dirty it.

On the hoindas I change every 6K and use  Castrol Syntec, 5-50.  I`ve
got 167K and 133K on them ad they are non oil burning and see 7K rpms
occasionally.  The Ciic Si has even been at the track half a dozen
times.

Anyway, I would worry more about clean oil.  If you change every 3K and
do not have an engine that ruins hot (like a turbo`s turbo) I think
regular oil is OK.  On a car like a hoinda that takes 4 qts, I don't
mind the extra $12 in oil for the peace of mind.

Yes. The original question remains, and I've often wondered about it
myself. I believe Porsche recommends 15K miles between oil changes in my
944 maintenance manual. Since they made the engine, they should know
something about it. Changing the oil at 3K increments just wastes money
if it is doing no good whatsoever.

I change my oil usually at around 5K miles. But as the original poster said -
where did this 3K miles come from? Just saying "cheap insurance" doesn't
answer the question.

Embry riddle (airplane school) did a test some years ago on the flat
aircooled fours in their fleet of cassna 150's (flight school =
beat on engine).  in several they didn't EVER change the oil over the
life of the engine ~= 2000 hours.  They just topped up and changed the
filter on the normal schedule.  When they tore them down they didn't
find any appreciable wear differences between the oil changed engines
and the non-changed engines.  The only problem they had was keeping the
pH of the oil correct.  'course the engines are operated a little
differently in a plane - but food for thought !

Hi all,
I don't want to restart the debate about whether a K&N filter is good
or bad for engine life, but I am curious about a totally different 
aspect. Fellow Porschephiles helped me understand that a brake booster
derives the boost from engine vacuum. Now the K&N is supposed to flow
more air, hence there should be less pressure differential from the air
intake tract to outside air, and that should cause less vacuum. Would this
be noticable ? Or have I misunderstood something?

Sigh...  Some people....

There are three issues  that make oil changes important:

1) viscosity breakdown. Due to the thermal qualities of operating inside
   a contained blast furnace (i.e. your engine), the petroleum base of 
   the oil "cooks" and seeks to re-comform itself into a different
   polymer, one that's not as good at lubrication. This is an
   "hours of operation" issue, since it's time at temp related.
   This motivates oil coolers, and was the origin of the low mile
   oil change recommendation -- early multigrade oils just didn't
   stay together very well.

   Synthetics don't have this problem. Hence the 15000 mile recomendation.

2) particulate contamination. IN layman's terms, "crap in the oil". As
   combustion occurs, you may carbonize small bits of oil on the hot
   parts of the engine. You may have some ring blow-by that inserts
   other particulate into the engine. You may have dust, grit, etc that
   gets in via the breather. You will have small bits of metal as your
   engine wears.

   This is the genesis of the oil filter. No matter if your oil will go
   a million miles, if you don't change the oil filter you will have
   bearing surfaces abraded by the particulate in suspension. Coarse
   particulate will be trapped by the filter or the magnet in the sump.
   The finer particulate will remain suspended in the oil, causing even more 
   abrasion (and more additional fine particulate!). 

   To remove this fine particulate, you have to change the oil. Hence the 
   lower milage oil change requirements.

3) fluid contamination. Your engine requires air, gas, and optionally
   water/coolant. Any of these may mix with the oil if there is any
   leakage. Air causes foaming which reduces all lubricant efficiency and
   elminated cooling capacity. Water makes salad dressing, and is not pretty
   to see what an engine run on Miracle Whip looks like at disassembly.
   Gas may get introduced via "wash down" if you're running too rich or
   if you have rings that haven't seated well. It's a solvent, which reduces
   your oils' ability to do anything.

   The only way to know if you have any of this is to drain the oil. The
   only way to keep it from eating your engine alive is to replace the
   oil.

So, as noted: frequent oil changes.

Probably never happens. Just as car makers (Porsche included) don't tell,
and probably don't even record, minor repaints after test drives, assembly
line scratches, etc. It happens, and it happens a lot. I think I saw a

356 carbs and radio
 
Weber carburetors were used on the Carrera GS/GT cars, which used a
completely different engine from your Super 90; that's the famous four-cam
engine. Depending on year, they used Soles 40 PII (like the S 90 and SC) or
Weber 40 DCM. Chances are you have aftermarket Weber 40 IDF carbs. These
usually have a smaller venturi than the stock Solexes, meaning you get less
air flow and less power. Weber - usually 28 mm venturi; Solex - 32 mm
venturi.
 
Radio blanking plates are available to close off the holes already stamped
for the Blaupunkt radio if no radio is installed; these should be one
rectangular hole flanked by two round holes for the control shafts. With the
radio installed, all of the holes are neatly closed (by bezels included with
the radio and knobs). No other plate is needed. If you are using a more
modern radio, I don't know how it fits. You won't be able to hear it anyway,
might as well get a vintage genuine surround sound monaural Blaupunkt. <g>

Subject: 911 Wheel Bearings Revisited


I followed most of the thread on 914 front wheel bearings a while ago, but 
did not really get all the facts. Here is my question:

When the front bearings are **exactly** right, should there be **any** 
top-to-bottom slop? ie. I find on my SC that I have to tighten the bearning
nut really tight (certainly much more than specified in the Hayes manual, 
where you should be able to rotate the thrust washer) to reduce the slop.
I have not tighted them so tight to have the wheels exibit no slop. Of
course, the slop is noticed when the car is jacked up with the front
wheels in the air.

So, how tight should the bearing nut be? Are my wheel bearing shot? I need
to get an alignment, and want the wheel bearings to be setup right before
dropping the $$$.

Thanks in advance

Subject: Re: Oil Change Intervals

Jeff asks:


"I change my oil usually at around 5K miles. But as the original poster
said - where did this 3K miles come from? Just saying "cheap insurance"
doesn't answer the question."


Well, the only way to answer the question is to analyze (as in
performing actual analytical chemistry) the oil every 1K miles to see
how much dirt, moisture, unburnt gasoline and decomposition products
are present. All four are bad. Some people just look at the color of
the oil and change it (and the filter) when it looks too dark.

So unless you want to have the analysis done (which would be expensive
and inconvenient) the answer "cheap insurance" is the right answer.
Assuming you do not race the car, drive very short distances only
(which is a real killer for any engine) or drive in extremely dusty
conditions and, your car is not running outrageously rich... a change
every 3K miles HAS to be safe. This conservative guideline is the best
protection you can provide for your engine.

A convenient, semi-intuitive way to set your own standards would be to
evaluate the color of your oil every 1K miles. You can assume as the
darker the oil becomes the more it has broken down. I doubt if the
color will reflect the presence of gasoline or water. You would need to
have someway to reproducibly evaluate the oil color (say put it in a
small test tube and hold it up in front of the exact same light
source... you could seal the tube and compare each sample as you get to
5K miles). If you don't trust the paradigm of 3K miles, you can make
your own decision.

Synthetic oil is another question. I do not have any idea how readily
this oil absorbs water, how sensitive the viscosity is to gasoline or
how the color changes as it breaks down and gets dirty.

Bill,

I agree with the received wisdom of 3,000 mile intervals.  Seems to work;
cheap insurance.

One thing to keep in mind when referring to factory recommended intervals
is the following.  Cars are getting rated nowadays by projected service
and repair costs, as for example in AutoWeek and Consumers' Report.  If
you double or quadruple the oil change interval, you halve a cost, and in
fact what some people view as an inconvenience.

With the 993, the book rate for an oil change is -- urgh -- 3 hours.  And, 
as of
the Carrera 4, you have to drop the exhaust to adjust the valves.  That kind
of labour really motivates PCNA to push the service intervals out.

Scott,

Given your description, I recommend you get the car on a gas analyzer and
set its basic mix, ie lambda disconnected.  The surging you describe may
be something which the lambda sensor simply cannot correct.  You may have
false air (vacuum leak).  Pressurize the intake and look for leaks.  Or it 
could
be something else, like a bad idle stabilizer (very rare), or one that's

(more common).  But that's the order I'd check things.

Yes the manual says 7.5K or 15K.  But, it also says that vehicles
operated under less than ideal conditions should get oil/filter
changes more frequently.  What are "less than ideal" conditions?

    extremes of temperature
    dirty/dusty environments

Howdy,

On my '72 S, most of the combinations of 7x15 and 7x16 that were
recommended by several people won't fit on the rear. i.e.

 - 7x16 in the rear with a 205/55 
 - 7x15 all around with 205/60s 
 - 7x15 all around with 205/50s front - 225/50s rear 

I can not even fit 195/60/15 on the rear with stock 7" rims.
But my car is as low as it will go and still handle well. And the 911
cars are not all the same, so try to borrow the size you are interested
in and drive it HARD to see what happens.

I had only slight rubbing problems with 225/50/15 on stock 7x15 on the front.
But on the rear I had to use the early 911R offset wheels (Revolutions).
The stock 7" rims have all the extra 1" width on the outside of the rim.
The 911R has all (or most?) on the inside. 
Still, the 911R wheels rubbed on the inside spring plate, so I had to use
thin spacers under the wheel, which spread the extra 1" evenly inside and
out.
This combination looks funny because the front looks wider than the rear,
and may not be great for high speed track driving (may oversteer).

The 7x15 with 225/50/15's sure make an early 911 look muscular!
Too bad I have to go back to 6x15 and 205/50/15 for SCCA stock class... 
I guess I can still run the big ones in PCA!

If it is the same as my 84 944 the circle with dashes round it is indeed the
low pad indicator. If your pads are good and the light is still on it
probably means that the sensors were not replaced when the pads were. The way
the sensors work is that once they are ground away by friction with the disc,
the embedded wire is cut, and the light goes on on your dash. 

You have to replace the sensor or the light will not go out. It only takes
one sensor to activate the light, so check them all you may only need to
replace one.

As Martin points out, aircraft engines do operate differently; they use
different (ashless) oils, they operate in a, generally, far cleaner
environment than cars - even when on the ground, and they are operated at
constant RPM for the majority of the operating time and subsequently do not
undergo the continual load changes imposed on auto engines, therefore

That's very interesting.  Actually that brings up another question.  After 
reading the Probst Fuel Injection book over the weekend, it seems that the 
pressure difference will stay the same, because this is a function of the 
throttle valve.  However because the air filter has less restriction, the 
same pressure difference would seem to result in better throttle response. 
 I guess what I'm thinking is that the air would flow slightly more quickly? 
into the cylinder.  Anyway, how would this affect the fuel metering?  Take 
my CIS(K-Jetronic) Rabbit-----please.  Wouldn't the lesser restriction cause 
a change in the sensor plate movement and thus throw off my metering.  Or is 
the change so little as to not affect anything?

   Hi all,
   I don't want to restart the debate about whether a K&N filter is good
   or bad for engine life, but I am curious about a totally different
   aspect. Fellow Porschephiles helped me understand that a brake booster
   derives the boost from engine vacuum. Now the K&N is supposed to flow
   more air, hence there should be less pressure differential from the air
   intake tract to outside air, and that should cause less vacuum. Would 
this
   be noticable ? Or have I misunderstood something?

one thing that we can benefit from the aiviation world, however, is oil
analysis labs.  maybe these advertise in the racing papers too, I don't know.

but plenty of places advertise in the airplane mags.  think the prices
are about $50 a shot.  course only doing it once doesn't really tell
you a whole lot - what you really need is several spaced over racing
season or somthing like that.  they usually will tell you things like
silicate ppm (dirt), carbon, ferrous and non-ferrous metals which are
sometimes in size groups too.  my usuall rule of thumb is if it's
in the oil, ferrous and has a part number on it then somethings
probably wrong :-)

Bill,
Thanks for your long e-mail regarding my questions!

  >>Changing the thermostat heat value is like wrapping a leaking 
  >> hose with tape

My hoses are new and the pressure cap is new.  I've replaced the thermostat 
and have noticed that the temp seems to run a bit warmer when moving
and a bit cooler when stopped (i.e., the old thermostat probably opened
up too much when moving and didn't open up enough when stopped in
traffic).  I have to wait for summer before I see if it works out OK in
traffic
with the a/c running; however, your point about not screwing around with
a different thermostat due to effects on the rest of the system is well
taken.

  >>1. Make sure your radiator fins are clear of leaves and other garbage
  >> so the air flow through freely

I will try to clean out the fins on the radiator with a hose within 
the next week or two.  I seem to have some dirt in the a/c "radiator"
but can't see the main radiator well enough to know.

  >>Use Phosphate free coolant (Phosphates eat aluminum) and 
  >>distilled water can't hurt.  Be sure to bleed the air out of the 
  >>system per the shop manual.  Air bubbles can cause overheating.  
 
I changed the coolant (phosphate free and distilled water) when I
bought the car in Feb 94 -- it was clear and "new" looking at the time 
(it probably was new in order to disguise any problems).  After 10 
months or so it was gray. I'm hoping that if I do have a leak it's not 
in the head gasket.  It probably isn't, as the engine runs really well 
(no obvious problems that would happen if you had a compression 
leak somewhere).  

  >>Coolant is much more likely to leak to an oil passage than the 
  >>other way around.  This is due to the coolant system being under 
  >>pressure and coolant flows easier than oil


You're right about which way things should leak due to 
pressurization, but here's another fact I didn't communicate 
earlier.  I replaced the coolant expansion tank two weeks ago
because it had a small hole which did 2 things:  it leaked and it 
probably kept the cooling system from attaining proper 
pressurization.

The water pump costs $1,200???  (Ye Gods!)   Is this a
gold plated pump or can it be had elsewhere for less (like my $240
Valeo alternator that would have cost $899 from Porsche)??
What is "water pump coolant"  and I didn't do anything special to
bleed the system ... what should I have done?

  >>Could be the previous owner loaded it up with stop leak and 
  >> plugged some of the radiator tubes

Don't know for sure, but it doesn't piddle on the ground so I assume
that I don't have any external leaks.

Regarding the electric fan ... it comes on when the engine temp 
gage gets in the hot range and immediately brings the 
temperature down.  The gage never hits the peg.

Question for you... my manual says that the electric fan should 
run even with the ignition off, but it doesn't.  Stop the engine 
and the electric fan stops too.  Does your electric fan run when
the engine is off?

Question for everyone ... I've just bought some cable snow
"Chains" to go up to Mammoth for a ski trip.  Anyone have any
experience with 928's and snow chains/cables?

  >>BTW:  Do you have a US Spec 928 or a Euro Spec model?

I think I have a US Spec model as it has the cat converter needed to
be smog legal in California.  It was purchased from a California dealer
and has all the appropriate stickers that one would expect.

I've got $100 on the way to Stan via snail mail and have also agreed to contribute
to the general collection fund.

I feel that there shouldn't have to be a minimum total amount pledged before we go
ahead with this collection.  No matter how much is pledged, let's continue with the
collection for Stan.  Any amount of money has to be better than none at all.

Porschephiles members, please contribute whatever you can and let's show Stan
that we appreciate all his efforts to maintain this list.

Subject: 911 Sport Seats...

How long have the "sport seats" been available for 911's?  Of the cars 
I've looked at, a couple of late '80s cars had them.  I really like the 
extra side bolstering, but I'm not sure how common this option was.  Did 
the sport seats come as part of a "Sport Package"?  What else would have 
been in that package?  Can these seats be purchased (through dealers or 
the aftermarket) and installed in, say a '78 and newer 911s?  Did 
Porsche make non-electric seats (less weight) that had the bigger 
bolsters and still came in leather trim?  RS America seats maybe?

I'm trying not to limit myself my selection of used 911s too much by 
insisting of things like sport seats, specific int./ext. colors, etc.  
But I'd really like to get those sport seats somehow...

Subject: factory warning and gossip

No not gossip from the factory but gossip about the factory.
Production of the 968 Cabrio has stopped, there are loads
unsold. That's a shame as we were due to get a 968 Club
Sport Cabrio but this has been cancelled (obviously). 
928 production has practically been an an order basis
for some time.

No more factory trips after June 1995 as the factory is
being overhauled for 986 Boxster and 996 production. The
996 is supposed to be a 911 replacement..... again. They
couldn't stop production of the 911 SC when it was getting
mixed reviews and steady sales so how come they expect the
new 911 Carrera which is getting rave reviews and selling
like hotcakes, well in Britain anyhow, to die? The factory
trips may not re-open until 1997. So anyone interested, as
recent mailings suggest, get your skates on.

The poor sales of the 968 may well be due to love it or
hate styling changes, many 944 owners say they will stay
with the 944 and skip the 968 ready for the Boxster. Shame
as everything else about the 968 seemed right to me.

Subject: Attempted car theft experience

The discussion of car theft prevention took me back to my school sojourn
in an area of Philadelphia, PA known as "West Philadelphia". 

One morning I came out of the apartment to find my (t)rusty 70T with the 
small triangular passenger's side door window smashed.

The ignition lock cylinder was on the floor.  

It looked like the thief slap hammered it out of the lock, but were scared 
away before they could finish the job.

I went to the dealer and got a new window and epoxied the ignition
lock, minus a few pins messed up by the slap hammer, back together.

Afterwards, I would remove the steering wheel when I parked the car.  

Only one nut holds the 70T steering wheel on, and by punching index
marks on the splined shaft and wheel, it can be re-indexed quickly.

I hadn't fixed my horn, so re-installing the center steering wheel section
was horn noise free.

This was pre-CLUB days.

I assumed the thieves wouldn't be willing to bring their own steering wheel
and would be clever enough to realize they couldn't drive away without one.

I never had another problem.

But I do remember one comment from a passerby seeing me carrying the
steering wheel up to the apartment:

   "Is that all they left?"

Subject: RE: Stan's 914

Pfilers,

Based on the responses I have received today it seems that more
background is needed on the saga of Stan, his 914, his situation,
this group of folks, and the status of the "Rescue Effort".

For a variety of reasons a lot of people are not up to speed on this thread and
are wondering exactly what is going on and why are we appealing to the list
for the 15 clams.  It seems to me that the relatively low number of responses
to
Fred is more indicative of the true number of daily followers than the number
of people willing to help out on this effort :^)

Here is the compressed version of how this thread started and it's
current status:

Definately *not* to scale:

	(Actually I missed the original message and was very confused
	 when the first person suggested we take up a collection so I
	 wrote Stan and said "Huh?"

*	Stan sends message regarding butthead (my word, not his)
	customer who goes Chapter 11 after being 60 days late.
	As a result, Stan decides to put his 914 racer on the block
	for $7000.00

* 	A bunch of people identify this to be a deplorable
	state and suggest taking up a collection so Stan can cover
	short term costs and *not* have to sell his 914.  Some people
	request Stan's snail mail address so they can send money.

	(editorial aside:  RTF Monthly newsletter.  It's there)

	(editorial aside: #2  Ditto re: the thread on Porsche Numbering
	 scheme.  Asking this question proves not having RTF newsletter
	 and displays general lacking of any clue regarding amount of work
	 Stan puts into this thing for our general amusement and knowledge).

*	Fred Pack rises to the occasion and figures someone should
	*actually* do something about this.  Realizing how silly it would
	be for people to randomly send money to Stan, Fred offers to
	collect pledges.  He figures that if 500 or so people are in,
	we can raise the 7k with about 15$/person. (Is this a great
	country or what?)

	Fred offers to collect pledges until 2/11.  If reasonable
	critical mass exists, he will then take the next step which
	is....  I don't know what it is.  Do we all send 15$ to
	Stan and let him go to the bank with  ~500 15$ checks....?
	I don't know but that's a detail we can handle *after* we
	get critical mass.

*	Fred sends out status to the list with news that 85 or so have
	joined up.  Keep the cards and letters coming.

* 	Vol thinks this is pathetic and wonders if we need to print
	up about 500 Certificates with the following:

	**** Dr T*d's No-Op Award for Non-Contribution ****

	Where-in recipients are awarded for the ability to take up space,
	do nothing, add no value and get rewarded for it.

	Instead Vol send's yesterday's post.

*	Several people write to Vol saying:  "I missed this thread and
	would really like to know what's going on".

And here we are.

Keep in mind that Stan has had nothing to do with any of this.  This is
simply something that some folks would like to do.  For a mere 15$ we
can rise to a truly worthy cause.  Why?  Because we can, and wouldn't
it make a great story ;^)

Attached see Freds original post.

Thanks,

Vol

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Begin included message:

Fred Pack sez....

I think that the person who suggested that we porschephiles
contribute to buy Stan's 914 racecar for Stan had a very good idea.

Here's my thought:

There are about 500 people on the list (More, I think. I haven't kept the
recent listing of all the names.)

Stan wants $7000 for his car.

This works out to approx $10-$15 per person.  We have each SURELY gotten this
much value and enjoyment out of pfiles.

SO -- Here's my suggestion:

Each person willing to donate $15 (or more!) should send me an email
off-line, stating his email and willingness to contribute $15. If I get a
critical mass of these I'll let everyone know and the pledgees can actually
make their donations.


		     SEND ME THESE EMAILS BY FEB 11 !!!

If too Few sign up, the idea is a Did Not Start. If Many sign up it's a Go.
If Very Many sign up, the rate per person goes down.

I'll let everyone know the results by Feb 15.

OK???

Couldn't it also be a failing manifold pressure sensor?  It could cause a 
rich-running condition that is less of a problem when the engine is cold.  
The waiting time would be for the excess fuel to evaporate and the rising 
idle would be from the extra fuel.  Of course, it doesn't explain the 
seasonal symptoms.  It might be worth the few seconds it takes to sniff the 
oil filler cap.  If it smells like gasoline, check the pressure sensor.

Side note to Gary:  Where would the second engine temperature sensor be?  I 
would swear that my `74 2.0 only has the head temp sensor (and the air temp 
sensor in the air cleaner).  I've also never seen any reference to it in any 
of the manuals.

I've never had any luck with the procedure in the Haynes manual (which
I believe was taken out of the Porsche factory manual). If you leave
them slightly loose like Haynes says (able to move the washer under gentle
force from a screwdriver), they will loosen up more and become way too
loose ("way" is a scientific term, because I am a scientist).

So I tighten them enough so that it takes some force to move the washer,
and the bearings will stay tight for years. There may still be a slight bit
of slop by shaking the top of the wheels, this is normal. But it should
not be much.

Good Luck, Mike Piera AnalogMike@aol.com '72 911S, '73 914/2.0

> The water pump costs $1,200???  (Ye Gods!)

When I had the water pump installed I had the belt changed as well.  Since 
it was so far apart, it seemed like a good idea.  Some small parts were 
needed for the belt adjuster, but nothing major.

Most of the expense was I had it done at the dealer which uses new Porsche 
parts only.  I have not found any mechanics out my way that I trust very far 
with my Chevy commuter car, much less my 928.  So far the dealer has done 
good work and has all the right "special' tools.  From the ads in Pano and 
Excellence, repairs done at a Porsche dealer are guaranteed for two years, 
unlimited mileage.  Should the dealer screw up though, I can always cry to 
Porsche N.A.  This adds a comfort factor, though expensive.


> What is "water pump coolant"
It's an additive you can buy at most auto part stores for your cooling 
system, you just dump it in.  Prestone makes it among others.  Your coolant 
most likely already has it included in it's mix.  I change coolant every two 
years and add a can every other year between these changes.


> I didn't do anything special to bleed the system ... what should I have 
done?
I'd have to check the book to be sure.  I believe the heater control has to 
be set to hot with the car level for the '84.  It varies by year.  The 
problem is the radiator is lower than the engine, so special steps are 
needed.  This is the reason the overflow tank is located back by the 
firewall, to get up high as possible.

Chilton has a mini repair book for the 944 & 928.  I highly recommend 
getting one.  No one else (Haynes, Motor, etc.) makes a book on the 928. 
 Though it's not near as comprehensive as the workshop manuals, it is a good 
deal at $8-10.  I refer to it for it's brief comprehensive explanations and 
diagrams.  It's also easier to hold! :)  It's handy for things like bleeding 
the cooling system.
I use my shop manuals when I need more detailed info. and before treading 
into new areas of the car repair.


> I replaced the coolant expansion tank two weeks ago
Did you resolve the coolant level problem, or was it legitimately low due to 
the leaks?


> my manual says that the electric fan should run even with the ignition

Mine works the same way.  I believe earlier years worked that way, but too 
many batteries died as a result.  Never a problem.

Working perfectly.

Not personally.  But I've heard you need to get very thin ones (like the 
ones Porsche sells/use to sell?) or they will hit the lip of the fender. 
 Careful not to nick up the forged alloy rims, they go for $1,200 each new 
($200-400 used).

>I think I have a US Spec. model
The beauty of the US engine is it's lower compression ratio.  Should your 
timing belt break, the valves will NOT hit your pistons and cause a 
financial hemorrhage.  Mine went last fall and despite constant cranking 
after the fact (I didn't suspected the belt at first), no bent valves!  I'll 
trade the few extra HP for this peace of mind any day!

The valves will meet pistons (and bend) when the belt breaks on ALL water 
cooled Porsche engines EXCEPT on the 16 valve US Spec.. 928 engine.


Here's a question for you.  Does your High intensity washer pump work?  This 
is the button under your dash pod next to the wiper delay control wheel.  If 
it does, can you tell if it uses the same pump as your windshield/headlamp 
washers?  Mine does not work and I'm wondering if there is another pump for 
this, or if it is the wiring.
My normal windshield washer and headlight washer both work OK off the wiper 
control stick.

A money saving tip - check out "Tire Rack" for your tires 1-800-428-8355.
they will ship you your tires at a much lower price than the high street tire
stores, and, as they are in Indiana and you are in California -No Tax!, just
a $6.00 approx shipping charge per tire.

I shopped around the high street stores, the best deal in Phoenix  (Discount
Tire) for Yokohama A008P's was $175.99 per tire + balancing + tax = $799.56
for four.

By drop shipping the same tires to my Porsche repair shop it is $135.00 per
tire + $6.00 delivery + 0 Tax  then $60.00 mount and balance for a total of
$620.00 -   BIG DIFFERENCE!


If you have no inexpensive means to get them mounted and balanced you can
always beat Discount Tire over the head with Tire Rack's price and they will
match it but you will still pay tax and stems and balancing.

Good luck

Subject: Headlight Washer


On my 1983 944, I have little headlight washers.  These are mounted on the 
front bumper, and when I press the button in the cockpit a high pressure 
stream of windshield washer fluid blasts the headlights.

At least, that's the way it's supposed to work.

When I press the button, only the left headlight washer works.  The 
right-hand one doesn't work.  I though it might be plugged up with wax or 
something, but despite poking around as best I could with a needle in the 
nozzle, I wasn't able to fix it.

Washer fluid is getting to the front of the car though, because even though 
washer fluid doesn't come out of the nozzle, it does leak out under the 
front spoiler somewhere.  Indeed, it gushes each time I press the button. 
 Now, because the washer nozzle is mounted on the bumper, I don't see any 
easy way to get at this and fix it.  Does anyone know what's involved here? 
 Should I just cave in and take it to my mechanic?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Mine was broken so I replaced it and I can hear a relay "click" when it's
pushed, but nothing else happens.  My normal washer pump works OK
and the headlite pump works great (when the headlites are up only!), but
whatever pump is run by the button doesn't do diddly.

In fixing the rest of the washer system I did run across multiple pumps (one
under the front tank that contains your special washer/cleaning solution and
one on the right fender).  For the life of me, I simply can't remember if
there
is also a pump under the fender tank.

I know the pump *on* the fender is the one for the windshield normal 
squirts as I had to trouble-shoot it.

This is one of my lower priority projects!

After several days operation (heater on, a/c on, nothing on, etc.) and

again after my weekend trip (approx 650 miles).

  >> Chilton has a mini repair book for the 944 & 928.

Got it.  And the Porsche shop manuals.  And a bootlegged troubleshooting
guide for the temp controls.  Each has its use and (usually) the Chilton
manual
complements the Porsche manuals nicely.  At the least, you get two different
diagrams or pictures of the same thing ... sometimes that clears up questions
by itself!

If you look inside the front bumper, you will see a couple of hoses with
connections that feed both the left and the right HL washer.  Since your
left one is working, you can assume that the fluid pressure is getting to
the junction...diagnosis from this point is left as an exercise for the
student.

Oh, the bumper is removed by two 19 mm bolts (accessed from the bottom of
the bumper through two access holes).  Use a half-inch drive socket if you
have it available. Rust can occasionally be hard to work through.
Be careful not to damage the connections to the lights mounted in the bumper.

Good luck,

It depends completely on the individual who's handling the registration 
task.  This year, with things going through PCA National, it's a bit 
different so nobody knows yet.  Historically the Registrar took a 
first-come, first-serve approach, based on normal your entry postmark 
date.  When the Registrar had sufficient personal time, he/she mailed 
confirmation packets.

Same as above.  Once the 625 spots are filled, you go into a queue 
based on the postmark of your entry form.

Subject: Stan's 914

Some good points have been made regarding "The Stan's 914" fund.

This is not a charity request, we are returning a favor.

If Stan were to go away for any reason we would be hard pressed to find
another person of comensurate knowledge of both Porsches AND Computer
Networking with both the equipment at his (or her) disposal AND the
willingness to put in the time, therefore we should consider ourselves
extremely fortunate to enjoy the forum that we have and perhaps we should
realize why this group is so successful.

Thurthermore, I have to believe that any active Porsche driver in this group
has saved money through their participation, either through advice from
others that have helped them to a correct choice, or just plain trading of
items on the net. For instance,  I, for one, have saved by buying items from
George Beuselinck, whom I would never had known without participation here.
On the other side of the coin I have (just) shared some money saving advice
on tire purchases which saved me $180.00 myself and I hope will do the same

Last week I made a statement that a stiffer rear suspension would cause
a car to understeer rather than oversteer.  That was clearly
wrong.........(edited)

Bill

================================================================
Bill,  A sway bar is designed to help reduce body roll by increasing roll
resistance. This means that it will put more load on the outside tire than if
there were no swaybar. This will in effect make the load on the tires more
unequal, and reduce the traction at that end of the car. So a rear sway bar
would make the car oversteer more. This does not mean that you are ruining
the traction at that end of the car though. The loss of traction (due to
higher outside tire loading) is usually compensated for by better camber (due
to less roll). Also the traction at the OTHER end of the car is improved
because it will roll less as well. This also contributes to more oversteer. I
have found that you should tune your car to be neutral for best results. If
you can put larger rear tires on, the car will understeer more, so tighten or
install a larger rear swaybar to take advantage of the improved traction at
the back. This will transfer more traction to the front, make the car neutral
again, and improve your overall grip. Hope that wasn't too long winded!

Is there any truth?  Is the boxster going to really pump water? 

The process of rebuilding the 914 engine continues.  Case is just about 
complete and ready for the fuel system.  I wanted to know a few things 
about the initial value adjustment and distributor installation.  The
impeller has a red and white notch.  Which one is #1 TDC?  Is the other
7.5 or 27 BTDC?  

In preparation for installation of the fuel system I'd like to know a 
good source for fuel-injection hose and vaccuum hose and an estimate of
how much I'll need.  

Also, since I have the dreaded/blessed NPR 96mm kit installed I will be 
using 2.0l injectors.  I've noticed a big difference in price between the
73-74 2.0l and the 75-76 2.0l injectors are they both compatible with the
existing 1.7 FI?

Hoping to drive my lil' 914 sometime this year...

Subject: How do you choose your oil.........


Text item: Text_1

We have had a lot of discussion recently about oil change intervals recently 
just about all of it driven by emotion not fact. As a relatively new owner (5 
months) of a relatively old (1986) 930 I am about to change my tranny oil both 
as prep for drivers ed. and as part of my twice yearly ritual. What I really 
need to know is whether there are any FACTS on which to base a choice of 
manufacturer or type ('natural' or synthetic?
For your info I choose my brand mainly by emotion. When I first owned an i.c.e. 
powered vehicle one od-ed on the smell of Castrol R so Castrol it had to be. 
Then my favorite Rally teams started to use Duckham's so I changed. When I moved
to good old Cinci, being 10 years behind the rest of the world meant no more of 
either so I switched to unknown brands like Quaker State and Valvolene. I am 
convinced that my Detroit V8 which couldn't pull the skin off boiled milk wore a
lot faster and sludged up more than the hotter little guys I had been used to. 
When Castrol became available here I switched back and my Fierro V6 never seemed
to wear or sludge much. However no facts............
It would also seem to me that the cost of synthetics and fancy brands (swepco) 
have a very poor price/performance ratio. I can get about four changes of 
Castrol dino base for the cost of one fancy oil, surely this would be a lot 
better for the mechanicals, especially with all of those little particles and 
gas and what not that Stan reminded us about floating about in the oil?
Any one have any facts? the facts man, just the facts..........

Hi,

I have a 93 RS America - my dream come true - but also have 3 kids

I am told that all the late model 911's have common mounting for the 
back seat.  Does anyone know if this is actually true?

Either way, is any one out there parting out a 911 who wishes to sell 
the back seat?  My RS has black cloth upholstery but I could get it 
recovered if necessary.

Well, as for facts, synthetics offer superior lubrication and better
viscosity characteristics, but they get just as dirty and contaminated as
any other oil.

I would use synthetic in a 930 (especially an early one) because synthetics
are much more resistant to "coking" (getting fried by turbo heat, and thus
leaving deposits on turbo bearings, leading to more turbo maintenance,
leading to thin wallet <grin>).

Your oil-change interval is up to you.. because it depends on *your*
driving. The only sure way to know is to get the oil tested (not a bad idea
in any case, but a bit expensive, as has been pointed out). The penalty for
over-due changes is pretty high, though.

One case where synthetics are clearly superior is in cold-weather startup.
If you live in an area like I do (and for your sake I hope you don't :), a
synthetic will actually save money over 5w30 dino in the winter if you're a
typical city commuter.

Assuming it's the same as my 924 (which I am in the midst of),
you gently pull off the door liners and the switches are spring
mounted; they just pop off.  The switch top pops right off, spilling
little ball bearings and stuff.  If you want to cope with that, you
might be able to pry the switch out without removing the liner but
I wouldn't recommend it.

Once the switch is out, popping the top off and cleaning out the innards
is trivial.  I used brake cleaner, then WD40 in mine and now the windows
go up and down.

Subject: Re : 7x16 Fuchs on '71 911

Hi Mike,

Thanks for the reply.

I did have an opportunity to try the wheels in question as you suggested.
My results were wierd to say the least. . .

The 7x16 with 225/50's were *way* to big on the back.  They actually stuck
out from underneath the wheel wells!  Attmpting to drive the car would have
probably resulted in crunched fenders and ruined tires!  They did fit on
the front but the looked really goofy.

The 6x16 with 205/55's fit well on the back, but here is where it gets
wierd.  The left wheel stuck out approx 1.5 cm further than the right wheel
on my 911.  At first I thought that the offset on these wheels *must* be
different.  Nope, same offset.

My car has never been crunched so that can't be the problem.  It tracks
well and tires wear out fairly evenly so alignment must be OK.  Then I got
to thinking that Porsches are, for the most part, handmade so there must be
some variation in the tolerances.  I wouldn't expect 1.5 cm though.

The point is moot though since I've decided that I don't really like that
"muscular" look on my car.  This in part because the black centers on the
16" wheels make my tangerene 911 look somewhat pumpkin like.

So, given the L to R difference on the rear and my desire to reduce the
pumpkin look, I've decided to look for some 6x15's with silver/polished on
black spokes and I'll probably go with 195/65's all around. They won't give
the grip of the 205/55 16's, but they will ride better, wear longer and
they will probably extend the limit of my car *way* beyond my ability.  At
least for a little while. :-}

Your suggestion about the 911R wheels is good, but I don't think I could
find them anywhere.  I understand they are extremely rare and therefore
very expensive.

Take care,

  Hello Pphiles!
  Well, just about the time I get my license plate put on my new 944, 
I now find that I have a coolant leak.
  At first I thought it must be the H2O pump.  The leak, from looking
under the car, appeared to be underneath where the pump is located, but
further back.  The coolant comes down near the back end of the 
plate/"shield" at the bottom of the engine.  (through the last two "vents"
and off the back edge).  I checked the water pump, and I couldn't couldn't
see/feel any water coming from it. (hoses were dry and gasket seal appeared
to be intact-no coolant).
  I tried taking off the under plate/"shield" but couldn't get it off -
I must be missing some connection besides the two scresws and two bolts.
Could it be the block drain plug or something in that area?  Is there a bolt
or screw that I am missing to take the under plate off?  Any Ideas?

Thanks in Advance!

Subject: Porsche Mechanics FAQ



  While reading this list, I have noticed many request for information
on mechanics and "reputable" places of business.  (I guess you might say
it is a frequently asked question ;)
  So... what I was thinkin' was that we should have a FAQ for it. I will
volunteer to compile the list, but I need info.
  If anyone has any suggestions as to the design of the FAQ, I am open
to suggestions.  
  As for the information  that might be useful, I was thinking:
General Location (SouthWest,West,NorthWest,Heartland,etc - or PCA region)
City
Address
Name
Description of past experiences/prices/quality of work etc.
Anything else you might think is interesting.

So send me any/all and I will start compiling.  I will post it as soon as
it becomes worthwhile :)

I also think $15 is too cheap for the great service Stan provides. How about
this: If all 135 interested participants (or whatever it's up to by now)
pitch in $50, we've almost made it.  If the number is already at 150, Stan
gets new race tires, too!  After all, that's what this list is all about,
*sharing* in the Porsche experience, right?

I'll pledge $50.

Subject: YAOQ-Yet another oil question

Given that one *is* changing one's oil every 5000kms, and one attends the
odd track event... should one, in addition:

        a. change the oil before a track event?
        b. change the oil after a track event?
        c. neither... just stick with the every 5000kms rule
        d. change the oil both before and after a track event.

It doesn't seem obvious to me, unlike changing brake fluid. The safe answer
is d., but I'm leaning towards c., in the absence of new knowledge. If one
had a carbureted car, I guess b. would make sense, to eliminate gasoline
introduced into the oil system by constant introduction of full-throttle,
but that should be negligible on a street-oriented car, anyways.

I think that this is a noble thought, but I for one can't afford to pitch 
in $50.  Being a 'poor college student' I know that $50 will feed me for 
some time.  On the other hand I do appriciate how much Stan puts into the 
list.  Though I have just joined about 3 months ago, and as of yet own no 
P-car, I expect to someday and hope that this list will be around when I 
do.  Therefore I will double my origional pledge of $15.  I hope that 
nobody feels like they can't contribute because they can't put in the 
'$50.'  If everybody does what they can I am sure that we can help Stan 
out.  In short nothing should be 'too cheap,' (kind of cheesy but..) 
every drop counts.

So if the number is the design number, then why did Porsche get stuck in

boom, once they hit 900 everything seemed to click.

Ligth bulbs work by causing an energy change in something.  This energy

I was going to buy the Porsche repair manuals (before learning the price).  Much
to my surprise, the microfilm version of the shop manuals is very cheap.  I 
bought
the film, used, for $20, and a reader for $70.  The film covers all models from
1978-1989 (all country variations, also).  It is a photographic duplicate of the
printed manuals.

As for the Chilton's book:  I find it usefull for its brief and clear 
descriptions,
but it is lacking in many sections;  it cops out by saying that certain work 
must
only be attempted by qualified repair personnel (and, with this excuse, it 
simply
will not tell you what you need to know--as if you might injure yourself, or 
your
car, out of your own stupidity).

I don't know of how much use this will be to you, but I had the same problem 
with
my 928 glove box.  Mine was sun damaged (warped and starting to crack).  My dash
is leather, and presumeably, so was my glove box door.  I priced a new 
leather glove
box door at $600!  I decided to pass up this incredible bargain, and purchase a
vinyl one for $100.  The vinyl one matches my leather dash pretty well.  Others
mistake it for leather.  I guess the point is, if you can't tell the difference,
why pay the difference?  My recommendation is:  (1) Determine if you dash is 
leather
(try scraping it with a knife blade in a hidden spot, and see if it roughs 
up like
leather).  (2) If it is leather, try to find a used leather glove box door 
for under
$200.  (3) If you can't find a used one, either pay the price for a new leather
one (ouch!), or try to match a vinyl one (seems a shame, but there are 
better things
on which to spend that extra $500).

Well, it depends. On the race cars, they get oil changes before every
day that they go onto the track, at after the end of the last day of
being on the track for a given weekend.

That typically means after Friday practice, after the race on Saturday
and Sunday. 

For a street car, I'd change oil after the track event even if I just
changed the oil before the track event. Remember, the main goal is to
remove crap from the engine, so after is better than before unless
the oil is really ugly before...

You need "the" reference book on all this stuff -- the Bosch Automotive
Handbook. It has all the definitions, all the conversions, and a ton
of useful formulas and capsule explainations of the theory, etc.

Available at many of the aftermarket suppliers for about $30, it's a

Subject: 912 Problem





     OK, guys- here's a True Story- one that happened this Monday-

and was an exercise in Porsche Problem Solving. See ifin you can

get the correct answer:

     The jinx, er, car in question was a 1969 912 that the owner

brought in smoking, leaking, and clutch-slipping.

     So, the Maestro grabbed one of his rebuilt '69 912 engines

off the shelf and stuck it into the owner's engine bay. Fired it up 

and voila- a nice-running, leak-free, power plant with a 

working clutch even. The owner was happy. The Maestro was happy. 

Everybody was happy! 

    A week later, last Sunday night in fact, the guy calls- he 

had broken down a few miles from the Maestro's shop, and was having 

the car towed over! The new engine had been running fine down the 

freeway, but when he pulled off to get gas, he heard a horrible 

grinding sound from the engine, followed by the Sound of Silence. 

   He tried to restart, but all he got was a "click" from

the starter. He tried to push-start it, but the ENGINE WOULDN'T 

TURN OVER! It was "seized", he said! 

     Bright and Early Monday Morning, the melancholy

Maestro made it to the shop. And sho' 'nough- there was the 

cursed 912 waiting for him- it's rust-filled front end grinnin' 

an evil grin. Sigh. 

    The Maestro got the keys that had been stuffed through

the mailbox slot, traipsed to the car like a man to the gallows, 

and tried to start it up. No go- the starter clicked weakly and 

that was it- it was just like the Gasoline Hammer Effect,...

or a seized engine! 

    The Maestro unhappily pushed it into his Shop. And hooked up 

a fresh 12 Volt battery to the beastie- and tried again. 

Still nothing- just a slightly longer "click" from the starter. 

  The Maestro got out his Metric Adjustible Wrench, attached it 

to the pulley nut and tried to turn the engine over. No go. 

No turnee. The pulley wouldn't turn either way! 

    Moan! Groan! Beseech the Porsche gods. Break the Emergency Virgin

Case and sacrifice one to the gods. Still no go.

The engine refused to turn over with the Starter or a wrench on the

pulley nut!

Engine that was at fault!)

your losses and roll your gains is the maxim being applied here I think.

I like all Porsche, the luxo barge <g> and other water
pumping variants are cool, and am sorry to seem them go, but the 
new company strategy seems to be to develop a core of related products (ie 
boxer-engined sports cars, from entry level to high-performance 
Ferrari bashers), to replace the existing incoherent "model range" 
(hotch-potch?) of somewhat ageing and wildly different cars.

Just my $0.02, I expect fully to be proven totally wrong <g>

Well, it depends. On the race cars, they get oil changes before every
day that they go onto the track, at after the end of the last day of
being on the track for a given weekend.

That typically means after Friday practice, after the race on Saturday
and Sunday. 

For a street car, I'd change oil after the track event even if I just
changed the oil before the track event. Remember, the main goal is to
remove crap from the engine, so after is better than before unless
the oil is really ugly before...

You need "the" reference book on all this stuff -- the Bosch Automotive
Handbook. It has all the definitions, all the conversions, and a ton
of useful formulas and capsule explainations of the theory, etc.

Available at many of the aftermarket suppliers for about $30, it's a
great investment in your automotive education.

Subject: 912 Problem





     OK, guys- here's a True Story- one that happened this Monday-

and was an exercise in Porsche Problem Solving. See ifin you can

get the correct answer:

     The jinx, er, car in question was a 1969 912 that the owner

brought in smoking, leaking, and clutch-slipping.

     So, the Maestro grabbed one of his rebuilt '69 912 engines

off the shelf and stuck it into the owner's engine bay. Fired it up 

and voila- a nice-running, leak-free, power plant with a 

working clutch even. The owner was happy. The Maestro was happy. 

Everybody was happy! 

    A week later, last Sunday night in fact, the guy calls- he 

had broken down a few miles from the Maestro's shop, and was having 

the car towed over! The new engine had been running fine down the 

freeway, but when he pulled off to get gas, he heard a horrible 

grinding sound from the engine, followed by the Sound of Silence. 

   He tried to restart, but all he got was a "click" from

the starter. He tried to push-start it, but the ENGINE WOULDN'T 

TURN OVER! It was "seized", he said! 

     Bright and Early Monday Morning, the melancholy

Maestro made it to the shop. And sho' 'nough- there was the 

cursed 912 waiting for him- it's rust-filled front end grinnin' 

an evil grin. Sigh. 

    The Maestro got the keys that had been stuffed through

the mailbox slot, traipsed to the car like a man to the gallows, 

and tried to start it up. No go- the starter clicked weakly and 

that was it- it was just like the Gasoline Hammer Effect,...

or a seized engine! 

    The Maestro unhappily pushed it into his Shop. And hooked up 

a fresh 12 Volt battery to the beastie- and tried again. 

Still nothing- just a slightly longer "click" from the starter. 

  The Maestro got out his Metric Adjustible Wrench, attached it 

to the pulley nut and tried to turn the engine over. No go. 

No turnee. The pulley wouldn't turn either way! 

    Moan! Groan! Beseech the Porsche gods. Break the Emergency Virgin

Case and sacrifice one to the gods. Still no go.

The engine refused to turn over with the Starter or a wrench on the

pulley nut! 

 

   Question: What was wrong? (Hint: No Pete, it WASN'T the Maestro's

Engine that was at fault!)

| I can see  how the 928 could have problems with value/price positioning

| I guess it's now caught on a sand bank.  I wonder why they never lowered

| ask for 80K+ a copy after delivery, dealer margin, etc., does it?

>From what I remember of visiting The Factory, about 1 or 2 928 are built
each day. You can't get much lower volume car production than that. The
lower the volume the higher the fixed costs per unit, OK they might have 
amortised off all the plant and tools since the 928 is 15 or so 
years old. Even so, building one car per day, not on a production line, 
mainly by hand is a *very* expensive process. Also, don't forget that 
labour, a significant component, is expensive in Europe. Also,
don't forget that Porsche actually make a tiny proportion of the 
components of their cars. In fact, the only thing that they really
fabricate is the leather interior, most everything else comes
in from outside manufacturers, I hate to think of the cost of
the 300 or so 928 aluminium blocks, crankshafts, camshafts or
cylinder heads required each year, in very low volume production runs. 
Ouch!

If the 928 and 968 made any significant money for Porsche, then 
I would expect them to bash them out as fast as possible. As it is,
the 993 in various forms makes up the greatest proportion of
production at Porsche, and one would presume, is the product
that is pushing Porsche back to being a viable business. Cut
your losses and roll your gains is the maxim being applied here I think.

I like all Porsche, the luxo barge <g> and other water
pumping variants are cool, and am sorry to seem them go, but the 
new company strategy seems to be to develop a core of related products (ie 
boxer-engined sports cars, from entry level to high-performance 
Ferrari bashers), to replace the existing incoherent "model range" 
(hotch-potch?) of somewhat ageing and wildly different cars.

Just my $0.02, I expect fully to be proven totally wrong <g>

Hi John,

Neat story.  Takes me back to sunny Saigon, where everyone drove stolen
jeeps.  The principal difference between Newbies and old hands was the 
possession of a stolen Jeep.  Even those who were *issued* jeeps.  It was
sort of a rite of passage, and worked like this.

Newbie gets issued jeep, M1A1, one each.
Newbie takes jeep into Saigon, parks and locks same.
Newbie goes into Bar/Restaurant/Steam bath/Military Facility (take your pick).
Newbie comes back out to find jeep gone.
Old hands let newbie in on secret, *all* jeeps in use in Saigon are Stolen.
Newbie returns to Saigon and finds replacement, is now "old hand".
Old hand paints new bumper numbers on jeep, takes jeep to Saigon, parks same 
     and removes coil wire.
     [...too many time passes...] (no, that's not a misprint...)
Old hand comes out and finds jeep gone.  (using old coil wire) obtains *new*
    Jeep. 
Etc.

How can I put it? T*d was a legend in his own mind, A rebel

of warnings and good people were bailing out to keep from having
their computer space polluted by the guy several times a day.
Stan finally did the right thing - it was a mercy killing, honest.

Subject: power steering


I'm doing winter maintenance on my '84 928S and am considering flushing the power steering hydraulic fluid.  The shop manual has no information on this 
procedure - is it unnecessary?  I just recently bought the car; it has 61K miles and I must assume that this was never done.

There is a section on bleeding the system, but nothing on draining.  Any suggestions?  I thought I would just disconnect the pressure hose and run the pump 
until nothing comes out while turning the wheel.  Do I risk burning up the pump?  Also, I couldn't find a torque specification for the pressure hose in the 
manual (I may have overlooked it).

Any comments?  Is there a fluid change interval?  If I flush now, I probably won't flush for 4+ years (40,000 miles).

   If your dashboard is warped, its Porsche Leather. If its cracked, its
 Porsche Vinyl.

   Likely your dash is leather if your door panels, headliner, center
 console and rear inner quarters are also leather. Vinyl looks pebbly
 and leather looks grainy. Chances are if you have the velour art deco
 interior then (lucky you) the only leather in the car is the shift boot.  

   Porsche cannot make dashes worth crap, but their vinyl dashes hold out
 10 times better than their leather-covered ones and the "full leather"
 option is a regrettable choice.

I am not sure what the final format will, but I will get a better idea when I
recieve your input. A comments section will appear at the end of the form for
any additional information you can provide. When completed, it make for some
interested reading, for those who may have a common problem, or would just
like to hear other owners comments and problems, without having to search all
the past archives.

  The more info I recieve the more accurate the survey. Please try to
help if you can. This would be a great addition to the FAQ!

Once I have the compilied the past section of the owners survey, I will
update the the owners report from time to time. This will then be posted

Subject: Oil filters (was oil interval)

Hey P-filers,

The thread about oil change intervals brought to mind my 
father's thoughts on the subject. He believes in changing 
the oil often, but contends that the filter need only be
changed every other oil change (which would put it at 
the regular recommended interval, or half that, depending
upon how often one changes oil). This seems to make sense,
since the filter is probably designed to handle the longer
interval. The main problem that I see is in 'contamination'
of the new oil with the old filter and remnant oil.

Is there merit to this or is it just New England parsimony 
showing through?

Regards,

Rob Yasek

Even at Porsche, I knew lots of great mechanics who did not use the official
tensioning tool on some of our experimental engines, even though it was
readily available. They thought it was pretty mickey mouse and just did it
by feel. We never lost a belt, even with 600 hour full-throttle endurance
tests. Lost some other unrelated stuff though. These were non-Porsche engines.

How were you able to check the pump without removing the belt covers?
It has been my exprience that you can't see much of the pump to make a
true evaluation unless you remove the belts and covers. Lot's of work!

>I must be missing some connection besides the two scresws and two bolts.

The shield is held in place by 7 bolts (10mm socket). 2 in front, 3 into
the crossmember (at the rear of the belly pan), an one each on the
side, by the chassis longitudinals...

Look for h20 leaks at the bottom of your timing belt covers. Water runs down
the back of the cover, and gets pushed by the air flow backwards. It will get
your sway bar wet, drip on the belly pan and flow back towards the
rear. There is drain plug by the exhaust manifold, hard to see or get to, but
I doubt that this is leaking.

Also, check the hoses that connect to the heater valve, right next to the 
brake booster. Hoses and valve could be leaking. They will drip by the clutch
housing and travel to the bottom...

Don't ask how I know about these things...:))))

Hope it helps!

I consider the above a public service announcement. Please keep the pledges
coming. If need be the dogs will get only one skoop of Iams (low fat type),
no popcorn and killer food at the movies, Luigi's will not see us this weekend, 
and the best part -the trip to NYC to see my ...MIL is off. I think that will
do it for me. Do your own inventory of needs and cut out the fat for one/two
days.

<Jay writes, "How do I keep my 951 alive, it has 127,000 miles on it <and I
do track events

Jay,
You'll love the TA's. They really stick and are extremely stiff so you don't
want to go overboard on the camber. The numbers I gave you should be fine and
streetable also.
To keep you're turbo alive you need to do the rod bearings ASAP unless you
are sure of the cars' history. For example if it always used synthetic oil
and it always was changed at every 5000 miles and didn't spend allot of time
on the track and it never got low then I would say perhaps take a chance. If
not then get the bearings done. I know it's a major hit but trashing an
engine is allot worse and peace of mind is importatant when you are in a
situation the demands concentration.
To keep it alive after that I offer these suggestions,
1. Use synthetic oil
2. change it before every track event and every 5000 miles if no events.
3. ALWAYS keep it 1/2 quart high. (check after every run group)
4. If the temp gauge ever gets into the h his 911 as a demonstration of his driving prowess

8   Locked his keys in 911 with engine running, calls SO to
    bring spare keys, can't find them, breaks window (with head I expect)
    to get in. Wonders why everyone laughed at this story

9.  Claims Japanese sports cars are "better" than Porsche

10. Caused Stan to write three warnings including including the
    classic

   | Ted,
   |
   | I've had about enough of this crap. 

11. Started his own 911 email list, because Porschephiles not good enough
    for him, enrolled lots of porschephiles members without asking!

12. Autocrossed his 911 with four different tyres, including different
    sizes and manufaturers on the same axle!

13. Proved himself unable to stay on the course while autocrossing and
    clocked up times that could be beaten by a man with one leg on
    on a bicycle.

14. Was banned from the list due to massive public demand, then mail bombed
    list and individuals causing the list to be shut down for two
    days while emergency anti-Ted filters set up.

15. Wasted the Listmeisters time.

Craig,
I don't have any real reason for doing this other than peer pressure but I
change my oil before every track event. I feel (in an anthropomorphic way)
that cars are like people. They perform better with a drink of fresh blood.
I also have this fear, because I've seen this happen, that I will blow an
engine and the first question that people will ask is "When is the last time
you changed your oil?"

Hi John,

Neat story.  Takes me back to sunny Saigon, where everyone drove stolen
jeeps.  The principal difference between Newbies and old hands was the 
possession of a stolen Jeep.  Even those who were *issued* jeeps.  It was
sort of a rite of passage, and worked like this.

Newbie gets issued jeep, M1A1, one each.
Newbie takes jeep into Saigon, parks and locks same.
Newbie goes into Bar/Restaurant/Steam bath/Military Facility (take your pick).
Newbie comes back out to find jeep gone.
Old hands let newbie in on secret, *all* jeeps in use in Saigon are Stolen.
Newbie returns to Saigon and finds replacement, is now "old hand".
Old hand paints new bumper numbers on jeep, takes jeep to Saigon, parks same 
     and removes coil wire.
     [...too many time passes...] (no, that's not a misprint...)
Old hand comes out and finds jeep gone.  (using old coil wire) obtains *new*
    Jeep. 
Etc.

(sigh...)  War is Hell...

I'm doing winter maintenance on my '84 928S and am considering flushing the power steering hydraulic fluid.  The shop manual has no information on this 
procedure - is it unnecessary?  I just recently bought the car; it has 61K miles and I must assume that this was never done.

There is a section on bleeding the system, but nothing on draining.  Any suggestions?  I thought I would just disconnect the pressure hose and run the pump 
until nothing comes out while turning the wheel.  Do I risk burning up the pump?  Also, I couldn't find a torque specification for the pressure hose in the 
manual (I may have overlooked it).

Any comments?  Is there a fluid change interval?  If I flush now, I probably won't flush for 4+ years (40,000 miles).

   If your dashboard is warped, its Porsche Leather. If its cracked, its

   Likely your dash is leather if your door panels, headliner, center
 console and rear inner quarters are also leather. Vinyl looks pebbly
 and leather looks grainy. Chances are if you have the velour art deco
 interior then (lucky you) the only leather in the car is the shift boot.  

   Porsche cannot make dashes worth crap, but their vinyl dashes hold out
 10 times better than their leather-covered ones and the "full leather"
 option is a regrettable choice.

Hello All,

I am trying to prepare a owners report survey for the new 924/944/968 FAQ.
The purpose of the survey is to collect maintenance and repair records for the
924/944/968 series. I am including a form to make data input easier for you.

I am not sure what the final format will, but I will get a better idea when I
recieve your input. A comments section will appear at the end of the form for
any additional information you can provide. When completed, it make for some
interested reading, for those who may have a common problem, or would just
like to hear other owners comments and problems, without having to search all
the past archives.

  The more info I recieve the more accurate the survey. Please try to
help if you can. This would be a great addition to the FAQ!

Once I have the compilied the past section of the owners survey, I will
update the the owners report from time to time. This will then be posted
to the FAQ .(also to the list so all can see the results)

The completed form can be sent to me directly for review. DO NOT SEND TO

Subject: Oil filters (was oil interval)

Hey P-filers,

The thread about oil change intervals brought to mind my 
father's thoughts on the subject. He believes in changing 
the oil often, but contends that the filter need only be
changed every other oil change (which would put it at 
the regular recommended interval, or half that, depending
upon how often one changes oil). This seems to make sense,
since the filter is probably designed to handle the longer
interval. The main problem that I see is in 'contamination'
of the new oil with the old filter and remnant oil.

Is there merit to this or is it just New England parsimony 
showing through?

Even at Porsche, I knew lots of great mechanics who did not use the official
tensioning tool on some of our experimental engines, even though it was
readily available. They thought it was pretty mickey mouse and just did it
by feel. We never lost a belt, even with 600 hour full-throttle endurance
tests. Lost some other unrelated stuff though. These were non-Porsche engines.

How were you able to check the pump without removing the belt covers?
It has been my exprience that you can't see much of the pump to make a
true evaluation unless you remove the belts and covers. Lot's of work!

The shield is held in place by 7 bolts (10mm socket). 2 in front, 3 into
the crossmember (at the rear of the belly pan), an one each on the
side, by the chassis longitudinals...

Look for h20 leaks at the bottom of your timing belt covers. Water runs down
the back of the cover, and gets pushed by the air flow backwards. It will get
your sway bar wet, drip on the belly pan and flow back towards the
rear. There is drain plug by the exhaust manifold, hard to see or get to, but
I doubt that this is leaking.

Also, check the hoses that connect to the heater valve, right next to the 
brake booster. Hoses and valve could be leaking. They will drip by the clutch
housing and travel to the bottom...

Don't ask how I know about these things...:))))

Hope it helps!

Jay,
You'll love the TA's. They really stick and are extremely stiff so you don't
want to go overboard on the camber. The numbers I gave you should be fine and
streetable also.
To keep you're turbo alive you need to do the rod bearings ASAP unless you
are sure of the cars' history. For example if it always used synthetic oil
and it always was changed at every 5000 miles and didn't spend allot of time
on the track and it never got low then I would say perhaps take a chance. If
not then get the bearings done. I know it's a major hit but trashing an
engine is allot worse and peace of mind is importatant when you are in a
situation the demands concentration.
To keep it alive after that I offer these suggestions,
1. Use synthetic oil
2. change it before every track event and every 5000 miles if no events.
3. ALWAYS keep it 1/2 quart high. (check after every run group)
4. If the temp gauge ever gets into the high range shut it down and find out
what is wrong.
5. Use 93 octane gas always.
6. Don't put a chip in it. You WILL blow a head gasket, thereby getting water
in the oil and necessitating another bearing change.
I could go on and on about chips but that is another topic for another day.
BTW I didn't know that turn 4 was a real turn, I always treated it as a place
to lift a little and turn in. Actually having slid sideways down the chute
once I do treat that area with a great deal of respect. I do brake a bit
there.
Got to pack, leaving for Sebring at 4 this afternoon. I'll let you know what

Subject: Oil filters (was oil interval)

Hey P-filers,

The thread about oil change intervals brought to mind my 
father's thoughts on the subject. He believes in changing 
the oil often, but contends that the filter need only be
changed every other oil change (which would put it at 
the regular recommended interval, or half that, depending
upon how often one changes oil). This seems to make sense,
since the filter is probably designed to handle the longer
interval. The main problem that I see is in 'contamination'
of the new oil with the old filter and remnant oil.

Is there merit to this or is it just New England parsimony 
showing through?

Regards,

Rob Yasek

I had full leather interiors with leather sport seats in my 81, 84 and 85

adjusted. I liked the 81 sport seat design best of all.

Even at Porsche, I knew lots of great mechanics who did not use the official
tensioning tool on some of our experimental engines, even though it was
readily available. They thought it was pretty mickey mouse and just did it
by feel. We never lost a belt, even with 600 hour full-throttle endurance
tests. Lost some other unrelated stuff though. These were non-Porsche engines.

How were you able to check the pump without removing the belt covers?
It has been my exprience that you can't see much of the pump to make a
true evaluation unless you remove the belts and covers. Lot's of work!

The shield is held in place by 7 bolts (10mm socket). 2 in front, 3 into
the crossmember (at the rear of the belly pan), an one each on the
side, by the chassis longitudinals...

Look for h20 leaks at the bottom of your timing belt covers. Water runs down
the back of the cover, and gets pushed by the air flow backwards. It will get
your sway bar wet, drip on the belly pan and flow back towards the
rear. There is drain plug by the exhaust manifold, hard to see or get to, but
I doubt that this is leaking.

Also, check the hoses that connect to the heater valve, right next to the 
brake booster. Hoses and valve could be leaking. They will drip by the clutch
housing and travel to the bottom...

Don't ask how I know about these things...:))))

Hope it helps!

I consider the above a public service announcement. Please keep the pledges

no popcorn and killer food at the movies, Luigi's will not see us this weekend, 
and the best part -the trip to NYC to see my ...MIL is off. I think that will

<Jay writes, "How do I keep my 951 alive, it has 127,000 miles on it <and I

Jay,
You'll love the TA's. They really stick and are extremely stiff so you don't
want to go overboard on the camber. The numbers I gave you should be fine and
streetable also.
To keep you're turbo alive you need to do the rod bearings ASAP unless you
are sure of the cars' history. For example if it always used synthetic oil
and it always was changed at every 5000 miles and didn't spend allot of time
on the track and it never got low then I would say perhaps take a chance. If
not then get the bearings done. I know it's a major hit but trashing an
engine is allot worse and peace of mind is importatant when you are in a
situation the demands concentration.
To keep it alive after that I offer these suggestions,
1. Use synthetic oil
2. change it before every track event and every 5000 miles if no events.
3. ALWAYS keep it 1/2 quart high. (check after every run group)
4. If the temp gauge ever gets into the high range shut it down and find out
what is wrong.
5. Use 93 octane gas always.
6. Don't put a chip in it. You WILL blow a head gasket, thereby getting water
in the oil and necessitating another bearing change.
I could go on and on about chips but that is another topic for another day.
BTW I didn't know that turn 4 was a real turn, I always treated it as a place
to lift a little and turn in. Actually having slid sideways down the chute
once I do treat that area with a great deal of respect. I do brake a bit
there.
Got to pack, leaving for Sebring at 4 this afternoon. I'll let you know what
happens

If it's tough for you to fix, imagine what the dealer will charge you to do

jacked the front of the car up and went from underneath, still wasn't easy! 
 There are some hoses and some plastic pieces, somewhere it was clogged. 
 Blowing compressed air through it cleared it up for me.

If you take the carpeted side panel off from the side of the console you can

Well, it depends. On the race cars, they get oil changes before every
day that they go onto the track, at after the end of the last day of
being on the track for a given weekend.

That typically means after Friday practice, after the race on Saturday
and Sunday. 

For a street car, I'd change oil after the track event even if I just
changed the oil before the track event. Remember, the main goal is to
remove crap from the engine, so after is better than before unless
the oil is really ugly before...

Subject: 912 Problem





     OK, guys- here's a True Story- one that happened this Monday-

and was an exercise in Porsche Problem Solving. See ifin you can

get the correct answer:

     The jinx, er, car in question was a 1969 912 that the owner

brought in smoking, leaking, and clutch-slipping.

     So, the Maestro grabbed one of his rebuilt '69 912 engines

off the shelf and stuck it into the owner's engine bay. Fired it up 

and voila- a nice-running, leak-free, power plant with a 

working clutch even. The owner was happy. The Maestro was happy. 

Everybody was happy! 

    A week later, last Sunday night in fact, the guy calls- he 

had broken down a few miles from the Maestro's shop, and was having 

the car towed over! The new engine had been running fine down the 

freeway, but when he pulled off to get gas, he heard a horrible 

grinding sound from the engine, followed by the Sound of Silence. 

   He tried to restart, but all he got was a "click" from

the starter. He tried to push-start it, but the ENGINE WOULDN'T 

TURN OVER! It was "seized", he said! 

     Bright and Early Monday Morning, the melancholy

Maestro made it to the shop. And sho' 'nough- there was the 

cursed 912 waiting for him- it's rust-filled front end grinnin' 

an evil grin. Sigh. 

    The Maestro got the keys that had been stuffed through

the mailbox slot, traipsed to the car like a man to the gallows, 

and tried to start it up. No go- the starter clicked weakly and 

that was it- it was just like the Gasoline Hammer Effect,...

or a seized engine! 

    The Maestro unhappily pushed it into his Shop. And hooked up 

a fresh 12 Volt battery to the beastie- and tried again. 

Still nothing- just a slightly longer "click" from the starter. 

  The Maestro got out his Metric Adjustible Wrench, attached it 

to the pulley nut and tried to turn the engine over. No go. 

No turnee. The pulley wouldn't turn either way! 

    Moan! Groan! Beseech the Porsche gods. Break the Emergency Virgin

Case and sacrifice one to the gods. Still no go.

The engine refused to turn over with the Starter or a wrench on the

pulley nut!

Engine that was at fault!)

each day. You can't get much lower volume car production than that. The
lower the volume the higher the fixed costs per unit, OK they might have 
amortised off all the plant and tools since the 928 is 15 or so 
years old. Even so, building one car per day, not on a production line, 
mainly by hand is a *very* expensive process. Also, don't forget that 
labour, a significant component, is expensive in Europe. Also,
don't forget that Porsche actually make a tiny proportion of the 
components of their cars. In fact, the only thing that they really
fabricate is the leather interior, most everything else comes
in from outside manufacturers, I hate to think of the cost of
the 300 or so 928 aluminium blocks, crankshafts, camshafts or
cylinder heads required each year, in very low volume production runs. 
Ouch!

If the 928 and 968 made any significant money for Porsche, then 
I would expect them to bash them out as fast as possible. As it is,
the 993 in various forms makes up the greatest proportion of
production at Porsche, and one would presume, is the product
that is pushing Porsche back to being a viable business. Cut
your losses and roll your gains is the maxim being applied here I think.

I like all Porsche, the luxo barge <g> and other water
pumping variants are cool, and am sorry to seem them go, but the 
new company strategy seems to be to develop a core of related products (ie 
boxer-engined sports cars, from entry level to high-performance 
Ferrari bashers), to replace the existing incoherent "model range" 
(hotch-potch?) of somewhat ageing and wildly different cars.

Just my $0.02, I expect fully to be proven totally wrong <g>

As an historian of the ousting of T*d M, I would like
to recount the following incidents for the edification of those

list and caused heated flame wars on many subject including
the following crimes:


1.  Claimed skinny tyres and wheels always improve 911 handling

2.  Claimed racing on public roads was k00L

3.  Suggested that "the English is all screwed up" in the
    Haynes manual, causes much hilarity here in Europe, seems
    totally unaware that his dialect is not commonly spoken in 
    the English speaking world.

4.  Empirically demonstrated that early 911 power to weight
    ratio was superior to late model, once his math error
    was corrected, evidence contradicted his claim. Then suggests
    that power to weight ratio was unimportant in 911 performance.

5.  Unable to accept that he was wrong on any technical matter
    even when presented with factual evidence

6.  Claimed cheapo Wall-mart shocks better and longer lasting
    Bilstein or Koni.

7.  Kerb surfed his 911 as a demonstration of his driving prowess

8   Locked his keys in 911 with engine running, calls SO to
    bring spare keys, can't find them, breaks window (with head I expect)
    to get in. Wonders why everyone laughed at this story

9.  Claims Japanese sports cars are "better" than Porsche

10. Caused Stan to write three warnings including including the
    classic

   | Ted,
   |
   | I've had about enough of this crap. 

11. Started his own 911 email list, because Porschephiles not good enough
    for him, enrolled lots of porschephiles members without asking!

12. Autocrossed his 911 with four different tyres, including different
    sizes and manufaturers on the same axle!

13. Proved himself unable to stay on the course while autocrossing and
    clocked up times that could be beaten by a man with one leg on
    on a bicycle.

14. Was banned from the list due to massive public demand, then mail bombed
    list and individuals causing the list to be shut down for two
    days while emergency anti-Ted filters set up.

15. Wasted the Listmeisters time.

Neat story.  Takes me back to sunny Saigon, where everyone drove stolen
jeeps.  The principal difference between Newbies and old hands was the 
possession of a stolen Jeep.  Even those who were *issued* jeeps.  It was
sort of a rite of passage, and worked like this.

Newbie gets issued jeep, M1A1, one each.
Newbie takes jeep into Saigon, parks and locks same.
Newbie goes into Bar/Restaurant/Steam bath/Military Facility (take your pick).
Newbie comes back out to find jeep gone.
Old hands let newbie in on secret, *all* jeeps in use in Saigon are Stolen.
Newbie returns to Saigon and finds replacement, is now "old hand".
Old hand paints new bumper numbers on jeep, takes jeep to Saigon, parks same 
     and removes coil wire.
     [...too many time passes...] (no, that's not a misprint...)
Old hand comes out and finds jeep gone.  (using old coil wire) obtains *new*
    Jeep. 
Etc.

Hello!  As a new used-Porsche owner, I'm busily looking for parts & information
sources.  At the moment I'm trying to find a good price on a 944 Cam Belt Tool.
Or any information anyone may have about accurately tensioning the belt without
the Porsche tool.  There seems to be a definite lack of qualified & equipped
mechanics here, and the cheapest price I've seen yet was nearly $400 (about $600Can by the time I pay shipping, duty, taxes, etc.) 
Thanks!

===============
I bought the belt tool from Carlsen in CA for something like $369 a few weeks
ago. 1-800-523-2408. Ask for Linda. She knows about the net.

Not connected with them, but a satisfied customer...

How can I put it? T*d was a legend in his own mind, A rebel

their computer space polluted by the guy several times a day.
Stan finally did the right thing - it was a mercy killing, honest.

Subject: power steering


I'm doing winter maintenance on my '84 928S and am considering flushing the power steering hydraulic fluid.  The shop manual has no information on this 
procedure - is it unnecessary?  I just recently bought the car; it has 61K miles and I must assume that this was never done.

There is a section on bleeding the system, but nothing on draining.  Any suggestions?  I thought I would just disconnect the pressure hose and run the pump 
until nothing comes out while turning the wheel.  Do I risk burning up the pump?  Also, I couldn't find a torque specification for the pressure hose in the 
manual (I may have overlooked it).

Any comments?  Is there a fluid change interval?  If I flush now, I probably won't flush for 4+ years (40,000 miles).

   If your dashboard is warped, its Porsche Leather. If its cracked, its
 Porsche Vinyl.

   Likely your dash is leather if your door panels, headliner, center
 console and rear inner quarters are also leather. Vinyl looks pebbly
 and leather looks grainy. Chances are if you have the velour art deco
 interior then (lucky you) the only leather in the car is the shift boot.  

   Porsche cannot make dashes worth crap, but their vinyl dashes hold out
 10 times better than their leather-covered ones and the "full leather"
 option is a regrettable choice.

members that have already completed this survey need not do so again. If you 
would like to send me your current mileage that would be great, but it is not

******************************************************************************


Hello All,

I am trying to prepare a owners report survey for the new 924/944/968 FAQ.
The purpose of the survey is to collect maintenance and repair records for the
924/944/968 series. I am including a form to make data input easier for you.

I am not sure what the final format will, but I will get a better idea when I
recieve your input. A comments section will appear at the end of the form for
any additional information you can provide. When completed, it make for some
interested reading, for those who may have a common problem, or would just
like to hear other owners comments and problems, without having to search all
the past archives.

  The more info I recieve the more accurate the survey. Please try to
help if you can. This would be a great addition to the FAQ!

Once I have the compilied the past section of the owners survey, I will
update the the owners report from time to time. This will then be posted
to the FAQ .(also to the list so all can see the results)

The completed form can be sent to me directly for review. DO NOT SEND TO
ENTIRE LIST!!

Mike Kehr  INTERNET:71324.3010@compuserve.com

I was thinking that a mileage format would be a good idea ( repairs and 
maintance list by mileage, and a topic, format ie. Waterpumps, motor mounts, 
clutches etc. Any comments, let me know.

Subject: Oil filters (was oil interval)

Hey P-filers,

The thread about oil change intervals brought to mind my 
father's thoughts on the subject. He believes in changing 
the oil often, but contends that the filter need only be
changed every other oil change (which would put it at 
the regular recommended interval, or half that, depending
upon how often one changes oil). This seems to make sense,
since the filter is probably designed to handle the longer
interval. The main problem that I see is in 'contamination'
of the new oil with the old filter and remnant oil.

Is there merit to this or is it just New England parsimony 
showing through?

Rob Yasek

Even at Porsche, I knew lots of great mechanics who did not use the official
tensioning tool on some of our experimental engines, even though it was
readily available. They thought it was pretty mickey mouse and just did it
by feel. We never lost a belt, even with 600 hour full-throttle endurance
tests. Lost some other unrelated stuff though. These were non-Porsche engines.

How were you able to check the pump without removing the belt covers?
It has been my exprience that you can't see much of the pump to make a
true evaluation unless you remove the belts and covers. Lot's of work!

The shield is held in place by 7 bolts (10mm socket). 2 in front, 3 into
the crossmember (at the rear of the belly pan), an one each on the
side, by the chassis longitudinals...

Look for h20 leaks at the bottom of your timing belt covers. Water runs down
the back of the cover, and gets pushed by the air flow backwards. It will get
your sway bar wet, drip on the belly pan and flow back towards the
rear. There is drain plug by the exhaust manifold, hard to see or get to, but
I doubt that this is leaking.

Also, check the hoses that connect to the heater valve, right next to the 
brake booster. Hoses and valve could be leaking. They will drip by the clutch
housing and travel to the bottom...

Don't ask how I know about these things...:))))

Hope it helps!

I consider the above a public service announcement. Please keep the pledges

no popcorn and killer food at the movies, Luigi's will not see us this weekend,

Jay,
You'll love the TA's. They really stick and are extremely stiff so you don't
want to go overboard on the camber. The numbers I gave you should be fine and
streetable also.
To keep you're turbo alive you need to do the rod bearings ASAP unless you
are sure of the cars' history. For example if it always used synthetic oil
and it always was changed at every 5000 miles and didn't spend allot of time
on the track and it never got low then I would say perhaps take a chance. If
not then get the bearings done. I know it's a major hit but trashing an
engine is allot worse and peace of mind is importatant when you are in a
situation the demands concentration.
To keep it alive after that I offer these suggestions,
1. Use synthetic oil
2. change it before every track event and every 5000 miles if no events.
3. ALWAYS keep it 1/2 quart high. (check after every run group)
4. If the temp gauge ever gets into the high range shut it down and find out
what is wrong.
5. Use 93 octane gas always.
6. Don't put a chip in it. You WILL blow a head gasket, thereby getting water

The book covers both the 928 and the 924/944.  It is sold anywhere they sell

Bob,

Thanks for the info on meters' impedance.
I read a post today from Lee Atkinson with great interest : it seems
that at best power the mixture should be rich, and this is all I care about.

So I think a Digital meter on the 0-2 sensor will be up near
1V when it is rich enough for best power 13-14. So I may be better
off with something like the Edelbrock meter which is calibrateed from
12 and up. It must be sensitive to small changes around 1V.

I'm glad to hear you had success in cleaning out you MFI pump
yourself. I'm afraid mine needs more than cleaning, as it's calibration
was screwed up by Hans at H & R. Next month I will have time to
send it out and get it checked.

Subject: Big tires on early 911

Dave--

I hadn't responded to this thread until now, but my experience might be
useful.  My '72 came to me with 7x15 wheels and with 205-60s on the
front and 215-60s on the back.  It also came to me with blisters on the
two rear fenders where the back tires had rubbed.  It didn't seem to
happen often, though, so I drove carefully until I replaced the tires
with 205-60s all around.  I've been in this configuration for 5 years
now.  I occasionally hear a quick rubbing noise on bumps, but I haven't
had any further problem with blisters.

I have a suspicion that my ride height is less than standard, and that
if the car was raised a tiny bit I'd have no problem at all.  But I like
the way it looks at the current height :-)

Another data point for you to consider...

OK I've got a new thread for you guys.  I noticed something a few years back
when I put a duck tail on our '72 911 -- it seemed to run cooler.  I was
reminded of this when we got the '84 recently, it has a Carrera tail and
seems to run cooler than our other '84 that didn't have one.  Being the
shadetree en-gun-neer that I am, I was wondering if anyone that truly
understands the aerodynamics or other forces at work could explain this.

The way I figure:  A tail causes either less lift or maybe even downforce at
speed, right?  If there is lift at the back of the car (now I'm thinking in
terms of a slight vacuum), then the cooling fan is less efficient at pulling
air in and pushing it over the cylinders and engine oil cooler.  If you
decrease the lift the fan moves more air at any given rpm, thus a cooler
running motor.  If the wing is large enough to actually create downforce,
well all the better...

OK, I'm ready for this one to be swiss-cheesed by all you rapid firing
"real" en-gun-neers...

Subject: Theory of Dark

The recent discussion of light bulb theory caused me to resurrect the
following from a newsletter I used to edit; it's a bit off topic, but it
should settle the issue once and for all... :-)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

DARKNESS, BE GONE

For years it has been believed that electric bulbs emitted a substance
or energy called light.  Recent information, however, has proven
otherwise.  Electric bulbs don't emit light - they suck dark.  We
should thus call these bulbs dark suckers.  In addition to proving this
fact, the Dark Sucker Theory also presents a number of other basic
theorems concerning the properties of dark.  For example, the speed of
dark is greater than that of light, and dark has greater mass than
light.

The basis of the Dark Sucker Theory is that electric bulbs suck dark.
Take for example the dark suckers in the room where you are.  There is
less dark right next to them than there is elsewhere.  The larger the
dark suckers, the greater their capacity to suck dark.  Dark suckers in
a parking lot have much greater capacity than the ones in this room.
As with all things, dark suckers don't last forever.  Once they are
full of dark, they can no longer suck.  This is proven by the black
spot on a full dark sucker.  

A candle is a primitive dark sucker.  A new candle has a white wick.
You will notice that after the first use, the wick turns black,
representing the dark which has been sucked into it.  If you hold a
pencil next to the wick on an operating candle, the tip will turn
black, because it got in the way of the dark flowing into the candle.

There are also portable dark suckers.  The bulbs in these units can't
handle all of the dark by themselves, and must be aided by a dark
storage unit.  When the dark storage unit is full, it must be either
emptied or replaced before the portable dark sucker can operate again.
If you break open one of these filled canisters, one will see that
there is indeed a great quantity of stored dark on the inside.  

Dark has mass.  When dark goes into a dark sucker, friction from this
mass passing through another mass will generate a certain amount of
heat.  It is commonly known that an operating dark sucker generates
heat.  The dark suckers with the greatest capacities force the dark to
travel through the impeding media at greater rates of speed, so they
develop greater amounts of heat.  Thus, it is not wise to touch a
operating dark sucker.

Candles present a special problem.  Though the light does not have to
travel through a solid substance like the glass forming an electric
bulb, the dark must travel into the solid wick, instead of a void as is
found inside of the bulb.  As we all know, this process generates a
great amount of heat.  In fact, flammable items which come into contact
with an operating candle will be set on fire because of the amount of
heat generated.  Thus, it can be even more dangerous to touch a
operating candle.

Further proof of dark's mass is illustrated by the smoke generated by
inefficient or extinguished candles.  The intermediate state of dark
during its destruction is a visible soot or smoke.  Once again, casual
observers will attempt to refute the mass of darkness by noting that
smoke generally rises.  The same physical laws which allow clouds to
float, when water is heavier than air, cause smoke to rise.  In an
uncleaned area, it is easy to note the `rain' of soot which accumulates
on surfaces.

Though many are not aware of the incredible technology behind candles,
they illustrate another one of the many characteristics of dark.
Consider the fact that dark suckers absorb and store light.  At first
glance it may seem that this fact is a childish myth, since an
operating candle eventually diminishes to nothing.  Proponents of this
argument fail to realize that the candle is actually destroying the
dark which it sucks!  You may wonder why a room full of dark does not
become empty of dark after a while.  The answer is simple; dark is
capable of regenerating itself.  It is important to note that the speed
of regeneration is proportional to the volume of dark already present.
For example, in a closet where the volume is small, the candle will be
able to suck dark faster than the dark reproduces itself.  In a huge
cavern, however, a candle will not be able to keep up, thus we need
dark suckers with greater capacities when we use them in large spaces.

Further support for the destruction of dark is illustrated by the
previous reference to dark storage units.  Though most inexpensive
storage units will get full, and therefore become useless, the higher
priced ones can be attached to a charger which empties the canister by
destroying the dark inside.  The canister is then able to be used
again.

Dark is also heavier than light.  If you swim just below the surface of
a lake, you will see a lot of light.  As you swim deeper and deeper,
you notice it gets slowly darker and darker.  When you reach a depth of
approximately fifty feet, you are in total darkness.  This is because
the heavier dark sinks to the bottom of the lake and the lighter light
floats to the top.  This immense power of dark can be utilized to man's
advantage.  We can collect the dark that has settled to the bottom of
lakes and push it through turbines, which generate electricity and help
push dark to the oceans, where it can be safely stored.  Prior to
turbines, it was much more difficult to get dark from the rivers and
lakes to the oceans.  The Indians recognized this problem and tried to
solve it.  When on a river in a canoe, traveling the same direction as
the flow of dark, they paddled slowly, so as not to stop the flow of
dark; but when they traveled against the dark, they paddled quickly, so
as to help push the dark along its way.

Finally, we can show that dark is faster than light.  If you were to
stand in an illuminated room in front of a closed dark closet, and then
slowly open the closed door, you would see the light slowly enter the
closet; but since the dark is so fast you are not be able to see the
dark leave the closet.

In conclusion, dark suckers make all our lives much easier.  The next
time you look at an electric bulb, remember that it is a indeed a dark
sucker.

subsequent nighttime vision, he replied "must be light sunglasses, I

Plus his search for repro fiberglass 959 parts for his '77...

It seems to pretty common practice for Discount Tire stores in our area to
match Tire Rack's price without any dickering whatsoever.  An even better
trick is to take their own ad from R&T or some such and get them to match
*that* price.  From what I've compared, the Discount Tire Direct mail order
is cheaper than Tire Rack and you also can get them to lower their shipping
prices while "price comparing"...  Since we do a whole lot of tires during
the season, I made a point of getting to know the manager of *ONE* Discount
Tire store -- he mounts and balances all of our race tires for free and
steeply discounts any of the street tire services we need.  Another
advantage is all the free rotations, etc. when I don't have time to do it
myself (they have even done the trailer's tires ;-))...

I understand from this (and other rumors too...) that synthetics have a

Subject: Subject: T*d for Newbies


Hi, gang,

    A recent thread wondered about T*d.  Frankly, I am also a newcomer (~6 
weeks).  I have also wondered about The Listmeister's mysterious warnings
in the monthly rules about a certain, unnamed individual, and about the
frequent references to T*d.  So I took a crash course in Ted.  I will
*briefly* summarize.  

"Warning: the following may be tiresome for oldtimers!"

      I simply chose two months at random from the archives, Jan. 94 and June
94.  I loaded into my word processor and searched for "Ted."  I realize that 
this distills the *worst* of the p-philes.  However, I also got to read some
nice letters from Ted Rodgers this way <g>.

Jan. 94:  Ted M. appears to be a relative newcomer, but slightly outspoken.
  His mail generally centers around the condition of his tired 2.7L engine.
  Interactions with the list are slightly argumentative about why a rebuild
  is warranted.  Calls Bruce Andersen on the phone for second opinion. He 
  appears to be a bit annoying, but earnest.

Fast forward to June 94:  Ted sends constant discourses on why the Ultimate
  Porsche is a 3L SC engine in a pre-SC body.  Why?  The Almighty Weight 
  Difference.  This "definitely" makes it a Carrera-killer.  When asked to
  back this up with track experience, Ted cites street racing (which he calls
  "track racing.")  Boastfully challenges others to street showdowns.  Also, 
  as noted yesterday, he offers opinions on *everything*.  One example:  
  Someone wants to know what to look for when shopping for a '85 Carrera, 
  Ted answers "Carrera tensioners and pop-off valve."  Uh-huh.

    Sociological observation:  Ted is target and participant of open flame-war
  unlike anything found here.  Looked like something from rec.autos.driving.
  It reminded me of "The Lord of the Flies," as hostilities and infighting 
  threatened a meltdown of accepted social mores.

  'Nuff said.  Thanks for weathering the storm, guys and gals.  My crash 
course has made me appreciate this forum all the more.  Made me realize
why I hate Usenet groups.  Thanks,  Oh Listmeister, for what you have 
gone through to make this a place that people WANT to tune in to.

The '74 "Euro" Carrera used a mechanical fuel injected 2.7 L engine just
like the '73 RS (which is a 2.4S engine with bigger pistons and cylinders).
They were not sold new in the US, they were not certified by Porsche.
The USA got the '74 Carrera with CIS injection with about 30 HP less.
A few Euro's were imported in the 80's with the grey market boom. A friend
of mine from school, who's father was the president of the NYC area PCA (?)
had one at Rensselaer. They were available for about $15,000 in the early
80s in Europe. His was the day-glo green which was popular at the time.
I've seen another for sale in this area pretty reasonably. They are
definitely
cheaper than a '73 RS.

I think the '74 "RS" Carrera used a 3-litre engine, and are MUCH more
expensive and rare. There was a mint one in a recent Pano article
I think. These were the basis for the Penske IROC cars.

>BTW, I've seen the ads for RSs that are perpetually in the back of Pano.

These people are living in the past or have too much money invested in the
cars. They were going for $100,000 in the boom years, when they went from
$40,000 to double that in about a year. Too many speculators...

Yeah, Automotion carries it (I found it in my catalog last night).
The book says it covers 928, 924/944 through 1981;  I've got an 86S.
How much of the Chilton book is relevant to 86S's (or in your case
84S's).  Automotion also has quick reference guides available for 928's
(I think they're put out by the factory) that cover my car so I'm

Subject: 914 lube points? (long - sorry)

    Hi there,

as regular readers of this group ay be aware, I got a screaming deal a
while back on a nice but wrecked 914 that had been sitting a while (i.e.
I could afford it ;) )
    Anyway, as it has been sitting a (unspecified) while, I consider all
fluids in this car to be suspect and ready for a changing.  I already
have changed the oil and put in a happy Mahle oil filter, my next
projects next time I go home are to repack the front bearings (thanks
for the help on picking a grease - I think I may go with redline because
Summit Racing sells it and I can get stuff from there in 2 days) and to
change the tranny oil.
    Any recommends on a tranny oil?
    Also, where else on this car should be lubed, and what would you
recommend? (If other than the standard lithium grease.)  Any zerk
fittings, or are all loints/bushings/etc. "permanently" lubed?
    My Haynes manual only shows engine oil, tranny/diff, front hubs, CV
joints (can I do this myself?), and air cleaner (oil bath!).  anything
else?  Also, anyone willing to photocopy a '71 owner's manual for me? 
Mine's trash, and $50+ is just out of the question.
    Yes, I know I should check this out myself, but I'm trying to
collect as much info. as I can while I'm here at school so when I go
home I can get the most work done in the least amount of time.

    Slightly unrelated question:  My exhaust leaks.  I have SS heat
exchangers, so I am assuming I need new gaskets (which I already
purchased from Auto. Atlanta.)  i'm scared to unbolt the heat exchangers
from the head, though.  What am I likely to find?  Pulled/broken stud? 
Erosion around the old gasket?  What to do in either case?  Would it be
OK to epoxy in any pits if I do find erosion?  What epoxy would
withstand exhaust temp.'s?
    Some wanker installed a 916 rear end and a Monza exhaust on my car,
which are NOT compatible (the tips hit the bottom of the valence.)  So
instead of cutting the valence, he just pushed the exhaust system down
so the muffler brace actually is jammed below the studs on the tranny
it's supposed to be bolted to.  That's why I think it's a misaligned
gasket near the head. (thank god, only one side!) and hopefully not a
broken stud.  Needless to say, if I elect to keep the 916 rear
(dependent on whether or not I find a cheap rubber thingy for the top of
my rear bumper - fat chance) I WILL cut notches in the bottom.
    Also, the rear flange of my heat exchangers appears to be NOT SS.
(why?)  How do I keep those gaskets from getting trashed again?  Or will
driving the car keep huge chunks of rust from building up again? (right
now, the gasket is about useless, as big wide chunks of rust have forced
the mufflers away from the heat exchangers.

    Finally, apparenly one of my pretty alloy wheels (Pedrinni) appears
to have been mildly curb surfed.  About 1" of the rim is bent
ever-so-slightly.  Obviously, when I get new tires, this will become my
spare.  Question:  should I try to hammer it back, or is it just not
worth it?  Also, if anyone has either one Pedrinni or two steelies
laying around that they'll let go cheap, I could use them (alloy for
obvious reasons, steelies because I already have two and might want to
play snow-rally-driver someday - hey, I live in PA!)  Do VW hubcaps fit
on the steelies?  I don't rally care too much about appearance, but no
caps just look BAD. My Haynes manual shows a pic. of a 914 with what
look like regular bug 'caps.
    How do I get corrosion off my alloys?  The outsides look OK, but the
insides are just heinous.  This is the first car I have ever owned with
alloys, so I've never had to take care of them before.

Thanks much (and sorry so long!)

Nate,

who still loves his primer-colored, dented, leaky, and STILL FUN 914.

          sick of it, people donate just to get back to watching "This
          Old House" on time.  So if all donators post messages to
          p-philes, perhaps we will bore the non-donators to death and
          THEY will donate!  ;^)

          Actually, I think this all is pretty neat.  Stan has already
          personally saved me over $50 and I haven't even started the
          rebuild yet!  So Fred, you can up my pledge to $50  (I'd do
          more but right now I am still trying to scrape up enough $$$
          to get the Mahle Euro 2.0 pistons!)

          I have always wanted to sponsor a race car.  Someone should
          make a really small sticker with the p-phile names on it and
          give it to Stan with the donation.  That way everyone can
          have their name on a winner.  And you know how at Indy or
          other big name races the winning driver starts every
          sentence with "Well Bob, the Penzoil, Die-Hard, Hardees,
          Black-Flag, Schlitz Ford put in a good performance...." ? 
          Well, when Stan wins his first race, I want to be there when
          he says "I think the Fred Pach, Peter Albrect, Tim Radsick,
          Vol, ..........., (name n, where n=500) Porsche 914 really

I don't intend to  express any lack of gratitude for Stans time and energy 
on this list, nor do I intend to detract from the present efforts to help 
him out of a jam.  However I would like a little more information about his 
sudden need for cash before I pony up my hard earned dollars to the cause.  
(BTW, $15.00 may actually be a significant amount to some readers other than 
myself, we are in unique financial times)

When at first it was simply a "for sale" ad, I certainly would think it 
impolite to inquire as to the cause of his cash flow crisis, but since it is 
now more of a donation to a cause quest I feel that some explanation is in 
order.  If Stan still feels the explanation is too private for the list then 
I can respect his wishes.

Please take no criticism in this posting.  If I have missed an important 
explanation due to a mail snafu, please accept my apologies for this request.

I'm sure that the 900 thing is as much a marketing decision as anything.
Back in the "good old days" you could have odd numbers like 356, and
those few aficionados who cared didn't have to be sold on the cars.
Now everything is affected by the marketplace and advertising
considerations.  Given the rate at which the factory went through
numbers, for instance from 356 to 901 in about 15 years, by now they
should be up over 2000.  They probably are up in that range in some
internal accounting, since the model numbers we hear about shifted from
"pure" to "market-driven" sometime in the last 30 years.

When you pull on the electric release (with the door open, of course) 
do you get any activity from the hatch release motor at all?  If the 
motor works, it could be a misalignment between the motor and the 
latch on the hatch.  If the motor doesn't run, it could be because the 
interior lites are not coming on when you open the door or your motor 
could be dead.  The motor is similar to the one that runs the rear wiper 
arm ... that one stopped on me, so I took it apart (after checking that 
there was voltage on the connector) and cleaned the brushes and 
armature.  It works great again and cost me nothing but time(!).

The deal you got on rotors from Vertex is super ... I just put all four 
rotors on a few months back and I thought I had the best deal going, 
but you've found a better one.

>>Does your lock release turn contiguously or just one revolution?


It should turn only one revolution.  If you take the motor apart, you
may find a Rube Goldberg mechanical device that will stop the motor
once it has completed a single revolution.  Something may be 
broken or just dirty.

If your motor doesn't work properly anyway, you probably have little
or nothing to lose by taking it apart.

If you do, make sure you work where you can find small parts that
jump out when you open things up!

>> Used parts are something I have to see first before I drop my $ down

I would hesitate to buy electric or hydraulic parts used, but... you can
really save big bucks on mechanical or cosmetic stuff.  For example,
I rebuilt my Hirschmann power antenna from my original, a new mast
from Hirschmann, and a used antenna box from 928 International (needed
the circuit board).  I spent less than I would have to buy a new one and
it works great.

Also bought the air filter housing (lower half) used and a few other things.

Subject: The T*d.

 
Ben left out some great T*d D*tails.
 
The lockout incident -- he called a locksmith. Locksmith finally got a tool
down inside the door to unlock it, but scratched glass in the process.
Windshield as I recall. T*d wanted to sue him for it. It was this incident
that made me suspect that T*d was a counterfeit personality, because this is
the stuff of an old Urban Legend -- locksmith unlocks door, owner complains
about price or scratches or something, locksmith takes keys out of owner's
hand, throws them back in car, locks door, drives away. Classic.
 
Curb (or do you say Kerb) Surfing -- he bent some alloy wheels in the process.
Claims that he knows a shop that will unbend them, good as new. He tried to
foist these wheels off on P'philes for months, it seemed. If I remember, he
also had an air leak from one wheel, but didn't connect the dots inside his
brain...
 
Claims steel wheels are dangerous, ignoring the fact that most cars ever made
rolled on steel wheels. Says forged aluminum wheels fracture, cast wheels bend
nicely and safely. He should know.
 
Japanese shocks (KYB) are better because the Japanese are much more careful
craftsmen than those feelthy Germans. We suspect that he has one of those
rare made-in-Japan 911s.
 
The four different tires for autocrossing -- I came up with the comment that
he had "an entire Franklin Mint Collection of Classic Performance Tires on
his car." I'm proud of that one, if I do say so.
 
Autocrossing -- his hot-sh*t 77 or whatever 911, with 3 liter and 4 different
performance tires and KYB shocks was beaten in T*d's first-ever slalom
outing by both members of a husband/wife team (also on P'philes) driving a
bone stock 1971? 911 T, the bottom of the Porsche performance hierarchy at
that time, also on their first outing, and not just beaten, but beaten like
a drum -- 5 seconds on a 50ish second course? T*d claimed that even if he
clobbered the cones after the finish and hence got a DNF, he had a faster
run.
 
When he started mail bombing all P'philes with his own list, and even
multiple copies thereof, and repeated requests over two days did not stop
the posts, I fixed the problem on my end by calling the legal
department at his place of employment and leaving a nastygram. The posts
to my account stopped immediately.
 
Things have been sort of boring since Stan threw The T*d off the list, but
it had to be done. Fortunately, yesterday I discovered that The Spirit of
T*d lives. I needed to do some small stuff at the local community college
body and fender class. There is a guy there replacing a rear fender on a 914
1.7. He asked me if it is possible to move the rear suspension inward about
an inch on each side. "Why would you want to do that?" So's I can put on
great big wide wheels and tires. "Why don't you do what the factory did?
Instead of moving in, move out. Put on the 916-type flares." Naah, I don't
like dat Look. "You realize that even if you can move the pickups inward, you
will have to do all sorts of other stuff, like shorten the halfshafts?" Yeah.
So what? "What engine are you going to use in all this?" Uhh, just the
reg'lar one that's in there now.
 
At that point I gave up. (This guy has never, ever finished any of his
projects.)

Bob,

Thanks for the info on meters' impedance.
I read a post today from Lee Atkinson with great interest : it seems
that at best power the mixture should be rich, and this is all I care about.

So I think a Digital meter on the 0-2 sensor will be up near
1V when it is rich enough for best power 13-14. So I may be better
off with something like the Edelbrock meter which is calibrateed from
12 and up. It must be sensitive to small changes around 1V.

I'm glad to hear you had success in cleaning out you MFI pump

was screwed up by Hans at H & R. Next month I will have time to
send it out and get it checked.

Dave--

I hadn't responded to this thread until now, but my experience might be
useful.  My '72 came to me with 7x15 wheels and with 205-60s on the
front and 215-60s on the back.  It also came to me with blisters on the
two rear fenders where the back tires had rubbed.  It didn't seem to
happen often, though, so I drove carefully until I replaced the tires
with 205-60s all around.  I've been in this configuration for 5 years
now.  I occasionally hear a quick rubbing noise on bumps, but I haven't
had any further problem with blisters.

I have a suspicion that my ride height is less than standard, and that
if the car was raised a tiny bit I'd have no problem at all.  But I like
the way it looks at the current height :-)

OK I've got a new thread for you guys.  I noticed something a few years back
when I put a duck tail on our '72 911 -- it seemed to run cooler.  I was
reminded of this when we got the '84 recently, it has a Carrera tail and
seems to run cooler than our other '84 that didn't have one.  Being the
shadetree en-gun-neer that I am, I was wondering if anyone that truly
understands the aerodynamics or other forces at work could explain this.

The way I figure:  A tail causes either less lift or maybe even downforce at
speed, right?  If there is lift at the back of the car (now I'm thinking in
terms of a slight vacuum), then the cooling fan is less efficient at pulling
air in and pushing it over the cylinders and engine oil cooler.  If you
decrease the lift the fan moves more air at any given rpm, thus a cooler
running motor.  If the wing is large enough to actually create downforce,
well all the better...

OK, I'm ready for this one to be swiss-cheesed by all you rapid firing
"real" en-gun-neers...

Subject: Theory of Dark

The recent discussion of light bulb theory caused me to resurrect the
following from a newsletter I used to edit; it's a bit off topic, but it
should settle the issue once and for all... :-)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

DARKNESS, BE GONE

For years it has been believed that electric bulbs emitted a substance
or energy called light.  Recent information, however, has proven
otherwise.  Electric bulbs don't emit light - they suck dark.  We
should thus call these bulbs dark suckers.  In addition to proving this
fact, the Dark Sucker Theory also presents a number of other basic
theorems concerning the properties of dark.  For example, the speed of
dark is greater than that of light, and dark has greater mass than
light.

The basis of the Dark Sucker Theory is that electric bulbs suck dark.
Take for example the dark suckers in the room where you are.  There is
less dark right next to them than there is elsewhere.  The larger the
dark suckers, the greater their capacity to suck dark.  Dark suckers in
a parking lot have much greater capacity than the ones in this room.
As with all things, dark suckers don't last forever.  Once they are
full of dark, they can no longer suck.  This is proven by the black
spot on a full dark sucker.  

A candle is a primitive dark sucker.  A new candle has a white wick.
You will notice that after the first use, the wick turns black,
representing the dark which has been sucked into it.  If you hold a
pencil next to the wick on an operating candle, the tip will turn
black, because it got in the way of the dark flowing into the candle.

There are also portable dark suckers.  The bulbs in these units can't
handle all of the dark by themselves, and must be aided by a dark
storage unit.  When the dark storage unit is full, it must be either
emptied or replaced before the portable dark sucker can operate again.
If you break open one of these filled canisters, one will see that
there is indeed a great quantity of stored dark on the inside.  

Dark has mass.  When dark goes into a dark sucker, friction from this
mass passing through another mass will generate a certain amount of
heat.  It is commonly known that an operating dark sucker generates
heat.  The dark suckers with the greatest capacities force the dark to
travel through the impeding media at greater rates of speed, so they
develop greater amounts of heat.  Thus, it is not wise to touch a
operating dark sucker.

Candles present a special problem.  Though the light does not have to
travel through a solid substance like the glass forming an electric
bulb, the dark must travel into the solid wick, instead of a void as is
found inside of the bulb.  As we all know, this process generates a
great amount of heat.  In fact, flammable items which come into contact
with an operating candle will be set on fire because of the amount of
heat generated.  Thus, it can be even more dangerous to touch a
operating candle.

Further proof of dark's mass is illustrated by the smoke generated by
inefficient or extinguished candles.  The intermediate state of dark
during its destruction is a visible soot or smoke.  Once again, casual
observers will attempt to refute the mass of darkness by noting that
smoke generally rises.  The same physical laws which allow clouds to
float, when water is heavier than air, cause smoke to rise.  In an
uncleaned area, it is easy to note the `rain' of soot which accumulates
on surfaces.

Though many are not aware of the incredible technology behind candles,
they illustrate another one of the many characteristics of dark.
Consider the fact that dark suckers absorb and store light.  At first
glance it may seem that this fact is a childish myth, since an
operating candle eventually diminishes to nothing.  Proponents of this
argument fail to realize that the candle is actually destroying the
dark which it sucks!  You may wonder why a room full of dark does not
become empty of dark after a while.  The answer is simple; dark is
capable of regenerating itself.  It is important to note that the speed
of regeneration is proportional to the volume of dark already present.
For example, in a closet where the volume is small, the candle will be
able to suck dark faster than the dark reproduces itself.  In a huge
cavern, however, a candle will not be able to keep up, thus we need
dark suckers with greater capacities when we use them in large spaces.

Further support for the destruction of dark is illustrated by the
previous reference to dark storage units.  Though most inexpensive
storage units will get full, and therefore become useless, the higher
priced ones can be attached to a charger which empties the canister by
destroying the dark inside.  The canister is then able to be used
again.

Dark is also heavier than light.  If you swim just below the surface of
a lake, you will see a lot of light.  As you swim deeper and deeper,
you notice it gets slowly darker and darker.  When you reach a depth of
approximately fifty feet, you are in total darkness.  This is because
the heavier dark sinks to the bottom of the lake and the lighter light
floats to the top.  This immense power of dark can be utilized to man's
advantage.  We can collect the dark that has settled to the bottom of
lakes and push it through turbines, which generate electricity and help
push dark to the oceans, where it can be safely stored.  Prior to
turbines, it was much more difficult to get dark from the rivers and
lakes to the oceans.  The Indians recognized this problem and tried to
solve it.  When on a river in a canoe, traveling the same direction as
the flow of dark, they paddled slowly, so as not to stop the flow of
dark; but when they traveled against the dark, they paddled quickly, so
as to help push the dark along its way.

Finally, we can show that dark is faster than light.  If you were to
stand in an illuminated room in front of a closed dark closet, and then
slowly open the closed door, you would see the light slowly enter the
closet; but since the dark is so fast you are not be able to see the
dark leave the closet.

In conclusion, dark suckers make all our lives much easier.  The next
time you look at an electric bulb, remember that it is a indeed a dark
sucker.

It seems to pretty common practice for Discount Tire stores in our area to
match Tire Rack's price without any dickering whatsoever.  An even better
trick is to take their own ad from R&T or some such and get them to match
*that* price.  From what I've compared, the Discount Tire Direct mail order
is cheaper than Tire Rack and you also can get them to lower their shipping
prices while "price comparing"...  Since we do a whole lot of tires during
the season, I made a point of getting to know the manager of *ONE* Discount
Tire store -- he mounts and balances all of our race tires for free and
steeply discounts any of the street tire services we need.  Another
advantage is all the free rotations, etc. when I don't have time to do it

On the Turbo model there are "lips" on the side of the shield that
are also bolted on.  Check to see if you shield has the same sort of
feature.

I understand from this (and other rumors too...) that synthetics have a
better wide-range performance than multi-grades  ie lower pour point and
better lubrication through the heat/pressure range.  Is this true...details ?

yes...we're ganging up on this one !

Subject: Subject: T*d for Newbies


Hi, gang,

    A recent thread wondered about T*d.  Frankly, I am also a newcomer (~6 
weeks).  I have also wondered about The Listmeister's mysterious warnings
in the monthly rules about a certain, unnamed individual, and about the
frequent references to T*d.  So I took a crash course in Ted.  I will
*briefly* summarize.  

"Warning: the following may be tiresome for oldtimers!"

      I simply chose two months at random from the archives, Jan. 94 and June
94.  I loaded into my word processor and searched for "Ted."  I realize that 
this distills the *worst* of the p-philes.  However, I also got to read some
nice letters from Ted Rodgers this way <g>.

Jan. 94:  Ted M. appears to be a relative newcomer, but slightly outspoken.
  His mail generally centers around the condition of his tired 2.7L engine.
  Interactions with the list are slightly argumentative about why a rebuild
  is warranted.  Calls Bruce Andersen on the phone for second opinion. He 
  appears to be a bit annoying, but earnest.

Fast forward to June 94:  Ted sends constant discourses on why the Ultimate
  Porsche is a 3L SC engine in a pre-SC body.  Why?  The Almighty Weight 
  Difference.  This "definitely" makes it a Carrera-killer.  When asked to
  back this up with track experience, Ted cites street racing (which he calls
  "track racing.")  Boastfully challenges others to street showdowns.  Also, 
  as noted yesterday, he offers opinions on *everything*.  One example:  
  Someone wants to know what to look for when shopping for a '85 Carrera, 
  Ted answers "Carrera tensioners and pop-off valve."  Uh-huh.

    Sociological observation:  Ted is target and participant of open flame-war
  unlike anything found here.  Looked like something from rec.autos.driving.
  It reminded me of "The Lord of the Flies," as hostilities and infighting 
  threatened a meltdown of accepted social mores.

  'Nuff said.  Thanks for weathering the storm, guys and gals.  My crash 
course has made me appreciate this forum all the more.  Made me realize
why I hate Usenet groups.  Thanks,  Oh Listmeister, for what you have 
gone through to make this a place that people WANT to tune in to.

The '74 "Euro" Carrera used a mechanical fuel injected 2.7 L engine just
like the '73 RS (which is a 2.4S engine with bigger pistons and cylinders).
They were not sold new in the US, they were not certified by Porsche.
The USA got the '74 Carrera with CIS injection with about 30 HP less.
A few Euro's were imported in the 80's with the grey market boom. A friend
of mine from school, who's father was the president of the NYC area PCA (?)
had one at Rensselaer. They were available for about $15,000 in the early
80s in Europe. His was the day-glo green which was popular at the time.
I've seen another for sale in this area pretty reasonably. They are
definitely
cheaper than a '73 RS.

I think the '74 "RS" Carrera used a 3-litre engine, and are MUCH more
expensive and rare. There was a mint one in a recent Pano article
I think. These were the basis for the Penske IROC cars.

>BTW, I've seen the ads for RSs that are perpetually in the back of Pano.
>They are obviously asking too much or they would have been sold by

These people are living in the past or have too much money invested in the
cars. They were going for $100,000 in the boom years, when they went from
$40,000 to double that in about a year. Too many speculators...

Yeah, Automotion carries it (I found it in my catalog last night).
The book says it covers 928, 924/944 through 1981;  I've got an 86S.
How much of the Chilton book is relevant to 86S's (or in your case
84S's).  Automotion also has quick reference guides available for 928's
(I think they're put out by the factory) that cover my car so I'm
thinking that the Chilton book (for general procedures) and the
reference guide (for torque specs etc.) together might be useful for
most simple repairs.  Any other opinions out there in net land?

Subject: 914 lube points? (long - sorry)

    Hi there,

as regular readers of this group ay be aware, I got a screaming deal a
while back on a nice but wrecked 914 that had been sitting a while (i.e.
I could afford it ;) )
    Anyway, as it has been sitting a (unspecified) while, I consider all
fluids in this car to be suspect and ready for a changing.  I already
have changed the oil and put in a happy Mahle oil filter, my next
projects next time I go home are to repack the front bearings (thanks
for the help on picking a grease - I think I may go with redline because
Summit Racing sells it and I can get stuff from there in 2 days) and to
change the tranny oil.
    Any recommends on a tranny oil?
    Also, where else on this car should be lubed, and what would you
recommend? (If other than the standard lithium grease.)  Any zerk
fittings, or are all loints/bushings/etc. "permanently" lubed?
    My Haynes manual only shows engine oil, tranny/diff, front hubs, CV
joints (can I do this myself?), and air cleaner (oil bath!).  anything
else?  Also, anyone willing to photocopy a '71 owner's manual for me? 
Mine's trash, and $50+ is just out of the question.
    Yes, I know I should check this out myself, but I'm trying to
collect as much info. as I can while I'm here at school so when I go
home I can get the most work done in the least amount of time.

    Slightly unrelated question:  My exhaust leaks.  I have SS heat
exchangers, so I am assuming I need new gaskets (which I already
purchased from Auto. Atlanta.)  i'm scared to unbolt the heat exchangers
from the head, though.  What am I likely to find?  Pulled/broken stud? 
Erosion around the old gasket?  What to do in either case?  Would it be
OK to epoxy in any pits if I do find erosion?  What epoxy would
withstand exhaust temp.'s?
    Some wanker installed a 916 rear end and a Monza exhaust on my car,
which are NOT compatible (the tips hit the bottom of the valence.)  So
instead of cutting the valence, he just pushed the exhaust system down
so the muffler brace actually is jammed below the studs on the tranny
it's supposed to be bolted to.  That's why I think it's a misaligned
gasket near the head. (thank god, only one side!) and hopefully not a
broken stud.  Needless to say, if I elect to keep the 916 rear
(dependent on whether or not I find a cheap rubber thingy for the top of
my rear bumper - fat chance) I WILL cut notches in the bottom.
    Also, the rear flange of my heat exchangers appears to be NOT SS.
(why?)  How do I keep those gaskets from getting trashed again?  Or will
driving the car keep huge chunks of rust from building up again? (right
now, the gasket is about useless, as big wide chunks of rust have forced
the mufflers away from the heat exchangers.

    Finally, apparenly one of my pretty alloy wheels (Pedrinni) appears
to have been mildly curb surfed.  About 1" of the rim is bent
ever-so-slightly.  Obviously, when I get new tires, this will become my
spare.  Question:  should I try to hammer it back, or is it just not
worth it?  Also, if anyone has either one Pedrinni or two steelies
laying around that they'll let go cheap, I could use them (alloy for
obvious reasons, steelies because I already have two and might want to
play snow-rally-driver someday - hey, I live in PA!)  Do VW hubcaps fit
on the steelies?  I don't rally care too much about appearance, but no
caps just look BAD. My Haynes manual shows a pic. of a 914 with what
look like regular bug 'caps.
    How do I get corrosion off my alloys?  The outsides look OK, but the
insides are just heinous.  This is the first car I have ever owned with
alloys, so I've never had to take care of them before.

Thanks much (and sorry so long!)

Nate,

who still loves his primer-colored, dented, leaky, and STILL FUN 914.

          I firmly believe that PBS tries to bore their viewers to
          death during their pledge drive just so that they get so
          sick of it, people donate just to get back to watching "This
          Old House" on time.  So if all donators post messages to
          p-philes, perhaps we will bore the non-donators to death and
          THEY will donate!  ;^)

          Actually, I think this all is pretty neat.  Stan has already
          personally saved me over $50 and I haven't even started the
          rebuild yet!  So Fred, you can up my pledge to $50  (I'd do
          more but right now I am still trying to scrape up enough $$$
          to get the Mahle Euro 2.0 pistons!)

          I have always wanted to sponsor a race car.  Someone should
          make a really small sticker with the p-phile names on it and
          give it to Stan with the donation.  That way everyone can
          have their name on a winner.  And you know how at Indy or
          other big name races the winning driver starts every
          sentence with "Well Bob, the Penzoil, Die-Hard, Hardees,
          Black-Flag, Schlitz Ford put in a good performance...." ? 
          Well, when Stan wins his first race, I want to be there when
          he says "I think the Fred Pach, Peter Albrect, Tim Radsick,
          Vol, ..........., (name n, where n=500) Porsche 914 really

I don't intend to  express any lack of gratitude for Stans time and energy 
on this list, nor do I intend to detract from the present efforts to help 
him out of a jam.  However I would like a little more information about his 
sudden need for cash before I pony up my hard earned dollars to the cause.  
(BTW, $15.00 may actually be a significant amount to some readers other than 
myself, we are in unique financial times)

When at first it was simply a "for sale" ad, I certainly would think it 
impolite to inquire as to the cause of his cash flow crisis, but since it is 
now more of a donation to a cause quest I feel that some explanation is in 
order.  If Stan still feels the explanation is too private for the list then 
I can respect his wishes.

Please take no criticism in this posting.  If I have missed an important 
explanation due to a mail snafu, please accept my apologies for this request.

I'm sure that the 900 thing is as much a marketing decision as anything.
Back in the "good old days" you could have odd numbers like 356, and
those few aficionados who cared didn't have to be sold on the cars.
Now everything is affected by the marketplace and advertising
considerations.  Given the rate at which the factory went through
numbers, for instance from 356 to 901 in about 15 years, by now they
should be up over 2000.  They probably are up in that range in some
internal accounting, since the model numbers we hear about shifted from
"pure" to "market-driven" sometime in the last 30 years.

This sounds great!  If you could dig up the phone number for me

I called them and found that they don't mail fliers out anymore.  
However, the guy I talked to said that he carries used parts as

>> remote hatch release have never worked 

When you pull on the electric release (with the door open, of course) 
do you get any activity from the hatch release motor at all?  If the 
motor works, it could be a misalignment between the motor and the 
latch on the hatch.  If the motor doesn't run, it could be because the 
interior lites are not coming on when you open the door or your motor 
could be dead.  The motor is similar to the one that runs the rear wiper 
arm ... that one stopped on me, so I took it apart (after checking that 
there was voltage on the connector) and cleaned the brushes and 
armature.  It works great again and cost me nothing but time(!).

The deal you got on rotors from Vertex is super ... I just put all four 
rotors on a few months back and I thought I had the best deal going, 
but you've found a better one.

>>Does your lock release turn contiguously or just one revolution?


It should turn only one revolution.  If you take the motor apart, you
may find a Rube Goldberg mechanical device that will stop the motor
once it has completed a single revolution.  Something may be 
broken or just dirty.

If your motor doesn't work properly anyway, you probably have little
or nothing to lose by taking it apart.

If you do, make sure you work where you can find small parts that
jump out when you open things up!

>> Used parts are something I have to see first before I drop my $ down

I would hesitate to buy electric or hydraulic parts used, but... you can
really save big bucks on mechanical or cosmetic stuff.  For example,
I rebuilt my Hirschmann power antenna from my original, a new mast
from Hirschmann, and a used antenna box from 928 International (needed
the circuit board).  I spent less than I would have to buy a new one and
it works great.

Also bought the air filter housing (lower half) used and a few other things.

Subject: The T*d.

 
Ben left out some great T*d D*tails.
 
The lockout incident -- he called a locksmith. Locksmith finally got a tool
down inside the door to unlock it, but scratched glass in the process.
Windshield as I recall. T*d wanted to sue him for it. It was this incident
that made me suspect that T*d was a counterfeit personality, because this is
the stuff of an old Urban Legend -- locksmith unlocks door, owner complains
about price or scratches or something, locksmith takes keys out of owner's
hand, throws them back in car, locks door, drives away. Classic.
 
Curb (or do you say Kerb) Surfing -- he bent some alloy wheels in the process.
Claims that he knows a shop that will unbend them, good as new. He tried to
foist these wheels off on P'philes for months, it seemed. If I remember, he
also had an air leak from one wheel, but didn't connect the dots inside his
brain...
 
Claims steel wheels are dangerous, ignoring the fact that most cars ever made
rolled on steel wheels. Says forged aluminum wheels fracture, cast wheels bend
nicely and safely. He should know.
 
Japanese shocks (KYB) are better because the Japanese are much more careful
craftsmen than those feelthy Germans. We suspect that he has one of those
rare made-in-Japan 911s.
 
The four different tires for autocrossing -- I came up with the comment that
he had "an entire Franklin Mint Collection of Classic Performance Tires on
his car." I'm proud of that one, if I do say so.
 
Autocrossing -- his hot-sh*t 77 or whatever 911, with 3 liter and 4 different
performance tires and KYB shocks was beaten in T*d's first-ever slalom
outing by both members of a husband/wife team (also on P'philes) driving a
bone stock 1971? 911 T, the bottom of the Porsche performance hierarchy at
that time, also on their first outing, and not just beaten, but beaten like
a drum -- 5 seconds on a 50ish second course? T*d claimed that even if he
clobbered the cones after the finish and hence got a DNF, he had a faster
run.
 
When he started mail bombing all P'philes with his own list, and even
multiple copies thereof, and repeated requests over two days did not stop
the posts, I fixed the problem on my end by calling the legal
department at his place of employment and leaving a nastygram. The posts
to my account stopped immediately.
 
Things have been sort of boring since Stan threw The T*d off the list, but
it had to be done. Fortunately, yesterday I discovered that The Spirit of
T*d lives. I needed to do some small stuff at the local community college
body and fender class. There is a guy there replacing a rear fender on a 914
1.7. He asked me if it is possible to move the rear suspension inward about
an inch on each side. "Why would you want to do that?" So's I can put on
great big wide wheels and tires. "Why don't you do what the factory did?
Instead of moving in, move out. Put on the 916-type flares." Naah, I don't
like dat Look. "You realize that even if you can move the pickups inward, you
will have to do all sorts of other stuff, like shorten the halfshafts?" Yeah.
So what? "What engine are you going to use in all this?" Uhh, just the
reg'lar one that's in there now.
 
At that point I gave up. (This guy has never, ever finished any of his
projects.)

OK, but what if the engine is supercharged? Seems like the only vacuum

Congrats Pete!

Being of the same familial composition, I've encountered some of this 

myself.  The problem is, with 3 young'ns someone still has to stay home
since there's only 2 full and 2 half seats in a 911.  Of course, my SO
would probably rejoice at the thought of hauling the kids off in the 

p-car in order to enjoy som peace and quiet, but I digress....
My solution is to use rides in the p-car as a form of reward for good
behavior...

Regarding what you asked about to begin with...
Yes, I do believe that all the mounting points for the seats are still
there underneath the storage bins.  Apparently, the bins are bolted into
the same points that the seats would use.  The only problem your going
to have is recovering from the blunt head trauma your wife will inflict
on you when she finds out how much it's going to cost to get all the
misc bits for seatbelts, seats, trim, and such.  There's a good chance
you'll be able to find what your looking for from a salvager like Aase
or some such where you could get a whole set.  


Good luck,

Dear Bob:

	CYCLE WORLD has bit on the Porsche motorcycle story in a big way, just in
time for MOTORRAD (Germany's most prestigious two-wheel publication) to run a
brief interview with a Porsche spokesperson. The latter said there is not now,
nor has there ever been, a Porsche motorcycle initiative.
	The Porsche hoax first emerged months ago in British MOTOR CYCLE NEWS,
citing Australian sources. The same sources, cited in the same publication, are
now touting a Harley-Davidson Grand Prix bike. It should be noted that Harley
has yet to fully sort out its VR-1000 racer in the Superbike class--and that is
a four-stroke machine having some application to street machines of the future.
A "GP" bike would be prohibitively expensive and, as a two-stroke exotic, make
little sense for future H-D production plans.

Subject: Re: 912 Problem


Harry,

        Maybe you should call it in to the Tappet Brothers!  Let's see - The 
MEASTRO's toupee disapeared during reassembly, and got jammed between the 
ring gear and the starter.

        OK, you've said it wasn't the engine.  "Ifn" it was the tranny, 
disengaging the clutch would allow the engine to turn, so it can't be that.  
So we're down to the clutch and flywheel.

        Now I have a Jeep story.  I like to Jeep in the dunes.  Many years 
ago I replaced the Jeep clutch pressure plate.  The new pressure plate was 
the three finger type (I did say this was long ago).  It came with 3 small 
wooden spacers under the three fingers such that during reassembly, the 
clutch disk could be moved around for alignment purposes.  Then you 
activated the clutch and the 3 little spacers would just fall into the 
bottom of the bell housing.

        Well, this worked fine until one day in the dunes.  The starter was 
jammed hard and wouldn't turn the engine.  Upon starter removal, one of the 
little wooden spacers was jammed between the starter gear and the ring gear. 
Appearantly the dune-cresting technique (you kind of have to have the front 
in the air on sharp crests to keep from getting high-centered) caused the 
spacers to fly around and one of them just happened to nestle into the 
starter Bendix cavity, and was jammed against the flywheel when next 
activated.  One of those one-in-a-million things. So I dug the wood spacer 
out with my Swiss army knife, slapped the starter back in, and was on my 
way.  I figgured the chance of that happening again was nil.

        Well, 2 more times over the next 3 years, always whilst in the 
dunes, the other 2 spacers found their ways into the same spot.  The second 
time I couldn't believe it.  The third time, I believed it!

        So my guess is that something (not necessarily you hair piece) 
became jammed in the area of the flywheel/ring gear/pressure plate.  
Guessing what would make good campfire conversation :)

If my memory of those days in Saigon is correct, it is that everybody rode those  
Honda 50 scooters (they called them motorcycles, hah!). The ones driving jeeps 
were American soldiers and were deemed to deserve to have their Jeeps ripped off 
because they don't own the Jeeps anyway. Actually, anything not nailed down and 
a few things that were nailed down got ripped off. Ah, war is hell, but poverty

>I am trying to fix my '73 914 2.0 auxiliary air regulator...

With all the talk about auxiliary air regulators going on this last month I
finally opened up my nonworking unit to see if I could fix it.  I found two
problems.  The valve was rusted stuck in the open position and the heater
had some kind of calcified (electrolytic?) growth surrounding part of the
heating wire.

The stuck valve was relatively was relatively easy to correct...drown it for
three days in Balkamp Penetrant.  Valve works fine now.

The other problem is a little trickier to solve.  I suspect the heating
element wasn't warming sufficiently (because of this built-up).  I'm
thinking about building a new heater for the regulator.  The books call for
about 30 ohms on this heater element.  Mine measures about 13 ohms (using a
cheap DMM so it may be correct or not); it's possible that this stuff is
shorting out the heating element.  A ceramic disk with a few feet if 30
gauge nichrome coiled onto the surface should do the job nicely.

It was pretty difficult getting the old cannister apart; I had to file the
folded edge to get it started.  I want something that I can periodically
disassemble for cleaning.  (Say once a year or so; it's pretty wet around
here). I've designed a housing that will fit within the available space and
worked up a preliminary design for a new heater.  Everything looks feasible
and I'm preparing to build a prototype, assuming I can find a source of
Nichrome wire.

Given the rather large sums used and NOS aux. air regulators command these
days, rebuilding mine seems a sensible approach.

Anybody have any thoughts about this?  See anything I'm missing?  BTDT?

I don't wish to appear critical, but I am not sure that I understand the

What will I do if I know there is metal in the oil, the only way to check

yeah.  the real idea is to track things over time.  a sudden spike in the

Guten tag,

I read an interesting response to an oil temperature question
recently posed in "European Car" magazine.  The person was 
asking if he should be trying to bring down an oil temp of 240
degrees.  They responded with, and I quote :

"Don't worry too much about the oil temperatures in the 240-
250 degree range, particularly if you use a good synthetic,
which we highly recommend.  Despite what you may have heard
or seen in print, VW is quite happy with an oil temp in this
range.  Anything less may make less horsepower, and will
certainly lower fuel mileage and increase emissions.  Too
cool is worse than too hot, particularly with a synthetic oil
that won't break down until 350-400 degrees."

I thought this was interesting.  Sorry for the bandwidth
wasting...

Hmmm.....  Stripped does not include the drivetrain so it's still considered
by most to be a REAL 911 ;^).  Now, I won't go as far to say that
the RS moniker is necessarily deserved, but the essence of the car is oriented
more towards driving than a loaded down luxo-boat.  To set the record straight,
the RS America looks more like a stripper than it is.  It still has power seats
and windows, alarm system, etc.  The options were: 5 paint colors, Limited
slip, sunroof, casette stereo, and A/C.  Standard equipment consists of fixed 

Carrera tail, cloth sport seats 17" turbo-style wheels, M030 sport 

suspension, and storage bins in place of the rear seats.  The remainder of 

the car is a C2.  Some, however, claim that early examples had some additional

Some suggested he didn't really exist--he was actually a

In fact he would reply to others in the most patronizing tone as though
someday they may understand how clueless they really were: "You're catching
on Sempai" etc.

He was not only clueless but he was utterly clueless in the most amazing way.
It was as though he somehow grew to semi-adulthood with the world
view and social perspective of a 10 year old (I'm being generous here).

He lived in his own parallel universe and would make an excellent subject
for some sociological study.

Let's give him credit for coining the phrase "Nazi Sheep".  This gave

PCNA advised dealers that Porsche AG " will restructure production facilities
commencing in October 1995 to prepare for the Boxster production.  As a
result, all factory tours will be suspended as of October 1, 1995.  The
regular tours will actually be discontinued as of July 15, with "restricted"
tours possible August 15 through September 30."

See your dealer for details, no definition given for "restricted" tours.

With regard to 1995 Tourist Delivery Group Tours (which they're calling
"Treffens" and which some of you may remember the PCA controversy on
continuation with certain travel agencies in the early
 80's), PCNA advised dealers on Feb 7, 1995 (paraphrased): Three Tourist
delivery events (April 27-28, June 29-30, Sept 28-29) for 1995.  Customer
makes own travel arrangements.  Two day event, day 1: Complete paper work &
informal dinner, day 2: Visit Museum, tour production facilities, lunch at
the Casino, visit Weissach R&D Center (rides in test cars), delivery of new
car, cocktail party and dinner.  Customers responsible for travel arangements
but special rate at Graf Zeppelin in Stuttgart.  Lunch, dinners, and local
travel sponsored by PCNA and Porsche AG.

Vehicles order for April tour must be received by PCNA NLT end of February.
 See your dealer for details, they are asked to coordinate with Cheryl Whitake
r at 702-348-3109.

As an aside, apparently no Boxsters will be available even for the Sep 28-29
delivery event.  Other "good" news above was transmitted along with
information on the 2 percent price increase (deliveries through March will
apparently be "price protected", but again contact your dealer if you have
one on order).

Subject: 914 2.0 FI vs Webers

I'm finally serious about getting my "project car." Saturday I'll look at a
1973 914 2.0 liter. The car has Webers, Konis front/Bilsteins rear, Yokos,
"Euro pistons", CD ignition, no rust, $3500. The current (2nd) owner
mentioned that the first owner did some (guess what) autocrossing with the car.

The stock FI has been replaced by Webers. I understand this was a common
occurrence, mostly because folks didn't understand the FI, and were more
familiar with good ole carbs.

I know very little about Webers. Will they require lots more fiddling to
keep running well? I'm somewhat spoiled because my current 911 has the Bosch
Motronic system.

I plan to use the car as a daily driver and possible autox weapon. (Yes,
I'll need to check the mods to see what's legal.)

I don't live in California, so the non-stock carbs are OK, FOR NOW. Does
anyone think the rest of the US will someday adopt the more restrictive
California standards? In other words will I someday have convert back to FI?
Yeah, good luck on finding the parts....

Well, all you had to do around here (earlier this week, anyways, when it was
below -30 Celsius *and* Fahrenheit) would be to place a litre of 5w30 dino
and a litre of 5w30 synthetic outside for an hour or so, and try to pour
them. You would see for yourself whether the rumour that synthetics have a
lower pour point is true or not :)

"Other potential advantages of these synthetic lubricants are their higher
thermal oxidation index and their higher inherent viscosity index."

>yes...we're ganging up on this one !

Well, *I*'m not going to argue with Mr. Anderson. You can ask him for
details if you want <grin>.

BTW, quick plug here for the Up-fixin books... if one works on one's
Porsche, they're *extremely* handy to have around, and well worth what PCA

IMHO, the real damage done by the  T*d Incident has been to the willingness
of the people on the list to share their views, however outrageous, for fear
of similar punitive action.  Now, everytime I access the postings, I get the
distinct image of a group of very intelligent and enthusiastic people holding
back for fear of a backlash from the Internet Police (InterPol?).

I still remember with great fondness the repartee occasioned by Miss Jeanie
(where are you when we need you most??!!).  Everyday, I looked forward to the
MissJeanie postings to see what literary gems would issue forth from the
list.  They were smart, intelligent, and funny as hell.

T*d deserved to be expelled from the list, but I fear he took our soul away
with him, and that is the real tragedy.

The secret to the lock release (on the 928) stopping at the right place
is a little fuse, a few inches up the wire from the release motor
itself. That fuse (not mentioned in the owner's manual) provides the
power that drives the motor back to the correct stopping point when
you release the switch. If it is blown, the motor will just stop
immediately, at whatever point in the cycle it happens to be, which
may mean that you can't get your hatch to stay shut because the motor
stopped with the latch in the release position. The fuse is a 1 amp
cylindrical glass fuse, that you can get at your local electronic
parts store.

Hey give me a break! Does the word "something like" have any meaning in your
vocabulary?! I usually don't have my purchase receipts with me all the time.
Do you? And BTW, does "exchange rate" and "world markets" meas anything to 
you also?

You should have bought the tool then, save the 10 bucks and send it to the

Subject: early 911 head flow-test


Hi all.

First one histroric rule.

IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO CHANGE VALVE SIZE!
So we test the heads only with standard size valves.

Something about the flow test we had made.

When you look the table and colums in it, specially
the HP column, please remember that the values are
meassured or calculated. So, the hp column has nothing
to do with real power got out from the engine.

The main idea is first flow-test the original head,
modify the head, flow test it and compare the
results. We was not quite happy to us 1st modification
so we will continue modificate the head and flow-test it.

With standard head, early 2 liter 911 engine gives 130 hp
with solex PI40 carps, so if we got 25 calculated hp more, I
suppose that ours engine now gives more power, but how much, I
don't know. In ours test we use same venturi (30) and it's not
anymore correct choice for modificated head.

Another thing you must remember when looking flow-test results.
It's quite sure for test, that what bigger the ports are that better
flow and hp you get. BUT, with large ports you lost power an torgue
in lower RPM range.

With large port size, you can get head that start works after 5000 RPM.
it's good if you have wery wild cam eg 906 or GE-80 cam and you
only race with that car but it's not good for street or rally.

All comments are welcome.

I'm sure T*d never used chain tensioners. He would argue that

having, in effect, variable cam timing due to chain compliance.

Hi, Lou,

The one inch spacer stays.

The 7+8x15 wheels were the sport suspension option on the early (83-85/1)
944 cars. (Mine came with them...) Also included was the rear 14 mm sway bar.

Subject: The Official Word on the "Save the 914 Foundation"

Dearest List Members,

This outpouring of attention has been overwhelming. I have had *NO* idea
how best to deal with this, so have put off saying anything until I knew
what it was that I wanted to say. Since we're rolling up on Fred's 2/11 
deadline, I figured it was time to speak up, even though I'm still speachless.

First, *THANK YOU*. Your care and attention has amazed me. From my perspective
I've just been sort of doing my thing here, and while many of you have become
personal friends, this incredible outpouring of concern and offers to help
is beyond anything I've ever experienced. I'm really and truly starting
to feel like Jimmy Stewart's character in "It's a Wonderful Life".  Regardless
of whatever else follows, I'm greatly enriched by knowing each and every
one of you. Thank you again.

Second, the 914 is sold. I will be delivering it today to Bart Denys
in scenic Thibodaux, LA. I held off doing this for a good while, thinking 
that well, I *could* let the group buy the car from me, and had to do a 
lot of soul-searching before coming to the conclusion: even if I kept the 
car, I would not have had the chance to race it this year. At all. It's 
just not in the cards. I can *ALWAYS* build another later but it's nearly 
criminal to let a car this well prepared *JUST SIT* and dry rot when it 
could be doing *SOMETHING*. Someone needs to be getting some enjoyment
from it, and it was just making me miserable sitting there, looking back
with those taped-over eyes asking to be taken for a romp at Hallett or
Cabaniss or TWS or Road America...

And I can always try to buy it back later...

Last, well, I don't know; *IS* it time to start a Porschephiles Defense
Fund to keep this thing operating?? I'm not likely to run out of desire to
do it, and I sort of have the Internet connection part "wired" so to speak,
(at least for now) but it's running on pretty tired 3 or 4 year old 
hardware that wasn't that fast to begin with... I refuse to be in a 
position to personally profit from a group fund raising effort, but if we
are having a bake sale, it might be time to get new hardware.

Anyway, I'll not be reading mail from about 11:30 AM CST today until
about 8:00 PM CST Saturday.  You all have good weekends, take your cars
and commune with the open road or the closed circuit or whereever you find
your peace.

is renewing the oil cooler. For that matter the oil tank.
 The reason for the rebuild is a broken wrist pin on #1. After I removed
the screen (while motor still in car) I was able to pull handfulls of
metal out of the case. 
 Viewing the oil flow diagram I can see most of the BIG stuff should have
been caught by the screen and the smaller stuff caught by the oil filter.
But I don't wana be doin this agains for quite a while. From somewhere I
heard that the oil tank was copper lined. Can a normal shop clean these
items? Any precautions I need to be aware of?

Subject: tensioning 944 belts

Richard;
You can buy a tool if you have your heart set on 
blowing $500, but I (and many others) don't think
you need to.  I have an 84 944 and when I did my
belts I was faced w/ the same problem.  I did a lot
of research, and many "shops" (not P dealers) that
do 928/944 work don't even own the tool.  They use
the accepted belt tensioning wisdom that they use
on BMW, Mercedes, Ford, Toyota etc.  That's what I did
and I have 25k  miles on my belts now.  And I don't
drive like an old lady either!

FIRST
Make sure you got them on right.
Then make double sure you got them on right.

1) Twist the longest span of the belt w/ your fingers.
Shoot for tension that allows you to turn the belt
about 1/4 turn.  
(my belts seemed slightly less than 1/4 when all done)

2) Leave the covers off, and start it up.
If the belt screams at you - it's too tight.

3) Leave the balancer shaft belt on the loose side
while you get the Cam belt right.  Then do the Balancer
belt.

4) Use common sense.

5) Recheck the belts in a couple thousand, because they seem
to give a little when you first install them.


USE CAUTION - this topic is flame bait.

After you break any metal parts in the inside of the engine, you
need to do a few things differently than you might for a "normal"
rebuild 

* Always have the oil cooler, lines, and tank cleaned very , very
  well. There is residual cruft in there that can make your new
  engine not be very new in short order.

* For the lines and cooler, the procedure I use is pressure flushing
  with denatured alcohol. Then, of course, pressure testing the
  cooler, and often the lines if they're not pretty new.

* For the tank, that varies. I've been known to just send the tank to
  the radiator shop and have it "tanked" like I do with gas tank,
  then seal it with Wurth gas tank sealer. I've also been known to
  powder coat them if I had a box of other crap getting powder
  coated and it was easy to just toss it on the pile. I'd *NEVER*
  pay extra to get one coated as a special, but if it's just another
  part in the pile, well, why not?

was kind of dim. I really didn't have the ability to investigate at 
the time(I will this weekend)of the cause. Has anyone experienced the same
problem. I think this is a pre existing problem. (pre halogen bulbs.) 
Thought I'd ask for some insight before I pull it apart.
TIA

I disagree.  I think this topic has been discussed too much as it is.

Subject: T*d Went a-Racin'

        Gee, all of this T*d-nostalgia makes me remember...
        PCA Zone 7 Autocross in the Oakland Coliseum parking lot.
I get there about 11AM, since my group wasn't running or working
in the morning.  As I drive 'round the outside of the lot to get
to the grid area, I see a dog-doo brown 911 going around on the
course.  Accelerating hard, evidently--the nose is *way* up in
the air!  Then I notice that the driver is *braking*--when the
car accelerates, the nose goes up even higher!  I thought it was
going to flip!
        Sure enough, it was T*d.  We thought that his "competition
alignment" was pretty interesting.
        He was out there again the next day.  Heck, he was the
flagman for part of the day!  (Eeek!)  No pile-ups, though.  On
one particularly memorable run, T*d sets up way off line for the
second of a series of "gates".  Sure enough, he spins right at the
gate.  Gets the car around again, off he goes for the next gate,
SKREEEK!  Another spin.  Several of us on the sidelines are looking
on with smiles on our faces, probably remembering a time or two
that we did something like that...  And what the heck, it was just
a practice lap, right?  Then he comes around on his timed lap--
sets up in the exact same place for the gate, same result--around
he goes!  Gets the car moving again, and guess what?  Spins yet
again at the exact same place!  This elicited some laughter from
the crowd.
        On his next run, the announcer said, "Wing Commander T*d
Matsumura has already given us a demonstration of his loop-the-loop,
now he's going to try wing-walking!"  By that time, we were rolling
on the ground, howling with laughter.  Thus was born the Wing Com-
mander title.
        And remember, all this was after about three months of con-
stant flame-wars about how much better T*d's car was and how much
better T*d's driving was than anyone else!
        Aaah--the memories...

Subject: Re: 914 2.0 FI vs Webers

I'm finally serious about getting my "project car." Saturday I'll look at a
1973 914 2.0 liter. The car has Webers, Konis front/Bilsteins rear, Yokos,
"Euro pistons", CD ignition, no rust, $3500. The current (2nd) owner
mentioned that the first owner did some (guess what) autocrossing with the car.

The stock FI has been replaced by Webers. I understand this was a common
occurrence, mostly because folks didn't understand the FI, and were more
familiar with good ole carbs.

I know very little about Webers. Will they require lots more fiddling to
keep running well? I'm somewhat spoiled because my current 911 has the Bosch
Motronic system.

I plan to use the car as a daily driver and possible autox weapon. (Yes,
I'll need to check the mods to see what's legal.)

I don't live in California, so the non-stock carbs are OK, FOR NOW. Does
anyone think the rest of the US will someday adopt the more restrictive
California standards? In other words will I someday have convert back to FI?
Yeah, good luck on finding the parts....

I think that all states will require some sort of annual or bi-annual smog
inspections, so it is in your interest to at least have the equipment to 
return the car to its F.I. condition.  If the engine does not have a cam too
wild for the F.I. (too much duration!). then the Webers are probably a waste
and only good for sex appeal.  The F.I. is much better suited to every day
driving, good mid range, and as much top end as the engine can use in a semi-
stock state of tune.  If the engine has a cam with more duration than the F.I.
can tolerate, then you might see overall performance improve, but probably only
realized if you auto-cross.  The fuel economy of the F.I. will not be matched
by that of the Webers either.  The Webers do require tuning, something not 
needed the F.I.. The F.I is generally more reliable, the only problems I have
had in 20+ years of 914 ownership, is the wiring and connections.  I have never
had a F.I. component failure, save for one injector that started sticking afer
10+ years.

Hi all,

I made my pledge to the fund, Stan has sold the car. Here's what I think.
I agree that participating in P-files is great. Since there was a 
suggestion that perhaps the heart of our organization could use some 
renewing, I will commit to supporting that option. 

We are a Porsche Club Region in the Internet Era. I think we could help
improve our facility and communication by renewing the server. 

If P-files involved a periodic subscription fee, I would support that.
I don't expect something for nothing. While I can access the entire group,
it is the facility at tta.com that does the work. 

My vote is to re-direct the effort into improving our facility, if Stan
is receptive.

Howdy,

My wife trashed my Grand Cherokee V-8 so I am in need of at

can live with. I can get a used stock wheel for about $150.

On the other hand, I can get a set of wheels bigger than the
stock 15x7, and some bigger tires. I'm thinking about 15x8
and 255/60/15 tires. I tried Tony Platano's
16" corvette wheels and tires with adaptors and they looked
great, but the adaptors are poor quality and the ride would be
too stiff I think.

I have found American Racing Equipment wheels that would
fit and are reasonably priced, but am not confident that the
quality would hold up. Any experience with these wheels?

Does anyone have a recommendation for commuting and
towing purposes? Will 255/60/15 tires work just as well
on my stock 7" rims? I would like BFG VR4 tires, but they
don't seem to make them in that size.

I used the same technique to tension my cam belt. It was, however,

that doing it by hand is too imprecise.

This is also rather vague. The belts still whine somewhat even
when correctly tensioned.

The local dealer wants $120 to do a belt tension. The independent
mechanic charged half that. I figure it is cheap insurance. Of course,
some folks don't believe in insurance. YMMV.

If you want to drive your Porsche in the snow, my recommendation is to
acquire a separate set of snow tires and wheels.  In the latest Porsche
Panorama, a classified ad lists 4 steel wheels and 4 Pirelli Winter 190 Tires
for $350 for a set of 4.  Check Page 106 of the February 95 Panorama for the
ad (I won't post here, because if you ain't a PCA member, you're going to 
miss out.)

That having been said, the Bridgestone RE-71 and the Dunlop D40-M2 tires
have worked extremely well for me in both the dry and the wet, on the street
and at the track.

stick out way past the fenders, and an Oakley Factory Pilot sticker on the

Subject: Renewing oil cooler

Hi, Stan.
 
You mention hot tanking an oil cooler.
 
Just a word of caution to others on the list: don't do this with aluminum
coolers! (I can't remember where Porsche used aluminum coolers, but I think
they did on some models/some years/some applications). The caustic tank at
the radiator shop will dissolve the stuff.
 
I remember having a replacement cooler tanked at a very friendly shop nearby
 - Caps Radiator Shop on Beach Blvd, Huntington Beach, CA, for any locals;
these guys are really helpful and don't even charge an arm and a leg. I
practically had to beg them to take some money for the job. Anyway, the late
356 oil cooler is usually painted in metallic silver. They said that if it has
any aluminum, it would boil immediately when put in the tank. They put it in,
and what boiled was the silver paint, but they could tell immediately that
the amount of boiling was not consistent with aluminum parts so they went
ahead with it.

Subject: CA Smog ?s - SUMMARY




Here is a  summary of the responses I received from my esteemed colleagues on
 P-philes regarding the posting on CA smog rules. 
My original question was: Does the necessary-to-pass work HAVE to be done at a
 smog-certified mechanic?

	Most persons agreed that the work can be done
 as you wish (that is, you can do the work; your mechanic can do the work;
 you can opt for the smog station to do the work).
	The 'hitch' is:
		You only get ONE waiver per car.

	The workarounds presented:

	Register in a non-smog county (which?)

	Find 'someone' to give you a certificate (at no small cost, I'm afraid)

	Have mechanic dial-in Zeniths just before test (should pass - obvious)

	Go to a motorcycle junkyard; buy cheap non-running junker; register (no certificate required); use current tag on licence plate (no corresponding
 numbers on registration); keep car's registration up-to-date (just needing smog certificate) - illegal, but innovative and hard to trace.

I think the State's system really sucks (no pun intended). If the repairs amount to over the limit (currently $400 - soon to be $700), it seems that you're
 given a waiver. New legislation (proposed to go into effect 1/1/96 - not
 currently passed) states that there will be only one waiver allowed per
 vehicle. 

A quote from Sean Steinman puts it plainly, "All in all these guys (certified
  smog stations [sic]) are milking the state for funds. They only charge for the certificate and the state pays them for their work. SCAM."  - Amen brother.

I just stopped by my friendly neighborhood Porsche dealer for some parts, and
on the way out asked about the video.  The salesman pointed to a disply with
about 5 of the videos and said to take as many as I wanted.  I took one and the
 guy asked if I was sure that I didn't want another!  I said no, and went home
and watched it.  I wasn't all that.  I mean, all 90 seconds total you get to
see the 911 in action is cool, but the rest is fluff.  Although, the end really
 gets me- they flash the 911 coming at you (like a strobe) and you hear the eng
ine reving at about 7500 RPMs.  I could deal with a video just of that over and

Subject: 912E#1 has been TOTALLED! Details...

Greetings Porsche Dwellers,
	I was having an enjoyable commute to work when I passed the 
mechanics shop that I sold the 912E to when I see "my" car looking like 
it had been run over by a freight train!!!  On my way home I stopped to 
check out the story.  He had swapped in a spare 914 motor so he could 
drive it while shelving the original.  Its been foggy and nasty here for 
the past few days and he was driving down a city street.  He looked down 
to adjust the heat (BAD IDEA) and when he looked up the car in front of 
him had just rapidly changed lanes.  He suddenly became face to face with 
a parked UPS truck!  Luckily  the driver was out of the truck, but poor 
Greg (the mechanic) got a taste of Porsche's fat 3-spoke wheel.  He's OK, 
but the car is wrecked beyond belief.  The front part is totally smashed and 
it buckled in the middle so the doors are about five inches behind where 
they are supposed to be. (NASTY :^()
	Anyway, he had his dealer tag on it and his insurance will only 
give him $7600 for it!  He asked me to write here for suggestions.  What 
should he do with it?  He can pay $1500 for the remnant and try to 
rebuild it but it isn't worth it, is it?  What to do? Any suggestions 
would be appreciated.

Subject: Re: CA Smog ?s - SUMMARY

There used to be non-smog counties in California, but I think that's a
thing of the past.  Misery loves company, and though smog isn't a
problem on the coast, the bureaucrats want to treat everybody equally.

In Nevada, smog inspections are required in Clark and Washoe counties,
but not in any others (that means Reno yes, Carson City no).  They're 
annual, but pretty much tailpipe only, and no catalytic converter
required before '81.  Meanwhile, in the People's Republic of
California one can probably find individual solutions if needed, but
they would have to be kept private for the sake of all concerned.

These are consequences of whom we elect to public office--consequences
that are often learned after it's too late.

Subject: RE: Lame Headlights

Sean,

I had the same problem a while ago.  Turned out to be a broken ground 
connection at the dim light.  At first it made no sense that the light 
was dim.  You would expect the light to not work at all with a broken 
ground wire.  However, a current path still exists.  The current path is 
thru the dim light's low beam filament, to the common ground connection 
inside the headlight (which is not grounded anymore), thru the dim lights 
high beam filament, thru the car's wiring harness to the other 
headlight's high beam filament, then to the good ground of the other 
headlight.  Some current could flow, but not enough to make the light 
bright.

If your ground wire is OK, check the headlight with an ohmmeter.  The 
ground connection could be broken inside the headlight.

How come I'm not surprized that this happened?

His insurance company won't give him more than he had it 
insured for no matter what it's worth.

As to whether or not the remnant is worth $1,200 - I read a 
story a few years ago about a guy who races a priceless vintage 
Ferrari. He said "If I wreck it, it's no big deal as long as I 
have the plate with the VIN number on it. I can have another car
built from scratch around the plate for only $40,000 and the car 
is worth over a million"  The magic VIN number is where the value

My question is rather embarrassing (you'd think I'd know better after keeping

maintenance free types, and my gravity tester is probably 20 years old too.
 I can trickle charge till I'm blue in the face ,and have plenty of voltage,

If you want the best of both worlds, you'll want to pick up a set of snow tires (and 
probably wheels, if you want to keep the originals nice and salt-free - unless it's 
too late. :).
For snows, Nokias are probably the best - you can get Hakkapelliita (or however 
it's spelled!) 10s, which are pure snow tires, or... Shoot, can't remember the 
name, but they also make a high-performance snow tires. Both are 
uni-directional, the hi-po ones look most like the usual unidirection summer 
tires.

As for summers, I think everyone will give a different answer. I myself like the 
Comp T/A ZRs, the new ones - plus they're pretty inexpensive.

If you insist on an all-season, there are some newer high-perf ones that should 
be very good in both - BF Goodrich has been advertising the Comp T/A ZR4, an 
all-season ZR tires.

that he wouldn't consider new hardware, that served
all of us, to be in the category of personal profit.

Fred, why not just go through with what you started.
You said there were over 300 pledges.  Call 'em in,
and mail whatever it adds up to to Stan.  He can

Note that the RE-71's, anyways, are pretty much useless in cold weather.
According to local Bridgestone rep., the tread compound of the RE-71's is
designed to be grippy in the usual spring/summer/fall temperature range,
while not getting too soft when the going gets hot (e.g. on the track). The
trade-off is rubber that's as hard as concrete at colder temps, and not much
traction, either. I can vouch personally that the RE-71's snow performance
leaves a lot to be desired <cough>.

I have "high-performance" all-season Bridgstone RE-92's on my 924. The snow
performance is decent, the ride is smoother and has less tread noise than an
RE-71, and they handle nicely on the track. Unfortunately, if you go at
decent black run group track speeds, the tread squirm (and resulting
4-wheel-drifting) leads to not-nice-looking wear patterns and a bit of
chunking. They should be just about right for a daily driver, though, and
the H-rated version (which are fine for the street) have much higher wear
ratings than the V-rated version (which is what I have).

A better solution is, of course, like George mentioned, a second set of rims
and something like the 190's for the winter (I'd say Blizzaks, but they're
too radical a snow tire for most people). Then you could put RE-71's on your
regular rims for the summer, and get another set of rims to put track tires
on, and...

Subject: 911SC


I have a quick question about the 911SC that I hope someone can answer.  
While reading the Dean Batchelor "Illustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide" I 
noticed that in one section he says that in '81, the SC's compression was 
upped from 8.5:1 to 9.8. This was complimented with a supposed increase 
in HP from 180-204.  Is this accurate?  Why is this the only literature 
that I have read about this in?  If this is true, does the increased 
compression do anything to the life of the 'bulletproof' SC engine?  Is 
the increase in HP worth the effort looking for an '81,'2,'3 (assuming it 
is true)?  Thanks for the info.

Whoa;  No Flame here, Fred... but I think we read different messages.  He sold

Boys and girls,

We all owe Fred an enormous debt for getting this effort off the ground.
We've seen that Stan, sadly, has sold the 914, and his reasoning was sound.

Thanks Fred, for motivating us, however unsuccesful we were, to try to pay Stan 
back for *his* generosity!

We've all also seen that the list could use a transfusion of computerizing 
stuff.  Stan shouldn't have to bear any of that cost.  It's our list, and
we oughta cough up the nosh required to make it happen.

Fred got the ball rolling.  I leave it to him if he wants to stay with this,
and if not, I'll volunteer to be accountable to coordinate the upgrade fund
raising (I know, Jim and Herb, I clearly haven't learned a f*cking thing...Boy, 
will my First Shirt have a case of the red *ss if he hears about *this*...)

Anyway, here's a set of rules I propose, open to discussion, for the effort 
regardless of who is in the barrel for coordinating the bucks:

Coordinator sets up bank account in name of "Porschephiles"
Coordinator publishes Bank name and account number to list
DONOR(s) sends check made out to "Porschephiles Acct No #####" to coordinator.
     Back of check is pre-endorsed by donor, 
     "for deposit only to"Porschephiles Acct No #####" 
coordinator sends donor email with number of donors deposit (#1 through  n
     donors)  Donor may be anonymous or public.  Public donors should send mail
     to list with amount donated.
coordinator publishes weekly funds report. Weekly funds report is in 
the following format:

Donation number   Name (anon)  anount   deposit date total to date.
1                 anon          50        2/15/95          50

Coordinator sends money to Stan
Stan gets rich, he and Mary run off to beautiful downtown Grozny and set

   Well, maybe there's a bug or two here, but  this is only version 1.0.  
   If I can get my hands on a pentium, I can work them out by version

at some time, say weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or whatever, transfers shall be
made to Stan for his disposition, as he sees fit.  Allowable uses of the
fund shall be *strictly* limited to those things Stan deems proper.  Such 
uses shall include, but not be limited to, Computers, Software. Porsches,

Hmmm, I own one of those "water pumping variants", but I must admit, I

My car has been basically hibernating on and off for the past 4 years,
running it every month or so (in the winter only a few times when the
roads are clean).

Every time I start it, I push it out of the garage, get it rolling down the
hill,
and pop the clutch in 2nd gear with the key in the ON position.
This gets oil pressure up in a few seconds without the engine running.
Then I stop the car and start it with the starter. My MFI engine will not
start
right without the priming" squirt from the starter position.

It's my poor-man's accusump. Luckily I have no power features (steering,
brakes, etc) so it is easy, but in a 944 it could be a problem.

I hear that the majority of engine wear comes from cold starts, so I hope
my engine hasn't worn at all in the last 4 years.

To: Porschephiles

Subject: 912 Problem, the Answer





     God, you guys are Good! Out of 30 E-mails concerning the "seized"

912 Problem, 8 hit the nail on the head- including our Fearless Leader,

Stan!  So the Maestro's gonna reveal the Answer before he runs out

of Spec Books.

    If you'll remember the problem:

       The new '69 912 engine had been running fine untl the 

owner pulled off to get gas, whereupon he heard a horrible 

grinding sound from the engine, followed by the Sound of Silence. 

And a "seized" engine. Towed to the Maestro's  Shop, the Maestro

discovered that neither a fresh 12 Volt battery nor his 

Metric Adjustible Wrench, attached to the pulley would turn it over.



And now, for Part 2:

    Moan! Groan! Beseech the Porsche gods. Break the Emergency Virgin

Case and sacrifice one to the gods. Still, the engine refused to turn 

over with the Starter or a wrench on the pulley nut! 

     The Maestro wandered around the shop in an 

angry/depressed/self-pitying haze for a while until his 

Center of Higher Reasoning decided it was time to step in. 

     "OK", it said, sounding like Mrs. Maestro.

so you've got a problem. Big Deal. Pull the engine. Find out

what's wrong. And fix it. Besides, there might be a Story there. 

     So, the Maestro gritted his teeth, grabbed his tools and attacked 

the seized 912 with a newfound passion. Inside of half an hour he had 

the wires disconnected, the mount bolts off, the engine lowered and 

out of the car.    

    As he pulled it out from under the 912, the Maestro wondered just 

what the hell had gone so wrong to seize it up tighter than a bull

in fly time. 

    He grabbed the flywheel and pulled/pushed back and forth to see 

ifin it was a broken crank or a loosened flywheel nut. No. He tried 

rotating the flywheel by hand. It rotated nicely. 

   IT ROTATED NICELY???!!! Wait a minute! I thought you said it was seized!|

   It WAS seized- before, when it was in the car! The Maestro 

glanced at the pulley as he rotated the flywheel- the pulley now TURNED!

The Engine was NOT seized! 

    So, what the hell happened??? THe Maestro grabbed the Main Shaft of the

912's transmission and rotated it. It rotated freely! 

    Well, what's left??? What could have caused this???

    The Maestro thought about this for a little while and then- his 

Center of Higher Reasoning made a Connection! Of Course- you idiot- 

it had to be that. What else can it be? 

    It was the STARTER! Somehow the El-Cheapo, non-Bosch rebuilt

Starter stuck its mechanical foreskin into the flywheel when the 

engine was running! Which accounts for the funny grinding

sounds. Fortunately, the flywheel ring ring gear teeth were none the

worse for wear.

     And, off course, when the Maestro pulled out the starter- 

sho' 'nough the pinion gear of the Starter looked like an incompetent 

dentist had ground down half of its teeth! 

     Somehow, the starter had engaged its teeth into the flywheel- making

a good flywheel LOCK- not unlike the flywheel lock the Maestro uses to 

keep the flywheel from turning when he tightens the flywheel nut down!|

    It was something the Maestro had NEVER seen before (and hopes he 

never sees again!). 

    Fortunately, the ring gear teeth of the flywheel were OK, but to be

sure the Maestro fired the engine up on the ground. All was fortunately

well. So back in it went! 

   Now, of course, had the Maestro thought this thing through- he mightave

concluded that the Only Possible Cause was obviously the Starter and
replaced

it straight away, instead of pulling the engine.

But then, this Story wouldn't have been nearly as much fun, now would it? 

    These things happen when you:|

KEEP THE 356 FAITH!!!

Parade has NOT sold out very early in recent memory. The Cincinnati Parade,
for example, closed out about 2 weeks prior to the Parade itself and that was
more for convinience than being oversold.  Based on the past ten years
experience, if you get your entry postmarked on the first legal day, you WILL
get in.  The last Parade that I know of that was sold out real early and
turned away first day registrants was the Ashville Parade in the early '80's.
Some Parades have taken entrants during Parade week itself. Portland may be
different, since they will have a Driver's school and a race tied into the
event, tow STRONG inducements to travel that far.  Late entries could also
get closed out of meal packages even though they get into Parade itself since
those are now required to be purchased up front.

Subject: Re: C-2 Turbo Wheels on an '86 911


For 9" wheels you'll have to get to 23.3mm offset 

(911 7, 8" wheels are 10.8, 9" are 23.3, and 951 7, 8", before '87 are 23.3.

You'll need to get to 10.8 in the front to fill things out with a 7" wheel.  With 8" 23.3 is optimum since it puts the extra inch all on the inside (moves offset ~1/2" or 12.5mm)

Assuming the 7" are 53.3mm offset, as standard for C2, There are to get the extra 30mm of hub you'll need in the front:

1) Run spacers (30mm is a commpn size, don't forget the longer studs,
or buy those "bolt on" spacers, whcih I don't trust)

2) Upgrade to 81+ 930 hubs and calipers.

Option 2 is more costly, but if you're thinking of it, it's a good
time.

In the rear you're pretty much stuck with using spacers.  If the offset
is 53.3mm (that should be stamped inside a spoke or available from the
dealer), the difference is again 30mm.

I ran the 8" C2 wheels on the front of my 911 SC -w- 930 hubs.  They
could have used about 10mm more outset, but they fit fine -w-
245-45-16s.

On the topic of offset, I just stuffed 9.5 + 11.5 -w- 275-40-17 and
315-35-17 under my (now) 930 bodied car.  Took a while to guess it
right.  If anyone needs offsets for this I now have them.

Subject:      Million $ Cars!!!

I had the most unexpectedly thrilling experience when I went to pick up my 928
from getting its new stereo installed!  The shop in Rockville, Maryland shares
garage space with a BMW repair shop.  When I got there they informed me that my
 stereo had taken a LOT longer to instal than they had expected, and were still
 working on it (this is at 7PM! on a Friday!)  They invited me back to the gara
ge to watch him finish up.  First thing I see when I walk into the garage: a 73
 BMW 2002 BAUER convertible!  While I am exclaiming, the stereo guy says, "what
? The one up on the rack?" and I said no, the one in front of me!  Wondering wh
at he thought I was exclaiming at, I look over at one of the car lifts and see
a '57 BMW **507**!!!!  That made my mouth drop and I was speechless!  I finally
 managed to utter "...507...507...507!...less than 300 in the WORLD".  He said
"yeah, it's worth a million dollars, has the most bizzare V8 I've ever seen..."
I walked around it a while and noticed that it had some rust and normal wear,
in other words; THIS CAR IS DRIVEN!  To make a long story short, I started look
ing around at other cars sitting around and noticed a *brand new* '70's BMW 3.0
CSi Alpina, and then some cars with parachute covers on them...  I walked over
and lifted up one cover and discovered a BMW 2002 *pickup truck*!  And, are you
 ready for this?  The last car over in the corner was a PORSCHE 904!!!!!!!!!!!!
I lost it.  I was sitting (I had to sit to get down to its level!) with #12 of
12 Porsche 904's in the world.  It was beautiful and very orange.  Quite and ex
perience... By the way, the new stereo system was done *superbly*.  Everything
was done as stealthly as possible and came out perfectly.  If anyone wants to
know how to build a full range system in a 928, e-mail me.  My question is:
How much is that BMW 507 worth?   How much is a 904 worth?  Why are they here,
in Maryland?!!?!?!?!

Subject:      Paint update...

I want to thank everyone who gave me advice on dealing with my school and the
damage that happened to my 928's paint.  The update is that their insurance is
coming out to look at the damage on Tuesday.  I talked to the guy on the phone
and he said that he just needed to see the damage and that he could pretty much
 give me a decision right then and there.  This sounds pretty positive to me,
like he is checking to see if I am making up the damage or not.  I'm not, so I
am pretty hopefull that it will all work out.  My only worry is that he will
see that the paint in places was chipped alredy and the clear coat was coming
off in places.  The damage that happened on school property has eaten through
the paint near these chips and looks way worse (it's white on black paint).
So, my question is:  What do I say if he sees that the paint around the damaged
 area is less than perfect and says that the damaged area needed to be painted
already?  Thanks for any insight...  Sean  '80 928

From: fhess@free.org (Fred L Hess)
Subject: Re: Need some flames

Here's the story of T*d per Pete.
 (forwarded with his permission)
 








It's kind of hard to describe. The T*d was one T*d Matsumura (the * is
because I think Stan installed something that will blast any message coming
from The T*d; seems there is a strong possibility he was trying to mailbomb
the list at the end of this sordid affair).
 
Anyway, T*d lived in an alternate universe. Some things that come to mind:

1) Narrow tires are better for slalom than wide tires. On some cars. On some
tracks. Sometimes. You'd have to ask a slalomin' fool like The T*d to tell
you exactly what is the right tire for your car.  

2) T*d told us on several occasions what a hard drivin' son of a gun he is,
canyon racing in the Bay Area for years and years, he knows somethin' about
drivin' an' racin.'
 
3) T*d ran his first slalom while on this list. He has I think a 77 911 with
an updated 78 3.0 liter SC engine. He was beaten by FIVE SECONDS by another
first timer and his wife driving a stock, "lowly" 1972 911 E with its 2.4
liter engine. Musta had really narrow tires. People who have seen him drive
said he was really spectacular -- spectacularly out of control.
 
4) T*d once told us what tires he runs -- turns out he had three or four
different BRANDS of tire on his car -- Toyo, Riken, Dunlop, I don't know
what all. I posted some sort of message about his "entire Franklin Mint
Collection of Famous Performance Tires" or something.
 
5) T*d once claimed that the Factory saved 6 lbs per wheel by going to
centerlock wheels on their race cars. (How much do YOUR lugnuts weigh?)
 
6) T*d kept trying to sell these beat up wheels to the list. I think they
were BBS alloys. He bounced the car off a curb. He was very proud that the
wheels did not break, only bend. Factory forged wheels break, he says. Cast
wheels are stronger, he says. Steel wheels? He wouldn't let his dog drive on
steel wheels. (I have steel wheels on all my 356s because that's what 356s
have. Most cars ever made have steel wheels. They work. They're not as light
and not as sexy but they hold the round black things.) As a result of his
exploits I dubbed him Curbsurfer T*d. He claims to have a place that can do
a beautiful job of rebending bent alloy wheels. Several people on the list
pointed out to him that bend wheels make great coffee tables but are no
longer safe for the road, even after straightening. Went right over his head.

7) KYB shocks are better than all that German crap. Cheaper too.
 
8) This is what finally got him thrown off the list -- apparently he posted
a message signed "Ferry Porsche" saying how great F. Porsche finds this
Porschephiles thing on the information superhighway and by the way, if
anybody has any questions about how to set up their cars for slalom, contact
Porsche's U.S. representative, T*d Matsumura.
 
9) After T*d was thrown off the list, there were numerous breakin attempts,
apparently not without some success, to Stan's system. Stan ain't happy
about that, because the system is his livelihood (not Porschephiles; he does
something else with his system that makes real money). (snipped!!)
 
10) T*d started his own 911 list. Unfortunately he decided to junkmail the
thing to EVERYBODY on Porschephiles. I didn't want it. Neither did lots of
other people, and told him to drop their names immediately. It didn't
happen. People mailed him again. Still no drop. People started getting mad
at Stan and Porschephiles for the added bandwidth (lots of stuff from The
T*d's list was getting posted 3, 4, 5 times, I think) so they asked to be
dropped from Porschephiles too. I couldn't get The T*d to take me off the
list by asking nicely, so I called his place of employment, where his net
serve lives, got the legal department voicemail, and left a VERYnastyGram.
Surprise, the junk mail stopped. T*d wasn't happy (calls me a racist; not
true, I hate everybody, especially fools of any race, color, creed, or
political party) but the messages stopped and that's all I care about.
 
See, Porschephiles with The T*d was always an adventure. You'd wake up in
the morning and rush to the machine to see what the blithering idiot has
done now, and how some of the more prominent flamethrower artists
responded.It was just beautiful. Sigh. Now we have conversations about
windshield washers. It just ain't the same. That's why I proposed we create
our own "virtual T*d" so anybody could flame him, or pretend to be him to
flame others back -- just for entertainment, not to actually flame any real
person.

The high performance Nokia snow tires are called NRWs.  I have them on

make it up a 20 deg incline without any problem), not bad handling (a

Here's one for you Porsche friends:
	Has anyone ever replaced the upper balance shaft bearing
due to wear? I'm getting this rattling noise, and it sure seems
to be comming from the rear cover of the cam housing. Looking at the
manual, it seems that there is one bearing in the back of the
balance shaft and the other one is in the front where the seals are.

The car has 95K miles. The noise only occurs in a very narrow
engine speed range. It happens on acceleration,about 1.5K, goes away after
about 2K RPM, and then it happens again as the engine revs down from
a higher RPM range.

Yep, those're the ones! At our dealership we had 175/65/14s, 185/65/15, and 
195/65/15s in the Hakk 10s, and 205/65/15s in NRWs. We were also selling 
wheel/tire packages, with wheels from Tire Rack. A few customers insisted 
on the Blizzaks, which came from Tire Rack, but I dunno, they sure don't 
LOOK anywhere near as good at the Hakk 10s. (I have the Hakks on my 
Sentra winter car - when was the last time you saw unidirection 155/13 
tires? :)

But anyways, we sell tons of the snow tires. They make a HUGE difference...

Somehow I wonder if this could be 100% true. Otherwise anyone could

Were talking about forgery sure, but I tend to feel (like with art) that the

>Subject: 912E#1 totalled

Wait a minute ! I missed the original thread on this. Did you say that the 
76 912E vin# 91260000001 was totalled? Don't tell me that the mechanic he 
sold it to backed it into a wall or tree at a high rate of speed! Is the car 
<really> totalled ?

Yes, anyone who's played with the edge on a 91* has either come near or 
actually spun. The key there is to leave a lot of room for recovery (as in 
room to stop). I've done it twice unintenionally and been lucky both times 
(read lots of room).

I propose a warning plaque on the instrument panel of all 91*'s:

        WARNING: (1) BEFORE FLIGHT CHECK YOUR EQUIPMENT
                 (2) BEFORE FLIGHT PLAN YOUR ROUTE
                 (3) BEFORE FLIGHT CHECK THE PILOT

Harry,

Ok I'll admit I'm starting logically here but that won't last: If it's not 
the new power plant it must have something to to with what the power plant 
is connected to. On my 912 the transmission is connected to the engine so 
that must be it. Of course I'll have to be more specific and this is where I 
start guessing a bit: The flywheel rubs against the pressure plate which 
drives the transmision, but wait if the engine does not turn because of the 
transmission then the engine would have been spinning when the car was being 
towed! Ouch. well as long as they did'nt go too fast.

I had my clutch seize while I was restoring my 912. I would not release but 
I was able to turn the engine by hand (the car would move too).

Well then my logic falls apart here. If the clutch did not sperate for some 
reason then you would still have been able to at least 'budge' the car with 
the starter. Unless if the transmission had turned to rock.

Let me guess: You pulled the engine to find that it fired up fine. I'm 
tempted to blame the clutch throwout fork/bearing but you would have felt it 
when you pressed the clutch in. So I'll blame it on a loose roll pin caught 
by the flywheel (starter teeth).

Don't keep me in suspence too long :->

I've just stopped laughing so that I can breathe again ! But wait a

can be true. Come on now, this is a joke right? Ghost writers trying their 
luck at humor ? I get it, these are true stories happening to different

Subject: 914 2.0 FI retrofit

The other day I asked about whether I should buy a 1973 914 2.0 liter with
Webers, Konis front/Bilsteins rear, Yokos, "Euro pistons", CD ignition, no
rust. I was concerned that someday soon the car would be unregisterable due
to the non-original carbs.

The consensus on the net was that FI is preferable. And, if the rest of the
U.S. follows California the car will indeed someday be unregisterable.

Problem is, I still like the car. If I have to spend $1000 (wild guess) on a
used FI setup, the car might still be worthwhile.

But here's my question. The car has a "hotter" cam and somewhat larger
pistons. (Don't know specifics yet.) One mechanic says it will still run OK
with stock FI, but the idle may be a little rough. Another expert (one I'm
more likely to trust) says it will never run acceptably with the stock FI
and a hotter cam.

Any opinions on this out there?  

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Shaving Tires

Folks,

I am in need of some porschephiles wisdom.

I ordered a set of BFG R1 230 compound tires for the upcoming
autocross season. However, I forgot to order them "shaved". I
have read in my Team TA newsletter that the tires will last
longer and work better if they are shaved. So, I have these
questions:

1. Should I have the tires shaved?
2. If yes, to what tread depth?
3. Who does this in the San Jose area that can be trusted to
   do it right?

On a slightly different subject, how do the BFG R1 users out
there breakin your autocross tires?

Subject: 914 1st gear fixed -- accidentally

Fred and I bought a bushing kit to try to fix the 1st gear in our 73 914 
2.0L...

We took the gearshift lever arrangement out of the car, found that it all 
looked fine, and the bushings we had were for further back anyway, and so 
we put it back. 

We obviously bolted the gearshift lever stuff back onto the 
long rod a little differently than it had been on, because now first gear 
works perfectly. As does reverse and all the other gears. The bolt which 
tightens the lever mechanism to the rod is obvious -- it is in a hole you 
can see if you take the stuff off the shifter.

Now first gear lever slides right into a "further down"  position which 
engages every time, whether standing or moving.

The factory manual in fact says that to adjust the gearshift, one loosens 
the bolt and rotates the long rod and then tightens the bolt. You can get 
to the bolt without taking anything apart, there is a hole in the top of 
the lever mechanism to get to it. ANd trial and error would probably work 
like it did for us.

I hope this is clear for the dozen or so of you who indicated you had the 
same problem. This car is a great joy to drive, but now it is even 
better: I do not gnash my teeth -- like gears -- at lights!

Have fun.

Mark

I believe the proper way to breakin R1s is to get them fully warm and then
let them sit for at least 24 hours.  This allows them to fully complete

Well, make that 4 RS Americas.  I went to drivers' ed at Sebring in late

driver lost the brakes going down the straight of the short track and
couldn't make the hairpin turn. He missed the turn going about 70mph, went
through the grass, up an embankment and stopped and the car then fell over
onto its' roof. He was fine but the car was totalled. This is all second

Folks,

Before we start collecting money for new or additional hardware, I would
like to know what the current hardware situation is and what the problems
are.  For the money I've seen thrown around, I would imagine Stan could buy
a system dedicated to the porschephiles list.

I want to hear some proposals on what the money will be used for. For
example, it would be very nice if Stan was able to move the mail list, WWW,
ftp, etc to a seperate system.  This would allows us to ftp files to and
from the system at all hours of the day unless Stan's network has a
bandwidth problem.

I just want know what I will be paying for.....

What I wanted to say, but very cleverly said the

This poses a small problem for people from outside the US. For me it a _lot_
cheaper transferring the $ directly into the bank-account. That "only" costs
$20 - checks costs around $75 to have made out.

Why send mail to the list? Wouldn't the weekly funds report suggested below

Hmmm... This part bothers me a small bit. If the only purpose it to ship
money to Stan I'd say it's a bit too commercial for my taste.

Besides I think newcomers will have a problem understanding why we are 
shipping money to the list-meister. Most mailing lists do not ship money
around.

I have another suggestion. It might be way off or completely insane, but I'm

always open to being told that :-). Why not make this the first Virtual
Porsche Club in the world?

We could pay a yearly fee, say $15 (or $20 or whatever), for being a member.
The money would of course be shipped to Stan for equipment related to the
club (no booze here, unless he needs a steady hand to set it up - only
kidding :-) ). The club could the have a president (Stan), a board, a cashier 
and whatever else is needed in a regular club.

Then some time down the road we could have virtual autox and track races when
evebody gets their VR-helmets in place <g>. Okay, okay my mind went crazy for
a moment, but you get the (crazy) idea.

Perhaps we can even get the OK from Porsche for being an official club :-)

Would that it were true. Others on the net have met The T*d, and seen him
drive (in a manner of speaking). For a while I believed that they were
playing along with Stan in creating an artificial personality, but when the
mailbombing started, all doubts were erased. Somebody once described T*d as
"an experiment in artificial intelligence, gone horribly wrong." He exists.
 
After he got dumped, I suggested we do exactly what you suspected -- create
our own 'artificial personality,' a sort of Max Headroom of Porschephiles,
where people could say stupid things and flame one another all in good fun
(pretending to be, say, Max Headgasket) and be flamed back in turn, with no
hard feelings either way. It would be a way for the flamethrower artists
to practice their craft. Nobody picked up on it.

To the list:

I've quitely sitting back and reading all of the suggestion on how to help
Stan and to me the seems to make the most sense. Instead of a one time
donation the membership would be collectly yearly allowing Stan a regular
"income" from which to make his system upgrades....

Subject: Parade Registration

Just want to reinforce/clarify several of the messages over the past week
regarding registration, wait lists, etc.

My significant other was the Registrar for the 1991 Parade in Boston, as well
as for the 1994 Parade in Lake Placid.  I guess that qualifies him as an
"expert!"

The reality is that a Parade has not been sold out since the Downeast Parade
in 1986.  We were, in fact, #56 on the wait list after the initial
registration opening day.  We did, in fact, get into the Parade, and knew
this by the middle of May (Parade was held in July).

If you are interested in attending the Portland Parade this year, and have
not yet submitted a registration form, I encourage you to do so in the near
future.  You are not likely to be waitlisted, nor, at the very worst, shut
out of the opportunity to attend/participate.

The Cincinnati Parade also offered attendees the opportunity to combine their
Parade experience with a couple days of drivers education at the Mid-Ohio
track in nearby Lexington, Ohio.  This still did not cause the Parade to be
sold out.

Jon Lowe was correct that the Parade officials may, at some point, decide to
close out the Parade registration because at some point the paperwork and
recordkeeping must be finalized.

Bottom line....go for it!  It is a great experience, and an opportunity to
meet a bunch of fun peopole who also happen to own Porsches.

I need some diagnostic help.
Two days ago I drove my '83 911 SC about 85 miles at an average speed of
70mph.   Temperature was in the high 20s.  As I braked getting off the
expressway and fell below 40mph the car stalled.  I stopped and the car
started right up, but then stalled again.  It started right up again and with
 a little help on the throttle I made it to a light a few 100 yards away
where the car stalled again.  Once again it started right up and I drove
perhaps a mile where I had to stop - car ran perfectly.  The car has
continued to operate perfectly.
What could the problem have been?  Is it serious?  Is it likely to happen
again, but worse?   Any help would be appreciated.

For the sizes you are running (I think 225s fr. and 245s rear?) -- you might
be able to get away with what we did last season on the 226s (same carcass
 -- same general characteristics).  We ran full depth in the rear and shaved
the fronts to 4/32nds.  the fronts, if run at full depth, would scallop
badly and wear quicker than when shaved.  I don't know about who might shave
tires in San Jose, but Roger Krause Racing shaves tires (Hayward I think).
 For maximum life at minimal degradation in performance BFG recommends a
complete initial heat cycle which is bringing the tires up to temperature
without abusing them (will be difficult to do in winter), which for 230s is
in the 150 deg + range, then pulling them off the car (but not off the
wheels) and letting them "cure" for 24 - 48 hrs.  The tires are not properly
heat cycled by merely heating them (as in using an oven), but by "working"
them, albeit not aggressively.  Most of this info comes from Jim Fogerty who
is a BFG tire engineer -- "father" of the current R1 series -- he listens in
on the team.net list.  I may have his compuserve address at work if you want
more specific info...

Pretty much so. You also need some other odd bits of metal, but I used to have
several 914-6s in my desk drawer - title, VIN plate, window tag with serial
number, and some of the other odd bits. 

More than one '70 914 1.7 became an "authentic" 914-6 that way.

Done right, even an expert can't tell the diff. Particularly if an
expert did the work in the first place. You can't fake things, you
must use the exact right parts. You have to do concours grade work.
You have to make sure a priori that you *KNOW* that the donor car
(i.e. the car the VIN came from) is destroyed and that you can effectively
despose of the "remains" of the target car (i.e. it's VIN number and
registration). It's also useful to know that the target car isnt' stolen,
but that's a legal issue... That's for "street cars".

In the superexotic market, where you're dealing with true one-off cars
or very, very limited production cars like 917s or *REAL* '73 RSRs
(what was that Excellence article about the RSR a few years ago --
"113 made, 5000 sold"??) things get tougher. You *CAN'T* just fabricate
a car from scratch and have it accepted. You *CAN* however, **REBUILD** a
car completely from scratch -- if you have the basic right pieces, you
can even get the factory to authorize re-issuance of the VIN tags. That
sort of thing used to happen in the Ferarri market all the time a few
years ago -- someone would come up with a slagged wreck with the correct
provenance to indicate that it was so-and-so's racer from the mid '50s and
had been damaged beyond repair in the '80s and gosh it would be a shame
to NOT bring it back from the dead... See also a fairly recent Excellence
where doing the same for a 904 was discussed.

Subject: Proposal to the List Membership

Folks,

This is fairly long, please bear with me.  I've been thinking about this for 
a couple of days now, and I have come up with *exactly* the right idea. 
Please weigh this, evaluate it, and get back to me. 

The issue is this: how to keep Porschephiles on the air in perpetuity.

To date, I've done this from my own pocket. At first, it was just
a corner of a machine I had charge of at Baylor College of Medicine
and tacit approval to consume network resources. Then I re-hosted to
a semi-publicly available system there controlled by a group at the
University of Houston that I farmed certain consulting work out to. 

Then several years ago, it moved to tta.com, when my consulting group went 
on-line. Since then, the list has nudged it's way off the main hardware here 
to take up it's own complete system, and is eating a larger and larger 
fraction of our T1 to the Internet. With my day-to-day involvement in the 
consulting practice going to near zero last year while I was off doing 
NetSmiths, and with my new involvement in TeleCommute SolutionS and 
TCS-OMNInet taking me further away from TTA, it seems likely that we'll 
need to move again.

I have considered turning this into a profie center by taking offers I've
received (unsolicited) from a few smaller on-line service providers to
partner with them. While that solves one problem, it creates many more
and does not serve the list membership very well.

I would like Porschephiles to have a permanent home, a domain name
that's NOT tied to a company, newer faster hardware, and the ability
to support it's own direct Internet connection should that time ever
come when it *MUST* do so or die. I do not wish do to this in a way
that I personally profit from, except recovery of costs incurred 
going forward if possible. Once some of my other involvements are hitting
on all cylinders again, even that is not necessary except that if it's 
part of the plan, then it will NEVER be an issue again if I hit shortfalls.

The following observations have been made:

* "We are a Porsche Club Region in the Internet Era." (Pasha)

* "why not print up some "porschephiles@tta.com" window stickers" (Ryan)

* "Why not have a T-shirt too" (Marefat)

* "I also belong to the british-cars list (affectionately known
   as the Scions Of Lucas --SOL)  and the list has come up with
   an SOL logo on computer which various companies have printed
   on stickers, shirts, mugs, etc.  Might be a good idea to do
   a similar thing on this list, yes?" (Radsick)

* "Does anyone (Pete, Jim, Larry, Harry, anyone) with close ties to PCNA 
  think they could get corporate permission to use the crest, or have 
  interest in pursuing the issue with them?" (Chambers)

OK, anyone who's ever been closely involved in Region management enough to
have read the Manual should be able to see the synergy here:

- --> How about forming Porschephiles as a PCA Region??

This gives us several things:

1) right to charge dues and mechanism to collect them (via PCA)

2) additional revenue via PCA special distributions to Regions

3) affiliation with a 501(c)6 non-profit institution that umbrellas
   us if the right safeguards are taken

4) right to use the various bits of PCNA intellectual properties for
   purposes of promoting the Region and it's events (crest, etc)
   This includes goodie store items.

5) PCA members with other Home Regions can also affiliate with us, and
   those that wish may have this be their Home Region and affiliate with
   other local regions.

6) right to admit non-members to our "events" so non-members are
   not excluded in this change (I *WILL NOT* tolerate a solution that
   is exclusionary).

7) we can seek to register the "pca.org" domain, and issue a subdomain
   as the permanent address for Porschephiles. We can also provide 
   name registry services, and possibly other services, for other PCA
   regions and national board functions.

It imposes some other requirements:

* we need members, that means current PCA members. That also means that
  we can recruit NEW members.

* we have to pass through an approval process at PCA, which means we 
  may need "friends" including letters of committment, recommendation,
  etc.

* there needs to be a club managment structure which provides appropriate
  checks and balances. That means volunteers (even the kind that are
  pushed forward) for P, VP, Treas., Sec. Event Chair, NL Editor, etc.

* there may need to be conference calls for the management team from
  time to time to satisfy some other odd bits of law

* we need to figure out what sort of "events" an *ON-LINE* region can have.
  I can see how we'd do the newsletter 8{), but other things are harder?
  Do we autox by running locally and then applying some math function to
  "predict" the winner in "our" event?? Do we have concours by uploading
  GIF files?? Do we have tours by linking up in person?? You get the 
  picture...

Anyway, I'm throwing down the gauntlet on this:

Monday, I will call Ruth and request the Formation of a New Region Kit. 
I will register intent for form a new region, the Electronic Frontier Region.

If you are currently a PCA member, and wish to be a founding member
of the EFR, send me either via public post or private mail:

	your name and name of your affiliate member as it appears on the
	PCA membership card
	your current region affliation
	your current address (as far as PCA goes)
	your membership number

If the region is accepted, I'll put out the call for initial startup 
contributions and instructions on where to send those.   Let's move
smartly -- I'd like to have something done by the weekend...

First of all, thanks to all those that sent suggestions of good junk yards!
E.A.S.Y. in particular was a good spot.  They are not big, and had only
3 914's when I dropped by, but they had what I wanted at a _very_ good
price.   The staff was both helpful and knowledgable, and let us climb
around in back to look around (always a wallet buster).  Definitely two
thumbs up!
Also I would like to mention that if you have the time, the standard junk 
yards, can have amazing deals!  The two that I went to in Hayward, 
Doris and Pick Your Part, did have porsches.  Doris in fact had a surprising
amount of European cars including audi's, bmw's, and others.  I also saw
several 924's there.  Pick Your Part, had only one 914 that I could see,
but it was still fairly complete as far as junk cars go.  The standard lots
are pretty much a crap shoot, but if you have the time to go looking, it 
sure saves the $$.

Subject: 944 O2 sensor behavior (input at DME)


History - My problem is stumble under load and jumpy, dropout idle in cold 
ambient temps.

Tired of screwing with testing sensors and finding everything OK, and then 
wondering "what is the DME actually seeing".  So, laid open my DME on the 
passenger floor so I could monitor signals with voltmeter.  I know, 
electrostatic damage, sensitive DME electronics, dangerous voltages, big $$$ 
 - life's a risk.  Anyway, question I have is:

Does anyone know what kind of voltage behavior I should see at the DME O2 
sensor input?

I expected to see something hovering pretty tightly around 0.45 volts or so. 
 But instead I saw [with respect to DME input pin 1 GND] a slowly 
oscillating voltage ranging from about -12.5v to -13.5v.  Same pin pretty 
well stuck at -13.0v with O2 sensor disconnected at back of engine.  So I 
did see the characteristic 1v ranging like I thought O2 sensors generate, 
but such a negative level?  And why can't it seem to hold steady at stoich? 
 Is the DME hunting?  This slow 1 to 2 second oscillation was evident at 
idle, steady cruise, and under load from what I could tell from voltmeter 
glances between watching the road.  I'm an EE so I know at least a little 
about electronics but I don't know what is correct behavior on some of these 
inputs.

BTW, FWIW, looks like an INTEL 8705 (8-bitter?) is the micro.  Would kill 
for a schematic of this DME.  Also, trivia, you can actually drive this car 
(limp home) without an Air flow meter or an O2 sensor (learned accidentally 
 - left air flow meter disconnected).  DME must default to idle mixture map 
data - stalls out (lean?) if you go for any revs in this mode.

I'll post ONE summary of any responses if anyone can offer help direct. 
 Thank you to anyone's ideas.  I may not solve my problem but I'm sure as 
hell learning a ton about how my car works [or doesn't work].

Oh, one other question:  How is crankcase ventilated to intake tract?  Saw 
one hose from air filter case to cam belt cover.  Is that it?  Trying to 
explain air leak I saw at oil filler base when I pressurized the intake 
tract at the air flow meter.  Air leaked past rings?

If you just tweak things a little, you can get another 10-15 HP.
You can make up to 150 HP on factory EFI, you can get to over 220 HP for

occosional resurrection of his deeds.

The fact is (Note:this is my *OPINION* only, so no flames) that he displays
many traits of a sociopath. These people frequently are treated as the
"village idiot", or regarded as bizarre or eccentric. They tend to be single
minded, and believe in their visions. Whether right or wrong, nobody can
change their viewpoints. They believe to be the source of a certain
knowledge, and can not understand  that people don't see the light. This may
sound harmless, but can lead to disaster as history has shown repetitively
(Nazi Sheep ???). Let's apply this to T*d:
 -He is transfixed on suspension setup. The general consensus is that he
doesn't have a clue. Yet, again all common wisdom, he persists. He even
participates in autox to prove his points. When that tends to be disastruous,
he still is convinced of his right thinking, and quotes many reasons for his
demise. These do not include "mistakes" in his suspension setup.
 -Certain topics/issues/incidents act like triggers and result in a sudden
change in communications/actions. Remember the allusion to a "darkened out
car with wheels sticking out the wells....". This innocent (to most of the
participants) joke results in a flame war with racist undertone.
 -Unbeaten, T*d proceeds to find an alternative route for his teachings and
self proclaimed expertise. Born is the 911 list. Unbelievably, he manages to
obtain the PORSCHE.ORG domain (are you listening PCNA ???).
 -The innocent "village idiot" becomes an Internet guerilla when access to
porschephiles is denied. And that's where danger lurks. When someone gets in
the way of their goals, it's a justified and holy war. Breakins, mail bombing
etc... Fortunately, this has been limited to the virtual reality of the
Internet.
 -The unsolicited inclusion on the 911 list has to be seen in the same light.
It is not harassement, but an attempt to show you the truth, uncensored by Evi
l Stan. 

What I am trying to say is that T*d did indeed add color to Porschephiles
initially. Intuitively, Stan saw probably a different picture after a while,
something that triggered his decision to terminate. I believe it to be the
right move as T*d's subsequent actions have proven. Ultimately, it's a sad,
sad story: what was hilarious as a perceived fictitous character, is sad as a
real human being.

And to conclude, the 911 list is almost an exclusive monolog. The 7x16 Golden
BBS RA wheel with the "slight dent" is still for sale @ $70.00 (with the
comment that Porsche Racing uses BBS wheels). If you have a 26mm rear torsion
bar (from 930) for a '77 911S, you may have a buyer. Ditto for a 22mm rear
sway bar. No plans for a front sway bar yet.

Hope I didn't bore or offend, as this was NEVER the intent....

Subject: 924/944/968 Owners Survey For FAQ

ATTENTION: 924/944/968 OWNERS
THIS IS THE LAST TIME I AM GOING TO POST THIS TO THE LIST!
RESPONSE HAS BEEN GREAT SO FAR, BUT A FEW MORE COULDN'T HURT.
THANKS AGAIN, FOR ALL WHO HAVE REPLIED!!

******************************************************************************

This is the second version of the 944 FAQ Survey Form. I have made a few
corrections (added current mileage, color, corrected spelling etc.) List 
members that have already completed this survey need not do so again. If you 
would like to send me your current mileage that would be great, but it is not 
nessessary

******************************************************************************


Hello All,

I am trying to prepare a owners report survey for the new 924/944/968 FAQ.
The purpose of the survey is to collect maintenance and repair records for the
924/944/968 series. I am including a form to make data input easier for you.

I am not sure what the final format will, but I will get a better idea when I
recieve your input. A comments section will appear at the end of the form for
any additional information you can provide. When completed, it make for some
interested reading, for those who may have a common problem, or would just
like to hear other owners comments and problems, without having to search all
the past archives.

  The more info I recieve the more accurate the survey. Please try to
help if you can. This would be a great addition to the FAQ!

Once I have the compilied the past section of the owners survey, I will
update the the owners report from time to time. This will then be posted
to the FAQ .(also to the list so all can see the results)

The completed form can be sent to me directly for review. DO NOT SEND TO
ENTIRE LIST!!

Mike Kehr  INTERNET:71324.3010@compuserve.com

I was thinking that a mileage format would be a good idea ( repairs and 
maintance list by mileage, and a topic, format ie. Waterpumps, motor mounts, 
clutches etc. Any comments, let me know.

I just saw a beautiful gull wing for sale at the "bitchen" car shop down
the road.  I didn't ask the price, but it did have a big sticker which said
to ask about their 20 year financing plan.

Subject: Senders and Gauges on 924S

Porschephiles,

	My fuel and oil gauges on my 1987 924S are failing me.  The fuel gauge 
reports the wrong level of fuel while the oil pressure gauge moves directly to 
bar 5 once the key is in the 'accessory on' position and when the engine 
is running.  I would like to kindly ask anyone out there who has had 
these problems and how to fix them...

Mainly:
1.  Where is the fuel level sender and how do you get to it and 
repair/replace it?
2.  Which would most likely need repairs or replacement - the oil 
pressure gauge or the sender?  And how would I get to either 
the gauge or the sender and repair/replace them?...

Any information, instructions, warnings, or letters of heartfelt pain 
would be greatly appreciated...

Thanks in advance...

Roberto Rabe

P.S.  I'm all up for the Porschephiles chartering...

I'm pretty new to Porschephiles, but so far am quite impressed with

Katarina (my 914) goes on the road.

Regarding the formation of another PCA region... I've been sorta

around to it. I was planning on joining up either before or soon 
after the car goes back on the road... But I'd certainly be interested

would be a couple other benefits to the local region (I think they 
head down to Watkins Glen every now and then...)

As for meetings, well, I dunno if anyone else is in the Northeast,

Anyone else?

Subject: Stan's 914

P-friends,

As Stan has announced, I bought THE 914. After assuring that Stan really
wanted to sell the car, I did not hesitate. I believed that it would be in
better hands with a porschephile member.
It was an exciting weekend. My new baby arrived, hand delivered by the
Listmeister himself. I kept going over the intricacies of Stan's setup.
As officially a Porschephile car as it gets. Signed by the Listmeister, even
with a TTA license plate !
The porschephile 914 got a good home. Since I've never raced, the future of
the car looks quiet for now. Stan can be assured that the car will not be
butchered and probably will be the subject of many of my P-file questions.

As to the subject of T-shirts, stickers, coffee mugs, I'm all for. How about
windshield screen? May I propose a simple design ? How about  just
"porschephile@tta.com" spelled out in black on white, using a terminal (type
writer) style font ?  I there anyone on the list with experience in these
things ? I am volunteering to help/coordinate/distribute.

You have a primary region usually the one in you town or close by. If 
you find that you do not want to be in that region you can request thru 
national to change your region. If you want to be with two region then 
the second region is a "dual" membership. you will be able to do 
everything but vote.

Subject: Dues etc.

In response to Jeff Kyle's question, my guess is that this is
something that would be worked out with PCA National upon formation of
the cyber-region.  This is a matter that should probably be part of
Stan's proposal.  They'll probably want to know this:  i.e., would
membership in a land-based region be a prerequisite?  Normally, dual
memberships are handled by the regions themselves on an informal
basis.  This would be a special situation, and there would be a number
of ways to go on it.  Part of the regular dues involves a subscription
to _Pano_, and the assumption is that most people don't need two of
these.

Actually, Stan being married to a former supervising therapist for a

with that. Oh, from her clients -- not from my wife! (even though

Oh, I expect *LOTS* of issues to come up... I wound up sitting and chatting
with Bert and Judy about this at Parade in July.

I expect some people will want their primary affiliation to be the
new region. Some of these will want secondary affiliations to their
"normal" local region.  There was a note I saw somewhere in O'Reilly-land
on the 'Web "If you LIVE On-Line, SHOP On-Line"; same has got to apply
to the way at least some people will think about PCA.

I expect a lot of people will want a secondary affiliation to the
new region. Some will want to maintain local affiliation for political
reasons, some because it's more comfortable or is required for some
event-oriented thing. Some will just want to support the list.

I expect that that's the least of the worries that PCA National may
have about this in some respects. Think about the *STAGGERING* cultural 
change this represents. Think about how "left in the dust" this may make 
some of the Old Guard feel. Thing about all the excuses you could
use to kill it if you just didn't want to do it...

When I said we needed friends, I wasn't kidding. Start the press NOW.
I'll have the kit from Ruth as soon as she can send it after I call her
about 9:00 AM my time. Probably mid-week. I'll turn around the paper
work same day, and the process starts. I looked *REAL* hard at what
it takes to start a new region a few years ago (some LSR members may
or may not recall the big flap over elections) and expect this to be
complex, messy, and to take time.

Plan on more like $500 or so for the basics, then whatever it takes to make
it run. Maybe $100 in hose. Maybe $140 in new injectors. Maybe $150 in 
new fuel pump (HINT: buy new injectors, fuel pump, sensors, and contacts.
It makes getting all this running MUUUUCH easier.)

Depends. On the cam, mainly. And what you find "acceptible". There are
two cams that work *FINE* on street EFI cars -- one from SCAT, one
from FAT. There are two more cams that work so-so for street cars,
one from WEB-CAM and one from FAT. There are several that just don't work
right at all on street cars with EFI. Just about everyone makes one 
of those...

Things get even more complicated if you have (God forbid) air conditioning.
Then you not only have to run right idle, you also have to run right
at idle with the A/C compressor engaged. There are very, very few cams
that do that...

There are some idle fixing tricks you can use -- drill out the hole in the
butterfly plate to flow more air, etc. But if you have too much cam, 
you just have too much cam...

Unfortunately, there's no way to tell without splitting the case, or just
trying it, unless you happen to have the cam maker and part number.

Subject: Re: Dues etc.

What Stan said is pretty much what I would envision.  I had started a
postscript in a subsequent post, but my connection got put on hold and
then I got busy with something else.

What would be important as far as PCA goes would be for all list
participants to be PCA members.  Granting regionhood to the list would
enable new members who first become acquainted with PCA via the net to
join that way.  Dual membership in regions now is tantamount to a
newsletter subscription, so list membership would constitute a
perfectly analogous situation.

From my experience as a newsletter editor and region president, I have
noted fees for dual memberships ranging from $12 to $20.  Regions with
better newsletter can command higher fees.  I would expect an on-line
service to be at the high end of the dual membership scale, and
rightly so.

Not exactly. This is #12 of the 12 904/6's (chassis number 906012) This 
is the same car featured in both Automobile Quarterly and Pano back 
around 1970 or '71 when its then owner Vern Kovert installed the "T" top. 
He proceeded to use it as a daily driver, accumulating, I've been told, 
over 175,000 miles on the car.

As far as value, well... last I heard, the owner was interested in 
offers. I know he would take a lot less than $1 million <g>. 

And yes, I must admit to having driven this car, although I was very 
nervous at the time - the owner was in the passenger seat and I knew it 
was worth more, in fact a lot more, than my house.

Thanks Pete for your suggestion to go for the RS replica.
Yes, the RS engine is complete with pump and everything so I think you are
right that I will regret it if I sold it.

I wonder if there any subscribers to the list who have some experience in
converting a '73 T to RS specs.
Besides the engine and the obvious body-parts (flares, bumpers, ducktail),
what about suspension?
I vaguely remember that the RS has some extra stiffening panels here and there.

I would like to come as close as possible to the original without spending
a ridiculous amount of money. This probably excludes the modification to

Hey,

Unlike many of you, I am still able to reap the rivulets of
wisdom that continually drip from T*d's mouth (or is that
just a disgusting drool?).  I never unsubscribed from T*d's
911 list.  He is not near as caustic as he used to be, but in
many ways nothing has changed.  He posted something the 
other day asking if anyone knew where he could get factory
959 bodywork to fit a '77 911.

For those who care, he is still trying to sell his assorted collection of
slightly damaged wheels complete with mismatched tires.  The price is
dropping faster than the value of the peso.  He also now lives in wedded
bliss, having married "Akiko", I think it was.

For a long time, I thought T*d was an artificial intelligence
experiment gone awry, but I think someone actually saw him
at an auto-x (Wing Commander T*D).

Ah, the good ol' days,

Some regions even let you vote when you have "dual" membership with them, 
it just depends on how "over-rulized" the region is and how social they

What is behind the front seats on an RS America? Is it like a speedster with

90% chance that both of these problems are related to the senders and not
the gauges themselves.  Both have fairly high rates of failure.

Fuel level sender is under the luggage compartment carpet, under a woven
fiberglass cloth square, and under a plastic seal (top to bottom, in that
order.)  It is held in place by 5 or 6 allen head bolts (i'm too lazy to go
downstairs to look).  Do not loosen the bolts unless you have less than half
a tank of gas, or you will leak gas all over the place (FIRE HAZARD)...

Once the bolts (and electrical connections) are loosened, you can raise the
sender slowly, while the fuel contained in the sender drains out.  While
repairs can be made, new ones are available from the dealer or used ones are
available from me (blatant plug intended)...

As I said above, most likely the sender, which is located at the passenger
front of the motor, below the oil filter.  For this one, I recommend a new
sender. I have gone through 3 of them in 85 K miles. I would not recommend a
used oil gauge sender, (since I don't have any good ones...) <g>

Sounds like a worn-out O2 sensor. My experience is that you get about 50 to
60K miles out of a Bosch sensor, then have to throw it away.

According to the Probst book (Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management)
the sensor voltage of a new sensor should cycle between 0.2 to 0.8 Vdc.
He also shows a graph of how an aged sensor gets lazy and doesn't output the
proper voltage at the appropriate air/fuel ratios.

For a good sensor, the lambda point is about 500 mVdc, measured at the
sensor connection.

At the base of the rubber boot between the airflow sensor and the throttle
valve is a connection to a 3/4 inch (metric equivalent...) hose which
eventually connects to the top of the breather next to the oil filler tube.
Your problem with the oil has to do with the Orings at the bottom of this
assembly.


You're supposed to pressurize the intake tract at the throttle body, or the
intake manifold, not the airflow sensor.  All you did was pressurize the
crankcase through this hose.

If you want to measure for bad rings, use a leakdown tester at the sparkplug
hole.

The only place I would go for tires that do a good job with mags and imported

WHat I'm thinking of doing, is buying  the tires at the Tire Rack and drop
ship them to Precision Motors in Manville. THey are a reputable Porsche
shop. They will mount them for me. Unfortunately, they do not have alignment
equipment. So I would probably go to Euro Tire for it.

Okay, this is my first post here, so I'm not exactly sure if I'm doing 
this right (but don't everyone mail me "Yup, you are" as I already get 
200 pieces of mail a day)

Problem is... I've got Weber carbs in a '73 911 T (all well and fine, 
everyting seems to be okay with it, it runs well once it gets on its way) 
Now, after it sits for maybe three days or so, it will backfire about 400 
revs into the day, I forget the numbering sequence, but I believe it is:

	O   o
	X   o
	O   o (Oil filter, filler etc. on this side)
	FRONT OF CAR UP

(And it always happens, and it is always EXTREMELY LOUD (not just your 
average joe backfire, but like a cannon)

Now, the other thing, although I haven't again figured out which one, is: 
the same side, very likely same cylinder every 20-30 seconds or so (at 
idle) makes a short pss type noise.... kinda like boom boom boom boom pss 
boom... no longer than one piston cycle, but always the same one, and 
exact timing too.

Any ideas? I think it may be the timing.

There is, simply put, no easy way to do this. "How high is up??" The volume
on this list is what it is, and that's that. Want a low volume list, 
try "yugo-philes"... 8{)

There are a few options that help:

1) faster modems
2) better mail software. Since you're coming in via AOL, contact their
   tech support and see if they have something better suited to the task.
   Ideally, you want to be able to download the From/Subject pairs and
   select which messages you want to download. 
3) if AOL can't help, change to a local Internet Services Provider and
   use better mail software. I use ELM, and manage to read just over 350
   messages a day -- about half of which are work, the others from various
   non-work lists I monitor.

2.  All 914 impellor fans are the same when new, then marked for 1.7, 2.0
with a white or 0 notch for TDC and a red mark for 27 degrees BTDC. 1.8
models are marked with a red notch for 7 degrees BTDC only.

3.  Vacuum hose kits with proper vacuum cartoon and precut are available

    1. 70 - 73 1.7
    2. 74 - 75 1.8
    3. 73 - 74 2.0
    4. 75 - 76 2.0

4. 73 - 74 2.0 injectors are the best for overall performance on a 2.0 engine
as 75 - 76 injectors run leaner. We always install 73 - 74 2.0 injectors in
all 73 - 76 914 2.0 (of course as a set).

Subject: Re: 914 lube points? (long - sorry)


Dear Nathan,

I. 914 mechanical lube points front to rear are as follows:

   1. Inner and outer front wheel bearings:  repack with axle grease.
   2. Tie rod ends inner and outer:  rueglide or silicone grease.
   3. Upper strut bushings:  rueglide or silicone grease.
   4. Front and rear torsion bar bushings:  rueglide or silicone grease.
   5. Rear suspension bushings inner and outer:  Rueglide or silicone grease.
   6. CV joints (4): repack with moly grease
   7. Front engine mounts, rear transmission mounts:  rueglide or silcone
grease
   8. Engine:  40W oil summer; 20W50 winter (oil bath air cleaner filled to
red line)
   9. Transaxle:  Quaker state special 80/90 weight VW Porsch transaxle
lubricant.

II. Porsche rips us with a $51.00 914 owners manual when all of the current
ones are only about $25.00. We, with permission, duplicated the no longer
available 72 owners manuals, but a good copying job costs us $35.00 each. If
you can read German, we have a factory new 71 manual for only $25.00.

III. Since you already have stainless steel exchangers, they should easily
unbolt from the head. Just make sure you lubricate the nuts over night before
unbolting and replace them with the copper locking variety.

     The stainless exchangers have a much narrower wall than the factory
steel ones, so they are harder to seal. Make sure you dress both pipe tops
together with a large flat file, replace the copper sealing rings with new
ones, making sure the old ones are removed (Some people have double stacked
them like idiots hoping for extra seal) and finally, mount each heat
exchanger individually torqueing the nuts in an "X" pattern until snug (about
18 ft. lbs.). If you happen to break or strip a stud, replacements are
available in 8, 9 and 10mm size or oversize and the head is easily tapped
(carefully!).

    As an addendum, always make sure the muffler bracket is firmly installed.
It takes the muffler/heat exchanger weight off the head studs, saving them
from exhaust leaks.

IV. Pedrinnin alloys, originally painted by the manufacturer are easily
refinished with a high quality silver wheel paint (like Wurth) with all of
the wheel straightening companies now in the U.S. and the rarity and value of
Pedrinnis (they are not available new). Don't ever take a hammer to your
wheel or you will encur the wrath of Dr. 914!

    Valve clearance is most easily checked with a 10 inch feeler gauge. This
provides ready access for the hard to access adjusters!

Subject: 914 storage


from letter to Benjamin Beasley:

914 storage is easily accomplished in a heated dehumidified garage. The
following steps should be followed:

1. Steam clean complete underneath of car and thoroughly dry.
2, Add the right amount of gas stabilizer (such as POR-15) into the tank and
completely fill with gasoline, operate engine until solution has had time to
work through to the injectors. Top tank to the brim.
3. Remove the spark plugs, squirt oil in the cylinders and turn the engine
over to coat the cylinders. Reinstall plugs loosely.
4. Change engine oil and refill adding an extra quart.
5. Thoroughly bleed the brake system with fresh fluid.
6. Relieve the pressure on the windshield washer bottle.
7. Remove the battery and eacid the area with battery cleaner or baking soda
and water.
8. Lubricate all rubber seals with silicone and thoroughly carnuba wax the
car. Install flannel-lined car cover.
9. Elevate car and rest on padded jackstands under floor pan triangles.
10. Inflate tires to 50 lbs.
11. Lay an oil dry mat under the power plant to catch any drips.

Derek,

Ok, here goes...
It could be a lot of things that cause the problem you described. Basically
it could be poor valve seats (not the most likley) or bad timing, unbalanced
carbs,idle mixture settings,debris in the bowl (which will block a
passage),possibly an ignition problem,carb linkage not synchronized,+++
others.

My point is this may not be a cut and dry problem. I am not trying to make
this seem like an impossible task, but it may get frustrating (especially if
you shy around carbs).
My suggestion here is to start with the simple stuff and move on from there.
A couple of questions: Did an event happen that caused these symptoms? How
many miles are on the car ? How many miles since valve lash adjust?

Things to start with: Check the plugs (are they fouled?)
I have found the most common reason for this is a bad plug. I know you said
that the motor runs good once you get going, but the idle on these setups is
fairly rich and will cause a plug to foul if it isn't up to par.

I'll be glad to give you ideas and help where I can.

Subject: batteries and corrosion

George Hussey gave some really good advice on 914 storage that could
also be used for any Porsche. But I would like to suggest a slight
modification to tip # 7.

"7. Remove the battery and eacid the area with battery cleaner or
baking soda and water."

By all means remove the battery. I would not advise people to use
baking soda to to deal with battery acid. While baking soda will
neuteralize the acid it will produce salts (not NaCl) but sulfates.
These salts could catalyze corrosion. I would suggest the best way to
deal with battery acid is to dilute it with tap water. First vaccume up
any white powder (lead sulfates). Use very damp old or inexpensive
sponge. This process basically involves many rinses/dry cycles.  This
process will dilute the acid residue and dissolve and dilute residual
amounts of salts as well. Do the wiring harness battery connections as
well. Throw the sponge/rags you use away. Make sure the entire area is
very dry. If you use baking soda you should do a multiple rinse cycle
anyway to remove the salts, so why not just dilute the acid away
without prodcuing salts? Also if the acid has reacted with the metal it
will produce iron sulfates which also should be rinsed away as well.

I follow this up with a liberal spraying of the entire battery area
with WD-40.  For longer storage a heavier lubricant or even an
anti-rust jelly could be used. The purpose of these  is to seal the
metal from oxygen and moisture.

I don't know what battery cleaner is... so perhaps its use avoids the
production of salts. If there is an acid spill, remeber the addition of
a base will generate heat so again the use of baking soda is
problematic. Companies that sell lab safety supplies make a product
that absorbs the acid to avoid this very problem... but I digress.

If you'r messing with the battery at all it would be a good idea to wear
safety glasses/goggles and wear gloves.

Will you please forgive me for not acknowledging each of you by name?

Stan's message(s) suggesting that we become the "Electronic Frontier Region" of

Oooops, I just discovered that I have two random thoughts lying around (yer too

of the dues, for Students.  Anybody care to discuss that?

Subject: 911 Test Drives...

This weekend I got a chance to test drive a couple more 911s.  Let the 
buyer beware if you are car shopping in the S.F.Bay area, or maybe CA in 
general.  I drove one car that was under water during the recent 
flooding, but surprisingly the dealer forgot to mention it!  The 
giveaway was the fact that one section of rear carpet was missing and 
the exposed pan had "algae" looking green crud growing on it.  I noticed 
missing carpet pieces on a couple other cars, and when I confronted the 
dealer, he admitted that his entire lot had been underwater....I can 
only guess how much "hidden" damage the car(s) had.  NO SALE!

On a better note, I drove an '88 Coupe that seemed nice.  (Different 
dealer)  It had those sport seats I like.  The interior was OK.  Some 
knobs were missing, and there was  white overspray on the trim pieces 
between the seats and on the door sills from when they re-colored the 
seats.  The pockets on the door panels were broken and pulled loose when 
you try to open the storage flap thingie.  (I've seen this on almost 
every 911 I've checked.  Is this a bad design?)  Exterior was a metallic 
blue with typical wax residue in all the cracks, various paint chips and 
scratches and a pretty big chunk of the front spoiler was missing, 
probably due to someone "surfing" it over a curb.  Dealer wants $28,000 
for it, I want a MUCH better car for that kind of money.  This weekend I 
drove 2 cars, the '88 coupe just described, and an '87 Cabriolet 
"Amphibio-mobile"

(Blaspehmous comments follow)

Let me say first that I love the 911 and I have since my High School 
days.  I'm thrilled to finally be shopping for one, but the test drives 
did not give me the rush I was expecting.  The car rides really well.  
It feels SOLID over bumps and irregularities, and the quality of 
construction is obvious...no complaints there.  The mechanics and 
dealers have told me: "It pulls hard up to 4000, and from 4000 on up it 
will scare you!"  I felt a solid shove in the back, but not the sense of 
immediacy I had imagined would be there.  The revs just didn't climb 
very fast.  Each gear felt equally capable of adding velocity, and the 
engine felt flexible just not as sweet as I had imagined.  I tried to 
blame my lack of expertise with 911s for the poor performance...but my 
test simply involved flooring the pedal in second gear...no real skill 
required.

(End of blasphemy)

I'm not going to let these first few experiences deter me.  I'm going to 
keep driving and familiarizing myself with the car, and hopefully will 
find some explanation for why I felt this way.  Maybe I got a bad car. 
Maybe I need a turbo to feel what I'm expecting, maybe I need a lighter 
early 70's version...who knows?  (Gosh, if only T*d was here... <extreme 
sarcasm alert>) 

I'd be interested to hear any comments on this "emotionally disturbing" 
topic.  BTW if you're curious which dealership was selling the Aqua-Cars 
E-Mail me directly...

This shop Elaborate Enterprises 203-355-5225 in CT (Mike or Bill)
blasted my 914 inside/outside and upside down with a plastic media
that did not damage the underlying metal, but did remove ALL paint/bondo/
dirt etc, it is really cool to see a 914 in naked metal, I fought a 
temptation to clear coat it!!  After blasting we painted the car with 
por-15 and the proper base/color coats and added a clear.
The point is that these cars are getting old and it is really difficult to
do a repaint well without removing the old finish.  this procedure was
pretty reasonable at $650 for blasting, compared to chemical or acid
dipping.  just thought i'd pass along the experience.

Subject: what do w/ 944 valve/hyd lifter click?

Dear P-philes;

Let's discuss yet another 944'ism.

I have an '84. 70k miles and running great.

When I drive parallel to a solid wall (like brick)
(i.e. a wall that reflects high % of sound)  I hear a
valve sounding clicking.  If I just heard the noise
without knowing the car had hyd lifters, I would 
instantly say,  "OH - I know that sound, you need to 
adjust the valves".  

With the hood up and head inside, I hear the noise but
I doesn't seem THAT bad.  

1) Is this "common".
2) Is there anything to do about it?

The FORD dealer told me how to adjust the hyd lifters of
my ford bronco II w/ V6, and that quieted it down
quite a bit.  Is there a siimilar procedure for
P water pumper?

Hi, Andre.
 
I don't know much about RSs except the sordid details of the injection pump
(I have drawings for every single part inside the RS pump, from when I
worked at Bosch) and the fact that I want one. I also want Claudia Schiffer,
but I'm more likely to get an RS someday. Cheaper to maintain too, and you
can't insure Significant Others against theft.
 
Anyway, many of the answers to your questions can be found in a
hyperexpensive book entitled "Carrera RS" by Gruber and Konradsheim,
available in German and English. Motorbooks in USA sells the English for
$300, but realistically it can be found for less than that. I am not aware
of a French edition, but it may exist. Is there a French automotive book
store? (I only know of one such store, in Strasbourg). They can probably
help you. If not, you can try contacting the authors at TAG Verlag GmbH,
Postfach 911, A-1020, Wien ("Vienna" en Anglais). Fax (Austria) 0222/2143953
 
The book is hardbound, in a slipcase, 26 x 30 cm, 256 pages, all color,
numbered editions of 3000. The ISBN number in my English edition is
3-9500179-1-7.
 
Everyone who owns a genuine RS must have this book. For the rest of us, it's
very desirable in spite of the price.

Roberto Rabe writes that
>The fuel gauge reports the wrong level of fuel
and

>'accessory' position
 
I don't know specifics about the fuel sender location, but I think I can
help on the oil pressure.
 
Yesterday I rigged up my 356 to read oil pressure on the fuel level gauge.
In the process of fiddling with the system, calibrating the sender against
the gauge and such, I found among other things that if the sender is
disconnected from the gauge (no input to gauge) then the needle pegs at 5
bar (or whatever). Check your wiring, then check your sender.
 
I don't know what the 924 sender looks like. The VDO sender I got for the
356 has two posts, one marked WK and one marked G (presumably German for
"Warnkontakt" und "Geber"; warning [light] contact and 'giver,' the pressure
sender.) The sender is merely a potentiometer, a device whose resistance
goes up as pressure goes up. If you have an ohmmeter, check the resistance
of the pressure sender (one lead on terminal of sender, other lead to
ground). Start the engine, check resistance again. It should be much higher
with oil pressure on the sender. In my case, the resistance was as follows:
 
pressure (bar)         resistance (ohms)
0                           7
1                          51
2                          84
3                         117
4                         147
5                         177
 
If the sender seems to be acting normally, check the wiring from the sender
to the gauge for breaks/disconnections.
 
It's possible your problems are related, somewhere in the dashboard
electrical stuff.

Re the soon to be founded PCA/EFR, I propose that if voting rights are
deemed necessary (why? what would we vote on? throwing out T*ds?) members have
voting rights regardless of whether EFR is their primary or secondary region.
I see no stigma in having EFR as a secondary region, since we're all basically
equal at the keyboard, regardless of geographic location etc.
 
Also I don't see anybody other than Stan capable of leading the group
(President), unless at some point the technical aspect is passed to somebody
else (the physical equipment/software etc. needed to run all this). So
"voting" for a "president" becomes sort of a moot point.
 
PCA should be happy to support the founding of this new region, as it means
new members and new revenue. They may have to modify their rule about
requiring members to own a Porsche, but don't most people on the list have
one anyway? This wouldn't cut too many people out if enforced.

Subject: Porsche model numbers

There was some discussion last week about Porsche model designations and
project numbers.
 
The upcoming book, "Porsche 911 -- Forever Young" by Tobias Aichele has the
following explanation of the 901 number:
 
"In the meantime, the new Porsche was named 901. This designation appears
in writing for the first time on May 17, 1962. Initially, the T8 designation
was still added in parentheses. The renaming did not mean that this car's
design carried project number 901 in the sequence of all projects which the
Porsche design bureau had taken on since its founding on April 25, 1931. The
longest-serving Porsche employee, Karl Rabe, administrator of the project
numbers, was far too unsystematic for that and the story is somewhat more
complicated. At the beginning of the 1960s, a merging of the Porsche and
Volkswagen organizations was envisioned. To that end, the computer in the
spare parts department at Wolfsburg searched for unassigned numbers so that
no complications would arise after the fusion. The computer spit out "901"
as a suitable combination of numbers, so the new car received that
designation. Even today, the designation of all new Porsche car models
begins with a 9."

Cherie and Philes,

As one of the European minority on the list, I must say 
that I am less keen than most on the affilation of the list to
PCA.

In an ideal world I would like to see Porschephiles expressed as a 
Cyber Porsche Club, with it's own contacts with the factory and it's 
own contacts the other Porsche Clubs which are restricted by geography. 
Perhaps we might want to have links with PCA or PCGB or whatever, but 
I'm not sure that we should be subsiderary to them.

I wonder if Porschephiles is a long-term threat to some of the functions 
of the PCA (or PCGB for that matter) after all we have the best, fastest, 
real-time, diagnosis, support, engineering expertise, vendors, etc etc, 
only an email away.

This makes many earth-bound club publications slightly redundant in some 
senses. For technical Porsche matters, the list is starting 
to become *the* source.

Also, due to the wisdom of our benign despot, The Listmeister, we don't have 
the kind of political struggles the PCGB wastes so much time and money on.

Do we want to be regulated by the PCA rulebook (if such a thing exists),
or do we wnat to cut our own groove on the infobahn?

I am all for the creation of virtual Porschephile lebensraum by putting 
together a hardware and software infrastructure to support it, and I am very 
happy to contribute. I am against affiliation by geographical region, when
we are are associated by the net and not the vagaries of geography.

One question, did you spray por-15 on? Did you have any problems with what
seems like dust in the paint?

The reason I ask is that I have had two samples of their black paint and
both times I used them (I brushed them on), I end up with a surface that
looked like I hadn't tack clothed it! This doesn't seem to be a problem

BTW: Did you wet sand it after you were done prior to top coating it? This

Hi, pat,

No adjustment is available for the hydraulic lifters on your 944.

On the other hand, it is probably not the lifters that is causing the noise.
On my 83 944, for example, the solenoids in the fuel injectors clatter a bit,
not extremely noisy, but they are louder than the rest of the engine at idle.

If you still believe that the hydraulic lifters are the problem, you have
three courses of action:

1) Replace all the lifters with new ones.
2) Try a heavier weight oil (e.g. 20W50)
3) Burn the car for the insurance... <g>

Of course, you could trade the car for a Bronco with adjustable hydraulic
lifters... <another g>

I am not certain that becoming a seperate region is the right way to go

of any frequency and if we did, we would be treading on PCA's existing

We need to add value to the existing infrastructure.

Maybe we need to be a "for fee " service to PCA, POC, PCNA. It would
obviously have to be pitched correctly to them to achieve this

They would fund the network hardware and recurring expenses, we would provide
an electronic forum for the membership(s) (as we do today), and we could add
Email and electronic distribution services for the funding organizations,
Documentation could also be made available online plus maybe an "ask the

Subject: RE: Battery State of Charge

Pat Garvey asked how to check the state of charge in sealed lead acid 
batteries.



You can check the state of charge in a sealed lead acid battery by very 
accurately measuring it's open circuit voltage.  First, disconnect the 
battery charger.  Disconnect the negative battery cable if the battery is 
still in the car.  This will let the battery voltage assume open circuit 
voltage after a short time (wait an hour to be safe).  With an accurate 
digital volt meter, measure the battery voltage.  Use the following table 
to find the state of charge for a 12 volt battery (6 volt battery would 
be half these values):



100% charged                12.66

75% charged                  12.45

50% charged                  12.24

25% charged                  12.03 

0% charged                    11.82



These values are valid for a battery at 25 degrees Celsius.  For a 
battery at 0 degrees Celsius, reduce the table values by .03 volts ( i.e. 
12.63 is 100% charged for a battery at 0 degrees Celsius).



I hope this helps you to keep your batteries in good shape thru the 
storage period.

What I do to find TDC for each cylinder:

Put a lightbulb across the points like you were going to static-time
the engine.  Remove the distributor can, and turn the ignition on.

I put the back end up on jack-stands, and block one of the wheels to
keep it from turning.  With the car in 4th gear, I can then turn the
other wheel, and watch for the light to come on.

If you are turning the motor the right way, the light should come on

I don't believe that it is likely they'll change the rule about ownership. 
 But that doesn't mean folks that don't have a Porsche (yet) can't sub to 
Porschephiles.  Perhaps they can just pay what dual membership would cost,

     A late 50's TestaRossa owner had bought his car in the 60's (in pieces)
 for $4700. In the late 80's with a value of $1-2 million he still raced
 the car in Vintage events, even once sliding into the guardrail. "I have
 to remind myself its just a $4700 car," he quipped. Super-rare Ferraris
 (Barchettas, 250LM, the GTOs) are frequently driven, raced and even sometimes
 wrecked. But they never die.
     Since all the really valuable Ferraris were built by hand (dies ?
 Stampings ? no, just a hammer and a piece of sheet metal) ANY of the early
 Ferraris can be made from scratch. Ferraristi have an obsession with serial
 numbers, as long as they can track the ownership they are still outrageously
 valuable.
     Ferrari -Frames- have been rumored to sell for $100k. "Re-bodys"
 are common in the Ferrari world. Ferraris that were supposedly burned and
 buried have later been hunted and dug up like so much buried treasure.
    There was some outfit in northern Italy that -was- making forgeries of
 vintage Ferraris and selling them as authentic. Since engines are available
 (there were enough not-so-valuable Ferraris made along the really expensive
 ones that not All cars are rebuilt) and the rest can be made from scratch
 (or is repro'd) they apparently sold quite a few cars (cars that sell from
 $50-300k each) before getting shut down.
                        
  Where does this leave 912E vin #1 ? Probably hopelessly smashed, with
 few parts worth anything. Rarity doesn't really have that much to do
 with car value (really !), that the '76 912E had no race history or stand out
 it in any historical, technical, or aesthetic way it would take one really
 generous guy to rebuild that car....

        Aah, the E-region rears its head again.  Last time, I
believe that the idea was stillborn.  For some reason, it sounds
like a much better idea this time through!
        However, what about the well-known PCA "exclusivity"
thing?  I think that this forum should be open to those who do
not have Porsches (yet--we'll convert you all!).  I also would
not like to see people who do not wish to pay dues excluded.  Is
there any way to assure that non-members will still be allowed
to participate?  Note:  If this *does* go through, I will be a
Dual with the E-Region!  I am *not* trying to get out of paying,
I think of it more as a free-will/coersion issue.
        Another concern is that, if we do go the e-region route,
our "benevolent dictatorship" would become a democracy.  We may
all want Stan to be the President of the Region, but that will
eventually (10 years?) change.  And the powers of Region Presi-

effectively owns the list.  I'm not sure that I care for that.

Hi,

Just a quick question regarding tires. I need a set of 205/60/15   for my '73
911. Since I live in the US (no Autobahn speeds) and I'm not planning on
doing many drivers' Eds, I've decided to get H rated tires. They are also
much cheaper. Would a good H rated tire using todays' technology be better
than a decent V rated tire such a Pirelli P600?

I have heard good thing about the Yokahama A509 and Bridgestone RE71, what
about the Continental CH 90?  I don't want to save  $150-200  only to realize
afterwards that I made a big mistake. Any advice or experience would be
appreciated. Also, cold weather is unimportant as I live in Miami.

If owning a Porsche is the only roadblock thrown up I'd be surprised. 
However, unless the rules specifically say how much of a Porsche you have
to own maybe someone will permit others to buy shares in a title they have
lying around for $1 or 2.  After all, many of us ALMOST owned a piece of

blasted my 914 inside/outside and upside down with a plastic media

temptation to clear coat it!!  After blasting we painted the car with 
por-15 and the proper base/color coats and added a clear.
The point is that these cars are getting old and it is really difficult to
do a repaint well without removing the old finish.  this procedure was
pretty reasonable at $650 for blasting, compared to chemical or acid
dipping.  just thought i'd pass along the experience.

That's exactly what I had done to my '76 914 project. I considered dipping the car but the hoses in the longitudinals would have disintigrated and would have been a pain to replace not to mention the seams will drip the stripping chemical for a long time. It's amazing how the car looks when entirely to the metal. The POR-15 on the usual trouble spots was next followed by the epoxy primer, etc. Advice to potential POR-15 users; great stuff but don't get it on your skin, I think a tatoo would come off easier! Also, I had the suspension powder coated and it turned out great.

Subject: Porsche Storage

I would like to make few additions to the excellent recommendations by W.C.
Hutton and George Hussey.  

1.  An alternative to steam cleaning is pressure washing.  This tends to be
less abusive to the paint and rubber parts.  It will remove the collected
road salts and grime and tends to remove less paint.  Once these areas are
cleaned, a coat of wax will help protect against rust. You don't have to hand
wax the underside or engine compartment, a product like Sonax Hard Wax Spray
will apply an even coating of wax on these areas.  It doesn't chalk or leave
white residue.  This is also a great product for wheels.

2. An excellent battery cleaner is Wurth Battery Cleaner & Leak Detector.  It
neutralizes the acids and dissolves the salts so that they may be washed
away.  Once the battery compartment is clean, an excellent protective coating
is Wurth Rust Guard.  This may be brushed or sprayed on and forms a rock hard
coating that is almost totally impervious.  They used to make it in a clear
that did not need to be painted, but now is only available in black.  This
may be painted to match.  Make sure that all drain holes are not clogged.
 When the battery is reinstalled, spray the Battery Cleaner on the posts
after they are connected.  It sprays on yellow and turns pink if there is an
acid leak.

3. The exterior of the car should be given a coat of your favorite wax prior
to storage.  The interior leather should receive a treatment of a quality
leather treatment.  All vinyl areas should also be treated with a quality
vinyl care product .  A product that contains significant amount of silicone
may not be that beneficial to rubber or vinyl and may prove to be
detrimental.

4. The wheels should be thoroughly clean of brake dust residue as this
residue will turn acid and etch the wheels.  A coating of spray wax or
petroleum jelly after washing will help protect the wheels.

5.  All rubber areas (including the tires, gaskets, hoses) should have a
coating of a quality rubber treatment to protect against ozone damage.  Again
avoid silicone as it can dissolve the protective waxes in the rubber and
allow ozone degradation.

6. A last point on any storage is to protect you car against the little furry
creatures.  They love to make nests in the insulation and nibble on the
wiring.  Omni bags are one way to close down the rodent condo association.

If there are any questions, please contact me.

After thinking about this I'm inclined to agree with you.  After all, most
who want to are already members of PCA.  This list supplements PCA (or
PCGB) proper, as do a lot of other Porsche things;  "Excellence" magazine,
the various Registries, vintage racing, etc.  However, I'm sure if they
try to impose too many restrictions Stan will think long and hard before
trying to affiliate. 

Does Porsche A.G. have a coordinator for all of the Porsche clubs 
worldwide, like BMW A.G. does?  If so how about affiliating directly?

is closest to a regular 951 VIN but has an extra number, "6", before the

On a different note, I'm in digest mode so I just heard about Stan's

to buy another even better P-Car the next time.  A few months after Arin

[Text item: Text_1]
     Hi Andre:
     
     I have a 73 RS and the Carrera RS book.  Both are great!  I purchased 
     the book from Automobilia in San Francisco for $200. The car was 
     slightly more expensive.
     
     For your T to RS conversion, I recommend going with the conversion to 
     the touring version.  This will be the easiest, least expensive, and 
     most representative of the RS's built (around 80 - 90% were touring, 
     10 - 15% were sport and intended for racing, 50 or so were RSR's, and 
     the first few were stripped homologation versions).
     
     The touring version comes with the 911 S interior, including Recaro 
     cloth and leather sports seats (typically), so your interior changes 
     should be minimal.
     
     Other key features of the touring version (besides the engine which 
     you already have):
     
     Front spoiler:  usually the fiberglass version with the rubber strip, 
     but could come with the S steel spoiler.  Aftermarket versions of the 
     spoiler are available from several sources listed in Pano, our Porsche 
     Club of America magazine. I have seen originals from places like 
     Stoddard, but prices are around $1,000 or more.
     
     Rear bumpers:  Came standard as metal, could be ordered with the 
     fiberglass one-piece if desired.  Again, aftermarket fiberglass rear 
     bumpers are available.  The fiberglass really looks good.
     
     Fender flares:  RS rear flares are wider to accomodate the 7" rear 
     wheels.  These flares are probably available factory of aftermarket.  
     Front fenders are standard, and use 6" wheels.
     
     Gas tank:  The gas tank is extra large (85 liters?) and plastic.  On 
     models with air conditioning (believe it or not, some RS's, including 
     mine, have factor a/c) the extra blower up front necessitated the use 
     of the steel tank.  I have seen used plastic gas tanks advertised for 
     $400 to $800, but they don't become available often.  Don't know if 
     they're available from the factory anymore.
     
     Suspension:  Bilstein shocks (green), an aluminum front crossmember, 
     and mostly S equipment were standard.  On mine, the rear 'banana' arm 
     appears to have some extra support welded to the flange that attaches 
     to the hub area.
     
     Graphics:  You probably already know this part.  The stickers are 
     widely available as repros, with black the appropriate choice for any 
     car that isn't Grand Prix white.
     
     Transmission:  First versions had an oil cooling line, later serial 
     numbers didn't.  I'm not sure where the change occurred.  I believe 
     they all had a limited slip differential, but I'm not positive.  This 
     is listed as an option in the Carrera RS book.
     
     I'm no RS expert; there are probably some other changes that I haven't 
     detailed here.
     
     Please note also that there were many changes during the model run.  
     For instance, during the production run the speedometer was changed 
     from 250 km/hr to 300 km/hr, sheet metal changed thickness, and the 
     suspension was modified somewhat.  What you got depended on when your 
     car was built, and every RS out there is most likely unique.
     
     Also, many customers ordered special things, so some have rollbars, 
     some have the racing type hood and decklid rubber releases, some have 
     different mirrors...  Anyway, you get the idea.  The Carrera RS book 
     is your best source for this, and also includes some great photos.
     
     Let me know if you'd like any more info.

The Blizzaks that we've had DO seem extremely soft and squishy to the touch... Curiously so. But, again, I imagine they wear out awfully damn fast - and 
I just can't believe that their tread pattern, with narrow spaces between blocks, would work as well as Nokia's big-space unidirectional pattern. I'd love to

Regarding those who don't yet own a Porsche, I think Stan some months ago
outlined the work-around:  buy a share in someone else's, and thus become
part owner.  Maybe we could use the VIN from one of the virtual 914-6's in
Stan's desk, or someone else with a donor chassis on blocks in a garage
could offer shares in it for a nominal fee.  In this sense, it's a shame we
DIDN'T all end up 1/800th owners of Stan's lamented 914; would have solved

onto the idea of getting into the parade. (Mine was the really noisy [heat

Hi everybody,

The 915 tranny for the track car is sitting in my garage 

waiting to be filled with gear lube and bolted to the
engine.  Finally...  Anyway, I've called around to find out if
one of the oil companies in UT carry $wepco, but no luck.  So, it
looks like it'll cost me $30/gallon + shipping + hazerdous material
surcharge = probably $40/gallon before I see it!  Hell, I can get
top-of-the-line synthetic for $25/gallon (and grinding gears to go
with it...).  


So finally, my question(s):
Is Swepco 201 REALLY worth it?  

I want to do the right thing since $40 < $1200, but is this stuff really 

the ticket or is it just a case of $wepco-mania?
Isn't Valvoline GL5 90W going to do just as well?  Or should I just
buy a couple of cases of $wepco and have it drop-shipped so I can
make a fortune re-selling it on the gear lube futures market?  


Thanks,

Hey Folks,

I've been interested in getting a Slant Nose,Turbo-look (since I can't
afford the real thing), Cabrio for quite some time now.  Reading all about
how the water-pumpers aren't as good of an investment as the air
counterparts.  Plus the dropping of the 928/968 line has pushed my desires
to the air cooled Porsches.  Being that the air cooled ones are more
desireable I want one too. 

My question is would it be more economical to start with a Targa and make
it a Cabrio?  How about a coupe as opposed to the targa or cabrio, which
would be a wise choice.

Subject: Another 2c on the PCA E.R. region.

From reading the rather voluminous amount of mail generated, 
I thought I'd throw out my observations on the whole scene...

Obviously, the subscribers to Porschephiles feel the urge to 
belong to an official online group. That's basically already 
here, the only additions being perhaps "boutique" stuff... 
Shirts, etcetera. Plus we don't want to exclude non-Porsche 
owners from the list.

Obviously, the non-P-car owners can still read Porschephiles in 
any incarnation that I could see - after all, are we going to go to 
every subscriber's house and verify that they're not lying about 
owning one? However, if we're forming an online club, perhaps 
something can be working out with PCA (and, perhaps, Porsche 
AG, as well as Porsche clubs in other parts of the world) to 
become the official headquarters. Obviously, enough people are 
willing to donate the money that we might be able to get our 
own Site... Porsche.com? Perhaps if we could prove to PCA, 
Porsche AG, et al that it won't cost them anything, and will be 
simply good PR at little if any effort on their part... Surely 
there's gotta be some Porsche employees who are on the Net 
and are willing to donate a little bit of time to such a project.

Well, I think I'm doing a bit of rambling, but I think our first 
priority would be to band together, form an official group, and 
see if that can become either an PCA Region, or perhaps an 
all-new type of PCA support base. The only problem is, if we're 
mentioned in Panorama, the already busy P-philes list might 
explode, and perhaps would need to be switched in the future to 
specialized lists - Porschephiles914, Porschephiles911, etc.

Well, those are just some random foodstuffs for thought. 
Whatever happens, count me in. I'd be proud to stick a 
Porschephiles decal on my 914. (Perhaps we should leave a 
blank spot, or provide a matching decal, to include our own Net 
address?)

Subject: '87 Carrera


After encouragement from my wife to look for a latter '80s Porsche,
I found an '87 which seems to fit what I'm looking for.  After
talking to the owner on the phone, here are some of the highlights
that I know about it so far:

   - '87 Carrera coupe with sunroof.

   - 50K miles.

   - Partial leather interior.

   - Original paint.

   - Last major service at about 43K miles.

   - Only major repairs since new has been to replace an AC hose and
     replace the lateral stabilizer shock(?).

   - Only put on about 5K miles in last 3 or 4 years.  Only service
     done in that time has been an oil change.

   - Has maintenance records.

The owner is asking $26K (firm) and I plan on looking at it over the
weekend.  And if things look okay, I'll have a mechanic look over it
more carefully.  In the meantime, I'd appreciate any advice I can get:
Does this seem to be a fair price?  What sort of things should I look
at when I go to see the car?  Is there anything specific to an '87 that
I should be aware of?

About the only thing that this car doesn't have that I would like
is front and rear spoilers.  How feasible is it to add these?  How
much would it cost?  Is it something that I could do myself?

And one last thing for now.  I may need to finance part of this car.
Can anyone recommend a place with good rates and good service?

Thanks...

Subject: EFR issues - my $0.015 (long)

Well, I guess everyone realizes there are *lots* of things to think about here.

Anyways... here are some comments about what others have said:

1. The International angle.

Well, I live in Canada, and the Porsche Club of Canada doesn't exist
anymore... it was absorbed into PCA (perhaps PCA should change their name...
mind you, everyone thinks we're placid Americans with health care and no
guns anyways... :) There is also a PCA region in Germany.

The appeal is great for a separate, international club (yes, there is a
Porsche Club co-ordinator, Ilse is her name, I think, at Porsche), but Stan
is in the U.S., and there are quite a few legal, tax-related, and insurance
advantages to piggy-backing onto PCA. I'm not saying those advantages
outweigh the disadvantages, but right now, Stan is under a certain amount of
risk running the list (an extremely small amount of risk, but the potential
is there). Setting up a separate entity may prove to be a *lot* more work
than convincing PCA National.

2. Peoples who don't own Porsches, or don't want to belong to PCA.

The "Porsche owners only" rule of PCA is one that I pretty sure is nearly
impossible to change. I wouldn't even try. Tied in with this is the
(unenforceable) PCA by-law that Region members have to belong to PCA, and
vice versa.

Note that there isn't any PCA by-law against non-members participating in,
and paying to participate in, *Regional* events. The only restriction (for
insurance reasons) is that the region must run the event. Non-members can
subscribe to region newsletters, so...

The point is the rules can be worked around. It *would* create "classes" of
people on the list, though... primarily in terms of voting vs. non-voting
people.

People have co-owned cars in PCA, but a vehicle existing just to get around
the rules is exactly the type of thing that would get PCA National's back
up. Ya gotta be quiet about these things <grin>.

3. List vs. Club

Right now, its Stan's list. Many people would like it to remain Stan's list.
Just as regional newsletter editors wield tremendous power, so will the
listmeister.

There should be more to the region than just the list (although, like a
regional newsletter, it'll be the "lifeblood" of the region).

Right now there's an ftp site and a Web site. There's also a PCA-editor's
list that runs thanks to Stan's assistance. Larry Wilson capably runs that
list. Someone mentioned they had a "talk" site accessible. What about an IRC
channel? If you've got a microphone and a sound card, you can even have
vocal conversations throught the Internet. Point being that there's *lots*
of other stuff that can be done in Cyberspace... e.g., WAIS indexing of the
archives would be really nice (and a LOT of work too), but there's tons of
possibilities besides just the list... Web services to other regions/clubs,
advertising, FAQ's...


Anyways, I'm sure Stan has given a lot of thought to all the issues, and he
thinks he's "come up with the *exactly* the right idea." I'm inclined to agree.


Enough blathering for now,
Craig.

electric sunroof on my 84' 944.  I have tried "944 Ecology", but with no 
luck. They recommended trying here, so here I ask, anyone know where I 
might find one? (BTW Saratoga is out of the 944 glass top business now, 
so I can't try them.)
Thanks for any help in advance.

Not much adjustment. If the roof comes down level with the rest of the roof,
then the mechanism is properly adjusted.  If the roof is still wiggling
after that, you may have some worn parts, namely the lifting arms or the
slots in the sunroof into which they fit.  A little inspection should help
you identify the parts which need to be replaced.

Yep, got one (part of a complete sunroof) for sale. give me a call and we

The tradename for such a beast is a Saratoga Top.  Not available anymore,
except used.  My 2 cents worth is that I don't like them. Too much glare on

but will take patience and perseverance...

Subject: .Battery mats in older 911s

As my 72 911T waits for spring in the garage..
I decided to do a preventative  upgrade in the front
dual battery boxes.  My battery boxes are presently
in excellent shape for some reason, no rust but my batteries
are emitting their vapors and bubbling the paint.  I treated
these areas with a dilute solution of baking soda, sanded and
applied rust blocker paint. I believe it was Martin who
posted an excellent procedure on taking care
of this area awhile back. 

The current, somewhat new, Interstate unsealed batteries are snug fits. 
 I bought two Battery Mats from Zims to install under these
batteries, with the ideal of placing a  trimmed piece across
each row of caps to further help control the acid fumes.
Short of it is, they do not fit.  Everything is too tight.  Dang!

My question is:
Has anybody install these Battery Mats in their earlier vintage
911?  An I wasting my time when there is a better alternative?
Is one approach is to move to a single, nonvented battery,
setup secured outside of the battery boxes? But hey won't a single
battery upset my car's balance? 8{)  (This would have
been  a T*d bait question)

This month's Pano does mention a Miata battery box adaptation but 
the 912 original setup did not look like my box situation. Thanks in
advance for your suggestions.

Subject: 944 oil leak


Hi 'philes!

Lazy person that I am, I have my mechanic do my oil changes.  Last Tuesday I 
had this done, and by the weekend I noticed 5 or 6 two to three inch oil 
spots on my driveway (!).  I figured, by now, my oil is probably pretty low 
so I checked it. It was still at the *TOP* mark on the dipstick.  Between 
the leakage and the normal amount of oil my car "eats" (about 1/4 quart 
every week), I would have expected it to be low.  My car has never had any 
leakage that managed to make it onto the driveway before.

So what I'm wondering, is if they severely overfilled my oil, could it have 
accelerated the seal failure this quickly? (I can't see exactly where it is 
leaking, it's dripping onto the gravel guard and running to the edge - my 
car is parked at an angle, it is towards the front of the engine though).  
Am I dreaming here that I expect them to at least split the labor with me 
for repairing it?  The seal may have already been leaking, but not enough to 
make spots on my driveway.

Take this as a lesson, change your own damn oil. :)

I don't suppose the '61 B on top of my monitor counts much with PCA, huh?
Still lurking. And looking.  However, I would like to be counted in on an 
EFR.

I think that a number of people have raised some interesting points.  I
agree with DaveD about the "benevolent dictatorship" we have here and the
possible futures.  Stan, how do you feel about "President for Life"? 
Something of a two-edged sword I'd expect...  Anyhow, it'd get my, uh,
vote. 

I've been a p-nut since I first read books by Jenkinson and Ludvigsen but
am still looking...  This makes me a little less interested in the PCA
aspect of this; serial numbers and all that.  I would much prefer, as a
number of folks have suggested this time and last, something that
transcends organizations like PCA.  Non-North-Americans would approve too
I suspect as a couple of people have pointed out. 

Perhaps if those without the requisite PCA #'s can't aid in EFR startup, 
we could provide for an EFR h/w fund?

What is the company's (PorscheAG) relationship with PCA?  Is there a 
mechanism through which we could form a more direct link?  Are there 
other examples of international bodies after which such an animal could be 
fashioned?

Or would PCA help set up an international group?  Are there clubs
elsewhere (than N.America) that would sign on to help?  Could this be done
such that established clubs feel like proud parents instead of an
Internet-ized OSI?  Is this all more work than we want it to become? 

Anyhow, I am quite happy to redirect my "buy back the 914" donation to
this endeavor no matter which way it goes and am also more than happy to
help out in other ways if possible.  I, as yet, have no vin other than
bottled, but am happy to put the 100$ towards a new frontier... It is a
small price to pay for snakes, chickens, oil, bearings and exploding fans.

Oh, and I'd like to table a motion for one Stanley P. Hanks to be elected

That's a lot of pricey iron. I have no idea of the values.

I know this is a little off the Porsche track, but you started it :-).

In the shop where my 914 currently resides there are:

a. a 30's vintage Dusenburg SJ duel cowel phaeton. A fairly rare piece.
    The owner was offered $4,000,000 for it and she turned it down. She is
now deceased and it is part of her estate.

b. a 1964 Ford GT40. One of only four on the planet.
    The owner of this one (the same guy who installed the V8 in my 914) was
offered $1.8 mil when it was only a                bare chassis, half a
body, and disassebnled engine. He's got it almost completely restored now
and estimates its value at $4.5 mil.

No bragging or pretension intended. They are not mine. I will never ride in
either of them. They just happen to occupy space near my vehicle.
I wonder what percentage of the really rare cars in the world are stuck
away in off the path establihments like this, rather than museums.

First, please put a signature with your email address somewhere in your 
messages, preferably at the bottom.  You can list your cars, wife, ex-wives, 
cats, farm animals that you are particularly fond of, children, etc.  There 
are many mail systems that strip out the headers and we can't tell who you 
are.

Second, lots of us don't know shit either.  I suspect the reason you only 
got a few answers to your chip question was that not too many folks may 
know.  Sorry.

My take on this list is that most folks are willing to help those of us who 
are ignorant.  I've thrown out questions and got absolutely NO response.  I 
asked one question and got about 10 reponses in 2 hours.  Depends on the 
question, time of day/week/month/year etc.

BTW, I don't buy that 'I'm too old' stuff.  My dad's a retired accountant 
and he's pretty sharp.  Kinda grumpy, but pretty smart.

Sorry we come across as a bunch of snobs.  It certainly isn't intentional as 
far as I've seen.  There are some pretty decent folks here.  Where else can 
you find a couple of hundred people who are willing to cough up $15-100+ for 
a fellow most have never met in person.  For some of us, that was grocery 
money.

That said, about your paint (I missed your first post):  if you have never 
painted before, or don't have someone who can show you (I'd never done it 
before, but have a buddy who paints and he guided me through painting a 
5-series BMW) I'd give serious thought to plunking down the $300 buck to 
have the hood re-shot.  Tell us where you live, and I bet you'll get some 
comments about paint shops in your area.  One thing most people aren't short 
on is opinions.

Now, is it true that if I roll my IRA into....... :)

In my experience, oil spots on the ground always look like more than
they actually are.  This is even more so with the thinner fluids
(brake and transmission).

There's also the heat factor, which would make the spots look large

No doubt there are those who know more than I do, but as I understand
it powder coating uses an electrolytic (electrostatic) process.  It's
thinner than paint and becomes more integral with the coated part.  At

I think you're refering to the 904 that was fire bombed in South Africa and 
almost completely destroyed. But the frame was there. I can't see how even 
an expert can take the VIN tags from a destroyed 916 for example install 
them on a 914-4 and say "That's the original car" (after making appropriate 
mods.)

I guess the guestion comes down to this: one can replicate the car around 
the VIN tag but it won't be the same, you won't have the car's "soul". By 
this I mean the original workmanship quirks etc. that made it worth $1Meg in 
the first place.

I would not want to pay a fortune for a car that was not built by the

Dear X400459,

Speaking for myself (The Count of Autobahnstrasse) I find that I will keep 
quite on any and all subjects that I have not had direct experience in. That 
means that I have little to add in 914, 944, 356, newer 911 discussions 
because I know my 69-912 inside and out and THATS IT!. You'll find that this

So far as I know, PCA requires the joiner to be an owner or co-owner
of a Porsche.  They probably don't check, however.  Also, co-owner
cuts a wide swath.  If you're leasing a new Porsche, your equity
percentage is pretty small.

My own region lets members who have sold their cars continue as
associate members, and in that capacity they can do everything but
serve as president or vice president.  As far as PCA National is

Basically, they want members.

I'm goming to presume that the chip is down to the bare metal for this
process.  First, get some items to help you with the job:

	small bit of primer, compatible with the paint on your car
	color matched paint
	A very sharp #2 pencil with unused eraser on the end
	two or three extra pencils with unused erasers
	double sided tape or contact cement (cc preferred)
	600 grit wet/dry sandpaper
	320 grit wet/dry sandpaper
	220 grit wet/dry sandpaper
	some organic cleaner (simple green works great)
	a couple of cotton tipped q-tips, paper shafts required
	optionally a magnifying glass
	spray cleaner (Aero Kroil is the best I've found) or rubbing alcohol
	empty shoe box bottom, cut to fit over area with chip.
	Polishing compund (not rubbing compound)
	cloth diaper if possible, or lint free terry cloth rag


Carefully clean the chipped area with the undiluted organic cleaner and
examine the edges of the chip to see if they are loose edges to the chip.
Probe the area carefully with the sharpened pencil point (the graphite point
is soft enough to not damage the paint edges, and will come off with the
alcohol or spray cleaner easily with out rubbing) to look for areas that are
lifting up.  Make mental notes if any areas exist, or if possible, remove
them.

Cut a small circle of 220 grit sandpaper and glue it to the eraser on the
pencil.  Attach some 320 grit sandpaper to another pencil, repeat with 600
you'll need both of these soon, so do them all together.  Use this to
carefully roughen up the edges of the chip and the exposed bare metal.  Use 
the spray cleaner to remove the dust particles.  The spray cleaners have a 
high rate of evaporation, so should not interfere with the paint.

Use the 320 to roughen up about a small area of paint outside the chip, about
3 or 4 millimeters should be enough.  Use the spray cleaner to remove the
dust.

Carefully pull _most_ of the cotton off one end of the swab.  Just a minor
bit is needed since you are using the paper shaft as well to apply paint.
Dip the prepared end into the primer about 5 mm and dab the paint into the
chip.  Start at the center to create a dome of paint and pull it out to the
edges.  If there were loose edges of paint, try to get the primer under them
as well as coating most of the roughened up paint.  Leave about 1 mm of
exposed roughened paint around the primer.  The coat should be very thin.
If the first drop didn't cover the chip completely, in the next step, dip the
swap deeper into the paint.  But don't over do it.  It is much better to have
too little paint in a layer than too much.  Probably another 3 mm is enough.
Allow 2 hours to dry (!).  You'll thank me later that you waited this long.
take the shoe box and make sure that it can easily cover the area you just
put paint on, trim it if needed to fit better.  I use my car cover to hold it
in place.  This keeps the dust out while the paint is drying.

Once the paint is dry, use 600 grit to roughen up the surface and reapply
another dallop of primer in the same manner.  Let it dry another 2 hours.

Once the paint is dry, use 600 grit to roughen up the surface if you can see
bare metal in the scratches, repeat the previous steps one more time.
Usually two coats is enough however.

This time apply the color paint in the same manner, dip the sheared swab
about 5mm into the paint, and place a drop in the center of the chip, then
pull it out to cover the chip entirely.  Spread out the paint to cover all
the area that is roughened up.  Don't worry if you go over the area, it will
be removed later.  This layer of paint should be very thin, perhaps not even
obscuring the scratches or some of the primer.  That's ok.  Cover it with
your shoebox, and let it dry for 2 hours.

Add another drop of paint and spread it out to cover the chip.  The secret to
this method is that you should never redip the swab when applying a layer of
paint.  If the chip is larger, dip the swab deeper into the paint this time,
but only a little bit.  Don't worry if the chip is not covered with paint
yet, follow the same method you did with the primer and each successive layer
adds a bit more paint to the initial drop, until the area covered is the
right size.  Again let this layer dry for at least 2 hours.

Repeat the spreading drop of paint, 2 hour drying time, a number of times.
The idea is to make the combined layers of paint ever so thicker than the
painted surface of your car.  I predict for a chip that is to bare metal, you
will need about 2 coats of primer and 8 to 10 coats of paint.  As always,
more layers won't hurt, it just takes a lot more time.  The 2 hours between
coats is imperiative.  DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP.

By now you should have a small blister of paint a fraction of a millimeter
thicker than the paint job on your car.  Let the last coat dry about a week
before doing the next step.  Really.

Wrap the diaper around your index finger and make sure the tip is covered.  
Use this to apply a small amount of polishing compound to the ex-chip, and
polish the area in small circular motions.  Use a clean area of diaper when
the diaper is paint colored.  Examine the blister of paint to see if it is
blended in to the correct layer yet.  Once it is, clean your car like normal.
Then wax it with a good hard wax of your choice.

Yes this is a labor intensive process, but when you consider how much money a
new paint job is going to cost, its pretty minor.  I have used this method
many time (unfortunantly) and you would be hard pressed to find the chips on
the front of my car, even though it's black lacquer, the worst offender for
chipping and showing blemishes.

Having just replaced the one in my project 914 as I rebuild the engine, I can
tell you what I learned in the process.

First make sure the new pilot bearing is installed at the correct depth.  On
the 914 the pilot bearing should be recessed 3.2mm from the clutch side.  I
noticed that this was about the same as the width of the felt washer which
follows the bearing installation, and I assume it helps the grease stay put.

I used LubroMoly Moly Grease.  My Verlobte said that moly grease has 
problems at high temps but the manual recommends a molybdenum disulfide grease.

You must remeber that most of us guys and gals here are working full

We're *workers* first, listmembers second!

Now that's cleared, I think you should be pretty happy with the
answers you got on the chip request. There is different opinions
whether chipping your car is bad or good. Depends on your
drivestyle. For myself I would never chip a car without considering
mechanical upgrades/refurbishments too. I think it's like going to a
healthclub excercising just one limb.(personal non-expert opinion!)

The least I would expect would be a performance exhaust system, maybe
some work to the 'air throttle/metering piece'(Norwegian translation)
then a hotter chip 'might' be felt.

Paint question,...well you just got a great answer from Miq M.

cheers,

Neil, just my $0.02, not a flame, but putting inferior tires on 
a 911 is not a quality solution. For the saving of $200 you are
having a major impact on the only place your 911 touches the ground.
Say your tires last a nominale 10000 miles, Then you are saving
(coincidentally!) $0.02 per mile. Is it really worth it to cripple your
911 to save that cash?

Those four contact points are where maximum quality is needed. Whether
you do autobahn speeds or not is immaterial, you also need to
consider how many g you are pulling in acceleration and deceleration,
what dry and wet performance characteristics you need, what sidewall
stiffness is required. You should buy the best possible tyres. I like 
Yokohama A008P, there are others that are at least as good if not better.
I think that it is a false economy to purchase inferior tires for a 911,
if you cut corners here it will show in the handling and safety
of the car.

Dear disgruntled:

Yep, you are right in your assessment of what it is that we are doing here.

The group that makes up Porschephiles is nothing more than several hundred
people with an interest in Porsches and access to the internet mailing
systems.  Each of those people pays in his own way for that access.

Now some of those very people are right this minute having a good day, and
some are having a bad day. (I'll tell you what, ask me a question when I am
having a bad day and I will give you a completely different answer than when
I am having a good day.).  Furthermore, some of those people who are having
a good day know the answer to your questions and some don't.

What I'm trying to say is that if you don't get a response the first time,
ask again, perhaps in a different way.

It could just be that the one guy who knows the answer to your question is
too busy at his real job to spend the time answering it again.

I guess the other thing to remember is that none of us is getting paid for
this (except Peter Albrecht, who has my dream job...) and that the
information that you see here is sometimes right and sometimes wrong, a lot
of opinion without fact, and occasionally information distilled from years
of experience and cogitation.

Don't give up on us.  Every one of us was a newbie to Porschephiles at the
beginning...

BTW, please feel free have me ask any questions that you think are
embarrassing on your behalf.  Think of me as the anon remailer...

Regarding performance chips in a 1985 911 Carrera:

Yes, they are out there. Yes they do provide some improvement in performance,
The bottom line is, though, if you do not have a turbocharger on your engine,
chipping the engine will provide modest results.  

On the other hand, it may be just what you want.

For my money, the best performance improvement you can make to your Porsche
is to attend PCA Driver Education events at tracks, so that you can learn 
how your car performs at the limits of what Porsche has designed into it.

Regarding paint chips:

Already answered by someone who obviously knows a lot more about paint than I

I have an inexpensive leakdown tester I bought about 25 years ago, and
I have always wondered if it reads the same for the same leakage as
other leakdown testers. I think it is fairly easy to get a 1st order
calibration by making a "calibrated leak" with a known size drilled hole.
Could we get anyone on the list to try some different hole sizes and
report the readings? An easy way is to put a brass pipe plug in the
end of a quick disconnect fitting, and drill the hole in the pipe plug.
If we could get someone with a "good" leakdown tester to do this,
like the Snap-On, and then also do it for the "cheap" one, we could
at least figure out if they both measured the same thing. Perhaps
the hole size which produces say 5% leakdown would be a good choice. 

BTW- the reason this is an issue is that leakdown testers measure
pressure drop across an internal orifice, analogous to voltage drop
agross a resistance to measure current. However, there doesn't seem
to be any standardization of the internal orifice.

Subject: new injectors

Hey all,

I just got a new set of injectors (yes, AND the O rings) for my 82 911SC.

I'm planning on slamming those puppies in there this weekend.  If my
Dad's got his gastester by now I'll also re-set the mixture.

Is there anything I should do to either the injectors or the car to
prepare these things or just pop them in ?

I plan on using vaseline on the O rings as a little lubricant so they
don't get damaged and they slip in/on OK....any comments ?

Haven't been to the Imports show so I can't comment about that, but if you
are willing to drive to that area, on April 22, is the largest porsche-only
swap meet in the US.  That is in Mechanicsburg, PA, at Ski Roundtop.  It
is not far from carlisle, and in fact on that same day is the carlisle
show for 'merican cars.  The Mechanicsburg swap meet is free for buyers,
and you don't have to be a PCA member.  I don't have the directions on
hand right this minute, but its in Panorama or you could email me back.

And oh yeah, I don't name my cars or body parts no matter how much fun
they are to use. :)

I guess some of the European car mags do snow tire comparisons yearly
(especially those from the snowy countries).  The only comparison I heard
of is from this guy who sold me the tires (talk about bias).  He said
Nokia has done some comparison of the Hakkas (or the NRWs, I don't 
remember exactly) with the Blizzaks and found them comparable.  But
the Hakkas and NRWs supposedly have 50K mile tire life.

Ref Steam cleaning / high pressure cleaning

Both are great if you want to sell the car or show it.

Both methods - especially steam - tend to remove essential lubes.

There are regular air safety warning about steam cleaning of aircraft, 
the problem is not so critical on cars, but whatever grease is removed by 
cleaning, must be replaced - especially throttle linkages, hand brakes

    Well, I was jus at Fifth Avenue Motorcars yesterday - It's in
Shadyside, outside of Pittsburgh, real near CMU!  guess they expect us
to stop by after daddy gives us our grad. present!  Anyway, they had the
usual Countach and Ferrari 308's (I don't really like either design) but
they did have two luscious cars in the showroom - a white Jag e-type
coupe and a big old Ferrari four-seater (early 400?) in red with a black
interior.  Very sexy!  The guy told me I could have the Ferrari for only
$85,000 - so send those donations today! ;)  They used to have a white
Miura, but alas that seems to have been sold :(
    There is also a place in North Oakland (right next to shadyside) on
the corner of Baum Blvd. and Melwood that seems to specialize in Alfas
and other old Italian metal.... haven't checked it out in a while,
though.

Well, not really, not if it causes complications (like you MUST have a
P-car, you MUST vote for democratically elected officials, etc). The whole
thing started as a fine way to get Stan some money for his efforts, to buy
new equipment etc. I don't think anybody feels a "need" to do anything, or
to belong to anything. If too many rules get imposed on this thing, nobody
will want to do it. I think Stan has a good grasp of what it will take;
nobody gets cut out, even foreign devils are made welcome <g>, etc. More so
than the rest of the lemming population, I think people on Internet are
more individualistic and not automatically "joiners." An example of
vestigial Hacker Ethic?
 
Only question is, who gets to design the official uniform? Gotta have a
uniform. It's very German, you know. I propose maroon coveralls (like
technicians at Weissach) but with gold epaulets, braid, and campaign ribbons
for slaloms, rallies, tech quizzes, concors, beer blasts... And one of those
nifty hats with a BIG visor. Summer uniform gets maroon coveralls cut off at
the knees. With knee-length socks and sandals.

My father-in-law (wow, that's the first time I've had to call him that!
Weird), who lives in Australia, sent me an article published in their
Financial Review (20 Jan. '95). Here goes:

"The "psychographics" of Porsche owners produce five unusual, and not
necessarily flattering, personal profiles, according to a report in Fortune
magazine detailing market research conducted by Porsche Cars North America.
The company recruited a team of anthropologists to find out who was buying
Porsches.

The five Porsche owning groups the anthropologists defined are Top Guns,
Elitists, Proud Patrons, Bon Vivants and Fantasisers.

Mr. Bartsch said Porsche Australia had no plans to go down the same route
in determining the characteristics of Porsche's growing list of local
owners. The company celebrated the end of 1994 after lifting sales by more
than 50 per cent, to 212 units against 140 sold in 1993."

Next to this article is a cartoon; One man is interviewing another - a desk
between the two. Interviewer to small, bald man: "We're doing a survey on
Porsche drivers: Are you (a) small, (b) bald, (c) old, (d) a jerk?"

An accompanying article mentions that Porsche Australia hopes to sell the
Boxter late in '96 for under Aus $100,00.00.

(to quote the FAQ) a feature. I have received better information and

I thought the general opinion on these devices was that they are
cash flow devices. As far as paint touch up is concerned I have had
reasonable luck using touchup paint then wet sanding the area, and retouching
it again. The object is to build up the chipped area to the original level
of the rest of the paint. Normaly takes 3 or 4 times to make it look
reasonable. Afterwards one uses compound and then polish/wax to bring
it up to it's original finish. The idea is to have a surface that the eye
doesen't catch. If you stare at your finished work, chances are that you

Subject: 911 2.7: install shuffe pins?


[Text item: Text_1]
     Hi P-groupies:
     
     I've seen the process of installing shuffle pins (aka 
     anti-shuffle pins or dowel pins) advertised.  I know almost 
     nothing about this.
     
     As I understand it, pins are installed around the crankshaft area 
     in one case half with corresponding holes in the other half.  
     This prevents the case halves from sliding or shuffling around 
     the crankshaft.  This process seems to require incredible 
     precision; if the pin/hole combo is off, the bearings will bind, 
     and if the holes are slightly oversized to ensure non-binding 
     then the pins really won't prevent shuffling.
     
     I am rebuilding a 911 2.7 and wondered when this process is 
     appropriate.  Is it really only used for very high revving race 
     applications?  My engine will be a standard RS with 7300 rpm 
     redline, probably making around 230 hp.  Car use will be street 
     and occasional track.
     
     Any thoughts would be appreciated.

A very mysterious problem I have had on and off for the past 2 years
of owning my 73 911 was randomly the tach would drop to zero and the
past redline, a misfiring about once/hour of operation and finally
last weekend in Reno, I started up the car drove it 2 minutes and
it shut off, would not start at all, but did turnover.

Well, the triple A guy comes out and fiddles with the points with
his screwdriver and the car starts!  I decided to wait till monday
before going back to San Francisco and went by Motor Classics in Reno
first thing Monday morning.  The mechanic there tells me that it
is very common in my car that carbon from the distributor gets into
the points and causes all of the above symptoms.  I put in a new
set of points, but the guy was very nice and even showed me how to
clean the points with a business card in case I get stuck out in
the woods...  Hope this helps you, but you might have another type
of distributore.

Subject:  914 Horn Help?

Hello all,

At some point, a previous owner had installed an aftermarket steering wheel on my 914.  It was
later replaced with the original.  Unfortunately, I am missing some pieces inside the steering
wheel for the horn contact.  If I remove the center section of the steering wheel, I see a hole at
the edge of the center hub that has the horn wire in it.  The wire is cut off flush with the hub.  There
is a stamped steel ring attached to the hub to which the center section clips.  This ring has a
hole in it which is aligned with the hole in the hub where the cut wire is.  Something is apparently
supposed to go in this hole and attach to the horn wire in order for the horn to work.
Does anyone know what piece(s) am I missing?

Thanks,

Subject: Valve clearance, help

 
Jerry Brady reports that he has zero valve clearance on #4 exhaust, even
with adjusting screw removed.
 
Probably the valve has pounded its way into the seat, so the stem sticks out
into the head a lot farther than it's supposed to and takes up all the
available adjustment space. I've seen this before. This is not good and
can't continue for long. Eventually the valve seat breaks into little
pieces, some go out the exhaust pipe, some don't...Replace/recondition that
head. A temporary solution, but not a good one, is to put HARDENED washers
under the rocker stands to space them out a bit. If you do a compression or
leakdown test, chances are that you won't even detect anything "wrong" with
that cylinder.
 
A good book to explain this sort of butchery is the "VW Repair for the
Compleat Idiot" book by John Muir. It's good for get-you-home or dead-broke
college student type repairs, but the only right way is to fix that head. If
the damage is limited to the seat, a good shop can probably press a new seat
in for you at reasonable cost.

Subject: Re: EF Region

My primary reason for supporting the concept of the EF Region is that I 
see it as a good way to help assure the longterm viability of 
Porschephiles.  Becoming a region of PCA does offer a few hoops, but we 
don't have to handle ourselves the way other regions do.  My suggestion 
is this.  Since PCA requires Porsche ownership, EF Region must therefore 
require Porsche ownership.  However, non-PCA members can and do attend 
PCA functions in some regions.  Our primary function is, of course, 
porschephiles.  

So...

Members of the EF Region must own Porsches, must pay dues, etc. 
Non-members are those who, for whatever reasons of their own, (starving
students, them damned ferrenners, non-P Car owners, etc) who still
participate in our one great perpetual event (Porschephiles).  In their
case, they pay a yearly fee, (just like a non-member still has to pay to
run the auto-x), which is (surprise) just like the region portion of the
annual dues.  Special rates for starving students and other deserving
contributors are common at autocrosses, etc, and could be applied here as
well. 

PCA should have no problem with this structure; all we're really doing is 
allowing non-members to participate in our one great perpetual 
event--Porschephiles.

some meetings of your region and you will find more help than you'll 
probably ever need.  In the Potomac region (D.C. area), we have 
designated experts on each Porsche series.  Enrolling in driver's ed is 
a good way to learn how to drive your new toy the way it should be 
driven and most regions also have regular tech sessions.  You've paid 
your money to belong to PCA, so you might as well put it to the best 
use. It's always amazed me that of the 1,400 members we have in our 
region, it is only the same 50-75 people who come to the meetings and 
the events.

Subject: PCA membership


Hi all,

To be a member of PCA it costs $36 (US) per annum. Regions are allowed
surcharges for special things like extra postage, etc.

You must also be an owner, part owner or leasse of a Porsche at time of 
application.

So...what does this mean?
Not a lot to those that own a car under the definition above. Just send 
your application or affiliation to PCA headquarters with EFR listed as
your region.

For those of you who don't own (but have a strong desire to) a Porsche
there is a simple solution. Be an affiliate with all priviledges of
EFR participation except those which require a national membership. I'm 
sure and easy way can be worked out. I think this availability is what 
this is all about. I would not like to see these participants excluded.

For international members, you are now an American as far as PCA is 
concerned. Your address is a little different, that's all. In this info 
world it is possible. 

The lady at Porsche AG is Ilse Naedle, I hope I spelled Frau Naedle 
correctly. She coordinates activites between the factory and the various 
Porsche clubs world-wide. A charming lady.

So far, I've seen a lot of positive ideas passed by, except by Mr. 
Disgruntled.

Hi,

With respect to your question regarding chips, the same damn question

Moreover, no one *owes* you an answer.  This list is a voluntary community,
no one gets paid, and a lot of us pay to participate.  If you want to get 
owed
an answer, go to a local dealer or shop, credit card in hand.

To answer the question, you will not get any meaningful power gains from
an '85 Carrera by changing the chip, unless you also change other things as

does and does not work.  If you are nice to me, I might dig 'em out.

It's basically impossible to change a 944's oil filter without making a

to get onto the P/S pump and other surrounding bits, and onto the
belly pan.

Best solution is to drop the pan, clean it with a degreaser such as
Simple Green, and wipe down what you can of the P/S pump, etc.

Yes, it is a common noise.

It's not a hyd lifter, and there is no way to
"adjust" the hyd lifters like there is in some
american iron.

The fuel injector solenoids make a click noise.
Use a good injector cleaner at every oil change.

An exhaust leak from one cylinder can cause
a similar sound.

I'm going to sell my '71 911T and would like your advice on how much to
advertise it for.   This car looks good with it's stainless steel roll bar,
chrome parts, and targa top.  Still debating, as I have been for about two
years, whether to sell it or not. But I need the money for a down payment for
either a newer toy or a house to put one in.  I've owned it about 4 years, and
I think I'm the third owner.  I believe that the engine and transmission were
rebuilt before I bought it (don't remember and don't have records, but I do
have the previous owners phone number.)  I know I should have taken it in for a
pre-purchase inspection, but I was young and didn't have the wisdom of this
list then, plus the car was "me" when I saw it.
  
So here's the spec.'s:
'71 911 T Targa Red ( used to be a mustard color.)
Approximately 130k miles.
Runs great (I think so anyway).
Comfort option 14' Fuch's.
Koni's in back I think (yellow?)
Original Zenith carburetors.
Carburetors professionally tuned (I'd recommend "Nurburg Ring" in Redwood City
for older Porsche work.)
Some Bondo work on body.
Rust started on front pan (where battery acid must have run down?, I've seen
this before on a 912 I looked at and noticed it recently on my car.)
New parts since I've owned it:
Yokohama 388 205/70/HR14 (less than about 2,000 miles on them)
Bosch ignition coil.
Spark plug wires.
Permatune cd ignition unit.
Carburetor kits.
Bursch muffler.
Tune up parts.
E-brake boot.
Shifter plate, parts, coupling bushings.
Used front sway bar.
Special tools:
Unisyn carb adjuster.
Float level check tool.
Porsche spark plug socket.
Porsche engine spanner (to turn the engine with the pulley).
Jack.

That's about it.  Blue book for a car in "Good" condition was $9,200 last time
I checked.  So I feel that $8,500 is a good price for it.  I bought it for
$8,000 and invested many more dollars and hours into it since then that I'll
never recover, but it's been worth it.  So, what do you think it's worth and
are you interested?  Trades + $ for newer Porsche will be considered.

I noted with some surprise that Engine Builders Supply is now selling

Stan

The leak-down tester that EBS sells is not the conventional Pressure fed
type leak down tester.  It is a Vacuum based device, that is related to 
the Vacuum brake bleeder and vacuum device tester, with some different 
adapters.  I know this because I purchased one.  I have not used it yet,
but I'm sure it will give some engine health indication.  I am not sure if
it will give the same results from using a pressure fed device. The loading
on the rings would be different and not like that of normal operation.

From: CarcareSp@aol.com
Subject: Paint Chip Repair

A possible alternative to the last step in the detailed and excellent methods
to repair paint chips offered by Mr. Millman may be as follows.

1. The touchup paint has been applied to the surface and allowed to dry for
at least 1 week, and resembles a minute mound ( __o__ ){ this is exagerated}
on the flat plane of the existing paint.  The object is to remove the mound
and make the surface of the paint one continous flat plane.  Instead of
polishing compound on a diaper,  try a Meguiar 2000 grit Finesse Block.  The
Finesse Block offers the ability to gently remove only the high spot of the
repair.  Unlike sandpaper or polish on a rag, the five usable sides of the
block are flat and act like a "wood plane"  to remove only the elevated areas
of the repair.  The 2000 grit will not leave scratches.

2. Soak the Finesse Block in clean water for 24 hours prior to use.  Then
gently "plane" the high spot on the paint.  I prefer to "plane" in one
direction (usually back to front - drawing the block towards me).  If the
block dries out, rewet and continue use.  When the new and existing paints
are blended (smoothed to the flat plane) to your satisfaction, clean the area
with a quality car wash and then use a quality glaze to restore the high
gloss finish.  I prefer 3M Imperial Hand Glaze.  Don't use a machine on your
Porsche,  as they deserve to be caressed by hand.  Use the machine on your
Yugo. 

3.  When applying either a glaze or a wax,  apply to your soft cotton cloth
or applicator pad (don't squirt the stuff on the car) and work in one directio
n only.  Don't go around in circles like dear of dad .  Circles are many
times the cause of "swirl marks" .  A front to back / back to front motion
(the way the air flows over the car) will help minimize swirl marks or at
least make them less visible.  Buff out with a soft cotton cloth.  If it
looks good, wax with a quality hard wax and you are done.

4. Tip for applying wax.  If you are using a quality carnuba based wax, try
applying it with you fingers instead of a pad or cloth.  Hold your fingers
together and use your finger tips as an applicator pad.  The tactile feedback
from your fingers will tell you when the wax has been worked into the paint.
 If grit should lodge under your fingers, you will know immediately and not
grind it into the paint.  A pad will not allow this tactile feedback and
these devil grits become sandpaper.  A circular motion of the pad has made a
360 degree swirl mark.  All marks on paint are most visible at a 90 degree
viewing angle.  Thus the front to back marks are most visible from the sides,
whereas a circle stands out from any viewing angle.

I hope that the above may provide some additional food for thought on the
subject of chips.

Subject: Nate's 914 question du jour.

    Just wondering... I've seen various people mentioning that they have
a 911 "combination instrument" in their 914's, and I have also seen in
the Auto Atlanta catalog a mention of a factory oil temp. gauge that
fits in place of the brake warning light.  I would really like to have a
temp. gauge in my car as I have no idea what the condition of my
thermostat is.
    Here's my question - with either of these swaps, what kind of sender
would I have to use?  Are all p-car senders basically standard, or did
they change with year/model?  Which swap would you recommend?
    Also, just assuming on the wild chance I could find a set of 911
gauges, what would be required to make them work with my 914?  How would
I make the tach work with my 1.7? (or maybe a set of 912 gauges would
work?)
    Just pondering at random, wasting bandwidth like a madman,

Subject: Timing Marks


Alan-

An infallible way to find TDC , and also to recalibrate
the timing mark on your crankshaft pulley, is to remove 
the #1 spark plug.  Turn the engine (BY HAND) and in 
order of preference:

1) Mount a depth gauge in the spark plug hole and watch 
for TDC as you rotate the engine.

2) Hold a screwdriver vertically in the hole as you turn 
the engine and see when it reaches its apex.  Don't use a 
pencil or something that can break off if it gets jammed.  
(Don't ask me why I give you that last piece of advice.)

3) Look down the hole as you turn the engine and spot 
when the piston is at its peak.

The piston reaches TDC twice in each 4-cycle event.  
You'll want to know if you are at TDC on the compression 
stroke since that's where you want to set the timing.  
When you find one of the TDC's, see if the distributor 
rotor is pointing towards the terminal that goes to the 
spark plug in cylinder #1.  That's the right TDC.  Mark the 
pulley.  If it isn't, continue to turn the engine to the next 
TDC..  It will be the right one.

You can do this for each cylinder if you wish, or simply 
use a
protractor to locate the other pulley marks.

Does this help you?

Subject: Cleaning a neglected car

OK, I admit it. I take a sort of perverse pride in not washing my
car. As the year goes on, it accumulates more and more grime and melted
rubber (track events, donchya know). Once every couple of months, I give
it a half hearted once over with a bucket of soapy water and a sponge,
but that really just takes away the surface grime.  The melted tires and
more stubborn stains are undeterred and unaffected.

About once a year, I get the urge to really clean the car.  Get rid of
the grime; get rid of the melted rubber. Buff it with some McGuires
pre-wax cleaner and give it a good coat of wax.  The problem is that in
order to get the stubborn stains and tire marks, I seem to have to
resort to strong solvents (like gasoline or undiluted Simple Green)
and/or abrasives (rubbing/polishing compounds) and lots of elbow grease.
I suspect that none of this is good for my paint.

I'd really like to find a "better" / "easier" way.  Is there one? (I
hope the answer isn't "don't let it get so bad...").

back to the original FI. Thanks to all who responded. The consensus was 
that it all depends on the cam duration and lift. If it is too radical
it will never be streetable under the original FI.

Well, I have obtained more specifics on the engine. It has:

Weber 44IDF carb
Euro P&C, still 2.0 liter, but compression is 10:1 (!!??)
matched and ported, balanced
cam is a "Norris 242X powerband 3500-5500"

I'm not familiar with this cam. Is anyone familiar with it?
Any comments on whether this would ever run with the stock FI?

I have found a better way. Buy a roll of aluminum roof flashing (which,
BTW, is right up there with duct tape, bailing wire and chewing gum as
a universal fix-it material). It is about 0.010" thick, and easy to cut
with sissors, bend with your fingers, etc. Cut a piece about a foot
long and perhaps 6-8" wide, then cut and bend it until it forms a nice
cup under the lower edge of the filter, and forms a trough which carries
the oil which leaks from the filter when you loosen it out past the
edge of the belly pan. Put your oil drain pan under the end of the
trough. You may need to try more than once to get something which
stays in place as you loosen the filter, doesn't leak from the sides,
etc., but it is not that hard, and the stuff is cheap enough to try
several times. Mine doesn't leak a drop when I remove the filter this
way.

Then do the same thing for all of your other cars where the *%$# designer
mounted the oil filter in an inaccessible space, drippy side down.
Each car will require a unique design, but a roll of aluminum will
make a whole bunch of troughs.

I am sorry that you feel this way. However, before flaming the list

yourself *WHY* you didn't get an immediate amswer to your questions:
 - Nobody knows the answer
 -The question may have been answered 15 times last week, and the week

 -You posted the question on a low traffic day. If the sun is out, or a great

I recently asked a question about parking brake adjustment on turbo bodies

responded...

This list is not the *ONLY* source of information.

I assume that you have Panorama and some technical books on your Porsche such
as the Hayes manual, Upfixin-Der-Porsche etc.. Cars are not difficult to work
on, but a ton of different skills are required: Bodywork, painting,
upholstery, electrics, engine, mechanicals etc...A lot can be learned by
doing it. Unfortunately, there is nobody on this list who can change you into
an experienced painter. It takes reading, looking, imitating, mistakes,
trying, and trying before the basic skills are mastered. So be not surprised
if you get little response to basic skill questions. 

Again, I am truly sorry that you feel disappointed in your expectations of
the list. I look at the list more as an extended circle of friends with a
common interest. We are from diverse backgrounds, and all add a little bit.
There is often great trust between members when parts are swapped. Commonly,
I have either sent parts before receiving payment, or sent money upfront. It
has been an emotional support structure whenever a friend cried for help,
something I have yet to see happening on any other Internet special interest
group. I believe that the strong hand of the Listmeister has given this list
a closer, familial feel than most other mailers. Rather than "snobbish", most
people here are as down to earth as it gets (Gold chains, open shirt, cool

Enjoy you Porsche and lighten up !

Subject: Re: Nate's 914 question du jour.

    Just wondering... I've seen various people mentioning that they have
a 911 "combination instrument" in their 914's, and I have also seen in
the Auto Atlanta catalog a mention of a factory oil temp. gauge that
fits in place of the brake warning light.  I would really like to have a
temp. gauge in my car as I have no idea what the condition of my
thermostat is.
    Here's my question - with either of these swaps, what kind of sender
would I have to use?  Are all p-car senders basically standard, or did
they change with year/model?  Which swap would you recommend?
    Also, just assuming on the wild chance I could find a set of 911
gauges, what would be required to make them work with my 914?  How would
I make the tach work with my 1.7? (or maybe a set of 912 gauges would
work?)
    Just pondering at random, wasting bandwidth like a madman,

There are a couple of answers to the instrument question.  First, Later
914s had a temp gauge where the old and large parking brake light were, the
light is now like the oil pressure light.  I don't think this was an option,
but just available on later models.  You will have to do some re-wiring - minor.
I should also mention that the face-style of these instruments can be slighty
different as well.

As far as the 911 cluster, I thing what is being referred to is the combination
Oil temp and pressure instrument.  This fits where the 914 gas gauge cluster
is.  The problem is that will not provide a gas gauge for you.  You will have
mount a separate gas gauge, probably near center dash (console area).  These 
are available from Automobile Atlanta.  Make sure that you get the correct one
for the year 914 as the senders are different in the early years.  

As far as the senders.  Well, you want to make sure that the sender matches the
gauge movement.  If you remove the gauge movement from the cluster, you can see
small hand written numbers which are the temperature calibration numbers.  
Choose your sender based on these.  The oil pressure sender will be a VDO part
for the model year 911 the cluster came from.  There are two styles available.
One has just the pressure transducer and the other has both the transducer and
the idiot light switch.  

Have fun

I would suggest shiny black jackboots, but just for Porschephiles, the foot

    Just reminded me... anyone recommend a good speedo shop?  My car's
orig. speedo is in a plastic baggie (looks like maybe parts missing?  I
know the needle is bent to hell) and the previous owner installed a 160
MPH speedo that does not match the other gauges.  Could I trust it to N.
Hollywood Speedo (in the FAQ and all the mag's)?  How much is my 160 MPH
speedo worth? (i.e. could I conceivably trade it in for fixing the
original one?)  The extra capability is kinda useless, as I doubt that
little 1.7 could go over 120 even with a Pittsburgh tailwind...

This is OK to do *after* you have broken the filter free, ie, got it

then have to figure out a way to get the car to your mechanic

Actually it's a fuel deatomizer recovery device.  The idea is that the
WSC car comes up behind the ferraris and collects all the unburnt fuel
coming out of the exhaust.  This cuts down on pit-stops for refueling
by nearly 6%.

Since it's limited to ferraris because of optimal exhaust height
collection, it's only usually functional for the first half of the
race.

I have some for sale for the PCA racing.  Available in fiberglass for
$300 or carbon fibre for $625.  Mine have a goosenech adjustable for

Subject: Oils-Again!


Text item: Text_1

After my last posting I did some research on what is used on the motors which 
generate my paycheck, up to 110,000 lb thrust,yea its the correct number of 
zeros. Basic oil spec allows dino and synthetic BUT oils are approved by brand 
and type, just because it meets basic spec doesn't cut the mustard. Main problem
as you have probably guessed is coking due to heat soak after shut down. Most 
operators use Mobil Jet A, I believe Castrol has caused coking problems. On this
basis does any one have experience of Mobil 1 (I think thats the right one for 
us)?
Other things which might interest are that there is never an 'Oil Change' 
consumption at .05 th .2 gph causes refills to keep the oil fresh, closed 
systems get an oil change about every 600 hrs so the starter which has 500-700 
c.c. in it does 250,000 miles between oil changes! Oil filter gets changed any 
where between 500 and 15000 hours but does have an impending blockage indicator 
and SOAP smples (oil analysis) is frequent. Oil temperature run around 250F but 
can get to 350 on rare occasions. Under these conditions 15000 hrs between 
overhauls is common and 25000 is not unknown.
Thread to P-philes is that after all of this I am now leaning towards synthetic,
Mobil, for the 930 engine and probably for the tranny too.
Thanks for all of the public and direct responses.

    Thanks for the speedo. suggestions, the speedo is already apart,
though.  That's why I think maybe some little screws/etc have gotten
lost... nothing I couldn't handle if I had spare parts...  I'll see if
the actual mechanism works next time I'm home and go from there.  I
still need a new needle for it though, as the one in the baggie is
mangled possibly beyond straightening.  I'd like to have the stock one
in, if nothing else, because it seems to have been taken apart after the
vehicle was last registered, when I register it I want to have the
odometer reading the correct number so I don't get that silly "your
odometer has been tampered with" thing on the title.  blargh.
    Anyhoo, I'll have to see if there are any good shops around.  Can
anyone recommend anything in the Pittsburgh area?  Anyone going to a
swap meet soon?
Anyone have a busted '71 speedo laying around?  Enquiring minds want to know!

Don't be so hard on us.  There are hundreds of us (a thousand now?) and
many of us figure someone with better experience or more time or just
special interest in your specific query will give it the right attention.
Most of the time a simple, "This is my 2nd post on this matter...won't

help?" will take care of it.  I can assure you we do not discriminate against
new Porsche owners.

Congrats on your 85 Carrera.  I'm on my 4th Carrera now, and my sixth
911/912.  These cars are great fun and you'll love it.

Re performance chips: my first hand experience is they are a waste of money.
In my case the 89 911 came with an AutoThority chip.  And frankly I couldn't
be sure I noticed *any* difference.  Bruce Anderson, local 911 guru, did an
article for Excellence Magazine a couple years back.   His benchmarking
didn't show much, if any, performance improvement.  Sorry I don't have
details
at hand but I can look up the article and refer you to Excellence if you
like.

There have been some good postings about paint chip repairs over the last
couple of years.  Perhaps it would be worth your time checking the archives.
Or maybe you'll get some good advice from a kindly reader with the know-how.
Not my strength.

Hope that helps.  And go a little easier on us.  This group is terrific but
it
takes an investment of time just to weed through all the mail!

Peter,
I would agree that the price is a little high for an 87.  You should be
able to get a good 87 for $22-24k or so.  I recently sold a fairly high
mileage 88 factory turbo-look in *great shape* for $26.5k.  And a
near-perfect low mileage 89 silver anniv coupe for $28.5k.

But I am also convinced you should spend a little more for a very good
example.  A poorly maintained car will end up costing you more in the
long run; on these cars maintenance makes all the difference.  And
appearance, inside and out, is usually very telling.

There are no special trouble spots on these cars.  Cam towers, oil
return tubes sometimes leak.  The rear torsion bar brace is known
to fail (too many speed bumps?) but the updated bracket is much better.
Get it inspected by a pro and look for signs of collision.  Do the
leakdown test.  Check the service records carefully and look to see
whether the owner has cut corners.

I would shy away from adding spoilers and wings.  Originality matters
a lot to many people.  Find a different car is this is important.

87-89 are my favorite years.  I had very good luck with several
Carreras.

People seem to ask about typical prices for 911s.  I'll offer the 
following list to help:

Year  Median Price

1979  12,500
1980  15,025
1981  16,900
1982  17,900

1986  23,995
1987  24,500
1988  27,650
1989  29,900

I use "Median Price" to prevent extremely high or low asking prices from 
affecting the numbers.  This was generated from data I collected from 
P.M.L., a publication I would recommend if you're in the market for any 
Porsche.  This prices here are for coupes only...sorry that's the only 
one I did.  You can probably get a good enough idea from these numbers 
to extrapolate a cost for a Targa or Cabrio if that's what you're after.

I wondered about that too.....and then decided the easiest way
to get the gauges to work was to install a 911 engine.  :-)

If the info you have doesn't seem to work, call Getty Design.
Look for their ads in the usual places.  They sell (or did anyway) a
911 dashboard for your 914.  I'm sure not all of their customers
had 914-6's....so they might know about the required senders.

If you wanted all 911 gauges then you could buy their 911 dash.
Then you'll have 5 holes to fill.....oil pressure/temp, speedo, tach,
fuel/oil level, and a clock.  Oil level gauge won't do you much good,
but perhaps you could make a windshield washer fluid gauge out
of it....

It's me again.  After no one answered my post about wings and cooler running
911s (I know go whine on the newbie accountant's shoulder -- ya' bunch'a
Nazi Sheep/Snobs...).   I digress.

I might be close on this oscillating idle/surging problem.  I've replaced
the O2 sensor and it helped some, but I noticed some interesting parallel
problems: the cruise control slowly loses speed after being set, and the
brakes aren't as strong as our other '84's were (weak vacuum booster?).
 Since the car runs smooth for the first 30 seconds while the enrichening
mode is on, me thinks we have a vacuum leak.  Is this a pull 'n plug each
hose still it stops type of thing, or are there some "known offenders" I
should go after first (like: oh yeah, those early Carrera's always broke the
xyz vacuum hose...).

Next question:  How often are the valve chains and pressure fed tensioners
supposed to be replaced?  OK, I know that sounds like a "how high is up"
question, but I hear a sound that is not unlike a cement mixer with only
sand in it when the car is running, say 2K rpm on up.  I've heard that when
the tensioners fail it sounds like "gravel in a mixer", so am I paranoid or
am I hearing next-to-failure?  Again, the car has 118K miles on it.

When I did mine I was chasing a vacuum leak at the same time.  Even with
NEW o-rings I wasn't getting a satisfactory seal around the injectors.
I guess the proper fix would've been to track down the next larger size
o-ring.  Instead what I did was

1) clean and degrease injector
2) lube o-ring (I used Parker O-Lube)
3) install o-ring on injector from bottom
4) clean and degrease injector bore
5) press injector and o-ring into place; o-ring kind of "clicks"
   into its seat 
6) (this is the different part) flow self-levelling RTV onto top
   of o-ring (in the small recess there) to guarantee the seal.
   I used Dow 3140 which is a non-acidic aircraft/electronic sealant
   (and pri$ed accordingly) but any "self leveling" (flowable)
   hardware store silicone oughta do.  NOT bathtub caulk though!

Mine stayed sealed for 100k miles until my next injector replacement,
and the RTV was soft enough to pop out of the intake tube without much
hassle when the time came.

For checking/monitoring mixture an independent meter like the gastester
is invaluable but don't forget that on the '80-'83 SCs the CIS brain
(under the passenger seat) provides a diagnostic output that tells how
much lean/rich adjustment the brain is providing to the fuel
distributor.  The output is a pulse duty cycle calibrated so you can
read it with an ordinary dwell meter (the one you haven't touched since
you GOT your SC!).  I forget what pin the signal is on; it's in one of
the Bosch FI books or I can look it up if anyone's interested.  Anyway
this output is super handy for tracking down intake leaks ("probe" with
an unlit butane lighter), setting the static mixture, etc.; it is also
fun to watch when underway as you can see the brain compensate for
altitude changes, watch the warmup cycle, verify that the Wide Open
Throttle system is working (brain should go open loop), etc.  Another
interesting data point for gauge freaks like me.

Hmmm, when I lived in a cold place and drove a carbureted car these
symptoms were consistent with either 1) ice in a fuel line or 2) ice in
the venturi.  I presume these can both happen to a CIS car although 1)
the fuel pump's much stronger and the fuel goes in circles continuosly,
and 2) the venturi (read "throttle plate") is nowhere near as critical,
so I kind of doubt whether it would ice up.  Was the humidity high (fog,
snow, freezing rain, etc) at the time?

The traditional fix was Dry-Gas (alcohol, usually methanol, sometimes
ethanol).  On a CIS car this must be used with caution though!  Possibly
you could drain and dry your gas tank if you decide this is the problem?

I'm not in the club, so I don't know the details as to where it'd

Rochester...

In the Spring-Summer-Fall I see a 914 every day... Mine. :)  Other than 
that, I see about one every other month, I'd guess. Might see them more 
often now that I work at the Porsche dealer. I saw my first 914 (that I took 
note of) right down the road from me - a white one, with flares and 916 
nose/tail, and the Porsche lettering down the side. Later met the guy (via the 
local resto shop), and he's now working for the Padderick Bros, in... New 
Jersey? Wherever they're located. Supposedly he's working on a concours 
914 now...

>Oh well, it was just interesting seeing someone from Rochester posting
>to the list.  Oh yeah, I grew up in Webster, where are you from?  

In the sleepy town of Scottsville. Quiet, but a nice place to live - I can leave 
the roof off the 914 for as long as I want without worrying about thievery. :)

No, it was registered but did not show up.  There were an awful lot of very
fast and very tuned cars.  The lead dogs in the A class were two 935's
(one ex-John Paul, the other the Bayside car) and an (ex?) Kelly-Moss
SuperCup car.  The Champion car which Stuck et al drove at the 24 hrs
of Daytona was also on display.

The event was *very* well run, and I had a blast.  I did not compete; I 
drove
in the "touring" groups, which meant run groups all three days.  That was
a really nice touch, mixing in non-competitive driver/ing.  Other nice 
touches
included the framed participation trophy everyone took home, the dinners,
and that two regions co-sponsored the event.

I had a local instructor sit in my passenger seat, John M., a super nice
guy.  Sebring is a seventeen-turn circuit, apparently the oldest race
track in the country, and it is a kick.  Two turns, one at the end of the
runway and onto the front straight, the other at the end of that front
straight, rate an easy eleven on the pucker factor scale.

 The pricing I have found on new pumps for my 2.0 were in the $450-$550
range. The best was either Derentz or Westex (forget which). I found 1
better. Send your pump to Lukes&Shoreman. They'll rebuild it for you for

This'll be my first Imports at Carlise. I meant to go last year, but somehow

I only saw the one yellow 914 in the show, I THOUGHT... Perhaps you were 
out driving it during when I was there. I'll have to check my photos to see if I 
see it in the background. (BTW, I'm planning on putting my future photos

When I first started test driving 911s, I had some of the same feelings --
until I liked one enough to have a Porsche mechanic look it over.  Part of
the pre-purchase inspection involved a quick drive with the mechanic; he
drove.  He tooled around a little bit, listening for valve clatter and the
usual suspects.  We turned around and he started DRIVING.  We did a quick
130, followed by an impressive display of breaking and a tour of a nice
S-curve.  I knew I wasn't in my wife's Miata anymore.  Boy, that was fun.

 Now that I've owned that same car (78 911SC) for two years, I've come to
appreciate that the car doesn't come into its own until a few twists are
thrown at it.  It scoots along just fine in a straight line, but any
16-year-old kid of average hormonal balance in a five liter Mustang can

Subject: Annual Recruitment Message

As the PCA National Newsletter Committee chairman, I'm looking to expand
membership on our PCA Editors Mail List. Here's the deal:

If you are a PCA member and your region is NOT listed among the 36 regions
currently on the Editors List nor among the 9 regions who have been
contacted recently (see both lists below), please consider helping the
editor of your region's newsletter by getting on the PCA Editors Mail List.
If you ARE the editor, please contact me now.

The PCA Editors Mail List, also hosted by Stan Hanks, works like the
Associated Press and provides text, in the form of e-mail to PCA regional
editors. PCA regions are represented on the Editors List either by the
editor (if he/she has Internet access), or by another member of the region
having access who relays the text on disk to the editor. The message traffic
is held to a minimum by allowing only editors or relayers on the Editors
List. Each editor/relayer may also post to the Editors List those local
stories/tech tips that would be of general interest to the readers of other
region newsletters. 

I receive all PCNA press releases and post those to the Editors List along
with summaries of recent PCNA Technical and Campaign Bulletins. We have
other writers who produce stories (some very humorous) and tech tips for
posting. I also receive by snail-mail newsletters from about 60 PCA regions
and post OCR-ed text of tech tips and Porsche stories of general interest
from these newsletters.

About 70 stories/press releases/tech tips have been posted to the Editors
List since it began September 1, 1994. Many come from Porschephiles (with
the author's permission, of course). We now average about 15 postings per
month. It's all good stuff for regional newsletter readers.

You might want to become a "relayer" for your PCA region (if your editor
does not have Internet access) by converting the postings to text files and
giving them to your editor on disk. Please call your editor to see if your
region is interested in subscribing. If so, please send me a note to:   

larry_wilson@macnexus.org

These 36 regions are now represented on the PCA Editors List:
Alabama Region, California Central , Canada West Region, Carrera Region,
Central Wisconsin Region, Coastal Bend Region, Diablo Region, Green Mountain
Region, Gulf Coast Region, Heart o Dixie Region, Hudson Champlain Region,
Hudson Valley Region, Intermountain Region, Jersey Shore Region, Lincoln

Northern Ohio Region, Orange Coast Region, Polar Region, Potomac Region,
Rennsport Region, Riesentoter Region, Rocky Mountain Region, Sacramento
Valley Region, San Diego Region, San Joaquin Region, Silver Sage Region, So.

E-mail inquiries have been sent in the last several weeks to members of
these 9 regions:
Alpine Mountain Region, Arizona Region, Blue Ridge Region, Carolinas Region,
Connecticut Valley Region, Las Vegas Region, Oregon Region, Pacific
Northwest Region, and Suncoast Region.

Hi All,
I found the newest flyer from the State of Calif, Bureau of Automotive Repair,
regarding smog checks.  It comes with the DMV renewal form.

How To Get A Smog Check

Smog Check gives you the opportunity to help clean and protect our
state's fragile environment. Since the program began in 1984, it has
reduced harmful auto emissions by more than 17 percent, and is
continuing to work toward a 25 percent emissions reduction goal.

When you are due to have a Smog Check test (usually required every two
years), a notice will be printed on the vehicle registration renewal
form you receive from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

After you receive your notice:

Drive to the official Smog Check inspection station of your choice;
garage, service station or dealership displaying the familiar Smog
Check sign. Feel free to shop around for the best inspection and repair
prices. While the Bureau of Automotive Repair does not regulate
inspection fees, the Smog Check certificate is $7.

After completing a three-part test which includes a visual inspection,
a functional check, and a computerized tailpipe emissions measurement,
your technician will provide you with the test results. If your vehicle
passes all three parts of the inspection, you will be issued a Smog
Check certificate.

What if my vehicle fails?

NEW REGULATIONS GO INTO EFFECT 1/1/95
If after January 1, 1995, your vehicle fails Smog Check, new federal
law requires you to make necessary repairs to reduce your vehicle's
emissions to required levels.

If your vehicle is not under warranty, and you have spent more than
$450 for appropriate emissions-related repairs at a licensed Smog Check
repair facility, you may be eligible for a one-time waiver. Repair
waivers will NOT be issued for:

^ Vehicles with missing, modified or disconnected emissions control
equipment, regardless of the costs to make repairs;

^ Vehicles identified as "Gross Polluters"-vehicles which have much
higher emissions than properly maintained vehicles in their class;

^ Vehicles that obtained a repair waiver after 111195 in their most
recent biennial inspection or transfer of ownership. Two consecutive
repair waivers will not be issued after 111195.  Before a certificate
can be issued. warranty-covered defects must be corrected.
Manufacturers are required to provide the following warranties:

Model Year - Emission Control Warranty

1989 and older 5 years/50,000 miles 1990 and newer 3 years/50.000 miles
1990 an parts costing over $300 7 Year?/70,000 miles

Check the vehicle warranty for specific parts covered. For a free
warranty brochure, call 1-800-242-4450.

After receiving your Smog Check certificate, mail it, along with your
renewal registration forms and the required fee, to the DMV.

Which vehicles need Smog Checks?

1966 and newer vehicles powered by gasoline, liquid propane gas (LPG).
natural gas (LNG/CNG) and methanol are now required to have Smog Check
inspections every two years.

Heavy duty vehicles (8,501 pounds gross vehicle weight and over),
including commercial and recreational vehicles, are also included in
the program.

Are any vehicles exempt?

1965 and older vehicles, vehicles with two-cycle engines or engines
under 50 cubic inch displacement, and vehicles powered by diesel fuel
or electricity are exempt trom the program.

It you own such a vehicle, and your registration renewal form says
"Smog Check Required", you may need to make an appointment to take it
to a Referee station for verfication. For a Referee appointment call
toll free 1-800-622-7733.

What if I sell or buy a vehicle?

When a vehicle changes ownership, a Smog Check is usually required,
unless the vehicle has received a Smog Check certificate within 60 days
prior to the change of ownership. The SELLER must provide the buyer
with a Smog Check certiticate prior to the transfer of ownership.

Try R-M 900, "Pre-Kleano." (Don't laugh). It's used to remove silicone and
wax and stuff from cars before painting. A quart is about $6. I don't know
if it takes off rubber bunnies from your fenders or not. My second choice
would be mineral spirits (oil-base paint thinner). My third choice, if those
don't cut it, is to get brutal with the buffer. But then my daily driver has

P-philers,

I am a recent Porschephiler (6 weeks or so) and a semi-recent Porsche owner
and PCA member (~2 years).

I support the notion of merging Porschephiles with PCA in some way.  I am
hesitant to call it a "region", though.  The democracy (read bureaucracy) of
Region management is *NOT* something we want for Porschephiles, and is not
required.  I believe most of the publicly posted support for EFR agrees:
 most people want to retain Stan as the benevolent dictator.  

I think what we TRULY want (mainly because we can't hold Driver's Ed,
Concours, Monthly meetings, etc... on Porschephiles) is a non-discriminatory
way to reach everybody interested in Porsches providing:  

 - A facility for the proliferation of all the knowledge and information that
PCAers have

 - Promotion of all the activities offered by the current Regions.  These
activities can GREATLY enhance your enjoyment of your German metal.
 Participation in Region events helps each Region which, in turn, helps PCA
(which helps P-philes, read on!).

 - Provide stability and financial backing for Porschephiles.  Isn't money
what started the latest talk for an EFR, anyway?

Why not have "Porschephiles, the Internet address of the Porsche Club of
America.  All who own, love, or admire Porsches welcome."  Simply have
National PCA support Porschephiles financially.  I am sure Stan will let them
know what they need to charge us. :)  Let anyone join for a free trial time,
and then have them pay dues.  They won't be PCA members, just users of a PCA
"service(?)" or "partner".

To sum this up, my $.02 is that we stay away from calling ourselves a
"Region" and move for affiliation.  We will not alienate anyone and maybe we
could have/eat the proverbial cake...

At any rate, we offer our support for PCA affiliation and "Ether-Region"
status.

I've never had a problem with oil leaking when you remove the filter. It 
seems that the check valve inside holds it all in even when you hold the 
filter with the opening facing down. Of course you get a few drippings 
but nothing that cannot be wiped up by a rag.

If punching a hole is all that is required to let the oil drain out then,

a. Your filter doesn't have a check valve and all you've done is equalized 
   the pressure inside and outside the filter.
 
b. You've damaged the check valve which now allows for a. to occur.
 
Both would allow for a chance of having tiny shards of metal enter the 
engine...something I'd have reservations about.
 
BTW, I highly recommend the 'coil' type filter wrench for the 944 
(Automotion carries this). By the way it's designed, there is practically 
NO way you cannot remove the filter. The tighter you turn, the tighter it 
grips. Plus you practically need no additional clearance around the 
filter for manoeuvering.

I was unable to "officially" attend the Parade in Colorado Springs several 
years ago (I lived in Denver at the time) because of work.  I did drive down 
for the concours, and it was a blast!  It appeared to be open to anyone.  
Another good thing to do is hang around the official hotel.  A lot of really 
nice cars in the parking lot, and a lot of proud owners anxious to talk 
about them.  I think you're only excluded from participating in the 
"official" events if you don't register.  At least this was the case in 
Colorado Springs.

I think the EFR Region idea is interesting.
 
As far as owning/not owning/owning a part of a Porsche is concerned.  Does
it really matter?  If you do treat the EFR Region like a regular region,
then the only people who could pay dues are owners.  Like a regular
region, non-owners can participate in events, or attend meetings.  Now I
know that most people would not go to a PCA event without being invited,
unless you just happened to come across one.  As in, meetings are not
published to the general public, but Rally's and Autox's are out in the
public's eye.
 
With Porschephiles (or Porschephiles-request) being public knowledge, and
a public address we would have to have some provisions for non-owners who
find out about the list, and send email to join.  Like, "You cannot
register with the list unless you provide proof of Porsche Ownership".  It
sounds a little snobbish or stuck-up to me.  Besides On-Line services
like Compuserve or AOL, are there other lists that charge for services?
I would hate to have the list be stereotyped, don't flame me, we all know
what I am talking about.
 
I realize that most of the people, besides the newcomers looking for
purchase info, who post regularly are PCA members, does that mean we all
should be.  People join clubs and organizations for different reasons.
 
I was a member of a private sports car club for years before joining SCCA.
Being a underpaid college student I could not afford $45 or $50 for SCCA.
I eventually joined SCCA when I had the money, mostly for Autox, but over
the years I have worked Hillclimbs and Races.  After purchasing my 911, I
immediately joined PCA, this was before I joined Porschephiles.  I joined
PCA for the technical information (which Porschephiles provides more
timely and more opinions), I wanted Pano, and to do track events.
 
I wish I had joined Porschephiles before I purchased my car, but I thought
that there was no information I could use until I owned a car (boy, was I
ever wrong), and I did not know I could access Porschephiles from my
Compuserve account, so I waited until I had an Internet account (this
shows how little people know about how the Internet works, even people
like me who earn their living and support their Pcar habit from
computers).
 
I think Porschephiles is a great asset to owners and future owners.
Especially since most new Porsche owners are owners of used ones.  I would
hate to loose the mix that the list provides.  Last, but not least, I do
pledge $50 to the list for hardware/software support, if someone is still
counting.

Use Flashsessions to download all of your mail at once, and scroll thru it
offline.  All Mac versions of AOL have Flashsessions, and the new Windoze 2.0
versions have them.  I open the message at the bottom of the window of
messages first (last being oldest), then use the arrow keys to go thru them
till I'm done.  Then I delete in mass.  I save any I want to keep first to
text files by going to the file menu or by hitting Command-S on a Mac (assume
there are similiar keys in Windoze).  You can select all messages in the
meassge listing by clicking on the last (or first) message, scrolling to the
end, hold down the shift key (on a Mac; again assume there is a similiar way
in Windoze) and click on the first (or last) message, hit the "Delete"
button, click "ok" when the "are you sure message" comes up, and away they
go. And no, there is NO way to get rid of the "are you sure" message!

NO way of sorting mail on AOL, sorry! No key word or anything like it.

If you want the digest version instead of individual messages, send email to
"porschephiles-request@tta.com" and ask for it. Give Stan a couple of days to

I read and lurk, only occasionally address the list.  Love the knowledge and

No problem with financial contribution to keep listserve serving.  Big
problem with PCA region idea.  I already belong to the CVR region and have no
desire to make PCA membership anymore than it is.  The Club does many things
besides communicate:  Track events, concours, rallies, picnics, dinners and
other social gatherings, fund raising for charities, etc.  This list
communicates amoungst its "members" (splendidly at that) and does tech via
E-mail.  Yeah its a unique group, but I think it falls pretty short as a car
club "region".  I don't agree that it's a good match.
Many organizations have other entities within their umbrella structures --
special interest groups (SIGs) -- for example, or institutes or subunits of
the club.  Perhaps Pfiles should define such a new subunit ... I just can't
equate the participants to the region concept.
I love the idea of a cool-looking cyberspace pfilers window sticker for the
small rear window of my porsche.  I still have one from the now defunct 944
registry, which is still very-cool.  How about that ... the Porschephiles
cyberspace (Internet?) registry?
Ah well, the idea still needs developing I guess.

From past experience, walking around the hotel, autocross or concours is
not a problem, but getting into specific activities or the "Goodie" store
may is.  A "Parade" name badge is required for the Goodie store and some
other things during the week like the hospitality suites etc.  Though 
things may have changed since 1992.

We've all seen CHT (cylinder head temp.) gauges advertised in P-car

and indirect indication of CHT but I think it might be valuable to have a 
direct indication from each cylinder, or at least each head.

Each cylinder probably operates at a different temp. and an accurate reading 
would help in tuning and diagnosis.

Aircraft use this to help properly lean the mixture as well as to avoid 
shock cooling the power plant. (during a reduced power descent.)

Has anyone installed or used CHT guages in air cooled road machines with

Some points have been brought up by myself and others
and Stan has responded to some of them.

One point is that affiliating with the Porsche Club of America
seems to be in conflict with the international nature of the Internet
and this list. I think this is a pragmatic choice and Stan points out
the U.S. tax benefits of becoming a PCA region. If we send money
to Stan for whatever reason, he would have to declare it as taxable
income unless it was earmarked as bonafide club dues. Perhaps
at some point we could be given a charter directly by the Porsche
factory, but in the mean time it is expeditious to seek affiliation with
the PCA.

Second point is avoidance of club spawned bureaucracy. I propose
that our bylaws stipulate that whomever is maintaining the
computer equipment and the list be president. Hopefully this
would not contravene PCA rules. We (the founding members of the
EFR) will need to write a "creative" region charter and bylaws.

Lastly is the possibility of the exclusion of folks who don't own a
p-car. Well, there is no reason why list membership must equal
EFR membership. The club members would be a subset of the
general list membership and could perhaps have a few extra
privileges, like paying dues (towards equipment maintenance),
using the "goodie" store to buy t-shirts and the like, and if need
be, voting. PCA club members also receive Panorama, of course.
The porschephiles mailing list could be a "public service" that
the region provides, free of charge.

That'l be $0.02, please. ;-)

It would be a shame to deny non-owners of the obvious pleasure of staying on
this list.  Perhaps, we can designate someone's racer or 'crosser as the
Official EFR Racer, and non-owners can "own" a piece of this car for, say, a

I know, I know, its's a blatant and outrageous attempt to circumvent the

Has anyone asked Porsche (dealers/mechanics) how

Eventually I ended up stuffing old shop rags in around the base of
the filter before unscrewing it.  Most of the oil ended up on the
rags, which were then thrown out.  Some oil still made its way

Subject: Cylinder Head Temperature Gauges

I put one of my own design on a Berkeley engine some years ago.  That
was a 3-cylinder two-stroke which had no cooling fans at all.  It
was placed crosswise just behind the grille opening.  Two strokes are
sensitive to mixture (they commonly eat petrol and pistons) and it
was very helpful to the running of this little car.  I used only one
in spite of having 3 carbs and 3 separate cylinder heads.

Classic aircraft engines do not have altitude compensated carbs, but
have manual mixture control.  It is common to use exhaust gas temperature
to optimize the mixture.  Note that these tend to operate at steady
power for long periods.  Sometimes they are fitted with one gauge per
cylinder which let's one optimize mixture without the risk of leaning
out any cylinder too much.  Cylinder head gauges are generally intended
to detect warm-up and gross engine malfunction.  They react too slowly
to tune mixture.

On a Porsche, you probably couldn't get much useful information out of
more than two gauges, one for each cylinder.  That would tell if one
bank was hotter than the other (or if the sensors weren't matched).
Oil temperature is probably nearly as good.

Subject: Undisgruntled Porschephile

First, I must apologize formally to the group. While, initially you came
accross as snobs--I was wrong. I've received many useful hints, particularly
on paint in recent days.
  As an old dog, retired accountant, I don't have much tech knowhow to offer
the group. I do, however, have a number of old car stories I could share with
you folks, if this is proper for your forum. I was interested in cars in the
late fifties, early sixties. In 59, I bought and Austin Healy 3000 and had it
for about 3 years before selling it for furniture and marrage bliss. In those
days, the "big healys" were quite the car; able to compete with the Detroit
Iron of the time. 
  I had a buddy who bought a red Porsche 1500 356 (I think it was a 56). Keep
in mind that at that time I wasn't a Porsche owner. At any rate, that car
(the Porsche) wasn't very fast off the line but was excellent for autocrosses
and gymkannas (spelling?). Well, this guy traded his v8 55 chevy for the
Porsche. He was disappointed with the acceleration. One day, as we cruised
the city streets, he pulled up next to a bright yellow Renault Daulphine with
a Chicken Delight Sign painted all over it and a big CHICKEN HEAD on the
roof. Well this was his chance. He gunned the engine and popped the clutch
and the Chicken Delight car did the same. Well, he beat us--badly. Now this
guy (my buddy) became obsessed with the Chicken Delight car. As I recall, he
went out and got an Abarth Muffler system, had it tuned on a dynomometer, and
had other performance work done on his P car. Next, he found out where the
home base for the Chicken Delight car was (4th and Washington, Gary,
Indiana). We went down there and, sure enough, after about a half hour of
waiting, the Chicken Delight car showed up--same driver.Well we followed him,
after he picked up his orders to deliver. He was easy to follow, the chicken
head sort of stuck out in traffic. You know the end of the story--we caught
him at a light and he beat us soundly. After several addition unsuccessful
trys, we gave up trying to beat the Chicken car.

If you're interested in added sports car war stories by a driver (not
mechanically inclined) let me know. If this isn't the forem for such fond
memories, I'll understand.

Well I spent the last year looking for a good 911, but I changed my
mind in favor of a 930 once I had the chance to see one up close.
In New England, there weren't that many turbos available, but
I found that the pricing for 78-83 cars was generally in the range
of $ 22K - 30K depending on miles and condition. This is for real
930s, you can find lots of oddball aftermarket turbo-look or turbo
conversions for less. To learn more about my prospective purchase,
I had bought the books "The 911 performance Handbook", "Porsche 911
Turbo", and "The Used 911 story". When I found a european '82 930
with adjustable turbo boost and other performance goodies, I decided
to take the plunge. But I drove the car for 250 miles and had it
checked out by two mechanics. (Trouble is they gave me different
points of view.) Regarding maintenance, I have the schedules for both
the turbo and the regular 911, and there doesn't seem to be that much
difference in terms of the labor that is needed, but when I look at
the Automotion and Performance Products catalogs I find that a lot of
spare parts are significantly more expensive for the turbo. (E.g.
regular spark plugs are a couple of bucks, the turbo's platinum plugs
are around $19 each) Also, I should note that in the maintenance 
records of my car I found that the previous owner had spent over $7K 
rebuilding the engine at 39K miles. So you would be wise to do a lot
of research, but I found the "window shopping" to be lots of fun!

Nathan Hanson
1987 944S
==========================
Nathan, I have built a set of ramps out of wood. I think I used 3/4" wood.
I had originally made them to be able to get the 911 off the groun. I have
4. I measured the 911 clearance and worked around that. I have a 1/2' lip
in the front to prevent me from falling over :)

I can use them on the 944 also. I had to cut a bit off the lip to clear the
spoiler. So now I have L & R sides... Ususally use them in the front to work
on the engine...

I also use 6x6s by about 10" to get the whole car off the ground without tires.
Like when I did by brakes, FE work etc. I use a hydrolic jack and then place 
the 6x6s under the longitudinal beams in the front, enf by the suspension on
the rear. The 944 is so stiff that if I use 3 points, the 4th is on the air.

Also have a set of safety jacks. Do not get under the car unless it is well
secured. Also use wedges (2x4) to prevent car from rolling when on ramps.

YMMV. Hope this helps!

The short shift is definitely worthwhile for 70-72 914s after the linkage is

oil temperature never climbs much above midscale. Sustained high speeds on
I-5 up to San Francisco in the middle of summer (air temp 90-100 deg.)
doesn't cause problems either. 20 or 30 minute race track (not slalom!)
sessions don't even see it reach midscale. In anything less than summer
temperatures, like what we have now, it doesn't even get to 1/4 scale.
In my opinion, installing an oil cooler is more trouble than it's worth. You
have to hack holes in the fan shroud and find a place to put it and run oil
lines etc. If you are building an E/Prod race car, something with more than
130ish horsepower, yeah, you need this, but not for a street car with modern
motor oil.
 
My third 356 was found dead on the freeway. Some kid had bought it a week
before from an old guy, who got it from his son. Kid broke down because
throttle linkage broke (another one of those genius Weber conversion jobs).
I got him going again by tying the carbs half open with some string and
showing him how to drive with the ignition switch. He was going to Gary
Emory's Parts Obsolete in Costa Mesa, near my house, to try to sell the car,
so I offered to guide him there ("DON'T get behind me; watch the mirror for
my turn signals!") The car had some odd stuff on it -- kid said something
about the old man saying it was a lightweight but he didn't have time to
research it and just wanted out of it. That night, I called Germany and
confirmed it was indeed a lightweight with aluminum panels (engine
lid was obviously aluminum, with louvers like Carrera), price was right so I
wound up buying it. Now here's where the oil cooler comes in. Somebody had
mounted an oil cooler right in front of the fan shroud air inlet, and mounted a
full-flow oil filter. They were taking the heat out of the oil and putting it
right back into the cooling air. Pure genius. And the throttle linkage had
broken because the vertical rod from the transmission bellcrank was
bending over the hoses stuffed behind the shroud every time the gas pedal
moved. Even after it was fixed (the kid had somebody next to Gary's shop do
it before I bought it) the throttle would only open about halfway, with
about an inch of effective travel down near the floor. Typical Weber kludge,
I've seen more like this since then. Anyway, after I bought the car, I did a
title search and traced previous owners, right back to the original owners.
The old guy's son (this is now 4 owners ago) was in Kansas. I called there,
and talked at length. It turns out that most of the "improvements" were done
by him. He is a high school shop teacher. "Yep, I put dat dere orl cooler in.
It's what we do to keep Beetles alive in Kansas summers."
 
CHT (or better yet, EGT - exhaust gas) temperature gauge sounds like a good
idea but I've never fooled with one (on a car). Especially good idea for
air-cooled cars. The engine oil temp gauge would give only a rough indication
of a problem such as running too lean, it's really more of an outside air
temperature gauge! (Hot day outside, oil runs hot). And it sort of averages
all four cylinders, twice removed. Any serious problem will take time to show
up in the oil temp, and you'd have to know what the gauge would normally
read under those outside air temp and engine load conditions anyway.
 
Pegasus Auto Racing Supplies sells EGT probes and gauges. Call 414-782-0880
for exact prices and catalog. Single EGT gauge about $50, probe $40,
probe extension $10, four-position selector for reading four probes with one
gauge $30. So for a full rig on a 4-cyl. car you're looking at close to
$300.
 
You might try aircraft EGT gauges but I suspect they only work on 28 Volts,
and the probes might be bigger and restrict exhaust gas flow.

To All:
Kevin is right.  The WSC car did not show.  I don't know why.  Perhaps the
thought of having to compete against all that heavy iron turned them off.  Or
perhaps the fact that Martin Snow withdrew the 1972 911T "935 killer" cooled
their desire to participate.
More than likely the entry had come in before their withdrawl from Daytona
and just wasn't posted until the last minute.  I suspect their initial
thought was to use the Club Race as a "test and tune" session for the 12 Hour
coming up the middle of March.
It was a good event.  A few minor incidents in practice but 3 clean races
with about 50 cars in each race.
I will be happy to post the results as soon as I receive them (I had to leave
a bit early to catch a plane) if anyone is interested.
For those of you who were there,  I'm not normally that heavy handed, but it

nope.  most that I've used are self contained.  no external power except
for maybe a lighted dial.  they use thermocouples not rtd's so they

with about 1/2 of that inside the exhaust stack.  Usu about 1/8" dia.
if you put in more than one they must all be exactly the same distance

Powder coating is an electrostatic painting method. You strip, blast,
and etch the metal in question, then hang it in an electrostatic charge
field. You then apply paint in powder form (sort of just fogging it out of
a big nozzle) that is oppositely charged. It covers *everything*  -- no runs,
no missed spots. The piece is then heated in a blast furnace to melt
the powerder paint, leaving the metal very effectively enamaled.

Subject: Valve clearance, help

re Jerry Brady's no clearance on #4 exhaust --
 
If you take it apart, also check the length of the valves. Valves can
stretch before the head breaks off. Also check pushrod length. I can't
imagine these changing enough to matter but it's easy enough to do. Maybe
some unmatched part snuck in there?
 
Question is, if you have a sunk seat or stretched valve, why did it do that?
Probably running too lean on that cylinder, and/or detonating (but usually #3
gets hottest first, at least on Beetle/356/912 applications). #3, just so
we're using the same nomenclature, is on the flywheel end, not the pulley
end. (on 356/912 is driver side, toward front of car).
 
If you need to replace valves, definitely go with the sodium cooled ones. I
don't even know if non-sodium filled exhausts are available, but don't use
them if they are.
 
For cheap entertainment, you can dispose of junk sodium valves yourself.
The manual says to cut them in half and throw the pieces, from a long way
away, into a large vat of water. Wait until explosion dies down... I used to
know a guy who went to MIT, whose idea of a cheap thrill on a Saturday night
was to get a kilo of elemental sodium from the chemistry stockroom, go to a
bridge over the Charles River, open the container (it comes packed in
glycerine) and heave it as far as he could into the river.

is intended "for engines over 1,000 cu. in."  (and locomotives, I 
presume).

There is another one listed as an "Eastern brand" tester for $69.95.

The illustration and description indicates they hook up to shop air
and then to the spark plug hole.  It's got two gauges, with some 
kind of control knob on it.  Instuctions presumably furnished.

Fellow 912 owner Sean Steinman asked how to get the rear quarter interior
panels out.  Assuming a '69 uses the same mounts as a '67, here goes:  

The panels are held in place in three ways:  the TOP is held in place by the
interior trim piece that runs along the bottom of the rear quarter window, and,
depending on the year, the MIDDLE is held by the shoulder belt mount, and the
BOTTOM is held in place by a hidden, angled metal tab that slides into a slot
on the body along the face of the wheel-well bulge.  I suspect that tab is
what's giving you problems.  Once the obvious fastenings are removed, you need
to gently lift the panel straight UP about one inch to unhook the hidden tab. 
For reference, similar tabs hold the back interior panel (the one behind the
rear seats) in place.

Dennis,

Sorry to hear your 944 is hemmorhaging its most precious fluid on your driveway.
There is a lot to be said for changing your own oil, but we all know that
it's not always convenient.  
The first thing I'd do is check to make sure the filter is on tight.  I
usually change my own oil, but I had a similar experience with my 944 when I
took it to a local shop on my way out of town on vacation.  I must have made
the mechanic nervous when I hovered over everything he did.  The filter was
still a half turn loose when I left, and I left very similar spots.  The
ammount of oil escaping wasn't enough to affect the dipstick 
level either by the time I figured it out.
As far as the gaskets/seals go I've heard too much oil may do this BUT, it
seems to 
me it would take an awful lot of overfill.  If the mechanic did that, they
should blatently reimburse you 100% for damages.  If they lacked the
knowledge  to do the 
job right they should never have started.  An oil change on a 944 is no
different than any other car!

Well, I've got an '86 928S as well and had previously owned a '71
911T so I feel I can give a somewhat educated opinion.   As you
probably know, the 928 and 911 are two entirely different cars.
Yes, they're both fast and handle quite well, but they achieve
their performance from different angles.  The 911 is more of a
sports car than the 928 will ever be.  My 911 felt much more
'tossable' than my 928, and since I have the automatic I'm not
quite as involved when driving the 928 as when driving the 911.
Not to mention that the 928 has power everything.  I bought the
928 instead of the 911 because I could get more bang for the buck
in a 928, and the 928 has bigger back seats (for my 5yr old twin
daughters, they even pronounce Porsche correctly).  Why does the
911 have such staying power?  You tell me what car comes to mind
when you think of Porsche.  I'll be you see a 911, and I'd bet the
same goes for the general public (when was the last time you saw
a television ad for a 928?)  I'll also bet that in general the
maintanence is easier for a 911 than a 928, and that parts may be
a little cheaper as well (especially radiators and water pumps :-).

Do I enjoy my 928?  Absolutely.  What will my next Porsche be?

Ed McMahon).

Subject: Experience with POR-15?

I am doing some minor rust repairs, simply paint bubbles on the surface
mainly, and was wondering if anyone has experience with the POR (Paint Over
Rust) products - long term?  Does this product really work over time?  Is the
rust less likely to come back if you use it as a first step "primer" on the
bare metal.  Any pros or cons?  Does the paint adhere just as well over it?
(assuming you follow directions).  It's fairly expensive but if it works it's
a bargain at twice the price.

Subject: RE: Cylinder Head Temperature Gauges


Inasmuch as you are concerned about fuel mix, your best bet in the gauge
department would be an exhaust temp gauge.  It isn't particularly good at
fine tuning, but it would tend to show up severe problems.  With a way-lean
mix, exhaust temp would shoot up, for example.  A fat mix would run cool.

Of course, the high line approach to this problem is a wide-ranging lambda
sensor exhaust monitoring system.  They are available but are very
expensive.

A cylinder head temp sender might reveal basic problems with cooling the
engine, particularly an air cooled engine.  I don't have any experience with
cylinder head temp measurement.

On a street car, you have no need for either.  Porsche did their homework.

Subject: Replace those divots...

Pano had an article last year (or so) on concours preparation which
included a simple method of repairing stone chips.

After cleaning, fill the ding with touch-up paint.  This may take
several coats.  After drying, "sand" the new blob down to the level
of the original paint using a small wood block covered with a single
layer of cloth (T-shirt fabric works great) and moistened with
lacquer thinner.

This method is very easy and relatively safe.  The original baked on
finish is not affected by the thinner.  Also, with other methods of
sanding it is very easy to go to far.

This method works well for me.  Last fall I was first in my class
(alright, it was a small class) with my 80,000+ mile daily driver.
And these miles were accumulated in Houston - stone chip capital
of the world!  Argh, I left out 'concours at a local PCA event' in

Subject: Jacking/raising a 944

Gee-

I've been using a hydraulic floor jack to lift my 944 at the corners (in the points
shown for a floor jack in the Haynes book and owners manual), then using Jack stands
to support each corner as I move on to the next.  Takes a little while to do all 4
corners, but it seems to work alright.  I have also cheated on occasion by using the
jack (with a Griots Garage yellow plastic jack pad) to lift one entire side of the car
at the point where the factory jack inserts, the slipping jack stands under both 
floor jack points at once.

I also recently bought a small bottle jack, and I have been planning to try using 
it to lift the left side of the front end (again in the floor jack spot) while using
a floor jack to lift the other side of the front end (this because the car is in the 
garage for the winter, and there isn't room next to it to work the handle of the floor
jack on the left side).  Of course, I would then insert my jack stands before getting 
under.

Anyone care to comment on these procedures?  Are ramps (oak or not) better?  (Of 
course, you can't pull the wheels on a ramp).  Why would it be necessary to use 
a 6x6 when jacking the car?

BTW - I have noticed that if I only jack one corner, after I let it down that corner
seems to sit higher than the rest until I drive it, after which it seems to even out.
Is this normal behavior after the suspension has been fully extended?

Nate,
 Thank you for being my doorway to the p-guys and Stan. I was going to
update the list when I can speak (This has happend before). Well I looked
at FI parts prices abd discovered that I could get a cylinder head temp
sensor for 12 bucks. Some one mentioned to me that this could be it. I
called my X FI mechanic and he said no chance its working fine. I replaced
it any way (Talk about a tight spot and creative wrench attachments to get
to it!). Results are fantastic. The car runs when its cold at lowet than 4k
RPMs! The car doesn't stall lurch or stumble. It used to be I'd have to sit
for 10 min and let the car warm up at 4k RPMs now I get in start it tune
the radio wait to feel a little heat at my feet and off I go. The only
thing left is a slight hesitation that occers randamly. I can';t hear the
injectors fire at with ignition on engine off, so throttle switches are my
best guess and I be replacing them. Then I hope to have a completely normal
car and am no longer afarid of FI so screw going to the mechanic I'll
figure it out myself.
        Now the only thing is do I buy snow tirers for the thing. All this
snow in PA is a pain in the tail as the 914 is the only car I have.

I'm a veteran at making messes during oil changes, even on my old truck
which has lots of room. No matter what precautions I use (news papers
all over the garage and driveway) I will always find a way to dump the
oil and/or filter all over myself, the car, the garage, and then drag
the stuff into the house, its incredible. (after re-reading this it's
not as bad as it sounds).

However, to minimize oil leaking from the filter when removing it. I
first break the filter loose, use a plastic bag from the grocery store
and place over it. Keeping the bag up against the block, unscrew the
filter and let it fall into the bag. I don't know how it will work on a
944, but it may be worth a try.

hope this helps,

Subject: Re: 911 information general

> Why 2 valves, air cooled, etc?

        Someone once called the 911, "A bad idea taken to its logical
extreme, and then perfected."
        "Why" has a lot of different answers on a lot of different
levels.  First off is money.  The 911, ass-engined, air-cooled, two-
valve, and all the other "unique" features, sells.  Part of that is due
to Porsche's racing heritage--and 911 derivatives have been wildly
successful--probably more so than any other car ever designed.  Part
of that is undoubtedly due to the fact that the 911 is very different
from any other car currently made.  It is unique, and that appeals to
a lot of people.  Most of these differences give it "character".
("Character" seems to refer to things that detractors see as "bugs",
and afficionados see as "features".)
        Why aircooled?  Aircooled engines are (can be) lighter-weight
and simpler than their water-cooled counterparts.  Air-cooling has its
imitations, however.  One of which is that it is difficult to make four-
valve heads that last any reasonable amount of time.  Air-cooled en-
gines also tend to be louder than water-pumpers.  Water-pumpers gener-
ally run cooler than the air-heads, which can make for longer engine
life, and also lets you do more to the engine (in terms of mods, etc.).
        Aircooled is good.  At least to me.  I like the 911.

The short shift is definitely worthwhile for 70-72 914s after the linkage is

   This won't work in Texas; a car recovered by then sold by the insurance
company will print the mark "Water damaged" on a flood car (or "reconditioned"
for a wrecked car). If taken out of the state, then re-titled back in Texas 
the mark _isn't_ erased as a title search shows the history and the car stays
"marked," i.e. title laundring doesn't work. Of course, its completely up to 
 the donor state if it doesn't return to Texas. 

   Probably 90% or better of water damaged cars end up back on the road, there
 is -no- condition of car where Texas demands "scrapping" the car (there
 should be; burnt hulks of expensive cars can sell for thousands of dollars
 at auction, this is purely for the theft market where car identities are
 needed...That the price gets bid to say, $7000 for a worthless, burnt
 Mercedes is kind of scary since it means there is -competition- among thieves
 for the VIN/title....Insurance companies would be smart to privately scrap
 these cars instead of dumping them thru the salvage auctions, but whats it
 to them ??).
    One sure way to avoid getting burned is to ask for records for a car.
 You sort out guys who aren't obsessed with the maintenance of their cars
 and are sure to get only personal cars with proven care.

  At auction, flood cars can sell for nearly wholesale (there are no easy
 bargains in the car world). But flood cars can make good cars, and if fixed
 right the only damage is the stain you can't get off the title...

Subject: Clear Coat Paint Chip Repair

The question was asked if clear touchup should be used as a final coat to
repair chips on a clear coat paint.

There are two view points to this question.

1. The purist will say yes, the paint has a clear coat and thus, the repair
should also.  The process is the same as previously described, except the
clear coat is substitued for the last 2-3 coats or paint.  I do not have the
touch or the art of a painter.  I personally have not had that much luck with
the two process system.  One of my cars is Cyclemen Red (Black Cherry
Metalic) with a clear coat.  This color is more difficult to repair the any
other.  Black is a snap compared to this.  As this is a concour car, I tried
to be a purist.  Lacking the skills of a surgeon, instead of a Q-tip shaft, I
use the point of a round, undyed,  wood toothpick to apply the paint.  Dip
the point in to the paint to get a thin coating on the first 1-2 mm of the
toothpick.  If there is a blob on the end, gently scrape it back into the
bottle. Place the tip of the toothpick against the center of the chip and
allow capillary action to literly flow the paint into the depression of the
chip. Allow to dry 2 hours and repeat 8-12 times till the depression is
filled with paint and bulges slightly upward.   If I use anything larger than
a toothpick,  I wind up with a mess.  After many attempts, I finally gave up
the two step process.  This is my failing and not a slur on the system.
      

2. The practical world says no.  The touchup paint is different from the
original paint and is formulated only as a touchup paint.  Once it is applied
it should, according to the manufacturer, match well enough to be all but
invisible.  I have found this to be the case with the numerous repairs on the
many cars/colors, I have completed.  If you are using the original paint as a
touchup ( I have not done this with a clear coated car),  then my understandin
g is that you should use the clear as a topcoat.  The color coat of some
paints will many times be relatively dull in appearance.  These paints rely
on the clear coat to provide the "shine".  

Try one chip in an area that is not that visible.  If the process works, then
continue with the rest.  If not try the clear coat.  The idea is to develop
your technique on an area of the car that does not stand out. Then move into
the major playing fields.

I hope that the above has added a little more food for thought on chips.  (Or
chips as thought of food)

I put the VDO cylinder head temperature gauge in my '83 SC.  It gives a
useable reading but has several problems.  Problem 1 is that it is a
thermocouple type sensor *without* cold junction compensation which 
[cut to chase] means that what it really measures is the temp
*difference* between the air in the engine bay and the cylinder head.
Thus you're not measuring actual temperature, and must apply a mental
fudge factor based on a guess of ambient temperature, to get an
indication of how much fun your valve guides, head joint, and piston
crowns are having.  Problem 2 is minor; the gauge covers 100-650F
and my car is mostly 250-300F with occasional excursions to 200 and
350... so you're trying to read a 1/16" gauge division for all your
info.  Problem 3 is that I don't have any idea what constitutes "safe",
"warning", and "alarm" head temperatures, and the gauge comes with zero
supplemental info.  Perhaps some of you Lycoming floggers can provide
some input on this.

On the plus side it is a gauge of significant amusement *and* you can use
it to make life easier for your engine, though I suspect the engine can
handle anything you can dish out, CHT-wise.  In particular you can
notice how much less heat capacity high-altitude air has, leading to
indicated CHTs 50 degrees hotter at 6000 ft, and also you can note the
correlation between CHT and high-load, low-rpm situations such as
climbing a long hill in 5th.  And armed with this info, you can change
down a gear and watch the CHT drop from 350 to 300, or at least you can
if you're an anal-retentive gauge freak like me (like I said I doubt any
of this matters to the engine as much as, say, keeping your *oil* cool

Your trivia for the day (as my History teacher says)-- Was reading the 
2/13-19/95 issue of AUTOWEEK and came upon a P-car article on pg. 5.  
Seems Porsche is making a Euro-Only 911 RS "homologation special" w/ a 
300-hp 3.8 8^) (up from standard 272-hp), stripped interior reducing 
weight by 220 lbs., lower suspension, bigger brakes, and 18-in. wheels. 
Porsche says this venerable beast will move from 0-60 in *5.0*sec. and has 
top speed of 172-mph. Production run will be limited to 1200 units. Any of 
u foreign devils have any more info. on this one or have your order in for 
one?

Really, there's nothing wrong with requiring uniforms. Schools in the LA

our foreign readers probably don't understand the logic of killing children
because they are wearing a blue shirt and not a red and white shirt). Now if
all these gang members were wearing nice black uniforms with deaths heads on
them, they would no longer have the urge to kill each other. (No guarantees

Old Car Stories and the near, miss thread we nearly had a few months ago:
Waaaaaaaaay back in the mid/late fifties before UK instigated real vehicle MOTs 
and there were lots of cheap iron on the road in the same condition as you see 
them in Ohio today, I was browsing around in the very back of a cheap very used 
motor cycle lot. I was an apprentice at the time with a weekly rent more than my
weekly pay and looking for cheap transport like L25 out of the door. Any way in 
the gloom and dust I foud TWO DBR-1s still with race numbers and direct from Le 
Mans. Asking price was L750 each!!! of course to me it was like asking for the 
moon, but in ones dotage one can still dream.............
I did find a bike, a 1933 AJS 500 single, it laste about three months before it 
siezed and I was back to the human powered bike. After that a 1936 Rover Sixteen
with a straight Six and rear hinged doors. That car had the best, silkiest gear 
box ever known to man. Overhauled the engine by sitting on the front fender, 
feet inside the engine bay taking off bits and putting them back with the car 
parked in the street. Engine was to heavy for me to handle other than a bit at a
time.

My first autocross car (before the P-car) - it was gray and cost $900 new

up the Delahayes, Citroen 2CVs, Simcas, Panhards and Peugeots. Also used to

When activating either the left or the right turn signal, BOTH my

According to the owner's manual, this is supposed to happen when a
bulb is defective, but all bulbs are ok (front, side, and rear turn
signals on both sides) I checked the wiring diagram, but that didn't
help because the euro models aren't covered very well (doesn't show 
wiring for parking lights, side turn signals, etc).

Does anyone else have this problem ? So far, I assume that either
the flasher relay is bad, some wiring or ground connection is bad, 
or that the bulbs don't draw enough current. When the hazard light 
is on, the big red button flashes, but the turn signal indicators 
don't. Is this normal behavior ?

     This is a very good mail(below). I have often though that when I get

     training courses offered by Porche (or some other vocational school

     well chosen tools. This initial investment(I'd presume) would get me 
     at least dangerous enough to keep the car in good condition and for 
     the most part stay out of 60/hour shops and in my own garage. (except 
     for something major)

Nathan,

I think I saw in the duPont Registery a hydraulic lift for sale to home mechanics.  Just like a garage, you drive over and can lift your car above your head.  I 
guess you would need the clearance in your garage, maybe 10 feet?  Anyways, the price was $2875 or something like that.

It would probably be cheaper to make a pit in your garage.

Hi All,

I recently came across a 1987 924S at a "Tote your note" style used car 
dealer and I just had to take a look.
I noticed something I thught was rather odd in that the VIN number on the 
windshield pillar (which matches the title) was your typical North 
American #, It started: WPOAA.... But when I looked under the hood I see 
another number stamped on the passenger side firewall area I see a different
number that begins with WPOZZ which I recognize to be a European VIN.
Anyone have an explanation for this?

Also, the car is real clean, 61,000 miles, runs good with no idle vibration
and generally seems well taken care of. The salesman says they have B&R 
and that I can come look at them tomorrow when his boss returns.

What is a ballpark price for a car like this providing the records are 
reasonable?

Wondering,

        The "gauge that resides in the red"  is indicating the amount of oil 
in the tank, not the engine.  As the oil changes temperature, the volume 
will change, and the speed with which it is scavanged out of the "dry" sump 
back into the tank will change.  As the rpm changes, the speed of the 2 oil 
pumps will change, causing the oil distribution between the engine and tank 
to vary.  The gauge is intended as an indication of oil in the system.  To 
REALLY measure it, use the dip stick.

        As to the other questions, not having a 993, I'd have to take yours 
for a spin to see what you're talking about :)

Subject: RE: 944S stalling out


Hi Chris,

If your engine runs fine when cold but has a problem warm, I'd
look for something temperature related.  This could be an injector
o-ring or the intake manifold gasket.  You can test both for vacuum
leaks by dribbling tap water on them.  If, when you dribble it at a
particular place, the engine note changes, or you hear or see the
water being sucked into the intake, you've found a problem.

You cannot get the idle stabilizer out of a 944S without removing
the intake manifold.  When you do so, you will need a new gasket
for the manifold (p/n 944.110.305.02, list $10.80).  It goes on dry,
no sealant.

Could be an O2 sensor; they get slow with age.  However, if after
about three minutes of driving from dead cold, you do not have an
idle problem, I think the O2 sensor is probably not to blame.  That
is, if the problem doesn't surface until long after the cat has lit off
and the DME has started running closed loop, it is not the closed
loop that is causing the problem.

I found that my car is very sensitive to getting the baseline mixture
adjustment correct.  I do not have the spec in front of me, but whatever
is in the workshop manual is what you want.

Hope this helps, keep me posted.

So 45K rolls over on the ol'944s2  odometer and me thinks its maybe time for
some new plugs (last changed at 30k).  Being a modern thinking kind of guy, I
decide to pick-up a set of Bosch platinums - WR5DP - as recommended by Mr.
Bosch himself.  After removing the old plugs - WR7DC - I gap (.75mm) the
platinums, slap on a leetol beet of anti-sieze and in they go.  Since then
it's been running rougher and hotter than before the change.  I should say "it 
seems to be running hotter" since I'm basing this on my opinion that the air 
temperature from the vents with the heater on is noticeably warmer at settings
that were previously acceptable (of course I could be the one full of hot air
on this one).  Trust me on the rougher part!

Are platinums just a bad idea on an '89 944s2?  Should I have used the WR7DP's?
Rechecking the gaps and boots is on my agenda, but that obviously won't help if

  OFFICE MEMO         "9 Months" 911 cabs for sale          Date:  2/15/95

Just for fun I called on the 20th Century Fox Films cars
advertised in the S.F. Chronicle.  They have three red 911
cabs for sale, all made very close in appearance for
obvious reasons.  At least they were close in appearance
*before* filming began.

These cars were used for stunt.  Most of the stunts were
things like crashing into dummy barriers, hard acceleration
and braking, skidding, etc.  Some of it was a bit rougher,
however.  One 88 cab was jumped off a four foot ramp at
high speed, flying airborn across an intersection.   (This
is beginning to sound like Bart's Corvette story that nearly
killed him...or did it kill him?  I've forgotten.  I think it did
kill him; yes I'm sure now.)

Anyway, the guy I talked to pointed out that normally they
just junk stunt cars after a movie but the 911 handled the
abuse so well they are now able to sell it as is (hmmm...).
Crashing through prop barricades mostly just cost a
windshield and headlight here and there.  But the numerous
jumps were a little more serious.  The installed steel
undercarriage panels ("skid plates") protected the running
gear pretty well and the "tubed" tires must have been done
for similar reasons.  The fuel tank had to be pulled, natch.
Other vague changes to the fuel system were done (no doubt
so that it would accelerate to speed without a fuel tank).

All cars had some amount of interior work done so they
looked alike; the 83, a stripped theft recovery, was updated
to look like the other 88's.  And somehow the tops on all
three cars were damaged and need repair, even the 83
"backup stunt car" and 88 show car that weren't jumped.
All cars had been painted too.

There are dozens of caveats for each car, listed on a fact
sheet available by fax.  Some are really funny: "Lights
updated to look like an 88.  May not be wired correctly."
"Electrical system needs to be checked for alterations and
safety."  "Wrong suspension strut was installed on the left
front."  "Some body deformation noted."

Prices?
88 non-stunt: bids start at $25k
88 stunt: bids start at $11k
83 stunt backup: bids start at $12k

Call 415-522-5085 to buy one.  Think of the money you'll
save.  No need for a pre-purchase inspection!

This, to me, has a got to be one of the great 924/944 urban legends.  I too
was informed of this "trick" in order to avoid the Exxon Valdez disaster
at every oil change. So, like any good shade tree mechanic I punched a hole in

off and notice oil gushing from the base of the filter.  "Ah sh*t!!", so
I start spinning it madly and pull it out only to turn it over in the process
and create the Exxon Valdez disaster II on the cowl and my pant leg (hole in 
top was forgotten when hole at bottom began oozing).

These things have drain back valves that prevent them from emptying completely,

Subject: A porschephiles success story...

Hello everyone,

I finally found, checked out and purchased an '84 black 5spd 928S.  Much of
the credit goes you all you Porschephiles who helped answer my newbie
questions, and to one Porschephile in particular who went way, way out of
his way to help:  Alan Watkins of San Diego.

After answering (in great detail) an endless torrent of questions about his
'86 928, and educating me via email on the ins and outs of Porsches, 928's
and cars in general, Alan even took time one Saturday to pick me (a virtual
stranger) up from the San Diego airport (The car was in San Diego. I live
in San Jose) and drove out to see the car with me!!  He even let me drive
his car!  It was _way_ beyond the call of duty. I can't thank Alan enough
(Thank you Alan), and I think he deserves a Porschephiles round of
applause...

I'd say this helps put to rest any undeserved accusations of snobbishness
and unfriendliness that have been or will be directed at Porschephiles,
past, present or future.  I have to believe that this kind of assistance is
what we all joined the list for.

[I hesitate to say it, but even T*d helped.  While searching through the
archives, I came across mechanic recommendation from him for Heyer
Performance in Mountain View, who I've since gone to, and am completely
happy with.  (I guess T*d was only wrong 99.9% of the time.. :-)]

No doubt that the information I got here (and the people I met) on
Porschephiles saved me lots of money, and it's only right that I put some
of that savings toward supporting the list.  Count me in when all the dust
clears about how Stan is going to pay for upgrading the equipment.

Thanks again.  I'll be back when I have something useful to say...  (not
that that's necessarily a requirement for this list... ;-)

Hi all,
    My 2 pennies worth about a couple of things:
1] I agree with all the ideas re: upgrading etc, but I for one would rather
have P'philes maintain its independence from the PCA. Maybe I've run into
small pockets of strangeness in the PCA when I've been a member (admittedly
years ago), but the camraderie (sp?) and helpfulness of all the P'philes I've
contacted seems much more 'real' than what I got from the PCA...
2] I would like to assure our disgruntled new subscriber that any time I've
contacted fellow P'philes about a question, I have been treated with the
utmost respect and helpfulness. Quite the contrary to his experience, I've
found on a number of occasions, that questions I've posed have been treated
as if they were the first time they were heard and the responses were
thoughtful and complete. I guess this is my feeble attempt at saying thanks
for all the help...

Bobby; I have one of those glass roofs on my 944s2, it was manufactured by a
company called Saratoga tops, I believe they have gone out of business as I
no longer see ads for their products.  On the positive side it brings an airy
feel to the interior of the car especially in the pm, has good reflective
qualitys so you do not roast in the midday sun, but the one bad point is that
it rattles incessantly especially when cold and no amount of shimming will
stop it for good.  When they were new they sold for around $7-800 I believe,

Subject: 944 oil gauge light

Sorry if this is an old question, I am new to this group and didn't see any
similar questions in the December archives.

I have an '89 944 S2. When making left turns the oil pressure idiot like
flickers (sometimes). The oil gauge still indicates an adequate oil
pressure. The dealer said that it might be that the sensor is not installed
properly (misaligned or something). A friend of mine said that 944s
sometimes have trouble with the oil pickup (a little clogged), and since
the engine is slanted, this can cause the pressure to drop on turns in one
direction.

Does this ring a bell with anyone? Any suggestions on what to look for? Is
it a problem to drive it this way, or just an annoyance?

P.S. It gets worse as the oil gets older and the level drops.

Subject: RE: 944s2 Plug Quandry


Clark,

There are really at least two issues here.  The first is using heat range 5
versus heat range 7 plugs.  The 5 is a colder plug, meaning that it has a
shorter nose and, for that reason, its electrode will run cooler.  Porsche
has OK'ed both the 5 and 7 for the 944S2 (not sure about 968).  The 5
might have some advantage if you track the car.  For a pure street car,
a 7 is probably indicated.

A plug which is too cold will take longer too (or may never) reach self-
cleaning temperature, about 400 degrees C.  Which makes it (more)
prone to fouling.  Some mechanics dislike the platinum design because
its electrode design -- small and flush with the nose -- makes it more
susceptible to fouling.

The rough idle you experience is what I would expect when switching down
a heat range or two.  I tried a set of 5's in my own car (944S) a few years
ago, and had just the symptoms you describe.

Gap the plugs to the low end of the range: 0.7 mm.  The gap opens up over
time, and the 0.8 is more or less the top end of what you want, to my
understanding.  Don't use anti-seize on the threads.  Bosch ships the
plugs coated with a lubricant which they feel is adequate and correct.

Two things about the '87 911.
 -It was the first year the 911 saw the hydrolicly activated clutch.  
 This is opposed to the cable.  It behaves more smoothly.
 -It was the first year of the G50 transmission.  I felt the shifter on 
 one once in an '87 w/ >110k and was amazed at the improvement

My 944 is standing on jackstands (4) all winter long and i use a floor jack
to raise one
side (where the HAYNES manual is saying) install two jacks then do the same

I've had the car 8 years now. I've always assumed my temps were normal. (A 
little on the high side) But since moving to 5500' altiture (New Mexico) it 
has gotten worse. (Thin air means less perf. and less cooling mass)

But, now I may have a problem. Oil temp gets to midscale in 32 degree 
weather (climbing) and 5/6 scale on hot days up long grades. Never too close 
to red line because I'll slow down before that.

I replaced the oil cooler 'O' rings many years ago and cleaned out the oil 
cooler at the same time, so I can rule that out.

Hate to admit but I'm not right and you're not wrong:-). The gauge response

Yes, it is true, these are available in two versions the RS and the RSR, `natch.
The RSR comes ready to race with roll-cage, extinguishers, engine cut-out

a whale tail type fixed rear spoiler, and the RSR has a bizzare bi-plane adjustable

Any body out there ever driven an old TR6?

When you met another TR did the driver wave, and exhibit that "hey nice 
to see another mug" behaviour. The chances are he did.

When I drive the 944, other porsche driver always avoid any
acknowledgement of the existence of my car. If I am sitting at lights 
along side another porsche the drivers always seem to stare ahead, 
careful to avoid eye contact. You are actually more likely to get a smile 
from a chap on a motor bike, than a p-driver

This could be just a UK attitude, we have a year of registration indicator
on our plates, so every one knows how old my car is. I think what happens 
is - 

other driver says hmm my cars newer than his so I am superior, so I won't
wave
or - 
my car is older than that "clever clogs" so I am not going to toady to HIM
or - 
I have a 911 so I am not going to wave to that 924 driver...... 

When the 924 first came out PClub GB would not accept 924 drivers as 
members, this persisted until the 924 turbo came out.


From the above, I would conclude that there is a high level of elitism 
among UK porsche driver - though having said that, the few other porsche 
owners that I meet regularly are charming people, so it could be that the 
types I refered to above are not clubby people.

Of course it is probably different in the US, where a newish porsche does 
not cost more than 1 years average income.

Somehow I don't think the bank that just loaned you 30-50k or so would

Subject: More on cyl head temp gauges

 
>What, you got a TIT gauge now and burning kerosene...
 
(For the politically correct, TIT is turbine inlet temp.)
 
No, not turbines. And not burning kerosene. The thing was a Piper Apache
which burned oil. My instructor would not let me fire it up if there were
any strangers on the ramp, if any FAA types saw this thing's oil smoke on
startup, they would probably ground it. (In fact, it was just like starting
up every 911, new or old, I've ever driven). I think the airplane eventually
lost an engine, had to do an off-field landing and stuffed one main gear
strut through the wing. At a value of $10,000 (with two high-time engines)
it wasn't worth saving. The Apache is a great trainer because Vmc, minimum
control speed with the critical engine out, is only a few knots below Vxse,
best angle of climb speed (for avoiding those trees you noticed at the end of
the runway just as the critical engine failed).
 
Thermocouples need to be temperature compensated to read accurate
temperature; otherwise they generate a voltage based on the delta t between
the connections. Consider a Type J (iron-constantan) TC:
 
     _iron_______
    /            |
   o             V                          This is an uncompensated TC.
    \____________|copper leads in rest of circuit.
      constantan
 
 
You may wonder if the junctions between the iron and copper, and constantan
and copper, don't generate voltage of their own. There is something called
the Law of Intermediate Metals: "If a third metal is in the circuit as
shown, the net emf [voltage] of the circuit is not affected as long as the
new connections are at the same temperature."
 
A compensated thermocouple is like the following, using either a container
of ice and water (usually a thermos flask with ice and water) or an
electronic ice point which typically uses a small camera battery for power.
 
                ____constantan_____________________
               /                                   |
junction      o                                    V
(measuring     \_iron____     __constantan_________|
point)                   |   |
                   ||    |   |     ||
                   ||    |   |     ||
                   ||     \  /     ||
                   ||      o       ||
                   ||==============||  ice water bucket
 
Assuming a linear thermocouple response, measuring temperatures with the
other junction (you have another thermocouple junction, even if you don't
know it; if there is no compensating TC, the other junction is inside the
measuring instrument, where the connections are made) at room temperature,
say 70 deg F, instead of 32 deg F results in a temperature measuring error
of 38 deg. (70 - 32). If what you are trying to measure is at 70 deg F and
the gauge is also at 70 deg, you measure a temperature of zero (actually
measuring temperature DIFFERENCE). So if you use the example of leaving
Chicago on a -30 deg day, and flying to Death Valley where it is 120, your
uncompensated TC will read high on departure and low on arrival.
 
TCs are not strictly linear, but that's the general idea.
To see how nonlinear they are: (gauge will not read 30 deg. too high if
flying in air 30 deg. above freezing point of water):
 
Let's see, suppose actual EGT is 1200 deg. F and ambient is -30, gauge
sees 37.694 millivolts, which it "thinks" is 1250 deg. F. (not exactly the
62 deg. difference you expect but close).
 
Second case, actual EGT 1200 deg F and ambient 120, gauge sees 33.473 mV
which it interprets as 1124 deg. Again not exactly the 88 deg difference you
expect but only about 10 deg. off.
 
So now we have a temperature gauge swing of 126 degrees, while true exhaust
temperature has not changed at all (assuming this fictitious airplane
doesn't undergo mixture changes as air gets hotter/colder/thinner/denser.)
and ambient air temperature has changed not by 126 but by 150 degrees.
 
This is why for any accurate (laboratory) temperature measurement you need
an ice point of some sort.
 
I found more cylinder head temperature gauge stuff in the Aircraft Spruce
and Specialty catalog. 714-870-7551.
 
They have a CHT setup for kit planes using VW or Rotax engines, which I
figure would be perfect for 4-cyl Porsches. An individual 0-600 deg F gauge
is $35, an individual 14 mm spark plug gasket-type sensor is 10.30. Says
"multiple switching available." Leads are 4 ft. long.
 
Also an EGT setup, 700 to 1700 deg F, $35; clamp type senders with 3/16 dia.
probe, 1/2 or 1" long tip, $23.45; bayonet type 1/4" threads, $28.80;
bayonet type for VW, 1.5" OD tailpipe, $23.40. Leads are 4 ft. long.
 
It looks to me like these are lots cheaper than the prices I got from the
Pegasus catalog. Adds to about $150, not counting a rotary selector switch to
go to different cylinders. (Usually you put this stuff on #3 and assume
you're not running exceptionally lean on any others).
 
Wait, here it is, selector switch for EGT or CHT, they have 2,4, and 6
cylinder switches, $18.45 for 4 cyl and $21.85 for six.
 
But there's more. Next page shows quad CHT and EGT gauges. $139 each. They
also have add-on kits and "engine analyzer kits" which include all the extra
sensors and selectors.
 
They also have "scanners" which cycle through all cylinders and display the
EGT or CHT and a pointer to indicate which cylinder is currently being
read. Blurb says "These scanners feature circuitry which automatically
compensates for ambient temperature with an error of less than 2%. ...very
low power design, operating on less than 20 mA on 12 or 24 V systems. The
unit can be powered by a single 9 V transistor battery if normal aircraft
battery is not available." Sounds like an electronic ice point thermocouple
set up.

I think the car you're looking at is about $3K too high ($23K max) for the
condition you describe.  For general comparison, the local
Porsche/MB/Mega-dealer has a 87 Carrera  Grand Prix White with spoilers for
$21,825...probably buy for under $20K.   This is in the "soon to be unfrozen
Midwest", and am not familar with the car or condition so I can't qualify
it's value.  My own judgement is based  on what I sold my 88 Carrera for
several months ago.  If you're interested, drop me an E-mail and I'll give
you a contact with the dealer (no affiliation, but they are supporters of our
PCA Region and MBCA section).

By the way, same dealer has an 88 928S4 they describe as "showroom new!"
(make your own interpretation) for $22,950.

The Zeroes are also quite good in the snow, and as a 944 has a 50-50

          Since joining this list two weeks ago, I've learned an 
          immeasurable amount of information about P-cars.  I've bought 
          texts that have been mentioned in p-philes and am very thankful 
          for the guidance everyone gives!  Sometime ago I "inherited" what
          is a shell and frame of a 1957 356A.  The car's body and frame 
          are in excellent condition, it's been in storage for about 20+ 
          years (I've been drooling over it since I was 7, I'm 28 now).  
          Now for the problem - this car has NOTHING on it.  No gauges, 
          interior, trim, electrical, windscreen, trans, or motor.  The 
          chassis is rolling, but the car has been modified somewhat:  Disk 
          brakes, Carrera GT style roll bar, flared rear wheel wells.  
          Since the previous owner is no longer with us, and not thinking I 
          would ever aquire it, I never asked about the car's history.  
          According to his wife, it seems that he was trying to make it 
          into a "Carrera GT" but never able to find the proper drive train 
          (or be able to afford it, according to Hemmings, nore will I).
          
          I WANT to finish it.  Because of the mods, I don't think it's 
          worth much, so I don't want to follow a concours restoration.  
          I've seen numerous advertisers supplying 356 resto parts, any 
          recommendations?  I want this car to be my daily driver when it's 
          done (summer only), so I need a motor and trans that would hold 
          up to spirited driving, and which parts are plentiful. Maybe a 
          912?  Any suggestions?

My understanding is that the "ZZ's" are "universal" wehen the VIN is stamped on
the chassis. If the last 4-5 digits are identical this 
would indicate that it is *not* a hybrid of few cars.

Subject: 944 belt case vent hose

Kirk Shafer asked about a vent hose that runs from the upper corner of the
cam belt cover to the air filter case.  Porsche has issued a bulletin to
remove this hose and cap off the connections at the air filter box and belt
cover with rubber caps sold by your friendly Porsche dealer parts people
(they are very inexpensive).

The bulletin can be found at the back of the Euro Select Parts catalog.
No reason is given but my guess is that it keeps belt fluff from clogging
up the air filter when the sprockets eat a belt.

By the way, belt fluff detection is a good argument for keeping your
engine clean.  When it starts to show up on the engine you have maybe a
couple of very short trips before all the teeth are eaten through and it
is time to replace the belt and the offending sprocket.

dump 500 lbs of boiling sodium into concrete crucibles for the US Nuclear

explosions were from hydrogen released by the sodium/concrete reactions.

We used to practice extinguishing sodium fires by burning a brick weighing
about two lbs in air.  Spraying water on it just produced lots of smoke.
In short, it is not nearly as reactive as we have all been led to believe
by our high school chemistry teachers.

    I'm guessing the reason you could put out the prick was because of
its low surface area per unit volume.  Try that with POWDERED sodium,

Sorry if this was already posted, but I wrote several days
ago and have not seen it yet.

I'm leaving frigid Connecticut to spend next week in 
southern England (Westerham,Kent area?). I have 
Saturday the 25th free in London. I get to ride in our 
rep's de-badged M5! Hope I can drive... 
YANKEE WARNING!

Any Porsche-related or other cool things that I could check out?
Anyone want to have some fish and chips? (People told
me the food there was not very good, but I found it was
excellent!).

(Our rep had a 928 but was too wide for his garage so
he got a 930 turbo. But the M5 is a better salesman's car)

Keith Roberts says, "I noticed something I thught was rather odd in that the
VIN number on the windshield pillar (which matches the title) was your
typical North American #, It started: WPOAA.... But when I looked under the
hood I see 
another number stamped on the passenger side firewall area I see a different
number that begins with WPOZZ which I recognize to be a European VIN.
Anyone have an explanation for this?"

Keith, my 1988 924S has the same...AA on the windshield pillar plate, AA on
the paper stickers in various places (door, by battery, underside of hood,
etc.), but it has ZZ on the underhood plate.  I can't offer an explanation
for that.

Ah, memories of college....parking my roomie's Dauphine on a hill so I could
push start it with a foot out the door (as opposed to using the crank
supplied by an understanding factory), and, finally,  coasting to a stop so I
could run back and find the carburetor that LITERALLY fell off the engine as
I rounded a corner!

Subject: RE: region formation

Stan -

As I had promised, I went looking for the old porcedure manual I had on 
the shelf.  There is a section on region formation which has 6 
requirements.  They are:

	1.  There must be 25 or more who subscribe to the general 
objectives of the club and who will not adopt rules that are inconsistent 
with the National Bylaws.

	2.  Talks about forming a region out of territory already aprt of 
another region.........this doesn't seem to apply,but what territory 
would we have?

	3.  Talks about funds from previous region not being owned by the 
new region and any National dues going to the old region stay until a 
charter is granted.

	4.  You must have elected officials.

	5.  Must submit a signed petition to become chartered.  Must be 
signed by officers, any current PCA members and others who have applied 
for membership.  There must be a minimum of 25 people including officers.

	6.  Must submit region bylaws within 60 days.

Further it states that you should incorporate (though not necessarily) to 
limit liability of officers of the club and National.  Dues are $36 per 
year with part of it being refunded to the region and the remainder going 
to publish Panorama, insurance for club activities, salaries and expense 
for maintaining the National Executive office and general expenses for 
National officers meetings and attending Parades.

I would assume most of this would be in your Region Formation packet but 
just in case I have submitted it here.

Just read a question about a 944 pressure gage and that
prompted me to ask this question about my 84 928S gage.

I remember reading somewhere that the gage should 
register 5 bar at about 5,000 RPM.  My gage (when the
engine is at normal operating temperature) indicates
3 bar at idle and just hits 5 bar at 2,000 RPM.

The questions I have are as follows:  what do you other
928 folk experience?  Could my gage be inaccurate and
should I care (as long as I register oil pressure, should
it matter how much?)?  Is there some way to test this 
without replacing the gage?  Could the sender be fouled
and, if so, is this something I can clean?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions, hints, or advice!

SAVE THIS MESSAGE.  For those of you who keep sending admin messages to the
list, watch my lips *real* close while I say again, SAVE THIS MESSAGE.

I have just spoken with my bank and made arrangements to set up the account this
Friday afternoon.  Since I work in Silver Spring, MD, and live 30 miles away,
I don't get home soon enough to do this except on Friday, when they stay open
until 1800 (6:00 PM EST).

Hold off on mailing any checks until I give you the account numbers this 
weekend.  I'd like Stan to give me the "Official" account name, via the list,
before Friday.  I suggest, simply, "Porschephiles."

I made the arrangements, and have an appointment to sign papers, with 

Cathy Laster,
NationsBank, Crofton Office
2227 Defense Highway
Crofton, MD  21114
(410) 793-0770

Initially, this will be set up as a "Non-Profit Organization Savings Account"
(Number will be provided, you should make checks "for deposit only to acct ####)
which charges no fees.  When we have received (the majority of) the initial 
donations, we will change the account to a "Non-Profit Organization *Checking* 
Account.  The reason is that the later has a $1.00 monthly maintenance fee, 
but also charges $0.30 per transaction (in or out) over 100 transactions/mo.

I told Stan this already, but I don't believe that we'll have any trouble 
setting Porschephiles up as a tax-exempt, educational organization.  I've 
gone through this once for out local Nosepickers Society of Crabtown (home of
Canoe-U), and it's pretty simple.  We will need pretty quick:

Constitution
Statement of Educational purpose (should be pretty simple, given what we do)
By-laws

I'd like to have this in place *real* soon.  If we keep it simple at first, we
should be able to do this before I make the first deposit.  I'm assuming tax
liability when I sign the papers as custodian, so I'd like to keep it as clean
as possible.

Slate of Officers/ 
Board of Directors
IRS forms.  

Any shys...ooops, sorry gang (never P*ss off anyone from whom you want something
*free*...) Lawyers out there want to provide any pro-bono comments?

Like, is our focus too narrow to qualify as "educational"?  Is there another
category that would fit us better (hint, what does PCA qualify under, Stan
cited the section...)?  *quick* responses from *quallified* sources appreciated.

SAVE Porschephiles #2 will propose Constitution & by-laws, stay tuned to this 
network...

Subject: Movie Porsches

The recent discussion of P-cars used in movies and offered for sale 
reminded me of the best Porschephiles movie of all time, KING OF THE 
MOUNTAIN.  It starred Harry Hamlin (pre LA LAW), and Dennis Hopper and a 
few others whose names I forget or were forgettable.  Of course the main 
stars were the cars, a California-ized Silver '57 or '58 Carrera Speedster, 
a '63 Vette and a slew of other great cars with cameo appearances by 
serveral other Porsches.  It was the the eternal battle of good versus 
evil, Harry Hamlin vs Dennis Hopper, Sane vs Insane, Porsche vs Chevy.  
Naturally our "hero" triumphed in the end.

I wonder what ever happened to that speedster?  

On another note, remember the 356 Cab. that Bruce Boxleitner drove in 
SCARECROW AND MRS KING.  I think it met some terrible fate, either over a 
cliff or blown up.  I wonder if anyone ever picked it up for salvage 
after the studio disposed of it?

I am sure there are other famous movie star Porsches out there.  Maybe we 
ought to do a Where Are They Now?

Just some random thoughts.  And yes, maybe I do have to much idle time.

Subject: Engine-turned sheet metal

 
There are different ways to do it. Some machinists like to use a wooden
dowel in a milling machine, with lapping compound. Some like those new
scotchbrite-like pads stuck to the end of a dowel. Good for one swirly mark
apiece before you need to glue another on (tedious).
 
I found a method I like. I coat the work with a thin layer of oil, sprinkle
some carborundum abrasive on it (experiment with different sizes to get the
effect you want) and run a rubber disc (used for pressure-sensitive adhesive
backed grinding discs, but without the abrasive) into the work. It's quick, you
just need to brush some of the oil-carbo mixture onto the spot you are going
to hit next, run the disc down manually (drill press works fine) and presto,
swirly marks.

Subject: Valve clearance status...

If at first you don't succeed...

Thanks to all who gave insight into possible causes of the zero clearance,
but the problem was more stupid than anyone(including myself) imagined.

Frustrated, I tore down the head in question the valve seats looked fine
and all the springs/caps seemed to be dead level with each other.  Okay, so
I can use the same machine shop again; that was reassuring.

Could FAT of sent me a faulty cam?  Pull lifters, rotate to TDC for #3 and #4
while visually inspecting the cam and its lobes.  Seemed to be dead flat for
both at TDC for each.  Okay, so FAT lives up to it's name.

So, I built the head back up and torqued it down.  While installing the 
rockers and attempting yet again to set the clearance, the problem moved 
from #4 to #3!  Then I noticed the problem existed for #4 as well!  If I
were in Denmark I would of smelled something rotten.

I backed off the rockers a bit and wiggled them back and forth with one hand
while I moved the pushrod up with the other(I don't have the luxury of an
engine stand - the engine is on a bench) and low and behold - pop goes the
pushrod.  The pushrod had not seated at the bottom of the lifter!  I had
more clearance now than I knew what to do with.  So, repeat process for 
*all* of the cylinders to correct the problem(it existed on many of the
other pushrods as well.

Everything is wonderful again and my spirits lifted.  I can't believe how
ridiculous the problem was, but I perserverd in spite of my ignorance.  I 
still can't believe the pushrods could of opened the valves without seating
themselves on the lifters.  Bizarre.  

And so the rebuild saga continues...

Bruce Anderson offers Porsche training for both 911's and 356's, as well 
as a separate class for transmissions.  See his ad in Excellence, and

I replaced a set of old Bilsteins on my 84 928S with all
new Bilsteins and am very happy with the ride.  It's not
a soft ride (i.e., you can feel the road surface texture 
quite nicely) but it won't loosen your dental fillings either.

The suspension is designed for a specific combination
of shock and spring ... I have no idea what the effect
would be of putting a stiffer shock without changing the
springs.

Subject: 1995 Porsche 993 at Daytona

Pfellow Pfilers:

	I had previously mentioned the new 993 that ran at Daytona
in GTS-2.  I have more information from Bob LaPiana, who was part
of the crew.  From rec.auto.sport.info, the 993 finished:

26. (GTS-2, 13th) Jarett Freeman, Portland, Ore., Simon Gregg,
Jacksonville, Fla., Nort Northam, Winter Park, Fla., Max Schmidt,
Oglesby, Ill., and Rusty Schmidt, Vail, Colo., Porsche 911, 553.


    The the mods made to the 1995 993 were.

   *  Removal of brake shields, A/C, radio, interior, sunroof motor
      and mufflers, the catalytic conveter was still in place.

   *  Springs and shocks were changed and the car was lowered.

   *  Added a roll cage, fuel cell, radio and battery cutoff.

   *  Used Cool Carbon brake pads.

   *  Stock wheels (7x17 and 9x17) with Street legal Toyo tires.

   
      The car was driven by Jarett Freeman, Simon Gregg, Nort Northam and
   Max Schmidt.  It was Simon Greggs racing professional debut (Peter's son).
   The car was owned by Bud and Jarett Freeman.  The only things we changed
   during the race were tires and brake pads.  We added about one quart of
   oil and about 2 oz. of brake fluid.  The brake fluid was added when the
   left front brake pad went metal to metal and a little fluid leaked out.


                                                       Bob LaPiana
                                                     W: (407) 356-8367

   P.S.    The car was driven to and from the track.  Only the windshield
           was cleaned before the drive home.  The car was FLAWLESS.


	Also, interestingly enough, I met Max Schmidt here in Denver when we
were both looking at an '81 911SC coupe.  We spent a couple of hours checking
the car out and gabbing about racing.  He mentioned they were trying to put
something together for Daytona....

	Cool.

Subject: Electronic Region/PCA

Hi all,
At the risk of being *flammed* big time, here goes: As for becoming a PCA
region, well For Stan it may be good to use the `not for profit status', but
otherwise I think it's not a good idea. It will only create more uneeded
bureaucracy. If Stan is willing to keep the list going, I'd be more than 
happy to kick in for new hardware. If we do send money to Stan, he may 
have new problems with getting this income and taxes as a profit business.
I think that it also excludes people that are not Porsche owners from having
access to this great info/insight. I thought internet access was public
domain, by becoming part of PCA it becomes private in some respects. Don't
get me wrong, I think PCA is great as well, I'm a member. But I don't think
it applies here. The bottom line is that if Stan wishes to continue the list,
Great!!, but why get caught up in more bull from an organization. Just an
additional $.02.

Actually, this sounds very much like the US. I drove a variety of Triumphs
years ago (RHD TR3, LHD TR3, TR4A), and waves to other drivers of similar
cars almost always elicited a return wave, or some other acknowledgement.
When I drove a Lotus Elan (the early one), an encounter with any other
Lotus was virtually certain to include some type of waving, if not
stopping to talk (or perhaps we just simulaneously stopped to fix
something which broke, a common occurance with these cars).

When I got my first Porsche (a 1967 911S, in 1970), I found much less
waving, etc among the Porsche crowd, and virtually none with the other
up-scale sports cars of the era. Now, when I wave to another Porsche
from my 944S, it seems I almost always get some type of a "what kind
of nut are you?" look in response.

I don't know if the change was chronological, or was related to the
cost of the cars, or their previous relative rarity, but there certainly
has been a change.

Subject: Engine Rebuild for 914/6, to 2.2E


I am rebuilding the engine in my 914/6 to a 2.2E motor.  The main question I
have is about the crank.  Since the original motor is based on a 69 911T motor,
the crank is not counterweighted.  The rods may be different as well.  I am
wondering if the crank will be up to the stresses of the larger discplacement
as well as a slightly higher RPM redline.  I don't plan on spinning it any 
higher than 6500, but would want to know if that would be safe/reliable.  

I know that some racer types use the non-counterweighted cranks to lessen 
reciprocating weight, but they tear down their motors more often than I want
to!  Any ideas??

Subject: RE: Porsche Dauphine


One of my cohorts at Berkely in the sixties was a guy named Keith 
Duckworth. Keith's dad had bought him a '59 Dauphine for graduation to
commute in (this wa in '64). The paint was a real beat pale blue and it 
leaked everywhere. My roommate had a '62 B coupe that Keith would have 
killed for.

We decided to help out friend a little. I went out and bought some black 
paint and a vacuum cleaner paint spray kit from JC Whitney. We painted it 
black, the paint was decent. It still looked plain though. I had a few 
beers and a plan formed. I got some blue metalflake paint and put scallops
on it, adding some bad imitations of Von Dutch's pinstriping in places 
that seemed appropriate. My room mate thought this was great, but the 
front was too high. I made a modification to the front that dropped it 2 
inches.

We all piled in the following Saturday to go cruising. More women thought 
the damn thing was cute. The guys laughed at it. Anyone that cruised East
14th Street in 1964-65 will remember it. My room mate and I painted one
pink for a lady he was seeing, white scallops there.

Keith sold the Renault to buy his first Porsche in 1966. He still has that 
1964 SC coupe. We still get a few laughs out of the Dauphine.

You should be able to find your color ID label in the boot, passenger's

Same thing here. The only Porsche people who greet each other on the road
are the 356 folk. Porsches of all descriptions are common here in California
so maybe the owners don't make a big deal of seeing another. It's not
unusual at an intersection to look around and see most of the basic Porsche

In Germany, 911 drivers used to flash their headlights at each other, about

Thanks for all the advice on tires. I would have responded earlier but AOL
mail has lately been slower than snail mail. There has been a little debate
whether or not putting H rated Yokohama A509 would cripple a '73 911S targa.
 Here are some of the positive responses to my comments. They will remain
anonymous to leave the authors out of this little debate-

"I've A509s in 225/50-16.  I  would buy them again."

"Highly biased, personally, to the A509 or AVS Intermediate for 911
applications
that don't involve "serious" driving"

Now for some negative comments and my answers to their criticisms.

Ben asked "Is it really worth it to cripple your 911 to save that cash
($200)?" 

I would agree with him if I planned on racing my car. However, I'm not
planning on it and there are several other factors that come into play.
Anyway, it's not like I'm planning on putting the cheapest tires I can find.
I'm buying one of the better (best?) H rated tires on the market. Which will
be better than any tire that the car originally came with.

 I don't plan on going over 130mph. I would like to but it isn't realistic or
advisable to try in Florida. Too many state troopers with radars. In N.
California it was possible to hit speeds over 130 at  3 A.M. on 280 between
Woodside Road and Black Mountain because the the police couldn't ambush you
with radar. But I live here in Florida where that is impossible, just ask
Jose Canseco- the baseball player.

Ben continues "you also need to consider how many g you are pulling in
acceleration and deceleration," 

 I don't plan on going racing and Miami roads don't demand much from the
tires as the city is laid out in a grid system. There just aren't any
interesting roads to street race on, which is what you seem to like. Come
drive here in Miami and you will see what I'm talking about. The only
excitement I get is from one large roundabout and one highway  on-ramp.
Expensive hi-performance tires aren't necessary in stop'n go traffic or on
straight 60mph roads. That's the reality here.

other stud that is missing is on of the studs that holds the breather on top
of the motor. This I have found replacement for localy and doesen't

Subject: Re: Cleaning a neglected car

Dear Steve:

Your question of the best way to clean a neglected car with little effort was
answered "Take it to a detailer". 

This is the easiest, albeit the most expensive.  A less costly yet more labor
intensive might include the following.

1. Insure that the car is cool to the touch and in shade, then wash the car
thoroughly with a quality car wash and dry.

2. Pick a fender, or door or any surface of the car that is separated by a
seam.  Complete all the below steps on this ONE area before moving onto
another area.  This way you don't start out on Saturday morning full of
energy and strip all the wax off the car and then run out of steam (or get
handed some honeydo's) and leave the car stripped of all wax.  

Note: The following steps are listed in the most conservative (read labor
intensive/easiest on the car) order.  Any solvents used on your Porsche's
paint should be tested prior to use.  Pick an area of the paint that is not
visible.  I like to use the seam under the rocker panels.  It is almost
invisible and has a nice coat of paint.  Apply a little solvent to your rag
and rub the test area.  If paint does not stain the rag, then in all
probability, the solvent is safe for your paint.  If it does stain the rag,
you may wish to use a different solvent.

3. Clean the surface of the paint with a quality glaze. I prefer 3M Imperial
Hand Glaze but there are several other quality glazes.  Apply the glaze to
your 100% cotton cloth or applicator pad and gently rub in a back to front /
front to back motion. Work the glaze into the surface thoroughly and allow to
dry.  Buff out using another soft 100% cotton cloth. (I use my wife's old
flannel sheets). If this has produced the finish you desire, then follow up
with a quality hard wax. Apply the wax with your fingers and buff out with
yet another cotton cloth.  Move onto another section of the car.  

4. The track rubber marks will come out this way, but will take some time and
effort.  For areas that are especially difficult to remove try using either
P21S Total Auto Wash, Wurth Citrus Degreaser or Oil Flo Safety Solvent to
remove these marks. (I use the Oil Flo). Take a soft cloth, apply a small
amount of one of the above solvents to the cloth and gently rub out the
rubber mark.  These products will not normally harm a hardened paint if used
as directed.  Immediately rinse the area to remove any trace of the solvent.
Dry and if the mark is gone, give the spot area another quick glaze.  Then
apply a coat of wax to the entire section.

5. If your car looks like it was hit with a canon blast of black gum drops (3
days at Watkins Glen), then you may wish to reverse steps 3 and 4.  The
safest method of using any solvent is to allow it to remain in contact with
the paint for ONLY the amount of time that it takes to do the job and rinse
completely. 

6. For wheel wells, spray one of the above solvents directly onto the area to
be cleaned.  Allow a few moments for the solvent to work, gently sponge or
use a VERY soft brush to loosen the grime.  Rinse with a lot of water to
remove all traces of the solvent.  Dry throughly.  A trick to reduce the
amount of crud that builds up in the wheel wells is to give them a coat of
Sonax Hard Wax Spray.  This will provide a thin coat of wax to help stop the
build up street grunge and track "rubber snakes".

If you have any questions or wish amplification of any of the above, please
let me know.

Subject: Extrude Honing/951 engine rebuild

Someone over on the quattro list sez (wrt EH of turbo parts):
"I estimated the hp by isolating this addition (one of the few I did as stand
alone) with the vericom and/or the g alnalyst (can't remember which since I
did it about 1 1/2 yrs ago...  I did help a guy do this (EH the exh impellor
and housing only) on a 944turbo that sat on the dyno and we got +14hp @6200
isolating the EH and a torque increase as well (1.8bar at 2100rpm vs 1.8@3k
b4).  Definitely a must do at 100.00.  All you need is some patience (EH
turnaround is about 2weeks) and a rebuild kit for your turbo.  Just about
EVERY racer that runs a turbo has this as a speed secret (no more!).  If you
want some more unbelievable numbers, send your intake/head/exhaust man/turbo
as a single unit to EH and they will match all four components and the
results of this defy any logical explanation, the results are phenominal..."

The way I understand it, EH increases air-flow by removing a tiny layer from 
treated parts.  How exactly do they do this, is it by acid-dipping and does 
this weaken parts?  Is EH recommended for *street* engines with occasional 
track excursions?  I would not think of taking my engine apart to do this now 
but when it's time for a re-build, I'd consider it then.  I've also talked to 
a couple of people who've rebuilt their 2.5L Turbo to a 2.8L.  One guy who did
that is now building a 3.0L Turbo using a 944S2 block and '89 TurboS 
head/turbo/brakes etc with custom chips.  
He's expecting 300-330 reliable HP.  Any comments?

if it stretched I'd guess you have a heat or detonation problem - it;s
gotta get pretty hot to soften the valve doesn't it ?
also a tuliped valve head would seem the same - horrible results
(did one in an airplane I was flying once - yeee haaa :-()

however, if any of that happened - the valve/rocker clearance would decrease
wouldn't it ?  I would have thought it would have to increase to
give you the tick.

Artie Mitchell drove a 911 in the early 70's.  He got so irritated at other
Porsche drivers waving at him and flashing their lights at him that he painted
the car with a brush, using different colors of paint, with the intention of
making the car look so bad that no other Porsche driver would acknowledge him.

I can see the problems with PCA affiliation for those in other parts of
the world.  Why not think in terms of "Electronic Frontier Region"
affiliation with as many Porsche-related organizations as possible?  If
affiliation with PCA is feasible, similar affiliation with PCGB or
other groups (the factory?) may also be feasible.  Each affiliation
would be for individuals for whom it makes sense.  For instance, it
wouldn't make much sense for me to be affiliated with PCGB.

Just a thought...

This wasn't a movie, but I was flipping channels once and saw a thing on

The only real greeting while driving my 914 (only had it for one summer so

always if I see another 914 (quite rare). As for the 944 owners, no offense, but

Unknowingly, there was a sheet of ice on the hill--with no warning--just over

carefully dropping my speed to 5mph. Sure enough the 911 wouldn't stop and,

Subject: Re: sebring ramblings(long)

Apologies to everyone who asked for Sebring info. This is the first time all
week that I've felt conscious enough to type legibly. It was a long and
exhausting weekend.
Let it be said that it sure was a shock to go from the single digits of PA to
the 60's and 70's. Even had some sun.
First of all it was the 60 hours of Sebring since the event started on
Friday. The catch was that on Fri the event was run under driver's ed rules
instead of PCA racing rules, i.e. no passing in the corners or in the braking
zones. In spite of our best intentions some of us, well, forgot that little
rule and apparently scared the bejesus out of the drivers ed guys. Sorry Pat,
we didn't mean to be a problem and Axel sends his apologies for his numerous
transgressions.
I had never been to Sebring before and it was unlike any track I've ever
visited. First of all it is huge with 17 turns and some serious straights. It
is also flat and very rough. In fact the FIA berms were the smoothest part of
the track. It took me all of Friday (4 sessions) to find the track and
develop a line. The track is so wide in some places that you can go four
abreast thru a couple of the turns then it turns right around and becomes
narrow. It is also very fast with average speeds for my group (E stock) being
over 85MPH. Turn 16 dumped you off onto a HUGE straight. Not only was it long
but wide since they used to land B52's on the straight. It wasn't unusual to
see 6 to 8 cars going down that straight together. Not one after the other
but roughly abreast. It's that wide. The other major problem was reference
points. I'm sure that they are there but the area really is featureless.
My braking point at the end of the 150MPH straight was a bunch of cows on an
adjacent farm. Tragically the cows had a propensity to move around as did my
braking point. In short it was a tough track to learn and be proficient,
 with the home field advantage being a factor until well into the weekend.
Saturday started the actual race practice sessions. There were a few fender
benders but nothing serious. There did seem to be allot of attrition however.
Our group of Riesentoter members had to come to the aid of one of ours and
drop the engine and trans out of his 73 911 S. We found a loose flywheel and
no other damage. He ended up only missing 2 run groups.
There were about 200 entries and I have never seen such an amazing group of P
cars in one place. The quality of the cars was sensational! There were also
some professional teams there such as Kelly-Moss. They had 4 cars present and
boy were they ever competitive. Of course there were your usual 935's, 934's
and everything else as well as a mid engined Porsche that was a thinly
disguised 962.
The Sunday races went very well with no serious incidents although there again
 was an unusual amount of attrition (rough surface.. long stretches at full
throttle?) There were 47 cars in my race group which consisted of E1, E and F
stock. The other race groups had a likewise number of entrants. The starts
were spectacular and noisy. You had to watch your tach carefully as hearing
was impossible. Imagine 47 cars trying to get thru the first corner. Exciting
and frightening.
I had qualified 20th and had a really great, fun race. I spent the last 3
laps one on one with a 930. We passed each other about 3 times a lap.
Unfortunately he passed me last and beat me by a headlight at the finish
line. I ended up in 15th place and couldn't be happier. Not bad for a 50 year
old dentist who had never seen the track before. If anyone needs specific
info let me know as I have some of the results sheets. I think Pat Moyer
(national rep) will post all results as soon as he receives them.
It was a once in a lifetime experience and everyone that does Club Racing
should really try and be there next year. It is worth the effort and expense.

Flashers,

        You must remember when the flashing started.  It was in the '50s 
when German cars COULD flash, and British cars couldn't (because of the 
Lucas Electrics of course).  With Detroit Iron, it took too much effort to 
find the knob, then pull and push it.

        These days, the only cars feeling it necessary to demonstrate they 
still can flash are 356s.  The British still can't.  911s became so common 
people began wearing out their switches.

The fuel line recall is still in effect.  If you have braided fuel lines 
then you need to take the 914 to any dealer and have them update it.

Bill, unless you are going to get R1's you should go to NTW (National Tire
Warehouse). They have great prices, and usually treat your wheels properly.
The ones around Philadelphia know how particular Porsche owners are. If you
are going to get R1's, you should join Goodrich's Team TA plan. Track tires
are really cheap, around $130 each......but they don't last long. Usually
around 10 track hours if you really push them.

I did the same thing in my nissaan this winter at about 2 mph in my driveway.
I hit the garage and knocked it off the slab.  luckily I wasn't in

garage only moved about an inch and nothing fell on the real car.  I spent

Subject: 87 911 speedo

I have an 87 911 with an erratic speedo. It behaves as follows: When the car is
cold -no speedo. As the car warms up the speedo comes on and then functions
normaly until it is shut off and cools down for more than 1/2 hour. The warm up
time required to get the speedo operating has been increasing over the past few
months. Cruise control does operate but only when the speedo is "on".I have
tested the speedo "Haines" style by hooking up a test meter at the connection in
the access compartment in the back seat and in fact the speedo needle did jump.
Someone has suggested that the speedo needle is "sticky " and reccomended that I
open up the speedo and lube the needle shaft. I wonder if somehow the electric
sender in the tranny is faulty? Has anyone heard of a similar situation?

Subject: 914 Speedo Cable Failures

Hi Porschephiles,
Fellow PCA member with 74 914 has had the speedo cable break about 1 to 2
inches inside the cable housing just forward of the angle drive.  This is the
third occurance, at the same place.  Previous fixes included:  new angle
drive unit, 2 new speedo cable units plus the original (to him-had the car 6
months), and he had speedo completely rebuilt.  All done by a repair shop, so
he tells me.  Claims there are no binding turns in the cable.  First and
subsequent failures gave no warning, no noise, no needle wobble, etc.  

I have replaced the entire assembly from angle drive to the speedo on my 73
914 and had the speedo head rebuilt, but have not seen or heard of repeat
failures after replacing all that.  Any thoughts?

All help appreciated, especially by Walt.

Thanks,

1. Check that your insurance covers you, let the company know.
2. Full pre-flight your car including, oil, water, tyres, battery
   and especially brakes.
3. Check that all overmats and other loose objects are removed or secured.
4. Wear appropriate shoes and clothing.
5. Make sure your helmet fits properly and complies with local regs.
6. Listen up at the drivers briefing and do exactly as you instructor
   says.
7. In a Porsche on the track it should be possible to keep your hands
   at the 10:10 position all the way around, steering needs to come
   from your arms and upper body movement rather than feeding the wheel
   through as you may have been taught for road driving.
8. Complete all your braking before you get to the turn-in!
9. Observe the line and turn in that the other drivers in front take.
10. Have fun, your Porsche was made for this!

I don't know what Texas World Speedway is like, but the first time
I drove my 911 on a track it was on the Silverstone GP circuit before
the more recent modifications. Very, very, very fast and pretty scary
experience. All the turns looked the same at first, I really needed
the instructor.

EH is what the name says.  They use a (patented) putty-like substance as a 
matrix to hold abrasive.  The process works on anything that acts as a pipe.
They put the part in a jig, force the abrasive putty through it, and, Voila!
a pipe with a larger, smooth, interior surface area that will now flow more
fluid (gasses are fluids).  More flow, more good stuff.  I don't know anyone
who has tried it, but lots of rags have reported on the process.

'nother problem (this car has only put on 125 miles or so in the past two

on the first blink. On the second blink and each one after, both turn 
signal indicators (those things up top of the tach) blink each time. 
Outside, only the correct side blinks (ie. right turn, right side blinks, 
left turn, left side blinks).

I'm guessing that somewhere in the mess of wires, both are touching, or 
something electrical is going wrong. Anyone know how to fix this, and is 
there a way to do it without removing the tach? Oh, BTW, the stereo amp

Once watched the same thing happening, in this case, people could see the

turned and slid and crunched and pushed each other into the canal at the

In the end there were 7 crunched cars, including 2 pushed completely into

Babak asks:
Hello all:
Getting ready to change the cartridges for the front shocks in my
early 85 944.  Any advice, tips, horror stories anyone?
Babak Marefat

Here are my experiences ...

Tools you'll need:
Spring compressor
large pipe wrench
jack stands
19 or 17mm socket to loosen wheel caliper

Start by lifting car, take wheel off. Remove brake caliper. I think I also
removed rotor by loosening c-clamp at hub. Use a hex bit.

I did some time ago, please bear with me... Hang brake caliper with a piece
of wire, don't let it dangle by the hose. Compress spring, loosen bolt that
attaches a-arm to strut assembly. Loosen top nut at strut bearing. Might be
a good idea to check/clean upper strut bearing. I replaced mine at 90K or so...

TO loosen top nut I used a 22mm? socket and a hex bit. Pass the hex bit through
the the socket and use a pipe wrench to turn socket. Ruins the chroming on the
socket, but it gives it character, (also makes it easy to find ). I think there
is a special tool for that. This method has worked well on my old GTI, my 300D
,my 911 and the 944. 

THe strut assembly will drop out. Once out, remove spring (no need to undo 
compressor). Use large pipe wrench to loosen collar. Remove strut insert.
I bought Bilsteins and they included a new collar and a wrench that fits it.
Some people recommend adding a few tablespoons of oil to the inside of the
strut assembly to help with heat transfer. 

Put everything back together the way it came out...Repack wheel bearings, if you
like and adjust until the washer can be barely moved with a screw driver.
HAve the car aligned...Enjoy! My right shock was so bad, that it would bottom
and bounce every time I hit a bump.

I might have left minor details out. It is not hard. Use a good 6 point socket
to loosen the brake caliper bolts. They might be frozen (just ask Steve J :)
Might help to have a friend to hold the strut down while you use the large
pipe wrench to loosen collar. I did it myelf.

Hope this helps!

Subject: flashing and waving



911 drivers here on the East coast usually flash or wave and
there is virtually no snobbery toward older cars. If anything
C-2,4 and 930 drivers seem to get a kick out of seeing early
911's on the road. I've even flashed early 70's VW beetles that
were the same in-your-face yellow.

Never had any luck flashing other flavors of P-cars because it
takes them so long to, how shall I say? *get it up* that I was a
mile down the road. ;-)

Also, after some mistaken cases of mistaken identity where I
flashed Mazdas or Nissans I gave up on the waterlogged p-cars.

Its probably a bad earth.

If you cannot find the bad earth, I suggest you check for poor grounding.

Failing that check for corroded wiring connectors where they connect to 
the car body....

If all else fails take it to your local auto electrician who will take 
$550.25 and return the car with one headlight not working and a story 
about having to replace a faulty alterwatsit. 

He probably found the corroded terminal after 10 mins, but he does have 
to feed the kids!!

Go on get stuck in head under the dash, feet sticking out the windows - 
nose blocked cos you have a cold.

Don't ever moan about Lucas wiring, at least the switches fell to bits 
before the connectors corroded up.

Gladly.  Porsches are German-made antidotes to boredom and an excess of
financial resources.  All that it has been my pleasure to observe closely
have shared *superb* handling and brakes, great power/weight ratio, assembly to 
incredibly high build-quality standards, and very high market value.

They come in many flavors: 6 cylinder, air-cooled, rear-mounted engines behind 
the driven rear wheels (as God and Dr. Porsche intended... say, it just occurs 
to me that I've never seen God and Dr. Porsche *together* at the same time; you 
don't suppose....) and both 4- and 8-cylinder, front-mounted, rear driven, water
cooled engines.

There are definitely things that one can engage in that are more pleasurable
than owning and driving a Porsche, but they generally require the removal of
clothing and the participation of another person, preferably of another gender
(from my perspective, in any event...)

Now that I've satisfied your request, may I make one of you?  Would you please
send me large quantities of money?  Thank you.

I have zilch experience with 911's, much less with an 
erratic speedo, but I did have a similar problem with my
84 928.  

On my car there is a printed circuit foil on the back of the
instrument cluster.  All inputs are routed to the
instruments via circuits on the foil.  The input for the 
speedo is connected to the speedo mechanism by a little
pin on the foil.  The connection from the foil to the pin
is by a *rivet* !!  No kidding!  

Apparently, they can't create a solder joint because it
would melt the foil.  The signal level from the sensor on 
the tranny is probably in the millivolt region and therefore
a mechanical connection via the rivet could easily fail if
the rivet isn't tight.  Sure enough, the rivet on my car was
slightly loose and everything cleared up after I squeezed
it flat with a large channel lock pliers.  

If it's possible to wiggle the circuit foil while the rear tires
are turning (dangerous if you're driving the car, better if
you jack it up and block it safely) you might be able to
get some activity out of the needle ... if so, it probably is
worth taking things apart to check the electrical 
connections.

Again, I realize this pertains only to my 928 and may not
apply to your car, but what the heck?!

Good luck!

Sorry in that case.

Jon, I had the same aspect when I bought my 911 1990-C2 Targa
a month ago. 
Only the C2(90-) and the C4(89-) has the ABS brakes.
I think the same is true for the air bags, but I'm not 100%.

And then I have something for the list.
* When I cold start I usually have to try 3 times, this
is not good for the start engine. The mechanic has looked at
it, he replaced the O2 sensor and a heat sensor, but it did
not help. The car idles fine once it has started, and there
is no problem if the car is started on a warm day.

* Also the horn does not work but when I set the alarm off, the horn
goes off, I've checked the fuse. What should I do next, replace the relay?

* The Targa top is fine, little wind noise, and almost completely dry
when it rains hard, but it squeaks annoyingly in one corner. I don't want
to rebuild the whole top, is there any small fix I could do?

And maybe all new list members should start getting the digest instead,
then they wouldn't drown in all incoming mail, this way we wouldn't
have as many mail saying unsubscribe me or similar.....
Just one opinion.

Well gang, the restoration is nearly complete.  The engine has been

my batteries and muffler.  

The weather around here is getting much better, so I would really like
to crank it over and take it for a spin.  Just dumped 9.5 qts of
oil in it last night.  As I was putting in the second to last quart,
my wife came out to the garage and said, "This looks serious, your
actually putting fluids back in, let me get the camera!".
Of course this was right after her usual "Is it done yet?"

I have not completed the body resto yet, as I plan to leave that till next
winter, when the car is stuck back in the garage.  However, I have
removed all the rust and performed all the necessary body work.  Whats
left is paint, all new rubber, and new trim pieces.

Bottom line on this project, that is over a year in the making, I could
not have gotten this far and had this much confidence that everything
is right, had it not been for this list.  It's not just the questions
that have been posted by me, but all the other info I've gleened
from interloping.

Special thanks to Bob Spindle, Pete, Trond, and of course the "The

Subject: Cam Adjustment?

My mechanic tells me that he can get me a substantial performance increase
in the 60-100 mph range by adjusting the cam timing.  Currently, engine
comes on at about 3800 rpm he says that by adjusting the cams he can lower
this to about 3200 rpm, thereby giving me increased performance at a lower
rpm.  BTW, I own an 87 Carrera.  All I loose, other than $600, is some top
end speed.  I do much of my driving in the 3k rpm range and I wouldn't mind
having the performance the engine has at the higher rpm in this range.  My
questions are:

Is this for real?

Are there any other things I am sacraficing other than the top end speed and
cash?  Perhaps lower engine life?

$600 seems like a lot of money, around ten hours of labor. Is this really
what it will take?

Any comments appreciated.  You can email direct at jaironf@pacbell.com.

I had a similar problem with my speedo a while back.  It turned out to be the
sender (I didn't know it was in the tranny).  My mechanic tells me it is 
a fairly common problem.

Only good thing about it, the odometer wasn't working when the speedo
wasn't working.  I wasn't sure whether to fix it :-)  But being followed
by a cop for 10 miles with no idea how fast I was going convinced me
it would probably be wise to get it fixed.   (I hear telling the judge your
speedo is broken is good for getting the speeding ticket AND a ticket
for faulty equipment.)

Good Luck with getting it fixed,

My father, who had a 928 at the time, pointed out that the car they 
drive around in is a 928S, but the car that goes into the lake is a 
928.  The driver had S wheels, the 'U-boat' had phone-dials.

Only-vaguely-related-note:

I had a dream last week that I was driving my old Datsun wagon.  I 
kept pushing the pedal harder, but nothing was happening--the car was 
slow as molases.  I kept thinking how awful it was compared to the 
911.  Finally, in disgust, I pulled over, got out and started 
walking.

Porsche. There is NO substitute...

When I think of this, two things come to mind:

    1) _I_ would have never let that 928 get near the water
       like that wimp Cruise did.

    2) My '86 928 had custom plates when I bought it.  They had
       the following:

    	    NOSBT2

       Which I and many others had difficulty decoding.  (I have since
       replaced the plates, so any Oregon pfiles out there can call
       the DMV and make this combo their own.)

My '68 912 behaved just like that ... for a while, because it did that only
while on the road at mid-to-high rpms (never in the driveway).  Finally
(after someone here suggested a bad ground connection to someone else whose
car did this only under low-voltage conditions) I took all the signal
lights off, reseated all the wire connections, reseated the bulbs, and
tried it out:  no more trouble.  No analysis, not much understanding
gained, but try it and good luck!

Subject: Flashing


This thread brings back a memory or two.....In the early 70's I had a 62 Super 
90 Cpe, red of course and 356 types in Southern New England were fairly rare. 
So, people flashed the hell out of each other from opposite directions, 
passsing, etc.  Nice atmosphere of camaraderie.  Problem was that people (not 
just Porsch types but everyone)would flash oncoming cars after passing a cop 
on the side of the road to warn them of possible radar traps, or just fuzz 
lurking in wait. 
 
Rhode Island even passed a law making it illegal to warn oncoming cars of 
police presence in this fashion.   You can probably guess most of the rest.... 
 Flashed another 356 after passing a b&w a mile or so back, was spotted by a 
b&W  that was not far behind the car I flashed and he did a very aggressive U 
turn to pull me over.  Smilingly explained the nature of my gesture to the 
officer but got no where.  I think my post Viet Nam attitude caused me to say 
something like "F**k you then, write the ticket".  This led to furthur 
escalation, intense physical activity, escalated legal charges and a night in 
the local jail.  I  had to explain it to the judge who had no sympathy. "If 
you can afford a Porsche you can afford the fine".  He probably drove a Buick. 
 
Anyway, I still flash 356's from the B cpe and 911's when in the 911.  356 
people are very friendly and will even make U turns for a better look.  The 
911 types are less so, preferring to respond only when flashed by a car that 
is of equal or greater perceived value than the one they're driving.  I 
haven't quite figured out the etiquette of it all but usually don't hesitate 
to be the first flasher.

I can beat that.  In my old 914, if you left your foot on the brake pedal
while you turned the ignition off, the car would continue to run.  It would
die as soon as you took your foot off the pedal.

BTW my flashers exhibit the same double blinking symptom.  I suspect the
22-year-old flasher unit, but it blinks the light fine on the outside so
I haven't felt like investing $50 or whatever it costs to find out for sure.

"clip in" eventually.  I  REALLY regret selling this vehicle, and I hope 
you folks can forgive me, my finances were hellish but the car deserved 
better...
	Anyway he has a bunch of basket case 914s lying around, the most 
interesting is one that I thought was a 914/6.  It has fender flares 
which are fiberglass and had an opposed six in it.  I asked about it and 
it turns out someone had slapped a CORVAIR engine in it!!!???  Is this 
conversion common and/or fast?  The car is rusted to death but you can 
tell someone once spent a lot of money on it, like leather upholstery, 
WIDE minilite style wheels, wild looking suspension, etc.  The shop owner 
doesn't know its history, he bought it with the shop some eight years 
ago.  He thinks it might be an original 914/6 because of its early build 
date (11/69) and its uplevel interior and tougher looking suspension.  
His question and mine...how do you tell a 914/4 from a 914/6?  Are the 
VIN #s different?  Suspensions?  Any info would be helpful.

I think it's a difference between Porsche enthusiasts who pride
themselves on their older cars, on upgrading them for performance
and/or preserving them for concours, and people who buy new Porsches
for any number of reasons, including the desire to show the world that
they can afford them.  Buyers of expensive cars often do so in pursuit
of exclusivity, which mitigates against admitting marque camaraderie.  

This reflects (appropriate word) on a problem PCA has had in
recruiting members among buyers of new Porsches--or more precisely,
people who buy new Porsches who have never owned a Porsche before.  It
has also made the relationship between Porsche dealers and PCA regions
often less than salutary, as their respective goals have diverged.

I hope this makes you feel better about living in a place where
a Japanese made Toyota Camry costs about as much as a 911 in America.

Let me know how much the RSR costs in Australia. I bet I
could buy an RSR in Europe, ship it piece-by-piece via air mail,
and weld and bolt it back together for less! I could even register
it with one of Stan's '69 911T serial numbers in his desk!

By the way, we can buy RSR's here no problem, (At least the 911 GT-2
twin turbo) but they are not legal on the streets, only for racing.
These race cars are probably not street legal anywhere in the world.
If they are, we would like to know where!

my fraternirt in college had it's own bmw !  A 2002i that had been to the
moon and was on it's way back !  When I first drove it the actual yelled
at my because I shifted before passing redline.

anyway - turn on the wipers and the turn signals would flash in random
patterns.  If you hit the brakes hard, the horn would come on and stay
on till you hit the horn.  If you hit the horn and the wipers were off,
they'd come on.  Always started though.  If it was rainy out you
would progress down the street with all sorts of beeping and flashing
, what an amazing car.

we once had a party where everyone was given a colored magic marker and
invited to write on the car (which was white).  It was even more fun to
drive after that !

I had the same problem on my 67 911. It was a strange one, I found the problem
in the rear tail light area.  Bad ground, I took some sand paper and cleaned

Subject: Polishing wheels/Flashing

Hi:

Since we're in winter's icy grip in the NE, I'm getting around to those little
projects:

1. I have polished wheels with painted center caps. The paint on the center
caps is peeling and needs renewing.  I'd like to remove the silver paint 
and polish these to a high gloss to match my wheels and then repaint just the 
crest.  What is the best way to polish aluminium?  I have air tools, which 
would be fastest but least precise.  How about a Dremel tool or good ol' fine 
sandpaper?

2.  The current thread on flashing (i.e. one's lights) reminds me of a feature
I wish my car had: the ability to flash the driving lights.  When I first got 
the 944, I would yank the turn-signal lever out of reflex to flash someone.  
If the headlights are in the closed position, this doesn't do much good.  
This feature would have several uses:
	a. acknowledge other P-cars 
	b. warn oncoming traffic of speed-traps (3 quick flashes)
	c. flash the idiot poking along in the fast lane (reserved use only) 
	   or about to cut you off 

Since I'm upgrading the driving lights to 100W, now is a good time to do this.
 Has anyone done this, comments?

BTW, thanks for the responses on Extrude Honing.

>anymore, but what's a lightweight 356 doing in the heartland?  Where did it
>come from, and what did the owners do with it?  For that matter, what did YOU
>do with it?
 
The lightweight was bought by a U.S. Army captain and his German wife in
Munich, 1961. It was their second Porsche. They got moved back to the
states, I have pictures of the car at Ft. Hood, TX. He went to Green Beret
school, went to Vietnam, and was killed while advising the locals, May of
'65. At the time Vietnam was page 10 news (I have the clippings mentioning
his death, from NY Times, Washington Post, LA Times, SF Chronicle). Widow
had to 1) identify the body in Hawaii and 2) hustle self and kids off to
Germany to keep the U.S. Government from deporting her and keeping the kids.
Left car behind, his family took care of selling it. Went from Ohio to
Pennsylvania to Missouri to Illinois to Kansas to California, where I got
it.
 
What were the Green Beret and his wife doing with a lightweight in the first
place? I asked the widow. "Well, we went to a race at Watkins Glen while he
was TDY back in the states. We hung out with the Porsche factory team. Do
you know a Huschke von Hanstein? Well, he told us if we order another one
with the intention of rallying and hillclimbing, we should make sure he got
our order, he would put the non-catalog aluminum lids on it." I asked why it
had an extended steering column. The captain was 6foot something and needed
to have the seat all the way back, then have the wheel moved back to meet
him. They learned this from their first car. She also asked "is the racing
seat still in there?" No. "Are the red seat belts still in there?" Yes. "My
husband put those in." She remarried a U.S. Army officer, he's retired, they
live near Heidelberg, drive a 928 and we met a couple of years ago at
Hockenheim during a German Porsche Club event.
 
After driving it around the block and deciding it was unsafe/butchered by VW
Visigoths, I parked it pending a full restoration. I don't even want to get
into what else the "shop teacher" did to it, but fortunately it can all be
undone. It's going to take a cutting torch and grinding wheel though.

I flash my lights on streets [to say hi]  but not on the highway.
I figure nowadays even Porschephilers are more likely to interpret the

I have two 8x16" and two 9x16" Design 90 wheels for sale. The Design 90
wheel has 7 "spokes". The cutouts are like rounded triangles. I think
these were the standard wheel on most Porsches in the early 90s.

8"  PN# 964.362.116.01   offset: 52.5mm
9"  PN# 928.362.118.02   offset: 52.5mm

These were used exclusively on the track for 2 seasons (ie. no
curbsurfing). They have scuffs and scratches (I'm going to clean and
polish them tonight to get the extent). These will make excellent track
wheels and possibly good looking street wheels. I bought them from a
friend who used them on his C4. Another friend is using the same size on
his '86 951. The 9s fill up the rear fenders of the 928, however, the 8s
do not have the right offset for the front and problems could arise if
the car has been lowered or has weak springs.

I'm asking $1000 OBO and shipping from Dallas is also negotiable.

OK, Gang, Here it is!

The Account is in the name of PORSCHEPHILES (what else?)

Make your checks out to: PORSCHEPHILES, Acct. #3933150532
you already have the other bank info (you *did* save it, I know...)

PORSCHEPHILES already has $100 in the account, and will have $125 
by noon Sat, 2/18/95.  <vbg>  Nothing can stop us now!

Let me make a couple of suggestions for those not wildly enthusiastic
over the idea of the PCA/EFR business (the sound of non-US ears pricking up,
all over the world):

There's no reason we can't have it all.  Porschephiles exists.  We are
Porschephiles.  Some of us are also PCA or PCGB, or other, but we are all
still Porschephiles.  If I could only belong ot PCA or Porschephiles, sorry
PCA, but there'd be no contest.  I *am* a Porschephile first, last and always.

I also want to be a founding member of a new PCA Region, EFR, but I will
always be a Porschephile first and independently of how that works out.

*NO ONE HAS TO SEND A CENT*  On the other hand, those who do, should have
some recognition.  We owe Stan a debt that we can never pay, but we can
show our appreciation (as has already been discussed to death, <vbg>) by
lifting the financial burden off his shoulders, leaving him the control as
is his *well earned* right.

So on the levels of contribution issue, I suggest, as an initiation, $15 for 
students, $50 for regular members, $100 for Patrons.  send all checks to me
and I will keep a spreadsheet with the check number and amount (and the order
received.  I'm of mixed emotions on publishing the amounts with the names,
but I *will* publish the names of those from whom I have received donations.
If you let me know, via email or note with your check, I will publish the
amount of your donation; otherwise I will only publish the total in the fund
and the names of the guilty... er, *Contributors*

So, it's time to shi... er...defecate or vacate...  Talk to me.  Better,
send me money.

So, as the actress said to the bishop, "it been a business doing pleasure

I didn't mean to insult anyone. It's just that both the 944 and the 308 landed in the 
hands of non-enthusiasts much more than other cars by the respective companies.

>The Ferrari 308 (did you mean GT4, GTB, GTS or GTO?) is a great vehicle The
>GTO  at 400 BHP and 180mph is a car I would love to have. 

I don't put the 308 in the same breath as a GTO. I've put a good number of miles on an 
'82 308GTB, and it was NOT a very nice car - truthfully, I wish it wasn't a Ferrari. It 
was an early fuel-injected model, which had weird problems, and smog pumps, and it 
wasn't a Quattrovalvole (those began in... '83? '84?). I like the 328 quite a bit though - 
much better, though quite similar.

>Please insult me some more.

Naw, I wouldn't do that. :)
I should rephrase my statement, in a more verbose way:
If you see someone coming out of a 356 or early 911, there's a good chance that that 
person is an enthusiast, and a fairly knowledgable Porsche fan.
If you see someone coming out of a Ferrari Dino (a friend of mine just sold his '72, 
leaving him with only his '69... Whatta car! Factory knock-off wheels, Daytona seats, 
etc, etc... Beeeeeeoooteeefooool.) or a 250GT, chances are that it's an enthusiast and a 
knowledgable Ferrari fan.

However, if you see someone coming out of a 944, there is a far less chance that they 
are an enthusiast. Ditto for a 308. The cars were marketed more towards the young, 
affluent type as something to drive to work, rather than a sports car to blast down the 
back roads. And, not to be a snob, but I hate the idea of a sports car being driven exactly 
the same way that a luxury car or family care would be driven.

Fred-

Sounds like you have the cylinders installed, and the cam 
towers all mounted on the heads.  Now you want to bolt 'em 
together.  You believe the left bank has the cam correctly 
placed for #1 to be at TDC, and I assume, although you 
haven't said it, that you believe the right hand cam is aligned 
such that it is in the position it should be when #1 is at TDC.  
Lot of believing and assuming going on here.

Someone once observed a "flashing" incident while I was piloting, um, a
different brand of german metal, and remarked "just lift two fingers
above the wheel, that's what the Porsche drivers do... no need for a
light show".  Since she had impeccable taste (other than dating me) and
was accomplished in a variety of activities, I gave her words careful
consideration, and have my confined myself to this salute ever since.
Unless I just passed a radar trap, in which case deserving oncoming

Subject: SAVE - Porschephiles Account info -

OK, Gang, Here it is!

The Account is in the name of PORSCHEPHILES (what else?)

Make your checks out to: PORSCHEPHILES, Acct. #3933150532
you already have the other bank info (you *did* save it, I know...)

PORSCHEPHILES already has $100 in the account, and will have $125 
by noon Sat, 2/18/95.  <vbg>  Nothing can stop us now!

Let me make a couple of suggestions for those not wildly enthusiastic
over the idea of the PCA/EFR business (the sound of non-US ears pricking up,
all over the world):

There's no reason we can't have it all.  Porschephiles exists.  We are
Porschephiles.  Some of us are also PCA or PCGB, or other, but we are all
still Porschephiles.  If I could only belong ot PCA or Porschephiles, sorry
PCA, but there'd be no contest.  I *am* a Porschephile first, last and always.

I also want to be a founding member of a new PCA Region, EFR, but I will
always be a Porschephile first and independently of how that works out.

*NO ONE HAS TO SEND A CENT*  On the other hand, those who do, should have
some recognition.  We owe Stan a debt that we can never pay, but we can
show our appreciation (as has already been discussed to death, <vbg>) by
lifting the financial burden off his shoulders, leaving him the control as
is his *well earned* right.

So on the levels of contribution issue, I suggest, as an initiation, $15 for 
students, $50 for regular members, $100 for Patrons.  send all checks to me
and I will keep a spreadsheet with the check number and amount (and the order
received.  I'm of mixed emotions on publishing the amounts with the names,
but I *will* publish the names of those from whom I have received donations.
If you let me know, via email or note with your check, I will publish the
amount of your donation; otherwise I will only publish the total in the fund
and the names of the guilty... er, *Contributors*

So, it's time to shi... er...defecate or vacate...  Talk to me.  Better,
send me money.

So, as the actress said to the bishop, "it been a business doing pleasure
with you!"

I didn't mean to insult anyone. It's just that both the 944 and the 308 landed in the 
hands of non-enthusiasts much more than other cars by the respective companies.

>The Ferrari 308 (did you mean GT4, GTB, GTS or GTO?) is a great vehicle The
>GTO  at 400 BHP and 180mph is a car I would love to have. 

I don't put the 308 in the same breath as a GTO. I've put a good number of miles on an 
'82 308GTB, and it was NOT a very nice car - truthfully, I wish it wasn't a Ferrari. It 
was an early fuel-injected model, which had weird problems, and smog pumps, and it 
wasn't a Quattrovalvole (those began in... '83? '84?). I like the 328 quite a bit though - 
much better, though quite similar.

>Please insult me some more.

Naw, I wouldn't do that. :)
I should rephrase my statement, in a more verbose way:
If you see someone coming out of a 356 or early 911, there's a good chance that that 
person is an enthusiast, and a fairly knowledgable Porsche fan.
If you see someone coming out of a Ferrari Dino (a friend of mine just sold his '72, 
leaving him with only his '69... Whatta car! Factory knock-off wheels, Daytona seats, 
etc, etc... Beeeeeeoooteeefooool.) or a 250GT, chances are that it's an enthusiast and a 
knowledgable Ferrari fan.

However, if you see someone coming out of a 944, there is a far less chance that they 
are an enthusiast. Ditto for a 308. The cars were marketed more towards the young, 
affluent type as something to drive to work, rather than a sports car to blast down the 
back roads. And, not to be a snob, but I hate the idea of a sports car being driven exactly 
the same way that a luxury car or family care would be driven.

Sounds like you have the cylinders installed, and the cam 
towers all mounted on the heads.  Now you want to bolt 'em

placed for #1 to be at TDC, and I assume, although you 
haven't said it, that you believe the right hand cam is aligned 
such that it is in the position it should be when #1 is at TDC.  
Lot of believing and assuming going on here.

One way to see if things are roughly correct is to check the 
position of the indents on the ends of the camshafts.  Both 
ought to be pointing approximately straight up when the 
heads are positioned for mounting.  If they pass that test, you 
ought to be OK.  It means #1 and #4 are set properly, and all 
the rest then fall into place.

Then you can do as you state, put #1 at TDC and mount the 
heads.  For peace of mind, before you mount them, you might 
want to look at those  cylinders whose valves are extended at the 
moment, and  check that the corresponding piston is somewhere 
down in the bore where it won't hit the valves.  It should be.

I don't remember this part exactly, but on my engine (don't know 
if they're all this way) there wasn't enough span in the chains to,

1) slip them over the camshafts once the heads were bolted down,

2) or slip them over the sprocket and get the sprocket on once the 
heads were bolted down, or,

3) both of the above.  

So just be sure you check this part before you compress those nice 
new headgaskets. :-) Also, tighten the headbolts progressively and 
give the cam a turn after each tightening sequence.  If the cam 
binds, try another sequence.

I don't have the exact dates for the Watkins Glen dates. Perhaps I'll give them a

grab one there. Either way, I'll find out.
And to answer the other questions:
Yes, you can camp anywhere you like. (I stuffed the 914 full of camping stuff and 
stayed in the "woods" by the back straight. They start qualifying early-early - it 
was great to awaken to the sounds of racing motors at 7:30am! I swear, I could 
LIVE there. :)
I dunno about showers. I figure I can go one night without a shower - not like I 
was sweating, it was COLD there! (And me with no heater! Brr.)
As for cars, not TOO many Ferraris. There was a 275 last year, a 250LM the 
year before, and plenty of 308s, 328s, Testarossas, etc just driving around. There 
are a ZILLION Porsches, almost all 356s. Tons of MGs... A couple Aston Martins. 
Lots of weird old hard-to-identify stuff. I have a zillion pictures, a couple of 
which are on the computer - I plan on putting this year's pictures on Photo CD 
as well as print, so I can make JPeGs out of 'em and distribute them.
Anyways, Watkins Glen is the only "real" sports car track I've been to, but from 
what I've seen on the boob tube, it's definetely one of the nicer ones. I find it 
quite beautiful... And a nice drive for me. (About two hours of back roads.)

>BTW, any info on the big Porsche swap meet in PA?  

I don't know anything about them, except what others have told me.

Hi, all,

    My favorite flashing incident happened on a backroad of NH (which we were 
just informed has a law against it, BTW).  I was driving my beat up ol' '76 
Alfa Romeo Sprint Veloce  (i.e., an Alfetta GT for non-'76 models).  Going
down a sleepy road on my way to a conference on Lake Winnipisauke (sp?), when
I started noticing an inordinate number of Alfa Spyders going the other way.
Started wondering what was going on.  Then, around a curve came a MINT '59 (?)
Alfa Guilia -- and HE flashed ME!!!  I was thrilled!  Never did find out what
the Alfa "swarm" was about, though.
    Of course, this was the same trip that I discovered how thoughtful Italian
engineering can be.  Upon departing said sleepy backwoods NH town, discovered
that the engine would not start because the A/C compressor had seized.  Well,
I'll just cut the belt, I thought.  Nope!  In Milan they put the A/C where the
alternator should be, and piggyback the alternator off of the A/C pulley!!
Took a little while to rip out the A/C, remount the alternator in its rightful
place (which mounts to an exhaust stud!!), and finally to convince the auto
parts store (for replacement belt) that my car did NOT have A/C :^)  
   Do you think we P-philes could start a flashing fad?  Might ruin us 911
driver's high-beam switches, though :^(   At least the 914 guys got the sturdier
VW switch!

Hello, gang,

   I recently saw an otherwise forgettable movie that had *tons* of 911's. It
was called "No Man's Land," and it "starred" Charlie Sheen.  It was about a
ring of thieves who only stole Porsches!  Lots of gorgeous cars and some good
driving scenes.  Only problem was the chase scenes:  The anti-heroes had stolen
a 930, but were being chased by the "real" bad guys, a rival car theft ring.
The bad guys were in some big '80's Mercury sedan, and an IROC Z, but the Merc'
was keeping up!!  It was ridiculous; the 930 would come screaming around a 
corner in an insane, heel-toe, four-wheel drift, and then the Merc' would 
fishtail around the same corner, and then the Detroit Iron would start gaining

Subject: RE: PCA vs PCX vs List

Hi all,

It seems that the driving force behind being affiliated with PCA(X) is
economic.

The Tax benefits of becoming a Non-Profit organization are worthy of
considerations. But do we have to be under Porsche Club of America, AG or
whatever? 

Why not start our own Porsche special interest group? There are many Porsche
Clubs out there like Porsche Owners Club, 356 Registry, 914 Owners
Associations etc. that have Non-Profit Tax Status. We could start the first
Porschephiles Club or some other applicable name. 

In California, most PCA regions are Non-Profit Corporations. They are treated
individually as Non-Profit entities by the government. All income has to
follow the Non-Profit guidelines of the Fed & State, but that's it! As long
as the purpose stated behind the Non-Profit application is accepted and
adhered to by the club, you are treated as a non-profit group.

Some of the discussion has raised concerns over geographical boundaries and
P-Car ownership. Creating our own Porsche Enthusiasts Club would let us
decide how the club is operated, dues and set own membership guidelines.

I think there are some very creative folks on this list. If we wanted to
pursue this avenue we need to accumulate the Non-Profit laws for each state
of the US to determine which one has the best opportunities for our group.
Merchandising considerations would be determined by the Non-Profit law we
would be under. 

In California, some PCA regions are having difficulties with the State
Non-Profit Authorities over Member vs. Non-Member income. One of the reasons
we are having these problems, is the way PCA is structured. Regions are
separately governed entities under a large umbrella. Other car clubs are not
encountering the same problems because there membership is "Under" one
governing body.

Don't get me wrong, I have been a member of PCA for many years. I enjoy PCA
and have been very active in the local region (Orange Coast Region) for over
15 years. I would support an EFR region as a Dual member, if we felt this was
our best alternative.

That is my $0.10 (inflation). I understand the reasons for wanting to
affiliate with PCA. But I also think it may be prudent to explore becoming a
separate Non-Profit club.

First off, follow the advice Ben Evans gave you -- the pre-event tech will
check most  of the safety items too.  And secondly, relax a bit.  TWS is a
very safe track as tracks go.  If we even hold the event (not NEAR enough
registered drivers right now) I'll be one of the instructors and Sally will
be doing laps in our "new" '84.

Just as a small example of how safe TWS is, I was instructing there a year
or so back and we exited the course at about 80 mph (not on purpose, mind
you) -- I just told the driver (as calmly as one can when siting in their
own p_ss) to drive straight and slow down e-a-s-y (which we did), there was
no damage to the car at all as TWS has lots of runout room on most all
corners.  This was with VERY spirited driving on the advanced student's
part, and I don't think you should worry too much about it.  Most all the
instructors up there WILL NOT let you get in over your head (I know I
won't).

What makes this an even cuter story, is that Sally was my student and it was
OUR car she was driving...

You'll have a blast.  I'd also highly suggest you come out to some of our
autocrosses which will teach you the same skills but at slower and safer
speeds.  (in fact *I* think it should be a prerequisite of high speed event
attendance)...

Rich's curt message was not called for, he would have received much better

difficult for newcomer's, is that it takes a couple month's to become

Subject: 911 cam timing

We did a good bit of dyno testing many years ago at AutoThority (when 
they did that sort of thing.) 

First, the general rule of thumb is that advancing the cam timing helps 
low-end, retarding the cam timing accentuates the top-end. SC's, although 
always supplied with the same cams, went through several different cam 
timing specs.

One other note: the factory typically sets cam timing in the middle of 
the published "acceptable" range. After the chains break-in, they have 
stretched a bit and retarded the cam timing.

Anyway, yes, advancing the cams will help mid-range performance. Not  
a great deal, but some. No numbers for you, but I can say I talked to many 
people who had it done and felt it was worthwhile. We usually shot for 
1.55mm.

Geeze, *WHAT* am I thinking of... I sent Jeff a note about my old
Nash that required you to hold the foot on the brake to start it,
but forgot *CLEAN* about the true Car From Hell -- The Chasemobile!

This is (was? never know...) a Saab 99 of dubious vintage that had a
special hole crafted in the dash directly in front of the passenger's
left shoulder. The job of the passenger was to peer through the hole from
time to time to see if the car had caught fire yet, and if so, to
blow out the flame by exhaling rapidly and frequently through same said
hole...

The owner, despite being a good friend of mine and *way* high up on
the genius scale, never seemed interested in a fix. He continued to live
with this "work-around" until he finished grad school and passed the car
on to his brother who was just entering grad school at the same hallowed
institution. Best of my knowlege, the car never got fixed.

No, Dave Barry had *NOTHING* to do with this, despite a vague similarity
in overall outlook, and living in reasonable proximity to the owner's 
parents...

I'm not so sure that there has to be a difference between buyers of new
Porsches and owners of old Porsches.    

I just bought my first Porsche (new) this week, and must say that I'm
really looking forward to some on-the-road cameraderie.  Before buying the
Porsche, I had a 94 RX-7 (which I still enjoy), but there is something
different about a Porsche.  From the time you walk into the dealership you
realize that there more to Porsches than other cars -- there's a history
and a level of craftsmenship that you just don't see anywhere else.

Most PCA regions which are close to "race tracks" have porsche time

car.

I would start with a autocross school first and a couple of atuocross 
them move on up to the race track events. 

The race tracks can be a little intimidating the first time out.

I was not meaning to imply that there were no Porsche enthusiasts

It's less of an automatic conclusion these days, that's all.  And the

Back in the '60s you had to be careful to catch the eye of oncoming drivers;
otherwise, they tended to fixate on the 356 to the extent that they drifted

sideswiped (or hit head-on).  Flashing them usually broke the trance.

For 914 owners who are looking for that "different sort of flash",  you know,
the one that sets you apart from all those "normal" 914 flashers, try pulling
the switch out and back in as fast as you can.
If you do it just right you will raise and lower just one headlight instead
of both effectively winking at the oncoming p-car.  It takes a bit of
practice to be able to do it right every time, but the look on the flashees

One way to see if things are roughly correct is to check the 
position of the indents on the ends of the camshafts.  Both 
ought to be pointing approximately straight up when the 
heads are positioned for mounting.  If they pass that test, you 
ought to be OK.  It means #1 and #4 are set properly, and all 
the rest then fall into place.

Then you can do as you state, put #1 at TDC and mount the 
heads.  For peace of mind, before you mount them, you might 
want to look at those  cylinders whose valves are extended at the 
moment, and  check that the corresponding piston is somewhere 
down in the bore where it won't hit the valves.  It should be.

I don't remember this part exactly, but on my engine (don't know 
if they're all this way) there wasn't enough span in the chains to,

1) slip them over the camshafts once the heads were bolted down,

2) or slip them over the sprocket and get the sprocket on once the 
heads were bolted down, or,

3) both of the above.  

So just be sure you check this part before you compress those nice 
new headgaskets. :-) Also, tighten the headbolts progressively and 
give the cam a turn after each tightening sequence.  If the cam 
binds, try another sequence.

I don't have the exact dates for the Watkins Glen dates. Perhaps I'll give them a

And to answer the other questions:
Yes, you can camp anywhere you like. (I stuffed the 914 full of camping stuff and 
stayed in the "woods" by the back straight. They start qualifying early-early - it 
was great to awaken to the sounds of racing motors at 7:30am! I swear, I could 
LIVE there. :)
I dunno about showers. I figure I can go one night without a shower - not like I 
was sweating, it was COLD there! (And me with no heater! Brr.)
As for cars, not TOO many Ferraris. There was a 275 last year, a 250LM the 
year before, and plenty of 308s, 328s, Testarossas, etc just driving around. There 
are a ZILLION Porsches, almost all 356s. Tons of MGs... A couple Aston Martins. 
Lots of weird old hard-to-identify stuff. I have a zillion pictures, a couple of 
which are on the computer - I plan on putting this year's pictures on Photo CD 
as well as print, so I can make JPeGs out of 'em and distribute them.
Anyways, Watkins Glen is the only "real" sports car track I've been to, but from 
what I've seen on the boob tube, it's definetely one of the nicer ones. I find it 
quite beautiful... And a nice drive for me. (About two hours of back roads.)

Hi, all,

    My favorite flashing incident happened on a backroad of NH (which we were 
just informed has a law against it, BTW).  I was driving my beat up ol' '76 
Alfa Romeo Sprint Veloce  (i.e., an Alfetta GT for non-'76 models).  Going
down a sleepy road on my way to a conference on Lake Winnipisauke (sp?), when
I started noticing an inordinate number of Alfa Spyders going the other way.
Started wondering what was going on.  Then, around a curve came a MINT '59 (?)
Alfa Guilia -- and HE flashed ME!!!  I was thrilled!  Never did find out what
the Alfa "swarm" was about, though.
    Of course, this was the same trip that I discovered how thoughtful Italian
engineering can be.  Upon departing said sleepy backwoods NH town, discovered
that the engine would not start because the A/C compressor had seized.  Well,
I'll just cut the belt, I thought.  Nope!  In Milan they put the A/C where the
alternator should be, and piggyback the alternator off of the A/C pulley!!
Took a little while to rip out the A/C, remount the alternator in its rightful
place (which mounts to an exhaust stud!!), and finally to convince the auto
parts store (for replacement belt) that my car did NOT have A/C :^)  
   Do you think we P-philes could start a flashing fad?  Might ruin us 911
driver's high-beam switches, though :^(   At least the 914 guys got the sturdier
VW switch!

Hello, gang,

   I recently saw an otherwise forgettable movie that had *tons* of 911's. It
was called "No Man's Land," and it "starred" Charlie Sheen.  It was about a
ring of thieves who only stole Porsches!  Lots of gorgeous cars and some good
driving scenes.  Only problem was the chase scenes:  The anti-heroes had stolen
a 930, but were being chased by the "real" bad guys, a rival car theft ring.
The bad guys were in some big '80's Mercury sedan, and an IROC Z, but the Merc'
was keeping up!!  It was ridiculous; the 930 would come screaming around a 
corner in an insane, heel-toe, four-wheel drift, and then the Merc' would 
fishtail around the same corner, and then the Detroit Iron would start gaining 
on the Zuffenhausen alloy.  Ahh, Hollywood.

Why not start our own Porsche special interest group? There are many Porsche
Clubs out there like Porsche Owners Club, 356 Registry, 914 Owners
Associations etc. that have Non-Profit Tax Status. We could start the first
Porschephiles Club or some other applicable name. 

In California, most PCA regions are Non-Profit Corporations. They are treated
individually as Non-Profit entities by the government. All income has to
follow the Non-Profit guidelines of the Fed & State, but that's it! As long
as the purpose stated behind the Non-Profit application is accepted and
adhered to by the club, you are treated as a non-profit group.

Some of the discussion has raised concerns over geographical boundaries and
P-Car ownership. Creating our own Porsche Enthusiasts Club would let us
decide how the club is operated, dues and set own membership guidelines.

I think there are some very creative folks on this list. If we wanted to
pursue this avenue we need to accumulate the Non-Profit laws for each state
of the US to determine which one has the best opportunities for our group.
Merchandising considerations would be determined by the Non-Profit law we
would be under. 

In California, some PCA regions are having difficulties with the State
Non-Profit Authorities over Member vs. Non-Member income. One of the reasons
we are having these problems, is the way PCA is structured. Regions are
separately governed entities under a large umbrella. Other car clubs are not
encountering the same problems because there membership is "Under" one
governing body.

Don't get me wrong, I have been a member of PCA for many years. I enjoy PCA
and have been very active in the local region (Orange Coast Region) for over
15 years. I would support an EFR region as a Dual member, if we felt this was
our best alternative.

That is my $0.10 (inflation). I understand the reasons for wanting to
affiliate with PCA. But I also think it may be prudent to explore becoming a
separate Non-Profit club.

First off, follow the advice Ben Evans gave you -- the pre-event tech will
check most  of the safety items too.  And secondly, relax a bit.  TWS is a
very safe track as tracks go.  If we even hold the event (not NEAR enough
registered drivers right now) I'll be one of the instructors and Sally will
be doing laps in our "new" '84.

Just as a small example of how safe TWS is, I was instructing there a year
or so back and we exited the course at about 80 mph (not on purpose, mind
you) -- I just told the driver (as calmly as one can when siting in their
own p_ss) to drive straight and slow down e-a-s-y (which we did), there was
no damage to the car at all as TWS has lots of runout room on most all
corners.  This was with VERY spirited driving on the advanced student's
part, and I don't think you should worry too much about it.  Most all the
instructors up there WILL NOT let you get in over your head (I know I
won't).

What makes this an even cuter story, is that Sally was my student and it was
OUR car she was driving...

You'll have a blast.  I'd also highly suggest you come out to some of our
autocrosses which will teach you the same skills but at slower and safer
speeds.  (in fact *I* think it should be a prerequisite of high speed event
attendance)...

Rich's curt message was not called for, he would have received much better
responses if he had been polite. It was obivously out of frustration and to a
newcomer this list can be a bit intimidating.

In time, you get to know the personalities and take things in stride. What is
difficult for newcomer's, is that it takes a couple month's to become
"involved". I have heard the same complaint from new member's of a PCA
region. "The people are cliquish". They are not, but that is the apperance.

If you are a newcomer to the list, Be Patient. 
If you feel your questions have not been heard - Be Polite! 
Curt messages will yeild curt messages.

Subject: 911 cam timing

We did a good bit of dyno testing many years ago at AutoThority (when 
they did that sort of thing.) 

First, the general rule of thumb is that advancing the cam timing helps 
low-end, retarding the cam timing accentuates the top-end. SC's, although 
always supplied with the same cams, went through several different cam 
timing specs.

One other note: the factory typically sets cam timing in the middle of 
the published "acceptable" range. After the chains break-in, they have 
stretched a bit and retarded the cam timing.

Anyway, yes, advancing the cams will help mid-range performance. Not  
a great deal, but some. No numbers for you, but I can say I talked to many 
people who had it done and felt it was worthwhile. We usually shot for 
1.55mm.

Geeze, *WHAT* am I thinking of... I sent Jeff a note about my old
Nash that required you to hold the foot on the brake to start it,
but forgot *CLEAN* about the true Car From Hell -- The Chasemobile!

This is (was? never know...) a Saab 99 of dubious vintage that had a
special hole crafted in the dash directly in front of the passenger's
left shoulder. The job of the passenger was to peer through the hole from
time to time to see if the car had caught fire yet, and if so, to
blow out the flame by exhaling rapidly and frequently through same said
hole...

The owner, despite being a good friend of mine and *way* high up on
the genius scale, never seemed interested in a fix. He continued to live
with this "work-around" until he finished grad school and passed the car
on to his brother who was just entering grad school at the same hallowed
institution. Best of my knowlege, the car never got fixed.

No, Dave Barry had *NOTHING* to do with this, despite a vague similarity
in overall outlook, and living in reasonable proximity to the owner's 
parents...

I just bought my first Porsche (new) this week, and must say that I'm

Porsche, I had a 94 RX-7 (which I still enjoy), but there is something
different about a Porsche.  From the time you walk into the dealership you

Most PCA regions which are close to "race tracks" have porsche time 
trials, driving schools. These are the best for learning to drive YOUR 
car.

I would start with a autocross school first and a couple of atuocross 
them move on up to the race track events. 

The race tracks can be a little intimidating the first time out.

I was not meaning to imply that there were no Porsche enthusiasts
buying new cars.  Indeed, probably a significant percentage of new
Porsche owners are aficionados of the marque.  I was one once myself;
now both my car and I are older.

It's less of an automatic conclusion these days, that's all.  And the
fact that I can flash the lights in my Cherokee in the same fashion

otherwise, they tended to fixate on the 356 to the extent that they drifted

For 914 owners who are looking for that "different sort of flash",  you know,
the one that sets you apart from all those "normal" 914 flashers, try pulling
the switch out and back in as fast as you can.
If you do it just right you will raise and lower just one headlight instead
of both effectively winking at the oncoming p-car.  It takes a bit of

The Account is in the name of PORSCHEPHILES (what else?)

Make your checks out to: PORSCHEPHILES, Acct. #3933150532
you already have the other bank info (you *did* save it, I know...)

PORSCHEPHILES already has $100 in the account, and will have $125 
by noon Sat, 2/18/95.  <vbg>  Nothing can stop us now!

Let me make a couple of suggestions for those not wildly enthusiastic
over the idea of the PCA/EFR business (the sound of non-US ears pricking up,
all over the world):

There's no reason we can't have it all.  Porschephiles exists.  We are
Porschephiles.  Some of us are also PCA or PCGB, or other, but we are all
still Porschephiles.  If I could only belong ot PCA or Porschephiles, sorry
PCA, but there'd be no contest.  I *am* a Porschephile first, last and always.

I also want to be a founding member of a new PCA Region, EFR, but I will
always be a Porschephile first and independently of how that works out.

*NO ONE HAS TO SEND A CENT*  On the other hand, those who do, should have
some recognition.  We owe Stan a debt that we can never pay, but we can
show our appreciation (as has already been discussed to death, <vbg>) by
lifting the financial burden off his shoulders, leaving him the control as
is his *well earned* right.

So on the levels of contribution issue, I suggest, as an initiation, $15 for 
students, $50 for regular members, $100 for Patrons.  send all checks to me
and I will keep a spreadsheet with the check number and amount (and the order
received.  I'm of mixed emotions on publishing the amounts with the names,
but I *will* publish the names of those from whom I have received donations.
If you let me know, via email or note with your check, I will publish the
amount of your donation; otherwise I will only publish the total in the fund
and the names of the guilty... er, *Contributors*

Typically I'll wave at other Porsche drivers on the road though I think
this friendly greeting is losing some favor.  Typically drivers of older
Porsches will acknowlege with a wave or flash, with newer Porsches, ya can
never tell; some wave and some just drive past.  Still, I enjoy the

Hello,
	YES, YES, YES!!!  I love that movie!  I had forgotten it!  I 
believe it was a Corvette that got torched :^) .  My exploding 924 was 
on the TV show Hunter though.  Does anybody know what the name of that 
movie was?  Also, remember Doc Hollywood's Speedster?  Sure, it was 
probably a replica, but its the thought that counts.  When 
Michael J Fox's mechanic rebuilt the engine (which wasn't even damaged 
when he ran into the fence) he had a box of parts left over!  Some of us 
can certainly relate to that!
	Somebody should make a list of the best Porsche movies and mail 
it to the list.  Any volunteers?

I didn't mean to insult anyone. It's just that both the 944 and the 308 landed in the 
hands of non-enthusiasts much more than other cars by the respective companies.

>The Ferrari 308 (did you mean GT4, GTB, GTS or GTO?) is a great vehicle The
>GTO  at 400 BHP and 180mph is a car I would love to have. 

I don't put the 308 in the same breath as a GTO. I've put a good number of miles on an 
'82 308GTB, and it was NOT a very nice car - truthfully, I wish it wasn't a Ferrari. It 
was an early fuel-injected model, which had weird problems, and smog pumps, and it 
wasn't a Quattrovalvole (those began in... '83? '84?). I like the 328 quite a bit though - 
much better, though quite similar.

>Please insult me some more.

Naw, I wouldn't do that. :)
I should rephrase my statement, in a more verbose way:
If you see someone coming out of a 356 or early 911, there's a good chance that that 
person is an enthusiast, and a fairly knowledgable Porsche fan.
If you see someone coming out of a Ferrari Dino (a friend of mine just sold his '72, 
leaving him with only his '69... Whatta car! Factory knock-off wheels, Daytona seats, 
etc, etc... Beeeeeeoooteeefooool.) or a 250GT, chances are that it's an enthusiast and a 
knowledgable Ferrari fan.

However, if you see someone coming out of a 944, there is a far less chance that they 
are an enthusiast. Ditto for a 308. The cars were marketed more towards the young, 
affluent type as something to drive to work, rather than a sports car to blast down the 
back roads. And, not to be a snob, but I hate the idea of a sports car being driven exactly 
the same way that a luxury car or family care would be driven.

Subject: Fred's Heads


Fred-

Sounds like you have the cylinders installed, and the cam 
towers all mounted on the heads.  Now you want to bolt 'em 
together.  You believe the left bank has the cam correctly 
placed for #1 to be at TDC, and I assume, although you 
haven't said it, that you believe the right hand cam is aligned 
such that it is in the position it should be when #1 is at TDC.  
Lot of believing and assuming going on here.

One way to see if things are roughly correct is to check the 
position of the indents on the ends of the camshafts.  Both 
ought to be pointing approximately straight up when the 
heads are positioned for mounting.  If they pass that test, you 
ought to be OK.  It means #1 and #4 are set properly, and all 
the rest then fall into place.

Then you can do as you state, put #1 at TDC and mount the 
heads.  For peace of mind, before you mount them, you might 
want to look at those  cylinders whose valves are extended at the 
moment, and  check that the corresponding piston is somewhere 
down in the bore where it won't hit the valves.  It should be.

I don't remember this part exactly, but on my engine (don't know 
if they're all this way) there wasn't enough span in the chains to,

1) slip them over the camshafts once the heads were bolted down,

2) or slip them over the sprocket and get the sprocket on once the 
heads were bolted down, or,

3) both of the above.  

So just be sure you check this part before you compress those nice 
new headgaskets. :-) Also, tighten the headbolts progressively and 
give the cam a turn after each tightening sequence.  If the cam 
binds, try another sequence.

I don't have the exact dates for the Watkins Glen dates. Perhaps I'll give them a

grab one there. Either way, I'll find out.
And to answer the other questions:
Yes, you can camp anywhere you like. (I stuffed the 914 full of camping stuff and 
stayed in the "woods" by the back straight. They start qualifying early-early - it 
was great to awaken to the sounds of racing motors at 7:30am! I swear, I could 
LIVE there. :)
I dunno about showers. I figure I can go one night without a shower - not like I 
was sweating, it was COLD there! (And me with no heater! Brr.)
As for cars, not TOO many Ferraris. There was a 275 last year, a 250LM the 
year before, and plenty of 308s, 328s, Testarossas, etc just driving around. There 
are a ZILLION Porsches, almost all 356s. Tons of MGs... A couple Aston Martins. 
Lots of weird old hard-to-identify stuff. I have a zillion pictures, a couple of 
which are on the computer - I plan on putting this year's pictures on Photo CD 
as well as print, so I can make JPeGs out of 'em and distribute them.
Anyways, Watkins Glen is the only "real" sports car track I've been to, but from 
what I've seen on the boob tube, it's definetely one of the nicer ones. I find it 
quite beautiful... And a nice drive for me. (About two hours of back roads.)

>BTW, any info on the big Porsche swap meet in PA?

Hi, all,

    My favorite flashing incident happened on a backroad of NH (which we were 
just informed has a law against it, BTW).  I was driving my beat up ol' '76 
Alfa Romeo Sprint Veloce  (i.e., an Alfetta GT for non-'76 models).  Going
down a sleepy road on my way to a conference on Lake Winnipisauke (sp?), when
I started noticing an inordinate number of Alfa Spyders going the other way.
Started wondering what was going on.  Then, around a curve came a MINT '59 (?)
Alfa Guilia -- and HE flashed ME!!!  I was thrilled!  Never did find out what
the Alfa "swarm" was about, though.
    Of course, this was the same trip that I discovered how thoughtful Italian
engineering can be.  Upon departing said sleepy backwoods NH town, discovered
that the engine would not start because the A/C compressor had seized.  Well,
I'll just cut the belt, I thought.  Nope!  In Milan they put the A/C where the
alternator should be, and piggyback the alternator off of the A/C pulley!!
Took a little while to rip out the A/C, remount the alternator in its rightful
place (which mounts to an exhaust stud!!), and finally to convince the auto
parts store (for replacement belt) that my car did NOT have A/C :^)  
   Do you think we P-philes could start a flashing fad?  Might ruin us 911
driver's high-beam switches, though :^(   At least the 914 guys got the sturdier
VW switch!

Hello, gang,

   I recently saw an otherwise forgettable movie that had *tons* of 911's. It
was called "No Man's Land," and it "starred" Charlie Sheen.  It was about a
ring of thieves who only stole Porsches!  Lots of gorgeous cars and some good
driving scenes.  Only problem was the chase scenes:  The anti-heroes had stolen
a 930, but were being chased by the "real" bad guys, a rival car theft ring.
The bad guys were in some big '80's Mercury sedan, and an IROC Z, but the Merc'
was keeping up!!  It was ridiculous; the 930 would come screaming around a 
corner in an insane, heel-toe, four-wheel drift, and then the Merc' would 
fishtail around the same corner, and then the Detroit Iron would start gaining 
on the Zuffenhausen alloy.  Ahh, Hollywood.

Subject: RE: PCA vs PCX vs List

Hi all,

It seems that the driving force behind being affiliated with PCA(X) is
economic.

The Tax benefits of becoming a Non-Profit organization are worthy of
considerations. But do we have to be under Porsche Club of America, AG or
whatever? 

Why not start our own Porsche special interest group? There are many Porsche
Clubs out there like Porsche Owners Club, 356 Registry, 914 Owners
Associations etc. that have Non-Profit Tax Status. We could start the first
Porschephiles Club or some other applicable name. 

In California, most PCA regions are Non-Profit Corporations. They are treated
individually as Non-Profit entities by the government. All income has to
follow the Non-Profit guidelines of the Fed & State, but that's it! As long
as the purpose stated behind the Non-Profit application is accepted and
adhered to by the club, you are treated as a non-profit group.

Some of the discussion has raised concerns over geographical boundaries and
P-Car ownership. Creating our own Porsche Enthusiasts Club would let us
decide how the club is operated, dues and set own membership guidelines.

I think there are some very creative folks on this list. If we wanted to
pursue this avenue we need to accumulate the Non-Profit laws for each state
of the US to determine which one has the best opportunities for our group.
Merchandising considerations would be determined by the Non-Profit law we
would be under. 

In California, some PCA regions are having difficulties with the State
Non-Profit Authorities over Member vs. Non-Member income. One of the reasons
we are having these problems, is the way PCA is structured. Regions are
separately governed entities under a large umbrella. Other car clubs are not
encountering the same problems because there membership is "Under" one
governing body.

Don't get me wrong, I have been a member of PCA for many years. I enjoy PCA
and have been very active in the local region (Orange Coast Region) for over
15 years. I would support an EFR region as a Dual member, if we felt this was
our best alternative.

That is my $0.10 (inflation). I understand the reasons for wanting to
affiliate with PCA. But I also think it may be prudent to explore becoming a
separate Non-Profit club.

First off, follow the advice Ben Evans gave you -- the pre-event tech will
check most  of the safety items too.  And secondly, relax a bit.  TWS is a
very safe track as tracks go.  If we even hold the event (not NEAR enough
registered drivers right now) I'll be one of the instructors and Sally will
be doing laps in our "new" '84.

Just as a small example of how safe TWS is, I was instructing there a year
or so back and we exited the course at about 80 mph (not on purpose, mind
you) -- I just told the driver (as calmly as one can when siting in their
own p_ss) to drive straight and slow down e-a-s-y (which we did), there was
no damage to the car at all as TWS has lots of runout room on most all
corners.  This was with VERY spirited driving on the advanced student's
part, and I don't think you should worry too much about it.  Most all the
instructors up there WILL NOT let you get in over your head (I know I
won't).

What makes this an even cuter story, is that Sally was my student and it was
OUR car she was driving...

You'll have a blast.  I'd also highly suggest you come out to some of our
autocrosses which will teach you the same skills but at slower and safer
speeds.  (in fact *I* think it should be a prerequisite of high speed event
attendance)...

Rich's curt message was not called for, he would have received much better

In time, you get to know the personalities and take things in stride. What is
difficult for newcomer's, is that it takes a couple month's to become

region. "The people are cliquish". They are not, but that is the apperance.

If you are a newcomer to the list, Be Patient. 
If you feel your questions have not been heard - Be Polite!

The Account is in the name of PORSCHEPHILES (what else?)

Make your checks out to: PORSCHEPHILES, Acct. #3933150532
you already have the other bank info (you *did* save it, I know...)

PORSCHEPHILES already has $100 in the account, and will have $125 
by noon Sat, 2/18/95.  <vbg>  Nothing can stop us now!

Let me make a couple of suggestions for those not wildly enthusiastic
over the idea of the PCA/EFR business (the sound of non-US ears pricking up,
all over the world):

There's no reason we can't have it all.  Porschephiles exists.  We are
Porschephiles.  Some of us are also PCA or PCGB, or other, but we are all
still Porschephiles.  If I could only belong ot PCA or Porschephiles, sorry
PCA, but there'd be no contest.  I *am* a Porschephile first, last and always.

I also want to be a founding member of a new PCA Region, EFR, but I will
always be a Porschephile first and independently of how that works out.

*NO ONE HAS TO SEND A CENT*  On the other hand, those who do, should have
some recognition.  We owe Stan a debt that we can never pay, but we can
show our appreciation (as has already been discussed to death, <vbg>) by
lifting the financial burden off his shoulders, leaving him the control as
is his *well earned* right.

So on the levels of contribution issue, I suggest, as an initiation, $15 for 
students, $50 for regular members, $100 for Patrons.  send all checks to me
and I will keep a spreadsheet with the check number and amount (and the order
received.  I'm of mixed emotions on publishing the amounts with the names,
but I *will* publish the names of those from whom I have received donations.
If you let me know, via email or note with your check, I will publish the
amount of your donation; otherwise I will only publish the total in the fund
and the names of the guilty... er, *Contributors*

So, it's time to shi... er...defecate or vacate...  Talk to me.  Better,

Subject: 924 Torch Movie and Doc Hollywood

Hello,
	YES, YES, YES!!!  I love that movie!  I had forgotten it!  I 
believe it was a Corvette that got torched :^) .  My exploding 924 was 
on the TV show Hunter though.  Does anybody know what the name of that 
movie was?  Also, remember Doc Hollywood's Speedster?  Sure, it was 
probably a replica, but its the thought that counts.  When 
Michael J Fox's mechanic rebuilt the engine (which wasn't even damaged 
when he ran into the fence) he had a box of parts left over!  Some of us 
can certainly relate to that!
	Somebody should make a list of the best Porsche movies and mail 
it to the list.  Any volunteers?

I didn't mean to insult anyone. It's just that both the 944 and the 308 landed in the 
hands of non-enthusiasts much more than other cars by the respective companies.

>The Ferrari 308 (did you mean GT4, GTB, GTS or GTO?) is a great vehicle The
>GTO  at 400 BHP and 180mph is a car I would love to have. 

I don't put the 308 in the same breath as a GTO. I've put a good number of miles on an 
'82 308GTB, and it was NOT a very nice car - truthfully, I wish it wasn't a Ferrari. It 
was an early fuel-injected model, which had weird problems, and smog pumps, and it 
wasn't a Quattrovalvole (those began in... '83? '84?). I like the 328 quite a bit though - 
much better, though quite similar.

>Please insult me some more.

Naw, I wouldn't do that. :)
I should rephrase my statement, in a more verbose way:
If you see someone coming out of a 356 or early 911, there's a good chance that that 
person is an enthusiast, and a fairly knowledgable Porsche fan.
If you see someone coming out of a Ferrari Dino (a friend of mine just sold his '72, 
leaving him with only his '69... Whatta car! Factory knock-off wheels, Daytona seats, 
etc, etc... Beeeeeeoooteeefooool.) or a 250GT, chances are that it's an enthusiast and a 
knowledgable Ferrari fan.

However, if you see someone coming out of a 944, there is a far less chance that they 
are an enthusiast. Ditto for a 308. The cars were marketed more towards the young, 
affluent type as something to drive to work, rather than a sports car to blast down the 
back roads. And, not to be a snob, but I hate the idea of a sports car being driven exactly 
the same way that a luxury car or family care would be driven.

Subject: Fred's Heads


Fred-

Sounds like you have the cylinders installed, and the cam 
towers all mounted on the heads.  Now you want to bolt 'em 
together.  You believe the left bank has the cam correctly 
placed for #1 to be at TDC, and I assume, although you 
haven't said it, that you believe the right hand cam is aligned 
such that it is in the position it should be when #1 is at TDC.  
Lot of believing and assuming going on here.

One way to see if things are roughly correct is to check the 
position of the indents on the ends of the camshafts.  Both 
ought to be pointing approximately straight up when the 
heads are positioned for mounting.  If they pass that test, you 
ought to be OK.  It means #1 and #4 are set properly, and all 
the rest then fall into place.

Then you can do as you state, put #1 at TDC and mount the 
heads.  For peace of mind, before you mount them, you might 
want to look at those  cylinders whose valves are extended at the 
moment, and  check that the corresponding piston is somewhere 
down in the bore where it won't hit the valves.  It should be.

I don't remember this part exactly, but on my engine (don't know 
if they're all this way) there wasn't enough span in the chains to,

1) slip them over the camshafts once the heads were bolted down,

2) or slip them over the sprocket and get the sprocket on once the 
heads were bolted down, or,

3) both of the above.  

So just be sure you check this part before you compress those nice 
new headgaskets. :-) Also, tighten the headbolts progressively and 
give the cam a turn after each tightening sequence.  If the cam 
binds, try another sequence.

I don't have the exact dates for the Watkins Glen dates. Perhaps I'll give them a

grab one there. Either way, I'll find out.
And to answer the other questions:
Yes, you can camp anywhere you like. (I stuffed the 914 full of camping stuff and 
stayed in the "woods" by the back straight. They start qualifying early-early - it 
was great to awaken to the sounds of racing motors at 7:30am! I swear, I could 
LIVE there. :)
I dunno about showers. I figure I can go one night without a shower - not like I 
was sweating, it was COLD there! (And me with no heater! Brr.)
As for cars, not TOO many Ferraris. There was a 275 last year, a 250LM the 
year before, and plenty of 308s, 328s, Testarossas, etc just driving around. There 
are a ZILLION Porsches, almost all 356s. Tons of MGs... A couple Aston Martins. 
Lots of weird old hard-to-identify stuff. I have a zillion pictures, a couple of 
which are on the computer - I plan on putting this year's pictures on Photo CD 
as well as print, so I can make JPeGs out of 'em and distribute them.
Anyways, Watkins Glen is the only "real" sports car track I've been to, but from 
what I've seen on the boob tube, it's definetely one of the nicer ones. I find it 
quite beautiful... And a nice drive for me. (About two hours of back roads.)

>BTW, any info on the big Porsche swap meet in PA?

If it's cars you want to see, visit the Museo dell'automobile in Torino or

Hi, all,

    My favorite flashing incident happened on a backroad of NH (which we were 
just informed has a law against it, BTW).  I was driving my beat up ol' '76 
Alfa Romeo Sprint Veloce  (i.e., an Alfetta GT for non-'76 models).  Going
down a sleepy road on my way to a conference on Lake Winnipisauke (sp?), when
I started noticing an inordinate number of Alfa Spyders going the other way.
Started wondering what was going on.  Then, around a curve came a MINT '59 (?)
Alfa Guilia -- and HE flashed ME!!!  I was thrilled!  Never did find out what
the Alfa "swarm" was about, though.
    Of course, this was the same trip that I discovered how thoughtful Italian
engineering can be.  Upon departing said sleepy backwoods NH town, discovered
that the engine would not start because the A/C compressor had seized.  Well,
I'll just cut the belt, I thought.  Nope!  In Milan they put the A/C where the
alternator should be, and piggyback the alternator off of the A/C pulley!!
Took a little while to rip out the A/C, remount the alternator in its rightful
place (which mounts to an exhaust stud!!), and finally to convince the auto
parts store (for replacement belt) that my car did NOT have A/C :^)  
   Do you think we P-philes could start a flashing fad?  Might ruin us 911
driver's high-beam switches, though :^(   At least the 914 guys got the sturdier
VW switch!

Hello, gang,

   I recently saw an otherwise forgettable movie that had *tons* of 911's. It
was called "No Man's Land," and it "starred" Charlie Sheen.  It was about a
ring of thieves who only stole Porsches!  Lots of gorgeous cars and some good
driving scenes.  Only problem was the chase scenes:  The anti-heroes had stolen
a 930, but were being chased by the "real" bad guys, a rival car theft ring.
The bad guys were in some big '80's Mercury sedan, and an IROC Z, but the Merc'
was keeping up!!  It was ridiculous; the 930 would come screaming around a 
corner in an insanhe 
Northeast Region. (BTW, I found it thanks to Prodigy's Astranet site...

Subject: 911 cam timing

We did a good bit of dyno testing many years ago at AutoThority (when 
they did that sort of thing.) 

First, the general rule of thumb is that advancing the cam timing helps 
low-end, retarding the cam timing accentuates the top-end. SC's, although 
always supplied with the same cams, went through several different cam 
timing specs.

One other note: the factory typically sets cam timing in the middle of 
the published "acceptable" range. After the chains break-in, they have 
stretched a bit and retarded the cam timing.

Anyway, yes, advancing the cams will help mid-range performance. Not  
a great deal, but some. No numbers for you, but I can say I talked to many 
people who had it done and felt it was worthwhile. We usually shot for 
1.55mm.

Geeze, *WHAT* am I thinking of... I sent Jeff a note about my old
Nash that required you to hold the foot on the brake to start it,
but forgot *CLEAN* about the true Car From Hell -- The Chasemobile!

This is (was? never know...) a Saab 99 of dubious vintage that had a
special hole crafted in the dash directly in front of the passenger's
left shoulder. The job of the passenger was to peer through the hole from
time to time to see if the car had caught fire yet, and if so, to
blow out the flame by exhaling rapidly and frequently through same said
hole...

The owner, despite being a good friend of mine and *way* high up on
the genius scale, never seemed interested in a fix. He continued to live
with this "work-around" until he finished grad school and passed the car
on to his brother who was just entering grad school at the same hallowed
institution. Best of my knowlege, the car never got fixed.

No, Dave Barry had *NOTHING* to do with this, despite a vague similarity
in overall outlook, and living in reasonable proximity to the owner's 
parents...

Most PCA regions which are close to "race tracks" have porsche time

I would start with a autocross school first and a couple of atuocross

The race tracks can be a little intimidating the first time out.

It's less of an automatic conclusion these days, that's all.  And the

For 914 owners who are looking for that "different sort of flash",  you know,
the one that sets you apart from all those "normal" 914 flashers, try pulling

If you do it just right you will raise and lower just one headlight instead
of both effectively winking at the oncoming p-car.  It takes a bit of

Subject: RE: PCA vs PCX vs List

Hi all,

It seems that the driving force behind being affiliated with PCA(X) is
economic.

The Tax benefits of becoming a Non-Profit organization are worthy of
considerations. But do we have to be under Porsche Club of America, AG or
whatever? 

Why not start our own Porsche special interest group? There are many Porsche
Clubs out there like Porsche Owners Club, 356 Registry, 914 Owners
Associations etc. that have Non-Profit Tax Status. We could start the first
Porschephiles Club or some other applicable name. 

In California, most PCA regions are Non-Profit Corporations. They are treated
individually as Non-Profit entities by the government. All income has to
follow the Non-Profit guidelines of the Fed & State, but that's it! As long
as the purpose stated behind the Non-Profit application is accepted and
adhered to by the club, you are treated as a non-profit group.

Some of the discussion has raised concerns over geographical boundaries and
P-Car ownership. Creating our own Porsche Enthusiasts Club would let us
decide how the club is operated, dues and set own membership guidelines.

I think there are some very creative folks on this list. If we wanted to
pursue this avenue we need to accumulate the Non-Profit laws for each state
of the US to determine which one has the best opportunities for our group.
Merchandising considerations would be determined by the Non-Profit law we
would be under. 

In California, some PCA regions are having difficulties with the State
Non-Profit Authorities over Member vs. Non-Member income. One of the reasons
we are having these problems, is the way PCA is structured. Regions are
separately governed entities under a large umbrella. Other car clubs are not
encountering the same problems because there membership is "Under" one
governing body.

Don't get me wrong, I have been a member of PCA for many years. I enjoy PCA
and have been very active in the local region (Orange Coast Region) for over
15 years. I would support an EFR region as a Dual member, if we felt this was
our best alternative.

That is my $0.10 (inflation). I understand the reasons for wanting to
affiliate with PCA. But I also think it may be prudent to explore becoming a
separate Non-Profit club.

First off, follow the advice Ben Evans gave you -- the pre-event tech will
check most  of the safety items too.  And secondly, relax a bit.  TWS is a
very safe track as tracks go.  If we even hold the event (not NEAR enough
registered drivers right now) I'll be one of the instructors and Sally will
be doing laps in our "new" '84.

Just as a small example of how safe TWS is, I was instructing there a year
or so back and we exited the course at about 80 mph (not on purpose, mind
you) -- I just told the driver (as calmly as one can when siting in their
own p_ss) to drive straight and slow down e-a-s-y (which we did), there was
no damage to the car at all as TWS has lots of runout room on most all
corners.  This was with VERY spirited driving on the advanced student's
part, and I don't think you should worry too much about it.  Most all the
instructors up there WILL NOT let you get in over your head (I know I
won't).

What makes this an even cuter story, is that Sally was my student and it was
OUR car she was driving...

You'll have a blast.  I'd also highly suggest you come out to some of our
autocrosses which will teach you the same skills but at slower and safer
speeds.  (in fact *I* think it should be a prerequisite of high speed event
attendance)...

Rich's curt message was not called for, he would have received much better

In time, you get to know the personalities and take things in stride. What is
difficult for newcomer's, is that it takes a couple month's to become
"involved". I have heard the same complaint from new member's of a PCA
region. "The people are cliquish". They are not, but that is the apperance.

If you are a newcomer to the list, Be Patient. 
If you feel your questions have not been heard - Be Polite! 
Curt messages will yeild curt messages.

Subject: 911 cam timing

We did a good bit of dyno testing many years ago at AutoThority (when 
they did that sort of thing.) 

First, the general rule of thumb is that advancing the cam timing helps 
low-end, retarding the cam timing accentuates the top-end. SC's, although 
always supplied with the same cams, went through several different cam 
timing specs.

One other note: the factory typically sets cam timing in the middle of 
the published "acceptable" range. After the chains break-in, they have 
stretched a bit and retarded the cam timing.

Anyway, yes, advancing the cams will help mid-range performance. Not  
a great deal, but some. No numbers for you, but I can say I talked to many 
people who had it done and felt it was worthwhile. We usually shot for 
1.55mm.

Geeze, *WHAT* am I thinking of... I sent Jeff a note about my old
Nash that required you to hold the foot on the brake to start it,
but forgot *CLEAN* about the true Car From Hell -- The Chasemobile!

This is (was? never know...) a Saab 99 of dubious vintage that had a
special hole crafted in the dash directly in front of the passenger's
left shoulder. The job of the passenger was to peer through the hole from
time to time to see if the car had caught fire yet, and if so, to
blow out the flame by exhaling rapidly and frequently through same said
hole...

The owner, despite being a good friend of mine and *way* high up on
the genius scale, never seemed interested in a fix. He continued to live
with this "work-around" until he finished grad school and passed the car
on to his brother who was just entering grad school at the same hallowed
institution. Best of my knowlege, the car never got fixed.

No, Dave Barry had *NOTHING* to do with this, despite a vague similarity
in overall outlook, and living in reasonable proximity to the owner's 
parents...

I just bought my first Porsche (new) this week, and must say that I'm
really looking forward to some on-the-road cameraderie.  Before buying the
Porsche, I had a 94 RX-7 (which I still enjoy), but there is something
different about a Porsche.  From the time you walk into the dealership you
realize that there more to Porsches than other cars -- there's a history
and a level of craftsmenship that you just don't see anywhere else.

Most PCA regions which are close to "race tracks" have porsche time 
trials, driving schools. These are the best for learning to drive YOUR 
car.

I would start with a autocross school first and a couple of atuocross 
them move on up to the race track events. 

The race tracks can be a little intimidating the first time out.

I was not meaning to imply that there were no Porsche enthusiasts

now both my car and I are older.

It's less of an automatic conclusion these days, that's all.  And the

Back in the '60s you had to be careful to catch the eye of oncoming drivers;
otherwise, they tended to fixate on the 356 to the extent that they drifted

sideswiped (or hit head-on).  Flashing them usually broke the trance.

For 914 owners who are looking for that "different sort of flash",  you know,
the one that sets you apart from all those "normal" 914 flashers, try pulling
the switch out and back in as fast as you can.
If you do it just right you will raise and lower just one headlight instead
of both effectively winking at the oncoming p-car.  It takes a bit of

Why go to the trouble, he could have just used one color, and painted (VW)

Dear John:
       My most vivid memory of Sodium fires was a training film I saw when I
was at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, circa 1968 (the film must have been
made in the '50's.) A 1955 Chevy pick u p truck backs to the top of a cliff
overlooking a water-filled quarry. Two figure emerge, unhook the  tailgate
and push a chunk of sodium about a cubic foot or two over the edge of the
quarry. The  sodium block accelerates  as Newton doth state and splashes into
the water. A one or two second pause. Followed by a DRAMATIC EXPLOSION Yellow
flames big plumes of water, etc. Smaller chunks of sodium land outside the
plume and produce secondary explosions. More yellow flame, white smoke etc.
     A rather vivid demonstration- far removed from the cute little pops one
gets from the chunk of sodium from inside an Ate 3048 Sodium-filled exhaust
valve when dropped into the sink.

Subject: Safety, ABS, Air Bags etc.


Text item: Text_1

Chris was asking about the intro. date of alleged safety features, if the 89 C4 
I test drove last year was truly representative of the model it did not have air
bags, it did have ABS. 
Now to start a flame session: who in their right mind would want either?
The safest restraint you can have is a FIXED length seat belt properly adjusted 
and WORN. It can be tested every time you drive the car and can be visually 
inspected, you know it will work when you need it and you don't have to worry 
about it working when you don't need it. Air Bags are a totally unnecessary 
government imposition on those of us who take care and precautions, shades of 
Big Brother and over regulation. If they would leave well alone Darwin's Theory 
would prevail.
ABS is similar in that it adds an unknown quantity of failure modes with unknown
effects and unknown failure rates. As one who has to evaluate all of these 
factors on an almost daily basis for commercial airline equipment its easy to 
get paranoid about it but things that ain't there don't break, pun intended. 
Unless racing you should never be in the position of having to be at the limit 
of braking. If you are, you have failed to read the road and or the situation, 
and are not driving in the defensive mode needed to be a good citizen, i.e. like
most ignorant, selfish, inconsiderate and intolerant louts you get around these 
parts. Strong letter to follow........
If you are racing you probably have enough skill to do better than ABS any way.
Seriously there are several good books on driving skills, one of the best being 
Paul Frere's Sports Car and Competition Driving, recently updated and re issued 
I believe.
Bottom line save your money for something useful and quit believing all of these
TV ads.
One of the reasons I bought an 86 was because it DIDN'T have ABS and Bags, 
though I do confess I am still using the inertia reel belts. However they are 
testable and inspectable for every pre-flight.
Have fun, observe and drive safely.

Yeah I've driven TR6s, one was quite thrilling as it was one of the development 
cars for the Lucas fuel injection system, which if my memory is good was the 
precursor of the Bosche CIS. Car had much more power than standard machine but 
you had to carry a hammer in the tool kit as the fuel pump would quit at 
inappropriate moments, very easy to get sideways even in the dry when pump 
worked.
If my memory is correct Bosche took (i.e. licensed) the mechanical system from 
Lucas and Lucas later took the electronic from Bosche. There were many ties 
between the Companies dating back to the mid thirties.
Many people used to acknowledge the driver of a similar vehicle be it MGA/MGA 
TR/TR Morgan/Morgan or whatever but you dont see it any more. Lorry (truck) 
drivers always gave lots of information to other drivers too, like flashing 
lights for speed traps or to tell you it was clear to overtake, I suppose the CB
radio did away with that.

914/6 serial numbers begin "914x43xxxx". 914/4 numbers begin with
"47xxxxxxx".  The first x in the 6 serial number is the last digit of the
model year, ie. 0 for 1970 or 1 for 1971.

914/6's also had five bolt wheels and vented front disks.  Many 4's have had
this done so this method of telling them apart is not as good.

A firend of mine built two Corvair powered 914's.  Had reverse cams in them
so they would run backwards.  Had 40 IDA Webers like early 911's.  Both
burned to the ground because of carb fires, at the same location on the same
highway after he had been to the same parts store! Eerie!  He gave up and
bought a pristine 914/6 instead.  Eventually sold it because he kept having
nightmares about IT burning to the ground.

At the risk of a flame war, NOT!  Rent, or better yet, BUY Steve McQueen's
"LeMans".  This is the ultimate heart pounding Porshcephile flick with
Porsches in their natural element, the race track.  Porsche vs. Ferrari, and
Steve in a Porsche 917 at LeMans: what could be better?!! And while the film

It's my understanding that ABS will fail in such a way that while you may
lose the anti-lock, your normal braking won't be affected.  Does anyone know
if this isn't correct?

As for never being in a position of being at the limit of braking, have you
ever driven in a Northeast Winter?  Have you ever hit "black ice?"  It's
possible for one side of the car to have adequate traction while the other
side has far less.  This is an example of where ABS will probably do you
more good than being a professional driver.  The ABS will be able to cycle
the brakes on half the car far faster than you could ever pump them.

I need the net wisdom help on this one.  I have been looking to upgrade my

Bosch, DOT approved for the USA, stock units.  I ordered the H-5 units from
Automotion during their recent sale but what they sent me are the same units
I now have???

What's the scoop?  Did they screw up and or try to sell me the wrong item or,
as the guy on the phone says, the H-5's are used world wide, and are approved
by the DOT.  

Needless to say I sent the DOT units back and am now still stuck with the
weak inefficient low suction original units.  Incidently nowhere on the stock
units does it say H-5.  On numerous other P Cars with the H-4's the unit is
clearly identified as H-4.  If I do have the H-5 now, what is the net wisdom
on an upgrade?

The 914 in "The Rockford Files" was (if memory serves) orange rather than 
red (one of us needs to adjust our set) and a `74 or earlier since it had 
chrome bumpers rather than the big, black, rubber (ugly IMO) safety bumpers 
found on the `75-6's.  Were the chrome ones only on original cars until `72? 
 I can never remember.

It was the first car that Beth Davenport (played by Gretchen Corbett) had.

Yes, it seems to come up regularly. Something for the FAQ, perhaps?

Compiling would be hard - I think there must have been many

Yes, my wet-wagon will flash the driving lights when the headlamps are
down, but only if the switch that normally turn the driving lights on is in
the "off" position.

If memory and A&E serve me correctly, "Beth Davenport" also had a yellow
914 that I've seen.  The yellow one may have been a '75 but maybe not as it
had steel wheels.  I wasn't paying a lot of attention.  I have also seen
the other one too and I concur that it was orange (at least on my Sony

I didn't see the stuff sent to P-files about Russell, But I did attend
the school last December.  I recommend the school if you are interested
in open-wheel racing, heck even if you aren't, I had a blast.  The basic
course takes place in an older Formula Ford (2 liter Pinto engine) car. 
The car weights about 900 pounds and has a resonable power to weight
ratio.

The first day of the course involves getting suited up, then you get to
practice heel-toe downshifting (an art in itself, much easier to do in a
914 than a Forumla Ford IMO) and brakeing.  Day two begins with
cornering exercises followed by lapping in the afternoon.  Day three is
purely lapping.  You are allowed to pass other cars in certain sections
of the course (the longer straights).  If your class is good, you get to
drive the Formula Russell Cars (similar car, with slicks, wings and lots
more power) for your last lapping session.

If you do go, you will probably notice several things when you get back
into your Porsche:

1.  My "nimble" 914 felt like a extended cab longbed pickup when I got back
into it.  This feeling continued for almost 2 weeks.

2.  I appreciated even more the "race breeding" in my 914 (i.e. pedal
setup, drivers position, steering position, brakes (yes even 914 brakes).

3.  I can't wait to go back for the Advanced Course...(or I put money
down on a 911)

Subject: 911 Engine Removal

Hello, Porscephiles;
    Hi, all!  I'm attempting to remove the engine out of my 1983 Euro-spec
911 Targa but experiencing trouble with getting the car high enough for yhe
engine to be removed.  I'm not even sure where to put the jackstands to
support the rear.  My jackstands are almost at maximum height
when placed under the torsion bar ends that stick out on either side of the
brackets on the arm side.  The _floor jack_ is also nearly at max height when
jacking under the engine with a 2 x 4 and I still need the car higher in order
to clear the engine (possibly 6 more inches or a little more). I was wondering
how some of you out there have been removing your engines.  Is there another
place to put the jackstands (and floor jack) that does not require as much
height? Also, is it hard to separate the engine from the transmission (how
is this accomplished)?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  So far, I
have put the car back down on the ground and all that is left is to get the
car high enough and remove the mount bolts.
                            Thanks,
                             Gene

Subject: Re: 911 Engine Removal

After your car is at max height with jackstands take the jack and get a large
board such as a 2" x 6". Put that board under the floorpan of your car just
forward of the transmission and across the width of the car. Put your jack on
another board so that it is high enough to jack up the board that you have
across the car. Raise the car enough to drag out the engine. Obviously the
car will come off the jack stand during this procedure and that is OK.
Make sure you have a helper to observe and help steady the engine.
We just did this in the sands of Sebring during the Club Race weekend so it's
pretty fresh in my mind.

>Reponse to Neil who doesn't think ABS or airbags are necessary if you are a

Neil,
You have just got to be kidding. You can be the best driver in the world
(ever read about notable world class drivers wrecking their street cars) and
the potential for a mishap is always there. Do you slow down at every cross
street and check to make sure no one is running a light, stop sign, etc ? Did
you ever have anyone fall asleep and cross a median strip in front of you?
These thing can and do happen and you are going to get walloped, I don't care
who you are.
Secondly seat belts are fine but in a high speed mishap you are going to be
seriously injured whether you are wearing them or not. Trust me on this I
spent quite a bit of time in emergency rooms during my college years. Seat
belt injuries can be severe, but certainly not as severe as not wearing them.
Head and leg trauma, as well as thoracic damage are common.
Seat belts combined with air bags have a much greater safety margin. It
doesn't take a genius to figure out why.
ABS is the greatest. Why do you think that modern race cars use this system?
I am sure race drivers can threshold brake very well but the driver with ABS
has a clear advantage both on the course and on the street. Worst case
scenario is that the ABS will fail in which case you have normal brakes.
Please re think your position on these matters

Subject: re;airbags,abs

I agree with you that airbags are a "big brother" intrusion on our lives, one
unfortuneate side effect for us sports car owners is the lack of easily
transferable steering wheels at a moderate price.

However I totally disagree with you concerning abs, which I have in my 90
944S2 and feel it is a great improvement over non-=abs in most circumstances.
 In autocrossing it is far superior to non-abs cars to such an extent that we
in the Northeast Region of PCA refer to courses as abs and non-abs favored
courses, and I'm sure it is true most everywhere else.  There is no question
that the abs can threshold brake better and more consistantly than 99% of the
drivers.  But when it comes to track driving the jury is still out on the
effectiveness of abs,  although it will help you to not lock a wheel when
hard braking, this aspect is not as critical on a track as it is at an
autocross, plus most people are more conservative on the track (probably due
to the hard walls around them) so they do not threshold brake quite as often
or as deeply.  Now the one unknown and a hot topic here in the Northeast area
of the country, is how does an abs equipped car react in a spinning situation
where the car is traveling in a rearward direction?  Commonly held theory to
lock the brakes does not work (abs works in reverse too.), so what do you do
to slow the car down?  Currently a number of regions and the people at the
local BMW club are investigating this quandry. Once my car comes out of
storage I may do some experimentation to see if there is a safe and controllab
le way to slow a spinning car on the track.

I read in Autoweek that airbags are not "totally" unnecessary, but there
aren't exactly a panacea either.  Airbags don't increase the survivability of
an accident much over the use of seatbelts alone (from the NHTSA numbers -
not my opinion).  In fact the article made mention of the fact that airbags
had even been *responsible* for deaths in accidents that should have been
survivable in a few cases.

Airbags are designed, basically, for head-on collisions.  I have to believe
that
most head-on collisions are avoidable.

FWIW, I don't like "passive" seatbelts either, nor do I believe that man-made
CFCs are causing global warming, etc, blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda...:>)

You don't like the later-style bumpers? I find them far more attractive than the

big overriders - well, overriders look bad on ANY car, but especially on those.

Since you are rebuillding the car for your sunny day driver, authenticity shouldn't be your main concern, and one advice is; buy a '60-'66 Beetle, you will be able to use a lot of the parts you (might) be missing.

You should try getting a sound 356 or 912 engine, and a 356 tranny (if it is missing).

Hi, Mike,

In 1987 Porsche decided to redesign the oil/water intercooler near the air
filter, resulting in failures of the O-ring.  Keep an eye out for black scum
in your coolant reservoir or brown foam in your oil.

No other unusual problem areas...stay away from the automatic...

On the other hand, you may want to hold out for a 1988 model, 15 more
horsepower, and you may be able to locate one of the special edition cars 
(no sunroof, windup windows, lighter and quicker) which are autocrosser's
delights...

Oh, and, keep my number handy...  :-)

The first reply>
..............................................................................
......................
If your engine runs fine when cold but has a problem warm, I'd
look for something temperature related.  This could be an injector
o-ring or the intake manifold gasket.  You can test both for vacuum
leaks by dribbling tap water on them.  If, when you dribble it at a
particular place, the engine note changes, or you hear or see the
water being sucked into the intake, you've found a problem.

Could be an O2 sensor; they get slow with age.  However, if after
about three minutes of driving from dead cold, you do not have an
idle problem, I think the O2 sensor is probably not to blame.  That
is, if the problem doesn't surface until long after the cat has lit off
and the DME has started running closed loop, it is not the closed
loop that is causing the problem.
..............................................................................
......................

Thank you, Kevin, for the reply.  I tried these tests and am not sure what
I've found, but would like to share observations.

The car is up on stands after a 20min. test session.  From dead cold, with
the 02 sensor partially unscrewed (no exhaust leaking), I started the car.
 The 02 was then removed, no change in engine operation as far as I could tell
. I placed it back in and tried the same 15min (and some 2000-3000rpm idling)
later, no change in engine operation now either.  Has the car failed the O2
test?  Was I listening for the right audible changes (i.e. idle change,stumble
,etc)?  This problem does manifest itself after 3+ minutes.  Boosch engine
management isn't my forte and I would need elaboration on when "cat. lit off"
and "DME closed loop" occur. 
The water test, performed with fish tank tubing and a bucket, was negative.

The big observation comes at the 11th minute and 15th minute of operation.
 At the 11th, the car chugs/stumbles and flushes itself slightly over 1000rpm
and then settles back down to a nice steady 1000.  At the 15th, it
chuged/stumbled and stalled dead from idle.  Regular maintenance has been
performed properly (I thought for a minute it could be particle(s) in the
fuel system, but the filter is fresh).

I've heard of the O2 test before, but thought it not applicable here because
it usually leads to other performance problems such as poor throttle response
at the gas peddle.  That is not when this problem is occurring.  Am I wrong
in this assumption?

Hi, Jon

Removing the O2 sensor from the loop does not mean to remove it physically
from the exhaust system. It means to disconnect the electrical connection to
the DME.  In this case, the connection is a plug (about the size of a
jalapeno pepper) located near the firewall at the top of the motor.

Try the same tests with the sensor installed in the exhaust system, but with
the connection removed.

Of course, it could be one of the temperature sensors with a dead spot at
some point, which is causing the stumbling.

The last thing to be said is that the factory service manual contains a
detailed diagnosis and list of symptoms that might assist you in your quest.
If you're going to be working on your on 944, I HIGHLY recommend the
acquisition of the factory manual. (Porsche Factory Manual - there is no
substitute...)

Lastly, about your fuel filter being new and therefore good.  It was about 2
years ago when I finally found ($$$) a fuel filter had been clogged by a bad
tank of gas that kept my getting enough fuel at medium to high rpms.  The
fuel filter was 3 months old, the gas let me cruise home for 60 miles until
the symptoms occurred.

All that I am trying to point out is that you cannot make any assumptions
that a part is good until you have tested it.  Even then, you cannot always
be sure...

Good luck,

This sounds like a Freedom of Speech issue.  Years ago, I read a 
front-page article in the Hartford (Connecticut, USA) Courant about a 
guy who got a ticket for light flashing.  The court offered to drop the 
charge, but he persisted in order to force a judgement and thus a legal 
precedent.  He won, and in his argument, made reference to the earlier 
days when Paul Revere used lanterns in the Old North Church to warn of 
approaching British.  (Hope I recall my history fact right).

usually win the court fight, but it depends on the judge.  Best not to

Subject: Re: 1978 911 SC

I bought an 85 Targa this summer. In searching for the car, I extensively
searched for a 911 sc as well as a Carrera. The earliest car I saw was an 80
Coupe. The guy wanted 16k for it. I looked at several 81's and 82's at around
17k and an 83 cabriolet at 22k (this car was in a couple of really serious
accidents--didn't pass muster). If the car is as you say--it sounds like a
very competitively priced  car to me. Be sure to check whether there is a
chain tensioner upgrade. Have it checked out by a mechanic and, when driving
it, be on the watch for worn syncromesh in 1st and 2nd gears. Also, theres a
"pop off box" that needs a kit. One of the other guys with more tech
knowledge can tell you more about it--not sure I understand it. Oh yeah, a
leak down test is mandatory when being checked out mechanically. And, by the
way, I love my Targa, the top goes thru the car wash with just a trickle on
inside of the passenger window. And you can't beat the wind and air for the
price compared to a cabriolet.

Subject: 931 Fuel pump riddle.

Hi Porschephiles.
I am experiencing some weird problmes with my 924 Turbo - here is a
chronology of the events:
When I turn on the ignition and the pumps cycle on to pressurize the system,
I get a strange 'rattle' from the fuel pump area (near the tank).  This has
been the case since I bought the car several years ago.  When I start the
engine, I can still hear a noise from the back of the car.  I checked the
system pressure and it proved to be within spec - and my in-dash air/fuel
ratio guage shows full rich at wide open throttle.  I assumed therefore that
all was OK with the pump.
Today, the car started jerking when I accelerated.  The car would eventually
only go about 10MPH.  The 'rattle' from the back seemed to have intensified.
 I had the car towed home and installed a pump from my brothers 1979 924.
 This solved the jerking problem - BUT after driving a few miles, the 'rattle'
 from the back (either from one of the two pumps or the fuel accumulator) had
returned (!!!) - even with the enw pump.  I know that the noise is not coming
from the in-tank pump because I disconnected it and the noise remained.  Has
anyone ever experienced this?  
BTW, when I bought the car, the fuel accumulator had been removed (bypassed)
and I replaced it with a 2nd hand unit from "Best-Deal."  

Thnaks for your advice -
MIKE

Subject: Airbags - personal testimony


To those who question the usefulness of airbags: you're crazy!

Last November I was driving my 1985 Ford Tempo equipped with
an airbag (yes, '85 Tempo).  I was on the Columbus beltway approaching
a "cross-merge".  I needed to exit the highway right beyond an on-ramp.

Traffic was moderate, the road was lighted but dark at 7:45 pm; 
I looked back to make sure no one was merging on, when I looked forward, 
the car in front of me jammed the brakes and almost lost it.  His back end 
came out about 20 degrees and his front end took a serious dive.

I jammed the brakes and veered right onto the shoulder instinctively to
avoid him.  I thought I probably had room behind him, but veered right.

A split second later I found out why he jammed his brakes.  He was
also merging off to the right and was going to cut across the painted "V"
from the on-ramp, when at the last second he saw a parked car!

My attention was on his car, I didn't even see the parked car when I veered 
right I hit the parked car square at 35-45 mph.

After a loud pop, I realized what had happened.  I didn't hear any
squishy sounds and felt okay.  Jumped out of the car and was fine.

I admit the seat belt protected me from serious injury, but the airbag kept me
from whipping my head, kept me from being bruised by the seat belt alone,
kept me from going forward more than a couple inches off the seat,
and did a good job of making my wire rimmed glasses a pair of sport goggles!
Without the airbag, I could have suffered a neck injury, perhaps some
bruised ribs.

I just couldn't believe I was in such a serious accident and wasn't injured.
Maybe my accident could have been avoided, but then again, that's why
they're called accidents.  If a $1000 option is going to save me from injury
(especially during the few times I don't wear my seat belt), I call that 
CHEAP insurance.

Mike, your wife has good taste.

Look at the 924/944/968 FAQ for "things to look out for".  In particular,
check to see that it has the modified seals in the oil cooler.  If it has,
ask whether or not the lower bearings were also replaced (they should have
been).  Coolant in the oil can ACCELERATE bearing wear.

By the way, there were 500 of the Special Edition cars in 1988.

About a month ago I removed the "drug dealer" tinting from my Mercedes. It
was quite easy and only took about an hour. All you need is a spray bottle
full of ammonia, a razor blade and paper towels. 

On the roll-up windows, roll 'em down an inch or two to expose top corner of
tinting, get under it with the razor to lift it slightly, then spray a bit of
ammonia at where the tint is beginning to peel away and pull. If you're lucky,
the sheet will not rip. When you've got it pulled down as far as it will go,
roll the window back up and pull it the rest of the way off.

For the other windows, just find a corner, lift, spray, pull, spray, pull...

I tried to be especially careful with the defroster elements, pulling the
film off parallel to the lines and had no problems. 

Good luck!

From your answers, I learned that the cut-off wire is supposed to go to a spade connector on the

Instead of touting the low numbers as highly prestigious, you should tout
the 9-series numbers.  Just think of the prestige associated with having
911, 928, 944 etc...  Just think of the money collected as well :-)

Subject: Re: Airbags and ABS

Your points about "unnecessary" safety devices are dubious at best, for,
although what you write may be appropriate for you, I and the majority of
people on this list unfortunately dear old Aunt Minnie and millions like her
do not necessarily approach the task of driving with the same mind set, and
when she gets into a wreck lets hope an airbag saves her both for her sake
and for ours. Why?, because we are the ones that indirectly absorb the
additional costs of her extended hospitalization (due to lack of protection
in the vehicle) through increased insurance premiums. 

It's the same as the idiots, like Garey Busey, who refuse to wear helmets
when riding bikes because it "their freedom" not to do so. Well fine - but I
just hope he makes sure that he can afford to pay ALL the additional costs
for reconstructive surgery and life support after he smashes his skull on the
pavement 'cos I want no pay no part of "his freedom".

In this state (AZ), insurance companies severely reduce payouts on accidents
where they can prove that injuries were increased in severity by the lack of
seat belt use. But still you see idiots driving around without them on. ( I
wonder if these same idiots are on their way to the airport, where they will
board a plane and buckle up without a murmur?)

Waving 2 fingers is not considered polite in the UK.

This dates back to the 100 years war with france, if an english bowman 
was captured by the french, they cut of his two fingers so that he could 
not draw his bow.

In subsequent battles english archers would always raise 2 fingers to the 
opponent in a gesture of defiance.

My fog-lights don't flash when I pull back the TSL.  Does the fog-light switch
have to be in the OFF position (as suggested by another p-phile w/ '85 944) on
the 951?  I might have only tried this with the switch ON, I got in the habit 
of leaving the fog-light switch ON even when the headlights were off because 
they turn off automatically with the headlight switch.  I'll check tonight but
if not then I guess I have a wiring problem somewhere unless there's a 
separate flasher unit for the fogs??  The headlights flash fine.

Enquiring flashers want to know...I missed an opportunity to flash a new 968 
this morning (a rare sight in 'rural PA' where I live).

Subject: EuroProducts Strikes Again! (long)

The following are statements of fact.  Interpret it as you will.

On January 30, I ordered two pairs of manual factory C2 mirrors from
EuroProducts for $269 each, plus misc. for a total of $607.  They said
they were in inventory and would go out UPS Ground that day.  Florida
to DE is 2 days usually.

On February 7 I called back to see if my order had shipped.  Talking to
Mark, he said he had some problems getting the mirrors and would look
into it and call back.  When asked why he said he had them in hand, he
said he had done no such thing.

On February 8, I called back again, and was informed that the C2 manual
mirrors were no longer available and that he could get the electric
version for $369.  I said I would check around for manual and let him know if I wanted the electric, but until them to put the order on hold.  That was acceptable.

I then called The Racer's Group and talked to Kevin, who said he coul d
sell the C2 manuals for $269 and showed 6 pairs in inventory.  He said
it might take a few days to get the order out.  I also ordered an oil
cooler and some brake ducts for a total of $688.00

Still on February 8 I called EuroProducts and taked to Mark, cancelling the entirety of my order.  He said that was fine.

On February 17 I received my C2 mirrors from Racer's Group, along with other items.

Today I talked to Discover Card who said there was a charge January 30 to my card for 
$607 from EuroProducts.


I called Mark at EuroProdiucts to see if my account had been credited.  He said he was sure it had been and he would call me back.

About a year ago I ordered some Headers from EuroProducts.  I
specifically asked if the lower valve covers could be removed with the
headersd in place.  I ewas told they used these headers all the time
and that there was plenty of clearance.  I was quite adamant that they
must fit, and allow easy accress for valve adj. because I had had
problems with other headers.   No problem I was told.

When I received the headers, I gently bolted them up, being careful not
to scratch them, using my own new gaskets and nuts.  Sure enough it was
impossible to remove the valve covers with the headers installed.

I called europroducts to explain the problem to them.  Mark said "we
don't take returns on installed parts" and indicate that it was a
common problem, and I'd just have to remove the headers when I needed
to adjust the valves.  He refused to allow return and said they were
special orders even though he claimed to have them in stock when I
ordered them.

I called discover and explained the situation to them.  They suggested
I attempt to return them, and to include an explaination and shipping
receipt in a letter to them, and to CC: europroducts.  That way even if
the headers were refused I could prove returning them in good faith.

About 2 weeks later I got an apologetic call from Mark, who said he was
sorry for the misunderstanding, and saying he was very soryrry, bklah
blah blah, and how they would hate to lose a good customer, and wouls
I please accept 6 oil filters free as a token of apology.  I told him I
didn't particularly want any free oil filters and that I woud not be
conducting business with them in the future. He said he was sending
them anyway.  I told hom to suit himself.

Two days later I recieved the oil filters.

>>>>>>personal comment follows:

I should have known better.  I figured they had made an honest mistake
and perhaps they wern't such bad guys afterall.  Now I get to hash it
out again.  That'll teach me!

The Lucas mechanical system was used for many years on formula 1 cars - 
did 160k miles on 2 TR's with only one fuel injection failure, when the 
injector drive sheared. 

The fuel pump uses used to play up in summer, they got hot - you stopped 
 - the fuel vaporised in the pump, and you couldn't restart. We solved that 
prob by wrapping a length of fuel line round the pump motor, so fuel 
returning to the tank from the relief valve passed around the pump 
cooling it down.

The TR 2.5 ltr used to give 29 mpg (Imperial) = 36 us mpg driven with a 
lead foot it dropped to 22 mpg and pulled 27 mph per 1000 revs 

The tthing that I liked most was the overdrive, far better than 5 speed 
boxes, nice to have a gear change on a finger switch you could sit in 3rd 
o/d waiting for a gap in traffic then click and go

Perhaps the fact that a street legal Mitsubishi Eclipse finished 24th might
dampen the enthusiasm for this advertisement. My understanding is that
the Eclipse was not highly modified. Anyone know if this is true? If so, it
makes the stock 911's accomplishments somewhat less stellar.

Nevertheless, a highly modified 911 did finish first in GTS-2 (the same class
as the above two cars) and was fifth overall.

I wonder how much longer Porsche is going to use the current set of
TV ads? They seem to be trying to get the most from their advertising
dollar. I imagine they will not want to invest much more as long as the
new 911 continues to sell at a brisk pace.

I am very serious about purchasing this car.  Does anyone know of a 944 S2

Subject: Rebuilt 914 High Idle Question

I have a question concerning a 914 that's idling high ('74 2.0, stock)

All my hoses are new and correspond with Fred Pack's "914 Hose Layout" of
January '95. The engine has <2,000 miles on new rings, exhaust valve
guides, and lots of little parts, including injectors.  The ignition system
is in good shape and was timed to 27deg BTDC @ 3500 rpm. Vacuum advance and
retard both work properly. I used silicone only under the throttle body
(necessary) -- all other air intake gaskets were done "dry". It runs very
nicely, BUT

The idle is too high, and cannot be adjusted by the idle adjust screw (it's
already all the way in).  Once the engine is warm, it idles no lower than
1100 rpm. The aux air valve works properly, and is shut closed once the
motor's warmed up. Turning the CO mixture screw has little effect - it
drops a wee bit on both extremes of the range.

I disconnected each and every hose and tested it for vacuum or pressure.
The idle didn't change when any of them were plugged, except for the line
at the crankcase breather "valve" next to the oil filler cap.  This line,
when plugged, caused the idle to drop way down, to a point where it seems
"right", and could be adjusted by the idle air screw.  I can feel little
"putt-putts" coming out of the valve if I put my finger over it. 
Strangely, I feel very little air being sucked _into_ the crankcase
breather lines on the hose between the air cleaner and the junction/flame
trap.

Did I fail to seal the intake tracts properly when I re-assembled this
motor, or is there something else going on here?

Any help appreciated. I would like to fix this to avoid any CA smog hassles
come smog-check time.

	I stopped by VWs ETC recently, who's owner that bought my 
912E and proceeded to total it :^( .  He has a stripped out dirt brown '77 
911S (like T*d's...AAAAHHHH!!!) with straight front end that he plans to 
"clip in" eventually.  I  REALLY regret selling this vehicle, and I hope 
you folks can forgive me, my finances were hellish but the car deserved 
better...
	Anyway he has a bunch of basket case 914s lying around, the most 
interesting is one that I thought was a 914/6.  It has fender flares 
which are fiberglass and had an opposed six in it.  I asked about it and 
it turns out someone had slapped a CORVAIR engine in it!!!???  Is this 
conversion common and/or fast?  The car is rusted to death but you can 
tell someone once spent a lot of money on it, like leather upholstery, 
WIDE minilite style wheels, wild looking suspension, etc.  The shop owner 
doesn't know its history, he bought it with the shop some eight years 
ago.  He thinks it might be an original 914/6 because of its early build 
date (11/69) and its uplevel interior and tougher looking suspension.  
His question and mine...how do you tell a 914/4 from a 914/6?  Are the 
VIN #s different?  Suspensions?  Any info would be helpful.

Here's to Tom Cruise, awesome 928's, and beautiful women!

Subject: 914 mech - San Diego?

While I've been receiving this list for a few weeks and truly enjoy  
the info that comes across, this is my first posting. Please let me  
know if I don't get it quite right.

I have a '73 914 1.7 that was my daily car. It's needed some work  
over the last couple of years but I kept putting it off because of  
time and money (typical story). Lately it's been sleeping, waiting  
for me to give it life again. It looks like I'll be able to divert  
some funds in its direction in the next month or so, but still won't  
have much time to do any of the work myself.

So, with that said, I'm looking for recommendations for mechanics in  
San Diego (I live in the Del Mar area). After I moved down from the  
Bay Area, I was using Sorrento Valley Auto Service. The last couple  
of times I took my car there, I was less than pleased.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for your time.

I know you guys hate answering these questions but
on the off chance you already researched this I'll
ask anyway:

My 911 has the 6? & 7 inch 16" Fuchs.  Mostly for appearance
reasons I'm considering getting a couple of 8" wheels i.e. 
I'd have 7" on front, 8" onback, plus two cool hose reels <g>. 
[I'd probably be sticking with the 205/225 widths.]
Q: Is this enough to bump me out of SCCA Solo II stock class or 
    was this a somewhat obscure option for the '86 Carrera ?  
    
 thanx for you indulgence,

Subject: 944 Noisy Half-Shaft?


My 1983 944 has recently developed an unusual noise that I find quite 
disconcerting.  It is a pronounced "clicking" that varies with speed.  It is 
coming from the rear of the car.  This is *not* the same "whining" sound 
that I heard when my wheel bearings needed replacement.

At first, I thought that there was a nail in my right rear tire.  The noise 
sure sounded like that.  However, I pulled the wheels off the car and 
inspected them.  Nothing in the tires.

I then thought that maybe the brake shroud or something had been bent and 
was contacting the wheel as it rotated.  Both rear brake shrouds appeared to 
be clear of the wheels though.  For good measure, I bent them so that they 
were perfectly aligned.  No change in noise.  I inspected the wheels and 
wheel wells closely to see if *anything* could be hitting the rear hubs or 
wheels.  I could see nothing.

I am now mystified as to what is causing the noise.  It is intermittent, 
which has foiled my attempts to crawl around the back of the car to really 
localize it when I hear it.  Regrettably, I usually drive alone, which adds 
to the difficulty.  However, the noise is not so intermittent that I can't 
hear it at least once or twice a day.

One thing I have noticed is that the noise only seems to occur when I am 
accelerating.  The noise seems to be more pronounced when I accelerate 
around a curve, though it doesn't seem to matter which way the curve goes 
and I can still get the noise when travelling in a straight line.

The noise is not dependent on which gear I am in.  I have managed to produce 
it in both 2nd gear and 3rd gear.  (I have an automatic transmission -- no 
flames, please.)

The car seems to be functioning fine, but for this very worrisome and 
noticeable noise.  I have exhausted my store of ideas.  Does anyone have any 
idea what this could be?  I hate to bring it to my mechanic when I have no 
guarantee of even being able to reproduce the noise for him.  Thanks muchly 
in advance...

Hi, Hubert,

I would guess that one of your CV joints is starting to show it age of 12
years and has gotten a bit sloppy.  What you hear is one of the ball
bearings slopping around in there...

If you haven't done it recently, now would be a good time to disassemble
each of the CV joints, clean them and re-lube with a good molybdenum grease.

That's probably the problem...

Good luck,

You almost certainly have a bad CV joint. This is not a major problem and can
be fixed by the average home mechanic. Look for some deals on parts. It is
usually easier and sometimes cheaper to replace the whole axle with both
joints in place. A loud clicking under acceleration is a dead giveaway.
Sometimes they click because they have been run dry and they can be re packed
with grease although it has been my experience that once they are audible
they are shot.
Many times they are dry because the boot is cracked. It is not worth
replacing the boot is the joint has been run while dry. A new CV joint is
under $100 and that includes the boot.
I have an axle with a good joint in place if you need it. Price would be $50
without shipping

Hartje;

          Why in the world are you replacing all the ignition wires on you
944, this isn't a chevy or honda, as with all German cars there are 3 pieces
to each wire (2 ends and a solid core wire) which never go bad in all 4
cylinders.  If you have a problem in one cylinder just ohm the wire, find the
bad end or cable and replace just the defective one.  Experience has shown,
that short of abuse to the wires they last a very long time.

From: Ray@arkay.MV.COM
Subject: Turn signal prolem resolution

Hi,
Thanks to everyone who helped me solve the turn signal problem. 
It seems that quite a few Porschephiles are experiencing similar
symptoms, so here is a summary of what I learned.

If everything is working properly, only one of the turn signal
indicators on the dash board should blink, i.e. only the left
arrow for a left turn signal etc. When both arrows blink, this is
not a bug, but a safety feature which was specifically put in place
to alert the driver that the turn signals aren't drawing the 
expected amount of current. 

It seems that the turn signal housings and lenses aren't sealed all
that great, and the metal reflector / bulb sockets easily get
corroded. If there isn't a more obvious problem like a bulb being
totally out, you should take out all four bulbs (or 6 in the case of
euro cars) and clean the contacts. But more likely you will find that
the ground wire is to blame. On my car, it connects directly to the
metal of the reflector, without a good copper contact.

If you bought your car used, you may also find that the previous
owner did not replace bulbs with the required wattage. In my case
('82 930) I need 21W bulbs. Curiously, stores like Auto Palace with
a large selection of bulbs only list the application for a bulb 
(e.g. turn signal, parking light) and its socket code (something like
1073), but nowhere on the package or the bulb itself does it mention
how many watts it is supposed to have. So you have to look up the
codes, and in my case the code 1073 is indeed a 12V 21W bulb with 
regular big socket.

The turn signal flasher relay is usually not the culprit. In fact if
it is working as described it is working properly, and you should
really double-check the bulbs and the contacts (especially the ground
wire) before you order a new relay. 

I say usually, because in my case it actually was the problem. When
reading the maintenance records of my car, I found that the workshop 
had previously replaced the relay with a used one at no charge. So I
checked it out, and found that it was made by Hella, but wasn't the
right type that is supposed to be there. The "safety feature" I 
described above requires a 4-prong relay. The unit I found in my car
was missing the connector labelled "c", which is exactly the one that
makes the safety feature work. When I got the correct relay (at a 
cost of $36.95) my turn signal indicators finally started indicating!

Boy, that was a lot of work just to make sure that the correct
arrow lights up. But I guess having the "safety feature" now enabled
makes it worthwhile.

Subject: OEM Undercoating - early Pcars

Mark Hatch, et al:

I was told, some 20 years ago, that Porsche was using a 3M Product called
BODY SHUTZ.  I've used it myself a bunch of times on my old Pcars with lots
of success.  It stays resillient, but dries to a non-tacky state in about an
hour.  It is paintable when cured, though not necessary in most cases.

I've used it for my '73 T's fender wells and bellypan in an unpainted state -
it does not pick up and hold stones, and is easy to clean (if you're into
that!)

I've also used it on my concours '72 914.  The fender wells have been sprayed
over with factory color, with a perfect look.  I've alos redone my rocker
panels with it, and left them unpainted.  I was careful, and got a perfect
match to the original finish, and its very easy to maintain - you just wash
it.  Takes hits from stones with no chipping.

The product comes in either aerosol cans, or liquid.  If you plan to spray
the liquid on, you'll need a special air gun, available from 3M very
inexpensively (I got mine from them for $15 - 20 years ago).

I still am unsure as to whether this stuff was "really" the factory applied co
mpound, but do know that 3M products were in heavy use by Porsche during that
era.

I'm cetain that I have just opened a can of worms here, and that others will
remember differently.  Flame On!

============================================

Bob:

     You didn't say how much you wanted to lower it, and wether or not you
were going to lower the rear as well.  The front can easily be lowered by
turning the 10mm adjusting screws found at the rear of each front torsion bar
tube. I believe that 1 turn lowers the car between 1/4 - 1/2 of an inch.
 Make sure that you do each side the same amount.  If you run out of travel,
you will have to turn the entire adjuster.  Let me know.  That is the good
news.  The bad news is that it will change your toe setting and you will have
to get the car re-aligned.  Also, if you lower the front more than 1 inch,
you will need to get a bump steer spacer kit to raise the steering rack.
 This will negate the increased bump steer that will result form the
lowering.

     The rear is another story.  It involves removing and turning the rear
torsion bars with respect to the spring plates, and weight balancing and
completely re-aligning the car.  That is best left to a professional shop.

Subject: Porsche Undercoating

The question was raised as to matching Porsche OEM undercoating:

The match for that "pebble finish" super tough coating is Wurth SKS Stonegard
or "body schutz".  This is a water based elastomer compound that may be applie
d with either the Wurth Schutz Gun or "dappled" onto the surface with a
brush.  The easiest way to match the OEM finish is to use the gun, but with
patience and little artistic flair, you can achieve excellent results with a
small stiff brush and a larger soft brush.  The brush technique involves
"spattering" the honey like consistancy SKS with the stiff brush.  Dip the
brush into the liquid and fan the bristles with your finger to fling it onto
the surface.  Then using the end stiff bristles, dab it to the proper "bumpy
texture" using up and down strokes.  The up stroke will tend to create (pull)
bumps and the down will meld the bumps together.  When it has been dappled to
your satisfaction, dip the softer brush in water and smooth out any rough
areas and match the OEM texture.  This is somewhat of an artistic adventure,
so developing your technique on on your Yugo may be prudent.

Correct application involves thoroughly cleaning the area to covered with a
quality degreaser  or pre-paint cleaner to remove all loose rust,
undercoating, wax, dirt and grease.  The surface must be completely dry.  Appl
y the SKS and allow the dry.  It changes color as it dries and may be painted
in 4-5 hours (but 24 is better).  When dry, clean again with a pre-paint
cleaner, apply primer and then paint. It does not have to be painted if you
so choose.  Available colors are beige, black or gray.  The finished product
will be a super tough, flexible protective coating that helps prevent rust
and is very chip resistant.  The water base allows easy clean up, until it
dries.  Once is has dried, about the only way to remove it it to blast it
off. It seems to be impervious to almost anything.  So, clean off any "slops"
before they set. 

The directions warn against freezing.  Heed this warning.  Do not allow the
bottle to get below 32.  You will have a big rubber baseball floating inside
the bottle.  This is experience talking!  Anyone want two cases of baseballs
in bottles?

Hello George et al,

Thank you for your suggestions.  I aggree the factory manuals are

who sold it to me, nor myself  at the time I bought it (3.5yrs ago) realized
just how incomplete it was.  I do, however, have the complete table of

topics shown as containing troubleshooting in contents and, guess what, I
don't have them in mine.

I have not yet pulled the O2 from the firewall, but wanted to respond because
your comments as well as Kevin Gross's both included concern for "temperature
sensors".  The next sentence was lifted from his e-mail.
..............................................................................
.....................
If your engine runs fine when cold but has a problem warm, I'd
look for something temperature related. ......................................

I do not find anyplace in the manual regarding these temperature sensors,
only the temperature switch for the cooling system.  The same can be said for
the lowly Haynes manual.  If you've had personal experience with them, I'd
really like to know about their failure mode, testing, removal and
installation.  I also, pending the correct O2 test, would like to know whether
 to go ahead and replace it if pulling it out does nothing to engine
operation.

Thanks an awful lot for your help.

If the wear on the joints is not excessive you can extend the life of them by
swapping them over. But you have to be very careful to get the swap right. 

To do it, you move them over left side to right side and right side to left
side WITHOUT turning them end for end ie: The inbord end of the left shaft
becomes the outboard end of the right shaft.

By doing this, the loading on the bearing surfaces in the races is reversed,
(the ones that were torquing clockwise are now torquing anti-clockwise) and
the loading will be on an, as yet, unused area.

Hi, Will,

Pat Garvey says, "I'm finally at the point where I would really benefit me
with this Porsche thing to purchase a decent air compressor.  Given the
parameters below, what are the groups views/plugs/hates with specific brands
and models...."

Pat, before buying a compressor, you need to know *almost* specifically where
you will be using it and for what: in the garage, at the track, for impact
tools, spray guns, or just filling your tires?  The demands of each of these
vary (measured in cubic feet per minute, and pressure), and your satisfaction
will depend upon the proper choice.

Having said that, my choice is the Emglo model AM78-HC4V compressor.  It is a
compact, electric 1.5 hp unit with two tanks, delivering 4.1 cfm at 100 psi,
and regulated to operate at 80-125 psi.  It sells at discount for about $310,
complete with gages and regulator.  Emglo makes compressors in a variety of
styles and outputs, ranging from 0.75 hp ($300) to 5 hp ($770) to 8 hp
($1200) to 11 hp ($2000).

Budget some additional money for hoses (I have found two 50-ft lengths of
hose about right, but YMMV), fittings, and tools.

Emglo is a brand commonly used by contractors, and that's what first
attracted me to it.  It's very well-made, and most of the discount-house
brands pale in comparison.  Folks who use these things to make their living
also say to shy away from oil-less compressors.

Where to buy?  Look up one of the woodworking magazines (like Fine
Woodworking or Fine Homebuilding) and check out the ads.  Great discounts are
available on all brands, and shipping is usually free.  Yes, FREE.

Good luck.

Dear Rich,

You can certainly install 1.8 fuel injection on a 2.0 engine, just use the
2.0 intake runners. Since the 912E was manufactured with a 914 2.0 engine
with AFC 1.8 fuel injection, we know the factory approved the application. A
trick we have done in the past is to use the 1.8 system but install the 912E
control unit, airflow meter and injectors.

The AFC system is basically what all modern Porsches use and is superior to
the old D-Jetronic/MPC system. Although we always advocate keeping the 914 as
stock as possible, if you do not have a 2.0 injection system to install, the
1.8 system is the next best thing and far better than carburation.

Dear Pete,

Your 1975 914 does not use the hole in the steering wheel. '70-'71 model 914s
used the hole for a horn contact stalk, but this was superceded in 1972 to a
wire which clipped to the back of the horn butterfly via a contact plate.
This plate had a built-in male clip which easily broke. We repair this piece
with a special rivit and clip as the part is not available without the
purchase of the complete hub/butterfly assembly.

So, to repair your assembly, extend the wire by passing the hole and install
a female clip. Clip this to the butterfly contact plate, make sure the horn
boot is firmly planted in the middle of the plate and gently clip the
butterfly to the steering wheel turning it clockwise. (We always install it
with the ignition switch turned to "on" in case we accidently pinch and
ground the horn contact wire.

914 speedometer cables fail most often from engine heat melting the
protective cover. The other possibility is the speedometer head locking and
shapping the cable at the head. Other than those failures the cables last a
long time.

Common speedometer related failures are as folows:
     1. Rear angle drive
     2. Rear housing expansion bolt loosening and stacked drive gear failure
     3. Cable breaking or melting (a melted cble can make the speedometer
needle bounce.)
     4. Cable not routed smoothly (the speedometer needle will bounce or the
cable will snap prematurely)
     5. Speedometer head failure (usually the odometer stops turning first)

Although the *optional* 6&7 x16" alloys are the more popular wheel for the
Carreras (seems like they almost all came with them), the 15x7 & 8 were a
standard size and you would have no problems in SCCA stock class running
them.  This is, of course, as long as we're talking either factory wheels or
aftermarket wheels within .25" of factory offset *AND* as long as it's the
15" wheels and not 16 x 7&8s]]  Any width tire may be used in SCCA stock.
 You will also benefit from a reduction in overall diameter with the 15"
combo (versus your 16s) so the car will feel a little quicker and more
responsive -- 'course your speedo will read high....

I would suggest 225/50/15 on front and rear (versus the 205 you were
planning to use on front).  Oh, and of course if you are planning on running
a soft compound tire, run the BFG R1 -- set your pressures for AX around 26
psi rear and 20 psi front (hot), go at least 5 psi higher for the street.

I'd keep the 16s and run street tires on them -- you can swap them out
before and after events....

Gentlemen:

Somewhere along the path from $15 to help out Stan to $100 for patron-class

It seems like the type A personality types have taken over ('I can pledge more

the ante gets up to the $50 to $100 area I would like to have more specific

Hi, 

I had this same problem. If you decide to relube those CV joints (which 
isn't a hard job), you might want to consider switching the right half 
shaft assembly with the left on and vice versa. I did this on my 85 944 
and the clicking went away. Do this only if the CV's are symmetrical. 
I found out that one of my sleeves that held the bearings were worn. By 
switching the whole shaft, the bearing no longer puts force on the worn 
part of the sleeve when I accelerate (unless I go in reverse). It's like 
I have a brand new CV joint:)  Hope this helps.

Why not just take good care of your battery trays (and batteries) and

A 30 minute treatment every 6 months will keep them in good shape for a

has baked the insulation around the wires.  Now they put on a very

Subject: Porsches on TV

        I wound up watching lots of TV over the weekend, since I've been
kinda sick (cough, sniffle)...  I found a couple of Porsches on several
shows:
Friday, on the Rockford Files (that's the James Garner show) they had a
black 911 as the car of one of the bad guys.  Early or mid-70s.  Inter-
estingly enough, they actually used 911 engine sounds for it!  Hollywood
usually wants to use American V8 noises for all cars, even VW bugs...
In the same episode, an orange 914 was parked right in front of the front
door of a bank that Rockford was going into--and there was even a green
914 at an intersection in a later shot.
_Beastmaster 2_, starring Wings Hauser, concludes with a tribe of primi-
tives worshipping a red 944 cabriolet.  They could do worse.  8)
And finally, in the airport thriller on last night, the plane lands on a
runway being used for autocrossing--and one of the autoX cars is a nice
bright yellow 356 cabriolet.

Subject: P-car commercials

Hey all,

The thread about Porsche commercials brought to mind my 
favorite commercial featuring our beloved marque. Back 
in the late 80's, the Isuzu ads featuring David Leisure
as "Joe Isuzu" were an absolute hoot. The best of the genre
showed "joe Isuzu" in a little econobox pulling up alongside
a 930 with two stereotypical Germans in it. The passenger
looks to the driver and demands "Lose heem". The 930
accelerates, but "Joe Isuzu" stays up, then "joe"
makes some witty comment and leaves the 930 behind.
The final shot shows the passenger of the 930 telling
the driver "I hate Joe Isuzu". It should have gotten a 
Clio.

BTW, if anyone knows how I can get a copy of this ad,
please let me Know how.

Subject: 1971 911T Questions

Hi Gang:

I'm new in the group... I've read my rules and I'll try to do everything
correct.

I have a couple questions regarding my new purchase, a 1971 911T.

The car was well maintained. I purchased it with records dating back to 1978.  I
found the original tool kit in the front trunk.  About all that was left in it
was the original fan belt and the tool for securing the pulley whilst changing
it.  Does anybody know what came standard in that kit?  Or... is there a book
regarding restoration type issue that would answer this question?

I am having the car repainted and I would like to put the S front spoiler on at
this time.  Were these an option on this year?  I have read that they were.

Based on the previous S spoiler question you may have gathered that I like a
little more aggressive look.  The car came with the Fuchs alloys (14's).  I'll
be needing new tires for the summer.  How far can we go? I was looking at
190/60/14's.  Any tire experts out there?

And finally, this may seem really stupid, but... what is the "Appearance Group"?
I've seen mention of it while looking for Deco trim parts but I've never really
had an explanation.  From what I gather it's slightly wider trim (which I have)
and rubber trim caps on the chrome bumper extensions (which I also have).  Is
this right?  Is there more?

All your help will be greatly appreciated.

would prefer submitting someone else's well written article to my own poorly

Hello All,

I have started to summarize the returned survey forms. Great responses!!

 FYI, here is the count by Model:

924 = 7
924 Turbo (931) = 4
924 S = 3

944 = 35
944 2.7 = 2
944 S = 5
944 Turbo (951) = 15
944 Turbo S (951 S) = 3
944 S2 = 6

968 = 2

Note: The completed survey will be completed in a couple of weeks.
I will post the results to the list, for those interested.
It will then become a part of the 924/944/968 FAQ. 

 Since I am still getting responses, I am going to post the survey form one
last (yeah right that's what you said last time!)
THANKS AGAIN FOR ALL WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED! IT HAS BEEN A REAL SUCCESS!
Come on, lets try for that goal of 100 responses!

Hello All,

I am trying to prepare a owners report survey for the new 924/944/968 FAQ.
The purpose of the survey is to collect maintenance and repair records for the
924/944/968 series. I am including a form to make data input easier for you.

I am not sure what the final format will be, but I will get a better idea when
I recieve your input. A comments section will appear at the end of the form 
for any additional information you can provide. When completed, it make for 
some interested reading, for those who may have a common problem, or would 
just like to hear other owners comments and problems, without having to search
all the past archives.

  The more info I recieve the more accurate the survey. The owners records
are important, this is the main purpose of the survey. Please try to
help if you can. This would be a great addition to the FAQ!

Once I have the compilied the past section of the owners survey, I will
update the the owners report from time to time. This will then be posted
to the FAQ .(also to the list so all can see the results)

The completed form can be sent to me directly for review. DO NOT SEND TO
ENTIRE LIST!!

Mike Kehr  INTERNET:71324.3010@compuserve.com

I was thinking that a mileage format would be a good idea ( repairs and 
maintance list by mileage, and a topic, format ie. Waterpumps, motor mounts, 
clutches etc. Any comments, let me know.

Is the internal relief valve setting the same?  What are the differences in
flow characteristics? 
Are there any hidden negatives?

I am thinking of substituting the 928 filter on my track 86 944 Turbo.  

Reason 1:  The longer can will make installation/removal easier.  

Reason 2:  The increased filtration (this is an assumption)  is not a bad
thing, especially for an engine run at red line a significant percentage of
it's life.

I appreciate any assistance and/or other options in this area.

Hi John, and New members of the Group (who are wondering what all this talk of
money for a free list is all about...)

Your points are good, and are taken in the constructive manner offered.

In the meantime, re Type-A personalities.  Hey!  watch yo' mouth!  I
resemble that remark!  (whack)  (thank you, I needed that.)  What I meant
to say; and what I have said all along; and what *Stan* has said, is:

*Nobody* has to contribute anything.  We are trying to acquire the funds
to build the infastructure to ensure the survival of Porschephiles
independent of any member.  It's not a type-a personality thing at all.
Folks who have pledged $100 are those who have recognized the high
capital cost of accomplishing this, and who have the means to contribute
more.

I don't have firm figures for the costs, and that doesn't bother me a
bit. I do know that Stan has made the service available to the group,
using the capital resources that he depends upon to earn his daily bread,
and is begining to feel the strain.

Why?  Well, Porschephiles has steadily grown to a membership of *OVER*
1200 members, generating traffic of more than 68,000 messages per month.
This volume of traffic is eating a significant chunk of Stan's T-1
service.  Not to put too fine a point of this, this eats into Stan's
livelihood, and, amigos, that ain't right.  We owe Stan an inestimable
debt of gratitude.  The very least we can do to show it is to take as
much of the capital burden upon ourselves as possible.

So where do the suggested contribution numbers come from?  Can you say "Rectal 
Data?"  It is my sense that a Student should be able to afford $15.  If a 
poor starving Stoont can cough up $15, it isn't far out of line for a Working 
person, who can afford both a love of Porsches and access to the 'net, to be 
able to pony up $50.  If you want to do more, then $100 seemed like a nice, 
tidy round number.

I don't think it's anal-retentive to recognize those who dig deeper.  I
have assured all that no one's name or contribution level will be
published *unless* they instruct me to do so.  NOBODY *HAS* TO CONTRIBUTE
ANYTHING!

I also know (I've been investigating the costs of becoming a Service
provider on the 'net, and) it's not cheap.  Last week's InfoWorld has a
comparison of two ppackage servers, one from BBN, and the other a Sun
Netra.  We're looking at $7-10K just for the box and software.  I don't
believe that Mailing list Software was in those figures, but I do know
that they do *not* include T-1 service.  As we determine what the blivid
(5 lbs in a 3 lb bag) of stuff totals out to be, you will be advised.

But this is *not* some anal-retentive thing working here (well, that's my
story and I'm stickin' with it...), but an attempt to offer *guidance*
that has been requested.  Frequently.

So what If you don't send anything?  You're *still* a Porschephile, with
all the privilidges and rights pertaining thereto.  As long as the
service survives...

If you want to ensure the survival of this organization, and I sure as
hell do, then send what you can.  Many folks have asked what would be
appropriate to send, and I've tried to offer guidelines.

So What do you get out of this?  How about a nice shiny *Number*,
reflecting the order in which I receive your check?  How about
*Satisfaction* that you've been part of one of the *great* happenings on
the 'net?

Finally, the "membership" issue.  Within 30 days from last Friday, we must
apply to the IRS for Non-Profit Organization status.  (tick...tick...tick)
I'm the guy in the barrel here.  We need to decide what kind of an orgainztion
we will be.  Here, again, you can be a PORSCHEPHILE and not join any more
organizations.  Many of us would like to be the Electronic Frontier Region
of PCA, but this is not universal.  Most of the Non-US folks are not interested
in affiliating with PCA, and that's no problem either.

Everyone *Can* send a donation; *NOBODY* has to!  Everybody can Join (whatever
orgainzation we decide); aganin, *NOBODY* has to...there is enough interest in
the EFR business that we *can* go that route if required to keep my butt out
of the [deleted] grasp of the IRS.

Dear Andrew,

The oil filler installed PCV should not pass crank case breath unless pushed

In early Porsches, Carrera denoted the top of the line model.
There was a 356 Carrera and from 73 to 76 or 77 there was a
911 Carrera as top of the line. In 78, all 911s were called SC,
for Super Carrera, and featured full galvanization of the body
and a 3.0 litre motor. In 84 the 911 was relabelled the Carrera

I disagree vehemently.  As a firefighter, I know at least two people
who owe their lives to airbags: one, driving a Volvo, left the roadway
and Teed a Jersey barrier at 65mph.  Walked away.  The other was in a
Honda Del Sol and was hit head-on by a Detroit Iron driver (who was
rear-ended himself).  Result: Unbelted driver of Detroit Iron killed,
belted passenger seriously injured.  Del Sol driver, belted behind
airbag, cut by glass on hands and walked away.

This is anecdotal, obviously.  But airbags have a place, and crash
statistics will bear out their save rates.  I've personally seen many
people injured severely, even while properly secured behind belts.
High speed collisions involve HUGE amounts of energy compared to our
little bodies' strength.  I saw a driver literally cut in half by his
shoulder belt, and others with nasty head and neck injuries, all
preventable in an airbag car.

*I* find it obnoxious that many new cars still don't have the bags
available (even optionally) on both front seats.  And I DESPISE those
automatic track belts that cause people to forget the lap belt (and
insult those of us who always belt up anyway).

Why have brakes at all?  If we all drove as well as you claim to, we'd
have time to downshift to avoid a collision every time!  Alas, I do
not live in the land of universally predictable drivers, slow animals,
and hazard-free roads.

It's a pretty simple engineering exercise to see that technological
advances like ABS and airbags save lives, and that the lives lost to
device failure is minicscule in comparison.  I'd be happy to have 'em.

Your symptoms are almost identical to the ones I observed on my car.
I became convinced that something was loose somewhere because
I would jiggle the circuit connector that plugs into the foil on the bottom
of the instrument cluster while driving and often could revive the speedo 
for a short time. However, I was not able to find the real problem until
I dismantled the entire instrument cluster and began following the circuit
with an ohm meter.  Finding the loose rivet was simply a matter of luck!!!
(I happened to be looking at the meter just when I pressed on the rivet!)

First, an additional test you should perform:  Does your auto speed control
function properly, even when the speedo is dead?  Looking at the circuit
diagrams in the Porsche manual will show that the cruise control input 
comes from the speedo circuit (i.e., from the magnetic sensor on the tranny).
 
If the cruise control works and the speedo doesn't, you've isolated the 
problem to the speedo.  If the cruise control also doesn't work, your
problem may be in the sensor, the sensor wire, or the circuit connection
on the bottom of the instrument cluster. (I can't be positive if the wire 
from the sensor branches to the cruise control at the plug on the 
edge of the foil (I think it does) or if it branches closer to the speedo
connector).

There are two connectors on the bottom of the instrument cluster, one
to the left of the steering column and one to the right.  I don't remember
without looking at my manuals which connector has the speed sensor
wire and which pin it is, but I vaguely remember fumbling around with
the left one while driving on Pacific Coast Highway between Santa
Barbara and LA one day (while simultaneously cussing out the "genius"
who designed their electrical connectors -- you would think Porsche 
could do a better design than Nissan! *sigh*).  

If you do need to take the instrument cluster out, it is a very easy process
but you do need the Porsche manuals.  In order to test, you'll want the
circuit diagrams and then, to take the cluster out, you'll need to know
where the 4 bolts are and how to take the switches apart (must do before
removing the cluster).  Do you have the manuals?

A hint:  you have to remove the steering wheel; nowhere in the manual
do they tell you how to get the horn pad off.  If your steering wheel is
like mine, the horn pad (with the 928 stamped on it) PULLS off -- under-
neath are two springs which fit into two detents punched into the 
steering wheel frame.  Simple brute force is needed to pull the edges
of the springs out of the detent in which they are wedged.  The reverse
is also true -- when putting it back together, a solid hit with the side or
flat of your hand is required to seat it properly (otherwise the horn 
won't toot!).

A warning -- disconnect the battery before doing this project.  First, 
if you don't, your horn will go off the minute you start trying to take
the wheel off.  Second, you could fry something if you leave the 
battery connected and accidently touch live wires.  (not to mention
starting the car if you are really unlucky!).

Let me know how you're doing ...  I doubt if you're in the LA area,
but if you are, I'd be willing to help if you get stuck.

Good luck!

Hi All,
     
We have madfe the big time! Forbes magazine publishes a suppliment 
called ASAP for
MIS managers and the like. They had an article about on-line bulletin boards and
forums, Porschephiles was prominently mentioned.
     
This is quite a step. Many businesses struggle to get mentioned in 
Forbes or the two
suppliments they publish with the magazine.
     
We have arrived, now the party may begin!

If I'm not mistaken the average message is well under 512 characters (bytes).
Correct me if I'm wrong but....

68000*512 is about 35million times 10bits/byte (overheads a bitch) is
about 350million bits/month.
Now I'm told T1 is a bit over 1million bits/second.
That's a whopping 6 minutes/month.

Subject: 924/944 Factory Ignition Harnesses


In answer to a couple of posts, the following is characteristic of 924/944
factory ignition harnesses:

After about 5 years, the outer insulation material starts break down in the
wires. This will eventually lead to arcing and other detrimental ignition
behavior.

When this occurs, you have a few choices. You may buy new. You may replace
the one that is bad with a mickey-mouse solution (I have seen many). You may
repair the bad wire correctly.

To do the last, I usually do one wire at a time. I have found that most 
solid wire (actually stranded but copper wire rather than carbon core) will 
work. To repair, I UNSCREW the wire from each end. A factory wire has a
cup receptacle on each wire end that has a threaded end. I remove the old 
wire from the end by carefully cutting the copper wire out. I remove all 
material from the cup, then carefully drill a small hole into the base.
The hole drilling is a little tricky, but patience will reward you with
a small, clean hole. I then cut new wire to the same length as the old, 
stripping 1/4" of insulation from the wire. I insert the wire, then solder
the wire to the cup. If you use some discretion when soldering, you should 
have a clean joint with minimal solder. When both ends are done, put some 
dialectric lubricant on the wire and cup, then rethread and carefully 
tighten each end. Re-install the wire, go to the next. Just to be on the 
safe side, I scrounge extra wires for the ends, just in case I break one.

Total cost = $12 for Accel black copper core wire.

One other tip: pull the plastic cover off the coil. Remove the coil lead and inspect the coil connector for green corrosion. Clean the connector with 
electrical contact cleaner, scrubbing with a q-tip until the green grunge
is gone. Check all connections on the distributor cap for the same, then the 
spark plug ends. Resistance is about 5K ohms for the entire lead and end.

Hey Bob!!

Well,I'm not sure if it spontaneously broke in two; the fact is I had been 
working on that part of the engine the last month.  I took apart the front
part of the engine to get to all the seals in the engine that were leaking oil
and replaced alot of gaskets too!  I torqued everything correctly and
reinstalled all the loose pieces and fired it up.  I let it get warm and than
set the timing.  I stopped it and checked for leaks; NONE!!!  I was so happy!
This was on Saturday Afternoon.  I then drove it to my girlfriends house and
tinkered a little more and of course,l GLOATED that it no longer leaked oil!
I then drove it home and raced it around town.  Checked all the belts; A-ok.
I deemed it ready for its maiden voyage (this month) to Santa Monica and left 
early this morning at 1:30 AM.  I stopped and got food for me in Carlsbad but
did not turn off the car.  I poped the hood and heard a little slapping of
the timing belt.  I thought to myself, "The belt is finally starting to loosen
up.  I'll tighten it in Santa Monica."  With those words I was Doomed.  I drove
all the way to Long Beach when I felt a slight surging and I was loosing power,
and then, Silence.  I'm still coasting, so I de-clutch and change down, but
the engine isn't picking up.  I try the starter.  It turned, but didn't
catch either.  I coast to a stop at the Atlantic Ave Exit in Long Beach right
next to a call box, and even next to a guard rail and cement island
under a bridge (in case it rains).  I get out and pop the hood, thinking that
it is a loose belt that jumped it tracks, and , wrongly, thinking it'll take a 
couple o'minutes to fix.  Lo and behold, the belt is not loose, but correctly 
tensioned but the cam sprocket (left side) doesn't look right.  I take the bolt
out of the sproket and watch in awe as the sprocket falls into my hands.  I'm
still optimistic, for about .000001 x 10to the 9 second, thinking that it just
slipped it's Woodruff key.  And then I notice the little brass distributor
drive gear.  And I start laughing!  It's 3:30 AM on a tuesday morning, I'm in
Long Beach on I405 30 minutes from my apartment in Santa Monica or 1 1/2 hours
from my aprtment in San Diego and my "just fixed" car just took the dump of its
life and I'm laughing!  I pack up my tools and head to the call box to wake up
my Alfa friend Craig.  He comes over and we use his AAA card to call a tow
truck.  I tell the tow truck driver, "Take me to Santa Monica, please".  We 
load up, thank Craig and head North with me talking about racing and buring
928's to the ground and the tow truck driver picking my brain re: L-jetronic
FI on his 280Z.  What a night!  I don't know what happened.  The bolt didn't
loosen (until I took it off; it, of course, was already beginning to loosen
as the camshaft had sheared and was wearing against itself) and the belt wasn't
tight; certainly not tight enough to break a camshaft! (" Gee Rocky, Don't
know my own strength!")  and the engine wasn't revving over 2600 (75-ish mph)
all night.  It broke right at the last bearing support on the outside of the
head.  So, WHEN did it break?

Anyway, I need another camshaft that only has two ends and not 4.

later,
bill

Subject: Porsche Burgers



Here's something of international interest.

Last night my wife and I had a hamburger at a Burger King located at the
Casa Grande off-ramp off Interstate 10 between Phoenix and Tucson. Inside
were large reproductions of about 10 factory Porsche posters, all with
glass, matted and framed, and signed and numbered 114 of 500 by "Steinger"
plus the 917 Poster by Dave Marek (former member of Sacramento Valley
Region, PCA and now big-time Principal Designer for Honda R&D in
Torrance).

Except for the Marek poster, all had the official Porsche name in extended
lettering at the bottom and said, "Printed in Germany." Several were 911 and
917 posters and one showed Dan Gurney in the flat-eight F-1 car.

When the lady behind the counter asked for my order I said, "all the
posters," but she said they weren't for sale. All were very securely
attached  to the wall.

Stop in for a burger if you're in the neighborhood.

Folks,

I have a small favor to ask. Does anyone have some factory information on the
details of an 82 3.0 SC engine? What I was hoping for was either a photo copy
from a microfiche that shows all the parts and details for the engine or a
copy of the engine section of one of the factory manuals. I have the manuals
for the 65-71 ( I have a '67 912 that I am putting a 82 3.0 in. Also, if
anyone else is trying to make this conversion  I have accumulated some GREAT
info on how to make this conversion 'easy') but wanted to take a look at the
engine section from the  72-83 manual. I hate to spend another $200 bucks for
a few pages. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Also I am looking for a set of Weber 40-IDA-3Cs that will fit the above
motor. I have the complete CIS system, but hate all the spider looking
plumming and would love to convert it to Webers. If anyone is interested in
the CIS individually let me know. It is for sale.

Thanks,

I didn't watch the airport thriller, since I already know how it turned
out. This incident really happened, I don't know if they made that clear or
not. That includes the slalom on the abandoned (sort of) airfield. I was
working at Porsche when somebody brought in the Stuttgarter Zeitung or
whatever with a picture of this emergency-landed plane, with a 911 autocrossing
in front of it. If I remember right, the plane was Canadian (one of my
Canadian friends at Porsche would say "that explains it") and they put X
liters of fuel in instead of X gallons, or pounds, or some conversion-factor
problem like that.

This always happens to me when I put on Cool Carbons for the track. Do you

want to replace them, you might want to try a set of anti-squeal backing

to the strong points of the chassis as is with the RaceTec design.

The shops I've been talking to are pushing the RaceTec pretty hard, and I'm
trying to determine if the floor mounting points used in the AutoPower setup
are indeed not strong enough to withstand an impact.  So which would be
safer during a rollover - an AutoPower full rollcage, or a RaceTec rollbar?

My '71T didn't come with a tool kit. The previous owner has it in her
garage somewhere but she has been unable to find it!  There is a wonderful
reference book available for the early 91 that will answer all of your
questions and more. It's By Dr. Brett Johnson and it's called, "The 911 &
912 Porsche.  A Restorer's Guide To Authenticity."  I highly recommend this
book, it's cheap (relatively) and filled with pictures and facts regarding
the pre '74 911 and 912.

The spoiler was standard on the '72S and optional on the other '72 models.
To the best of my knowlege, they were not available for a '71 911.  I do
like the look of the spoiler though.

I just went through this tire wheel thing with my '71T.  I've always
thought that the 14's looked small.  Anyway, 190's should fit fine though
the 60 series may make the tire well look somewhat anemic in addition to
giving you a fairly large speedometer error.  If you like an aggressive
look, my recommendation would be to go with 205/60x15 or 205/65x15 on 6x15
Fuchs on the rear and either the same or a 195/60 or 65x15 on the front.
I've tried 6x16 and 7x16 on the back of mine and they just don't "look"
right to me though 205x16's will work.

The standard (optional) Fuchs on a '71T were 6x15 with 185/70VR15's all
around.  Good luck finding those!

This is correct, I also believe that the apperance group included the "S"

There's a little pamphlet written by Ray Scruggs on alignment

of Pano, and sells for somewhere around $10.  Buy it.  It's
really quite good.  Armed with it you can do an entire alignment,
including lowering, camber, toe, and so on, in your home.  It'll
take you longer than a pro shop, but at least when you're done
you'll lnow more about your car, and you'll know it's been done
right.  Have you ever wondered if the alignment gear at your local
shop is calibrated?  by whom? when?

If you're serious about lowering and proper alignment, it'll be
the best $10 you spent.

Hey 'Philes,

Now, I'll bet alot of you have seen this comercial but it was a first 
for me this evening.  There's a new AMEX ad running that shows a rather 
beleagered Jerry Seinfeld dashing his way back to the cruise ship he 
fell off of using his AMEX card to wax his way along.  At one point, 
thought, the "card" didn't serve him as well as the silver 959 he was 
driving to the dock to catch a boat (unless he put the 959 on the card 
;-) *NOT*).  It was definately a *SWEET* car, several good views of it.

Now the question is, IS IT HIS?  I know he's a Porschephile in the 
keenest sence of the word but a *9*5*9*!  Anyway, I'm sure if Jerry had 
any creative control over the commercial, he probably arranged for the 
car to be there.

Have a good one,

Subject: Re: Turbo water injection


Hi all,
Someone recently asked about pros /cons of injection systems for
turbos. While I don't have any firsthand knowledge, I have been
following a discussion about this in the internet newsgroup
rec.autos.sport.tech. Basically, it was mentioned that water 
injection reduces probability of destructive detonation, helps
absorbe excess heat, and in the process the generated steam adds
torque due to the additional pressure exerted onto the piston by
the expanding steam.

Of the disadvantages that were noted, the danger of internal engine
corrosion was the one that alarmed me most. In fact the idea of an
engine rusting inside out bothered me so much that I forgot any
other problems they mentioned.

Re-reading Bruce Anderson's book ("Porsche 911 Performance Handbook")
I noticed that he mentioned another way to increase safe boost limits
is the use of an additional fuel injection system to enrich the
mixture at high boost levels. Unfortunately, the company mentioned
in the book no longer makes any such devices, but EBS Engine Builders
Supply mentioned on the phone that they have something like that. I
asked them for specifics but probably didn't sound ready to plunk
down tremendous amounts of cash so they haven't sent me anything yet.

While I realize that I have a lot to learn before I attempt such
performance improvements, I am very curious about anything that 
makes higher turbo boost safe or at least less dangerous. Larger
intercoolers are also of interest.

My 930 has adjustable turbo boost, all the way up to 1.5 bar, but   
Bruce's picture of the melted piston is very vividly in my mind
anytime I am tempted to reach behind the driver's seat to touch the
forbidden tap of instant pleasure. 

Another thing that is very much on my mind is the previous owner's
repair bill totalling $7000 in parts, labor, and machine shop costs
for rebuilding the engine after a "mysterious loss of power".

I should have been clearer: that's the total volume of mail that *EACH

volume is

	(n+4)*V + (C*n * X) where

	n is the number of subscribers (the plus four accounts for the

	  to the digest, and the one that goes to the test account that
	  keeps  me posted as to whether or not this stuff is "getting out")
	V is the volume from the previous note
	C is some multiplier for how many addresses generate some
	  sort of "error message", currently about 0.23
	X is the average size of the error message generated, 
	  currently about 30k (lots of stupid mailers return 
	  digests)

Not counted: retransmissions due to network or system failures, mis-queueing
or other problems.

Implications: this little system is *SMOKING*... On average, there are 
3 MBytes *A DAY* of admin mail that has to be processed. Fortunately, 
I have that pretty well automated, but it still takes time. So, add it
all up, and see what you get. Imagine trying to run that on a 28.8 dialup

>                       had glass.

>                       talking about 911s here).

>There are several trim and tune options:
>
>       T, E, S         The early years (the latest any of these

>       SC              This was the standard car (there was also the

>    - 1968-1973 early power.  These 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4 liter 911s
>      (my personal favorite) saw either mechanical fuel injection
>      or carburators.
>
>    - 1974-1977 middle-year 911s.  These cars had the 2.7 liter
>      engines that had a notoriously short life span.  This is
>      the beginning of the crash bumpers (with the accordian
>      sections at the edges) and K-Jetronic fuel injection.
>
>    - 1978-1983 911SC.  These 3.0 liter SCs are powerful,
>      luxurious, and nearly bullet-proof.
>
>    - 1984-1989 Motronic Carreras.  Like the 911SC, but with a
>      3.2 liter engine and Motronic fuel injection.
>
>    - 1989-1993 964 (original 911 Carrera 2/4).  These cars have
>      the one-piece, all body color bumpers and the engine cover

>       - a vertical structural strip running under the rear engine
>         grille,
>       - sunroof models during these years had a drain slot above the

Date: 21 Feb 95 12:59:48 -0800
From: Daryl Savage (Exchange) <daryls@microsoft.com>
Subject: New Rotors on a '78 930

My normal track car is a '78 930 with S4 calipers up front and
the 930 fronts on the rear axles...

well, its time for new rotors (they'r stock) and i am wondering 
how hard this is going to be.

also, the rotors on '78 to '80 930's are different (and more $$) then
the later models.  I've heard they are *better* but am curious
as to why (floating?  huh?).

i run Pagid's on the track and being as they are scarce
(esp in this odd arrangement) i'm wondering if i am gonna
have to toss my last pair (which have one sesson's wear)
due to mating issues, etc...  same question for my street 
pads too...

the car is not lightened, pretty highly modified (ie: higher then
normal top speeds) and is not babied on the track.   the pucker
factor coming into the first turn off the straight is pretty tight at 
165 to 185 mph so i'd like (ahem) to do the right thing wrt the
brakes...

thoughts?  ideas?  experiences?

thx

American Express has a new commercial with Seinfeld.
He drives a silver 959 briefly, I think. You really don't get to
see the car that much. The camera is too focused on his grining 
face. But it is nice to see a 959 once in a while.

Subject: WANTED: 912, 914, 924

I'm bored and want something Porsche-style to fix up. What I'm looking 
for is as follows: Any 912, 914, or 924. Wrecked, damged, or whatever 
(but still having a good body otherwise). Minor rust is acceptable, but 
as always, not preferred. I would like it running, but top condition is 
not expected (ie. if it sounds bad and all, but at least has some life in 
it to rebuild... it's good)

What I wanna do to it: Have it painted, replace all the interior things, 
all the little exterior things (lenses, bulbs, etc.) new muffler system, 
etc. It should be in all aspects: a project car.

Oh, as for the color, it doesn't matter too much, but I'd like to keep it 
original, and would rather not have silver.

As far as price goes, I'd like to keep it under $1000, so somewhere in 
the range of $400-$1000 is good for me. I fully intend to spend $1500+ on 
getting it up and running, then maybe $1000 more after that. (In what 
I've seen, this sounds reasonably realistic)

Summarized:
912, 914, 924
Running preferred, but not necessary.
Minor rust acceptable (ie. can't put your fist through the closed door)
Fav'rite colors (well, hell, I don't expect to get 'em, but can't hurt):
Blues, Reds, Greens, Yellows
under $1000

If you have something like this sitting in your yard, just quietly 
awaiting death, or have one that you lost interest in... e-mail me at:

Thank you muchly!

You know, that just *BAFFLES* me.... Even back in The Old Days, you
had to have this majik $30k/year "grant" from someone on the DARPA
approved list, payable to the Defence Communications Agency -- and
that was for a crummy 9.6k leased line!

The Internet has  *NEVER* been free -- it's just that there are a lot
of people who have put significant pieces of their own budgets into making 
it look that way.  Ditto for Usenet -- I used to spend about $2k/month 
from my research budget on dial and leased line services passing bits 
from seismo (east coast) to lbl-csam (west coast) -- and as a by-product, 
bringing good connectivity to Texas -- as part of the backbone 
when things like that still mattered. That was $24k/year I could have
done something else with, like hire another half of a tech or support
part of another research project. Nope, I did it because it was the
"right thing to do".

The big change going on now is that for the first time, end users are
starting to see those costs. The total numbers are HUGE - my sources say
that all of the internet service providers will spend something like
$120 million this year on buying services (leased line, dial-up, access
to the backbone, etc) that will let them be in business. That doesn't
even include the hardware and staff costs (for which I've seen no estimates)!!

Subject: Roll Cages

Greetings:

While I have had no personal experience with the Race-Tech roll cage, I have
installed a number of Safety Devices Cages in Porsches and a few Autopower
cages in other SCCA showroom stock cars.  From the sounds of it, the Race
Tech cage is similiar to the S, D., for which you weld in nut plates to
structural portions of the chassis (I.E. door sills etc).
The Autopower cages I have dealt with mount directly to the floor with
reinforcing plates bolted under the floor forming a sandwich of the floor
pan.  IMHO the first method is far superior, using the structure of the
chassis to absorb the impact of a rollover rather than just the pan.  It also
is a great chassis stiffening device for open cars such as 914s and targas.
 Why spen big$s on suspension upgrades if the effectiveness of the upgrade is
being partially absorbed in chassis twist?
Lastly, all of the above was theory until the 1993 SCCA runoffs when a
showroom stock car rolled voilently punching the Autopower cage through the
floor.  I can't tell you the brand of car and I was not there but I had
several friends in SS classes at that event who relayed this information to
me.  My understanding is that the driver was injured as a result of the
failure.  Keep in mind the cage itself did not fail, the mounting system was
inadequate and the roll over protection system failed.
My feeling is that safety is prime when driving track whether it be drivers
ed or wheel to wheel.  Why try to save a few (even a few hundred) bucks and a
few hours installation time on a product just to perhaps "meet the rules".
 You've already spent the money for the best car, protect yourself with the
best cage.  Go with the Race-Tech (or Safety Devices who as a matter of
interest is owned by Matter, who provide the factory cages for Cup cars etc.)

Keep the shiny side up

Phil et al:

I wasn't going to post this to the list originally but the question has been
asked a couple of times.
At Sebring, the Chief Steward (moi) started hearing more and more reports
from workers, (primarily tech and pit & grid) about being treated rudely by
drivers and crew members.  Combing this with what I felt was a higher degree
of rude driving for this type of event, Sunday morning I turned my normally
mild mannered hat around and addressed the group at the driver's meeting in
my best Chief Stewards voice.  The summary of what I said was that these
workers donate their time, at their own expense to make events like this
possible, and give the drivers a place to play.  That there wasn't a person
in the room who had the right to verbally abuse a worker no matter how
frustrated they were and if it happened again the offending party would be on
the trailer.  If they had a problem they could discuss it with me or the
National Tech Steward in a conversational tone of voice and we would get it
handled.  Turned my hat around and got on with the rest of the meeting.
Normally this isn't a problem.  Maybe there's something in the Florida water.

I've been looking for an extra set of wheels for my car lately.
I've just come across a set of phone dials locally.  Supposedly
they're from an '89 951, but I thought that all the '89s came

The owner wants $600 for the set.  He also has a set of Comp T/As
with less than 2000 miles for the rear wheels that he will give
me a "good price" on - though he hasn't stated a price yet.
This would be great since I planned on putting Comp T/As on 
anyways.  Is this a good deal, or just a fair deal?  What is the
deal with phone dials on an '89 951?  Will these fit my car?

Subject: today's 928 electrical puzzle


	This past weekend, i did the oil change, tune-up thing on 'The Pig'
('79 928).  Two rather interesting occurances were observed:

	i decided to try spark plugs other than Bosch Platinums, since it seems
like the Platinums' perfomance drops off after a few thousand miles, a slight
roughness in the 1/8 to 1/4 throttle, light load regime.  so i bought 
Champions.
well, driving the car to work yesterday with the Champions in it was a rude
awakening; it ran worse at light load! at heavy throttle, it runs real 
good, but
at light throttle, light load, it misses like crazy. i went home last 
night, regapped
the plugs down a notch (from the specified 0.71mm to 0.63mm) and drove it
up and down the road- no change. so i cleaned the old Bosch's up, and re-gapped
them to 0.71mm and put them back in- not great, but about like they 
were before.
hmm. are the Champions just shit, or did i get the wrong plugs for my car? the
Bosch's are  WR8DP and the Champions are RN11YC.

	also, on the way to work yesterday, the 'ENGINE OIL' light began flashing,
followed immediately by a sharp rise in heart rate and BP (mine, not 
the car's!).
some research indicated that this is a low oil level warning. hmm, i thought i
put the normal 8 qts. back in, check it, its OK. so i start looking at 
the sensor.
ah, look, a broken wire! ok, fix that, take it for a drive. now the oil 
warning light
only flashes going up a hill, or accelerating. go home read the manual 
some more.
OK, the central warning brain is only supposed to care about the oil 
level sensor
when the key is on and the engine 'stationary' (german for 'not 
running'?). so, i
conclude that the central warning box is confused about when the engine 
is running.
i pull the dead pedal, and look at the connectors. well, lookee there, 
there's a
connecter backed out of the connector block. i put it back and go to 
bed. driving
to work this am proves that the problem still exists. what i'm 
concluding is that
the wire to the sensor has been broken a long time (perhaps by the previous
owner, in response to symptoms like i'm seeing)?  $64 question: does anyone
know how the central warning system brain knows whether or not the engine is
running? could all of this be caused by the classic 'bad ground'?

	thanks for any ideas you might have.

All the 89 944 Turbos came with the forged alloy wheels, 7.5x16 front and

Stan 

Think of a number then multiply it by 10

The revenue that British Telecom alone make from bandwidth sales to 
internet users exceeds 120m dollars. then there are all the other 
suppliers...

Currently we all scrounge bandwidth from our employers or whoever. Sooner 
or later our employers will wise up and start putting traffic monitors on 
the LANs so that they can start charging individual depts. When that 
happens the boss will start looking at how he can cut his dept spend - 
before you know it cisco will bring out routers that can be programmed to 
reject packets to http servers etc etc....

So I guess there is some sort of trade off on how big you can let any 
list grow, there may also be be some natural limit. If a list gets too 
big, the number of posts grows, and the number of broadcasts grows, so 
you have a square law working.

If the list gets too big, then the postings each user receives gets 
beyond what he can view in a lunch break, at this point, I guess some 
users will start to un-subscribe.

For me I think the limit is probably close right now, I scan the list and 
dump unread all the posts on certain categories ( apart from those with 
obvious entertainment value), and that still takes half hour.

I think from the above it is fairly clear that a 5000 member list would 
be impossible, so you may need to think about splitting the list into 
model specific lists, perhaps 911, 914/944/928, 356/C912/914, and general 
interest -
for me I could then subscribe to 944 and general, and expect to get 30 
mails per day. 

This should half the bandwidth requirement, but obviously would need 
slightly more administration.

Perhaps there would then be scope for someone taking over running one of 
these sub-lists on another server.

Another possible way forward - lots of work for Stan, would be to make it 
possible to register a limitted group interest, so that pfilers could 
register interest groups, and then postings could be given the 
appropriate subject and distributed as reqd, I haven't played with elm, 
so I am unsure how much work is involved.

Which ever way you decide to go Stan, you have my thanks for the great 
work you have done.

What about the connectors? Is there any thing special with the spark plug 
wire and distributor cap connectors? Maybe that's why they cost so much.

By the way, I bought some Accel wires, cut off the original connectors, and 
with the help of my brother, soldered the connectors onto the Accel 
wires. The car runs much smoother now.

    If you are going to run a Sandblaster (or probably a beadblaster) even
   5hp isn't enough to really keep going. But I replaced my 2.5hp with

I had my 84 911 aligned by a san jose shop. I told him my weight and filled

much better. It has been lowered about 1". I have adjustable spring plates
which made balancing much easier. The corners are now within 20 lbs from each

What the bigger tank and higher pressure give you is a longer cycle between
runs of the compressor.  Its pure physics.  If you are using 4 cfm at 60 psi,
and you have either 60 gal of air at 120 psi or 100 gal of air at 160 psi,
which one do you think is going to take longer to drain?

FWIW I had a 5 hp single stage 60 gal, and up graded to a horizontal 120
gallon 10 hp 2 stage last year (bought used from garage that went out of
busines).  Now I hardly ever get the compressor to run except when starting
out or when running a DA sander (takes 9.8 cfm at 90 psi)

What you really want to look at is CFM of air at a given pressure, 90 psi
being frequently specified and a useful value. This has been beaten to
death in many other forums, but "4 HP" motors running off 115 V. lines
is simply not realistic. The high HP values come from creative specification
approaches. I haven't heard of anyone finding a way to distort CFM values
yet. 

230 V. operation is definitely a good idea, for anything above perhaps
1 or 1.5 HP.

From my observation of CFM values at 90 PSI, 2-stage compressors do
in fact produce more air at a given HP rating (if you think you have
found a HP rating you are willing to believe).

A larger tank is nice if you expect to do jobs where the air flow needs
exceed the compressor output. Sandblasting is a possible example. The
larger tank then allows a longer "operate" period before you wait for
the compressor to catch up. If you buy a relatively high CFM compressor
this may not be a big issue, but most (all?) of those come with a big
tank anyway.

I would also look for a good brand name as an indication of the expected
life of the compressor unit itself, although I'm mot sure that the
better names aren't now buying "cheap" compressor heads for their
lower cost models.

An ASME tank is nice, if that helps you sleep better at night.

When aligning or corner weighting, you ideally want the car in the
condition it will be run.  So that means driver in the car, and preferably
nothing in the cubbies/trunk which you would remove when running
it.  If you like to autocross on vapors, align/CW the car with an empty
tank.  If you do track events with a full tank of gas in the morning and
not much left by 5PM, align/CW with a half tank.

Having spend alot of time evaluating compressors [thinking about
sandblasting] beware of the 'rated' HP of these units.  The number
you are really interested in is how many cubic feet per minute (CFM)
that a given unit can pump.

You can get a cheap 5HP compressor for < $400, but it will
pump less then 10CFM.  If you do lots of DA sanding or use a die
grinder with wire wheel to remove LOTS of rust - this really isn't
enough ;-( (experience).  On the other hand you can get a 5 HP that pumps
15+ CFM, but it will run you more then $800 or so.

The big tank is usefull for 'reserve' pressure.  Ideally the 
compresser will be able to keep the tank up to pressure even when you
are working - so you never get below operating pressure.

If you are doing high-volume work I would suggest the two stage units
as they pump lots more air.  The compressor I would love to have
is a 7.5 HP 2 stage compress with 80 gallon tank that pumps 22 CFM
per minute.  That I won't be able to get ahead off - NEVER!  The
rating on 2 stage compressors usually is at a higher CFM, which is
what you really want, but not necessarily - so check the numbers.

If your compressor can keep the tank at 175 psi instead of 125psi
you have LOTS more air in the tank waiting to get used.  Very 
important!

Yup - The 220 volt compressor are lots cheaper to run, and in fact
the larger compressors (15+ CFM) can suck up to 30 Amps of 220 Volt.
Big motors :-)

Right now I am dong what Lee is - hooking up two smaller compressors
to drive all the air tools: impact guns, da sander, die grinder,
tire changer, etc.  And I spend too much time waiting for the compressor
to spool up :-(.

First, don't worry about 100,000.  There is only funding for about 25,000.
And that number goes down 20% a year until they're gone.  But anyway,
what you do about lack of jail space for real criminals is you eliminate
'consensual crimes' which jail non-violent non-criminals.  By far the most
important is to get rid of all drug laws.  Some 18 year-old caught with
some arbitrary amount of a drug gets a 'mandatory minimum' while people
who commit the drive by shootings can name names and get off or get a 
light sentence.
Drug prohibition doesn't work and when the prices go up for the illegal
material, you get businesses operating outside the law who have to have
their own enforcement.  Besides, it's immoral to tell people what they
can and can't put in their bodies as long as they're not harming others.

The lack of jail space problem is very simle. Just build more jails. Don't buy 
more cops/law enforement, just plain build all the jail space we could ever

Subject: Re: Rear View mirror adhesive


It depends on what year mirror.  The later ones ('78 on?) have a round
metal disk, which uses the standard Loctite mirror adhesive (take the
mirror off and sand the disk before attempting to attach).

The earlier ones have a black adhesive pad.  You can do as I did when
I didn't know better--take it to a glass shop; they'll sand the
trapezoidal surface to flat, bare metal and use the above adhesive.  Or you
can get a replacement adhesive pad (Tweeks, Stoddard, etc.--I like
Stoddard because they don't pad their shipping charges).

Or you can update your mirror to the later type.  That's a more
expensive solution.

BTW, I have a spare pad and mirror just in case the same thing happens
again, or if I have to replace my windshield.

I had tried a number of adhesives without much success for my '81 911.
Then I decided to ask the dealer if they carry the adhesive strip that
attaches the rear view mirror to the windshield.  Indeed they do, and
it only cost a couple of bucks.

Subject: Re: Corner weighting

I assume that you are corner weighting a car to race it. If not, you will
have adjustable SPRINGS to set the corner weiights with.

We used to do this on a race car and it is done as it was meant to be driven
so we put half a tank of gas and a weight equivalent to the driver in it.
Then we adjusted the suspension so that the cornerweights side to side were
equal. This is done by raising and lowering collars on screw threads on the
suspension which raised and or lowered the corner. This adjusted the weight.

Hope it helps

I used to have a Mercedes that would turn it's own brake lights
on and off at random, whether the car was occupied or not. My
wife was watching the random blinking from the living room window 
one time and decided that the car was posessed. It took me a 
loonnnng time to track down the problem, and I finally found it 
with a short detector made by KD and dumb luck. It turned out to 
be a cut in the wiring harness above the driver's window - 
probably caused by a slip of the knife when Fritz installed the 
headliner after too much of that vending machine Pils. It wasn't 
apparent by looking at the skinned wires why there should be a 
problem - transient electropositronical transmigrography perhaps - 
but I taped it up and the problem went away.

Hi everybody, 
 
         Just thought I would let everybody know that I took part in my 
first autocross last saturday organized by the Golden Gate Region PCA. 
Boy! Did I have a blast. 
         There were about 60 cars - mostly 911's and 914's, one RS, one 
930, one 928 and two 944's. Initially I felt a little odd 'coz I looked 
like the most unprepared( for the autoX)  guy while others had their 
track-only cars or atleast track tires  and me with  my 215-60-HR 15 
RE-71 road  tires .  My  best  time  was  43  seconds  ( a 5  second 
improvement over my worst ie first run) and almost everybody was doing 
40 secs with some people doing 37 secs. I discovered a completly new 
driving experience though I an not anywhere near mastering driving at 
the limits. I thought driving at the limit was driving with the tires 
squealing. I have also enrolled in the 2 day drivers ed & autoX school 
in May. 
          Now for the reason for my 43+ second runs:SABOTAGE!! Someone

The funniest auto electrical glitch around here was a former co-worker's
Jaguar sedan.  It had electric side mirrors that would wink if you shut the
driver side door a little to hard.  The mirror would auto-adjust until it
hit its limit switch and then return to its normal position, then back to
the limit, then to normal and so on until the owner finally saw it and
wandered out to open and shut the door.  On a sunny day, it looked like the
car was winking.  I think the car was sensitive about having its doors slammed.

Yeah. Countries populated by double amputee midgets (oops, sorry,
"vertically challenged nonopods") who like sitting in rows
of 20. Must be one of those evolutions of the third-world tour bus, which
is only 2 meters long but 30 meters wide because they all want to sit up
front with the driver.
 
Every Airbus I've ever been in (and there have been a few) struck me as
being the airborne version of the Yugo. Or, to put it in Western European
terms, the Mini Metro or Renault 5 or Ford Fiesta or Fiat Panda or... or...
Yes! I've got it! The Goggomobil!
 
I might accept the Airbus if 1) they put more engines on it (yeah, I know,
the new Boeings are doing the same thing) and 2) they stopped trying to
stack passengers like cordwood in interiors built by low-bid contractors. As
far as I'm concerned, there is nothing to beat a 747 for long hauls, and a
737/57/67 for domestic flights. IMHO. YMMV. FBI/KGB. UNESCO. Etc. The Airbus
(any one of them ) and McDonnell-Douglas DC-10/MD-11 could have a showdown to
decide worst big airplane honors.
 
Pacers, BTW, are now collectors' items. One, because there are nearly none
left alive in the wild (and there's a reason); two, because of the movie
"Wayne's World." The Flying Fishbowl lives! Besides, doesn't it share
parts with the 924 (running, ducking...)
 
Is the conveyor at DIA a German design? I heard BAE, thought "British
Aerospace." OK, so it's German. Germans probably mess up just as often as
the British but are better at covering it up (better at following boss'
orders to shut up and deny...) The British just own up to it
and figure they'll "muddle through" somehow. My next door neighbor used to
work for a British boss who was very proud of the fact that no project he
ever worked on went into production (missles/aerospace).

Sreelal,

I was there. I drive a silver '78 911SC Targa with a '77 Turbo tail. I ran
in the "odd" run group (1st  to run).

Henry Watts and I battled it out for the TTOD 911 honors. In fact no other
911 was within a second of us. My first run of the day was with a student
(Hank has me teaching already) so I took it easy. It was cold out and the
course was dirty. It felt like I had tires made out of concrete!!  There
was no turn-in at all. This I attributed to shortness of the course (no
time for the tires to warm), the cool weather, and dirty track (I was the
third car out). I did a 37.7xx. My next run, without the student, was a
little faster 37.6xx, but I hit a cone. Still had no turn-in and the tires
we still cold to the touch. Hank was only a little faster with a lower
37.6xx and with a cone like me.

Thank God the sun came out!! My next run came after lunch. The course had
warmed up and been cleaned off. My first run was a 36.5xx with no cones.
Hank went out and beat my time with a 35.8xx. My next run I did a 35.7xx
(the tires were warming up). Hank then did a 35.5xx. I did not have high
hopes of matching this time. For my last run, I did a 35.4xx. They tried
to give me a cone but it was from my practice lap so the 35.4xx stood.

Before my last run, Hank and had discussed him taking my car out if I did
not beat his time. He decided to take my car anyway...I was somewhat
suprised by this decision. Hank also had a cold....

While I was at Rodent Track, we had a Sterling (British copy of Acura
Legend, but with Lucasbits or equivalent thrown in for good measure). With
the radio turned off (CLICKED off, not just with volume down), you could
hear the last selected radio station in the left door speaker, keeping time
with the turn signal when the left turn signal was turned on. But not the
right turn signal.
 
I once saw a 924 in the Porsche parking lot with some sort of electrical
problem. Car locked, key out of ignition, owner already at work, the car
would continuously raise and lower its headlights. Up, down. Up, down. Until
they found the owner, and he pulled the fuse.
 
One of my favorite non-electrical problems was a one-year test of a Saab
(900? 9000?) at Rodent Track. It went through three transmissions in less
than a year. The last straw was when somebody went for the shift lever, the
shift knob disconnected itself from the shaft, and the reverse lockout
spring sent it sailing out through the open sunroof, never to be seen again.
At that point they gave the car back. Saab never could make decent
transmissions (personal experience with Saab 97/Sonnett confirms this).

Subject: Air Compressors

Althought this might have been said by someone else...


There is a difference between oil-less and oil compressors. Oil-less are
lower maintenance and do not require a separate filter before your spray
gun (but unless you live in Arizona you will need a filter anyway to get
rid of the condensation). However, oil-less require overhauls sooner than
those that use oil (assuming you remember to keep them filled with oil...).
I have also been told (no experience here) that having a compressor that
takes oil reduces the amount of oil you need to feed your air tools to
prevent them from wearing out. Every air tool that I have has a separate
oil feeder between the compressor and the tool to ensure that the tools are
lubricated.


I ended up buying a sears 6hp compressor oil-less (the largest you can run
on 220) and still regret that I didn't get a bigger one! When ever I use my
DA sander the compressor is on continuously! If you look for the Craftsmans
days you can get an extra 10-15% which helps to put a bigger compressor in
your garage!

Hi Rich -

You didn't mention what kind of Weber carb's you had, but if they are 
anything like mine (40IDF's) then those tubes sticking out of the top are 
called "emulsion tubes".  The tubes hold the main jet (bottom pointed 
piece towards intakes manifolds) and the air correction jet (hidden 
inside the top of the tube after you remove emulsion tube holder which is 
just a tight fit like the main jet.  The emulsion tube is set by the 
situation of the use of the carbs (generally) and then the jets are 
adjusted per situation as needed (like altitude/temperature/humidity).  
Aagain, this is very basic information and is not to be taken as final as 
all different cars and situations require different jets, emulsion tubes 
or air correction jets.  BTW, the idle jet is located elsewhere in the 
carburetor.

If I'm wrong with this I am sure someone will correct you and me!

For more information about the Weber carbs I suggest you purchase the 
Haynes book on Weber Carburetors.

I'm probably running behine in the posts on "the philes", and somebody
smarter than me (99% out there?) correct me if I'm wrong, but the equations
E=IR and P=EI comes to mind.  You'll probably not notice much difference in
your electric bill by using 220V. 
     P = Power used measured in watts (usually billed in kWs)
     E = Electromative force (voltage)
     I = Current (amps) If you check the spec tag on the electric motor of
the comp (or whatever else) you'll in most cases see that you'll use the same
'wattage'. The 220 gear usually runs on half the amperage  of running the
same equipment on 115.  Equated (is that a real word?) out, the billed
wattage will be , for all praticle purposes, the same. A 220 unit will
probably "spool" up easier and maybe be a little more efficient (maybe also
because they're usually more expensive they'll last longer), but again for
the price differential of the original prices (115 vs 220) cost of operation
is generally the same. 

I do concur that the CFM or SCFM is of major concern. If you're going to use
high volume air consuming tools, it's really necessary to purchase probably
 at LEAST a 10CFM machine. I weld for an occupation (Don't tell my MOM. She
thinks I'm a piano player in a Whore house.) and I do need at least decent
air delivery for even the basic tools I use (I.E. - die grinders. bead
blaster , etc.)

I hope any of this can be of any help.

Not least of which was the rather illegal yearly payment that Lucas made

in Lucas having (with the exception of FoMoCo) a monopoly on the british

The 66 911 (at least some of them) came with a wood wheel (I have one
laying around, if anyone wants to make an offer). I don't know if the
912 of the same year used the same wheel. The car this came off also

uh, yeah right.  then why did the wwii best us single engine fighter
p-51 (which was shit until the d model) use a british (rolls) engine ?

and why was it STILL outrun by the british equivelent the spit ?

and why did the raf laugh at the 8 th air-force - because the b-17
was a shit airplane until very late in the war.  it's had a pitifuly
small payload - infact it carried more weight in defensive
payload (bullits) then it carried in bombs !  anybody here say lancaster ?

or whittle ?

and the first airplane to go supersonic dry (sans burners) ? again,
the ENGLISH electric lightning.

shall I continue ?

oh and the harrier...didn't macdonnel douglas have to "borrow" that one ?

Somethine I would like to get, and the simple ones really aren't that
expensive.  Getting wet air through your air lines is MUCH more
annoying!

Paul, I have a 5000CST and had the same problem with the hyd pump, 
leaking around the o-ring seals.  I would not recommed adding anything
to the mineral based fluid.  If you can, take the time to replace the 
O-rings.  It is relativly simple and the kit is about $30.00 at the
dealer.  I have heard of some lower cost kits via mail order.

The big tank gives you a more consistent feed pressure. High volume in the
feed lines also helps in that regard (1-1/2" pipes). The converse is that
it takes longer to come up to pressure.

I've had to crank the pressure up to 125 at times to get enough effect from
the impact wrench. Naturally, I realize that the wrench is rated at 90psi and
this will shorten its life...

>     I do suggest 230 volt operation at 4hp and above.

Unless you cheat (like by using an illegal circuit breaker) you can't
get more than 2.5 hp from a 110 volt line.

Subject: 924s & Pacers?  I think not...

Greetings Porsche dwellers,
	Responding to Pete's idea about 924 and Pacers sharing parts, I 
think he's a bit confused.  First of all, the "parts" (meaning engine) 
referred to are found in either a '77 or '78 Gremlin or Concorde, not the 
Pacer.  According to my research, AMC used the original Audi carbureted  
engine, which is what Porsche BASED its design on.  The engine was 
significantly reworked for the 924 and as I understand it NO parts are 
interchangeable.  I looked at an Audi engined Gremlin once, and while 
some things looked familiar, like the timing belt cover, everything else 
looked much different than my 924.  If I'm wrong about this please let me 
know.

Maybe this has already been discussed many times.  If so, simply ignore

`What are the main advantages of air cooling a motor ?'

My opinion is that:
 - it's easier to design,
 - it increases power since there's no water pump to move,
 - it reduces the weight.

If so, why don't we see more air-cooled cars ?

Is there a *big* default with this design I forget ?
... like an erractic fuel consumption because the motor is not running at
a constant temperature ?

My 86 944 is starting to run real hot about 3/4 on gauge. If I run heater full blast it will drop down to 1/2. I notice
performance products recommends low temp thermostat and switch, improved water pump and improved radiator to bring temp gauge to 1/4 point. With hot weather approaching any suggestions would be appreciated. What exactly is improved water pump? Does the old one stop moving enough water? Or does plastic/alum rad loose heat transfer ability?
I see water pumps go as low as $110 but rads are around 450 ouch dollars. I thought of pulling the thermostat but don't see how that would help. thanks in advance for any replies. Rodger

        Watts is a very, very, very good driver.  (Did I mention "very"?)
In fact, he literally "wrote the book".  If you haven't seen _Secrets of

autocrosser, and also seems to be helpful even for experienced racers.
Probably Time Trialers as well--but I ain't done that stuff yet, so I
don't know for sure...  He is the Zone 7 Chief Instructor, whatever that
means.  He's a good instructor, and *really* knows how to organize a
school.
        Hmm...  Add a couple more "very"s to that first sentence...  8)
As I said, most people are happy if Hank *only* beats them by a second in
their *own* car!  So beating him and his "race" car (the Elf, pictured on
the cover of the abovementioned book) is quite an acheivement!

It isn't. Not really. You still have to worry about most of the
same issues, and the thermodynamic analysis is no less complex.
The parts count may be lower, and you don't have to design coolant
galleys, but you have to design air flow, shrouding, thermostats, etc.

But there's more air flow needed, so you need a bigger (more power-depleting)
fan.

Maybe. You don't have the coolant and you don't have the radiator, but
you have to put fins on the cylinders, and the oil cooler has to be
more effective.

> If so, why don't we see more air-cooled cars ?
> Is there a *big* default with this design I forget ?

Noise is an issue in air-cooled vs. water-cooled motorcycles -
the two-strokes that I used to love are now all water-cooled 
primarily for this reason. Specific power vs. cooling capacity
also appears to have its limitations.

There is a difference between generic parts and factory parts, 
often a huge difference. If you get the factory part, you know it's 
gonna be the right part for the right car, not a part for a totally 
different car adapted to work on your car. German cars are often 
set up quite different from American cars, and a lot of wear items 
rarely, if ever, need replacing on German cars (ie, spark plug 
wires, radiator hoses, etc.)
I think if you guys would check into it, you'd find that your dealer 
is not as outrageous as you might think on a lot of stuff - in fact, 
I've compared a lot of dealer prices to prices from aftermarket 
Porsche supply houses, and in the majority of the ones I checked, 
the dealer retail was less - something, significantly less.

Anyways, to make a long post short, you get what you pay for.

Subject: Odd shifting 86 Carrera

Like Mike, I also have been having trouble with shifting my 86 Carrera in
gears 1 & 2. 
I bought the car with 112,xxx miles on it, and figured it was the synchros.
When my clutch failed, I had the dealership [big mistake I now know] take a
look in the tranny and prepare to replace the sychros. As I plan to autocross
the car, I wanted a tranny in top condition. The repair order called for
replacing gears 1-3 and reverse. ARGH. The service rep said they could just
replace the "dog teeth" pre-gears for much less, and it would essentially be
the same. I said OK and after over $3K [not counting the clutch cable I had
to replace later], 4K miles and six months, it still shifts roughly.

I brought it back in and they said that they found metal shavings at the
drain plug, and I probably need the new gears anyway! Also the "dog teeth"
were not Porsche parts, so the usual warranty is null and void. When I
protested, the threw around the word "abuse".

The car simply does not shift smoothly and consistantly. I never shift into
1st without going thru 2nd and only while stopped, yet sometimes I cannot get
into 1st and other times its 2nd. Periodically, when upshifting, I need lots
of force to shift into second. 

Another mechanic seems to think it is the shifter. I had Porsche install a
short shift kit with the tranny work, but I feel no difference. I think I
have been screwed. I plan on writing PCNA and cc'ing Excellence, PCA and the
local newspaper. I plan on getting this examined more closely, but am
rightfully short on funds.
Any advice?

service dept. at all costs.

Here comes the torch.  I'm sure that most know that the Tiptronic is very 
similar to the electronic transmisions currently used in Formula 1 racing where 
gears can be changed with the flip of a stearing wheel mounted switch.  Granted 
that the Porsche Tiptronic has two modes - automatic and manual (by wire) 
shifting.  I have not personaly experienced this machine but have been told by 
those that have, that there is greater control going into and coming out of 
turns, not to mention the additional safety of shifting with both hands on the 
wheel.  If anyone can, Porsche will redefine "sports car".

Hi everyone.
Can someone recommend a good source of info on Porsche racing cars 
(current models), special editions, and other limited production-type 
Porsches?

I'm not a PCA member (no Porsche... :(  ), so I can't get Panorama. Can I 
get Christophorus as a non-Porsche owner? How is Christophorus, and can 
someone mail me the subscription info? I know I can probably get it from 
the FAQ, but I can't get to an FTP terminal at night and I don't want to 
wait until the monthly posting comes around. What do you all think of 
Excellence? European Car? (I don't like this one)

Ob Porsche comment: I saw a beautiful, brand-new, silver (don't know the 
factory color name) 1995 Carrera 4 last night. Is it just me, or has 
Porsche's paint quality improved over the last few years? This car had 
the nicest paint job I've seen, except for possibly a Mercedes-Benz. I 
want this car!!!!

Subject: Re: Air cooled motors: why ?


In addition to what John L. mentions, I'm aware of a couple of other
limitations.  First has to do with emissions and mileage.  Apparently
there are limits in an air-cooled engine.  I am not sure what the reasons
are for these, but suspect they may have to do with component
temperatures (limit comression ratios?).

The second is multi-valving.  You cannot multi-valve an air cooled
engine.

It also seems true that a loss of air cooling has much quicker and
fatal consequences than, say, a water pump failure.  If you throw a
fan belt in a 911, esp. at the track, bad things happen very quickly.
Perhaps this is simply a 911 quirk.

Subject: RE: Have '86 944  overheating any suggestions plz


Rodger,

You probably don't need all those expensive parts.  You mention that
your car has started running hot.  Did you perform (or have performed)
any significant service to the car recently?  If so, perhaps something
there explains the problem -- perhaps the coolant was changed but not
fully bled.

If not, the first thing to do is check the coolant thermostat, which inserts 
into
the neck of your water pump.  They do fail with age, and are straightforward
to replace.  You can take the old one out, check it with a pot of water
and cooking thermometer on your stove.  But as a practical matter, get
a new one, pop it in, and be done with it.  They're cheap.

What happens when the thermostat fails is that it does not open (enough),
allowing coolant running through the engine to circulate through the
radiator.  During warm-up, the radiator is bypassed so that the coolant
isn't cooled, which speeds up the process of bring the whole engine into
its ideal operating temperature range.

(911's do the same thing with their oil thermostat, bypassing the cooling
loop or radiator.  And 944 Turbos have an oil thermostat built into their
oil filter base.  Both of these guys also fail.  However, unless you have
been clever enough to fit an oil temp sender and gauge to your car,
you might never know about a failure with a 944 Turbo.  I had a case
last winter where my oil thermostat failed open, and my oil temp would
never get above 120F, even after a long drive.  Putting my hand on the
warm oil radiator convinced me of what was wrong.)

In replacing the coolant thermostat, you'll have to know which version
of the water pump you have in your car.  The newer pumps take a
different spacing rubber ring.  This is covered in a tech bulletin which is
reprinted in the EuroSelect catalog.

You mention pricing and sources.  I would avoid EuroSelect rebuilt pumps
if it comes to that.  I had my hands on one a few months ago, and it looks
like a real piece of shit.  They go so far (such as that is) as to spray 
paint
it silver to make it look swell.  It ain't.  Sell your old one back to 
Porsche.
Last time I checked they were paying $100 for cores, regardless of whether
you bought a new part from them.

Radiators can get clogged and fail.  I don't have any personal experience
with that sort of failure; they seem to last pretty well if you change the
coolant annually.

Sorry for rattling on so long.  Massive build going on in another window,
and time on my hands...

I've been on a few 757/67 flights and they were OK. I didn't notice anything

on most of my 757 flights I had an entire row to myself or I flew first

Roger A. Freeman, "Mustang at War," p. 20-21: "Flight tests in Britain
showed that war equipped and loaded, the Mustang I [with your despised
Allison engine, I might add] could consistently attain a top speed of 375
mph at 15,000 feet, 35 mph faster than the RAF's standard low/medium
altitude fighter of the day, the Spitfire V. The Mustang was heavier than
the Spitfire V -- around 8600 lbs. loaded as against 6,900 lbs... above
15,000 ft, the Mustang fell away due to lack of any supercharging on the
Allison."  "During February [1942] they were pitted against the RAF
Spitfires and other types in comparison tests from which the Mustang emerged
with a great deal of credit and little in default. The report rated the
aircraft with a high standard of manufacture with good servicing
facilities." [From what I've read, the Spitfire was a kludge by comparison.]
"Its four hour endurance was about double that of the Spitfire or other
contemporary single-engine fighters." "In comparison tests the Mustang
proved faster than the Spitfire VB in level flight up to 20,000 feet."
 
p. 52: "This design study credited the Merlin 61-powered version of the
Mustang with a performance equal to, or better than, a Spitfire using the
same engine."  p. 53: "Manufacture of the Merlin in the USA had been
arranged during 1940 and by 1942 this engine was in full production at the
Packard factory in Detroit." The P51 did not use a Rolls-Royce engine; it
used a mass produced, American-built engine of Rolls-Royce DESIGN.

The USAAF carried that many, uh, "bullits" because they usually had to fight
their way TO the target, and then BACK again, in daylight. RAF Bomber Command
had no such problem: go at night, when you can't find the radar-equipped enemy
fighters anyway until his tracers find YOU -- hope the radar flak doesn't
get you, dump your bombs in the general vicinity of a large city, and go home.
 
Lancaster I bomb load -- max 18,000 lbs., service ceiling 22,000 ft.
Lancaster II bomb load -- max. 14,000 lbs. Service ceiling 18,500 ft.
B17 E&F -- 8000 lbs. Service ceiling unknown but top speed is at 25,000 ft.
B17G as of Sept. 43 (NOT that "late in the war"), 16,000 lbs., service
ceiling 35,600 ft; the B-17G could operate at 25,000 ft for 6 hours.
The 8th AF routinely flew up around 30,000 ft.
 
There is a big difference between carrying bombs to the mid-teens, nearly
unopposed, at night, and carrying them to more than twice that altitude, in
daylight, against an entire hostile air force full of FW190s and Bf109Gs,
where pilots with over 100 kills were not unusual. Most USAAF crews did not
survive to their 25th mission, winding up in POW camps. Many RAF crews
survived an entire war of night missions.
 
But if you want to play hardball, with equipment of the same era,
B29 -- 16,000 lbs over longer distances, or any nukes you happen to have...
 
Whittle -- Very nice but he kilt hisself in his own device and the Me-262
went into service sooner. Everybody got jets at about the same time,

Component temps is part of it. You can't run lean-burn on an engine
for which the latent heat of vaporization of the (richer) fuel has already
been taken into account in designing the cooling system.

No, that's a generic air cooled quirk. Water cooled engines can boil off
a fair bit of coolant before the temperature starts to soar. Air cooled
engines can't boil anything (except maybe the oil, in which case "too late").

Subject: 911 Test Drive

This past weekend I had the opportunity to test drive a couple of 911s.
I test drove 86, 87 and 89 model years. I found the 86 to be extremely
dificult to shift. When I was down shifting I kept missing the gears.
The car had only 26K miles on it. I had no trouble with the 87 or 89.

I read that Porsche changed to the G50 transmission in 87, but I didn't
think it would make that big a difference. Are the pre-87 transmission
prone to failure at such a low mileage? Since that test drive I've been
focusing on 87 thru 89 911s. However, there seem to be alot more 84-86 
avalable. Was this just an isolated case or are the 915 transmissions
less reliable than the G50s?

pretty funny Reid.
 
Strangest auto electrical problem I have dealt with was while
installing an aftermarket tape deck/radio in my RX-7 and trying
to get the automatic antenna to work. When I first hooked
it up, it would go down when I turned the radio on, and it would
go up when I turned the radio off. Finally fixed it by installing
a relay and changing the polarity of the signal from the radio
to the antenna.
 
p.s. i'm getting married in 2 weeks, then going on a honeymoon for
2 weeks, so my rebuild is stalled until I get back. 
 
During a full engine rebuild (2.2 911E), should I replace:
 
Valve adjusting screws 
rocker bushings
Camshaft timing gears 
Intermediate shaft gear(s)?
 
What should I look for on my cams to see if they're ok?
 
Thanks,

Sorry Pete,

Didn't mean to flame (or afterburner) you !  I've had a hectic and frustrating
day, wanted to fire off something quickly, perhaps that came through
as a flame.  This is, after all, a very "flat" medium (perhaps one
tends to read into it what one wants to hear ?:-)).

The intent of of my post was to rebuff the outragous comment that basically
everything English sucks and everything made in the US is the best.

I hope to get time soon to reply in detail to the rest of your message-
my reference materials are at home where I have no PC which makes it

Now where did I put those "bullits" :-> ?

OK, now you guys have me worried.  What are the fatal symptoms when I am
tooling along and the fan belt breaks.  Also, is it easily detectable from
in the drivers seat so that I can hit the breaks and save myself from
"bad things" ?  Additionally what are the "bad things" ?

Subject: Original Steering Wheel?

According to The 911 &912 Porsche, A Restorer's Guide To Authenticity:

The standard steering wheel on 912s was a black plastic-rimmed wheel, 
described as hard rubber and Ebonite in subsequent versions.  Also 
available as an option was a wood wheel similar to the standard 911 
wheel.  All wheels had four spokes and were 400 mm in diameter.  They 
were available in a "projecting hub" version.  Also available with a 
rectangular "butterfly" horn ring.  For more info check out the reference 
listed above.

My '66 912 has an aftermarket steering wheel, a Racemark.  It is a THICK 
leather covered wheel.  I like it a lot and when I finally restore my car 
it will be one of the few aftermarket items that I will include on the car.

Hope that helps.

Subject: RE: Odd shifting 86 Carrera


HSpiva,

Couple of bits of info.  First is that in the 911 gear boxes, the dog gears
are indeed replaceable separately from (and much cheaper than) the
main gear.  However, the separate dogs are *not* available from PCNA,
only in the aftermarket.  That the dealer offered you this path is pretty
progressive, I'd say.  Most wouldn't, although perhaps with the arrival
and acceptance of the EuroSelect line, dealerships may nowadays be
a little less dogmatic about non-factory parts.

I can understand them mentioning the word "abuse" if they found metal
in the drain.  Dog teeth don't fall off by themselves.

A short shift kit won't help.  In fact, it will hurt because the shorter 
throw
gives you less "dynamic range," for wont of a better term, in which to
feel the transmission engaging and disengaging.  I personally find the
gating of the 915 really close, and it doesn't surprise me that it people
mis-shift them as often as they seem to.

You may indeed have a shift linkage problem.  However, I can't imagine
not feeling the problem from the get-go after the original rebuild.  Did it
shift poorly right away, or was there a deterioration over time?

Hope this helps,

Kevin Gross

    AMC referred to this as a "Porsche" motor, not an Audi. In Gremlin
  tune it sported something like 80hp versus Porsches' 95hp. I've got both
  a 924 and a Gremlin engine in my garage (oh boy...). They are the same
  motor, the differences are in the fuel (single Holley 2 barrel, something 
  like 250 cfm I think)  for the Gremlin and ignition (Electronic for 
  Porsche). The plumbing around it is different, of course, and the Porsche
  includes a very beautfifully made cast-aluminum oil pan and valve cover 
  (both deep drawn steel on the Gremlin).

     The head differs in that Porsche taps the intakes for the fuel injectors.
  If you could find a 20-some millimeter tap you could convert the Gremlin
  head to a Porsche 924 head. Adapting the Gemlin carb and intake to the
  Porsche is possible but difficult, since the 924 mounted the engine at
  a 40' angle and the Gremlin sat straight up, the Gremlin intake will list
  out of the top of your hood.

     You can usually find parts cheaper if you quote the Gremlin application
   instead of the 924, of course. These are impressively stout motors on the
   bottom end, though, they look like they could have delivered some high RPM.

     The real bummer is that this was the -small- motor for the Gremlin.
  Its more likely that the Gremlin next to you at a stoplight has a 
  6-cylinder, so don't get cocky and race for pink slips.... :)

Subject: Should I Purchase this car?

I have an opportunity to purchase a 911 at a very good price. This car
started life as a '78 SC, and has been converted to 84+ Carerra specs. This
included the motor being updated to 3.2l with pressure fed cam chain tens.
When the engine was rebuilt, the head was ported and polished, and the
catalytic converter was removed. The rubber clutch has also been updated. I
don't know if the car has CIS, DME, or carbs.

The body was modified by adding a Carerra rear spoiler. The car has Carerra
Fuchs wheels, with Turbo tie rods and Turbo brakes. The suspension was also
upgraded, but I'm not exactly sure how. What are turbo tie rods?

The car was originally brown, but was repainted red some time ago. The paint
is in poor condition and definately needs to be repainted. The interior also
needs some work. It has some old Recaro cloth seats that have faded and have
some rips. The headliner is also coming down.

I can buy the car for about $10,000. What would a good paint job cost? how
about the interior work? Should I buy new seats, or get the Recaros
reupholstered? Also, in NY the emissions are tested. I ssume this means that
I will have to have a catalytic converter installed. How much is this?

One final question. I am selling my 86 944. I was originally going to
purchase a 944 S2 or Turbo S. How would the 911 compare in performance? This
car is not going to be my daily ride, so I am unconcerned with ride quality,
driving in bad weather conditions, etc. Which car would be faster on the
track, easier to drive, etc? 

Thanks in advance.

Subject: SWB suspension setups

Background:
I started to get some work done on my '66 911S, I wanted to raise up the rear
a bit (3/4"), get the front end a bit level (the drivers side is about 1"
higher) and put in a decent alignment in it.  

Everything is stock in the car, and the rear torsion bars were resting
against the top of the bushing mounts.  (IE I need to replace them)

Since I'm going to have to disassemble the whole thing, now is a good time to
change to bigger bars.  Stock has 19mm front and 22mm rear I believe.  This
car is mainly to bomb around on back roads and take to an occaisional
driver's event.  I'd prefer performance to comfort. 

Questions:

What is a good size rear tube to put in?  Should I go for the 23mm out of the
73-77?  25mm?  Because the car is a short wheel base, I don't want to go too
stiff, or I'll end up feeling like the teacup ride at Disneyland.

Does anyone have the specs on the 67 911R?  what was used in those?

How about a recommended size for the anti-sway bar?  It doesn't have one in
the back right now.   

If I add one, should I change the front?  if so to what size?

Shocks are yellow/orange Koni sports in the rear, Boge with Koni inserts in the
front (grey)

Last question, has anyone tried to put the turbo-tie rods on a pre 67?  will
this work?  I have both a set of originals and a set of turbo tie rods, both
unused.  I remember that this is a good thing to do, but not the reasons
behind it.

Thanks for the quick (hopefully) help in advance

Subject: Carrera 4 vs other AWD cars

Hi,

A couple of months ago there was a discussion of whether a Carrera 2 or 4
would be better in the snow. Well in the Feb. 10 issue of the German car
magazine, Auto, motor und Sport, there was a comparison test of 4 wheel drive
cars in the snow. They tested the Audi A8 4.2, Porsche Carrera 4, Range
Rover, Subaru Impreza and the Golf VR6 Synchro. The Carrera 4 came in last in
acceleration tests on snow: 0-30/kmh (3.3 sec) and 0-60/kmh (7.8 sec), but
first in braking. In acceleration tests on snow, they could spin the rear
wheels while the front tires didn't move. The testers complained that not
enough torque was being transferred to the front wheels and thought that
there was a problem with the viscous coupling but in subsequent tests with 2
other Carrera 4 the same thing happened. Auto, Motor und Sport spoke to the
head of development at Porsche, Horst Marchart who said, "Traction wasn't our
utmost priority in our all-wheel drive concept, but rather first class
handling." Which means that they wanted to avoid the understeer that plagued
the early Carrera 4. Their conclusion was that the Carrera 4 is an excellent
all-wheel drive car on dry and wet surfaces but on snow it handles more like
a rear wheel drive car. The authors also thought that the Carrera 4 was
probably oriented too much towards good handling rather than traction.

I'd take a Carrera 4 any day. I don't think poor traction in snow is too big
a problem for people who can afford the car in the first place. They can just
take out the Suburban or the Range Rover.

brings to mind the strangest flash I ever saw:

I was in Houston a few years ago, near downtown on Westheimer, when I
pulled up to a red light next to an old battered car full of skinheads.
They were all very agitated and wildly gesticulating toward me. I looked
straight ahead and ignored them until the light changed. At the next light,
I ended up behind a couple of carloads of foreigners in BMWs with
diplomatic plates. Now they were stuck next to the skinheads. The skinheads
couldn't seem to get their attention, and next thing I knew, a couple of
them were mooning the diplomats, with their cheeks pressed against
the windows.

I drove a tiptronic 968 before I bought my six-speed.  I really liked it.  
The real problem was that 4 forward gears in the tiptronic was not enough.  
It's a nice transmission though - very smooth.  It's also $3000 more than 
the six-speed. The six-speed, BTW, is *wonderful*.

		CYCLE WORLD'S DAVID EDWARDS VANISHES!

	"Motor Cycle News" of Great Britain, in concert with a consortium of
equally authoritative grocery store tabloids, is reporting that David Edwards,
editor of Cycle World, has been abducted by a team of extraterrestials on
day-glo PORSCHE motorcycles.
	 Early police reports point to industrial espionage as a possible motive,
as numerous confidential exclusive Cycle World documents were missing,
allegedly
including plans for Zangli Indian and Saab motorcycles. 
	Unconfirmed reports from highly placed sources say Edwards was last being
held in Peter Egan's Stoughton, Wisconsin garage by a Shining Path faction of
the Posse Commitatus, hypnotically controlled by Alien guards in Porsche Design
snowmobile suits.

Hi, Martin.
 
I didn't perceive it as a flame if you didn't intend it. Actually I enjoy
this sort of thing. So don't encourage me... <g> Do you realize I spent the
entire morning not working but looking through old airplane books? All your
fault.
 
No, not everything English sucks. That sort of attitude bugs me when it's
the other way around, too; I got plenty of that while working in Germany.
 
I'll grant you these:
Concorde
DH Mosquito; now THERE's a homebuilt!
EE Lightning if necessary
Maybe the Harrier but how different is US version?
More successful F1 cars than anybody else
Plenty of interesting sports racers
There's some place called Indy that uses lots of British stuff but that's
only because they plowed Brooklands under and they can't play ther no mo.
Nifty engines like the Bristol Pegasus and Napier Nomad and Sabre.
 
But for the life of me I can't think of a British production car that isn't
somehow a flawed design/execution. Even the E-type. And yes, the late
unlamented front drive Elan. In 9 years of testing, the only production car
I ever blew up while testing was a Lotus Europa.
 
Bullits should be put in dark green Ford Mustangs, preferably airborne with
Steve McQueen at the wheel. Mustang fastback or Shelby GT 350 -- now THAT's
a car. (Flames on...)

Everyone's perception of "difficult shifting" is probably a little different,
but I would not write off all pre-G50 cars unless you find that every 915
equipped car you test drive is "difficult to shift".  I myself have only
driven
a couple of 915-equipped cars that were "difficult" and these were obviously
the result of abuse.

On the contrary, I thought the 915s were pretty stout.  FWIW, my *very*

*that* much better than the 915s.

Second Mike Dayton's opinion on 915 comparison toG50. I had an 84 911 with
915, and now drive an 88 with G50. Can't say I notice a lot of difference in
the shift action (neither difficult ), but the hydraulic clutch with the G50
is certainly an improvement, especially if you do a lot of urban driving. The
G50 is supposedly a stronger design, but probably hasn't been around long
enough for reliability judgments.

Subject: British .. American  how things happen

Before we entirely condem British cars, one needs to look at some
of the reasons.  The Jaguar engine design was dictated by a rule
taxed the area of the pistons and not the displacement.  The result
was (and I think still is) very tall engines that have higher piston
speeds than almost anything around.  They also had a lot of kit cars
(i.e. Lotus 7) because the tax was lower.  Also, motorcycles were
taxed at lower rate than cars which gave us the Morgan 3-wheeler
among other things.

For those of you with machine shops (all good Porschephiles have
them, don't they), does your lathe use Morse tapers.  Do you
know why the different numbered sizes won't plug more or less
into a long tapered hole.  The design called for something like
5/8" taper per foot, but the first ones made were not accurate.
Since reproduction was initially done by hand fitting each size
has a unique taper.

No one gets it all right.  The Japanese produced a lot or very
little cars because of tax reasons.  It probably made sense.  I
once saw a Caddy coming down a little street in Kyoto.  People
had to move things back from the road to let it pass.

If "flush" is a verb used in conjunction with your car,  you don't own a
Porsche.  

1. What percentage of the cooling of an "air cooled" 911 is carried out by
the fluid medium of oil?
2. Oil ( Mobil 1) is $ 5.00 per quart.  The 911 takes 12 quarts per change
(oil FLUSH, if you prefer).  Now that works out to $ 60.00 and should be done
four times a year.  Lets see, that's a minimum of      $ 240.00 worth of
coolant per year. 
3. Anti-freeze is $ 6.00 per gallon.  Flush once a year and you have blown
 $12.00.

6. Porsche will fluid cool the next generation of 911 heads.  Do I hear a

I will agree with you on this but only to an extent. Any high quality wire
that is well shielded will get energy from point "a" to point "b". There
are certain applications (ignition wires, other high power wires, audio
interconnects, speaker cable) where is it benificial to have good low
oxygen copper that has a good jacket on it. The upper end of the Accel line
of ignition wires seem to be of good quality, and when used with OEM
connectors, I can't see why they wouldn't work (please correct me if i'm
wrong).

On the other hand, I agree that you should not use the $10/set bargain
ignition wires from Wall Mart. The good Accel wires are about $50/set,
which isn't bad compared to the OEM wire sets ...

just my $.02 worth !!!

Hi Gang:

Thanks for your many helpful replys to 71 T Questions.  It seemed that I got
quite a few responses from my trailer "66 911 - Parting Out".  So heres some
information for those of you interested.

I purchased a 66 911 to restore and drive.  The car was a very solid vehicle but
needed its share of TLC.  It was a Texas and Florida car all its life (where
it still rests today in many assorted pieces).  The pan and general
superstructure are in great shape.  The previous owner decided he was going to
race it and did some "interesting"  suspension mods.  1). Bumping up the
suspension pick-up points on the drivers side.  2) Arc welding a steel bar
across the shock towers.  I guess he was going to show those who didnt make
bars for the earlier upper shock mounts??  The car has a roll bar welded into
place and SC flares spot welded on the rear.  The suspension pan has now been
replaced and the shock towers have been put back to original condition (went to
PAR and MIGGED some out of an early car there)  The shell has been acid dipped
and is ready for final body prep and paint.  Theres plenty of parts that go
along with it.  Heres a partial list:

66 911 Shell (acid dipped, no rust) $800,  2.0 Engine 901/05 $1,700, 901
Transmission $600, 2.0/2.2 Headers w/Exhaust $150, BW Rocker Panels (new) $250,

 2/23/95       6:46 AM        Subject:    RE: air compressor size

Due to the high volume, I only have time to skim digests so I didn't get a
chance to see the original posting of this topic.  However, since I am on my
second compressor I may be able to contribute.  I apologize if this has been
already beat to death.
IMHO an air compressor is one of those tools that you don't realize how
valuable they are until you have one.  Even if you just use it to blow things
off and pump up tires a small air compressor is worth having.  The first air
compressor I bought was just a little 3/4 horsepower with an 8 gallon tank. 
It met most of my needs (blowing, tires, impact tools, occasional painting and
occasional sanding).  The main reason that I upgraded to a bigger compressor
was the peak pressure was only 90psi and there seemed to be a big difference
in the capability of the impact tools as the pressure dropped off.  
When I upgraded, I went to a 2 hp Campbell Hausfield direct drive that goes up
to 125 psi, and delivers 6.3 SCFM at 90 psi.  The reasons were:
1) size, space in my garage is very limited, bigger would have hard to
accommodate.
2) electrical power, 2 hp appeared to be the largest you can plug into 110V,
and I didn't want to have to wire a 230V outlet
3) cost,  obviously  larger would be more expensive.  I think I paid around
$200 dollars. 
Anyway, that was several years ago and I have been very happy with it.  It can
even  keep up with my sander (at about 60 psi).

At the risk of a flame, I'm passing on a quote from a fellow PCA

Porsche.

This isn't to say that I seriously subscribe to this notion, but
it represents a school of thought that's out there, and it's a
succinct way of putting it.

It's offered with tongue in cheek, hopefully not foot in mouth ;-).

There's an alternator light which comes on when the fan belt fails.  It
is basically invisible to any driving 'hors combat' at a track, but is a 
little
easier to see on the street.

The bad things are, broadly speaking, internal engine damage of many

I would certainly consider a Ferrari F1 car a sports car.  I had the
pleasure of driving a C2 with a Tip and it was an absolute blast. The wider
gearing of the 4 speed automatic puts the 993 tiptronic a nearly 1 sec.
disadvantage in 0-60mph versus the 6 speed.  But the real world advantage
in being able to preselect your exit gear should make you a bit faster.
There is also something to be said for moving the lever to D when in a

Ralph,

Actually, Henry Watts is the LPR Autocross Chairman.  I had to step
down due to an extreme change in the amount of free time available
to conduct LPR Autocross business.

Henry is the best damned autocross instructor I have ever seen.  He
has invested a lot of time teaching me how to drive and is the major
reason I am as capable as I am. I actually think that he does not mind
me beating him once in a while.

On top of all this, he is a great person to be around.  If you ever have
a chance to ride with him or have him ride with you, TAKE IT!!!

	The pilot of this particular 757 gets a F for pre-flight planning, and a
A for in-flight emergency procedures.  He is/was an active glider pilot, and
"just did a normal glider landing".  In a modern jetliner, that has a Lift/Drag

that had people using it for picnics, autocrosses, etc, etc.  Amazing.

That's funny, I just had 4 flights last week on a 767, 737, Airbus 320, 
and something else.  The Airbus had a really hacked-looking multi-panel 
riveted cover over the engine hanger pod (sorry for improper 
terminology) and some poor fitting slats (paint scraped off main wing 
in spots), but the Recaro seats and interior noise level & panel design 
were pretty good compared to _older_ 7xx's.

The 767 was by far my favorite, as they've drastically cut one of the 
subjectively loudest sounds - the HVAC system.  Lighted seat controls 
and really cool avionics were appreciated too.  Most interestingly, the 
plane's response to turbulence feels a lot better to the seat of my 
pants, as the normal vertical (tension inducing) motions seemed to be 
converted to lateral wiggling, something I can tolerate much better.

All this is completely subjective of course.  I love flying but hate 
being out of control and not knowing what's going on (OK, OK - I admit 
it - I need to be in the cockpit sliding that baby around, just as I do 
in my 951 on the ground!).

Hello all P-philers!

My '71 914 is running better every day and has become a little more
reliable now, though I still have a lot of work left to do.  I am posting
this because I think it is time for me to sell my other car, a 1993 RX-7
(the new body style).  I am getting married in May and two little red
2-seat cars just won't work for me any more.  I'm selling the RX-7 to get
something a little bigger, I've got my eye on one of the new Chevy
Blazers/Jimmys.  But, today I came up with another idea,  I saw an 81 911
Targa for sale, and started thinking, well, that's a little bigger than the
RX-7.... Anyway, I'm having a hard time talking my fiancee into it.  I'll
keep working on her.  

Well to get to the point now, just thought I'd give the list a crack at it
first:

If you're interested send me a personal e-mail and I'll let you know

doesn't care.  The car is located in Morgatown, WV.

I have a 1988 944T with the following modifications : level ride height.
 bilstein shocks. strut brace. autothority stage 2 chips with the banjo nut
for extra boost. replaced air box with k & n cone filter. dumped the cat.
converter. 5'' supertrapp stainless exhaust and a modified MFS. 

I have noticed quite a bit of white smoke lately under full thottle
acceleration. Also,  my Bosch platinums seem to have a dry, sootie, black (
carbon? ) residue on the lower one or two threads and the base of the plug.
There is none on the electrode or ceramic tower, they seem to be burning
properly. All of this started after I decreased the tension on the ' barn
door ' in the MFS. I loosened the spring about 8 clicks and noticed that when
I pushed and then released the accel. pedal the RPMs dropped to a very
unconfortable level before the idle stabilizer brought them back to normal.
So I backed off to 3 clicks and curred the problem.

My question is this.  Is it possible that the black plug buildup is occurring
while idleing and that my "quickness" under instant accelleration has indeed
increased with no potentially harmful side effects ?  I know I am creating A
slightly richer mixture by fooling the mfs into thinking that more air is
flowing initially therfore send more fuel.  

Also what do you think about the supertrapp ? It sure sounds good but do you
think I am giving up HP ? Especially low-end. I have tried to use enough
diffusers to increase backpressure from the open exhaust mode.  

Any help or coments is appreciated ( with the exception of my spelling ).

This is a question for all the Airheads, Geeks, and people with too much
free time:

A friend and I were having this discussion the other day,  a car is shaped
similar to the wing of an airplane.  I suppose a 944 would be the closest
P-model.  The question then is, how fast would one have to drive to
overcome the weight and drag to become airborn?  We may have to assume that
the front spoiler has been removed and the underside of the car is smooth,
to allow clean airflow, but is this possible to calculate?

I suppose a 928 in Reverse may be a more ideal airfoil, but I don't think
that we could find the cd for a car in reverse.

If this can be calculated, does anyone have enough free time to calculate
it for the different models and post them in order of lift off speed?

Hey Nate,
Could  you shoot another onw to the list for me.

All this talk of british cars has made me wish to share something. I have
been doing an internship (work for free) at a restoration place that
specializes in Brit metal. I get to learn to paint weld wet sand wire
rebuild . . . on other peoples cars before I do it to mine. First I think
the work for free thing is going to save me a ton of money ince my auto
habits lean towards the classics. Two its been wonderful working Healeys
and MGs. I swear the MGA might just be the prettiest car I have ever seen.
This was when it was parked next to an E-type both of them finished. If
Asked to choose I might just have picked the A.

Second thing I have learned about brit cars is They go together hard, but
come apart easy. It takes days to wire the damn things so blinkers work but
only minutes for them to fail. The P-car 914 by comparison seems to come
apart slow and go togther fairly easily.

the problem is not so much lift, as ground effects. a car on the ground has
very different aerodynamics than a car that is already airborne due to the
behavior of air under the car. the real serious F1 teams use rolling road
wind tunnels. as an example, I heard of a pantera that crested a hill at
135mph, and got airborne. made that pesky transition from car to wing. even
those Nascar bricks tended to "loft" before they got air brakes.

Okay, but then if it's $240 for coolant, then you need no lubricant. Now, 
where do you get this 4 times a year bit? As I recall, synthetic (Mobil 1 
or whatever you prefer) needs changing only twice if even that each year. 
And while we go at new math, Mobil 1 is only $3.50/qt. (here anyways). 
So, for synthetics, the new cost is:
12*2*3.50=$84
If you decide to go with dino juice (which should be changed 4 times a year):
12*4*.90=$43.2

> 3. Anti-freeze is $ 6.00 per gallon.  Flush once a year and you have blown

Okay, I'll stick with the $6/gal. Now, you are supposed to change twice 
though, so now you're at $24.

3a. Oil for my water box is the same price as for a Porsche (but the 
water box only needs 5 qts per change)
Synthetics:
5*2*3.5=$35
5*4*.90=$18

So to recap all the math here:

AntiFrz        $0				    $24
DinoJc	       $43.20				    $18

Hm. $1.20 more for the Porsche... not a bad deal...

Subject: RE: RE:944S stalling out


Hi  Chris,

The simplest way to take the O2 sensor out of play is to unplug it.  There
is a three-connector plug for it at the back of the fuel rail, underneath 
the
black plastic fuel rail cover and in a white plastic clip.  The DME realizes
that it is unplugged (in fact, simply not electrically available), and runs
"open loop."

Which brings us to your second question.  A system runs "closed loop"
when its output is sampled (fed back) and used to affect the transfer
function.  In the case of a DME, the O2 sensor is used to fine tune the
amount of fuel injected per cycle.  It runs "open loop" when the feedback
path is disabled, ie, opened.

Regarding "lights off," both the catalytic converter and the O2 sensor
work properly only when at operating temperature.  This is why the O2
sensor is ignored by the DME for the first few minutes of operation.  (I
forget exaclt how long.  Depends in part on whether it is an early, single-
wire unit vs. a later three-wire unit.  The later ones have an electric 
heater,
which is the reason for the extra two wires.)

I don't think there's anything wrong with your temperature sensors.  They
rarely go bad.  When I say "temperature related," what I mean is
something which is for some reason affected  by engine temperature.
Warming up the engine can in some cases open up a vacuumleak, in
other cases close it up.  Depends on the faulty piece.

Happy hunting.

No, you've been given the wrong part.  the .05 is for cars up to MY85, and
is as you observe shorter.  You want the .07 part (944.106.237.07), which
is appropriate for MY85.5 and later non-turbo 944's.

I don't know about the .02 version.  If that was what was stamped on the

Subject: Re: Wanted: 944 S2 Cab

Last year I bought a 944S2 coupe in Houston.  I went to both dealerships and
searched the paper and Sports Car Trader for about a year before I found the
right one.  

I found mine in the Chronicle Classifieds and the desription seemed to good
to be true.  I took a day off of work, saw the car and brought it to Don
McGill Porsche to have it checked out.  Best 50 bucks you'll ever spend.
 They caught everything like the front and back bumper had been repainted
(wreck?).  I even checked the service records because the car had been
serviced there.

I paid $13,800 for a 1989 S2 with 69,000 miles on it.  No oil leaks, motor
mounts is good shape, new clutch, just had the 60,000 mile ($$$) scheduled
maintenance.  I thought it was a steal.  Convertibles run $10,000 more than
the coupes new but I suspect you could get one for about $5,000 more than a
used coupe.

Give Gerry Reel a call at Don McGill (713-493-1000).  He works the used lot
there.  Tell him what you're looking for and he will call you periodically to
let you know if he has found something.  He aslo lets you test drive anything
on the lot.

Good luck.

Menelaos,

The Autocross version, the BFG R1 226 compound, is no longer available.
The 230 compound is a very nice tire that is better (faster) than any
version of the Yokohama RS tire. I used the Yokohama RS II (autocross
compound) tire last year and switched to the BFG R1 230 compound this
year. I can already tell that it is a much faster tire. My local

If the car is designed properly you will never get airborne !

Cars may in fact have an airfoil shape, but unlike an airplane wing
where the low pressure side is on top (sucking the airplane into the
sky), on a car the low pressure SHOULD form underneath  sucking the
car to the ground.  The faster the bigger the suck (said the actress
to the bishop :-)).

if it were not this way the faster you drove the more uncontrollable
the car would get since there would be less downforce with all the
various problems associated.

bart can tell you how to get a corvette airborne though !

Richard,

The immediate fatal symptoms are:

(1) The alternator light comes on (same belt as fan)
(2) The temp guage starts climbing at an <unbelievable> rate.
(3) Bad things possible: warped heads, engine seizure, more ...

If you turn off ignition as soon as your brain is able to process the 
information you probably will save the day. Be careful as you coast out of 
traffic and pull over safely.

I'm not sure of newer 911's lock the steering wheel with the ignition off so 
you might want to check that first.

The experience:

Being an electronics geek I had designed an 'exclusive or' circuit (XOR) 
that drives a piezoelectric buzzer between the oil light and alternator 
light. That geekness saved me that day. (I might not have noticed the 
'idiot' light soon enough!)

For non techies an XOR circuit can be designed with just a few diodes so 
that if either light (but NOT both; so that when you turn the ignition on 
the warning does'nt sound) shines you'll be alerted. Costs just a few $$ 
with Radio Shack parts, and easy to install too.

If you check on the belt regularly though this should not be such a concern.

there was a wwII airman who recently gave a talk at the airmans club I

he kept saying things like "there were fokkers all over us" and "that

some of the ladies present were visably disturbed everytime he mentioned

Well.  I don't know where to find it, but there are some very important
quantities called Cx, Cy, Cz (may be the names are different in US) that
describe the car in aerodynamic terms.  Usually, only Cx is given.
It's around 0.30 .
(axis x is the horizontal one, y is lateral and z is vertical)

For instance, the Cx quantity allows you to compute the aerodynamic force
in the horizontal direction.

Fx = 0.5 x Sx x Cx x U^2 x p

where U is the car's speed in meters per seconds,
p is the density of air in kg per m^3 (around 1.3),
Sx is the suface exposed to the air in m^2 (try to imagine the
shadow of your car if you stands just in front of it, it's the surface
the wind will `see').

The force is in newtons (N).

You drive at 130 km/h (36 m/s), with a Cx=0.30, and a Sx=1.5 m^2:
Fx = 0.5 x 1.5 x 0.30 x 36^2 x 1.3 = 380 N

The aerodynamic power is P = Fx x U = 13650 W = 20 hp
(remember it's at a constant speed and there are some other power
losses like tires.  In fact, you need more power to run at 130 km/h)

>I suppose a 928 in Reverse may be a more ideal airfoil, but I don't think
>that we could find the cd for a car in reverse.

After the rear tiny wheels, here comes the reversed race flying car :-))

>If this can be calculated, does anyone have enough free time to calculate
>it for the different models and post them in order of lift off speed?

Back to the problem of changing a 928 to an airplane.

Yes, you're right.  Some cars used to have a negative Cz.  It simply means
that their road holding decreased if the speed was getting higher.

That doesn't happens if the car is well designed (like a P' one).  I'm
told that the duck tail increased the weight of 40 kilos more at 130 km/h
(take it as a typical value, not a factory one).

If you want to transform your car in a plane, you will have to measure what is
Sz x Cz.  If Sz x Cz is negative, it'll mean that the more the speend grows, the
less the car will weight.

The is the car mass is M (in kilos), it weights g x M newtons.

The speed to reach will be as

Fz = 0.5 x SCz x U^2 x p = g x M

so U = sqrt ( (g x M x 2) / (SCz x p) ).

But it's not easy to measured the SzCz quantity and very hard to computed
(excepted you have very precised plans and the right program to do it).

May be the best to do is to ask directly PCNA or the factory to obtain
those figures.


That's all for today, you can leave school.  Thanks for coming.

Pierre F-F.


NB : I don't want to start an aerodynamic flame war, but I'm not
     sure that Fz depends of Sz.  But it doesn't matter as you'll measure
     the product SzCz when you test a car.

Subject: Rear *#$%@& Panel

Hey all,
Thanks for the help in getting that rear interior panel out. So, now that the
panel is out and the mounting screw hole is accessable, does anyone know the 
direction that the seat belt reel registration pin goes. It looks like I will
have to *drill* a hole for the registration pin. I want to be sure of the angle before I make the mistake, Oh I mean, hole! It appears that I should just aim 
the output of the reel toward the hanger on the upper post. Any suggestions or
Flames would be accepted.
TIA again

But not 4V Porsches. No room for the valve gear and the fins. One or the
other, not both. 4V Porsche heads have until now required water cooling.
Yes, I know, there's an aftermarket maker of air cooled 4V heads. I'm not a

aftermarket can.

The address IS http://tta.com/PCA/Carolinas/homepage.html  I just got the

Steve,
	Actually, I have one of each (flusher and airhead), and I like 
the 911 best. But it has nothing at all to do with air cooling vs water 
cooling. Seems silly to make a decision on what car to buy based solely 
on what type of engine it has (air cooled or not), the end result is 
what is important (otherwise, I would buy a Mazda RX7 with the GREAT 
rotary engine. Uh, oh, any RX7 owners out there, do not send flames. I 
have owned several over the years and like them a lot, too!).

My worst so far was when i was switching on the light in my 924 (the

Keith,
	I drove both when I was looking at the C2's back in '91 and was 
not impressed. This is a ver personal preference type of thing, though, 
and I would highly recommend getting your dealer to let you drive both 
for more than a spin around the block. BTW, I love my 993 Cab (with 6 
speed). You will probably rarely use 6th in the USA, but it is a great 
gearbox and very enjoyable. The only way I would consider the Tiptronic 
is if you are driving a lot of miles every day in heavy traffic. In that 
case, sports car or not, I prefer an automatic. Lucky I don't live in LA 
:-).

Well Larry... You obviously try very hard every day to find a way to make
yourself feel better by putting others down. Generally when this is the case
the person providing all the rationalization is really uncomfortable with
the situation they are in. I think you should spend your energy on more
rewarding things, since none of the 911 owners think two-bits about your
rationale.  As far as the cost to 'flush' our cooling systems, we don't
care!!!! If we couldn't afford our cars we would sell them. We simply have
decided that we very much like all of the characteristics of our 911's, that
is why we bought them. That is why people STILL buy them today!!!!

When sideways, stay on the gas and deal with it. (my motto)

I would have to agree - that would be a great sight. It would 
also scare the s**t out of me, as Rob Yasek can attest first
hand, large aircraft in formation create incredible vortices
that can lead to a quick thinning of the species. We lost some
B-52s early in the 'Nam goat-rope just because of that. They
then developed the trail formation that got away from the

Well, they're not -that- common. It's primarilly an Itallian thing, the
germans (BMW) have finally joined the 4-valve air-cooled crowd. Although
there are some american made engines that fit the bill, but they're more 
custom racing built engines and are not easilly available to the public.

for the part (new OEM).  I previously asked if it truly is a VW part and the
word isn't in on that note.

OKLAHOMO FOREIGN has "guaranteed" (?) used ones for $150.  I am reluctant to
go with used but for that price difference I could do 6 used ones for the
price of one dealer new!  Has anyone delt with Oklahoma Foreign.

>>(We'll see if this generates any flames.)

Afterburner on full blast for this one, As mentioned in a few
postings, F1 racing has had semi-auto boxes since 1990 [Ferrari].
Since its introduction practically all teams have switched, due to
the performance advantages.

The only reason I believe that the current tiptronic S 993 is
approx 1 sec slower in the 0-60 time vs the 6-speed is that the
tiptronic has only four gears which don't have suitable ratios for
producing a faster 0-60 time.

Personally I can't wait for a 6-speed tiptronic S [selector on the
wheel] based transmission.  Under braking and acceleration at
Track and AutoX events, I'm sure that a 6-speed tiptronic will be
smoother and quicker than a manual.

Tiptronic S is just the type of high-tech improvement I expect
from Porsche to keep them ahead of the competition and at the
leading (bleeding edge).

>>Craig Z.
>>If anyone can, Porsche will redefine "sports car".

I for one fully agree.

I would like to hear comments from any philes who have driven
(raced) a 911/968/993 tiptronic at a track or AutoX event.

Here's a quote from a recent article on the New 1995 Jordon
Formula 1 car:

"As far as the transmission is concerned, the 195 features a new 7
speed longitudinal gearbox. With the torque reduction in the
engines - which are 3 litre units this year - this enables us to
use a narrower rev band. That in turn enables Peugeot to increase
power at the peak end of the range. Another factor which
influenced our decision to go for a 7 speed box is the use of the
hydroelectronic [semi-auto] gearchange. It's so fast that you
really don't pay a penalty any more by having 7 gears.  It
currently takes about 25 milliseconds to change gear - that
equates to about 0.15 seconds to go from 1st to 7th. That's faster
than we used to be able to change one gear in 1991 when the boxes
were operated manually!"

You betcha! It's been run officially... Seven (?) times, I think. It's always run by 
Brock Yates, Car & Driver columnist and all-around nutty guy. He wrote the 
screenplay before the movie before it was hacked into a stupid psuedo-car movie 
that glorified drinking and driving and general idiocy. (Hint: Run, don't walk, to 
your video store and rent The Gumball Rally. Terrific movie, predated the 
Cannonball Run movie, and is a real ball - especially near the end, with a 
Daytona Spyder and a 427 Cobra racing side-by-side in the aquaducts of Los 
Angeles... And to the best of my knowledge, all the cars were REAL cars.

The first one that includes several competitors was won by Brock and Dan 
Gurney in a Ferrari Daytona coupe. I recommend picking up Brock's book, 
Sunday Driver, and giving it a read - the last section involves the Cannonball.

Brock's a neat guy - I've ALMOST met him several times, and have been down to 
his bar, The Cannonball Pub, in sleepy Wyoming, New York. (A real one-horse 
town, except for his bar, with the big Ferrari sign out front, and tons of auto 
goodies all over the inside of the place.)

Anyways, I'd be willing to bet that it's been run unofficially quite a number of 
times. It's just too appealing an idea to sit for so long without having been done.

Subject: 944 Overheating

I have an early '83 944 with 145k miles and have probably had most of the
possible problems with the cooling system (and most of the other systems).  The
temperature gage should normally read at around the 3/4 mark after the car is
warmed up, and hardly ever vary from whatever spot your car thinks is normal.
You may reach the edge of the "Yellow Zone" under extreme conditions such as
prolonged idling with the A/C on in 90+ weather, or driving up mountain roads
with a luggage rack and two bikes on top and the A/C on.

You should check that both electric fans are running when the temperature switch
turns them on.  If one fan fails you will never notice it unless you check them
by letting the car idle until you reach the turn on point.  They normally don't
run at all if the car is moving unless the A/C is on.  I have seen a used car
for sale with only one fan working which overheated during the test drive.

There is one relay which controls the fans during normal conditions and a
separate one which turns them on whenever the A/C is switched on.  Either of
these relays can keep the fans off. If your A/C will not work at all this relay
is a likely culprit.

The fan switch in the radiator can fail either open or shut.  If the fans won't
run under normal hot idling conditions but switch on when you turn on the A/C
this switch is not closing (or the wire is broken). If the fans start as soon as
you start the car (A/C not on) the fan switch is stuck shut.  This also leads to
the deadest battery you have ever seen, because one fan will continue to run in
the "cool down" mode even after the key is removed.

If your car overheats but the radiator remains cold (the fans may or may not
run) your thermostat is stuck shut or the radiator is blocked.  The thermostat
bypasses water around the radiator until the engine is hot, so the hot water may
never get to the fan switch, but you will see a normal reading on the gage.

I made the mistake of putting stop leak in my car once to correct a small leak.
Within 2 miles it had turned into a gusher, as the top tank separated from the
core.

The water pump usually goes by leaking or bearing failure, rarely by loss of
pumping action.  The pump is the cheap part, the shop labor to replace it is
about 6 hours (it took me 12 in my own garage) the special belt tool p9201 is
required, as all of the belts have to come off.

Hope some of this helps, Clint Owen

Yes, this is what happens.  You have adjusted the springing of
the barn door, which affects it both on accel and on decel.  The system
is damped by both the spring and by a pocket of air behind the other leg
of the right-angled barn door.  Bosch set the spring to the right tension;
you changed it.

I guess it depends on the car.  I have personally seen a VW bug skip 
across hard-packed sand at 100 miles per hour or so like a rock skipping 
over water.  Distance between the take-off and landing points (judging 
from the tracks left in the sand) was about 25 feet.

Of course, cars don't have to be wing-shaped to get airborne.  Even 
high-downforce race cars will fly (once) if they crest a hill at speed 
and get a little air underneath.

I can't give all the exact numbers, but I had the opportuninty to get some
interesting anecdotes from an Indy car driver and owner.
He was in the process of selling his '73 914, a formula ford with 4 wheel
sets and spare engine, -and- his indy car (with full spares of everything
of course). It turns out that the car he was selling (one he competed in
for a number of years) was big-Als car in 1982. His comments were
interesting to say the least. First off, he said driving the car was SCARY.
And he gave a great explanation as to why Indy cars fly off the track so
fast if they get sideways. He described his car as such: The car has 1000lb
coil springs in order to counteract the 1800lbs of downforce that the car
generates at speed (-think about it-). Now if the car gets sideways, the
downforce INSTANTLY disapears, and that 1000lbs will literally launch the
car into the air, not far but far enough to loose all traction, and the
rest is simple newtonian mechanics. He said that had happened to him once
where it happened so fast that he didn't even know what happened, he just
saw flying hay bails all of a sudden. Yikes!

I didn't get to drive it, but I did get to sit in it.

	I don't think this is correct.  My chemistry is a bit hazy, but I 
don't think that current antifreeze has much effect on the specific heat 
capacity of the coolant.  However, it significantly raises the boiling point.

	In the owner's manual for my '62 Cadillac, it says to use 
antifreeze in the winter and water in the summer.  For anything newer, 
the manual says to keep antifreeze/coolant year-round.  My guess is 
there's been a big change in antifreeze between 1962 and 1977+.

Just received a Technical Bulletin straight from Porsche. 
Once again they have an updated engine mount for all 944 series cars. They
include 924S, 944/S/S2/T. all years. 
The new mount # 951 375 042 04, supersedes the former version, 951 375 042
05. In a startling reversal it is no longer a hydraulic unit, but is spring
loaded. It is longer than the old mount thereby eliminating the 4mm spacer
used in the old model (on the right side). 
This mount is applicable to either side of the engine. They are also saying
that you can mix and match so you need not replace both mounts at the same
time. They are also a bit pricey although I don't have the exact numbers. I
do know that they are more expensive than the supersceeded part.(surprize)
BTW you don't have to have a vibration problem to need a new mount. The
factory would have you replace mounts if the engine oil pan drops below the
lowest point of the front crossmember. Something about not tearing out your
oil pan if you encounter an obstacle.

Porsche is playing with a similar system (EKS), already available in some
of the RUF tuner cars. An article by Bruce Anderson in a recent issue of
Excellence extols the virtues of this unit. EKS is distinct from  the Tipo
in being an electronically shifted traditional gearbox (hydroelectronic
[semi-auto] gearchange) as opposed to the torque converter-type slushbox we
all are familiar with.

Once you can shift *right now* by wire it's a short trip from the stick to
a button on the steering wheel.

stuff came Friday. The p&c are installed. I also bought new tensioners.
From what I can tell and have read there are 3 varieties of mechanical
tensioners (not including the oil fed). What they sent me was part
#930.105.053.00 (turbo's?). From what I understand these tensioners are
smaller and hence, I also got spacers. To be on the "safe" side I bought
the clips that fit above them in case they fail. I assume that installing
the saftey clips is a good idea, comments? Today I will be removing the
rocker arms from the cam housings and (hopefully!) mounting those. I do
have to comment that there is nothing tooo overwhelming in this job as
long as one takes one thing at a time (an has the *BEST* tech suport
known to man..Porschephiles ;-) and handles the logistics of the outside
work.                                              

   Looking ahead to a compleation date of April 1st, I did notice a few
items that need to be attend to. The oil tank and associated lines will
be cleaned,I am going to rebuild the Webbers (or at least the excelerator
pumps), and I was looking at the trans mounts. Most of the trans mounts
I have seen are the same type as the motor mounts. On this '66 they are not.
I haven't looked into availability yet but, it looks as if they are pressed
in. Anyone familiar with these? Are they still available?

Trond says
>The little village of Carrera is placed in the Alps, I don't know if
>Switzerland or Germany or Austria
 
Carrera is in Graubuenden (or Grisons), Switzerland. It has about 2 people
and 200 cows. I think everybody who buys a Carrera notices this little dot
on the big map of Switzerland (won't appear on small maps) and decides to go
there to photograph car in front of city (sort of) limits sign. (If anybody
is looking for it, it's on the Swiss road 67, between Bonaduz and Ilanz, on
the south side of the upper Rhine valley (the Rhine is only a creek at this
point), a few miles south of the bigger town of Flims which is on the other
side of the Rhine and which gets more traffic on its wider road. What little
traffic is on the 67 often has to stop while herds of cattle are driven
along -- not across, along -- the road.) So of course I had to go there too.
While doing this, I noticed that the farmer whose farm is
right behind the city limit sign was watching all this, apparently confused.
Now this poor rustic has probably seen dozens of Porsches stop in front of
his barn, people get out, take pictures of car and his barn, and drive off
without explanation. I felt it was time for one. I called out to him that my
car is a Carrera, just like his town. "Oh........ Ja." And looking past
him, over his shoulder, what is peeking out of his barn? The nose end of a
Porsche tractor. I said "I see you are a Porsche driver too." There was a
moment of silence, THE FARMER TURNED AROUND, LOOKED AT THE TRACTOR, TURNED
BACK, and said "Oh.......Ja."
 
True story.
 
I think the remote village of Carrera suffers from excessive inbreeding, or
lack of television, or both.

Heck, I'll go one further than that - not even station wagons should have

I enjoy driving... And the whole point of driving sports cars is to get closer 
to the driving experience, not to be removed from it, as with luxury cars. 
(It goes without saying that I hate everything that luxury cars stand for.)

I've promised myself that I'll never own a car with an automatic. The

Hello folks, I request help in locating prior owners of my 85 Targa Carrera.
I bought this car in DC this summer. I have complete history from the guy I
bought it from and the owner prior. There the trail stops. The second prior
owner was a Lt. in the army, did a lot of work on his own. His name is John
T. Dluzak. The last address I had on him was in DC; but he moved around quite
a bit. Parts invoices indicate in Hale's Corners, Wi, Huntsville, Al,
Romulus, ny, and Ft. Drum, NY. I'd really appreciate either a line on him or
advice on how to trace owners prior to him. My receipts from his ownership
only go back to 5/20/91 and I'm interested in any added history I can get my
hands on.

Thanks in advance

Actually this is true.  Antifreeze conducts heat more slowly than 
water.  It raises the boiling point but doesn't get the heat out of the 
block/head as fast as pure water.

Suggested best solution is to slightly reduce the antifreeze 
concentration during summer.

If this is on a 951 as the email header indicates, another possibility 
is turbo center bearing failure.  This would produce white (oil) smoke 
in the exhaust and might, depending on the leak, get into the intake 
tract and coat your spark plugs especially on their cool parts.

Pull the ducting between the turbo outlet and the intercooler and check 
it for oil.  If it's nicely coated inside, you have a good bit of evidence.

Subject: Re: Airplanes.....(forever)

Bart:

Shame on you for passing on "second-hand" war stories to these
kids....(Trond, Ben, Martin, Hugh, etc, etc, etc, following Pete's posting
and spirited defense).

..The "f****er* on my tail was a Messerschmitt!" was a popular WWII joke.
 Same vintage as "Yanks....oversexed and over here".

..Fokker was and still is a Dutch Company with WWI designs like the D-VII.

..Hurricanes (not Spitfires) were the primary contributor to the Battle of
Britain.  Spits not available in quantities.  Although Hurricane was not a
"great" fighter aircraft, the heroics of RAF pilots and short fuel duration
of German fighters over target helped.

..B-17s dropped over 80 percent  of the tonnage on occupied Europe and
Germany from English-based bomber aircraft.  Also took over 85 percent of
bomber/crew losses.  Lancasters, Sterlings, etc never got the night fighter
attention commensurate with daytime "precision" bombing raids.

..North American P-51 originally designed for British..US Army Air Corps tried
 in ground attack role as A-36.  Never a great air combat aircraft until the
later versions replaced the RR Merlins with Allisons.

..Both US and allies and Russians recruited German Scientists.  US Contingent
worked at White Sand Missile Range before later move to Huntsville (Werner in
fact was the first to coin the term to girls in Juarez..."But I am a Rocket
Scientist").  Chrysler, out of gratitude, made his brother Magnus Chief of
Quality Control in the 60's and he was able to accelerate deterioration of
 their already abysmal quality.

..God Bless the Marines and their combat spirit..when it comes to business,
however, the Army and AF periodically try to save them from themselves and
the Navy.  They had "egg on face" at the original US flight demo of the
Harrier AV8-A which  had to be "scrubbed" when they didn't have the UK spec
"rather than MIL or NATO" fuel and lubricants to impress the invited crowd.
(BTW Soviet aircraft were designed to use MIL and NATO fuel and lubes)


..Finally (to get on a Porsche thread), Porsche DID NOT design the production
version of the WWII Tiger tank.  They built two prototypes and lost the
production contract to Henschel.  As I've mentioned before, Porsche has a
history of difficulty in translating innovative and advanced designs into
volume production.  (and yes, the Porsche design did become the Jagdpanzer
"Ferdinand"  Tank Destroyer,  encumbered by poor battlefield reliabilty).

Enough said..

BTW, Pete, I don't mind 2-hour or less trips in the Airbus...very quiet and
relatively comfortable except for the cabin compartment doors which swing

Subject: Re: Air cooled motors: why ?

You neglected to mention emissions restrictions.  Since the operating
temperature is more erratic with air cooled engines it is harder to tune the
engine for peak power and emissions, although this fact is being made less
relevant with the more advanced electronic engine management systems that
have been developed.

By the way, as any 911 driver such as myself knows, some of the air cooled
cars out there are also really oil cooled. Hence the 12 quart 911 oil change
and long piping runs to the fender mounted cooler or loop.  Suzuki actually
advertised their original GSX motorcycles as air/oil cooled since they added
an second oil pump that operated at higher pressures to direct greater
volumes of cooling oil to the undersides of the pistons in these motorcycles.

Hello Proschephiles:

I just purchased some EXCELLENT quality parts while hunting for pieces for my 71
911T.  These parts were on a stock 70 911T that was used for club events.  This
car was perfect!  Absolutely no rust!!  He lost the 2.2 and decided to bump it
up to a heavily modified 2.7.  In doing so he also decided to build a race car.
So... on went the fiberglass and out came the interior and many great stock
metal parts.  Sorry, I got the front fenders but heres a list of some of the
things that I wont be needing from that car.

Front Hood - $200
Deck Lid - $150
RS Front w/Brake Ducts - $75
Side Glass - $30
Window Mechanisms - $25
Glove Box Door - $25
More, more, more...
Buyer Pays Shipping.

After my last post (Early 911 Parts), I received many responses.  This has made
me realize that I need to get a little more organized.  Ill be putting an
accurate list together with tag numbers, descriptions and prices.  As soon as
its together Ill repost and send it to all interested.  Ive now gathered lots
of parts and I want to move them... I dont want to be Mr. Parts Collector (my
wife doesnt like it much either).  So, by all means dont wait around for the
list.  If you have an early 911 (66-70) drop me a post.  I may have what you
need.

Maybe you can help me:

I need a dash (who doesnt) for my 71 T.  I would like it with the speaker cover
as well. Im looking for a good used piece.  Are there any out there?  I would
also like some door panels, pockets and various door accessories.

Subject: Re: Steward at Sebring

I like to see this subject drop soon, but Mr. Kitchak completely mis-stated the
nature of the problem Pat was addressing. The incidents that occurred at this event
were alot more serious then some car driver telling a corner worker that they did not 
do their job right (which no driver should do anyway unless they are willing to go out
on the corners work a few weekends themself).
 
It was more on the lines of a driver who was refusing to follow our safety
requirements and then deciding it was time to threaten the steward physically and 
verbally throw about every four letter word at him. This was not the only time this 
has happen at an event. I been at events were "the finger" has been given to a 
Chief Steward, to corner workers and to other drivers. Only a very, very, small
percent of the drivers have been a problem, but it has been growing a bit so the
threat to put them on the trailer is need before it gets out of hand.

If Mr. Kitchak feels that PCA Club Racing is a bit too "officious"
then so be it, nobody is forced to attend these events, but judging
by the growth in the number of drivers and events in the last two years I 
think that this feeling is not widely held. I think that most of the drivers 
like the ideal that we have a 13/13 rule and that it is enforced so that
the crash-n-burn type drivers are discouraged from attending/continuing these races. 
PCA Club racing was started to allow the Porsche owner who had no racing experience 
a chance to take his P-car out and race it in a some what controlled environment 
(sort of an oxymoron but we try). If after a while they want more challenges or 
competition then there are other venues to try out and I think we will see this
year some PCAers that started racing in Club Racing doing very well in IMSA. 

Yes I like to see alot more lightening up going on in PCA Club Racing but I think a there
a few more drivers that need to then stewards.

They claim that braking systems could reach the point of requiring a      
double-wide pedal that would be applied with both feet.

Balancing tires ON the car would allow out-of-balance components like 
brake discs, hubs, etc. to be compensated for, but since those pieces 
are usually well-balanced already, you should get good results even if 
the tires are balanced off the car.

Just make sure that the guy doing the balancing is running the machine 
at the "high" speed, and ask him to put the weights on the front AND 
back of the wheel.

In my part of the world, the number of shops that'll even do on-the-car

Porsche used (at least during the early '70's) a sticky, putty-like compound

 It usually was a seal at the base of a speed not fastener. It was usually

Does anyone know what this stuff was, and where it is available?  The

I believe I've read several times that having adequate antifreeze in
your engine coolant is critical even in summer, because of all of
the corrosion-inhibitors.  And that this is even more important
for aluminum and aluminum-alloy blocks/heads/etc.  If this is not
true, I'd sure like to know (and why).

As far as the overheating, unless this is a common problem with
your model of car, I would say that running on straight water

Yes, the 1985/2-1991 seats from 944s will fit (with a couple of minor
modifications) in your 84 944.  Some of those seats came with heat as an
additional cost option.  All of the North America cars came with power
cables to both of the seats, so you will need the cables also.

The alterations to the 86 seats are minimal:

1) You will have to remove the seat belt receptacle from the new style seat.
You should continue to use the seat belt receptacle mounted on your
transmission tunnel, inasmuch as it will provide more strength.

2) Whereas the 85/2-91 seats are mounted in the 85/2 -91 cars with six
mounting bolts, you will only use the forward 4 points in your 84 (that's
because you only have four mounting points...) That's also why you should
not use the seat mounted seatbelt receptacle...

I would suggest that you use ignition switched power to power the heated
seats, otherwise you might end up with a dead battery because you forgot to
turn off the heat...

BTW, they work great in my 83...

No experience with the kind of cold you will experience, but a block heater
would help.  There are some that bolt to the outside of the oil pan, also
some that heat the coolant and circulate it.  That would help heat the oil
through the oil-coolant intercooler. 
Either type might help.

I have dismantled several 944 engines with more than 200,000 miles (that's
300,000 km in metric) motors that show no cylinder wall wear at all.  In my
opinion, with frequent oil and filter changes, you might be able to get
500,000 miles out of one of these engines, before you have to tear down the
bottom end...

The real proof is going head to head at an autocross or track event. An
automatic 944 will never have a chance against an equivalent manual trans
944.  You just lose too much power due to the inefficiencies of the auto...

When your 944 started as a bare chassis, Dr. Porsche had no idea what kind
of 944 it was going to end up as (i.e. whether automatic or standard...)
So, all that you need to make your car a manual trans 944 is the following:

1) Manual transmission
2) Manual transmission torque tube
3) Manual transmission bell housing
4) Manual transmission flywheel
5) clutch (pressure plate, clutch, throwout bearing, pilot bearing)
6) Clutch slave cylinder and hoses
7) Clutch master cylinder
8) Clutch pedal assembly and mounting hardware
9) Shifter assembly, shift knob and linkage
10) Connections to backup lights.

The good news is, the CV joints and halfshafts are the same.

The bad news is, you will pay $3000 to $4000 US to make this conversion. In
our neck of the woods, that is almost more than what your car is worth
(assuming average mileage of 70,000 to 80,000 miles)...

On the other hand, the likely failures of your car are:
1) The oil seal between the 90W and the atf goes tits up and mixes the two,
causing lots of damage.
2) the Rubber center damper breaks and leaves you stranded with a dead car.

>Does anyone know if there were ever Heated seats made that would fit my 1984
>944?

Yes, heated seats were a factory option for 944's, though I'm not sure if
they were for all years. No doubt they're not cheap, but you can ask fellow
p-philer George B. (George.Beuselinck@bbs.mhv.net) if he has a pair for
sale. A simpler solution would be to go to Canadian Tire and get the heated
seat covers that plug into a cigarette lighter. They're ugly, and not that
cheap ($40 each?), but, boy, are they nice :)

>Saskatchewan: temp as high as +35C in the summer, low as -45C in the winter>

Yeah, but its a *dry* cold...<grin> here in Ottawa we have a *wet* cold.
Believe me, there *is* a difference. You'll find the AC marginal in the
summer as well, but it doesn't matter :)

>I'd also love to hear of anyone's stories on how 944's stand up (or don't) in
>extreme cold situations.  I just acquired my car, and plan to use it
year-round.

The heater works *very* nicely. Steel rims would be a good plan, together
with a second set of tires... high-performance summer tires just don't grip
that well when it is cold, even with lots of tread.

It would be *really* nice if your car has the optional limited slip
differential, otherwise watch for oversteer. The car is quite good in snow,
compared to something like a BMW, for instance.

Keep the snow clear of the roof/hatch. A snow/ice dam can build up in the
gap between the hatch glass and roof, rendering the hatch un-openable. The
same goes for the headlight raising/lowering mechanism. Expect the "hold the
thing up" struts in the engine compartment and rear hatch to stop "holding
up" in the cold, but start working again in the spring.

The front fenderwells can store an amazing amount of gunk, so make sure to
clean them out regularly during the spring.

I have heard from the local dealer (though I have no proof) that
high-pressure gas shocks such as Bilsteins will blow their seals in very
cold conditions. I do know my front struts are *very* noisy over bumps when
it is cold out.

I don't know if you have power steering, but the power steering system will
complain *very* loudly if you aren't *very* gentle with the steering wheel
in the morning.

>Am now trying to figure out what kind of engine heater I can install --
have had

Well, I just had a quick look at my engine (conveniently located in my
kitchen), and there isn't any obvious place to to put a block heater. You
could probably get by with a battery blanket and synthetic oil (*and*
synthetic gear oil). There isn't really a good location for an in-line
heater-hose heater, but one might be crammed in somewhere. The lower rad
hose doesn't have parallel walls, so a heater spliced in there probably
can't be found, and using the upper hose isn't usually recommended. I don't
like dipstick heaters, and I don't think they can be sold anymore, anyway.
There is a second plug on the oil pan, which may take a heater <shrug>, but
as I recall the type of heater that "sticks on" the oil pan is the one the
local dealer installs.

I'd start with the synthetic oil and a battery blanket and see if that's enough.

An interesting note about 928's that I learned while on a factory tour

Richard, it is extremely important to use antifreeze with corrosion
inhibitors ALL OF THE TIME!  Pure water has no lubricants for the water pump
bearings and seals (an expensive replacement in a 944) and will promote
corrosion of all internal parts.  Additionally, antifreeze mixed with water
has better thermal properties than plain water.  It will provide better
cooling!  I know that for a fact because as a lad I filled the cooling system
in my Triumph GT6 with water, and didn't get very far before the temperature
gauge went into the red.  Refilled with the proper mixture (along with the
required heckling of my father...I told you so!) it once again ran fine.
 Finally, antifreeze will retain it's "anti-freezing" properties
indefinately, but the corrsion and lubrication properties break down rather qu
ickly.  If you don't change it every year or two, you may want to add
corrosion inhibitors.

..............................................................................
.....................

Barry,

 I'm not sure whether anyone else made an attempt at offering you any advice
on this broad question, so I thought I would take a shot. I know your
feelings about buying the 911.  I'm close to being in the same position of
switching from water to air cooled in the garage.

  The price from what you mentioned, (I'll guesstimate the milage at 80,000),
doesn't seem like a steel.  Watching carefully here in the Boston area an SC w
/that mi, in that described condition, would probably be on the market a long
time and fetch maybe $8-11k.  I say that because, even though 911 buyers are
typicly wise and savvy, the market tends to discount cars that have had major
custom work like this one.

  When looking at a car that has been reworked such as this one you can't be
too careful.  Think about:

 -  Who did the work and your relationship w/ them.  Many others won't touch a
911 w/that work, or they'll spend time ($$$) figuring it out.
 -  It's really not a carrera.  It may have the power, but I doubt somebody
would spend all the money to actually replicate one.  Car & Driver in '83
quoted Porsche saying  75-85% of all the engine parts for the carrera had
changed..
 -  It's probably carburated which can be a good reliable conversion if thats
what the mechanic was going for. 
 -  A lot of if's.

  Tie rods are part of a cars steering system.  Turbo tie rod conversions on
911's are popular because most who do it would testify about an improvement
in steering feel and response.  All SC's and, I think, most Carrera's until
the late '80s came without power steering.  This readily increases the
steering feel.  Turbo tie rods make that much of an improvement.

  Sorry to be the bearer of bad tiddings, but the paint and interior work
could easily run in the $1000's, and catalytic converters are'nt cheap
either.  I haven't priced out one for a 911 lately, but look in the mid $100's
 minimum.

  On the track you'll find the 951 clearly fastest with that 911and the S2
dicing it out if your lucky and the mechanic is worth his salt.  Everyone
will tell you the 944 platform is easier to drive then the 911.  This comes
down to weight distribution and a couple other things.  It's about even in
the 944.  The 911 with its engine in back can behave like a pendulum, heavier
rear end swinging out.  The 911's rear tires also want to steer you into a
turn the harder you give them gas and, conversly, out from a turn when you
lift:(.  Its suspension geometry is such that with gas (i.e. rear end squat),
the rear tires toe in more.  Since the weight is on the outside tire, it will
contribute to the direction you are steering in.  Hence, the term "throttle
steer".  I've never done this at the limit of adhesion in a 911, but it
sounds too exciting to pass up.

Wishing you the best,

Subject: Which 911 To Buy (1984-89)

     My price range ($20-30 K) puts me in the 1984-1989 range for 911's as 
     far as I can tell. Aside from the general "which should I buy" 
     question, I pose the following specific questions to the experts:
     
     1. Looking through the 911 FAQ guide, it appears that the Motronic 
     fuel injection system is a good thing. Which years were this 
     available?
     
     2. Also from the FAQ, it appears that US horsepower was below the 
     European tune (217 vs. 231) until 1988. Did hp jump in 1988-9 for US 
     Carreras?
     
     Any general advice or suggested reading would be greatly appreciated.

This is a good one.
On one hand balancing the wheels off the car obviously does not balance the
hub/disk rotating mass.  On the other hand, as far as I know, there is no
good way to perform dynamic balancing (weight imbalance about the tire center
plane, not about its axis) on the car.  From my experience, the tire and rim
imbalance usually far exceeds any hub/disk imbalance, and a good and well
calibrated off-vehicle dynamic balancer is much more sensitive and accurate
than an on-vehicle balancer.
My vote?  Off-vehicle.  Use on-car balancer as a first-order diagnostic.
Warning #1:  Very often, tire balancers in the "mainstream' shops are out of
calibration and/or operators are inept or careless, and it takes patience and
determination to come back or go elsewhere to get it right.  But there are
few things more satisfying than the smoothness from perfectly balanced
wheels...
Warning #2:  Quite often certain aftermarket tires will have roundness or
stiffness non-uniformity substantially outside OE tire specs.  This results
in vibration that cannot be eliminated by any amount or method of balancing.
 In my own experience, Goodyear and Pirelli can be quite bad in this regard,
and the Japanese (Bridgestone, Yokohama) are predictably consistently among
the best, as is Michelin.
Warning #3:  All the above assumes the trivial (and usually easiest to check)
condition that the rims are perfectly straight and round...

Subject: Fan Belt Audio Warning w/ Radio Shack Parts


Well after receiving a few inquiries about the 'XOR' oil/charge warning 
circuit I thought I'd better pull out the plans I drew up back in 1985. The 
good news is I kept records and found two designs. The bad news is I don't 
have Radio Shack part numbers.

The parts list is as follows:

        4 - diodes                       (almost any will work)
        (instead of diodes use a simple low current rectifier!)
        1 - 12V pievoelectric buzzer    (get lowest current model!)

NOTE:   Instead of 4 diodes you should use a 'rectifier' (this is a device 
which has two input connections and two output connections and no matter the 
polarity of the input always gives the same current direction at the output)

Connections are as such:
- ------------------------

(Arrows within brackets [ |<- ] indicate direction of current flow and match 
'diode' symbols. Asterisks '*' indicate connections)


OIL LAMP (+)       >---*--[ |<- ]------*------>>---   (+)
                       |               |                         
   (INPUT)             ---[ ->| ]---   |      (OUPUT)       PIEZO WARNING
                                   |   |                        BUZZER
CHARGE LAMP  (+)   >---*--[ ->| ]--*---|------>>---   (-)
                       |               | 
                       ---[ |<- ]-------

Here's the logic behind the design:

When any lamp is on there is (+) voltage at that connection. The other lamp 
(off) acts as a ground (-) connection (through the light bulb filament). The 
rectifier makes sure that the piezo element gets the proper polarity 
regardless of which lamp is on and which is off.

If both lamps should be lit (ignition on, engine off) then there will be no 
current flow because the rectifier is getting two (+) input voltages with no 
ground (-) to create current flow.

Make sure you use a <LOW CURRENT> (as in small) piezo buzzer ONLY because a 
larger unit will create current flow through the light bulbs. I won't get 
into details about that here.

When you build the unit you will have two wires leading to a black box 
containing the rectifier circuit and piezo buzzer. Installation is simple. 
Connect one wire to of each warning lamp wires. Does not matter which. 

I installed this in my 69-912 back in 1985. The simple circuit has operated 
reliably since then, and saved me once. (too stupid to check fan belt 
regularly?).

The nice thing about the low current piezo element is that it will make a 
faint sound when idling at low RPM when the charge lamp will be dimly lit. 
The system also acts as a 'stall warning' which fellow aviators will 
appreciate!-)

I also designed an transistor driven model (can I have the GOTWA 'Geek of 
the week award') that did not have the low current limitations mention 
above. I never built this unit but have the plans if anyone is interested.

When under my p-car this morning, I noticed some transmission oil leakage 
at the point where the right side CV axle attaches to the transmission
housing. Also, as I moved the axle up and down I could feel more play in
this axle as compared to the left side, and could see the CV joint
separating slightly from the housing.  Not having seen the transmission 
with the axle removed,  I'm guessing that there's a bad seal of some type
inside (or flush with) the transmission housing.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.

	I was surprised to read M.Timmins (sorry i'm not sure about the name)

	My experience with them has been limited (only once last year for a 944

	I took a chance with them without knowing if they were reliable or not;  I

can do a lot of silly things for $100 in saving (after customs, delivery
charges and exchange rate CAN->US $).
	Most of the time I must rely rely on mail-order vendor for my parts need
(since the prices in Montreal area are outrageously high........not enough
competition)
	I would be interested (and maybe some other list-member) to read more about
recommended / avoided mail-order vendor appering in magazine ads
("Excellence" is the only one that I know. Any other???). ....Unless is has
been covered in past months ..... i'm new to this list u-know.

Subject: Re: 944 Rear Hatch


	I'm not sure if someone answered your request , I quickly scanned my unread
mail without finding any reply to rear hatch (maybe I missed it). Wowww... I
think I can answer my first Porschephile message. 

	I have a 85/2 Coupe 944 which had exactly the same problem with the rear
hatch. The top portion of the frame was slowly coming off the glass and while
running
on the highway the whole thing was squeeking and grinding like hell.
	I went to my favorite Porsche dealer which gave me two options :

	1) change the rear hatch ............around $2000  .......nahhh

	2) leave the car there a couple of days in order to rebuild the rear hatch
	    (done by a sub-contractor which come to take the hatch, rebuild it,
	   and the dealer reinstall everything......for around $600 ... sounds great
	   compare to #1 but ...............nahhhh 

	I choose #3 options which is:
	
 I was able to obtain the name of the sub-contractor fixing the rear hatch 
for the Porsche dealer  .......... interesting!!!!!
	
  I told the dealer that I will think about it and I called the day after the
glass shop.

	The shop charge me $120 , "YES".... one hundred and twenty dollars (tax
included) to do the following things:
	1) remove the hatch
	2) separate the glass frame from the glass
	3) clean the glass (the black area where the frame attach to the glass), 	  
 apply a new black coating (the old one was pealing off)
	4) Glue the glass and the frame together
	5) Reinstall and readjust the hatch

	I was in heaven , they kept the car 1 1/2 day for the job (time for coating
and glue to dry). The job was professional .... OK if you look cose enough
you'll see some
imperfections but less important that the difference in price.

	I that time I was in LA area. If you're in that area I can give you the name
,
 it was a shop specialized in glass installation. Sniff Sniff now i'm back in
Montreal Canada area and the car is sitting in my garage on jackstand
patiently waiting for the hot season

Phellow Porschephiles:

Lots of discussion has occurred over the last several days, and I think
it's very, very important to let you all know what's going on behind the
scenes. In part because it's just the right thing to do, in part because
we need your continued participation.

There are two things happening in parallel, both of which may interest you.
We are establishing a non-profit foundation to support the perpetual
operation of the Porschephiles mailing list, it's enhancement and further
promotion. And we are investigating methods of gaining closer ties to 
the Porsche Club of America, PCNA, and Porsche AG.

Porschephiles Foundation
- ------------------------

Thanks to the tireless efforts Bart Chambers, instigated on by Fred Pack's 
initial efforts to raise the money to have the group buy my race car, we 
have a bank account, contributions banked, misc. paperwork flowing back and
forth, and have work underway to get this thing formalized.  This leads
of course to the inevitable discussion of how formalized, and in what form.

There has been discussion of running this as a membership organization,
with annual dues, and voting, and all that sort of thing. While that
certainly has merit, should be done if that's what enough of you want,
there are some significant problems with that approach. The organization
then has a fiduciary responsibility to do a certain style of accrual 
accounting and manage its funds so that n/12ths of a member's dues can be
refunded if they resign in the middle of their "year", and this has to slide
in a manner that lets every member have their own annual date. You have 
to conform to other specific practices regarding the decision making process,
you have to have annual meetings, and a pile of other stuff.

Since I was president of the Sun Users Group for the last 4 years, and a
director for the 6 preceeding that, I've had up close and personal experience 
with governance of large non-profit membership organizations. We can do it, 
but that may note be what best serves the group. So, I ask, how about a model 
that works more like Public Television?

With a Porschephiles Foundation, you can send in your "suggested" annual 
"membership", you can send in more, or if you're in a place to do so, you can 
become a "sponsor". Or, you can do nothing and just sit back and just watch 
the list roll past. There is no obligation, no funny accounting, nothing that 
adds to the cost of running the organization, or the headache for either you 
or me.

There would be a board of governors, initially selected by the members and 
self-renewing following that. There would be the usual non-profit organization 
safeguards to ensure that those charged with running the show weren't 
profiting from it. There would be recall and petition proceedures, but no 
unnecessary political bullshit that would get in the way of the primary 
objective: running the list in a high quality manner, keeping the bills paid, 
having enhancements made, and ensuring that there's aways a place for 
Porschephiles to hang out that's free of constraint and free of charge. Very 
much like we  have now, in fact, but with the involvement of some additional 
people and a much-needed influx of cash.

So, barring disaster, massive member dissent, or acts of Ferry, that's what is 
going to happen. Watch your mail for the initial proposed slate of governors, 
and further details on the formation of this entity.

Comments, offers to help (pro bono legal and accounting services are 
especially solicited), criticisms, etc should *ALL* be sent to the following 
address:
		comments@tta.com

and *NOT* sent to the list as a whole. Open discussion on the list is OK, but 
try to keep the "yeah, me too" and other items that do not add to a greater 
understanding the issues to a minimum.

This leads to the next issue:

Affiliation with PCA, PCNA, PAG
- -------------------------------

Like it or not, most of the Porsches on the road are in North America. Like it 
or not, most of the members of this list are in North America. Consequently, 
there is a distinct North American bias to this whole process. And like it or 
not, I'm a white male of Northern European extraction, to boot. It's not PC, 
but if that's important to you, you can kiss my ass anyway.

The upshot of that is that affiliation with PCA gains maximum benefit for all 
of the members of the list from a perspective of access to technical 
resources, access to the free use of certain intellectual property (the crest, 
the name "Porsche", and several other *minor* things), and exposure to a mass 
of potential members which have something significant to add (there are over 
34,000 members of the PCA; there are but 1200 of us. if you assume the usual 
PCA 10% rule holds, where roughly 10% of the membership of the organization 
actually *DOES* anything, we're still short 2000 members...). Plus, even if we 
don't actually affiliate with PCA, its' very, very wise to not have them as 
our opponent in other discussions with PCNA and PAG. So that's the direction 
this conversation is going to head. It does not preclude additional 
affiliation with PCNA or PAG, it's just a starting point.

Note that if we are organized as a non-profit foundation, that we don't need 
some of the benefits of affiliation with PCA. We can, and should, do that on 
our own. However, this PCA thing has to be explored.

There are some very, very key issues that were raised in the last couple of 
weeks. First on the list is the requirement that a region conform to the 
general bylaws of the PCA and the PCA requirement that you actually own a car 
before you an join. Second is the fact that PCA regions are typically defined 
by ZIP codes, and we're going to break that rather badly. Third is the world-
based nature of the list, with a lot of significant and valuable international 
members, and a very, very real potential to expand overseas with only a very 
little encouragement. These need to be resolved as part of the process and the 
matter needs to be brought to the attention of those people who have indicated 
that they want to be part of this.

For the roughly 200 people that sent me notes saying that you'd like to be 
either founding members or affiliate members of the Electronic Frontier Region 
of the PCA, you'll be getting a note early next week with a confirmation and 
some further questions that need to be addressed. This matter will not be 
dropped or allowed to slide; it will proceed in parallel with the 
establishment of the foundation. You will also be added to a separate mailing 
list so that we can keep traffic about the list formation off of the main list 
so as not to detract from its primary value -- being, as someone from PCNA 
recently put it "absolutely the best technical resource available for any 
Porsche owner."

Summary

Things are happening. You'll be seeing updates from time to time, and your

Hi, Jay,

Yes, most likely cause is the flange seal. Simple to replace:

1) disconnect half shaft from trans.

2) locate 6 mm allen bolt in center of flange, undo.

3) remove flange.  Note location of seal.

4) pull oil seal.

Installation is reverse of removal (learned that from haynes manuals...)

I understand that the 1988 Turbo S was a limited edition (of 1000?) that was
based on the Turbo Cup race car. I know it had a higher performance engine
and that it was available in only one body/interior color scheme. In 1989
the 944 Turbo (no S) had the same higher performance engine as the '88 Turbo
S. Does anyone know if there are any other differences between the two cars?

Sounds like you need a new thermostat, or your thermostat has been replaced
with one that opens at a lower temperature...

Replace it with the stock one and you will have no complaints about the
amount of heat that your system will generate...

Manufacturer seem to set speedo's => 10% fast, this saves them from legal 
probs where some idiot gets clocked for speeding then blames the 
manufacturer.

I have checked the calibration on several cars over the years, all 
running with std tyres, the worse was 11% fast, the best 5%

The odo is usually reasonably accurate though.

I checked each car by running at 60mph indicated for distances of 5 miles 
using the motorway mile posts as markers, each car was checked at least 
twice.

Why you may ask this interest in speedo calibration - boredom, stuck in 
heavy traffic....

Hi P-car p-eople:
I have question that you 356 experts may be able to help me with.  My '64
SC coupe was delivered in Italy and has Campagnolo magnesieum alloy wheels.
They appear to be the correct vintage for the car.  They require spacers
on the rear wheels and there is  very little room between the fender and
the tire edge, but there has never been any tire/body contact.  They look
good to my eye, but there's a big difference between these wheels and the
original equipment.  Since I'm selling the car these wheels could be a
strike against the car's value so I'm considering getting steel wheels and
selling these campy wheels seperately.  Does anyone have any idea where I
can get a value for these anomolies?  Is anyone interested in them (The
extra contact patch sure helps the cornering...)?  Anyone have a guess what
car they could have originally come on?

Thanks in advance,

Subject:      914 Idle

In a continuing effort to ensure excellence from my P-car, I ask the following
questions.  First to establish an index for comparison.  I recently tuned my
914 (1972 June manuf.date) replacing at the time plugs, points, plug wires,
hoses, etc. except the rubber hose running from the cylinder heads to the
flashback valve.  Since the tune-up the RPMs at idle no matter how cold the
engine never idles over 1200.  Usually after warm up the RPMs hover around the
800 level.
   Now the questions.  Since the weather has warmed up, after a run of 20-30
minutes at highway speeds, the RPMs drop at idle to about 300.  Yesterday after
a 30 minute drive, my P-car cut completely off at a traffic light.  The RPMs
dropped to 0.  It did it a second time at the next light.  The engine would
run normal if you keep a little accelerator pedal on when stopped.

Everything else seems normal and the engine does not indicate excessive
heating.

Any recommendations and/or suggestions welcomed.

(In Eastern NC yesterday, the temperature was 71 F and wonderful with the
top off!)

Subject: It's alive!! It's alive!!

Well, after 15 months of waiting for parts, money for parts, cleaning
parts, reassembling parts and just plain futzing around, the beast
has roared to life.  What an incredible feeling watching instrumentation
that had not worked or been turned on in over 13 years flicker to life.

The engine only took a few seconds of cranking before it caught and when
it did the whole house shook.  Scared the hell out of my wife, she came
running out to the garage thinking we were having an earthquake.  Once
the engine warmed and settled in a bit, it ran quite nice.

I already put about 20 miles on it this weekend.  In spite of bad tires,
tired suspension, a pair of tired carbs that I may replace, and lots
of other "little" things that still need to be done, it made an otherwise
bad week come to a very good end.  I think I had a smile on my face
the whole weekend.

It started on Saturday morning, and as I got so rapped up in tuning it
that I forgot completely about breakfast, lunch or dinner.  That
fact didn't hit me until I was slamming down a couple of celebratory
cold ones with my buddies and they hit pretty fast.  Oh well, it was all
worth it.

Of course, there are some minor flaws.  It tends to leak about 2 or 3
tablespoons of oil (what else!) after a drive.  Appears to be coming
from the pully end crankshaft seal.  I figured I installed this wrong
or something.  I've already ordered a new one to replace before I drive
it anymore.  Anyone have any idea how this would have happened?
Also a little backfiring, seems to be coming from cylinder 5.  I'm
guessing carbs being its so hard holding a steady idle.  Seems to
fluctuate between 850 and 1100.  The only gauge that seems to not work
is the oil level gauge.  Is this typical?

Those problems aside, I'm a happy camper.  First ever Porsche rebuild
and it RUNS!!  Even the wife had a big grin on her test ride.

Hi George

Is it possible that the bearing is worn, and hence enlargening the seal
hole, or do you generally find that the seals wear long before the
bearing? 

The reason I ask is that I have noticed a slight seapage on my trans and 
decided ( from past experience with other types of car ) that I would 
live with it rather than go and find a bigger problem.

Next obvious question, if the bearing is worn, how hard are they to replace?

I have also got slight dry scrape noise on my trans hich appears to be at 
engine speed, it is present in all gears and seems to vary directly with 
revs. When the car is at rest in neutral, the noise is present, but stops 
when I depress the clutch. I had figured that this is probably the input 
bearing. Any comment on what that can be, and the best cure.

I've had the same problem (not with a drivable car, as I don't store
them so they don't stay damp, but with a project car I'm working on
extremely slowly).  It was easy to clean up; I let it dry out first
and then just cleaned the leather with Lexol (it was only really growing
on the leather).  Just wiping it with anything would have probably
worked as well; by the time the car was reasonably dry the mold was all
dead and just brushed off, making quite a cloud.  I hope there's nothing

Apparently Kevin has never examined a modern motorcycle.

The car designers must have grown up driving vw's, and rulled out
air cooling because they wanted heat and defrosters.

Go to your friendly neighborhood VW Dealer (who,if he's like mine,
is neither particularly friendly nor particularly close to my neighborhood).
There purchase one each "All Purpose Cleaner". Key indicators here is it's
a plactic (white/clear) bottle with a yellow lable and black letters

I have *NO* idea what is in this stuff, but it cleans tar and nicotine

UK Porsche drivers of my ken like to drink beer warm because it is beer.

Why is US/german beer drunk cold? - simple because it is quite 
unpalatable warm. 

In short you have to anethetize (just had a pint of best Adnams) your
taste buds before you can drink Bud or any of the other rat poisons."

 - That is why the term "coolant" is a total mismoner for anti-freeze, it
makes you run hotter, not colder. Water Wetter has the opposite effect, it
dissipates the heat quicker but I don't believe it gives you any improvement
in coolant boiling temperature therefore as Jim Seld says, the addition of a
small amount of anti-freeze may be necessary if you system has tendency to
boil over..

The inside of ones lungs certainly qualify as warm, moist, dark places
(although the inside of my car where the mold grew couldn't have been
described as warm), but they also have an immune system that my car lacks.
Anyway, I didn't have any ill effects - at least not that I attributed to

Subject: 944 black smoke problem

Hi Porschephilers,

 I've been living with a black smoke problem on my 84 944 since
 I bought it last November, and am ready now to get serious about
 finding out the cause and fixing it.  Here's what I know:

  - Under heavy acceleration, the exhaust looks fine up to 3500rpm,
    at which point it becomes very black (as if it's running VERY rich).
    When the rpm drops back down, the black smoke clears.  The tailpipe,
    and even some of the close-by paint, are very sooty.  
  - The engine idles rough (probably why the previous owner set
    the idle speed to 1100rpm).  Above 1200rpm the engine smooths
    out nicely.  The idle roughness mostly disappears as the car
    warms up, but never is quite right.
  - I replaced the oxygen sensor, and a quick checked showed it
    oscillating at idle between .4v and 1.0v or so, at about
    a 2 second interval.  Seemed about right to me.
  - I had the CO adjusted.  It was a little rich, but easily adjusted
    to spec.  Anyway, neither the black smoke nor the idle improved.
  - I assume (maybe wrongly) that my oil-burn problem is not related.
    I go thru 1 qt per 600 miles, have high (20%) leakdown on one
    cylinder, but NO visible bluish smoke.  Of course, when the black
    smoke is present, I probably wouldn't see anything else,
    but at lower RPMs the exhaust is clean.  This oil-burn
    is obvious a serious matter in itself, but I'd like to fix the
    'easy' ones before going after that one.
  
 So . . . 
    - what should I check next?
    - if this car has had a black smoke problem for years, are
      exhaust system components, such as the catalytic converter,
      likely to be clogged?


Thanks for any help,

Tom-

Hey!  Wonderful news!  Great feeling , too, isn't it?  
Congratulations!

The one other really great thing is that everytime you get in that 
car from now on, every time you turn the key and it sputters to 
life, you'll get a bit of the same feeling you did last weekend.

On the oil leak near the pulley, check the "front cover".  Make 
sure that's not where the leak is coming from.  The surface has to 
be reasonably flat.  On the oil gauge, apparently they never 
quite operate pefectly.  On my '72 it's easy to see why.  I don't 
know if that's true in a '70.  If you peer down the oil filler tube 
while the engine is running you can see oil gushing about, 
sloshing andslushing, so to speak. The oil level sender is an arm 
and float, like the float ball in a toilet hopper, and there's no way 
it can stay at a reasonably constant level with all that oil moving 
this way and that.
Further, there is considerable expansion as the oil heats up, and 
it significantly changes the reading of the gauge.  You may not 
have gotten it warmed up enough in your 20 miles of total 
maiden voyages.

Anyway, thems are minor things.  You have the big one under 
control!

Subject: 944 Not Warming Up

Joseph, Try this simple test: while your car is cold, i.e. not driven for at
least an hour, turn the key to the on position without starting the engine (make
sure the A/C control knob is off) then check to see if the electric fans are
running.  If they are that is your problem, as they should normally only run
during prolonged idling, which is the only time your car starts to heat up.
There is a separate relay in the Air Conditioning system which switches the fans
on whenever you switch on the A/C.  This relay can force the fans to run all the
time.  The normal fan switch in the radiator will do the same thing and also
keep one fan running at a slower speed even with the key out, if it is stuck in
the shut position, my car has this very problem right now.

Subject: The Empirical formula of Oil filter exchanges.. :) 

Hiall,

Thus not strictly Porsche related I'd like to share some interesting
gatherings.

My daily driver, the 'olde F**d' has been the testing bed for a new
'low tech' series of Engine Maintenance routines.

First:
When should I change Oil and filter and how to determine this?
**************************************************************
Data:

After 0 kilometer with new filter and oil, the oil lamp goes off
almost immideatly after engine starts.

After 5000 kilometer I have about 2 seconds delay before the oil light
goes off. 

After 15000 kilometer (Yes, I'm cheap... ;) I'm up to almost 4 seconds
before the lamp goes off...start to get intimidating.

The change of oil and filter at this moment brings down the delay to
almost 0 again.  

I've run the 0-15000 km 'data gathering' twice, and the pattern was
similar in both 'tests'.
(..I used electric engine heater in the wintertime, so the temperature
range from which I started the engine shouldn't have a delta over 10
degrees Celsius.)

Advice;
If you under (~constant outdoor temperatures) notice an increase in
delay of oil lamp going off, change oil! (You should assure that the
engine temperature is similar in test cases though.)

*********************************************************************
Fuel consumption versus mileage with the new air filter:

Two tests were run, in the first I had no significant increase in
fuel consumption from 0 to 15000 kilometres. This was Spring to early
winter kilometres. (Mostly long nice weather weekend trips)

In the second test I noticed about 4 % increase in fuel consumption
from 0 to 1000 kilometres, from there up to 15000 kilometres I got a
whopping 35 % increase. 

Advice?

Due to the random factor of weather there was no pattern from the two
tests I could use, therefore;

Inspect Air filter at least every 5000 kilometres (3500 miles), if
dirty replace.

AM signals are far more prone to interference, so bad connections tend to 
have more effect on AM signals - so check that the antenna coax is pushed 
fully home, also check the connections to the pre-amp and the windshield 
antenna itself.

It is possible that the pre-amp is not even powered, if you live in an 
area with good FM coverage, the FM signals probably get through even 
without the antenna plugged in.

Not least of which is that membership would sink to a fraction of what it
currently is - not many people who subscribe to the Internet seem to be
prepared to pay for anything, regardless of quality. Whilst a reduction
in membership would be advantageous in some ways (like, I could read it all!)
I wonder if porschephiles would suffer because of it?

But will it continue that way? I suspect the biggest internet growth

What percentage of membership is non US, about 5-10% I suspect. Why not register with

I had an '86 944 in Fort McMurray, AB for a couple of years. I had an oil
pan heater installed (at Eurasia, Edmonton) and a Canadian Tire battery
blanket. This was good for starts in -28 C or warmer. Beyond that I just
waited for the next "warm front". No other major cold related problems.

I've moved back to the relative warmth of Halifax and no longer have to
worry about heating accessories. ( just more car washes !)

I spent 5 years in Fort McMurray, AB, 3 winters with my 944. I had Eurasia
(Edmonton) install a oil pan heater and Canadian tire installed a battery
blanket. With both turned on for a couple of hours, I was able to start the
car in about -28 C or warmer. Below that I just left it until a "warm
front" appeared. I had the car outside so if you have a garage you should
do better. Other than starting I had no major cold related related
problems, except for a small brake fluid leak at the master cylinder that
cleared up with warmer weather.

I have returned to the relative warmth of Halifax and fortunately no longer
need the aformentioned heating equipment.(just more car washes !)

Subject: 944 wheel repair question

Hello All;

Friday was a bad day in Greenbelt.  On the way to work someone decided to change 
lanes right into the side of my '89 951.  Mostly only sheet metal damage.  He 
got the right door and rear quarter panel.  As a result of the contact, both 
rear wheel lips were scraped up.  The hubs seem fine.  The left wheel got it 
worse as the back end was pinned between the curb on the median strip and the 
other car.

The body shop (Elite Autohaus is Jessup, Maryland) said the wheels could be 
repaired by putting them on a device similar to a brake lathe.  They use a place 
called Wheel Works to do the work.  Has anybody had experience with this type of 
repair to forged alloys?  Will they be weaker as a result of the repair? 
Obviously I would rather have new wheels, but how do I explain to the insurance 
adjuster the need for strong wheels at 130mph at Summit Point?  Thanks in 
advance.

There are several places that advertise in Pano that do this kind of work.

The effect on wheel strength would be a function of how much metal is
removed, and from where it is removed...

Probably not enough metal will be removed to affect the strength of your
forged wheels...  If the gouges are deep enough for you to be worried about
this, junk them and buy some new ones or even some used ones...

Good luck

Does anyone know anything about "Accu-balancing" ?  Yesterday, I went to a
local Wheel Works to have a flat fixed for free on my Maxima, and they talked
me into this new "state of the art" tire truing procedure.  The procedure
involves turning the tire slowly with a load applied to it, then buffing
(grinding) of the so called high spots based on the flexing.  When the buffing
is complete, they do a regular spin balance.   Is this a worth while procedure
or just another way to separate a customer from his/her money?  ($12/tire).
My free flat repair (screw in the tire) ended up costing $48.

You might want to check for an adjustment to match the antenna to the radio.
Usually a small coil or cap accessible through a hole near the antenna
jack on the radio. This is not an issue with factory radios as they are 
already set up for the antenna config. of the car. Aftermarket, esp. older
units are a different story.

I know of at least one case in which the second owner of a vehicle (924S)
received goodwill warranty work (out of warranty by at least a year) on his
oil cooler seals.

Probably depends on whether or not PCNA feels that the problem should have
not been engineered in...

Tracy,

If your damage is limited to the inner or outer "lips" as you call
them, I think that taking a little metal off would probably not be
a real problem.

For more serious repair (straightening, welding), Porsche's answer
would be a resounding no.  I am pretty sure that tech bulletins to
that effect exist, and presenting them to your adjuster should
be all that s/he needs to OK new rims.

If you have scraped or scuffed the anodized surface of the Design
90 style wheel, it cannot to my knowledge be restored.

Subject: RE: 944 black smoke problem


Ron,

I would begin by doing the following.  Pack up your spark plug wrench
and go for a drive.  Find a road which isn't too busy, run the car up to
the point at which it is making the black smoke, then immediately shut
down the engine, park the car, and pull each of the four plugs.  You
want to find out whether the problem is common to all cylinders or is
specific to one, perhaps the one with the high leak down.

Let's assume it's common.  If you have unburnt fuel, it will be because
you either have too much fuel, too little spark, or a compression
problem.  You know that compression is OK on three cylinders, so
eliminate that for the time being.

Too much fuel could come from a bad air flow meter or perhaps an
injector which is hanging up.  I posted something in the past few weeks
regarding checking the AFM: check its output signal as you sweep
its barn door from limit to limit.  Injectors are a little harder to check,
but you can pull the rail, run the fuel pump with the coil disconnected,
and get a qualitative idea of their comparative output.  I think Probst
covers this is his book -- worth reading.

Too little spark could result from a bad coil, wires, plugs, and a number
of other sources.  Check the battery voltage at RPM and the alternator
output.  Check the coil impedences and the wire impedences, including
the wire from the coil to the cap.  Check the cap and rotor while you're
at it.

If you run way rich, unburnt fuel will get burnt within the rather hot 
catalytic
converter, and that will indeed met it.  Also, if you dump too much fuel
into a cylinder, it will wash the cylinder's walls of lubrication, which 
will
lead to damaging the rings and the wall surface.  Perhaps this is why
you have bad leak-down on one of your cylinders.

Jim: 
 
Initially there is both a written and a practical driver's test. 
 
Once the practical test is taken successfully, only the written test is 
required until you're 60 or so.  In addition, if you establish a perfect 
driving record you can renew every other time without taking the written test. 
 The license is good for 4 years. 
 
Far from perfect, but by and large my experience has been the Califiornians 
are pretty good drivers . . . at least on the freeways that I travel routinely. 
 
The two biggest sins I've been noticing of late: following other cars far to 
closely for the speed and changing lanes/turning without signalling. 
 
The latter is especially onerous given the fact that the CHP recently made it 
known that something like 90% of the accidents on California roads and 
freeways  are the result of drivers failing to signal their intentions!

Michael,

No driver test, just the written and you get three tries you get it right?? 
I think I would be more worried about the driver skill level than their

Subject: Re: 944 Motor Mount repair questions.

Steve,

I am not a professional mechanic, but over the past 6 years I have
replaced probably 4 sets of motor mounts.  My technic may not
be the recommended method, but it worked great those 4 times.

I don't have any advise on the Automation "kit" as I have
always purchased just the regular 944 turbo motor mount.  I do
not know what else Automation would put in the kit.

Oh well, here is what I do:

1) Jack front of car and support with jack stands.

2) Unbolt existing mounts.

3) Use engine lift (or hoist rig or in my case my dad's fork
   lift and a chain) to lift the engine off the motor mounts.
   I lifted from both engine hooks (front & back).  The lifting
   is the tricky part.  Lift too high and you might damage the
   exhaust system/headers, etc.

4) Once you lift high enough to remove old mounts, insert new ones.
   You will find they are taller and you will probably have to
   lift the engine some more.  You will also have to twist & turn &
   crowbar the things in place - but it can be done.  Make sure they
   are inserted the right way.

5) Lower engine & tighten bolts.

Other things to try:
  ? Do one side at a time, lifting only one side???
  ? Disconnecting exhaust system to prevent damage.
  ? Lift engine from underneath.

Good luck,

I own a 1980 931, but I experienced the same problem you described.  The problem turned out to be a crack in the air hose between the air flow sensor and the turbo inlet.  This caused the engine to run lean and cut out at idle.  

I would check all hoses.  Even with this leak, I readjusted the mixture ratio to correct the problem until I got a new hose.

Subject: SUMMARY: BFG Comp T/A R1

This is logn overdue, but here it is: I got a number of responses from
helpful individuals.  These responses gave me some hints as to what the
part numbers meant on the data sheets I got from BFG.  In the beginning I
did not understand what 230 and 226 meant and how the numbers tied into
the Comp T/A R1, but crosschecking with the data sheets made it very
obvious (thus I learned something new!!) 230 is the competition (Road Race
in BFGtalk) R1 tire.  226 is the autocross R1 tire.  The data sheets that
were mailed on Feb 15, 1995 listed only 11 sizes of the R1 226 type left in
current stock, compared to 21 sizes of the R1 230 type.  Basically, as fellow
Porschephilers pointed out, the R1 226 type has been discontinued, only what
is left over is available. 

The data sheets also mention the BFG R1 204 Competition (BFGtalk again) 
type. None of the responses I got mentioned this tire, so I cannot offer 
information on this one.

So to sum it up: forget the BFG R1 226 unless what is in stock fits your
car.  Get the BFG R1 230 which seems to have impressed a lot of drivers.

Here are the responses I received(thanks guys!)
__________
From: noorder@btg.com
I would strongly suggest that you become a Team TA member if you
are going to be doing any racing on BFG's.  It is free and you will
get a monthly newsletter, be eligible for close-outs on tires,
get discounts from some vendors, etc.  Call (800) RACE-BFG and
they will be happy to sign you up.

The BFG 226 (autocross) has indead been discontinued.  The only tire
availble is the BFG 230 (competition) tire.  This tire is still more
competitive then the current generation Yokohama tire (RS-II).

From: Michael Willis <mswillis@ix.netcom.com>
My understand is that the autox version has been discontued.

From: Mike Lommatzsch <mpl@netcom.com>
Menelaos -

Forget about the autocross compound tire for now.  I t is no longer 
available from BFG as they are sticking to their 230 tire for the 
expected victories.

___________
From: Scott Winders <winders@support.apple.com>
Menelaos,

The Autocross version, the BFG R1 226 compound, is no longer available.
The 230 compound is a very nice tire that is better (faster) than any
version of the Yokohama RS tire. I used the Yokohama RS II (autocross
compound) tire last year and switched to the BFG R1 230 compound this
year. I can already tell that it is a much faster tire. My local
competition has to worry a little bit more this year ;-).

Get the BFG R1 230 compound, you will be happy you did.

Kevin, you're the one who made a blanket inaccurate statement
to the list that multi-valving was NOT POSSIBLE
for air cooled motors.  I only corrected the statement
based on experience outside the Porsche realm.

A 1 liter 4 valve 150hp motorcycle powerplant is hardly
as you say "what can be made to work".   It IS pretty
darn good engineering. 

From my observations, the list membership as
a whole acknowledges the cross over engineering from 
other fields including motorcycles, aircraft, etc.
The same laws of physics apply to all vehicles.

Your reference to kitchen appliances, and chain saws was
an un-called-for exageration.

No one knows it all, that's why we have a list.  Just limit

Subject: Tire Mounting Advice Sought

I'd like some advice on tire mounting ...

In the past I've had my tires mounted at Dinan (the BMW tuners), but their
machine grips the inside "back" of the wheel in such a way to leave
permanent little dimple marks, as if one took an automatic center punch to
the wheel. They claim "that's just how the machine works." To their credit,
I do end up with well-balanced wheels, but I find it hard to believe that
it's physically necessary to dig into aluminum wheels in order to mount
tires on them.

I've never seen any marks on aluminum wheels from the factory.  Can anyone
recommend a particular brand of wheel-mounting machine that does not mar
the wheel?  I'm concerned with 15"-18" wheels, 6"-9" widths.

Also, any recommendations for tire mounting places in the San Francisco Bay
Area?

Thanks,

Randy-

I own a 84 944 with a power sunroof.  The electric motor went two years ago,
taking the cable with it.  I brought it to the dealer and found that Porsche
had 'updated' the part, and I needed some significant modifications made to
my roof mount, plus parts, we were talking $1500+.

I called Porsche North America and spoke to Hank???, sorry, can't remember
his name.  Said that I had been through the water pump upgrade, the engine mou
nt thing a couple of times, and felt that I had lived through more than my
share of payments for components that should have been designed correctly the
first time.  He aggreed, and Porsche payed for all the parts and split the
labor.  I am the original owner, but the question never came up.

He did comment, that being nice and friendly on the phone put me in a very
small minority of callers, and it did contribute to his helping me out on this
 one.

Subject: 911 Hidden Mold

Hi Folks -

Speaking of moldy cars... last year I made the mistake of rinsing some
salt spray off my 911, using a spray gun, while the engine was idling
and the heater was on.  I believe that some water got sucked into the
fan and pumped thru the heat exchangers and into the heater ducts,
because during the following couple of weeks I began to notice the smell
of Something Growing whenever I had the heat on.  Not a totally awful
smell, just a wet-dog sort of smell, annoying and embarrassing but not
life threatening.  *However* it has not gone away with the passage of
time, or rather, it comes back whenever the weather's damp.

I theorize that some kind of single-celled life form (er, I HOPE it's
single celled!) has colonized the heater ducts that are built into the
frame rails.  Whatever it is seems to survive extended runs with the
heater on full blast, which is pretty hot ("dammit, Scotty, more power!"
"Thot's ooll she's got, Cap'n!").  

Has anyone else ever experienced this?  Does anyone know of a
fumigant/deodorant that might be pumped thru the ducts to wipe out this
life form?  Things like this must happen to you folks in the Southeast
occasionally...

As for the rest of you: DON'T wash your 911 with the engine running and
the heater on, or if you do, drive far enough to dry out the ducts.

     I had a similar phenomenon with my Rabbit the other day.  I was 
checking some wiring and started the car up and basically the same thing 
happened.  Poor idle, backfiring...I found that the control plug to the 
frequency valve (CIS K-jetronic) came off.  I have a 944 and know the 
systems are different, but some similar control scheme could be causing the 
same problems.  On my car the frequency valve basically adjusts the amount 
of fuel sent to the injectors, which is controlled by the black box.  Maybe 
it could be even a disconnected O2 sensor (I think that might make it run 
rich--I'd have to think about it--but you said you checked that.)  I've been 
in the process of trying to fix a low mpg problem in the Rabbit so I've done 
a little studying mainly from the Probst book and my Bentley manuals.

If Kirk S. sees this maybe he can lend a theory or two.  (We are EE's that

My friend,

You have a large vacuum leak.

Look to make sure that the large (3/4 inch diameter) hose is connected at
the bottom of the intake manifold (near the back of the air filter
housing...)

Otherwise, look for some disconnected hose.

You have the classic symptoms of a good-sized leak...

Good luck

One could argue that (on a Porsche mailing list) references to
motorcycles are irrelevant.

Kevin's point is that the differences in the design parameters
for automobiles vs motorcycles vs lawnmowers vs chain saws
(ad infinitum) are *not* insignificant.  (Consider that motorcycles
don't have to worry about heating a passenger compartment, engine
cooling vs bodywork, etc.)  So... what works for a motorcycle may
not work for an automobile.

If Porsche's engineers say that 4V air-cooled engines won't work
in an *automobile*, I'm inclined to believe them.  What specific
engineering data do *you* have that refutes their claim *for
automobiles*.

Now, lighten up!!!  And take your medication tomorrow.  ;-)

=======================
Jan, have you re-connected all hoses? Sounds like you might have a vacuum
leak somewhere that is confusing the air meter.

There a number of hoses running under the intake manifold, providing vacuum to
the brake booster, charcoal canister, etc. 

Also, did you plug any of the intake manifold tubes? 

And BTW, sorry to hear about your valves! I bent two of mine some time ago...

Hi Mark,

An "RC" store is a Radio Control store. Usually a hobby shop will specialize
in various types of sport. In our case, we like radio controlled cars. 

Either a hobby store specializing in cars or planes should have the chrome
sheets. We did not have to enhance the adhesive at all. The product is made
to withstand some abuse from the RC cars and buggies.

Good luck, let me know how it turns out!!

Has anyone ever heard of any driver getting a ticket for a failure
to make a signal (outside of an crash situation)?  I don't go around

Right - you aren't supposed to use an oversized bearing on a stock journal.
You have to get the clearance right. That's where the plastiguage comes in.

Right enough. You use it on the actual pieces that you plan to use "from here
on". It seems pretty foolish to go through all the effort of the dissassembly
and reassembly of your precious engine without replacing any and all wear
items such as bearings, rings, etc.

What do you mean "again"? Are these "new, used standard sized bearings"?
No such thing.

Absolutely. Or maybe it suggests that you made some other kind of mistake.

David,

My brother once got pulled over and given a warning for failing to signal 
a lane change on the interstate.  I think they were just picking on him, 
he was 16, driving my fathers 944 Cab at the time.  He has also been 
pulled over for excessive acceleration and separately for revving his 
engine.  He got a lecture from the state cop on why it was dangerous and 
bla bla bla.  The cop then started asking him about the car.

The one that take sthe cake, is what happened when he was driving his 
3000GT VR4 at about 2:30 AM in Clarksburg, he had just finished 
lifeguarding for a YMCA special event (i.e. being a good citizen) and was 
on his was home.  The cop pulled him over, came up to the window, and 
explaine, "Son do you realize that you were going 24 in a 25 mph zone?"  
Excuse me, but so what?  The cop said that he just looked suspicious.  
Meaniwhile, across town, there was probably a murder or something.

I forgot to mention that all of the above happened in West Virginia.

directly from Porsche at reasonable prices (Stoddard is in fact a
Porsche dealer, but they carry parts from other manufacturers too when
the Porsche part is not available).


> Engine Work		1	1000	1000	

Is your engine work estimate for rebuilding the engine?? If so, the
estimate is a bit low.  The cost of new pistons and cylinders alone
will be around $1000.  Plan on about $2000 for a rebuild, $3000 if
someone else does the entire rebuild for you.

Hope this helps!
You'll love your 912 when you're done!

Subject: 944 motor mounts/ important

Just received a Technical Bulletin straight from Porsche. 
Once again they have an UPDATED engine mount for all 944 series cars. They
include 924S, 944/S/S2/T. all years. 
The new mount # 951 375 042 04, supersedes the former version, 951 375 042
05. In a startling reversal it is no longer a hydraulic unit, but is spring
loaded. It is longer than the old mount thereby eliminating the 4mm spacer
used in the old model (on the right side). 
This mount is applicable to either side of the engine. They are also saying
that you can mix and match so you need not replace both mounts at the same
time. They are also a bit pricey although I don't have the exact numbers. I
do know that they are more expensive than the supersceeded part.(surprize)
BTW you don't have to have a vibration problem to need a new mount. The
factory would have you replace mounts if the engine oil pan drops below the
lowest point of the front crossmember. Something about not tearing out your
oil pan if you encounter an obstacle.

Dear Pfiles,

As of Sunday, I'm a Pfile again since I sold my
'76 914 2.0L way back in the mid 80s.  I've regretted
it ever since but now I've repent :-)

I just bought a '76 914 2.0L.  Here are the good things about it:

 - 71K original miles (as far as I can tell), 2 previous owners
 - original lime green color, been repainted
 - very straight body with minimal rust
 - nice interior, 1 minor tear on the driver seat
 - runs strong, no leaks
 - all the little things (lights, switches, handles...) work

The bads:

 - Riviera rims gotta go.  For unknown reasons, I never liked 'em.
 - not an Appearance Group
 - I need a 3 car garage, or more :-)

The neutrals: (I'm not sure if it a good thing or not)

 - rear fenders pulled ever so slightly to accommodate
  wider tires.  Currently has 195/60s but with room to 
  spare for 205/60s.

Needed repairs:

 - needs muffler
 - front end vibrate a bit, probably tires off balance or 
  needs new rubber joints???
 - brake job
 - needs antennae and stereo
 - add the Appearance Group stuff
 - replace wheels 

I will read (or at least try) all the digests first 
before I start my barrage of questions.

Meanwhile, if anyone has back copies of 
the "914 Owner's Association" or any other 
publications with 914 related goodies that 
you're willing to sell/rent/loan... please
let me know.  I want to start to catch up 
to what I've missed the last decade or so.

Thanks for your time.  If you have any suggestions/opinions/...
or spare parts please let me know. 

Sorry for the longish post.  I promise to keep them
short in the future.

I agree with John Lupien, it's just a safety net. It's also the
only way to make sure the bearings are what they say they are.
The chances of having mismarked or out of spec bearing shells 
is probably about nothing, but as the man says "do you feel lucky?"

One BIG word of caution: Rod bolts aren't reusable after they've
been torqued down so you have to use the old bolts when you check
clearances "at torque" with the plastigauge.

It's just one of those things I do, like writing down torque
readings on an engine diagram as I do them -- so I can sleep
at night - or drive 100+ mph without getting ulcers.

The heat in my 951 S has the nasty habit of disappearing when I come to a

seems to take a little bit longer than usual. My local dealer recently
replaced a thermostat near the turbo to know avail. He now thinks that the
heater core could be gummed up. Could this be the problem?

Also, he says that a heater core is not covered under the 1 year dealer

A couple of questions:

1) Does the temperature gauge follow these fluctuations?

2) Have you checked the heater valve (located near the waterpump) that is
operated by a vacuum diaphragm (controls the flow of coolant to the heater
core...)

Heater core is probably not the problem... More likely the wrong thermostat
(located inside the waterpump.) I would remove and test the thermostat
first, or just replace with the proper new one...

Of course, in Canada, your kilometerage may vary.

One question: What does your *written* copy of the warranty say?

If it specifically states that it does or does not cover the heater core,
then that is the case.  If not, then PCNA's lawyers have not done their
job...

I'm probably gonna put new tires on my 914 before it 
goes back on the road for the spring... It currently 
has 195/50/15s, mostly because a friend found a 
decent set of them lying around. (Phoenix 
Stahlflexes... Remember them?) Anyways, I'm 
debating either going sticking with a 195/50/15 and 
going with a Comp T/A ZR tire, or moving to a 
205/60/15, with an AVS Intermediate tire. Right now 
it seems like there'd be plenty of room between the 
tires and the fenders, but then the 50-series barely 
go into the fenders. (That's one of my problems, they 
just look too small!)

Any suggestions or thoughts? Thanks much.

YES!  It was in the S.F. Bay Area, and my friend got it.  The Cop pulled 
him over speciffically for this violation, and wrote him up for it.
However this is the only ocasion I've heard of but the ticket did seem
to be for alot of money.

No kidding, I see this routinely here in Santa Barbara County where traffic
can generally be considered light to moderate.  Seems that my poor little
911 attracts it's share of tailgaiters.  At 70 mph, I've had people follow
me so closely that I can't even see any space between our two cars!  The
worst violators are drivers of "Sport Utillity Vehicles".  I guess they
figure that if the need to stop rapidly occurs, they'll just launch off the
back of my 911!

Interesting since I estimate that over 90% of law enforcemnt officers (CHP
included) fail to use their signals at *any* time.  This is particularly
troublesome considering that these people are supposed to be "professional"
drivers.  They set a poor example.

When I was a kid, driving seemed a joy in California.  Drivers were
generally polite and they generally signaled their intentions.  I remember
my dad complaining about lack of signaling and rude drivers on our summer
trips outside of California.  Now the is the norm throughout the country
rather than the exception.

But, what can you do?

You must be new around here, eh?  Not that being new is a crime, but
there's a concept at work here called "context"..... Not that some people

as though he was somehow unaware there are multivalved aircoolers in the

Sort of like calling Bruce Anderson and informing him that his credibility

Chill dude, and consider the context (not to mention the flame-ee).

Below are some thoughts on checking the 911 rear defogger operation.
It took me a while to get around to it.

There should be enough information here to help test defogger elements
at swap meets/salvage yards.

For a lot of people it will be "been there, done that".

It's long, so here is a short summary. 

  From the engine compartment, make some resistance measurements, 
  calculate estimated power, measure voltage drop across relay contacts 
  to verify relay is ok, measure supply current and verify actual power
  is close to calculated power.

  There is also a procedure to probe for single "opens" in defogger grids
  if you want to attempt a repair.

This discussion assumes you have access to a digital multimeter (DMM). 

For around USD 100 you will get an autoranging DMM with 10A current range, 
0.1 ohm resolution, digital display and fast responding analog bar graph.
I own one of these and it has worked well for the 10 years I've had it.

If you don't want to get a high quality DMM, than an inexpensive DMM
might be adequate.

You CAN get a bare bones Chinese import 3 1/2 digit DMM with 10A current
measuring range, 5 DC ranges from 200mv to 1000 VDC, and 0.1 ohm resolution
for USD 15.00.  

This does NOT have the analog bar graph, auto ranging, sensitive AC 
voltage/AC current measurements or continuity beeper of the higher priced
DMMs.

The import DMM is likely not as mechanically/electrically rugged as
the more expensive DMM, but it is about 1/8th the price.

I keep the Chinese import DMM in my "swap meet" backpack (along with my
Chinese vernier calipers). 

Most of the defogger troubleshooting is done from the engine compartment,
since this is where the defogger relay, fuse and wiring harness originate.

A nominal 12 volt battery voltage is used in the discussion. 

For power calculations, I ignored voltage drops in supply leads, relay
contacts and connectors.

There is no +/- accuracy range on the measurements here.  These are to be 
regarded as characteristic measurements, not EXACT values.

But a typical decent DMM will resolve to 0.1 ohms on the 300 ohm range with an 
absolute accuracy of +/- (0.2 ohms + 0.7% of reading).

I used my USA "name brand" DMM for the measurements listed here.

Extrapolate to other than 69/72 years at your own risk.

911 rear defogger background information:

  The single heat defogger (69 911T coupe at least) has 9 elements and is
  rated at 100 watts (according to the 69/70 parts manual).

  The dual heat defoggers on 911's are split into three sections, and the
  wiring has the top + bottom as the 150 watt section and the middle
  as the 100 watt section.  Also according to the 72/73 911 parts manual.
  So this totals to 250 watts.

  The German language section of the 72/73 parts manual lists the
  rear Targa window at 300 watts.  

  Same part number, same electrical system as the USA version.

  Maybe the German rating is spec'ed at 13.8 volts (running voltage) and 
  the US at 12.6 volts (battery voltage), since this mathematically
  accounts for the difference.

  Essentially the "dual" heat defogger has 3 elements in the top section
                                           9                 middle
                                           7                 bottom

  This is true of both the coupe and Targa, at least for the two Targa
  glasses and one dual element coupe I looked at.

  The dual heat elements are electrically connected like this

  For the dual heat elements, this relay is a special rectangular shaped
  relay in the engine compartment.

  For the single heat elements, this relay is one of the "round" relays
  that is common on the 911.  It is also in the engine compartment.

       >< = defogger wiring connector inside engine compartment.

       |
       V  = ground lug on left side of engine compartment.

  First off, I'm skeptical the defogger 150 watt element is actually 150 watts.

  If each element is the same length (approx. true for a coupe rear window) 
  and has approximately the same cross-sectional area, I'd expect each segment
  have the same resistance and dissipate about the same power, so the center
  section of 9 elements would be about 9/10 the power of the top + bottom
  combined.  This would put the top + bottom at 100 watts * 10/9 = 111 watts,
  not 150.

  Maybe the top/bottom elements are thicker/wider than the middle elements.  

  The measurements I made on a USED coupe window indicate the center dissipates
  about the SAME power as the top + bottom combined.  

I. DMM Ohmmeter check with NO voltage to the defogger.

  1. Unplug the defogger connector in the left side of the engine compartment.

  2. Now measure the resistance from each of the exposed defogger connector
     pins TO the GROUND BOLT behind the Bosch CDI (1972 911T). 
     A new defogger should read about 1.44ohms on the 100watt section and 0.96
     ohms on the 150watt element.

     This is from the formula R = (V^2)/power  = 144/power.

  My experience is that defoggers tend to have scratched open segments or 
  be burned out so you won't get numbers close to the factory fresh values.

  This corresponds to measuring the resistance from 1 to 3 and 2 to 3
  in the above diagram.

  You are measuring 

        R          +  R                + R
        +12v lead     heating element    ground return

  After you make the measurement, you can calculate the approx. power your
  defogger grid will produce by

       Power = (V^2)/R  = 144/R

  I measured my spare "swap meet" three section coupe defogger window 
  (out of car) and came up with

            4.3 ohms for the top section of 3 elements
            1.5              middle         9 elements
            2.2              bottom         7 elements

  If you measure the window in the car, the top and bottom should measure
  a parallel resistance of ~ 1.5 ohms.

  I subtracted the DMM lead resistance (~0.2 ohms) from the actual readings 
  for the above chart.

  This corresponds (at 12 volts) to

           33.5 watts for the top
           96 watts for the middle section
           65 watts for the bottom

  So top + bottom totals 98.5 watts and top + bottom + middle = ~195 watts.

  These values correspond fairly well with the expected power levels, with 
  the top + bottom being low (stated 150, expected 111 watts, and ohmmeter
  measurement indicated a calculated 96).

  When I did this on my installed 72T Targa window, I measured

     2.7 ohms for one section
     3.5 ohms for the other section

     The parallel resistance of the two sections is 1.52 ohms,
     calculating to 7.89A (95 watts) with both sections on.

     So it runs at less than half rated power.

  3. Now measure the resistance from one of the exposed defogger connector
     pins TO the other defogger connector pin.  This should be slightly lower
     than the SUM of the readings in step 2, since you are measuring the series
     resistance of both elements without returning through the ground lead.

     You are measuring:

        R           +  R                  + R                 + R
        +12v lead1     heating element1     heating element2    +12v lead2

     The difference between the this reading and the SUM of step 2 should
     approximate twice the resistance of the defogger ground return lead,
     since the ground return lead resistance is included in BOTH of the
     step 2 readings.

     When I did this I measured 6.1 ohms.  The sum of the two step 2 readings
     was 6.2 ohms.  Given the stated accuracy of the ohmmeter of +-0.2ohms,
     one can't determine the actual ground resistance with any accuracy.

     But, it did not measure at any significant resistance.
     
     If the sum of the step 2 readings is much higher than step 3, than 
     you have a poor/open ground connection.

  This resistance check could be made as part of a pre-purchase inspection
  and be done fairly quickly.

  If the grid measures at a high resistance, on to step II to see if the
  defogger grid is itself bad.

II. Resistance Measurements at defogger grid itself INSIDE the car

  Purpose of the test:

    See if the resistance readings at the defogger grid agree with
    the ones taken from the engine defogger connector.  This will
    let you know if the defogger grid is OK, but the wiring harness
    leading to it is not.

  Power to the defogger is OFF.

  This can be skipped if I. gives decent results.

  With the DMM in ohms mode, probe at one ground tab (USA passenger
  side of window) and the +12 supply lead at the USA drivers side of the
  window at each of the two sections (middle, upper+lower) and record the
  readings. 

  With the window in the car, the top and bottom elements are in parallel,
  so you can't read them independently unless you unplug the jumper wire
  inside the window gasket.  If you do measure a different number while 
  probing at the top and bottom, then the jumper wire connecting the
  two sections is not making a good contact.

  The resistance measurements should be somewhat less than the values 
  measured from the engine compartment since you're not measuring the 
  supply leads.  
    
  If you get a large difference in resistance measurements, you have
  a bad connection to +12volt supply lead(s).

  Check that the slide on terminals in the rear window gasket are not 
  corroded and are firmly in position.

III. Supply voltage to defogger connector checking.

  The purpose of the test is to see if the defogger grid is getting
  12 volts thru the defogger relays/defogger switch.

  It won't be necessary to have the car running to do this test,
  as a new defogger at full power would take about 4 hours to
  completely discharge an 80 amp-hour battery.

  The ignition switch must be in the ON position for the defogger to get 
  power.

  1. Slightly separate the defogger connector in the engine compartment so
     a DMM probe can touch the contacts while they are powered.
       
  2. Turn the defogger switch to the half on position, and measure
     the voltage from the connector terminal to the ground lug (on
     the left side of the engine compartment).  One of the connectors
     should read around 12 volts.

     Check the contact drop across the relay by measuring from the defogger
     fuse to the connector terminal.  It should be low, (I measured 
     ~0.35 volts for the 72T defogger relay) and is a low value because 
     a closed relay contact should drop near zero volts.

     This corresponds to measuring the voltage drop across 2-4 in the
     above diagram.

     If this is a high voltage, either the relay is not being activated
     by the defogger switch or is defective.  You may want to remove the 
     relay from the socket and check for corrosion on the relay terminals.

  3. Pull the switch to the full out position, and measure the voltage
     at the other connector terminal.  It should be ~12 volts.  

     Check the contact drop as before.

     This corresponds to measuring the voltage drop across 1-4 in the
     above diagram.
   
  4. If you're not getting 12 volts, check the following:

        1. Corroded defogger fuse contacts
        2. Fatigued defogger fuse contacts
        3. Bad defogger fuse (25A is the installed value)
        4. Corrosion in the defogger relay socket
        5. Corrosion on the defogger relay terminals
        6. Bad defogger relay 
        7. Bad defogger switch
        8. Connector inside engine compartment is corroded.
     
     If the defogger fuse is blown and a new one fails, the
     rear window defogger wiring may be installed incorrectly and
     shorting to chassis.  A body shop that re-installed my Targa
     window did this.
     
     In general, a good fuse or contact should drop near zero volts
     during operation.  So the DMM can be used in volts mode
     to check for unexpected voltage drops across components 
     (fuses, switch contacts, relay contacts, and connectors ) that should
     not drop any significant voltage. 

     Relay activation can be tested by listening for a mechanical click
     as the defogger switch is activated or the relay can be removed
     and the activation voltage read with the DMM from the exposed
     socket.

IV. Power to defogger grid measurement.

  If you want to, you can determine the power developed by your
  defogger grid using the current measuring mode of your DMM.

  Since you have measured the resistance of the elements can calculate
  the power they develop by the formula I^2 * R.

     or

  Calculate the power by 12 * I.

  The current is measured in two stages since many DMM's do not measure 
  greater than 10A.

  The 150Watt element should take 12.5A max
      100watt element should take  8.33 A max

  I'm assuming the 12.5A will not actually occur, both because most
  tested defoggers will be somewhat worn out and/or because the defogger grid
  is stated optimistically.

  1. Remove the 25A defogger fuse in the engine compartment.
     Insert the DMM (in DC current mode) in place of the fuse.

  2. Unplug the dual element defogger and re-insert it such that
     only ONE connector is active.

               O_____O  <-- one half of connector assembly
                \
                 \
                  \ 
                   O    <-- other half of connector assembly

     This is done to avoid overloading the DMM with 
     the combined 12.5A + 8.33A.

  3. Now activate the defogger switch with the DMM
     in DC current mode.  Pull the defogger switch fully out since
     this activates BOTH elements.

     Measure the current.

  4. Now unplug the connector and re-insert to activate the other
     element,  repeat the measurement for the other element.

  The available power is = 12 * sum of current measured.

  It should correspond fairly well with the power calculated
  from V^2/(resistance) measured above.
     
  There WILL be a difference because there is a voltage drop across
  the defogger relay contacts and the DMM leads.

  BE SURE TO TAKE THE DIGITAL MULTIMETER OUT OF CURRENT MODE AFTER THIS
  MEASUREMENT, otherwise you may try to measure volts sometime later 
  and put an effective short circuit across the device under test since
  the DMM is still in current measurement mode.   The DMM appears as 
  a high impedance during voltage measurements but as a low impedance 
  during current measurements.

  Re-connect the defogger connector.

V. Determining bad defogger individual elements assuming the defogger is
   getting 12 volts and everything else is ok.

  DMM IS IN MEASURE VOLTS MODE.

  Power is applied to the defogger for this test.

  The voltmeter negative lead is connected to the ground side of the
  grid (USA passenger side)

  This is assuming the positive end of the defogger is at +12,
  and the ground end is near 0 volts.

  If you want to check that individual elements are working, carefully 
  probe the voltage at the center of the window at each element.  If it is 
  about 6 volts, then the individual element is complete and likely to be
  uniform.  

  It may be uniformly worn, but this will spot opens.  If the voltage at the
  center is 12 volts then there is an open on the ground (earth) half of the
  element.

  Be careful not to scratch the defogger grid and cause an open. You might
  want to use a rounded tip probe to avoid this problem.

  If the voltage at the center is 0 volts then there is an open on the + side
  of the individual grid.  An unstable measurement could be multiple
  opens on either side of the center.

  If the individual element has a SINGLE open, you can use the DMM
  to probe for the open position, since the open will indicate +12v on one
  side and zero on the other side of the open.

  You may be able to repair a small break with conductive paint.

OK, does anybody out there have the definitive answer to the question; What
is the latest 944 motor mount?

JerryT's message this past weekend aroused my curiosity....do the latest
mounts really have springs in them instead of fluid?

I've been gathering what info I can for the past 2 days (still lots of work
to do), and have found this:

 -The 951 375 042 04 mount, which is supposed to be the latest supercession
has been in the Porsche price book for at least a year. 

 -The Euroselect catalog contains a memo describing how the then new "04"
mount has superceded the "05". The "04" has a 4mm thicker flange which
eliminates the need for spacers/washers. This 4mm thicker flange also
contains threaded holes which eliminates the need for bolts AND nuts...just
thread the bolts into the flange.

 -Most of the mounts on the market now are "04"s, but there may be some "05"s
left out there somewhere (are they the ones on "special"?).

The question remains; what about the spring? Is there really a spring inside
the "04" mount? If not, what IS inside an "04"? (I heard somewhere they are
solid).

I'll keep researching, but can anyone else shed some light on this?

I was once sitting in a left turn only lane in Kingman, Arizona when one of 
the county mounties pulled in behind me.  The green arrow came up and I 
proceeded to turn.  Immediately the cop turns on his lights and pulls me 
over.  He walks up and asks if I knew why he was pulling me over.  I had no 
idea.  He then proceeded to tell me I failed to signal my turn.  What 
complete bullsh*t.  I finally managed to talk him down to a warning.  I 
think he was just hassling me because I had out of state plates.
