I don't drive a 914, but this sounds like a broken motor mount.

Does the car make the clunk when you: put on the brakes and attempt to 
let out the clutch?  Can someone watch the engine when you do this test?
If so, have then see if the motor torques over and clunks!

Can you inspect the motor mounts visually?

The way I've tested for broken mounts in (american) cars with automatic
transmissions is to put the sucker in drive, stand on the brakes, and give
it the gas.  When this is done with the hood open you see the motor rotate
about 10 degrees and there is a loud clunk!  Thus, the test suggested above.

Sorry, but that`s not true. You can use unleaded, but every third fill (or fourth, I can't remember just now)  you must use leaded which means basically that you can use it but the engine was not designed to run on it and you will get higher than normal rates of wear in the components that you mentioned. Also the seven series BMW was introduced in '81 or '80 (?), and at this time numerous markets required the car to be able to run on unleaded/or even use a catalysor so the manufacturers were already fitting hardened valve seats (including Porsche). 

The age of cars I was concerned about was prior to, say, '78 when few cars had sufficiently hard valve seats to run completely on unleaded.

My 911 (2.4 `73) shoulnd't use unleaded, you can use unleaded but every third or fourth fill (can't remember)  should be leaded. Basically the engine wasn't designed to use unleaded although the components installed by Porsche were better than most manufacturers of the time (harder/stronger) and so you can use this alternating 2 * unleaded / 1 * leaded  petrol arrangement but the wear IS higher than normal (acceptable?). 

You maybe right about the harder valve guides being fitted, but were hardened valve seats fitted (they sink with unleaded petrol in an engine not designed for it). The valves are also of a different grade metal. Lean burn spark plugs should be fitted and the timing etc changed. The company I mentioned also modify the combustion chambers and ports to improve gas flow so that no performance is lost.

every third tank would accomplish anything, since there's hardly any lead

According to Gene Berg, who has been producing 200 - 500 hp VW engines
for as long as I can remember (at least back into the mid-60's), and who
has done much in the way of debunking rumors by continually testing and
improving his products,

"ALL factory VW air cooled heads from 1967 and later with the hard chromed
stem valves can run unleaded fuels just the way they come from the factory.
ALL VW heads have steel intake seats, hardened steel alloy exhaust seats,
brass guides and tri-metal exhaust valves which have hard chromed stems."

and

"All of the stainless valves I have tested are slightly softer and wear
faster than the factory stock steel unleaded valve."

Generally speaking, technology transfer has gone from Porsche to VW
(the only exception I can think of is electronic fuel injection, which
was available on VWs starting in '68), so I doubt that Porsche would
have continued using soft metal for valve seats in the post 356 era.

I am a young graduate student looking to buy a fun car before I become
bogged down with real responcibilities.  I think that the 911 is a
beautifull looking car and that the six under the trunk does a good job
moving the body.  However, I don't know much else about the car with
respect to the best engine to look for, best year (I can afford), and so
on.  Can somebody out there tell me why I should or should not buy one
or these beauties.  Any information will be of help.  
I drove one and loved every minute of it.

I'm embarrassed (but quite relieved) to say that it was only a loose
piece of heater hardware (right side valve & attached elbow) banging
against the engine mounting bar.  I discovered this when I crawled
under to examine the engine mounts.  I also discovered that my ideas
about how the engine is mounted were totally wrong.  I now know lots
more about how it's mounted...

Thanks for bearing with me... and thanks for all the advice...

Excerpt from Porsche magazine, March/April 1987, "A Bit About Gas", by Bruce
Anderson, page 47.

"...
Really soft seats are made of cast iron with a hardness range of Rockwell 12
to 25.  Seats with a Rockwell hardness of 45 to 50 are probably hard enough,
in most cases, to provide satisfactory protection.
	We have hardness tested the exhaust seats used in a number of
different Porsche cylinder heads.  We checked the following heads with the
results shown:

	1) 1966 911 head RA 65
	2) 1969 911 head RA 54
	3) 1976 911 head RA 64
	4) 1.8 914 head RA 59
	5) 1.7 914 head RA 44
	6) 1962 356 head RA 64
	7) 356C/912 head RA 58

	None of these seats can be considered "soft" seats and should not have
problems with unleaded gasoline.  Additionally, all of the Porsche engines
built since 1964 have some form of valve rotators.  Their favorite is to use
the ATE style keepers which do not hold the valve tightly, so that the valve
is free to rotate. ... As a result, we should be able to use unleaded gasoline
without additional changes.  However, the best way to keep track of what is
happening, until you are sure, is to make more frequent checks of the valve
clearances.

This article is way too long to include the whole thing.

         REPEAL OF THE 55/65 MPH NATIONAL MAXIMUM SPEED LIMIT


     The National Motorists Association (NMA) is undertaking a
     massive campaign to get the federal government out of the
     business of setting specific speed limits by calling for the
     return of speed zoning authority to the states where it
     belongs.  This would mean no more FEDERAL restrictions on
     the types and locations of roads that must be capped with
     speed limits of 55 or 65 mph.

     Unless the states have the flexibility to set highway speed
     limits in a consistent manner reflecting the consensus
     speeds driven by a state's motorists, those motorists will
     continue to be subjected to unjustified ticket fines,
     insurance surcharges and higher insurance premiums.  The
     intended meaning and value of speed limits will also
     continue to suffer.

     NOW is the time to act since Congress is working to
     reauthorize surface transportation legislation and the 55/65
     mph issue is part of Senate and House deliberations.
     Unfortunately, nothing significant is expected to change
     unless a broad base of "grassroots" support is generated for
     eliminating federal restrictions on maximum speed limits.

     This is where you come in.  You must write your
     congressional Representative and both your U.S. Senators
     requesting that they work to give the states the flexibility
     to set all speed limits rationally, without restrictions and
     artificial caps on maximum highway speeds.  In fact, that's
     all you have to say unless you want to say more about the
     problems you see with the 55 mph limit.

     That's right, it's as simple as that and you don't need to
     write a formal letter -- a note, typed or handwritten, is
     just fine.  If you prefer the phone, use it instead of
     writing (leaving a message is fine).  Just be sure to take
     those few minutes to tell your elected representatives in
     Washington what you want them to do.  This campaign will be
     a great success if you act now and prove to legislators that
     there is constituent support for giving the states the
     flexibility to set highway speed limits.

     If you don't know the names of your House representative or
     two U.S. Senators, a call to your local library or post
     office can help.  The addresses are as follows:

     The Honorable ...               The Honorable ...
     U.S. Senate                     U.S. House of Representatives
     Washington, DC  20510           Washington, DC  20515

     Senate Operator                 House Operator
     202-224-3121                    202-224-6515

     If you live in a state that has gone to a 65 mph speed limit
     on federally eligible roads, this campaign is still
     important for there are many roads still at the 55 limit
     that could stand to be higher.  If you live in one of the
     "holdout" states in the northeast that resists higher
     limits, this campaign is critical to forcing changes in
     those states.

     A return to more reasonable speed zoning by the states will
     result in smoother and safer travel on many more roads and
     highways and much less fear of getting an unjustified
     speeding ticket.  The alternative is another five years of
     55 and its never-ending problems.

     In addition to contacting your federal legislators, you can
     also help the campaign by sharing this message with others.

Scott, 

I bought my 911 (1980 coupe) about 16 months ago.  I researched and looked
for the car for about the same lenght of time.

My "humble" opinions...

2.0 liter cars (1965-1967?)  reliable, spartan interior. (I'm not sure when

2.2 liter cars (1967?-1971)  as above, larger engine      the 2.2 came out)

2.4 liter cars (1972,73)     911t was first CIS FI, others were full mechanical

2.7 liter cars (1974-1977)   Watch out.  I'd stay away from these.  The '74
is probably ok, particularly if the cylinder rods have the reinforcing inserts
in the case.  Having the case shuffle pinned is also a good idea.  The '75-'77
cars have the more plush interior, but also run very hot, have smog pumps, and
are generally low reliability.

3.0 liter cars (1978-1983)   Wonderful.  These engines last 200k w/o any major 
work.  The '78 has bad inner valve springs and a '79 may or may not have the
bad springs.  The rubber centered clutches tend to fail ('78-'83?).  The '80
-83' has the oxygen sensor FI and does not have a smog pump.

3.2 liters cars (1984-??)    First all digital FI.  More power than 3.0's

Things to watch for...

Cam chain tensioners.  These guys fail.  The fix is to install the pressure 
fed tensioners from the '84's.  I just bought the kit (from Imparts) and it
ran about $400 (with new chain ramps an wheel spacers).  There is also a collar
that can be installed to prevent complete collapse.  ONE OF THESE MODS IS 
ESSENTIAL FOR A PRE '84 CAR!!!

Regarding a car for a grad student, I don't know your financial state, but 
there is NO WAY I could have afforded my car when I was a grad student.

Depending on how much you can afford, I would go with an early car, i.e. up to
'73, or a later car, i.e. '78 or later.

You can probably find an early car for about $6k-$8k, cheaper cars won't 
(usually) be worth buying.  A 911S will be significantly more, and will be
quite likely to have had a hard life.

An SC ('78 on) will run from $12k-$25k.  On the other hand, maintenance will
be lower.

If you are really serious about this, buy the  "911 Performance Handbook" by
Bruce Anderson.  Anderson is the national technical chairman for the PCA
(Porsche Club of America).  Read it cover to cover.

Have you considered an 912 or 914?  There are times when I wish I had bought
a 914, particularly when I start thinking about time trials, and the cost
of sheet metal repairs to a 911.

Remember, the older cars need more work.  If you are not doing the work your-
self, it can be very expensive, in fact, it is expensive if you are doing it
yourself.  An example:  I bought the factory workshop manual at the Carlsen
swap meet yesterday.  It cost $150.  The list price is $400.  Of course, it
is six binders that takes up about 14 inches on a bookcase.  We don't even
want to DISCUSS the cost of engine rebuilding.

One last thing.  Under no circumstances buy ANY porsche without having a 
mechanic look it over.  The cost is usually about $100.  I had four cars
evaluated during my search.  On the first three, $100 was cheap to avoid
what I would have otherwise spent.

Subject: 66 911 Brakes, Shocks

I've had this car for 14 years now, and it feels like an old
friend.  However, as Road and Track magazine put it some years
ago, it is getting somewhat long in tooth.  The brakes need
attention, and I'm not satisfied with the shocks that are
available for it nowadays.

WRT brakes: apparently one of the pistons (in the calipers)
is not self-adjusting itself.  The symptom is that when the brakes
are applied the pedal movement is X; if the pedal is released
and the brakes re-applied within a few seconds the pedal
movement is .5X and the brakes *feel* stronger.  If you wait
longer than a few seconds, the pedal movement returns to X.
I've had the master cylinder replaced with no change.  My
theory is that one of the pistons won't self adjust out to
compensate for pad/disc wear, and thus has farther to travel
when the brakes are applied; once it has been pushed out it
returns slowly, which accounts for the .5X pedal movement.
Does anybody out there have alternative suggestions as to what
the problem might be, and/or suggestions on how to determine
which piston is the sticky one?

WET shocks: the shocks that are now available for the (front)
non-Koni shock towers are pretty poor nowadays, and I think
the selection will only get poorer.  The only option I've thought
of is to get Koni towers and shocks, assuming they are available
for that year.  If they aren't I might have to upgrade to a later
model tower, which brings up the possibilty of having to change
suspension parts since the tread was widened around 1968.  Any
other thoughts?

Thanks

Rod -

Regarding your brakes, your description is symptomatic of seriously deteriorated
rubber brake hoses.  This deterioration is very typical on a car as it gets as
old as yours has, and is easily corrected by replacing those babies - sooner
rather than later, please!  Get a fresh set of OEM rubber hoses, and get the
system properly bled as well.  If you have not already done so, check the rotors
for useable width and overall condition while you're at it.  (Btw, would also be
symptomatic of a failing/ed vacuum booster, except you don't have one!)

Automotion quotes the OEM part nos. as:

  front: 901.355.632.01 @ $13.95 (each - you need two)
   rear: 695.352.631.00 @ $15.95 (ditto)

You might want to double-check with a dealer.

A quick check of the usual catalogs reveals the following shock choices. 
Imparts has Boge Turbo TS shocks at $65 a corner.  OK, maybe Boge isn't
synonymous with go-fast, but it is original and if your *really* want to tear up
the tarmac, you will probably want to seriously upgrade your car as you
mentioned!  1-800-325-9043.

Automotion has both Koni and Sachs shock appplications which will, apparently,
fit your Boge struts.  The Koni's fronts are item KO-1394, $294 a pair, rears
are KO-1738 at $198 the pair.  The Sachs' fronts are SA-536002, $163 and rears
are SA-101047, $230 the pair.  1-800-777-8881.  Tweaks also carries the Koni and
Boge parts under different part numbers, cheaper prices than Automotion. 
1-800-782-9231.

	Steve -

	I've run both, and they're both great.
I wouldn't want to choose one over the other.

	Yes, Road America is faster - many clubs slow down the course
by adding turns, which can introduce chicanes where there isn't run-off 
for error (Beware!).  Also, Road Atlanta has many blind curves - Road 
America does not.  There is one blind and one obscured turn at 
Road America, and they're not as dangerous as the ones at Road Atlanta 
(espec. #11, thru the bridge, at the end of the back straight!).
	
	Otherwise, the two tracks are similar: there is lots of 
runoff room for error, great terrain, beautiful scenery, great 
viewing angles (teriffic spectator's courses).

	have fun!

If you have a 66 911, I would like to recommend as strongly as
possible that you try to keep in original.  Even though you may be
sacrificing a little performance by not changing the struts or
whatever, these cars are worth a lot more in original condition.

The brake problem you describe sounds like a pretty standard
description of air in the brake system.  If your brakes get stiffer
after "pumping" the pedal, this is a typical sign that the brakes need
to be bled.  Worn brake lines will cause this to a lesser degree, they
are assiciated more with a very "spongy" pedal, that is the brakes
never seem to be stiff.  I would recommend you bleed your brakes and
check every component.  Any home auto repair guide will describe the
procedure.  If you suspect a pistion is frozen, check with the pads
out that you can retract the piston (with a channel lock or c clamp or
something soft).  If the pistion can move at all, and there's no fluid
leak, chances are good the piston is OK.  The only way to really check
is to rebuild the caliper.

have a '65' 912 that I am dying to restore, and may like to ask you
questions about what you've had to do to yours since we have the
same bodies.  

As to the brakes, pull the calipers off, 1 by one, get a big pair 
of pliers and a thin peice of wood to protect the piston.  squeze
in a piston, it should go easily.  Then do the second piston of
the same caliper, it should go about the same.   If not, there's the
problem.  Check all four wheels, and while you are at it, change the
pads.  I do not beleive your theory by the way, because the calipers
are not floating. Both pistons adjust the same way in each caliper,
basically the disk pushes the pads until there is no more force, and
the fliud is being vented to the reservoir via the master cylinder.  
New fluid should also fill in throught this vent as the pads wear
thinner and more fluid is needed to push the pistons.  I am 
wondering if the x, .5x effect is not that in the time between pumps,
the pistons do not fully retract and then the next step is accomplished
with more fluid in the lines due to opening the vent.  Also, if you
do this inspection, 1)  change your pads, 2) check your wheel bearings,
disk wobble can cause your problems 3) check disk warp.  Don't worry
about circumferencial groves, just warp, you'll feel warp, and it will
afect your braking, but circular groves wont bother you at all,
a friend prefers it for racing.

All Kevin's advice is right on - I would add that you probably will
see the brake system deteriorate incrementally soon so redoing the whole
thing at once might be a good plan. At any rate, if you flush or bleed
the system be sure to use the same type of brake fluid used in the past. If you switch to the newer DOT5 fluid or a different type, seals in a marginal state
will probably fail. If you rebuild the entire system, use the later fluid -
it is much better at expunging moisture and not gassing under high heat.

In this weeks' Autoweek AJR has stainless brake hoses for around $80 a set,
all models. If you want a hard pedal, these are the only way to go.
I have also noticed good prices on perfomance struts and 
brakes from AJR from time to time. - [I have never bought from them]

Subject: Cam chain question  (and re.66 911)
To: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu


Hi everyone,

I've got a question for people, especially you Chris W.:

Do you need to replace the cam chain when upgrading the tensioners?

My tensioners have not failed ('80 911sc), but after the tensioner thread
about 2 weeks ago, I decided it was time to upgrade.

In addition to the tensioner kit, am planning to replace the chain ramps and
the wheel spacers.  I have heard that if a tensioner does collapse, it is best
to replace the chain.  As far as I know, nothing has collapsed and everything
is working correctly.

This brings up another question, cam chains are available both with and without
master links.  As I understand it, one uses a masterlinked chain when one does
not have the engine completly disassembled, i.e. when upgrading the tensioners.
I am a little leery of putting a master link in there...

Any comments?

p.s.
regarding Rod Millers '66 911 brake and shock question, Koni makes shocks for
Boge struts, but not for Bilstein struts.  I don't know if Bilsteins were used
in '66 or not.  They were in '80 'cause thats what I've got!  So a non-koni
strut is not necessarilly a Boge strut, unless, of course, that's all there
was in '66!  Red struts are usually koni, black are usually boge, and green 
are usually bilstein.  Be sure TO CLEAN THE DIRT OFF FIRST before attempting
to determine the strut color, they all look black at first...

By the way, I have been very happy with the Bilsteins shocks I am using.  I 
have heard two things about koni's.  One, from the mechanics I used to work
for: "Koni's dont seem to EVER wear out."  The application here is a '59 
XK150 jag, probably not mcphearson strut.  The other, from a true car nut 
at work: "the Koni's I used in my datsun (mcphearson strut!) leaked within 
3 years.  He disassembled the shock and found that the top oil seal was also 
used as a bushing, thus the early failure.  I have no idea if this has been 
corrected or not.

Also, Imparts [(800) 325-9043] has braided steel hoses for $46.  They pay
shipping on anything over $45.

My tensioner kit (from imparts) with new wheel spacers and chain ramps ran 
just over $400.  The kit alone is $359.  I did see it somewhere else in 
Panorama for $335 tho' (yes, after I'd already ordered it).  Time from order
to arrival was about 1 week, 3-5 working days, I don't quite remember.

So far, Imparts has beaten Automotion on everything I have priced.  The 
service is better at automotion though, they know what car I drive, keep the
credit card # on file, etc.

Oh yes, the automotion sale is this weekend, phone only and 20% off everything.
I don't have their number handy, but they are in santa clara, CA. 408 area
code if anyone is interested.

I have a 1966 (or 65) 912 that has a running engine, but pours 
smoke into the pasenger area via holes in the exhaust/rockers.
Is there a tube or duct or something I can disconnect and cap
so that for the time I can run the engine without getting too
much in the car.  Ofcourse I know that the car can't be driven
until I fix the exchanger (I will put straight pipes in for now),
but I wish to minimize the mess for now.  Also, any warnings
in removing these exchangers for straight pipes?

Must be the season for brake work. I'm going to put in a plug for one
of the best tools I have: a simple, straightforward piston rectractor,
made by Girling (the British brake people). I bought mine through
Pegasus Racing Supplies, 414-782-0880. It looks almost, but not
entirely, unlike a small hand ax; the "blade" part is tapered to slide
into the space between disk and piston, after which you just twist on
the handle to push the piston back. Works like a charm on all the cars
I've tried, and is much easier and safer than pliers or C-clamps or a
screwdriver or any of the other improvised methods I've used. Check it out.

Subject: Cam chain question  (and re.66 911)


   Do you need to replace the cam chain when upgrading the tensioners?

You don't, usually.  There isn't as much force on that chain as on,
say, a motorcycle chain, so it doesn't need to be changed that often.
This, of course, depends on how hard you drive the car.  I know of
chains that have lasted over 200Kmis, and some that have lasted about
20 (this was using the solid tensioner).  With pressure-fed or the
hydraulic tensioners, you should see about 100Kmis *at least*.  To
tell if you need new chains, check out the piston on the tensioner.
If it looks like it's near the end of its travel, then the chain is
stretched and probably should be replaced.

   My tensioners have not failed ('80 911sc), but after the tensioner
   thread about 2 weeks ago, I decided it was time to upgrade.

Good idea.

   In addition to the tensioner kit, am planning to replace the chain
   ramps and the wheel spacers.  I have heard that if a tensioner does
   collapse, it is best to replace the chain.  As far as I know,
   nothing has collapsed and everything is working correctly.

Remember that the brown one goes on the lower right side.  The lower
ones are a *real* bitch, but do it anyway.  You only need to replace
the chain if it has been damaged or stretched.  A failed tensioner can
cause damage, but you are right that with no failures you're probably
OK.  Again, just check the travel on the tenioner piston.

   This brings up another question, cam chains are available both with
   and without master links.  As I understand it, one uses a
   masterlinked chain when one does not have the engine completly
   disassembled, i.e. when upgrading the tensioners.  I am a little
   leery of putting a master link in there...

If you do replace the chain, you have to retime the cams.  I described
before how to do the gross timing, which is all that is necessary if
you don't change the chains (and isn't necessary at all if you don't
let the chain skip), but if you do change the chains you have to get
the tools to do the exact timing.

The master link chains are fine, we've run them on cars that are
tracked, and they hold up just fine.

Subject: 914 wheel width

This is the sort of question to which the answer must be well known - but not
to me.

What is the widest wheel I can put on my 914?  I don't care if they're
different front and rear.

Let's figure a few scenarios:
        (1) Stock fenders, without fender modifications.
        (2) Stock fenders, but willing to bend them a bit.
        (3) 914/6 GT fender flares.

Also, I probably want to stick with 15" rims, either 205/50-15 or 225/50-15
tires.  It looks like there's tons of room under the front fenders, and I
might be willing to believe that I could squeeze 225's under the rear
fenders.  Can I go with 205's on 8" rims?  7" rims?  225's on 8" rims?
Maybe even a 245/45-16 on 9" rims, with the GT flares?

Thanks for your help...

Mark

 Mark -

 I'm still trying to figure this one out for myself.
 Let me know what sort of answers you get.

 I'm planning on going to 16" wheels (just because
 so many Porsche 911 owners discard their sixes and
 sevens for wider rims). This means that I can
 by 6x17 and 7x17s for my car for very cheap (like
 $100-125 per wheel). 

 Big problem is the offset. I don't know what offset
 to run (other than the spacing on Carrera 2 wheels
 doesn't work). The _interior_ clearance (the inner
 edge of the wheel and tire) will be your limiting
 factor not the fender.

 You can flatten the interior lip in the wheel well or have
 a body shop remove it. That will gain you some 
 space at the expense of strength. Note that if you
 pull out the fenders (without adding material) the
 gap between the lower rear edge of the door and the
 rear quarter panel will grow in an unsightly manner.

 Finally, you can add flares to the fenders (use
 metal, fibreglass sucks) but this will also compromise
 the strength of the body panel because you will be
 removing the stamping around the lip of the wheel 
 well that gives it some structural rigidity.

 I've investigated leading rather than using that 
 Bondo crap but unfortunately it seems like it would
 ruin the body sheetmetal (which is too thin to withstand
 the heat of the torch melting the lead). 

 If anyone has a concrete answer as to what offset
 is desirable to fit 16" wheels under a 914 rear fender
 please speak up..

 thanks,
 Stefan

	I vaguely remember reading in the past that it is possible to
decipher the "options" listed on the sticker beside the spare wheel
on a 944.

	Where do you get the list of options - or alternatively can anyone
tell me what any/all of these mean :

C16 C(G?)50 I00 441 650 651 657 666 990

	Other numbers there include "Eng Code / Trans Code  07 5Y" and
"Paint No / Interior  L041 / L041    xx".

	There seems to be a bewildering array of stickers with numbers on
them under the bonnet (hood). Apart from the VIN/Engine/Chassis
number, there are quite a few with an "E" followed by a 1 or 2 digit
number in a circle followed by a longer number. Examples are "(E4)
21R 01 84001" or "(E2) 15R-04 Annexe 9-84.072". Do these actually
mean anything?

	Another sticker says "NTA PRIMARY MAC NO 0430103V".

	Last question : How can you tell if a 944 has a limited slip diff?
I'm looking for a visual inspection answer rather than "trying the
car out with one wheel on gravel and the other on tarmac" - I don't
think my driving skills can cope with that one!

	Many thanks to all the folks who have helped me in the past when
I've posted to this list - there are very few Porsche drivers around
here to swap notes with, and the local branch of the Porsche Club of
Great Britain is inactive.

Philip -

These option codes may be found in a PCNA Fact Book for the year of your car's
manufacture.  The numbers don't change from year to year, but available options
do.  My '87 book lists the following from your codes:

  650 - electric sunroof
  666 - delete cosmoline protection
  990 - all cloth seats

> Other numbers there include "Eng Code / Trans Code  07 5Y" and
> "Paint No / Interior  L041 / L041    xx".

L041 means a black exterior, and I would assume a black interior.  These paint
codes are listed in section 66 of the workshop manual.

The 07 denotes engine code M 44/07, a manual engine.  There are in fact four
different codes denoting manuals and four denoting automatics in the
eight-valave aspiros through MY 88.  I have no record of the differences among
those engine codes.

The 5Y identification code denotes the 5-speed transmission without limited slip
installed in ROW ("rest of the world") cars from MY 85/2 through 88, known in
full as type 016 J, id code 5Y.  If you had limited slip, it would be code 5Z.

No idea, never seen 'em on a US car.  I think the last one means your car has
nuclear first-strike capability.

You know the answer.  You can also read the seven-character code off the top of
the read transmission housing (use a mirror!) and decipher it.

Sounds like you're the right guy to make it active!  Someone has to get the ball
rolling.  In my PCA region, we have about 850 members, of whom very
optimistically 200 are active in one activity or another.  We get anywhere from
twenty to sixty folks at a meeting, depending on speaker, weather, and location.
This is about average for a region our size.

If you are interested, I can try to find out whether anyone has ever written up
thoughts on how to get an inactive chapter active and mail them to you.

Subject: Muffler trouble on my '75 914

There seems to be some trouble fitting my muffler to the exhaust manifolds
on my '75 914 2.0.

The car is not currently fitted with a catalytic converter, but needs to be to
pass smog requirements here in CA.  The problem is that the exhaust system
that fits a cat has two single pipes going up to the manifolds.  But my
manifolds have two _double_ pipes.  The only exhaust systems we can find
to fit that do not support catalytic converters.

Is there any exhaust system with a catalytic converter that fits
these double pipes?  If so, where can I find them?

If not, can I just replace the double pipe manifolds with single pipe manifolds?
Where I can get the manifolds at?

Also, why is there this compatibility problem?  My guess is that I got
a '75 914 body and a '74 or older engine.  When did they start requiring
cats on CA 914s?  Or even better when did they switch from the double
pipe manifolds to the single pipe?

Thanx all.  I'm dazed and confused, and I just want my cool car back on
the road!

Here is a summary that Stan Hanks sent to me a while ago.


>let's see: we got CA  vs.  49 state cars in '75, and the CA cars had 
>thermal reactors and everyone had air pumps. We went back to a 50  state
>engine in '77, again  with thermal reactors and air pumps all around.
>And in '78 with the 911SC, we got catalytic converters on all cars, 
>and the CA cars got an EGR system as well.

Hope that helps.

Actually, the PRIMARY MAC is what gets returned if you ARP that car.

I got the latest from Bob Russo last night *Cheif Instructor for the
event).

Apparently a green student and instructor were in turn 5.  They turned
in quite early after a pass, early apexed, and earlt track-outed,
dropped a wheel, bounced off the guard rail past the turtles (this is
past the turn) spun across the track and hit the right side guard rail
with the resar end/passenger door/front end.

The roof had to be cut off the car.  The instructor was medivaced and it
was pretty dicey for him for a week or so.  6 broken ribs, bruises and
apparently a mild stroke occurred while he was waiting to be cut out
(head slumped over and cut off circulation).  He is recovering well and
has a very mild loss of use of his right are which thay expect physical
therapy will solve.  The student had some bruises and severely strained
neck muscles.  

Both are expected to fully recover.

One note:  Although the vehicle was equipped with 5pt harnesses, neither
the instructor or the driver was wearing them.  The student was female
with this being her first or second event, the instructor has been
instructing with Reisentoter for several years.

This is about all that is to be known as far as I know.

Hi All

There is an interesting letter in the Tech Q&A of this month's Pano.
It concerns a 1980 3.0 SC in which a couple of pistons were seriously
lunched (piston grooves broken apart).  In his answer Bruce Anderson
attributes the problem to detonation and hints that he's seen this
problem before in the 3.0 engine.  I'm curious.  Is this a known failure
mode?  It seems to me that the kind of detonation that would produce
mechanical failure of that magnitude would be plenty loud to hear.  Has
anyone any additional info on this?  (As a 1980 3.0 SC owner it strikes
pretty close to home :-).  

In addition, the concept was mentioned that poor injector O-rings would
induce detonation - why - leaned-out mixture perhaps?  Should these be
replaced after 10 years?  It there an insidious sub-aural detonation
thing that can go on?

By the way, B.A. was kind of (uncharacteristically) vague in his answer, 
detonation being his "best guess" as I remember it.  Anyone got any
other additional info?

Thanks...
Bruce

Subject: Clogged vacuum connection on MFI throttle body

...is exactly what I have.  One body is vacuuming and the other is not.  There
is a brass fixture seemingly cast into the plastic throttle body, and does not
appear to be removable.  The hole is slightly larger than a pin...  Does
anyone have any advice on how to unclog this thing?  It keeps my 911 from
achieving proper advance at idle, the main result being backfiring and
reversion.

  About the detonating 911SC - a leaky fuel injector seal would cause
detonation under heavy load, or when the engine is very hot.  My old 914 had
the carburetor manifold come loose resulting in a pesky hole in a piston, all
caused by detonation.  As I recall, 914 fuel injector seals have a bad habit
of leaking also - the injector is more or less kept pushed into the port...
not a very good system in my opinion.

Bruce -

I am no expert in these matters.  Hopefully Chris Welty will chip in, eh?

Yes, leaking injector seals will let unmetered air into the system, causing the
mixture to lean out and detonate.  The air is called "unmetered" because it
enters surreptitiously (so to speak) past the air volume or air mass sensor
(depending on the induction system).  As such, the FI system cannot account for
it in deciding how much gas to allow to flow.

Knocking is not always an obvious noise to the untrained ear, and even the
trained ear can miss it at high revs or when there is a lot of ambient noise
(stereo, SO or children shreiking, sirens...).

Bruce, like everyone else, diagnoses largely based on prior experience.  If he
hasn't seen this kind of problem much, I can understand his equivocation,
especially trying to diagnose at a distance!

Little bit of an update.  The student, Mary Beth, is out of the hospital and
fine.  She has a neck cuff or brace to wear for a while.  The instructor, Dale,
is out of the ICU and is also doing fine.  This was as of Parade week, when I
spoke with Marlys Thovson re: Dale.

Well, Stan the Answer Man happens to have that price info on tap...

That '80 Targa was a $29150 item new, plus options. Right now, except
for specialty items, the turn-around point (per the NADA blue book)
seems to be about '77, where the original price for an 'S Targa was
$15945 and the current average retail is about $15500. All of the
older models  seem to have the current average price exceed the original
price.

However, if you had  put that same money in the right stocks, in T-bills or
even in plain old passbook savings, you'd be much better off. Except
then you  wouldn't have a 911.  8{)

The PCNA guys used to run ads claiming that 911s performed about as
well as investments as anything else. Excellence magazine examined that
in one of the early issues, and found that when you added in the cost of
*using* the car like maintenence and what, that the claim was not true.
I have a great deal of trouble with people who  view these cars as 
investments. If it's not a passion and a way of life, I get real 
intolerant in a hurry....

Subject: Re:  3.0SC detonation

Funny that should come up. I was talking with my mechanic today
about what I needed to do to prepare for an as-yet-unannounced Lone
Star Region event at the newly re-opened Texas World Speedway in late
September. (plug, plug...)

He mentioned the same article, and we discussed it. It seems that this
is a well-known problem and that Bruce just wasn't plugged in all the
way  or had sniffed too much brake fluid or something. The real problem
isn't the o-ring on the injector body, it's the *other* seal on the
injector assembly. Remember: phenolic body  gizmo bolts to engine, 
injector  slips inside. Two seals: one on injector, one on phenolic  body
gizmo. (As an aside, on the 914 issue: same kind of arrangement where 
there's one little seal on the injector tip and one big seal on the
body where the clamp goes.  replace  both at the same time on the 914).

The 3 &  6  cylinders are furtherst from the air flow, so overheat and
die. Just like on VWs, except there it's usually just the #3.

Anyway, this happens down here all the time. And, apparently, if you run
with your CO set to 2.5% or higher, even if the seal leaks a little it
won't matter enough to pop the pistons.  

If you want more info on this straight from the horses  mouth, call Sam
Shalala at ProTechnik  713.879.8861 and tell him I said he could set
you straight.

Subject: 3.0SC detonation


   There is an interesting letter in the Tech Q&A of this month's Pano.
   It concerns a 1980 3.0 SC in which a couple of pistons were seriously
   lunched (piston grooves broken apart).  In his answer Bruce Anderson
   attributes the problem to detonation and hints that he's seen this
   problem before in the 3.0 engine.  I'm curious.  Is this a known failure
   mode?  It seems to me that the kind of detonation that would produce
   mechanical failure of that magnitude would be plenty loud to hear.  Has
   anyone any additional info on this?  (As a 1980 3.0 SC owner it strikes
   pretty close to home :-).  


I read the lette and response, and, though it's not right in front of
me, I don't think Bruce was talking about this being a problem in 3.0
SCs in particular.  Detonation is a problem that could affect any car.
Detonation basically means that there is combustion in a cylinder at
the wrong time. The most dangerous detonation occurs while the piston
in on the compression stroke.  At any other time there is a valve open
and the force of the explosion will blow out the opening.

The most common cause of detonation is really bad timing, either
completely off or a broken advance.  A lean mixture is also a fairly
common cause of detonation.

If the mixture is lean in a particular cylinder, then that cylinder
will be significantly hotter than the others.  This can, if it gets
hot enough, cause premature combustion during the compression stroke,
since the cylidner is much hotter than it was designed to be.  SO
you've got the momentum of the car pushing the piston down, and the
explosion pushing it up.  This can be fatal to bearings, and most
especially to the rings, since it is the rings which seal the chamber.
Sometimes this can actually punch holes in the pistion, though I've
only ever heard of that with cast pistons and SCs run with forged.

Lean mixture, as mentioned by others, is caused by unmetered air
entring any fuel delivery system (carb or FI).  In carbs, unmetered
air is anything that enters below the venturi, in a FI system, its
anywhere past the airflow sensor.  There are abundant places for leaks
in FI systems, and the injectors are only one of them.  However, Stan
is absulutely correct that in air-cooled cars the cylinders that are
farthest from the fan run hotter, and this usually reduces the life of
various parts that contact them, and adds to the heat problem when
they start to run lean.  The fact that this means #3 and #6 in a 911
further supports BA's analysis of the original problem, I'd be
inclined to distrust the local mechanic's reports.

In any car, you should check all the seals in the FI.  BOth injector
seals, all the boots, everything.  Unmetered air in the whole system
isn't quite as bad as in one or two, since the O2 sensor will
detect the problem and increase the mixture.  Running the car very
rich will also help prevent damage, though it's more of a workaround
than an actual fix (of course, I don't live in the desert, either).



   In addition, the concept was mentioned that poor injector O-rings would
   induce detonation - why - leaned-out mixture perhaps?  Should these be
   replaced after 10 years?  It there an insidious sub-aural detonation
   thing that can go on?


You can't really hear detonation unless you use a stethoscope.  It is
happening inside the case, with the valves closed.  You can definitely
feel it, if you are tuned to your car.  I know I can tell when one
cylinder isn't firing, and with detonation it should feel like an even
more drastic loss of power and the engine should be running very
rough.  

   By the way, B.A. was kind of (uncharacteristically) vague in his answer, 
   detonation being his "best guess" as I remember it.  Anyone got any
   other additional info?

Well, from the pictures Iwould have agreed with BA that the problem
looked like detonation, and again from the fact it was #3 and #6 would
support the particualr causes described here.  But the local mechanic
had said it wasn't the problem, so that's why Bruce was being more vague.


Hope this helps.

CONDITION: NEW, unused, in original box

REASON: Bought for SoloII 914, but can't use since switching
        the half shafts is not legal in the classification

SALES PITCH: This is the ULTIMATE in limited slip differentials.
             There are NO clutch plates to wear out, Quaife claim
             they have only had two returned in the history of the
             company, only one of them was faulty and it was due to
             external catastrophic axle failure! They are made
             by skilled British craftsmen (in the Rolls Royce

I haven't seen the 911 arrangement, so I can't comment on that, but as I
recall, 914's use an identical mount to VW's, which I do know a bit
about.  The large "seal", which fits into the phenolic plate doesn't do
any sealing.  It centers the injector, and transmits the force of the
mounting clamp to the tip seal, which does all the sealing.  The tip seal
should be replaced frequently, since it hardens and cracks when subjected 
to hight temps.  There is no need to replace the large seal, unless it loses 
its resiliency.

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL8]

Over on rec.autos.tech, a lengthy discussion of K&N reusable air
filters seems to be winding down.  From what I can tell, this is a
reasonably inexpensive oil bath filter which may save money in the
long run (through its reusability) and may (or may not) improve gas
milage, improve performance, and screw up fuel injection.

So, has anyone used one on a 914 2.0 (or similar) ?

Do they make one for this car?  Will a less restrictive air filter
screw up the fuel injection?  I'd think not, because the metering is
done on the engine-side of the filter, rather than the world-side, but
then again, what do I know?

that I replace the timing belt as preventative maintenance (at a cost of
$250), because it is weak spot in the 944/951 engine and the repair cost is

are there stronger, more durable belts available than the original equipment

Replacement of the timing belt on all 944 series at 30,000 mile
intervals is an absolute must!

It should also be retensioned every 15,000 miles, though on 88+ 944s,
this is a relatively simple matter.

If it breaks, you will be in for a set of valves at the very least.  Not
something good to mess with.

This operation (on later cars) does not require the tensioner tool as a
self tensioning mechanism was included (according to our tech chair,
though I have never seen it personally).

Corky,

>From EVERYTHING I've heard, you basically have two choices:  replace the
timing belt every 30k, or replace the engine every 40k! (I suspect this 
is a slight exageration)

I do not own a 944/51 (a WATER cooled porsche?), so my knowledge is some-
what second hand, but I think it would be $250 well spent.

With the 911, the factory parts are normally the best available.  I would 
have thought this to be true of all porsches, until I heard about the 
PLASTIC radiator in the 944/51.

In spite of an unkind suspicion that the 944/51 timing belt problem was 
engineered by the factory to give us 911 owners a nice warm feeling (while
we worry about out cam chain tensioners...), I would be very careful about
installing a non-factory belt.  With the factory belt you know you need to 
replace it every 30k (you might consider learning to do it yourself).  With
an aftermarket belt, the only thing you know for sure is that if it does 
fail, you roach your engine.

Anyway, best of luck.

  The rev limiter (never heard another name for it...) is built into the
distributor rotor.  You would probably find out more about it under the
electrical section.  As I recall, it comes in 3 different RPM setting - mine
happens to be 7300.  I keep a cheap non-limiting rotor as a spare, but would
not use it on a permanent basis in the car, particularly for a beginning 911
driver - I hit the limit 2 or 3 times when I was getting used to the car.
914's also have a similar item, set at around 5500 or so.

The rev limiter is part of the ignition, the distributor, on the non

Hi all...

Thanks to everyone who responded regarding the detonation question.  I
would like to continue the discussion just a bit.  I have heard detonation
(preignition, knocking) a fair amount in various vehicles and it usually
is noticible under load as long as the radio isn't blasting etc.  Stan 
(I think) though said something about hearing it with a stethoscope.  I 
sure wouldn't want to be fooling around with a stethescope under the 
conditions under which _I_ think detonation usually occurs.  Common 
wisdom (although I don't personally agree necessarily) in a water cooled
car is that occasional detonation under heavy load is not damaging if
is doesn't last too long.  

I guess I'm just amazed that anyone (who drives a Porsche :-) ) could
miss the kind of detonation that would be required to damage engine parts
internally.  I guess one could just not realize what was going on.  My
real worry is that I could be slightly leaned out under load and 
heating up cylinders on a hot day and not really know it (and that 
I wouldn't hear or notice anything).  Is oil temperature a reliable 
indicator of overall engine temperature?  I've run in some fairly hot
weather around here but not really hard.  I have heard about all the
auxiliary oil cooling stuff one can do, is this necessary if you're not
really running hard in the desert (is it necessary if you are)?  Someone
mentioned VW's and although I have never been a big vee dub fan (I did
own a bus way back when) I brings to mind all the extra cooling and setting
some valves extra loose and other stuff I've heard over the years.

This leads to my next question...

I guess I'll try to replace these injector seal gizmos the next time I
do valves.  This sounds simple, does anyone have any additional info?

This leads to my last question...

I've been eyeing those dial guage type valve adjusters in the catalogues.
I don't need much of an excuse to buy a new tool, but I'm curious if anyone
could give an evaluation of these things.  The only post I've seen on the
issue was someone (I forgot who) complaining that his valves didn't stay
adjusted, although I doubt that the dial guage was the fault.  Anyone 
particularly like or dislike these things?

One more which I'll try again...

Does anyone know of a simple CO2 sensor available.  I can't find any in
Snap-On or Mac.  I can imagine a little box without all the other diagnostic
stuff which would allow one to set idle CO2 without having to go to a
shop which I personally just hate to do ;-)

Just for curiosity's sake I'll add another question:

What *is* the accepted range of running temperature for an air cooled car?
Is it, or should it be, any different than a water cooled car (where I
would expect the max safe running temp to be no more than 225-230F).

I spend much of my time in or near the fog, and it get up to about 180F
unless it's a really cold or a really windy day (then maybe 170).  On a normal
summer day away from the fog I'll approach 205-210F. (in a '72 911T).

Are the recommendations as to a maximum temperature over a long run (like
SF to LA on Interstate 5)?

I guess now that I type it out it seems like a pretty silly question to
ask, but I've never seen a discussion of this topic...

Regarding oil temp, common received wisdom is that you begin seriously degrading
your mineral oil when its temperature reaches 240 degrees.  I believe that the
temperatures you see will depend on where in the engine your sender is located. 
I had someone recommend to me, today, that it be located in or near the galleys.

With this in mind, the indicated temperature, and your happiness with it, needs
to take into account the maximum real temperature of the oil in the whole
engine.  Hopefully our car's manufacturer has taken this differential into
consideration in recommending a maximum in your owner's manual!

Ah, but us 944 guys have no oil temp sender or gauge!  I am right now gathering
the parts needed to install one in my car.  This after reading Frank Kerfoot's
recent comments about 240+ temp's seen in 951's run at Lime Rock, as measured by
a pyrometer down the oil filler (or was it the dipstick?).  If anyone has ever
built such a device into his or her 944, I would be grateful for advice and
anecdotes.  I think I have a neat set-up, and will pass details along assuming
it works!  Tweeks sells a set-up which runs down the dipstick tube of all
Porsches, as well as a couple which work through the drain plug, I believe.

Btw, I have been seeing high oil temp's very occasionally in my (wife's) '90 VW
Jetta GLI (230 - 234 degrees), and have had the dealer's service manager trying
to figure it out.  His first move was to try to find what VW AG considers spec
or reasonable.  The answers he got from a couple of internal sources varied
wildly and were generally insane, one saying that anything up to 300 degrees was
OK!  So his only course of action was to go out and thrash several cars on the
lot, and see what kind of temperatures they got.

Regarding Scott's questions, your temperatures sound OK to my knowledge.  Check
out Bruce Anderson's book - I just did and you sound OK.  I remember him saying
a while ago, I think, that it was hard to get the earlier 911's to warm up
enough.  As the engine displacement increased, this problem went away.

Kids -

My two cents worth.  Buy only an OEM Porsche timing belt.  There are aftermarket
belts available; a friend found one in a car he bought which had been maintained
by one of eastern Mass' black sheep shops.  As a rule of thumb, when dealing
with a car's Achilles heal, stick with the best parts and service you can get. 
Porsche really does know what they're doing (in engineering; we can flame about
sales and marketing another day...).

The 30,000 mile change interval is a nice conservative figure.  PCNA tech
bulletin Group 0, Number 9001 requires replacing the camshaft drive belt every
45,000 miles in the 944S2, every 60,000 miles in the 928S4/GT.  Both should be
retensioned 2,000 to 2,500 miles thereafter.  It is also down for retensioning
every 30,000 miles.  The balance shaft belt is to be checked and retensioned
every 15,000 miles.  So, like, do them both annually and relax.

Tech bulletin Group 1, Number 9016 specifies that in 944 two-valve engines only
camshaft drive belts manufactured by Uniroyal/Gates may be used, and in 944
four-valve engines belts manufactured by Pirelli, designated by "RPP/HSN" on the
belt.  I believe the superceded 944S(2) belt was made by Goodyear, and I think
there is an aftermarket two-valve belt made by Continental.  Avoid.

Current production cars still require tensioning with the special tool.  I have
never heard it said that they no longer require maintenance, nor that they can
be properly maintained without the tool.  I would be interested to hear why
Steve's tech chair believes otherwise.

Cheers... Kevin

It's not easy to hear in a 911, but it's easy to feel, if you are
attuned to your car.  There is a definite power loss.  

   Common 
   wisdom (although I don't personally agree necessarily) in a water cooled
   car is that occasional detonation under heavy load is not damaging if
   is doesn't last too long.

Well, that is true.  Clearly the combustion chamber is designed to
contain an explosion, though it expects some give once it happens,
much of the force transferred into the downward motion of the piston.
When that doesn't happen, the force is absorbed by the rest of the
parts, mainly the rings.  Sporatic and infrequent detonation won't
damage an engine.  However, when a cylinder is running lean one would
expect it to detonate continuously, and eventually this will cause
failures.  If you run the car until it is hot, pull it over and just
run up the rpms you can hear this kind of detonation with a steth.
Another way you can cause continuous detonation is by always using
cheap low octane fuel.

Many FI systems with knock sensors actually lean out the mixture until
it starts to detonate, and then enrich it a little, so clearly
manufacturuers are expecting some detonation in their engines.

   Is oil temperature a reliable 
   indicator of overall engine temperature? 

In any car, it is a good measurement of the average temperature of the
engine (though considerably cooler, obviously).  This won't tell you
if you have one cylinder running lean.

   I've run in some fairly hot
   weather around here but not really hard.  I have heard about all the
   auxiliary oil cooling stuff one can do, is this necessary if you're not
   really running hard in the desert (is it necessary if you are)?  

Auxiliarly oil coolers are not necessary unless you are going to be
going to the track (or the desert).  Actually, I did drive through the
desert in a 911, and it was just fine.  Of course it was just straight
line driving without even slowing down, sort of like Indy...

   I've been eyeing those dial guage type valve adjusters in the catalogues.
   I don't need much of an excuse to buy a new tool, but I'm curious if anyone
   could give an evaluation of these things.  

The work very very well.  The only problem I've found with them is
that when I adjust the valves with that tool I have to get it perfect,
since the gauge is so accurate, and it ends up taking me twice as long.

   Does anyone know of a simple CO2 sensor available.  I can't find any in
   Snap-On or Mac.  I can imagine a little box without all the other diagnostic
   stuff which would allow one to set idle CO2 without having to go to a
   shop which I personally just hate to do ;-) 

I think you mean CO (Carbon Monoxide), and if you find one let me
knwo, I've been looking for one myself.

Subject:  various stuff



   What *is* the accepted range of running temperature for an air cooled car?
   Is it, or should it be, any different than a water cooled car (where I
   would expect the max safe running temp to be no more than
   225-230F).

As Kevin said, for any car mineral oil begins to break down around
240-250F.  You really should never see oil temps over 210F in an
air-cooled car if you're just out driving.  I think Mobil 1 starts
breaking down almost 50 degrees higher

OT for a 911 is 180F, that's when the thermostat opens (which is why
you can only check your oil level at OT).

OT is normal Operating Temp.

Being a '69 912 owner, I don't have the benefit of having a *numerical* 
engine temp guage.  I've seen my engine temp swing full scale (goes to
maximum on long uphill grades) and wonder how hot is too hot?  The guy I
bought my 912 from last year said that temp. "up to the red" is acceptable,
but to back off to keep it out of the red (full scale).  Is this true - I'd
hate to cook my engine.

Anyone know what approximate temps are at 1/2 and full scale on a 912?

If memory serves me correctly, this temp. probes oil temp on the engine
case, which leaves me clue-less as to cyl. head temp.  Is it worth it to
buy a cyl. head temp guage?  (I see those guage brackets in various
Porsche parts catalogs - but where in a '69 911/912 would one put a guage 
set that looks decent - seems to me it would look slightly cheesy under
the dash, but I don't feel like hacking my interior, either).

All 944 series cars, to my knowledge, still need the Porsche tool to tension
the balance belt. However, since the beginning of the '87 model year all
of the cars (except the 924S, I believe) have an internal device which performs
the retensioning with an internal spring when certain bolts are loosened
for the timing belt. See the factory shop manual or the yearly Porsche books.
Note that the adjustment still requires mechanic action every 15K miles
(as suggested by knowledgable PCA people), but the adjustment for the cam
belt does not require the tool. Unfortunately, prudance suggests retensioning
the balance belt at the same intervals, even though the cost of breakage
is lower, so you still need access to the tool.

Frank Kerfoot has kindly corrected me on a mistake in what I wrote regarding the
tensioning of 944-series cam belts.  You in fact do not need the tensioning tool
for '87-forward cars' cam belts.  Their cam belt is adjusted by loosening a bolt
and a nut (lovingly designated "A" and "B"), checking the mechanical tensioner
for unimpeded travel, then retightening the nut and the bolt.

This was covered in tech bulletin Group 1, No. 8620.  It also appears in the
workshop manual.  The mechanical tensioner appears in cars manufactured from 10
July 86, engine no's 43H01920 (manual) and 43H60385 (auto).

You still need the pricey tool for the less-critical balance shaft belts...

...I think, for anyone close to Massachusetts.  I dropped by the body shop I
patronize today (paint check-up, I kid you not), and the shop owner showed this
car to me.  The car is a very clean '86 944 Turbo, about 17,000 gentle miles,
and the asking price is $11,500.  Its owner has moved on to a BMW of sorts and
the dealer isn't real interested in the car.  (The dealership in question oozes
slime.)  I don't know the owner; she isn't a PCA member.

The car is sapphire metallic, black interior, has black Fuchs five-spoke alloys,
non-sport leather seats.  The only negative is that it does not have the
bellows-style exhaust upgrade.  Perhaps PCNA may still be interested in
replacing the part, though.  It does have the fuel hose recall done.

If interested, give Dick's Auto Body a call at 617 625 9171 and ask for Richard
or Frank.  (Very nice shop, honest people, top quality work.)  I have no
financial interest in the car or its sale, or the shop.  But I would appreciate
your mentioning my name, of course.  I am trying to convince Richard to pick it
up for his own use as a track car, so move quickly!

Perhaps someone knows the answer to this rather trivial question.  I ordered a
brake pad wear sensor for a friend's car, only to find that the old single-pad
sensor (951.612.212.00) had been superceded by a two-pad sensor (944.612.365.00)
plus a metal clip (928.612.361.00).

I don't know how to install this clip, nor has there been a tech bulletin on the
subject!  It would appear to slide onto one arm of the flat X anti-squeal
spring, and then to clip as well onto one of the two retaining pins.  The wire
between the two sensors would then push into another part of the clip.

Anyone know any better?  Personaly, I've long since tied off my pad sensors.  On
the plus side, though, this new part is about a third cheaper than the old one.

Subject: my "new" 914

I've recently become the owner of a 1973 914 2.0 which was partially
disassembled, and then abandoned for a year by its previous owner.
I've already reassembled it, replaced all missing parts, and gotten
it running.  Now it's time to get it running well, and to sort it out.
This is my second 914 2.0, so I'm fairly well-grounded in 914's.

My ultimate goal is to build the hottest, best handling 914-4 that I
can.  This will take me a while, but my immediate concerns are:

1) The heat exchangers are in pretty bad shape.  They're not rusted
   badly, but they leak exhaust onto the heads.  My usual parts source
   is trying to talk me out of headers and into stainless exchangers.
   I'm leaning toward headers (I don't really need/want heat, and I
   wouldn't mind removing a few useless parts).  Has anyone else put
   headers on their 914?  Any reasons why I shouldn't?  Sources for
   headers (Automotion is the only place that I've seen them)?

2) The engine is leaking a fair amount of oil, most obviously from the
   pushrod tubes.  I'm told that I can replace the tube seals with the
   engine in the car.  True?  Where else should I look for probable oil
   leaks?

I have a friend who goes on business trips frequently to Germany,

Are there any restrictions on as to how much one can bring over,

Subject: Bilsteins on late 944's


I am considering an update of the shocks on my '87 944S to improve
track performance in PCA drivers education events. I had originally 
assumed that Koni's were the answer, and was ready to order Koni "sport"
inserts (from Imparts) when I discovered that in '87, Porsche began using
sealed Sachs struts on non-turbo cars, similar to those used on the '86
turbo. While I was trying to figure out if I can simply bolt the Koni
strut replacements intended for turbos onto my non-turbo (I now believe
that I can), and while I was getting comfortable with another $100+ in
the cost, I have had several people whose opinions I respect (i.e. very
fast drivers) suggest that Bilsteins are a better choice. One of them
(Roy Chong) drives a significantly modified 944 Turbo. The custom
16 valve 944 Turbo described in a recent Panorama also claimed to use
Bilsteins.

The problem is that I can't find any Bilstein listing suitable for
Series II cars. The catalogs I have list them for 83-85, but not for
later 944's, turbo or otherwise. I know that AutoThority will put
custom valved Bilsteins in my stock struts for $1000, which will take
me even longer (if ever) to get comfortable with. Otherwise, I can't
figure out how the others are doing it. I can chase it through the
Pano article author, or the shop they reference, or wait until I see
Roy Chong again, but I thought that someone on this list might have
some insight. Any ideas?

On the same subject, does anyone have an independent opinion of the
desirability of Bilsteins versus Konis for a street driven car which
is used in track driving? If it is relevant, I do not plan to go with
the whole extra-stiff suspension (250# springs, 26 mm torsion bars,
Weltmeister sway bars, etc). I expect to either keep the street springs
or possibly go to the slightly stiffer "street sport" springs offered
as a factory option on early 944s (~150# springs, 24.5 mm torsion bars).
I mention the latter because I have heard that Konis are especially
effective with relatively stiff springs.

Subject: Dolly-towing a 914

I'm planning on towing my 914 to the SCCA Solo II Nationals on a dolly.
That's about 1200 miles each way.

Question 1: Should I put the front end or the rear end on the dolly?

	Putting the car forwards eliminates the problem of needing to lock
	the steering.

	Putting the car backwards helps weight balance, and keeps the
	drivetrain from rotating.  Do I need to worry about that?

Question 2: How to I lock the steering or disconnect the drivetrain?

	If I put the car on backwards, I'll need to lock the steering.
	The car has no steering lock (is it supposed to?), and so I'll need
	to rig something.  Any suggestions?

	If I put the car on forwards, it seems smart to disconnect the
	drivetrain from the rear wheels.  I assume the only way to do this
	is to disconnect and/or remove the halfshafts.  How big a deal is
	this?  Is it easy to put it back together when I get there?

Any comments or suggestions would be most welcome.

i towed my 912 with the following ideas in mind.  If you have an automatic,
you may tow it short distances at moderate speed without hurting the
tranny (did auto 914's exist?).  A manual transmission car can be
towed almost indefinetely in neutral with no damage.  I removed both
driveshafts since my boots were shot from sitting, and I did not want to hurt
the joints with the dusty roads.  I took out the 6 bolts on the CV joints.
I also had to remove the rear callipers since they were sticking and the
disk was getting warm.  I just unbolted them and disconnected the lines.
I bought a brake line, cut it in half, and twisted the ends up and installed
them in the car so the fluid did not leak out.

Subject: Re:  Dolly-towing a 914

  Last year I towed my 911 from Texas to North Carolina - I'll relate what I
did.

First of all, I had an adapter made to allow a hitch to be bolted to the front
unibody frame (have to take off the bumper and stick it inside), so I didn't
use a dolly.  I kept the steering unlocked to allow the car to track with the
truck (the 914 does have locking steering...try taking out the ignition
cylinder sometime).  I towed the car from the front - this should also apply
if you use the dolly.  I towed a 914 from Arkansas to Texas that way once -
no problems.

Towing the car may or may not be bad on the transmission - you are driving
the differential in reverse, making gear surfaces contact each other that
normally do not.  From a stock car racer friend of mine, 9 out of 10 times
you'll be ok - but you don't want to be the unlucky one.  At >$1300 for a
transmission, I took off the driveshafts and threw them in the trunk.  Make
sure you release the parking brake.  For a 914, you need the wierd star-allen
key to take off the shafts - the outside CV's are a pain because they are
inside the control arm...  For a 911, you need an 8mm allen socket.  When I
took mine off, I found a broken CV boot and the joint was filled with sand, so
it's a good thing I decided to take them off.  This is a good time to change
your CV joint boots and CV gaskets.  Be careful to torque the bolts properly
when reinstalling the driveshafts (I've never found a torque quote...).
Loctite is good to use here - I've had problems with bolts shearing from
overtorquing them and backing out from undertorquing them.  Also use a good
CV joint grease (Tweeks sells it - I forget what it's called).

You get lots of wierd looks from people as your towing you Porsche...

Subject: Setting 944/951 idle mixture


Recent postings about oil temperature and CO sensors has motivated me
to relate a mystery I am currently working on.  I recently attempted
to set the idle mixture on my 951 without the benefit of an exhaust
gas analyzer or oil temperature sensor.  My plan was to start the
engine cold, run it up to operating temperature, then measure the
voltage coming out of the oxygen sensor.  I expected that as I leaned
and richened the mixture (by tweaking the air flow sensor) I would see
voltages between 0.1V and 0.9V, respectively.  I would then have set
the mixture so that the oxygen sensor showed a voltage at the
midpoint, approximately 0.5V.  I once saw a mechanic at an independent
shop adjust the idle mixture this way, and the Bosch fuel injection
book by Probst describes this procedure as a reasonable approximation
for those of us without CO analyzers.  Still somewhat skeptical about
this procedure, I asked a Bosch rep at the Monterey Parade whether
or not this procedure could get you close to the ideal mixture, and,
to my surprise, even he said that it worked pretty well.

The problem is that my oxygen sensor always reads a fairly constant
0.82V, indicating a rich mixture, no matter how much I turn the air
flow meter adjustment screw.  This follows the warm-up period during
which the voltage steadily ramps up from zero.  The adjustment of the
air flow sensor screw is obviously having some effect in the rich
limit, since, when it is screwed all the way in, there is a noticible
amount of unburned fuel coming out of the exhaust.  The oxygen sensor
voltage remains at 0.82V in this limit, which is probably this sensor's
maximum voltage.  Unfortunately, I have no way of checking how lean
the mixture is getting with the screw all the way out, but the voltage
does not drop as I would have expected.  I can think of a few
possibilities here:

1.  The engine is too warm when I am taking the reading.  Without
an oil temperature sensor, I have to guess when I'm at "operating
temperature", which is defined to be 158-194F in the factory manual.
My approach was to start the engine cold, then let it warm up until
the radiator fans turned on and then off.  I seem to remember 
this functional definition of OT from somewhere, but someone's
experienced confirmation or rebuttal would be welcome.

2.  The oxygen sensor is defective.  This is unlikely, since the
sensor is brand new (my first attempt at all this found the sensor
reading a constant 0V (i.e., kaput), so I replaced it).  I believe the
failure mode of these things would always result in little or no
voltage, since they are batteries of a sort.

3.  Something else is broken in my injection system, and the brain is
defaulting to a rich mixture.  I performed all the checks of the
the air flow sensor, air and engine temperature sensors described
in the factory manual, and everything was nominal.

Although there are a few more things I can check, if anyone has had
any related experiences, your hints or comments might save me
some time!

I believe this process works, but only if you disconnect the oxygen
sensor from the control box. Otherwise, the value of the oxygen sensor
voltage is being used in a feedback loop which is adjusting the mixture
to provide a constant reading from the sensor. When you disconnect the 
sensor, the brain goes to a default setting, and now you can adjust
the air flow sensor bypass to provide optimum mixture.  By the way,
it sounds like the sensor voltage you should adjust to is 0.82 V,
since that is where the brain thinks it ought to be when the loop is
closed. I've forgotten all the details, but I believe that 0.82 V is
still in the active range of the sensor. A second point is that the
adjustment of the air flow sensor bypass really only matters during
warm-up, before the oxygen sensor is active to allow closed loop control
(as you discovered by experiment).

Subject: Re:  parts in Germany


	I was wondering if anyone had experience in getting parts directly
	from Germany, since the cost of 928 parts are killing me.

	I have a friend who goes on business trips frequently to Germany,
	and would be nice if I can save some good old $$$.

	Are there any restrictions on as to how much one can bring over,
	or are the prices not that great compared to discount places?


	p.s. Parts like feul pump, pistons, valves.

The prices i've seen in german magazines, for 911 parts admittedly(unofficial), are not much different to those quoted by independant sources in the UK, and of those in the usa. The problem, I suppose is whether you "distrust"/can't afford your local supplier in the usa enough to make it worthwhile going to the effort of looking elsewhere.	

As for official Porsche parts prices I can't say, but consider the fact that Porsche car prices are cheaper in the usa!  and that you would have to pay import taxes/increase friends baggage allowance etc. etc.

I'd say it's not worth it :-( , but try rec.autos, there are a few readers there that live in Germany and may know better.

I too know of no sources for this application.  You can call up Canadian

I asked Fredene Plouff and her husband Art about them at the Parade, and she
recommended them as nice folks, very supportive of their PCA region.  David in
the parts dept. at Downtown Fine Cars in Toronto also pointed me to them.  (I
was looking for an NLA (sigh) Rothmans cup car stress bar, and David suggested
CP as a possible source for an alternative.)

I may have a Bilstein catalogue and phone number buried at home, and can dig
for it if you're interested.

Shock absorbers, beyond a point, fall pretty low in the go-fast food chain to
my understanding.  Unless you only drive one track or are into re-valving them
for each track you go to, I would guess that these fancier shocks aren't
yielding any benefit.  Your basic Koni sport shock is quite sufficient.  My

Frank,

Sorry if I was unclear about my procedure, but I did disable the
closed loop.  I unplugged the oxygen sensor from the DME harness
connector that rides in a clip in the engine compartment.  I then
attached the voltmeter lead directly onto the male connector at the
end of the wire from the oxygen sensor.  I also read the voltage on
the female connector from the DME box and got a voltage of
approximately 0.45V.  This is evidently the fallback voltage that the
DME box uses as an input when the sensor is disconnected or fails.  I
thought it was significant that this voltage was close to what I was
expecting the sensor itself to generate, but maybe it's just a
coincidence.

I do believe that the operating range of the sensor is 0.1V to 0.9V,
so my 0.82V is OK from that standpoint.  I guess I was surprised to
see it so near one extreme, but maybe new sensors always read high and
lose their voltage generating ability over time.

>A second point is that the

If this is so, then why does the factory manual dictate that the
engine be at OT before the air flow meter screw is adjusted?

I don't think the voltage on the input side (i.e. the brain box) is
meaningful for anything but determining any bias conditions applied
to the sensor by the brain box, and I don't think an oxygen sensor
needs any bias (or you couldn't just look at it separately with the
voltmeter).

The car needs to be at OT so the oxygen sensor is functional, even though
the system is open loop in this calibration mode. You want to adjust the
default (open loop) idle mixture at OT, trusting that from this starting
point the system can richen the mixture appropriately for cold running
based on the water and air temperature sensors. Actually, I haven't
read the factory manual very carefully on this subject, since they
claim you can't (or shouldn't) adjust CO (i.e. mixture) on my
car ('87 944S). I did talk to the Bosch rep. at the Parade about it,
as a possible way of helping a cold start condition I have.
.P
Based on this I am at a loss for why you don't see a change. You may want
to try a surer way of changing the mixture, such as a small deflection of
the air flow sensor vane, to diagnose the problem. I'd be interested in 
your conclusions.
