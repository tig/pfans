Subject: 914 trailing arm bushings

I want to replace the rear trailing arm bushings on my 914.  Currently I've
got the original 19-year-old rubber bushings, and I have a set of
Weltmeister plastic bushings to put in.

The book wants me to remove the heat exchangers, driveshafts, hubs and
bearings, brakes, and everything in order to drop the trailing arm
completely out of the car.  However, it *looks* like I should be able to
just drop the front end of the trailing arm down without removing any of
that junk.

Question: Am I correct?  If so, would dropping the front of the trailing
arms do me any good -- that is, will I be able to get the old bushings out
and the new bushings in without a press or something?

Thanks for any help you can provide...

Mark

Subject: 914: Flaring the rear fenders

My 914 has considerably less space under the left rear wheelwell than the
right rear.  I've talked with one other 914 guy who says that's true for him
as well.  Have any other 914 people experienced this?  Those who have 914's,
would you be willing to measure and let me know?  Just jack the car up (I
don't think you'll have to remove the wheel) and measure from the inside
edge of the wheelwell to the fender lip.

In any case, it looks like I'll need some very gentle flares on the rear
fenders in order fit the new wheels.  I *might* not need any flare on the
right rear, in fact.  Someone locally told me about some hydraulic device
for stretching the metal...  Does anyone know anything about this?  Since I
need so little flare, this possibility seems better to me than cutting and
applying fiberglass.  What are the accepted techniques for flaring the
fenders?

Thanks for any help.  Please note that this is crossposted to both the
porschephiles and autocross mailing lists.

I used to do a lot of 4-wheel alignments on 914's and I own a 73 2.0 now.
The norm was that the drivers side always had less space between the rear
tire and fender.  It always made alignments a real hassle.

I personally dont care much for flares on a 914.  What I plan to have done 
is to slightly stretch the rear quarter panel/fender by applying heat and
outward uniform pressure.  A friend I knew, when I used to be an avid Autox'r,
had this done to his and most people couldn't tell the difference between
his and a stock 914.  With this mod he was running 16x7 Porsche alloys
on drilled 914 rotors.  The car looked awsome and performed well with no
clearance problems.   

My problem is that it was a long time ago and I  don't know where he had 
it done.  Sometime in the future I will call the body shops in the San 
Franscisco  bay area that I can remember doing business with back then.
Worst case, I have an extra body of a 914 1.8 that I can use to test on.

Subject: Bluebonnet Trails 92

            Bluebonnet Trails VI Rallye
                Maverick Region, PCA
                    May 2, 1992
              Rallyemaster Bob Benson
 
Bluebonnet Trails VI was designed as a simple tour through the
wildflowers, and I expected some low scores. I was surprised at how low
they actually were. A nine for the day only takes third? The event tied
for the largest Class A field seen in a local event. Some folks were
just running for the tour in the country; only one of those even
submitted their score card. And there were some novices, running without
benefit of a rallye school. They finished. Then there were the rest.
They were serious and came looking for a win, producing both low and
close scores. Maybe I should have upped the difficulty factor - the
course and rules would support a rather devious event, with just a few
wording changes here and there in the routes.
 
The event was measured and timed to 0.001 mile, the timing in seconds.
Thirteen controls over 174 all-paved miles kept two worker crews busy.
Yes, holding to a +/-0.001 mile measurement tolerance while I was
building it was a bit difficult, given the old and new tires, the near
floods, the cold overcasts and the hot, bright Texas sun. It was worth
it - I like their smiles when the computer cars report measurements, and
their factor, holding rock solid all day long, even on a 30+ mile leg.
(Hint for other attempting this: use the cruise control when safe while
measuring; you CAN see excess lane changes and tire stretch in our
non-expandable radials, at least if you ever approach warp speeds.)
 
The wildflowers? Personally, I was somewhat disappointed. But then, I'd
seen them at their peak. A warm, wet non-winter brought them out early.
The competitors liked them, folks from Houston reporting astonishment.
Well, the bluebonnets and paint brush were gone, but the various yellows
and whites were coming on stong, and the red and orange fire blankets
were lighting up many a mile. Just wish some folks hadn't already
decided to mow some of the road shoulders.
 
Results? Ed Tix naved Wayne Pershing to a best score of the day. Ed's
voice was almost working again, after having to use hand signs a week
prior to nav Herschel Crump to a fourth place overall at the Texas Old
Car Race. Meanwhile, Herschel cleaned up running SOP in Class C, naved
by Jan Cook (!!Look at that SOP score - only one "bad" leg!!). Jan had
naved to win the special MDA charity event held in connection with the
TOCR. Is this beginning to sound like inbreeding? And look out for CE
Butridge on the IBGAR this summer - this score was him naving for wife
Shirley, not driving his regular nav around. The maxes on leg 10
represent assorted difficulties novices had with a long transit zone.
The maxes on leg 11 represent novices on a 30+ mile leg. There were no
ties, but some positions were decided by only a point or two. As I said,
I expected low scores from our top folks, but Ed and Wayne beat that
expectation. Maybe we need to estimate at less than a half point per leg
when doing it in thousandths.
 
Special thanks to the workers: control crews, Joel and Erika Nannis, Don
and Taxi Breithaupt, who had last seen part of the course in 1988 and
laid on some hard miles making the jumps; to the checkrun crew of John
and Sandra Andrews, who could not participate in the event itself; and
to my wife, Pat, for helping with the last minute night-before details
and still being able to handle sweep. Also, thanks to the bicycle racers
on the last legs of their 150K course that followed our course for 30
miles and two controls, for being just far enough ahead that we only
passed a few stragglers instead of a field of several hundred. And, of
course, to the competitors, without whom I probably wouldn't engage in
this insanity.
 

Well, I see that something somewhere in my file transfer process did a
line wrap "for me" out about the 80th column.  In honor of some of the
mail systems around, I'll leave it that way and let y'all unwrap them.

I'm reassembling my 914 engine and would like to take care of some
corrosion on some of the cooling sheetmetal.  What type/brand of paint
is appropriate for these pieces?  I'll clean the rust off completely
first.

I found the best paint for this is Harley Davidson frame paint.
I don't know who makes it so you need to go to the HD dealer to get it.
It is the best quality black paint in a spray can I have used.

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!


I am traveling heavily for the next few months. As a result, list maintenence
will be once a week unless I get lucky and have more time. Please keep this
in mind if you have problems.

And remember, I now edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region. 
If you happen to have on-line copies of your regional newsletter, or
at least the interesting articles, maybe we can set up an article exchange.
Or, if you'd like to write something or have something written that you'd like
to see in print outside of your own region, let me know....

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, join!! 
I'm going to investigate getting permission to create an "electronic region"
where the "region boundaries" are defined by network connectivity. Won't
displace your regular physical region, but hey, you should see how we'd
get to do the driving events... 8{)

Porsche Club of Americia.
Does take non-US membership.
+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.
Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy, if you own a car.

Porsche Club of Great Britain
Ayton House
West End
Northleach
Gloucestershire
England GL54 3HG
Telephone : +44 451 60792

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@karazm.math.uh.edu


The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) Please try to send all administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, as some members have discovered,
   you can also reach me by phone (sometimes).

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address. Such messages are discarded.

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Reply-To: thode@nprdc.navy.mil

I saw Stan's list of Porschephiles and wondered how they were 
distributed geographically.  I don't know if anyone else cares, 
but here is how the 99 people on Stan's list break out:

        New York        6
        Illinois        4
        Michigan        4         UNITED KINGDOM:   2

I'd like to convert my 914/4 from wheel bolts to wheel studs (retaining the

that "standard" Porsche studs will not work, as those are press-in, and on the
914/4 hubs, there's nothing to keep them in place.  Is that correct?

Also, anyone know the thread pitch of the stock 14mm studs/bolts offhand?

Subject: 951 power steering leak


The passenger side boot on my steering rack has accumulated a fair
amount of fluid.  I am virtually ignorant of the inner workings of
power-assisted rack and pinion steering, but I have this picture in my
mind of the cylinder to which the tie rods attach sliding through some
sort of seal, which has now developed a leak.  According to my factory
manual, these racks cannot be serviced and must be replaced $$$$.  Has
anyone out there had any experience with this sort of problem?

Subject: 944 Power Steering Rack

Funny you should mention the power steering rack for 944/951.

The rack is only rebuildable by "qualified service center" (read
factory or OEM manufacturer (I think ZF).  PAP quoted a rebuilt
price in the mid-$200 range.

I had heard that, for most purposes, if you do not do a lot of
parallel parking, etc., you can remove the reservoir, power steering
pump, and hoses, and run the power steering rack without the fluid as
a non-power rack.  Certainly, this would be the cheapest fix for the
problem...

Question is, has anybody done this, seen this done, or heard of a FOAF
who has done this?  Any pitfalls?  Any comments?

I've done this a few times, a Voyager, 86 Charger, 77 Audi 100:  Nothing
that really needed power steering to begin with.  I just yanked everything
except the rack and then kludged together some filters for the orifices
after having worked the rack back and forth to expell most all the fluid.
The filters were just some of the pipe jammed full of clean rags and crimped
off and reinstalled.  Works great.

However, I've got a 931 with no PS (came that way).  For most manouvering 
and driving it's real nice, good feel.  But for close quarters wheel cranking
it steers HARD.  Also it seems to me that wheel turning effort anywhere
near the limit at speeds upwards of 90 is extremely high.  I suspect this
is payback for the "on rails" feel of negative roll radius, at speed you
need two arms and knee in the console to hang on to that wheel.  This is
largely irrelevant to streetworthyness, but if you run track events I'd
surely reccommend that you keep the PS.

The good news is you can try it at no expense, just disconnect the hoses
from the rack, turn from lock to lock to expell fluid, disconnect the belt,
plug the lines, and drive it around for a while to see if you like it or not.
If not, get a new rack.

Subject: Sunbeam Venezia Superlegarra Coupe information desperately needed

Help!

I'm desperately trying to find information about two Sunbeam Venezia 
Superlegarra Coupes I'm planning to purchase.  They are number 99 & number 110.

Venezias are aluminum bodied Sunbeam coupes with tube frames and Alpne 
running gear(?).  Around 202 are rumored to have been built around 1960.  
That's the total of my current knowledge, unfortunately.

Has anyone heard of or know how to contact a "Sunbeam Venezia" Club that's 
rumored to exist in either Europe or the United States.

Any Venezia information will be greatly appreciated:

  o  Current value.
  o  The number that still exist in the states and/or the world.
  o  The last time you saw one.
  o  Any statistic or the like.  

Thanks.

Subject: Should I start servicing my '89 951?

I've decided that I need to take a more active role in servicing my
'89 951.  Relying on my friendly mechanic(s) to do everything is too
expensive.  I have two questions: one general and one specific.

1.  Do I need to buy the 924 service manuals as well as the 944 and
944 Turbo manuals?  Is there a cheaper source than my local dealer
(who quoted a price of $250 for the 944/944T manuals).

2. My clutch, which was replaced at Carlsen Porsche-Audi in Palo Alto
one year ago, is malfunctioning.  It is almost impossible to shift the
transmission into reverse with the engine running, but the transmission
shifts into forward gears without any problem.  With the engine off, 
I can shift into reverse normally.  Has anyone had experience with a 
similar problem?
Do I need to tear down the clutch (which I understand requires removing the
exhaust system and transaxle) to diagnose the problem?  If I do have
to replace my clutch, is a sturdier, competition clutch available?

Let me provide some more information for the diagnostic wizards
reading this message.  In May of last year near the
end of a trip to Palo Alto California, my clutch failed
completely; it would not disengage.  For two months prior to the failure
of the clutch, I had had occasional problems with gears grinding on 1-2 
upshifts (as if the clutch were not disengaging completely).   When
my clutch failed, I had the car towed to Carlsen Porsche-Audi where my
clutch, pressure plate, pilot and throwout bearings, and flywheel were
all replaced under warranty (less than three weeks from the expiration
date!).  Carlsen reported that a spring (or springs) in the clutch plate had 
broken and that spring fragments were preventing the clutch from disengaging.
The intermittent gear grinding that I experience earlier evidently was
an early symptom of the problem.

After the clutch was replaced, it worked perfectly
until last Saturday, when the gearbox suddenly felt stiff while I
was pulling the car into the garage after a short drive.  The transmission
would shift into forward gears with some resistance (action of synchronizers?)
but not into reverse.  A mechanically inclined friend tried to help me diagnose 
the problem.  He hypothesized that
the clutch was not disengaging completely and inspected the
hydraulic system controlling the clutch.  He noticed that the fluid level 
in the brake fluid reservoir, which apparently supplies the hydraulic
clutch as well, was marginal (at the minimum mark or a smidgeon below).
After he added more brake fluid to bring the level up to the maximum mark,
the clutch action improved to the point where shifts into forward gears
felt normal, but the transmission still would not shift into reverse.

Yesterday, I took the car to a local Porsche dealer (Momentum BMW-Porsche) 
to have the brake fluid replaced (the dealer was running a ``special''). 
I told the dealer about the problem with my transmission which I hoped 
that bleeding the clutch line would fix.  I thought I might have air
in the hydraulic line to the clutch.  The mechanic at the dealer
changed the brake fluid and reported that it didn't solve the problem.
He then examined the movement of the clutch arm and claimed that the
clutch pedal was moving the arm as far the clutch internals would permit
it.  He said he would have to tear down the clutch to fix it.  At this
point, I demanded my car back so I could take it to an independent mechanic
whom I trust.  I'm also considering doing the job myself with the aid
of my friend.  I have some experience working on cars (I kept a '71
Chevy Vega alive for 9 years) and my friend has a lot (but not on
Porsches).  Up to now, I have been reluctant to work on my 951 because 
it is much more complicated and sophisticated than the other cars that 
I have worked on.  On the other hand, I am not sure I can afford to
maintain my 951 unless I start doing most of the work.  Any recommendations?

Corky -

The price you were quoted for the manuals seems pretty reasonable.  Check what
places like Performance Products want.  Also be aware that the 944 Turbo manual
is a separate volume (=> separate p/n, separate $).  You don't "need" the 924
manuals.  But then I've never seen the 924 manual set, and don't know what
fascinating tidbits they include.

I would recommend you look over a friend's 944 manual set before plunking down
the money.  You may decide, as have some, that they aren't worth the money. 
They give detailed and specific information, not general how-to stuff.

Regarding your stiff shifting, I haven't a good answer.  I hope that the
dealership checked the transmission for adequate fluid level.  You can check the
release lever travel at the inspection port on the clutch bell housing.  If
memory serves, you want no less than 15 mm. of travel to insure correct release.
Inadequate travel can be due to air in the hydraulics.  You can also check
thickness of the friction material through this port.

As for other clutch failure modes, it may be that a tear-down is necessary. 
With the rubber-centred 944 and 944S clutches, you can check for deterioration
by grabbing and twisted the drive tube at the transmission.  Not so for the
spring-centred 951 and 951S (and I guess 944S2).  A tear-down may be the only
way to look for friction surface deterioration, plate warping, lost springs.

I would also check my motor mounts.  If one suddenly collapsed, it might explain
difficulty in shifting.

Subject: 88' 924S; Is this good buy (in Japan)???

Hello. This is the first time I post to this list. Actually, I never read
this list, so I would be sorry if this mail is out of line with the nature
of the list. But this is a bit urgent. I'm posting this from Japan, btw.

The other day, I was shopping around for a used Mazda Miata, and found
88' 924S for 13,000 bucks. This is way chaeper than the average in Japan
(around 18,000 bucks), and almost as much as fully-equiped Miata. I never
dreamed of buying Prosche in my life. So there are lots of unknowns. Please
advice me via mail (I think I'm not registered to the list yet). And, please
don't say 924S is not a real Porsche. The detail of the car is;

1988 model (last year for 924S); thus the same power unit as 944S. (2.5l 4cyl)
16,000 miles
3-speed AT (yuck!)
Sun roof.
Looks mint.

My main concerns are,
How is 924S reliability-wise? I know 924S is discontinued. Do you know why?
How is gas milege with 3-speed AT? (Please don't say a real Porsche owner
don't care gas milege.)
I know most Japanese car has more muscle than 924S. Is 924S too wimpy for the
money? I expect handling is much better. (The dealer won't allow me to
test-drive by the last minutes.) Would you buy 924S, if you can buy twice
the power at the same price (e.g. RX-7).

Thanks a zillion in advance.

Amen.  This fact has turned me into more of a mechanic than I would
ever have imagined in my wildest dreams.

I think that $250 is pretty much the going rate for 944 manuals
including the Turbo volume, even in the aftermarket.  You might try
calling Automechanika (1-800-582-2886).  Their manual prices were
pretty good when I bought mine a few years ago.

Having replaced my clutch recently (a broken disc spring), I can
attest (as can others on this list) to the feasibility of doing this
yourself.  This would not be my first recommendation for how to "get
your feet wet" working on your car, but your clutch probably does not
care about this.  Although it is a pain removing so many parts to even
get to the clutch, in my opinion the hardest part (which is true of
many of the repairs one has to make on the 951) is getting into tight
spots to unbolt things.  You should have a decent supply of tools on
hand including long extensions and flexible sockets.  You should also
try to find plenty of time and patience...

My tires are bald so while I'm replacing tires I thought I could put

for a 911.

Thanks in advance,

PS, I sold my 951 even though it was an excellent car.  But it had
almost 100k miles on it and I guess I'm just to used to the old 911.
I replaced it with an 84 Carrera.  I also purchased a 73 914 2.0 to
satisfy my desires for autoxing.

since most Porsches ride fairly low to the ground, do you have enough
room to get under the car and do work using only jackstands/ramps?  Seems
like a service bay lift would be the only way to really do work like
fixing a clutch.  Comments?

Alas, I would have loved to have had access to a lift for the clutch
job.  However, this is not essential.  The 944's "lowness to the
ground" does prevent the use of ramps, but I have a set of 6 ton truck
jackstands that easily get the car far enough off the ground to remove
the transaxle and exhaust system.  I extended the stands as high as
they would reasonably go to maximize clearance, but I later had to
lower them a bit so that my floor jack could reach the transaxle to
lower it out.

-Milo

P.S.: I was plenty sore from the contortions required to do
the job on a creeper.

Actually, when I was rebuilding a 77 1/2 924 3 years or so ago, I welded up
a set of ramps that were long enough to be functional even with the reduced
ground clearance.  It can be done, but I dunno that I'd recommend it in 
general... as Milo pointed out, spending all day on a creeper is not my idea of
a good time...

Likely this message is unnecessary for this audience. However...  :-)
An obvious spot to insert a safety message gang! Be EVER so careful that your
home made ramps are strong enough to safely support the car. I know a guy who
was almost crushed by the collapse of ramps, that he made himself
under the notion that they were made strong enough to support a gravel truck.
They looked sturdy, but collapsed sideways when he put pressure on a wrench.
A good mechanic. But not a very good design engineer. ken.

Hi All:

Being a "new" owner of a '66 912, I'm looking forward to
Stoddard's swap meet in Ohio.  I believe its June 13.
Did anyone go last year?  How good is it - in terms of *parts*?
Especially for old 911/912s - interior, mechanical, etc...

I would have to drive out from Chicago, IL and am wondering if
its worth my time.  Currently, I'm having a new floor pan, inner/outer
rockers, fender-spacers, and door-jams all welded in the car (for $500
labor which I think is a great price) this month.

I have wound up, through strange circumstances, with a pair of brand new Comp
T/A tires I don't need, in size 245/45x16.  These are street compound (104), not
road race or autox!  Best reasonable offer takes them.  Would prefer to avoid
shipping; those of you in eastern Mass/southern NH are specifically encouraged
to reply!

To: "porschephiles" <porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu>

Background: My car got stolen. My uncle, who collects cars, gave me his
non-running '73 914. I've done a lot of work on the thing, and have gotten
it running. I just need to cut through the red tape to get it registered
and all, and I'll be on the road.

Question: Here in Los Angeles, it's gotten quite difficult to find leaded 
gasoline. I've been told by some people that as long as the Octane rating is 
as high or higher than the factory specs, it's not harmful to run on 
unleaded. I've been told by other people that high Octane is not enough, and 
that I need to use a gas additive.

So what's the deal? If I understand correctly, Octane makes gasoline less 
"explosive" and helps it burn more evenly by sort of deccelerating the
burn. I've been told that lead is put into gasoline for the same purpose,
and/or to give it lubricant characteristics (!?), not to mention a lot of
things that don't make sense like "reducing the temperature of the burn"
and to "increase the viscosity of the fuel."

Since I don't really know the physics of the situation, I can't figure out 
the right answer. Anyone know?

Thanks!

Subject: Porsche kit cars?????



A little help please......

I've seen some kit cars of the 50's and 60's 356 models and the speedster
model advertized and they look pretty nice.
I was wondering if anyone had any information on the quality and pricing 
of these types of cars? 
Should they be avoided or are they descent cars for the right price? The 
ones I have seen are advertized for around $9000.

Any help and/or info would be appreciated!

Well, you're going to find that half the world hates 'em and the other half
loves 'em.  I had a chap drive up to my house really early in the spring of last
year (ie, very cold out), all bundled up in a guards red Beck repro-spyder.  He
loves the car, it looks incredibly sharp, and he got an awful lot of attention!

If I really wanted to drive a car like this (and I would), and given that Gloria
von Thurn und Taxis continues to spurn my offers of marriage, I think I would
definitely go for the Beck kit.

I helped with a fake Speedster a few years ago. It was OK, but had MAJOR
"fit and finish" problems. The guy who's car it was decided to spend the
money to fix all that with your basic $4k paint job. The VW Type 1 running
gear really isn't that far from the old 356 stuff. We did upgrade the
brakes to all wheel disk; similar upgrades for the suspension. And we added
a roll bar and I did some chassis triangulation. When it was all done, he
had about $22k invested and had a roughly 1300 pound car with about 145 HP
engine. It was a true rocket, and could handle and stop to match the power.

One of the guys in the local PCA region has a Beck psuedo-Sypder. It's
a neat car. I'd like one myself. I'd probably go with 914 running gear
instead of the Type 1 stuff he used, though.

On the other hand, you can get good 356s for under $20k, and then you
really have something. True, what you may have is an opportunity to 
spend more money, but hey....

It is against my personal policy to forward mail that is mis-sent to
"Porschephiles-request". However since this is from a new guy who
probably hasn't seen (or read) the monthly how-to-use-the-group posting,
he may not know that if you use the vanilla System V mailer, you will
generate a reply to "porschephiles-request" instead of "porschephiles".

So, I thought I'd take the opportunity to remind everyone and actually pass
this message on because someone might find it useful.

The most common tire upgrade for a 914 is to 185-70/15, which has essentially
the same rolling radius as 165/15 (with an assumed aspect ratio of .78).
These fit fine with plenty of clearance using any of the stock 914
wheels. There might be a problem if one of the VW wheels (e.g. Riviera)
is used, but they may still fit. I know that 185-70/15 is fine on a 5.5"
rim, I suspect they would be ok on the 4.5" rims used on the early 914s.
Check with a tire company if that is what you have. My favorite for
performance per dollar is Vredesten, which used to be in the $50 range
and were exceptionally good tires at that price.

Another somewhat less commonly used alternative is 205-60/15, which also
has the same rolling radius. Here, there is more of an issue with
clearance, even on stock 5.5" wheels, although I know many 914s with
stock fenders which have used this size successfully. Find someone with
a 914 with 205-60's, and swap wheels for a final check. Note that
there are small variations in dimensions from one manufacturer to another
of a particular tire size, so keep that in mind when doing a swap to
look for clearance. Rear suspension adjustment, especially camber,
matters, so if you are planning on changing rear camber, do it before
you to the clearance check.

195-60/15, as suggested by Soren, is a reasonable alternative that 
has been tried by several 914 drivers I know. There is a noticeable
change in gearing, but some find that desirable. The primary
disadvantage is that you will wind the engine somewhat tighter on
the highway, and the speedometer will be inaccurate. On the stock
5.5" wheels, I would not expect a clearance problem.

Over all, unless you have some special application in mind like
autocrossing, I would suggest 185-70/15. The added benefit from 
either the 195-60 or the 205-60/15 tires for ordinary street driving
would be essentially imperceptable. The only additional issue is that
the particular type of high performance tire you decide you want to
buy (if in fact that is what you want) may not be made in a 70 series.

I've personally run 195/60-15 Yokohama A509's on a 914 (factory 5.5x15
steel wheels) with excellent results.  If rolling circumference is an issue,
Yokohama does make their AVS Intermediate and A008P tires in 195/65-15,
which is almost identical in circumference to the O.E. 165-15 (== 165/78-15)
tires.

Thank you all for your suggestions and comments I first tried a full tank
of gas, And that did not help. So I went back to the engine compartment and
made sure any wire I could fins was not loose and reseated some of them in
the process. I also tighted down the FI Unit and Relay box. The oil level was
fine. I then drove on the same roads as before and the car no longer dies. 


Thanks again.

Subject: More 944 cam belt musings
Message-Id: <85920519014658/0004056890NA2EM@mcimail.com>

This morning, I went over with my mechanic the damage to yet another 944S whose
timing belt failed.  The car is a customer's, and he had checked and retensioned
the belt about 7,500 miles prior to its failure.  The belt was in even worse
shape than mine was after it failed last fall.  Unfortunately, the part numbers
and all markings seem to have been rubbed off the back of the belt, so I am
unsure of its version.

The real surprise lay in the crank sprocket.  It was missing a chunk out of
itself on the front shoulder, basically at one end of a tooth but extending
below the tooth into centre.  All of the teeth, hill and dale, were very worn. 
The teeth themselves were scalloped axially, ie, along their length.  There is
also what appears to be a hairline fracture at the base of the chunked sprocket
tooth, along the length of one side of the base of that tooth.   The sprocket
part was 944.105.125.05, which has been superceded by 944.105.125.06.

We cannot imagine why this sprocket would be so worn, or even less why a chuck
would be missing.  The chunk lay at the front end of the gear as mounted to the
crank.  I cannot see enough strength in the belt or the plastic timing belt
cover to allow, say, a sufficient hard foreign object caught there to take a
chunk out of the sprocket.

On another note, I spoke with Dave Moore who is our area's service rep. 
Although there is neither a recall nor a service action, his advice is that
owners of 944S upgrade their cam belt to the latest version (.02).  This is the
same belt being used in the 944S2, and according to Dave has been made
significantly stronger internally than the .00 belt which PCNA put in cars per
the original recall.  This was all on the record and for attribution, btw.

I'd appreciate any further info anyone out there has (Frank, George?).  I don't
know of any source of info on exactly what differences exist between versions of
parts - it would be most useful!  Maybe if I snuck into Weissach really late one
night...  I would definitely encourage 944-series owners to have not only their
cam belts, but all the components the belt touches periodically checked for
wear.

Hi everybody,

My first posting, so please take it easy on me.

I have a '75 911S with a '78 SC engine. 

Well, a few questions:

1. I bought the car couple of weeks ago.  The engine had
just been worked on(picked it up from the shop, bill amount:$4500).
All together I paid $9700. Has the tail, carrera tensioners, sunroof,
newer wheels, lowered, ...  Now was this an O.K deal or not?

2. Now after the mechanic re-adjusted the valves( 300 miles), they ping
a bit on acceleration arround 3000-4000 rpm.  The timming is right. 
Is this O.K?

3. I put a bottle of octane booster in it, and a couple of days later,
the engine died on slow speeds.  To recover, I had to turn the key to
OFF and back to ON (clutch engaged) to get the engine going again.  
I am filling the tank up everyday and its almost not doing it anymore.
Now does the fuel system not like these octane boosters or is it 
something serious?

Well, that is it for now.  I'll be looking forward to your responses.

Thank you.

I don't know about differences between the belts, except that they get over
$150 (!) for the .02 belt, and no one but the dealers have them. I just
replaced my belt a few months ago (I had a balance shaft seal leak, and
replaced both belts because I was worried about the possibility of oil
damage to the belts). I went for the .02 belt from the dealer, despite
the price, due primarily to paranoia about timing belts in these cars,
and Kevin's experience. I am very glad I did, based on this report.

I am very interested in the sprocket damage. The sprocket in my car was
polished all over (not surprising), but I didn't see any evidence of
the kinds of things Kevin mentioned. It is hard to get a mental picture
from the verbal descriptions, however. Kevin. I wonder if it might be
possible for you to shoot a few pictures in the salient features of
the sprocket and send me some copies. I suspect that other 944S owners
might be interested as well, and with pictures we might be able to get
the insights of Bruce Anderson or other PCA cognisenti. I would really
like to know for sure what represents "normal wear" and what indicates
the possibility of belt damage in examining a used sprocket. I know
that the reason they put 16 valves in these cars is to have more
valves to bend when (not if) the belt breaks, but I still plan to
struggle valiantly.

Depends on a few things: what engine work was done, I'm usually 
a little concerned when an engine gets major work done and then
the car is sold.

Sounds like a good price.  However, I hope you got your own mechanic
to look at it first.
*****

2. Now after the mechanic re-adjusted the valves( 300 miles), they ping
a bit on acceleration arround 3000-4000 rpm.  The timming is right. 
Is this O.K?

*****
NO!  It is **NEVER** okay to hear pinging from a 911 engine!  (it can
also be very expensive)

My car (1980 911sc) does not ping w/ unleaded regular (no, that's not
what I normally use).  It does have different fuel injection than the
 '78 engine.  On the other hand, your engine is lower compression 
(8.5 vs. 9.3) so it should ping less, well maybe not, since the '80 
has the oxy sensor and keeps the mixture correct.

I would GUESS that there is some carbon buildup in your engine.  It is
also possible that you are running lean.  Are you SURE it is timed 
correctly?

I seem to recall that Anderson discusses a method of chemically removing
carbon from a 911 engine in the "911 Performance Handbook."  If you don't
have this book yet buy it now.  There was a particular SWEPCO fuel injector
cleaner that gets poured through the air intake with the engine running 
and is then left overnight (this is a little vague, sorry).

Also, remove one of your plugs and check the color.  If they are light,
or white, instead of a more chocolate color, you are probably running 
lean.
*****

3. I put a bottle of octane booster in it, and a couple of days later,
the engine died on slow speeds.  To recover, I had to turn the key to
OFF and back to ON (clutch engaged) to get the engine going again.  
I am filling the tank up everyday and its almost not doing it anymore.
                                                           ^^
*****
Not doing what?  Pinging or dying?
*****

Now does the fuel system not like these octane boosters or is it 
something serious?

*****
My concern is that I've never heard of an SC engine that needed
octane booster.  Are you sure it is an SC engine?  The '78-'79
911sc engine is a type 930/06 (california, not sure about US & ROW).
The type number is located forward (relative to car, i.e. deeper
into engine compartment) of the right fan support on the horizontal
part of the case.  I usually need a flashlight and a rag to read it.
*****


Sean,  I hope you find (and eliminate) this ping.  It sounds like your
car should be a lot of fun.  The SC engines are damn near bulletproof
as long as they are maintained well (200k+ life expectance).

Enjoy.

I too have a 911SC (83 Euro) and have had a ping at 4000RPM in hot
weather since I bought the car in 85.  Various mechanics have given me
one of two stories, ie. the Euro engince will ping a bit since it has
a higher compression than can be handled by US gasoline, and that an
SC engine should never ping.  In any case noone has been able to tune
it (the ping) out.  It only happens when the engine is hot an the
ambient air is also hot (over 75F).  I drive from a hot valley (San
Jose) over a pass into cool coastal air (60F) every weekday eve and
experience this on a regular basis.  I've discusses this with Bruce
Anderson and the crew that was once Garretson's and Bruce said if I
remember correctly that I could expect this from the Euro engine.

I would appreciate any info anyone has out there on this subject.

Also, I can attest to the 911SC being bulletproff, mine just turnes
over 200K, quite appropriately, while on the morning commute over the
Santa Cruz mountains.  The only apparent problem is it is getting a
little hard to tune for a decent idle, mechanic says the FI System is
getting too worn.

PS: I use only 92 Octane (BP, Shell, U76) and the Swepco additive.

Subject: 911SC pinging


I too have pinging in my 911SC. It's an 83 (CA spec) with 130k
miles.  It seems to do it in any weather, but only when the 
engine temp puts the needle at horizontal or a little below.

I'll notice it when getting on the freeway, at around 4,000 RPM.  
Pinging stops when I stop accelerating. (Pinging is intermitent, 
and I always back off when I hear it.)

I run Chevron Supreme (92 Octane), and I add a bottle of Swepco 503
every four or five tankfulls.

I assume the problem is carbon buildup.  I want to try Bruce Anderson's 
"Swepco through the vacuum line" trick, except I have two distributor 
vacuum lines (blue and red), and I don't know which to use.

I too have idle problems.  When the car is cold, idle is around
750 RPM.  When warm or hot, it is around 1200 RPM.

Subject: Pinging 911


Last year I rebuilt my 79 911SC using the 9.8 Euro pistons. I was told that
it will run happily on 92 octane gas. So far I have no problems with
pinging even when the temperature is very high (31 C). I use the high octane
fuel I can get my hands on, which happens to be Sunoco 94, and Cheveron
techron every 6000 km. Even full throttle on hot days causes no problems.

Perhaps it is possible to experiment with the heat range of the plugs
to prevent pre-ignition or maybe there is carbon in your engine. I
guess the key also is to keep your engine temp down. 

BTW, has anyone had experiences with spoiler mounted oil coolers and
their effectiveness?  I really like the RUF front spoiler/oil cooler
set-up but the spoiler alone costs $850 US. Are there any cheaper RUF
spoiler look alikes? without spoiling my bank account?


Cheers

Sugi

Frank -

I indeed do plan to photograph the sprocket (and belt), and will be happy to
pass a copy along to you.  This is contingent on the owner's not wanting it
back.  He should have picked up the car today, and I'll find out tomorrow. 
Sorry for the frailty of words.  I am kind of doubtful that Bruce A. will have
much to suggest - his '83 944 seems to be absolutely and maddeningly
bulletproof!  I do plan to speak with Charlie Learoyd and the new 944 fellow on
the nat'l committee (sorry, forgotten his name).

(I already snarfed one each of the owner's intake and exhaust valves.  I blasted
them, and they're now part of my office toy collection.  These guys were
*really* whacked.  They looked like they were made of wax and had been left in
the sun.)

I too lack a good idea of what is and is not acceptable wear in the sprocket.  I
don't know of any run-out spec for them.  The scalloping certainly looked
incorrect.  Steve Ross today asked the dealer mechanic, Andy Grignon, who
repaired my own failure if he remembered any particular sprocket malaise.  He
did not.  He was asked by PCNA at the time to replace anything and everything
that the timing belt touched: sprockets, pulleys, whatnot; and so he did.

One theory is that the failures are due not to the belt, but to sprocket wear. 
As the teeth wear down, the belt has a chance to jump a tooth.  This leads to
the chain of bad things which culiminates in a radical cash-ectomy.  Earlier on,
there were apparently problems with the idler pulleys in 944-series cars.

The cam sprocket is apparently quite cheap, like in the $20 - $30 range.  More
cheap insurance?  How much can we afford!

My '81 Euro SC used to have this problem. Same symptoms, etc. Turned out
to be fixable. First thing to check is the injector seals, both of them.
And the rest of the air path seals. Leakage there will cause the car to
run lean, hence ping. Second thing was to check for exhaust leaks, particularly
at the head. Finally, the magic adjustment. I don't know the particulars of
what was done here, but my CO is now 2-5% and the timing was changed a bit.
No more problems, even with the AC on in the summer.

Congrats! I just turned 245,000 KM (~150K miles).

I still use 101 or 106 octane gas for driving schools, just in case. But
for street and autox I only use Chevron 92 octane. No additives. It already
has Techroline.

Subject: Gas

Several comments have been distributed recently concerning gasoline in 911s as
it relates to pinging.  A few have implied 90+ octane has something to do with
150k+ miles on 911SC engines.  My 84 944 owners manual says regular gas is
fine; meaning I believe about 87 octane.  A recent conversation at my Porsche
dealer I was told they are recommending only premium gasoline be used in any
and all Porsches not so much because of the octane but the additives.

This sounds like a topic which should have been soundly thrashed out on the
network but I don't remember reading it yet.  My 944 seems quite happy with
regular OCTANE but premium BRAND gasoline.  Am I setting myself up for a
problem later or are those using 92 octane simply throwing money away?  Do
premium BRANDS add all those important trace elements only to their premium
octanes? I know there are differences between 911s and 944 and in their
various incarnations but there are also some generic questions about
gasolines.

Any thoughts?  Any knowledge?  We all have experience with gasoline!!

While we're on it, what's the view on lubricants and oil fortifiers? I have
seen some very convincing real life demonstrations of an oil fortifier that
boosts film strength without altering viscosity. ( A 35 degree drop in
operating temperature of a gearbox on a friend's truck, increased horsepower
measured on a dynamometer -not a hollow claim, lower amp. readings on
electrically powered equipment etc. plus a very convincing demo with a Timken
tester) Anyway, the engineers tell real believable stories claiming that the
differences between major brand motor oils are trivial OR substantial. Has
anybody separated the facts from the fiction on this issue? I suspect the
gasoline story is similar. Meanwhile, I'll stick to major-brand-high-octane-
*premium* fuels and Valvoline oils.  The oil fortifier seems to work great, but
so do the scare tactics of the engineers working for the oil companies when
they try to steer us away from tampering with their oils.

I wrote the following to a different list some time ago.  To avoid pontificating
again, I'll just re-use the prior soliloquy!

---------------------

Someone asked a while ago about experiences with Slick 50.  At the time, I had
heard of an analysis of the stuff done by a local club member and chemical
engineer.  Since he hadn't published his results, I didn't say anything then.

I now have a copy of his report.  What he did was take three samples of Al/Si
alloy in three matrices: 1. oil, 2. 80% oil, 20% Slick 50, 3. 100% Slick 50. 
The oil was 70W base oil, and had a bit of water added, in 500:1 ratio, to
simulate moisture accumulation.  The matrices were heated at 300F for 5-10
minutes, then at 575F for 10 minutes.  The result solutions were run through a
spectrometer, and the foils were cleaned and re-weighed.

Briefly, what he found was that the Slick 50-containing matrices (2 and 3)
consumed significant silicon from the alloy (and from the pyrex equipment). 
They did not consume aluminum.  The silicon was probably chemically acted upon
by hydrofluoric acid, which must have come from the Slick 50.  The oil-only
matrix (1) had no loss of silicon from the foil or gain in the result.

One remark he makes in the report is that, while your engine doesn't get this
hot, there is no guarantee that this sort of reaction doesn't occur at lower
temperatures as well.

I am not a chemical engineer; please don't kill the messenger!

------------------------

The guy's name, by the way, is Dion Tsouridas.  I ran into him last week.  He
told me then that he had left some of the stuff in a Pyrex beaker.  In due
course, it apparently leeched enough silicon from the glass to cause the glass
to deteriorate!

The other relevent data point came from talking with a local PCA'er who works
for Shell or Exxon (I've forgotten...).  He told me that the oil companies
basically compete on the basis of their additive packages.  That is to say, if
there were different additives that could be added to motor oil and would
testably improve it and differentiate them in the market, the biggies would be
doing so and advertising the heck out of it.  Commodity marketplace.  This, he
says, is true of their premium product lines, but not of their "price leaders."

I would avoid additives to oil.  Techron seems to be the only worthwhile
addition to gasoline.  Why there is a useful aftermarket additive to gas and not
oil is an interesting question!  I would expect the same laws of the marketplace
to apply.  Anyone have a theory?

Hi again,

Thanks for all the responses regarding the ping in the '78SC.
For now I'm putting Chevron 92 everyday to get rid of the old
gas and see if the ping goes away.

Anyways, last night I put an ignition kill switch on the car
which disconnects the coil.  Right now it's in the tunnel
opening behind the hand brake.  I don't trust the alarm kills
somehow.  Has anyone else done this? (differently).  I guess I
could have done it behind the ignition key but that would be
too obvious.

Another question:
I noticed some oil on the bottom of the fan housing. Serious?

How many people here do their own work on their porsche (minor/
major)

Well, that's it for now.

Stuart,

	I have some interesting information about Slick 50......I
It seems that it has determental effects on the engine, especially the
cylinder liners.  Apparently it eats aways Silicone.   Which is really
bad.  (I guess it contains hydrofluoric acid.)

I'm trying to disassemble my 914 CV joints for cleaning/inspection and
can't get the circlip off the end of the halfshaft.  I bought snap ring

Subject: Roll bars again

A few months back I inquired about a bolt-in (in the rear seat belt
points) roll bar for my '87 944 turbo.  Fortunately I was talked out of
it and decided to wait until I was prepared to cut holes in my precious
baby...

I'm now prepared.  I'm getting much faster and it looks like this track
thing is going to last (and not end up as yet another phase...).

Has anyone out there bought an Autopower bar and installed it
themselves? How well do they fit?  Most everyone I've talked to at the
track has had the installation done for them or even had a custom bar
fabricated. I'd like to do this the cheapest way possible (as long as
it's not unreasonably 'hard'). Is this something I should attempt, or
should I bite the bullet and pay someone to install it?

Subject: Re:  CV joint circlip removal?

I got a pair of snap ring pliers from Sears with replacable tips that works
great.  There are about three different diameters of tips - use the biggest
one.  It helps to spin the circlip around the end of this shaft as you are
spreading it - this helps alleviate any binding that may be occuring.

I think that silicon-consuming products would be of
particular interest to Porsche owners.  We have pistons and
cylinders made of Alusil and Nikasil.

Thanks to Jeff and Chris for tips about getting the CV joint circlip
off!

Next inevitable question:  Now that I've gotten a joint off and
disassembled, how much wear is acceptable?  Some of the polished spots
where the balls articulate in both the inner and outer cage are worn
enough to feel with my finger.

and, of course the next inevitable question:  Anyone happen to know who
is likely to have the best price on 914 CV joints?

thanks a million,

re oils and additives.

I have always used in mobil 1 in my SC and in my mini race car.  It appears to
work quite well.

I recently last week changed my transaxle oil to Redline.  My 915 gearbox 
could probably use a rebuild and has been shifting somewhat balkily.  Since
the redline was added, it shifts MUCH better.

Someone I know who has a Jeep claims he has run Slick50 for years
and is approaching 200K miles with no problems.  Given that they
have cast iron blocks, immune to silicone deteriation, one would
think the silicone seals would be harmed?

Good question; I'd like to know the answer myself.  I think a little polishing
is OK.  You have to watch out for deeper grooves, which are responsible for
clicking noises.

But perhaps someone (hey there George!) can inform as to how deep is too deep,
and what failure modes to expect from overworn CV's.

Subject: re CV joint circlip removal

If the CV joints are like some 911 CV joints I have taken apart, there is
a concave spring washer preloading the CV joint against the circlip.

This makes it difficult to get the circlip off/on.

To compress the spring washers, I used two long pieces of threaded rod,
with 4 nuts/washers, to work like coil spring compressors.

Run the threaded rod through the CV joint mounting holes from end to end
and wrench them tight until the washers are compressed.  Remove and re-install
one CV joint at a time.

I have noticed the following fluctuations in the oil pressure of my 87 944T
over the past year:
One year ago the oil pressure gauge was over 5 bar. After driving in
the highway the oil pressure was down to 4.5 bar. Throughout the year
things have changed slightly. Now the pressure, during normal driving, is
above 4.5 bar, and the idle pressure is fluctuating between 2.5 and 3.0 bar.
The owners manual indicates that normal idle pressure (always after driving)
should be higher than 3.5. I've checked the maintenance manuals and they 
indicate that at oil temperature of 80C (measured with temperature tester) 
and engine speed of 4,000rpm, oil pressure should be around 4.5, and 2.5 at idle
(both measured with appropriate oil pressure tester).
The question I have is if I should worry about this oil pressure drop.
I am still within the specs (provided that the oil pressure gauge in the
panel indicates the correct pressure), but I want to find out about this
pressure fluctuation over the past year.

thanks in advance,

hi - '69 912/Solex P11-4/1750cc NPR here..

i just got some plugs from Tweeks today - Bosch W6BC - and put them in.
the old plugs were Bosch W5AC.

what's the difference between the W6BC and the W5AC?? i suspect they're
a different heat range (but it so, which is the hotter?).

thanks...

My 86 would peg 5 cruising on the street.  At the track they all seem to
drop to 4 bar - some below, and idle shy of 2 after a hot run session.

I never liked it and would bring it in when it dropped below 4 at 5000
rpm.

Rod bearings were checked and replaced anually and did not show and
degredation.

I don't know the answer, but you are not alone.  My mechanic said 3.5
was a reasonable cut off to bring it in, but having lost a motor in'90 I
didn't want to push it.   Mobil 1 15W50 was used.

> While we're on it, what's the view on lubricants and oil fortifiers? 

Ah, the $64k question.... Experience indicates the answer is "it depends".
For example, take PetroMoly, a multigrade oil of mixed parentage (natural
as well as synth) plus some moly disulfide in suspension for grins. In 
the tow vehicle, it has cut down oil consumption, increased gas milage and
reduced operating temperature. Good stuff, right? Well, on that theory we
tried it in the 911 (IMSA GTU) it was towing, where it burned out the 
main and camshaft bearings in 1/2 hour of testing. Final analysis: the size
of the moly particulate *REALLY MATTERED* and ate the 911 bearings like
candy but slipped by the looser tolerances of the Chevy with no problem.

Another example: STP. It really, really seems to help tired old Detroit
V8s get a little further down the road. But consider: it's basicly 75W
oil. It sinks to the bottom of the crank case when the engine is cold as
it's only carried in a semi-colloidial suspension in the hot oil. So, what's 
the first thing that your oil pump sump pickup sees? Cold 75W STP. What
happens when you pump that through your oil cooler? Well, it stretches or
just explodes, depending. I've seen both happen. Note well that Detroit iron
doesn't have oil coolers.

The Official Stan Plan: use high-grade oil, no additives. Change every
3000 miles in the street cars. Change every race or every other autox
in the competition cars. If it isn't driven often, change every 3 months
regardless of milage. Use synthetics for manual transmissions and differentials
(if different) and other places where high shear loads are found. Use
synthetics in the 911 only if someone else is paying for it 8{). 

We have a Valvoline sponsorship, so I'm supposed to say nice things about 
them.  I use their oil, but am less than enchanted since I discovered that I 
can buy it in 5-case quantity chaper via a local contact than through their 
sponsorship program. I gotta stop letting the other guys on the team negotiate 
these bum deals...

Subject: CV joint wear - how much is OK ?


   Next inevitable question:  Now that I've gotten a joint off and
   disassembled, how much wear is acceptable?  Some of the polished spots
   where the balls articulate in both the inner and outer cage are worn
   enough to feel with my finger.

Polishing is OK, but if there is a groove that you can feel, it must
be changed.  When you reassemble you will be putting it together
slightly differently and the new path the ball will want to take will
not be in exactly the same place, thus the groove will cause the ball
to disintegrate.  Also, any balls with a bluish tinge should be
replaced - this is not some old wives tale as suggested previously,
anyone who knows anything about metals can tell you the bluing is an
indication that the properties of the metal have changed from over
heating, and the ball is likely to behave differently than the others,
typically causing deformations in the ball and/or disintegration.

These are all what we used to call "hundred thousand mile"
considerations, the parts will probably last a while if you don't
change them, the CV joint is made of the highest strength materials.
However, any old car should not ignore these things because you may
well already have passed "last a while", and be on "fail any time now"

I agree with Christopher Welty's assessment.

If you can feel a groove, more than polishing, you're going to have
to replace it soon enough anyway, why not do it while you've got it
all apart already.  (The groove will eventually cause clicking or
vibration; then you're going to have to try to remember which of the
four was the one that was most badly worn.)  While you're at it, change
the boots that are cracked or ready to give out.

Bottom line: Doing it right the first time saves money and aggravation.

WOW $800, Thats a lot!

The owner of the shop that painted my car, John Cato order the
Ruf look alike from a local place here in San Diego called 
Dillengers (619) 268-9700.  I am not sure of the price because
I payed for it plus painting. The air dam I am talking about
has two round holes for brake cooling and a large rectangle in
the center for an oil cooler. I think it is around $380.

A few quick questions for those of you in the know...
1) I am going to buy a good torque wrench. Most all of my tools are Craftsman
but I'm hesitating on buying their Microtorque wrench for $90. I like their
return policy and I could always return the wrench if I ever felt it was out
of adjustment but should I check out Snap-On etc.. Also, what torque range is
best? It seems that the 200Nm+ wrenches are not as accurate at 10Nm.

2) Has anyone found a good price on 944 Factory Manuals recently?

3) Has anyone considered video taping a tech session for their PCA region. For
example if you were going to do a 944 Timing Belt Clinic, have someone bring
their home video camera and record the procedure for prosperity. I know that
I sure would like to see a tape of a fairly complex procedure before I started
the job myself. Just an idea.  

Thanks,
Blaine

Thanks for the info.

The RUF spoiler I am thinking of is the newer type with a narrower,
longer opening for the oil cooler and two openings for fog lamps.
You might have seen it in the RUF/Exclusive Motor Cars ad in Excellence.
I like it because it looks very low-key. I guess it is expensive because
it is made of PURIM instead of fiberglass in order to be indestructable.

Coincidently, I received the Tweeks catalog yesterday and it contained the
RUF style spoiler for the 930 made out of fiberglass ($400). They said it
will be also coming out in polyurethane soon. I wonder if it can be
modified at the edges to fit the 911SC?

In any case, I am in no hurry since I plan to add the oil cooler and
spoiler only next year. I will also give Dillengers a call to see if they
have anything similar.


Cheers

*******

I have a craftsman (microtorque?) ratcheting torque wrench.  I paid about
$50 a year ago.

Generally, the feeling I've had for the past few years is that the 
craftsman tools are not what they used to be.

I hope you are aware that there is a 1 (one) year, not (NOT) a lifetime
guarantee on the torque wrench.

I would definately not pay $90 for the one I have.

As far as what range, you will probably need two.  One that will work over
(about) 50 ft-lb and one below about 20 ft-lb.

I mostly use mine for my lug nuts, so...

If I were buying another one, I would get the $23 special from imparts.

Torque Wrenches are most accurate in the middle of their range. Thus, if you 
need to do some torques of 10NM and others of 80NM you might be best off with 2 
wrenches.

Don't trust a Torque wrench near it's extremes.

i can't speak to the porsche application directly, but ...

    Has anyone out there bought an Autopower bar and installed it
    themselves? How well do they fit?

the autopower cage i saw in stalled in an Alfa GTV-6 went in very
nicely; good fit and the installer liked the cage.

     Most everyone I've talked to at the
    track has had the installation done for them or even had a custom bar
    fabricated. I'd like to do this the cheapest way possible (as long as
    it's not unreasonably 'hard'). Is this something I should attempt, or
    should I bite the bullet and pay someone to install it?

there is an article on cage installation in the most recent
issue of _Grassroots Motorsports_ that may be of interest.  one
hint i can give you:  if you do have an installer do it for you,
remove the back seat and carpet before you give the car to him;
it will save a lot of time.

Subject: Gas Tank Restoration


Has anyone have any experience with rebuilding a gas tank?  There's
a national company that markets a process/product called 'Gas Tank Renu'.
Essentially, they flush, sand? blast, and line the tank with a vinyl
chemical, also they coat the exterior.

For my 912, it costs $160.  I saw a few 911 tanks there already rebuilt,
they look like new.  They are supposedly safe for gas/diesel, high octane,
methanol and alcohol.  This is much less than a new tank and I'd rather
not inherit someone else's used tank.

David -

I have heard on a bunch of occassions that the Ruf airdam is a really superior
part, in terms of its fit and finish and ease of installation.  There are a lot
of other aftermarket non-metal dams and flairs which typically take skill, time,
and cursing to get a good fit.  Or so I am told.

Folks,

Someone commented on the inaccuracy of torque wrenches at their extrema.  Dunno
myself.  There is a terrific article in the new European Cars magazine on the
angle-torquing method, and by way of contrast the weaknesses of traditional
torquing.  (There is also a great review of lambda sensor theory and practice,
and a so-so article on 911 tie rod updating.  This magazine is really terrific.)

I use a Sears Craftsman 20 - 150 ftlb microtorque, which I recall costing me
about $45.00 a couple years ago.  Unless you are rebuilding an engine, this guy
will serve close to 100% of your needs.  I also bought a 25 - 250 inch-pound
wrench last year, but mostly just to piss Jim Selders off by torquing his or my
brake calliper bleeders to spec!  Actually, I do put it to occassional real use.

My first 20 - 150 model failed after a couple years ownership, only because the
nut which gets loosened to callibrate it had backed all the way out.  I took it
to the local Sears, without a sales receipt, and the salesman offered to either
send it out for repair or give me a brand new one.  I took the new one, since I
had immediate need.  Your mileage may vary, but they've never quibbled about the
one-year vs. lifetime thing to me.

Mounting a fire extinguisher

To participate in PCA driver's education events, you'll have
to invest in two pieces of equipment.  One is a helmet, the
other is a fire extinguisher.  As Jim Selders mentioned in
his article last month, we've made it a little easier for
first-timers this year by waiving the extinguisher
requirement at their first event.  We want to encourage as
many of you as possible to come out and join us at these
very enjoyable events.

I started doing track events myself a few years ago.  Like
most of you, the thought of drilling holes in my Porsche was
not a pleasant one!  Moreover, a friend who had recently
installed his own extinguisher had managed to just miss
drilling a fuel line.  I decided to come up with a slightly
better mousetrap.  After a few iterations, I think I have a
set-up that works pretty well without requiring any nasty
holes.

There those of you whose idea of fun and relaxation does not
include working on your own Porsche.  Your favorite mechanic
can certainly duplicate or improve on what I describe below,
and for not a lot of money.


  A few preliminaries

We require that the extinguisher you put in your car carry a
charge of at least 2.5 pounds.  It must also have a metal
bracket, and be mounted securely to a metal component of the
existing car.  The mounting fasteners should be bolts and
nuts; self-tapping or wood screws are not acceptable.
Beyond these ground rules, I can offer a few words of
optional advice - take it or leave it.

Halon extinguishers have been preferred by owners because
when used they do not leave behind a residue which can ruin
an engine or its wiring [qualify], nor will it harm leather
or fabric.  More recently, the ecologic and health hazards
of Halon have become better recognized, and some owners are
trading off what they feel is the lesser of two evils.

Look for an extinguisher with a metal nozzle rather than a
plastic one.  It is less likely to ever become damaged, and
will not melt in the presence of heat.

When you choose a mounting location for your extinguisher,
keep a few things in mind.  First off, mount it where, if it
were ever to accidentally come loose, it is less likely to
hurt you or interfere with your ability to control the car.
This rules out the driver footwell for me, and I decided to
mount it as low as possible in the cabin.

Consider that, knock wood, if you ever do need the thing,
your frame of mind may be a bit less that perfect.  Or you
may be hurt.  Make the extinguisher as accessible as you
can.  Some people mount them in the right rear seat's
footwell, or on the bolster between the rear seats.  Under
the best of circumstances, getting to it in one of these
places requires a bit of contortion.  In a five-point
harness, impossible.  That left one location to my mind: the
front passenger footwell.

Finally, mount the extinguisher with the nozzle aimed at the
floor or wall.  I don't know of one which has ever
accidentally discharged, but what they hey.


  How I did it

So I want to mount my extinguisher in my passenger's
footwell.  I would prefer no holes in my carpet or floor.
And since my family frequently rides along with me, I wanted
to avoid interfering with their comfort.  What I decided on
was a bracket which would fasten to the passenger seat's
rails.  As you can see in the picture, the extinguisher is
below seat level and really doesn't get in a passenger's
way.

The construction was simple.  I picked up two kinds of
extruded, anodized aluminum stock at Somerville Lumber.  The
first is angle stock, 3/4" x 3/4" x 1/8" thick.  The second
is flat stock, 3/4" x 1/8".  This stuff is light, strong,
and very easy to cut and drill.  It looks good too.  The
angle stock was used to make two L-shaped pieces which mount
to the top chair rails.  The flat stock was used to span
their tops and mount the extinguisher's bracket.  I used
some 8-32 and 1/4" bolts, lock washers, and nuts to put it
all together.

Some of the following numbers and details will vary
depending on your car.  Mine is an '87 944S, and I have the
factory sport seats.

Start by making the L-shaped pieces (Figure 1).  The long
leg will be fastened horizontally to the top seat rail,
allowing the extinguisher to move forward and back with the
seat.  The 12.3 mm length of this leg is the critical
dimension.  It is long enough for the bracket to clear the
seat front, yet short enough so that it does not interfere
with the two seat adjustment levers at the front of the
seat.

Rather than cutting two pieces with 45 degree ends and
trying to line them up, cut a V-shape out of a single piece
as shown in the Figure 2.  I found it easier to cut it free-
hand than with a miter box.  Bend the piece into its L
shape.  Secure it with a trapezoidal piece of the flat stock
at the bend, held in place with an 8-32 bolt, lock washer,
and nut in each leg.  Deburr all cut edges, and round the
corners of the short leg so they cannot snag the seat.

Measure the distance between the centers of your two seat
rails, then cut a length of flat stock that width plus 3/4".
Drill 1/4" holes at each end of it, spaced in 3/8".  Drill
holes in it to center your extinguisher's bracket as well.
Drill 1/4" holes in both legs of the L's 3/8" from the end,
and fasten the cross piece to the short legs.  Use the 1/4"
bolts here and to fasten the extinguisher bracket.  Attach
the L's "inside out" so that they don't interfere with the
seat's side skirts.

Now you'll have to pull your seat out of the car to drill a
hole in the top rail on each side.  In my car, the seat is
fastened to the floor by six allen head M6 bolts: three on
each side, one in front and two at the rear.  You can get to
them best by moving the seat to the limits of its travel.
If you have seat motors, reach under and unplug the wiring
harness.  Lay a drop cloth across the door threshold before
hoisting the seat out, to protect the paint from scratching
it with the rails.  Lay the seat on its back on the ground,
and drill 1/4" holes in the top rails to mate the L's.

Putting the seat back in the car, be careful with the bolts.
They're very easy to cross-thread.  Thread the bolts back in
by hand, but leave them loose until all six are threaded and
turning freely.  Then tighten them down, being careful not
to overtorque.

When the seat's back in the car, slide it forward a bit and
fasten the bracket to it.  You're done.  For extra credit,
you can add an additional support for the bottom end of
extinguisher.  Cut about a five inch length of flat stock,
and bend it to bolt to the cross-piece and support the
extinguisher.

I find describing this project in words a bit cumbersome.
If any of you would like to see this bracket up close,
please feel free to give me a call and swing by my home some
week-end day.

Tech Tips

I joined a bevy of fellow NER/PCA'ers in taking part in the
Porsche clinic sponsored by Clair Porsche and PCNA on April
25th and 26th.  This was a terrific opportunity to get your
oil changed, fluids topped off, and have the car checked
over by Clair's staff, all for free.  I also had the chance
to shoot the breeze with Clair service manager Tom Shanahan
and PCNA service rep Dave Moore.


  911 A/C Condenser Fan Fuse

In '88, Porsche issued a tech bulletin recommending that an
additional fuse be added in-line to protect the wiring to
the air conditioning condenser fan. 911's produced as of
March of that year had the fuse built in.  The fan is
located in the nose of the car.  There is some risk of
chafing and shorting of the wire delivering +12 volts to the
fan, and the 15 amp fuse back in the fuse panel is a little
too generous.

Porsche came up with a 7.5 amp fuse in a in-line holder.
The connectors on the wires to and from this holder just
plug right into the existing circuit - no tools needed.  The
part number is 911.612.077.00.  Cheap insurance, as the
saying goes.  If you own a 911 lacking this, you would do
well to add it.

Thanks to Tom for this tip.


  944S Timing Belt

Early in 1988, Porsche issued a service action for the '87
and '88 944S.  They were dissatisfied with the quality of
the cam timing belt currently used in production.  Cars
received a new belt manufactured by Pirelli (part number
944.105.323.00), replacing the original belt, which had been
manufactured by Goodyear if memory serves.

It came to my attention recently that Porsche has since
twice updated this belt's design.  The latest version is
used in both 944S and 944S2 models, and is part number
944.105.323.02.  I asked Dave Moore what design changes had
gone into it.  He told me that the current version has been
substantially strengthened internally.  He also recommends
that any 944S owners with an earlier version of the belt
update to the newest version.

I would add to this by recommending that, any time your
mechanic inspects or retensions the belt, he check carefully
the sprockets and pulleys on which the belt rides.  The
sprockets can wear, and beyond an uncertain point there is
the chance of the belt skipping a tooth.

Wire gauges

Porsche's wiring diagrams spell out the gauge of wire to be
used in a given circuit, in units of square millimeters.
The following chart, willfully purloined from the Wurth
corporation, will help you convert from millimeters to the
AWG sizes available here in the US.

                2
   gauge      mm

     20        .5
     18        .75
     16       1.0
     14       1.5
     12       2.5
     11       4.0
     10       6.0
      8      10.0
      6      16.0
      4      25.0
      2      35.0
      1      50.0
    2/0      70.0
    3/0      95.0
    4/0     120.0

944-series Spec Books

Porsche publishes a series of little Technical Specification
books for various models.  Alas, the only one available for
the 944-series cars has until recently been one for model
year '82 and '83.  Porsche has at last corrected this
situation with the two booklettes pictured here.  Their part
numbers are:

     WKD 423 320    for the 924S, 944 booklet, and
     WKD 423 520    for the 944S, 944S2, and 944 turbo booklette

These pocket-sized gems are packed with all the numeric
specifications you find in the full-blown workshop manuals:
fastening torques, wear limits, engine specifications,
dimensions, you name it.  What you give up are the exploded
diagrams and step-by-steps procedures that you find in the
workshop manuals.

These booklettes are an excellent value, and I recommend
them to anyone maintaining his or her own Porsche.

944-series water heater valve

Pictured here is a device which has vexed a number of 944
owners.  It is a heater valve, and it controls the rate of
flow of engine coolant through the cabin heater core.  The
thermostat in the cabin and the setting of the cabin
temperature dial combine to apply the right amount of vacuum
via a hose hooked to the diaphragm part of the heater valve.
The diaphragm control the linkage to the bottom part, which
opens correspondingly to allow more or less flow of engine
coolant through the cabin heater core.

Through model year '86, this heater valve was located at the
back of the engine, that is, between the fire wall and the
engine.  I believe that starting with model year '87, the
valve was moved in all models to the other end of the
engine, right next to the oil filter.  This is certainly the
case for my '87 944S and for the 944 Turbo we worked on at
the recent 944 Tech Session.

Why did Porsche move the valve?  Well, I have a theory...
These guys tend to eventually leak coolant.  Unfortunately,
in their original position, this coolant could very easily
drip right into the bell housing around the clutch.  This
can, and has in several cases, ruin the clutch, requiring
its replacement.  Because of the valve's location, such a
leak might not be at all visible until much too late.  One
944 Turbo owner recently asked me why his clutch was leaking
coolant!

The valve itself is not very expensive.  The part numbers I
have for it are:

     944.572.085.02   for model years 82 through 85
     928.574.573.03   for model years 85-1/2 forward

Check with your Porsche dealer's parts department for the
latest parts revisions.

For those of you with pre-'87 cars, you may wish to consider
relocating the heater valve to its new location.  This would
involve updating the coolant hoses, obviously.  In its new
location, the single hose from the water pump to the heater
pipe is replaced by two short hoses, with the valve spliced
between them.  Given the age of these cars, you may already
want to consider replacing old coolant hoses anyways.  I am
not completely sure that the valve will fit in its new
location, since no-one has to my knowledge moved it.  Worth
a try, though.

For those cars with the heater valve in its new location,
you can catch its failure quite easily.  When it starts
leaking, you'll see white spots of dried coolant on your oil
filter. I recommend periodically checking around the front
of your engine for coolant leaks from the heater valve, and
more importantly, the water pump.

Central Electric Addition

As promised last month, my contribution to this issue will
point the way to adding something to your car's electrical
system.  In particular, we'll describe the task for a late-
model car featuring the type of Central Electrical Board
(CEB) which appeared in the 944- and 928-series cars in the
mid-eighties, and more recently the C2 and C4 series.

The addition I'll describe isn't that useful or thrilling of
itself.  I've taken my radar detector's power supply and
located it under my dash, wired into an existing fused
circuit.  My car is an '87 944S, and some of the details are
specific to it.  What follows is a rather long-winded,
detailed explanation of the steps I took.  The hope is that
you'll pick up enough generic information here that you can
tackle this type of addition to your own car.


Keeping failure in mind

Whenever you modify your car mechanically or electrically,
you have to keep in mind what can go wrong.  It's easy to
think about how everything works when everything works.  But
what happens when something goes wrong?  If I add a wire to
a circuit and it opens up or shorts out, is that going to
shut down the whole car and leave me stranded?

Porsche, Bosch, and I would imagine all car manufacturers
put a lot of effort into making cars reliable.  The best
thing you can do is imitate them, and make your additions
blend into the existing electrical system.  You want to
avoid changing or adding to critical circuits, like the DME.
Keep the "lifestyle" accessories independent of the mission-
critical stuff.


What goes where

My radar detector came with two power supplies.  One plugs
into a cigarette lighter, the other can be wired into the
car's electrical system.  These supplies convert the car's
12 volts to the 9 volts needed by the detector.  Like many
people, I've taken the latter unit and installed it under
the dash in the driver's footwell.  From there, a cable runs
the 9 volts up to and through the fresh air plenum, out one
of its louvres in the dash, and to my detector.

The Central Electrical Board is visible under the hood as
the covered box of relays and fuses.  Looking up while lying
in the driver's footwell, you can see its underside behind a
black plastic shroud.  This shroud can be removed by
unfastening three plastic speednuts with a 9 mm. socket.
The underside of the box receives fourteen connector blocks,
each with either ten or twenty pins in it.  There are also a
number of connector-less circuits wired directly to the
outermost row of relays, typically used for optional
equipment.  Internally, the CEB wires all the connectors,
fuses, relays, and main busses together.

Still lying in the driver-side footwell, you can spot two
ground "mounting points" next to the CEB.  One is easily
seen to the aft of the CEB; this is designated MP II
("mounting point two").  The other is to the side of the CEB
and is partially hidden by the shroud.  This is MP III.  It
pays to get to know where all these points are in your car.
In recent memory, loose and dirty grounds have accounted
quite a few PCA'ers car woes.

     [Photo 37]

To mount the power supply, I drilled a small hole next to MP
II and used a self-tapping screw.  Now on to the wiring.

Wires

Before mounting it, I replaced the two wires coming out of
the power supply.  I wanted the ground wire to be brown like
every other ground wire in a German car.  And I wanted to
remove the in-line fuse from the positive wire, since I
would be using a fused circuit in the CEB.

     [Photo 1]

I crimped a 1/4" ring terminal on the end of the ground
wire, which fit perfectly onto the 6 mm. bolt used to secure
the existing wires to MP II.  Simple enough, but here are a
couple of suggestions.

   - Pull any insulating collar off the ring terminal and
     crimp it twice, side by side, to be sure of as solid a
     connection as possible.  Tug at the wire afterwards to
     double check.

   - Use the right gauge terminal for the wire.  You'll get
     a more secure crimp.

There are two schools of thought on whether or not to solder
as well as crimp.  One one hand, soldering creates a
superior electrical junction.  Over time, it is less
vulnerable to internal corrosion.  On the other hand, solder
creates a mechanically rigid, inflexible junction.  A
crimped junction has a bit of give and will last longer in a
vibrating car.  Since solder has a low melting point, a
soldered junction which runs too much current can melt the
solder, and the flowing solder can wreak havoc.


Plus twelve

Now for the +12.  The first thing is to pick a fused
circuit.  My radar detector is a very low priority item.  I
don't want it or any changes made for it to interfere with,
for example, the car's ignition or DME circuits.  One safe
thing to do is create a new fused circuit.  This was what
Porsche did in the Service Action I described in my article
last month.  Another possibility, and the way I chose to go,
is to extend an existing circuit.  I have a wimpy radio in
my car which nowhere nearly uses the 15 amps its circuit is
rated, through fuse #39.  The radar detector itself uses no
more than 0.5 amp.

How do we add a new client to this circuit?  We will rule
out right away using an "in-line splice" connector onto the
existing +12 wire to the radio.  These horrible little
connectors get power to a new wire by cutting into an
existing wire.  Using this sort of knife-edged connector in
a moving, vibrating car is asking for trouble, in my
opinion.

There are two good ways to add a circuit.  The first is to
run a new wire from the CEB itself.  The other is to daisy-
chain from the end of an existing wire by crimping or
soldering a new wire onto its connector pin.  In the case at
hand, because the power supply is nowhere near the radio,
the simplest thing was to run a new wire from the CEB.

The factory workshop manuals include wiring diagrams for
each model year of a given car.  These diagrams can be
pretty intimidating, but with a little patience you can get
the hang of them.  In the case of the MY87 944-series car, a
study of the radio wiring diagram reveals a buried treasure.

     [Figure 1]

This figure is excerpted from one of my car's schematics.
The dashed line in the inset encloses that part of the
wiring internal to the CEB itself.  There are two junctions
at its edge, marked G13 and F43.  G13, we see, has a 2.5 mm.
red/white wire running to the radio and equalizer.  F43
apparently goes nowhere.  What do these labels mean?

Plugging into the bottom of the CEB are fourteen connectors,
labelled A through O (skipping I).  Each has either two or
four rows of five female pins.  The CEB junction labelled
"G13" denotes connector G, row 1, column 3.  If we look at
that connector, we indeed see a thick red/white wire in that
position.  And if we look at F43, we will find that it has
no wire coming from it - yet!

We can verify this by going to the CEB schematic.  Arranged
around its edge is a breakdown of each connector.  On the
inside is a indication of the circuit, fuse, and/or other
connector pin electrically connected to that pin.  On the
outside is the schematic "map reference" at which that
circuit is used.

     [Figure 3]

This figure excerpts just the part of the CEB schematic for
the F connector.  Notice the pin numbers in the middle row,
11 through 45.  Above it is the "interface" to the CEB, and
the top row of boxed codes are generally the schematic co-
ordinates to which a wire in that pin position leads.  The
bottom row(s) indicate where the CEB internally routes that
pin.  So, for example, pin 11 (the leftmost) has its circuit
(usually a wire leading from it to something) described at
co-ordinate L47 in the schematic set.  Internally, the CEB
connects it to pin 41 on the E connector.  It's a bridge
circuit.

Look over to the right for pin 43.  You can see that it is
nominally wired externally to something at co-ordinate F83
in the schematic set.  This is in fact shown in Figure 1.
Internally, we see that the CEB wires this pin both to fuse
39 ("Si39"), and to pin 13 in the G connector ("G13").
Other pins shown in this  figure are wired to relays and to
main power busses.


Into the CEB

Returning to Figure 1, we see that G13 is being used to
power the radio, but F43 is unused.  F43 looks like a good
place to hook up a new wire to fused circuit 39.  We'll have
to pull out the CEB to add this wire.  This isn't hard.
Start by taking the negative cable off your battery.

Pop the hood, and set aside the CEB cover.  The CEB is held
in place by two mounting screws; unfasten them by hand or
with a screwdriver.  Now grasp the two screws and pull the
CEB up and out of its box.  There are a lot of wires, so
expect some resistance to movement.

     [Photo 28]

I find it useful to lay a pair of paint stirrers across the
lip of the box, then rest the CEB on them, as in the photo.

The next step is to disengage the central locking rail.  It
locks the fourteen connectors in place.  Pull it out until
you feel it unlock; it's unlocked in the above photo.  Now
find connector F.  There are letters along the side of the
CEB showing which connector is where.  Getting the twenty-
pin connectors out is a chore.  Be patient and careful, and
of course don't pull it by the wires.

     [Photo 32]

Once you have the F connector out, you'll notice that it is
really a bank of four rows of five-pin connectors locked
together with a color-coded end piece.  The latter is coded
to the connector's destination so that you cannot, for
example, plug F in where E belongs.  The end-piece is next
to the 4-row; the 1-row is farthest from the colored end.

     [Photo 31]

The female pins in the connectors are of an unusual kind.
There are two sizes available, depending on the gauge of
wire you plan to use.  For this project, the 1.5 mm. size is
quite adequate.  Take one, crimp it onto the end of a length
of wire.  Notice that the pin has a locking barb on its
back.  Route the wire from the driver's footwell out to the
F connector.

Each row of the connector contains plastic pins which lock
the next row's pins in place.  You'll have to disassemble at
least the last row of the F block before inserting the new
pin.  The above photo shows the start of this.  With a small
screwdriver, gently pry one end of the coded end-piece off,
then its other end.  In general, repeat this process to get
to the row you need.  In this case, we're adding to the 4-
row and have only to remove the end-piece.

Before inserting the new pin, notice the front/back
orientation of those already in there.  Insert the new pin
the same way so that its barb engages.  (To get one of these
pins out, first insert a jeweler's screwdriver alongside the
pin in the connector, pushing back this barb.)  Reassemble
the connector block, and re-insert it into the CEB.  If you
find inserting it difficult, a spritz of lubricating contact
cleaner into the connector block will help.  Engage the
central locking rail, and fasten the CEB back in its box.


Final details

When the CEB was pulled out, you probably noticed that there
was enough slack in the harness to allow this.  Be sure to
add no less slack to any wires you add.  The best and
neatest way to do this is to run new wires along the
existing harness bundle.  Secure them to the harness with
cable ties.

The wire you use should be suitable to the electrical
current it will pass.  For this project, 18 gauge wire is
quite adequate.  (If you add wiring in the engine bay,
consider protecting it with sheath tubing.)

Add a female, insulated push-on terminal to the other end of
the new wire from the CEB, and a male push-on to the +12
wire from the detector's power supply.  Connect them, and
you're done.

There you have it.  Like I said, a long-winded explanation
of a not very interesting addition to my car's electrical
system.  I hope that I've at least succeeded in showing how
such an addition can be safely made, and that you're a
little less intimidated by the multi-hued morass of wires
under your dash.

Subject: Torque Wrenches


 It's best to have two torque wrenches. I own a pair of
 Snap-Ons. One is good to about 20ft-lbs and the other to
 just over 100ft-lbs. 

 With a lot of experience it is quite possible to be
 as accurate as a torque wrench however I wouldn't 
 recommend that you do without one.

 Remember that they should be re-calibrated once a year
 (less often if you NEVER loan them out and always back
 off the tension when done with them).

 I believe that it is possible to obtain them from 
 Snap-On with finer resolution heads (eg. more clicks
 per inch of revolution) to allow you to work in tighter
 spaces with them. 

 I highly recommend them. Beautiful tools. I paid about
 $260 for the pair I think.

 BTW, I have found Craftsman tools significantly inferior
 in recent years. I won't consider buying any of their
 wrenches (unless they are destined to be loaners .. :->).

Subject: backspacing on 914s


 I asked this question last year but nobody could give me
 a good answer..

 I want to flare the front and rear fenders on my 914. I
 anticipate flaring the front about 1" and the rear 2".
 I think this is probably a maximum given that I want to
 work with the metal that is there (rather than using those
 cruddy looking 916 fibreglass flares). 

 I want to fit 928 phone dial wheels (probably 6", maybe
 7"). Does anyone know what years/model numbers of wheels
 would fit under such mildly flared fenders and what
 backspacing I should look for. 

 I gather that fitting the front is not a problem (I already
 have Koni struts and 911 calipers for the front). I know
 that 914/6 rear wheel hubs are a bolt-on for the rear.
 
 I'm just having difficulty choosing the right size of wheels..

 thanks in advance,
 Stefan

The 914-6, and therefore, I presume, 914-4's converted to equivalent
914-6's, used the same wheel offset as the bulk of the 911 series
(23.5 mm). Most of the phone dial wheels you will find use the
larger offset required for ABS brakes (52.3 mm for many post '87
944 series, something near 60 mm for most 928's). However, the
1986 944 (at least in the US) used a 7x15 phone dial with 23.5 mm
offset as the standard equipment wheel. The only 6x15 phone dial
wheel I know of came on the 87-88 924S, and it used the 52.3 mm offset
and thus will not fit.

Subject: Carbon buildup on 911 pistons

This is a puzzler for me and the local Porsche mechanic.  At a recent event
at Road America I overcooked one cylinder so badly it melted the electrode
on the spark plug. (1970 914-6, 2.2L E)  When that side of the motor was torn
down, that piston and cylinder were scored.  Apparently that cylinder was
running much to lean, perhaps because one of the carb jets was clogged.
We still haven't figured out the root cause of that problem.  What worries
me even more though, is that the other two pistons on that bank had a heavy
grainy carbon deposit all over the dome.  The car runs rich, but I didn't
think that would cause that much carbon to accumulate on the pistons.  Any
ideas?
Also, does anyone know where I might look to find a single piston and cylinder
(preferably new) for a 2.2L 911E motor (height group 6)  I hate to buy a
whole new set, but it looks like I may have no alternative.  We have looked
just about everywhere, and no one sells singles any more.  Thanks in advance.

Okay, that's easy -- but then why do you want to flare the fenders?
Certainly with 6" wheels, and probably with 7", you shouldn't need to flare
-- unless you're using fairly large-diameter tires, maybe.

I've got 205/50-15's on 8" rims on my 914.  The fronts fit without bending
or adjusting anything.  On the rear, I had to pull out the fenders a little
-- especially the left rear.  The left rear fenderwell is always about 0.5"
narrower than the right rear on a 914.  Really.  Try measuring it.  My
wheels have about 5.25" or 5.3" of backspacing.  They *just* clear the strut
on the front.  Remember that my tires are only marginally wider than my
wheels -- if you were to run a 225 on an 8" rim, you'd need more backspacing
(and might need to flare).

Don't go too wide on the tires.  The 914 is a light car.  Wide tires do look
good, but flares don't, and there is such a thing as too wide.

On the front, you might need to push the tire out a little if you're using
something larger in diameter than a 205/50-15 and it's that wide, because at
full lock, the tires might contact the inside of the fenderwell.  You'll
just have to mount 'em up and try it.  If you do have to push the tires out,
then you may subsequently need to flare.

Good luck.  Let me know what you work out.

Call Sam Shalala at ProTechnik in Houston TX, at (713) 879-8861. He has been 
amazingly able to get pistons in ones and twos -- and claims that some
suppliers *LIKE* to break sets, because then they have broken sets for the
next time someone needs one or two.... Go figure....

BTW, tell him I sent you.

The dialog of last week seemed to get deflected onto Slick-50 from what I
started - gasoline.  I've examined the pumps around here (not all, but many)
and find little overt or consistent about additives.  The pump jockies are
now ensconced behind bars and plexiglas and probably don't know additives from
addition.  Is it possible to learn which BRANDS of gasoline use additives in
their regular octane fuels?  Are these additives added at the station level,
regionally, or nationally?  Is there an 800 number to call? Is there a
ConsumerReports report?  etc.  According to the owners manual and short term
performance my car is happy with regular octane fuel.  BUT, I don't know if I
am getting the additives needed to prevent some slow-to-accumulate problem.
Is it worth paying for octane you don't need inorder to be assured of
additives you may need?  Thus, is there any way of being assured of the
additives without buying the extra octane?

Steve Tice related that, some time ago, Exxon, Mobil, and Texaco put X (I
forget the additive) in all their fuels and that Chevron only put it in their
premium.  Part of the exact answer I am after.  Anyone have a more exhaustive
and more up-to-date list?

Please permit me to clarify the information I shared with Bruce. I was
quoting, from memory, a Consumer Reports article from roughly 2 years
ago. The goal of said article was to advise readers of brands and grades
of gasoline that would be kind to their fuel injectors and intake valves.

I recall they gave thumbs up to the detergent packages in all grades of
Exxon, Mobil, and Texaco (with the System 3 additives). I imagine
slightly different combinations of chemicals are used by different
companies, and no particular additive for these refiners was given in
the article.

They cautioned that Chevron chooses to put Techroline, their top detergent
additive, in their premium grade only. The regular unleaded and mid-grade
unleaded fuels contained noticeably inferior detergent packages. Based on
the choice of words in Chevron's current ad campaigns, I judge this to
still be true today.

I'm nearly certain that Chevron has a patent on Techroline, so I doubt
the other refiners are using it as part of their detergent packages.

Again, all this is from memory. And the article is out of date. And it
might be even more than 2 years old. And your mileage may vary. And this
offer of information is void where prohibited. And ...

I suggest you read the article for yourself, so you don't have to rely on
my selective memory and inevitable biases.

Subject: Which gas should I use?

In a thread related to the current one on Unleaded Gasolines, I would
like to pose a question for those of us who drive Porsches designed
for (now unavailable) leaded fuel.

I'm looking for recommendations on gasoline brands. I have a '69 912,
which I bought 6 months ago. The previous driver had been driving the
car on super unleaded gasoline, and, predictably had a valve job about
a year ago. Since I've bought the car I've been driving on Arco EC-1
gasoline since I can't get leaded. Would anyone care to comment on...

...whether or not I should be using a Super Unleaded with a detergent?

...whether or not I should be using an additive for leaded cars?

...any particular brands of gasoline?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Is it "Techroline" or "Techron," and if they're different, how so?

Yeah, alright, it's unusual. But it's a feet-on-the-street type problem
so bear with me...

As I may or may not have related, I recently purchased a '74 914 2.0 car
that has been an ITA racer for the last 6 years. I got a really good deal
as the previous owner had a new Spec Racer showing up and needed the space,
and as he'd toasted the engine in it's last race, about 3 months ago.

Since there's a race in the area coming up, I decided to get it ready.
So, I finally got around to tearing it down today. Bummer. I need a new
case. In particular, I need a 2.0 case with a GA prefix. I may also need
a crank and rods, but I can dig that up locally.

If you have one, or know someone who might, or live near a recycler/salvage
place, *PLEASE* check and drop me a note.

Now for those of you with morbid curiousity, here's what happened: the 
oil pump on these guys has one gear that slides onto a fixed post pressed
into the oil pump housing, and one that has a shaft with a drive that slides
into the slot on the front of the cam. Well, in this guy the post wasn't
pressed into the oil pump housing enough, and *rubbed on the rivets that
hold the cam gear to the cam shaft*. This rubbing provided the fatal metal
particulate.  Of course, the oil screen was not installed, so it all went 
right to the number 4 main bearing, and when it was full of metal, to number
3, etc......

However, it's not why I need the new case. The end-play shims were mis-installed
and as a result, when we took it all apart, I discovered that the crank was
sliding back and forth about 0.75mm. The outsides of the bearings were
highly polished from the friction of sliding back and forth in the saddles.
The case warpped from the heat of the friction. The bearing saddles had little
lips at the edge of the friction point. The case edges had big lips where
they'd been rubbing. To fix the case would require re-milling the inner case
edges flat, then line-boring the mains *AND* (here's the hard part) the
cam bore. Bleah.

Oh yeah, no lock washers were used in reassembly, several "use once" stretch
bolts appear to have been re-used, there was RTV in one of the oil passages,
etc. All in all, a really shitty rebuild. I asked the previous owner who
did the work, and was relieved to discover that it wasn't anyone I respected.
Still, it goes to show you that you can't be too careful...

Stan,

I have a 2.0 (GA) partiallly assembled engine, but I wasn't really planning
to get rid of it.  I already have a spare race engine powering my daily driver
though, (try that in GT3!) so I don't really need it.  There were about 
20,000 2.0 914 engines and a significant proportion were imported to the US, 
so I wouldn't think you'd have a hard time finding a used engine or a case.
The going rate for a used engine seems to be about $850.  I'd hate to think of
shipping costs for one of these.

I hate to recommend them, but Automobile Atlanta advertises used cases.  I've 
heard Gary Wigglesworth has lots of used 914 parts (for a price).

You'd think that the interference between oil pump and cam drive gear would have
been apparent when the engine was turned over by hand during assembly.

Which are the "use once" stretch bolts?  

Your story reaffirms my conclusion that the only person you can trust
to rebuild your engine is you.

I just got off the phone with EASY (European Automotive Salvage Yard).  They
have what you're looking for.  A 2.0 case is ~$250.  BTW _all_ 2.0 cases are
GA prefixed, that's the engine code for the 2.0 litre.  They ship, you can
give them a call at:

Subject: 914 oil temp gauge

I have a '73 914 2.0, which came with the optional center console, which
includes an oil temp gauge.  The gauge doesn't work.  I don't know if it's the
sender, the wiring, or the gauge.  Any easy ways to find out?

Important related questions:
(1) Where is the sender?
(2) Above where the shift linkage comes through the firewall, there are a few
    wires that pass through.  One of these has been cut.  Is that the sender
    wire?  What might it be?
(3) Coming out of the bottom of the case, there is another wire with a long
    lead.  It comes out of the center of a large round thingie, about 3-4"
    in diameter.  The lead is not attached to anything.  What is this lead?

Thanks for your help!

Subject: Small fuel gauge

I'm looking for a small fuel gauge for my 914.  I'll be replacing the one in
the instrument cluster with a 911 oil pressure/temperature gauge, so I'm
hoping to find a nice small one that looks decent that's about the same size
as the optional center console gauges.

Any recommendations?  The standard Porsche aftermarket places all carry some
limited subset of VDO gauges, but I haven't seen a fuel gauge.  I'd love
something that will connect up to the stock sender, of course, but I can be
flexible on that.

Thanks for your recommendations!

The sender is in a round, stamped steel cover on the bottom of the 
crankcase (presumably the "thingie" you mentioned in your question 3).
The stamped steel cover seals to the case with a large O-ring, and my
recollection is that if you take it out, it is hard to get it to
reseal without a new O-ring (or at least I couldn't). Also, the stamped
steel cover is actually made in two pieces, with a paper gasket
between. In summary, try to hook the wire back up without removing the
sensor. My recollection is that the wire goes nearly straight up
after running forward to the front of the engine (but behind the fan),
with a bracket or two to keep it where they want it, and joins the
engine wiring harness near the distributor/oil pressure switch, but
it has been a while since I have fiddled with this.

I don't know how useful the standard gauge will be if you fix it.
On at least some of the gauges (there were at least 2 types), the
beginning of the red zone is about 300 Deg. F. I made the serious error
of recalibrating mine (by changing a resistor inside the gauge)
and applying rub-on dial graduations, and then spent the next several
years worrying about how hot the oil was (250-260 Deg. F after a
20 minute run group on the track). I should have left the gauge alone,
and remained fat, dumb and happy with the gauge never higher than
the middle of the "safe" zone. Of course, I could have really fixed
it with a front-mounted oil cooler (no other location seems to get
enough air flow to do much serious cooling), but I never found the
time/money, and I drove the car on the street as well. Based on all
of this, I would leave the wire disconnected, and glue the temp gauge
needle at a location that lets you stop worrying about it. :-)

Yup. Takes a 12v battery setup though. Drop the sender in a pan of oil, with
a pyrex cooking thermometer. Rig up electrics. Heat oil. See what happens.
Note voltage on sender wire,then after you take down the oil-heater deal,
use variable resistor to feed different voltage to the gauge. Should be pretty
obvious if the gauge is non-linear or the sender id crapped out.

(3) answers (1). If the wire from(3) is the cut wire in (2), that's
answered as well.

Mark -

To add to what Stan and Frank wrote, the sender is a NTC resistor, where "NTC"
stands for "negative temperature coefficient."  Which means that as it gets
warmer, its impedence drops.  You can measure this with just an ohmmeter - you
can skip the battery.  I don't know exactly what spec is a different
temperatures, but I suspect from your description you'll find it either shows
some normal-looking behaviour, or it will look open or closed.

You can go right to the source for VDO gauges.  Call up North Hollywood
Speedometer; they distribute VDO and advertise in Pano.  They have a basic 52 mm
(2 1/6") fuel gauge in a list of different variations for different Euro and US
senders, as well as one for a VDO sender.  They also have senders.  And they're
cheaper than the "regular" aftermarket guys.

Subject:      Shoulder belts

I have a 1981 931. Since I have a 6 year old, who is a frequent rear seat
passenger, I am keen to replace the rear seat lap belts, with shoulder belts.
There is an anchor point provided, I believe there was a law requiring that
manufacturers do that much. Although I haven't asked a dealer, I assume Porsche
sells a conversion kit at some prohibitive price. Any advice or experience on
this?
And one more thing: Can anyone find any explanation/excuse for Porsche putting
a speedometer in the 931 with a peg at 85 mph? How ARE we supposed to figure
out how fast we're going?!   :-)
 Was some engineer confused about the conversion from metric perhaps? :-/
