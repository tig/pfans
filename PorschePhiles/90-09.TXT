Subject: 912 Info wanted
--------

    I am interested in buying a 912 and using it for everyday transportation
    and maybe turn it into a vintage racer.

    Can anyone share some useful information such as going price, investment
    value, racing experience?

    Please send replies to:      mvt@hpfcla.fc.hp.com


    Thanks in advance.

    Mick.

	  I have the four-color brochure for the Bob Bondurant school.  
	  It's located in Sonoma CA, and costs thousands of dollars to attend.  
	  If anyone is *still* interested, let me (mikey@ontek.com) know
	  and I'll summarize the courses and whatnot.  I'll even give
	  you the phone number so you can get your own copy for FREE.
	

That isn't true of their basic driving classes, is it? I thought the
one- or two-day courses were only a few hundred dollars. If there aren't
too many courses, maybe you could summarize each one for us.

Bondurant is no longer in Sonoma, they're in southern California.  I don't have
their latest prices, but I'd expect the 1 day class to be in the mid hundreds,
the two day class in the high hundreds to low thousands, and the 3 day to be mid
one-thousand.

I took the 3 day school and highly recommend it if you have more than an average
interest in high performance (safe, fast, fun) driving.  The two day one is
better if you have a bit less interest but still want a good education.  The one
day course is a great refresher for the masses, but is not useful for the
enthusiast driver.

Skip Barber runs a street school in various locations in the U.S. also; check
Autoweek or the other car rags for locations and phone numbers.

If you're a Porsche Club of America member, autocross and track schools are
*much* cheaper and run throughout the year in California and the southern
states.  There's less formal classroom education and no skidpads or lane
manuevering, but you'll learn a lot about going fast safely.  You'll get more
out of the expensive formal courses if you get a primer from PCA first, for
about $75-$100 per day of instruction, vs. $500 for the big-name schools.  It's
also a really fun way to meet people in your area and talk about your common
interest!

Hope I've shed some light (too much?) on driver education!

About the 914 parts car: I probably should have been more clear on a few
things.  With regard to the alloys, I should have said that they can
either go with the car or I would keep them and put these Western wheels
on the parts car (I assume most people wouldn't bring a flatbed up to my
house and drag it up on the bed! :) )
As for pricing, this is the first one I've tried to sell, and it's going
to be worth more to some than to others because of the good condition of
the mechanicals and bad rust, etc.  Also there is a guy coming to see it
this week and may make an offer.  I would prefer that people see it
before I ask for a particular amount.  If nobody can give a reasonable
offer I'm not above storing the thing and using it for parts myself, when
I attempt to get a better 914 next year (when $$$ start coming in)
Thanks for the responses.

Here's what I just told one person in this list about pricing. I'm asking
$1000 (with Western wheels and crumby tires), and with the Fuchs and
good Arrivas and Continentals on them for 1400.  Not bad for something you
can drive away?!
The car is in North Andover, MA, which is about a 40 minute trip north
of the center of Boston.

In response specifically to Steve Timmins, but also to the others in the
list with an interest in this vehicle.
Yes, it's basically stock. 2.0 D-jetronic
Yes, the Fuchs wheels are 4-spoke kind (original, but with some scratches
                                        on the edge near the tire, like
                                        maybe the guy before me scraped
                                        curbs)
The interior has a cracked dash (of course) and the seats have the black
vinyl part cracked in several places; not the seat cushions, just the
parts around the outside of the cushions which are about 2 inches wide.
Steering wheel covering is worn.  Door panel vinyl is quite good, so
is the material on the front of the dash.  You couldn't hurt the carpeting
if you tried.  Which reminds me, it's got the center console (stock one
with voltmeter, clock, and oil temp, all working).  All the heater and
other misc. controls are in working order (not that any heat will come
out, but ... :)

This is turning out to be a high-bandwidth deal!

I saw something neat during last night's ESPN broadcast of the San Antonio
GTO/GTU race (warm-up to the GTP event).  The Nissan's have water cooled
callipers all round.  Water gets pumped through them at around 50 psi, and is
cooled through a radiator in the rear of the car.  Air gets sucked through the
radiator by virtue of the negative pressure generated behind the car.  (So does
someone drafting you heat up your brakes?!?)  Apparently this system keeps the
callipers down to all of about 280 degrees F!

In fact, at this year's Memorial Day Limerock Camel GT, we were
standing at the end of the main straight watching the cars go by.
>From where we were, you could see the rotors on the GTP cars glowing
red during braking.  As soon as the driver let off the brakes the
rotor would go dark (incredible cooling, it would seem).  However, and
we had no idea Nissan was using new brake technology, we did notice
that the Nissan brake rotors would only glow for about 90 degrees of
arc after the brake pad, ie a quarter turn, where all other cars had
their entire rotor glowing.

Ok, things got pretty quiet after I mentioned asking price.  Remember,
this isn't Sears, make counter-offers if you want.  Because I have the
space, and several people were asking for particular parts, I'd be
willing to sell parts off it, disassemble the rest, and keep whatever's
left for myself.

Subject: TK-7 octane booster / lead substitute
Date: Sun, 09 Sep 90 15:13:46 PDT
From: kent@wsl.dec.com

I mentioned seeing an ad for TK-7 a few weeks back. I called the folks
up, and they sent me some literature. It claims to both increase
effective octane and fuel efficiency and decrease valve recession
and emissions. It's apparently been tested by various magazines and
labs and is highly thought of by the BMW gas testing folks.

(Let's see here, legal for use in CA, no alcohol content, test comparing
87 octane unleaded + 1/10 oz TK-7/gal and 92 octane unleaded showed that
the TK-7 blend "consistently provided 4.7% more horsepower at the
peak of the power curve". Another test was apparent octane with
91 octane and 105 octane for reference, the 91 octane + 1/8 oz TK-7 yielded
97.5 apparent octane, and 1/4 oz yielded 100.9 AO.)

It was invented by an Israeli who is now the head of the EPA's council
on lead substitutes. 

The main claim seems to be that it causes more complete combustion
by releasing addiion oxygen, as well as that it leaves a
"synthetic lubricant residual which provides top cylinder lubrication".

Anyway, there are three pages of this. Get your own copy by calling 
(207) 338-5600. It costs $21.00 for a six-pack of five ounce containers;
the recommended dosage is 1/4 ounce per gallon. They also have 
formulations for diesels, two-strokes, and racing applications.

(Oh, and if you really like it, they'll see it by the gallon or the tank car.)

Seems like it might be worth a try, since burning leaded gas really
isn't nice for the atmoshpere. Anyone have experience with this stuff?

Subject: buying a 914


I'm thinking about buying a '73 914 real soon now and wanted to hear about
any mechanical caveats that I might be able to check out on the lot.

I plan to do most all mechanical work myself, so I'm most concerned about
common problems that cost lots of $ for parts (rather than for labor).

To go from a 1.8l to a 2.0l on a '73 is it just a cylinder swap, or are there
lots of other differences (diff. clutch? drivetrain differences?).

It's at a dealer, and the price is pretty low because the seats are ripped
up (haven't seen the damage yet)... I've always wanted to learn upholstery :)

thanks,

I have  a '74 1.8L, and there were minimal differences from '73 to '74
so I can give you some help here, most likely.

To watch out for: rust. And then there's rust. And of course, there's
always rust. Places that rust: under the hood weatherstiping, between
the lower hood latch and the front sheet metal, the floor of the front
luggage compartment, the side inner rocker panels, the jack recievers,
the rear trailing arm mount parts, inside the engine compartment where
the battery sits (and basicly straight down towards the ground from 
there), the interior floor pan, assuming that there has ever been any
trouble with the weatherstriping on the doors, the metal strip that holds
the weatherstipping onto the doors, etc. I think you begin to get the
picture.

Mechanically, the engine is basicly the VW Type IV, so most parts are
readily available. Converting to the 2.0L is a transplant, as the 2.0
heads are Porsche designed (instead of the VW heads on the 1.8) and
it's a stroke as well as bore change. If you do this, be sure and
keep the F.I. instead of going to carbs -- it's a HUGE win.  You can
find used 2.0's for $500 or so, with the F.I., if you look around.

The tranny is the same, and you will likely need some work there. A rebuild 
is variable in price, from $950 to about $1500 for a really good job. 

Other things to look for include the wear on the brake rotors and calipers.
If the rear calipers seem to be sticking, you usually have to replace
(at $260 each) instead of rebuild.

I picked mine up for $1500 about 4 years ago, and have another $3000 or so
in it by now, and am likely to get around to finishing the whole
ground-up restoration this winter. I am the third owner, the car is almost
completely original, and I have most of the papers on it. Otherwise, I 
wouldn't bother.

A couple of other things: 

First, there is a guy who works for Automotion down in Santa Clara that does 
of lot of 914 stuff, and who may be able to help you figure out if this car 
you're looking at is worthwhile or not. I forget his name, but it shouldn't
be too hard to figure out -- just ask for the sales guy who drives the 914.

Second, you really want to join the 914 Owners Association. They are really
useful.

Third, Automobile Atlanta usually has some "restored" 914's in stock, ready
for sale, that have had the rust work done, fresh paint, etc. It may be
worth it to you to get one that's been "done" rather than doing a doityerself
deal.

Last, enjoy! I still enjoy my 914 in the twisties better than my 911!

To Robert Merithew, who asks about buying a 914:  I agree with everything
Stan said, but I have some things to add.  If I can read into your letter,
it sounds like there's a 914 at a dealer somewhere which is a '73 1.8.
If this is what you mean, it's bogus.  The 1.8 was offered in '74.  '73s
had either the 1.7 or 2.0.  Also, for things to look for, the rear brake
discs are getting expensive ~60bucks each.  The bad thing is, if they are
bad, or if the rear calipers are bad, it's almost impossible to look at
the inside disc surface without removing the wheel and spinning the hub,
since theres a dust cover which only has a hole for the pad.  And I seem
to remember that this is the surface which is used with the emergency
brake.  Yes, rear calipers are damn expensive, but I found a pair on a
wrecked car at a swap meet cheap, and installation is simple.  One other
thing to look out for is if somebody swapped the doors with earlier models.
This happened to me.  The pre-73 doors, if you take off the inside vinyl,
have a weird roller-coaster track for the window which really sucks.  The
73-and-on doors have a pantograph-like window mechanism, as well as
good weatherstripping on the front post.  If the doors don't match, then
the car might have been chopped.  One easy way to partially test the inner
rocker panels is to yank really hard on the seat belt and hope the mount
on the rockers is solid. (I don't know what you would tell a dealer if you
'broke' it.)  Be sure that all of the undercoating doesn't look too fresh,
maybe it's been touched up right over the rust.  If the car is sagging, the
door gaps (next to the door handle) will be either too small, or uneven from
the top to bottom.  There's much more which I can't remember, but couldn't
write anyway, since you're probably bored already.

The 914's are, in general, mechanically quite sound.  Their greatest enemy has
been body rust.  There is a very healthy aftermarket for new, used, and improved
components for the cars.  I am aware of only two items in occasional short
supply:

  1. floor pans, and
  2. chassis reinforcement kits.

The latter were and are used by folks who push the cars hard in competition, and
for the 914/6's in particular.

There are a few books for those looking at a 914:

  The Illustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide, Dean Batchelor, 2nd edition,
  pub. Motorbooks Intl.  (devotes about 12 pages to the 914's)

  The 914 & 914/6 Porsche: A Restorer's Guide to Authenticity, Dr. Brett
  Johnson, pub. Beeman Jorgensen

  Porsche 914/4 - 914/6 Handbook, Richard Lovell, pub. Cypress Books

And by all means hook up with your local Porsche Club of America chapter! 
You'll find plenty of 914 owners who will probably talk your ear off about
anything you're foolish enough to get them started on.  Call the national office
at 703 922 9300 for the name and number of your local region's officers.

The 2.0 was offered in all years, but the 1.7 died after '72. Some "early"
'73s had 1.7s, but most had 1.8s; all 74-6 had 1.8s or 2.0s.

The early 914s (1970-1972) were provided only with 1.7 L. engines,
if you neglect the 914-6 (2.0 L, but 6 cylinder, borrowed from the 911T).
The 914 2.0 (4 cylinder) was introduced in model year 1973, and the
914-1.7 continued to be produced (with the major change being the side-shifter
transmission already discussed). My understanding is that the conversion
of the "little" engine from 1.7 to 1.8 L. happened concurrently with the
1974 model year, so that there were 1.8 L's built in 1973, but as 1974
models. I have seen many 1973 1.7's, but I believe that I have never
seen a 1973 1.8 L. Do you have some supporting information?

Frank's right.  The 1795 cc engine arrived in model year '74.  The two lite
engine was available as an option from '73 forward.

Question!

The Houston humidity is beginning to eat the steering wheel on my 71
911T.  This is the second wheel I have put on the car and I wonder if
if anyone knows a treatment that will help preserve the wheel without
losing all the advantages of the leather.  Cleaning with saddle soap
is not an answer and I don't want to put a wooden wheel on the car.

Thanks in advance for ideas.

Subject: '67 912 softback Targa

After having just taken the plunge and bought my first Porsche (an '87 944T),
I've stumbled on what may be a good deal on a '67 912 softback Targa (talk
about the opposite ends of the spectrum...) Here's the deal:

	Has been stored for 5 1/2 years (!) I don't believe it's been started
          in all that time.
        76500 miles showing on the oddometer - no way to verify.
	A southern car. Originally bought in Fla, brought to Ga 6 years ago.
	Leaking oil - looks like this is probably at the seal between the
	  engine and the transmission which will be replaced anyway when the
	   engine gets regasketed)
	'New' engine (semi-installed 5 years ago - heater cables are still
	   dangling, etc). Previous engine had thrown a rod, not sure about the
           history of this one (whether rebuilt or just pulled out of another 
	   912).
	Heat exchangers look good.
	Very little structural rust - some surface rust.
	Good paint (probably not original)
	5 guage option, not typical 912 3 guage.
	Decent interior condition (no rips or tears)
	rear window plastic needs repair (torn zipper).
	Some evidence of bondo on engine cover.
	No evidence of collision damage - though the car has a handmade
	   'custom' gas tank (very angular with huge weld seams. wierd), I'm a
	   little concerned that this might indeed be evidence for a front end
	   accident - I'll be looking into this next time I look at the car.

I met this guy through a friend - the car hasn't been advertised for some time
(I get the impression that he's tried to sell the car on and off for a year or
so). He's asking $4600.  I'm thinking that at $3000, I'd take a chance on the
car (figuring that there's at least $1500 of work in reconditioning the engine
(at minimum regasketing, maybe a complete overhaul) and repairing or replacing
the rear plastic window. 

So my question: what is such a car worth? I think the softback Targa is just
about the coolest body style Porsche ever came up with - does its rarity affect
the value of this car? As I've said in previous mailings of this type, I'm not
really interested in restoring this car for concours, I'm just looking for a
'fun' car to drive around when my 951's in the shop, or for short hops when I
won't have a chance to let the turbo cool down properly before shutdown - help
me out here, I'm really stretching for a rational reason to buy a second car...

What else should I count on having to do to a car that's been sitting for such
a long time? Brake lines? (I imagine that the tires have developed flat spots,
though they appeared to be holding air fairly well). Just how similar is the
912/356 engine to the old VW engines? Can I get a VW shop to overhaul it, or is
that asking for trouble?

+ GOOD GOD, DON"T TAKE IT TO A VW REPAIR SHOP FOR A REBUILD!!!!!!!!!!!
+ (ordinarily, I hate the use of all caps, but this warranted it.....)
+ The Porsche and VW motors look similar, in much the same
+ way that most in-line 4 cylinder
+ water cooled motors look similar, but they have very different clearances
+ and different parts inside. Take it to a real 356/912 shop for your 
+ engine work. Or mail the engine to Harry Pellow out here for your 
+ rebuild. Or get his books and videos and rebuild it yourself....

+ In any event, you should call Pellow and ask him about this. Then 
+ You should buy his books, which tell all sorts of good things to
+ know about 356/912s. His number is (408) 727-1864 Tell him Jeff
+ Zurschmeide referred you.....

+ You might have to replace the brake fluid, but I wouldn't bother 
+ with the lines unless they look bad on inspection. Change the oil,
+ though, and definitely flush the gas tank and lines!

+ I'm envious.....I love targas and 912s......sounds like a real bitchin
+ car in the rough here....

Steve -

You don't say whether anything was done to the car to prepare it for storage.  I
will assume that nothing was.  That being the case, I would recommend against
trying to start the engine.  If it's sat that long without being exercised, it
is in need, almost certainly, of a serious tear-down.

If there's surface rust, I see no reason to assume without real careful
inspection that there isn't any nasty, serious rot hidden from view.  The
bondo's a drag, but it can be fixed.  All to often, when I tour my favourite
shop here, I see one car or another in which someone else's buried bondo job has
reared its head, and is getting picked and filed.

On the plus side, there ain't much that cannot be replaced or fixed on the car. 
You'll have to dig hard for some parts, but trips to swap meets and such should
net you what you need.  For example, I had a new PCA member ask me about Hella
foglights for her '68 912.  I couldn't find the Hella 128's for sale in any of
the restoration catalogue I have.  But I'll bet she can find 'em sooner or
later.

I recommend highly Brett Johnson's "911 & 912 Porsche: A Restorer's Guide to
Authenticity," and Peter Zimmermann's "The Used 911 Story."  There was also
Bruce Anderson's article on buying older cars a few years ago in Excellence.  I
would be happy to forward a copy to you if you send me a postal address.

Sounds like you have a real restoration project on your hands, no?  But you will
probably end up with a gorgeous car if you stick it out; the soft window targa's
in particular and the A-series 911's as a whole are pretty cars.  The 951 will
remain your principal transportation device for the foreseeable future!  Hope
this helps.

First off, don't use saddle soap.  It is said to plug the pores of leather.  Use
instead a cleaner like Lexol, followed by either Lexol leather conditioner or
Connally's Hide Food (my choice).

Is the leather deteriorating during lengthy storage/infrequent driving, or is
this a car that gets driven every day?  If it's not seeing much driving,
consider placing desiccants in the sealed cabin of the car during storage.  (Buy
10,000 new cameras and save the little sacks!)  Alternatively, take the wheel
off the car and store it in a well-dehumidified part of your house.

Subject: 914 1.8 vacuum hose routing question

With all this discussion about 1.8-liter 914s, I thought I'd ask about
a problem I'm having with mine.  I believe that my vacuum hoses are
routed incorrectly, and don't have another good 1.8 to compare with.
Sorry to send this 1.8-liter-914-specific message to the whole list...

I suspect things are wrong because I can't get my idle very smooth,
and worse, it's impossible to have both idle and timing set to spec at
the same time.  I vaguely remember some discussion a while back about
a "vacuum hose going nowhere" in the 1.8 engine compartment.  All my
hoses go somewhere, so this could mean something :-)

I've checked out lots of the other typical bad-idle causing problems;
electrical connections, the oil cap seals, fuel system and ignition
all seem OK.

Anyway, I have two "sets" of three-way vacuum connections (by "set" I
mean a net of three hoses all connected to the same tee).

Set #1 (1/4" rubber vacuum hoses and a tee) connects:
- The port on the TOP of the distributor vacuum advance unit (on the
  side of the diaphragm opposite the distributor)
- A small port on the intake air distributor
- The vacuum port on the fuel pressure regulator (buried way under the
  air box, at the left rear corner of the fuel loop)

Set #2 (1/4" braided-cloth/fabric-and-rubber vacuum hoses and a tee):
- The port on the SIDE of the vacuum advance unit right next to the
  distributor 
- A port on the throttle body just at the narrowest point (where the
  throttle plate closes)
- A port on a module I can't identify - this part vaguely resembles
  the fuel pressure regulator, but doesn't have fuel lines going into it

The piece I can't identify is found on the right side of the engine
compartment, an inch away from the bottom left rear corner of the
battery (right near the fuel lines from the pump).  It has 3 ports for
air hoses.  One thin vacuum hose (toward from of car) is part of Hose
Set #2 above.  There are 2 thicker lines out; one (rearward port) goes
right to the intake air distributor, and another (side port) goes to
yet another tee.  The other lines from this tee go to (1) the
auxiliary air regulator and (2) a port in the air intake system just
past the air box.

The conceptual problems on my part here are (1) I don't know how the
vacuum advance should be working and (2) I don't know what the
"mystery module" is.  I can't find a reference to it in the Bosch
L-jetronic booklet, and the Haynes manual claims that the Fuel
Pressure Regulator should be where the Mystery Module is.

Does any of this sound familiar to anyone?  Does this agree with any
of you other 1.8 drivers?  I'd greatly appreciate any comments or help
on this...

Thanks,

- David                dab@esl.com       ESL Inc., Sunnyvale, CA

There are two important spots you should really look at to check the
integrity of the car. Make sure there are no cracks around the torsion
tube receivers. Inside the rear quarter panels in front of the wheels, look
for a plate held by four bolts, a long cylindrical piece sticking out
of the center. This retainer plate holds in you torsion bars. 
Make sure there is no rust or cracks all the way around that section.
If there is it will be impossible to align the car well and the torsion
tube will probably need replacing or at least the frame reinforced.
Additionally take the spare tire out and check for rust underneath,
just in front of the gas tank. Also ensure the gastank seals all the
way around, otherwise you will accumulate water in the trunk, which
is most rust prone as it is. If those two items are o.k. - it may
be a worthwhile investment.

Subject: 951 tires (and thanks for all the 912 advice)

First off, thanks to everyone who responded to my questions about the 912. I'll
be taking another close look over the weekend, then (hopefully) a trip to
Automobile Atlanta for a closer inspection. I'll keep you informed... BTW, I've
been reading Harry Pellow's "A's B's C's (and 912's)" book and have been very
entertained (but not much enlightened - it's sometimes difficult to wade past
the b.s. (entertaining though it is) to get to the useful technical advice).
Are any of his other books (e.g.  "Secrets of the Inner Circle" more directly
useful? I'm ideally searching for something along the lines of John Muir's
"Compleat Idiot" VW book.

And now for something completely different. My front tires on my 951 are within
a thousand miles of needing replacement (the rears have another 10 or 15... how
irritating...) It's time to buy tires.

The only high performance tires I've had direct experience with are Potenza
RE71's (on my CRXsi) and absolutely loved 'em. Those RE71's stuck like glue. A
fellow 944 (non-turbo) owner fervently recommends Michilen XGTV's (says the
944's weight requires a tire with a strong sidewall). Both were highly rated in
R&T's tests a few years back. What's the current wisdom concerning tires for
the 951? The car is mostly a street car, but I intend to start attending PCA
driving schools and autocrosses. Local prices (mounted and speed balanced (on
the car)): RE71 $850, XGTV $740.

Well, I put in a vote for Yokohama A008...  If you're looking for the
ultimate skidpad test on a dry hot day...  These are the tires.  Got
a friend with them on an RX7.  He's pulled 1g lateral (got a G-analysy
and ran tests).

I've had em twice on my 944 and they really stick.  The reports have shown
them to be really bad in water but I don't know.  They hold the road just
fine for me except of course right at the beginning of light rain.  The
friend in the RX7 doesn't fare so well with them on water.  I guess Porsche
just knows how to make any tire work great.

You know the tire's?  They're the ones with the wide slick on
the outside edge.  For the same price and half but twice as much
wear, you can get the super gluey mega slick A008R which have a
wider slick and the rubber practically comes off in your hands.

I believe that mail order, you can get the tire for approx $130.
Man, what happened to the prices of rubber?  My first set was
$104/tire...

Message-Id: <24900914162242/0003844665NB2EM@mcimail.com>

On the subject of high performance tires, a recommendation would depend on your
personal needs.  I'll infer that you'd like something fairly high performance. 
But what about winter and wet driving?

I've tried the RE71's, Comp T/A R1 (track compound), and A008R's.  The RE71's
are good in the wet and also decent in the dry, and have moderately high
adhesion, but they're dangerous below 50 degrees.  The R1's are nasty when cold
but warm quickly.  They also wear out extremely fast.  They are quite sticky
when warm.  Both the RE71's and R1's are available for around $125 if you get
the shaved flavor (6/32").  BTW, I'd recommend you use sizes 225/50 and 245/45. 
They'll fit in your wheel wells on the stock 7" / 8" wheels just fine.  We've
all been doing that for years.  That goes for stock 85 1/2 + 944's as well.

The tire which I feel is best is the Yokohama A008R.  These days, it comes in
the RTU compound, which means they're 6/32" instead of 8/32" of the R's, at the
same price (around $175).  Nothing comes close in terms of wear or stick.  I get
a full season of track (25 hours) and autocross, plus 10,000 street miles before
replacing them.  They're good in the wet only when fairly new, and will
hydroplane badly when they're low.  The sidewalls are quite stiff, but that
really isn't a concern down at the 45/50 aspect ratios - they're all mighty
stiff.  I've been pulling 1.2 G in flat corners, and 1.3 in uphill/downhill/oval
corners with a stock base suspension, except for Weltmeister bars.

If you'd like a bit more wear with less stick, try the base A008's or A008G's,
or even the A008P's (supposedly for Porsches).  I'd consider an R1 or RE71R
before those, however, due to wet performance considerations and price.  The
RE71R comes in two compounds now - standard and "yellow bead" (more sticky). 
The Comp T/A R1 also comes in autocross and track/street compound.  Don't try
the autocross compound anywhere but in an autocross, or you'll melt them
straight away!

I have a friend who runs RE71R's on a 300hp race 951 (lightened, full
suspension), and he goes through a set in about 90 minutes of driving.  The
fronts overheat and the tread rips down to the cord.  He's an aggressive driver
who slides the car a lot, so some of that is his style.  Nonetheless, I can
catch him in my "wimpy" 260hp street 951 on 8R's, plus I don't buy two sets per
weekend!  I let him borrow my F/L tire for a track time trial after he ruined
his last one, and he couldn't believe the stick - the other 3 corners on RE71's
were quite loose.  The handling was spooky with that combination, needless to
say!

All the mentioned tires are directional, that is, they have a preferred mounting
direction.  The Yok's come in A and B types, and you need 4 different tires to
mount them all the way they'd like.  You can mix A's and B's if you'd like,
though - the mounting preference is only for the sake of the tire internals.

I'd strongly recommend you buy tires mail order.  They're much cheaper and you
get them within 1 week.  The prices I mentioned above are all mail order, except
the R1's which any Team T/A dealer must sell you at the standard price (plus
tax).  Look in Autoweek or other car rags for mail order joints.

Good luck!

Subject: 951 tires

Thanks to Steve Tynor for bringing up the subject of 951 tires. I may
need new tires in the next few thousand miles and have been thinking
about asking this group for advice.

I'd like to hear recommendations for tires for regular usage, which
might be a little different from Steve's question. I might do a few 
autocrosses, but when I get new tires, it will be almost entirely for 
street driving.

The car currently has Pirelli Cinturato P7s. I'm not entirely happy
with them, although not having driven 944s extensively before getting
this car, I can't be sure how much it's the tires and how much it's
the car that's feeling a little unstable on curves.

One thing that bugs me a bit about the Pirellis is that they're very
soft. I often go for days without driving the Porsche, and the thumpety-
thump while they get back in round is kind of annoying. It does go away
in a few minutes, though.

My mechanics are recommending either Yokohama or Bridgestone. I had
Michelins on my Opel GT for years (decades, actually :-) ) and loved
them.

So, what do you other 944/951 owners recommend?

I have a copy of "Secrets" which I have read cover-to-cover on two occasions.
It contains basic car maint. stuff, and many technically compiled graphs such
as "how many miles before the dashboard clock dies."  Half of the book is 
devoted to engine rebuild.  It seems complete, and is written in the style of
Muir's publications.  I would recommend it heartily.

If you do get the 912, please post periodically so the Porschephiles can follow
it's progress!  The 912 is my second favorite Porsche (to the 550).  I agree
that the '67 is the best model overall.  Most important in the engine 
compartment:  Keep the carbs sync'ed professionally, since any slight 
imbalance causes the motor to shake, and this shake has killed the two 912 
engines I have known about.  Good luck!

Subject: Pellow talk

I also have the two Pellow books, "A's B's C's (and 912's)" and
"Secrets of the Inner Circle."  I have found them to be very useful,
and have rebuilt my '65 SC engine using them.  I would say, however,
that the "bs" mentioned in a previous note is pretty offensive, at
least to me.  I found it mysogynist, racist and reactionary.  But I
waded through it.  The versions that I have are almost ten years old,
I think, so perhaps Mr. Pellow has toned down his rhetoric (in later
editions)  now that his dreams have come true.

Patty, I imagine you saw my other response regarding tires today.  That advice
was geared more for competitive use.  For your own use, the Bridgestone RE71 or
Goodrich COMP T/A HR might be nice.   Also consider the Yokohama AVS
intermediate, and Dunlop D40 or D40 M2 (sticky-er).  There are many good tires
that will work well on your car.

The state-of-the-art is being contested by Goodrich, Bridgestone, and Yokohama. 
Pirelli made great tires during the '70s and got quite a reputation with P7's. 
These days however, they're making only "OK" tires as far as the demanding
enthusiast goes.  I'm not saying they're bad, because they're not - Pirelli just
isn't the best any more.  Same thing with Michelin - good reputation but not
leading the pack.

You're pretty safe with most any recognized, major name-brand tire.  That
doesn't mean Sears Roadmanglers!

I'm surprised your P7's flat-spotted in just a few days.  Are you keeping them
inflated to 36/36?  I've never had that happen even when my tires have sat for
weeks.

[End of excerpt from Patty Winter]

I have a set of Bridgestone RE71's on my '84 944. I replaced the stock
215's and wheels with the following setup:

RE71: 225/50ZR16 on epsilon 3-piece 7" wheels in front, &
RE71: 245/45ZR16 on epsilon 3-piece 8.5" wheels in back.

I am very happy with this combo, with one tiny expection. The driver's
side rear tire has rubbed a little a couple times when hitting pot
holes and railroad track crossings. I think stiffer rear shocks will
help solve that.

Road and Track did a big tire test back in 1986, using a Porsche 944 Turbo
as the test car. The Eagle VR50 came in "first", with the RE71 coming
in "second." The reason I quote "first" and "second" was because, in
usual R&T wimpout tradition, they refuse to really hail a "winner". Their
write up was full of "depends on how you drive, what you drive, where
you drive, etc you drive", which is all good and true, but when they
have head-to-heads, I wanna winner! :-)

Anyway, the top-of-the-line Yoko's where highly rated on dry surfaces,
but deadly (according to R&T) in the rain because of their unique edges,
which were not conducive to water transport.

Another nice thing I can say about the RE71's, which probably means
nothing, but I will say it anyway - they balance well. On four tires
and wheels, I only needed additional weight on two of 'em (one weight
each). Now I am not an expert on tire balancing, but the guy at the
shop claims that he has rarely seen tires and wheels balance so
nicely. He also claims that some tires (Dunlops in particular) always
need a "ton" of balance.

Yet Another nearly information-free note: Porsche uses the 225/245 RE71
combo on the 1990 928 (I said it was information-free so don't shoot!).

Good luck on your search!

Pete -

Someone asked about a similar car a few days ago.  Here's what I said then.  The
car had been stored for 5 - 6 years.  As far as pricing goes, it depends very
much on the car's condition.  I would recommend scouting out similar cars in the
classifieds of Excellence magazine and the PCA's Panorama magazine.
_________________________________________________________________________

You don't say whether anything was done to the car to prepare it for storage.  I
will assume that nothing was.  That being the case, I would recommend against
trying to start the engine.  If it's sat that long without being exercised, it
is in need, almost certainly, of a serious tear-down.

If there's surface rust, I see no reason to assume without real careful
inspection that there isn't any nasty, serious rot hidden from view.  The
bondo's a drag, but it can be fixed.  All to often, when I tour my favourite
shop here, I see one car or another in which someone else's buried bondo job has
reared its head, and is getting picked and filed.

On the plus side, there ain't much that cannot be replaced or fixed on the car. 
You'll have to dig hard for some parts, but trips to swap meets and such should
net you what you need.  For example, I had a new PCA member ask me about Hella
foglights for her '68 912.  I couldn't find the Hella 128's for sale in any of
the restoration catalogue I have.  But I'll bet she can find 'em sooner or
later.

I recommend highly Brett Johnson's "911 & 912 Porsche: A Restorer's Guide to
Authenticity," and Peter Zimmermann's "The Used 911 Story."  There was also
Bruce Anderson's article on buying older cars a few years ago in Excellence.  I
would be happy to forward a copy to you if you send me a postal address.

Sounds like you have a real restoration project on your hands, no?  But you will
probably end up with a gorgeous car if you stick it out; the soft window targa's
in particular and the A-series 911's as a whole are pretty cars.  The 951 will
remain your principal transportation device for the foreseeable future!  Hope
this helps.

Yokohama A008R's and their newer A008RTU's are THE tire of choice for most
competitive Porsches driven by folks I know in Northeast Region and the rest of
Zone 1.  Their solid outer band just beats any other tire design hands down for
high performance (track & autocross), while remaining DOT streetable.

Trouble is, Yokohama screwed up bigtime.  They upgraded most of the line from
A008R to A008RTU this year except for some of the larger sizes.  Which means I
can ONLY get A008RTU for the front 225/50VR16, but ONLY A008R for the rear
(where still available) 245/45VR16.  The RTU is a stiffer sidewall, allowing
lower pressures and improved performance.  This sucks.

I've been in touch with Yoko and the distributers all summer.  I talked to
FastTire yesterday, and the latest estimate is that 245/45 RTU's will be
available around the beginning of next month.  Worth the wait?

By the way, the A008R's are spooky in the rain and deadly in snow.  Trust me on
this one (shut up, Selders!).  I have done 80mph in the rain on a highway with
them, but I was wearing shoes at the time.

You can get the same tread design in a normal compound as A008.  The 'R' means
sticky, and depending on how you drive, shorter life time.  Unless you buy them
shaved, the tires will not reach maximum performance until you wear the mold
release compound off.  They come with a fine crosshatch on them; when it's worn
away, so is the mold release (aka "the green").  

An alternative which some have taken in the interim is BF Goodrich's Comp T/A R1
design.  By all reports excellent, just not quite as excellent.

The Bridgestone RE71's and RE71R's are, by most reports, second tier.  No first
hand experience to offer, I'm afraid.  Michelin tires are the choice of nine out
of ten people BMW has victimized with TRX rims; the only alternative for those
poor souls is Avon.  I do like their new ad campaign, tho, with the baby
floating in the tire.  I saw a Testarossa with Michelin V-series at Northeast's
concours last week-end, and almost threw up on my shoes.  Almost as shameful as
the 962C-powered Kremer 930 on RE71's, written up in the new issue of Sports Car
Int'l.

Opinions are cheap... KG

That you have rubbing on the rears with the 8.5" Epsilon and the 245/45x16 tires
indicates what is probably an offset problem with the rim.  The same tire with
fit on Porsche 8" rims without rubbing.

It will also  fit on the 9" rims available as an option starting with the '88
944 Turbo S.  The one change they made was to fold in the top of the lip around
the wheel well, allowing obviously a bit more width in the well.  If this is
where your rubbing is taking place, I'm sure a good body shop could alter your
lips for you (so to speak), and for not a lot of money.

You may "cure" your rubbing with stiffer shocks, simply by limiting suspension
travel and therefore increasing the roughness of your ride.  If I were going to
throw money at the problem, though, I would the several hundreds of dollars
it'll cost you at correct rims rather than shocks.  Neither is cheap!

If new rims do seem the way to go, I can highly recommend doing business with
Robert Wood, who advertises in Pano each month.  I've bought two sets from him,
and many friends have as well, without a single complaint.  I would also caution
doing business with Ernie's Alloys in Florida.

What is this based on? I have driven my 944 with RE71's on the road under
various condition. In particular the temperature being even below 30. No
surprises, really solid, sticky, predictable tire. I can't say anything
about cold track performance but then again there are better track tires
anyway. And some more dangerous things going on as well ...

Lemme throw in my opinion:

If I were going to buy tires for a 951, and I was going to use it for
daily use, I certainly wouldn't get the HR rated tires.  The factory
specifies VR.  Having personally exploded a VR tire (DunSlop) I can say
that having high speed tires is important even if you don't track the
car.

The BFG VR4 is an excellent all season tire and carries a wear rating od
340, as opposed to 140-180 for Comp TA ZR, RER-71 and dunslop D-40 M2.

Regarding RE71s, these are in my opinion the best overall tires on the
market.  Wear is acceptable and they are better than D-40M@ in the rain.

Dunlop D40 is junk.  They wear unevenly and become noisy arfter about
6-8000 miles.  D40M2 is a nice oveall tire, but despite the 180 tradwear
rating, they seem to wear quicky.

People like the Yokes, but thay are BAD in the rain.

Regarding the COMP TA - ZRs - 

On a final note, the BFG are available for 138 and 120 (F and R), plus
about $3.00 each shipping from teletire, which beats out the total cost
of any other option by about $200 at least.  That's about $530
delivered.  They are not wonderful in the rain or snow, but they do
last pretty well.

I still say dollar for dollar, the CompTA ZR tires can't be beat.  Even

What is this based on? I have driven my 944 with RE71's on the road under
various condition. In particular the temperature being even below 30. No
surprises, really solid, sticky, predictable tire. I can't say anything
about cold track performance but then again there are better track tires
anyway. And some more dangerous things going on as well ...

I based my comment about RE71's being "dangerous below 50 degrees" on a personal
experience.

I drive my 951 until late Novemeber in the Boston area, and I see temperatures
in the teens.  At 40 degrees, my usual off-ramp escapades got the car sliding
and in a bad situation.  This after a 15 minute warmup via the commute home at
about 60-80 mph, so they had time to warm somewhat.

To clarify "dangerous", I mean that the drop-off in stickiness with ambient
temperature was sufficient to allow a dangerous situation to arise.  I trusted
the tire to behave a certain way, and it didn't.  I'm not talking about a drop
from .8 to .7 G in the corner - more like to .3 before the car let loose. 
That's too much of a variance for me to be happy with!

Maybe all tires do this, and the RE71 happened to be the tire that scared me
first.  My current Yok 8R's don't do that though...

Message-Id: <94900917165649/0003844665NB3EM@mcimail.com>

Steve's right about the HR rating - don't put them on a 951.  The Goodrich HR is
the tire's name, not necessarily it's speed rating.  But I think that yes, all
"HR's" are H speed rated.  If they ever come out in V or Z, they'd be fine for a
951.

It's interesting to note the problem with D40's getting noisy at 6-8K miles. 
Again, an OK OEM choice perhaps, but not too state-of-the-art.  I know one
person with M2's on a 944 but he doesn't do much with the car so I can't relay
his comments regarding them.

As an aside, a friend has Ruf 17" wheels with A008's (not R) on a 911.  He loves
them, but I've been with him on a track and the car doesn't stick as well as 16"
rims with 8R's.  Plus he has to run in the "improved" class which isn't really
fair to him.  Moral of the story: maybe wait for more tire choices in 17" before
spending $3000 for the wheel/tire combo.

                JBS


r for 85
1/2 and after 944's (and I think for you too) is 1 degree, but I run 2 1/4
degrees with no problem.  Track use balances out the street camber-wear.

I heard of a bad balancing problem with one person's RE71's, but that might've
been the wheel's fault.  Glad to hear yours balanced out nicely.  For OEM use
('90 928), the RE71's a pretty decent choice.  It's certainly better that D40's!

TIRE RACK has some Yokohama A008 Specials for real cheap ($75 for
a 215/60VR15s).  The salesperson said that they priced them low
because of high volume.  He, in fact, has them on his 944 and loves
them.  Does anyone out there know anything about these tires?
By the way, their number is (800) 428-8355.

It's simply gorgeous. Lots of great pictures, more details than the

Ah, right--I *knew* there was something else I don't like about the
P7s that I forgot to mention earlier. :-)

When I first got radial tires (Michelins on my Opel GT years ago), I
loved the way they glided over seams in highways. There was one stretch
of freeway on the San Francisco Peninsula that had been expanded from
two to three lanes years before, and had a seam in one lane exactly where 
the left wheels would normally drive. Luckily, with the teensy Opel I 
could just stay to the right of the seam, but that's another story... :-)

Anyway, before I got radials, the car always jerked a bit when I went
over or along the seam. When I got the Michelins--voila! Nice and smooth.

So here we are 20 years later, I buy a car whose original cost
was ten times that of the Opel, and the thing starts hanging up on
road discontinuities. Grrrr. A friend of mine who used to race Porsches 
says that's apt to be the case with "square edged" tires (relatively 
speaking, of course).

So I guess in addition to "which 951 tires stick well?" I also want to
know "which ones have rounder edges than P7s?"

Steve notes that he has 8" Fuchs rims on his fronts.  It should be mentioned
(repeated?) that Porsche changed the rim offsets in the 944 series with model
year '87.  The larger offset front and rear (53 mm.) makes room for the ABS
brakes (whether you bought 'em or not!).  The '87-forward cars can wear the
dish-shape ("928-style") forged alloys or the new "Club Sport" alloys, and the
older cars can wear the Fuchs five-spokers.  All cars can wear telephone dials,
but they are different parts.

Put simply, pre-'87 rims cannot go on '87-forward cars, and vice versa (at
least, not easily).  And it means that experiments with what will and will not
fit in the wheel wells have to be started all over!

His point about camber adjustment is a good one.  I have seen several 914's
whose camber has been "corrected" by some well-meaning mechanic, causing an ugly
blister above the lip of the well.  By playing with the camber, folding the lip,
and trimming or reshaping wheel well liners, you can probably gain a wee bit
more clearance.

It is not inconceivable that the "bumping" you feel driving the beast after it's
been parked a while, may in fact be due to something other than the tires.  One
thing which comes to mind are the brakes: both the disk brakes and the parking
brake.  If you wash the car before parking it, the pads may bind to the rotor
because of rust.  No problem, this happens to me sometimes.
 
Do you engage the parking brake when storing the car?  Unless you have some
compelling reason not to (like you live on a hill), try instead securing the car
by putting it in first gear.
---
 
Kevin--
 
Good idea. Next time it's going to be sitting for a few days, I'll
leave the emergency brake off and see what happens. (My driveway is
flat, so whatever happens shouldn't be too serious. :-)

Well, I don't care so much about the comfort if it stiffens up the rear
end. I used to drive a '67 Mustang that I rebuilt the entire suspension
on, including heavy-duty truck springs and KYB's all around. It wasn't
really "comfy" but it handled quite well for an old mustang (I did
qualify that! :-)) I am used to a hard ride and I don't mind it. I find
the 944 a little soft, and much of that may be due to the fact that I
need new shocks anyway.

I think I will get the fender lip problem fixed with a little body work,
but I will probably still spring for new shocks...

Do you adjust your own camber? I have a (admittedly dumb) problem with
the 944. I built my mustang from pretty much the ground up. I have helped
friends rebuild mustangs (all '64.5 thru '68) but with the 944 I have
been a babe-in-the-woods. I change my oil and add other fluids, but
I haven't done any other repair work. I did buy the Haynes book but I am
still studying it. Ok, I admit it. The 944 is, at least to my eyes, an
order of magnitude more complicated than a '67 Mustang coupe with a 302ci
small block, no air-conditioning, no power brakes, no power-steering, no
pollution gear, no heater, a foot pump for the window washer, two water
hoses (radiator to block, water pump to manifold), no vacuum hoses
(mechanical advance dual point dist), high-rise intake mani and a holly
gas-sucker.

I look at the rear end of the 944 and see stuff I don't understand. To
learn I have to play, but I don't want to screw something up. I don't
have a garage around here where I can watch and learn from a pro, and
it's all rather frustrating. 

Ok, sorry, I let my frustration show a little. I love the car, but I
am afraid to work on it. Shall I duck and cover now???

Living in Oregon, the rain-warnings on the Yoko's really scared me. It is
wet 260 days a year here, and I felt with the information I had the RE71's
where the best all-weather tire there. The C&D (or R&T, can't remember)
*really* liked the Yoko's on dry roads, and I believe they came in 1st or
2nd on dry road categories, but I wanted something that acted evenly on
wet or dry. 

Another disturbing note concerns the amount I paid for the tires. I
realize this will probably cast me in the "stoopid-rookie" category, but
I paid just over $200/tire for the RE71's. That price includes mount,
balance, and road-hazard, but it still sounds like I got zapped. I am
not one of these people who likes to brag about how much I spent when
a half-price product is available just down the block, and I was too
dumb to buy it there instead.

So, what do people do to learn how to work on their cars?

Buy then new haynes manual (make sure you get the 90 version) for 944
and turbo.  Sit down and read it...cover to cover.  Look at the exploded
veiws.  Also buy the book "Porsche 944" (unknown author, readily
Dg it will trace history from the 914 project and VW's involvement with
Porsche on the 924 project.

The local porsche club should be very helpful.  Our region and
neighboring regions are very tech-oriented, if you talk to the right
people.  Up-Fixin der Porsche from PCS is also quite helpful, and
reading Excellence and even VW and Porsche will help.  Back issues are
advisable, since many topics have been discussed and won't be repeated.

If you can get your hands on it, the Porsche factory repair manual is
nice.  Unfortunately, you must also have the 924 set top make it
complete, and if you own a turbo, te turbo set, which combined cost over
$400.  Copyrights aside...find a Xerox or just get copies of what you
need.  This is much more complete than Haynes, but doesn't give any
shortcuts and assumes you are a trained porsche mechanic and have all
the factory specialty tools.

Steve - Yah, I'd agree the 944 engine/suspension is slightly more complex than
your Mustang's!

No, I don't adjust the suspension settings myself.  It requires a custom tool
for the rears, and lots of bolt torque that I can't generate in the driveway. 
Plus I can't accurately measure those little numbers!

I'd suggest that if you put stiffer rear shocks in, you do the same to the
front.  Maybe you already were gonna, but I wanted to let you know just in case.
Otherwise you'd have some fun oversteer to contend with!

To learn the car, I just started taking things apart.  I also bought the genuine
Porsche factory manual (less the turbo stuff) for about $125 a few years ago. 
It's somewhat helpful, but very lacking in lots of areas.  And, as others have
already mentioned, hang out with the right people at PCA meetings and events and
you'll begin to pick up helpful hints.  Maybe you can make friends and have
someone come by your house to tinker on your car with you.

Patty, you've discovered one of the aspects of wide tires vs. narrow - wider
tires "tramline", or follow road irregularities very accurately.  It gets worse
as the tire tread gets wider.

Tire widths (i.e., 245) specify cross section width at the widest point (in
millimeters), but this only roughly correlates to the actual tread on the
ground.  A 245 tire may have only 215 mm on the tarmac.  I've seen published
tire tests where one manufacturer's 205 has more tread than another's 215!  It
really depends on the sidewall shape, i.e., straight vs. curved.  Unfortunately,
the tread width is rarely published and as such isn't easy to obtain.  I'm
afraid the only information I can offer relative to this topic is that the
Yokohama had one of the narrowest treads for a given width.  As to which tires
have rounder shoulders, you'd have to go to a store that sells them all and see
for yourself (bring a metric tape measure too!).

Your Opel's Michelins could have been better on the road cracks due to softer
sidewalls (see also, "comfort").  Perhaps it was the radial design too, after
low-tech bias-ply.  The 944 is much heavier and has wider front tires, so it'll
be far worse than the Opel was.  I'd say for your needs, stick with stock
205/225 tires, run the fronts a little low (maybe 32 psi for a 951), and have
the front toe angle checked - it should be 1/16" total toe-in.  Also, keep the
front camber at spec: -20', or -1/3 degree +- 10'.  That'll insure the
camber-steer is within spec.

What I do to deal with imperfect roads is just speed up.  It's much more
acceptable to me for a car to be darty at 100mph than, ahem, 55.  :-)

A008s have a lot rounder edges. I drive a 911 SC with slightly pulled
fenders (pulled about 1/4" and lips reduced and bend up). I drive
8 x 15 and 9 x 15 in BBS rims with 205-50 and 225-50 tires for awsome
handling. Originally I had P7s and hated them. They cleared the fenders/
wings fine but had terrible handling in both wet and dry and didn't last
either. But ride comfort and noise was good, predictability o.k.
Then I changed to BFG comp TAs. Terrible!!!!! Due to their square, bulged 
out design they rubbed on all fenders at the same size. In addition they
were terribly load. Both at high speeds straight they sound like
winter tires and they produce a lot of tire noise when cornering.
They are also terrible on tracks, even worse than the Pirellis. They
lasted O.K., at 14,000 miles I was through on the belts. (this was not R compound!) Then I switched to A008s. Fantastic tire in every respect except
for wear. They are much rounder, do not rub in any of the corners, give
a very smooth ride with very low noise and are very predictable.
I can get much better times with them than with either the comp TAs or
Pirellis. Unfortunately they do not last. I am almost through to the belts
on the rears now after about 10,000 miles, I only mounted them in April.
For performance I can really recommend them over the others, just don't
expect them to last so. (mine are only A008Gs, I wonder how much better
the Rs even handle and how short lived they are!

Karl mentioned an interesting thing that I'd forgotten from earlier this year
when I tried Comp T/A R1's on my 951: they are much louder than 8R's and created
a very annoying booming resonance in the neighborhood of 80mph.  It was almost
unbearable!

I wonder if Yok made their sidewalls round on purpose, so we customers could
mount big gumballs and not have fender problems.  Sounds like the marketing
dept. is at it again!

Subject: 944 tires


As long as the subject is active, I am also trying to make a decision
on my next set of tires for my 1987 944S, which has 7x15 wheels
all around. My priorities are:

1. reasonable wear- I'm not sure I can precisely define "reasonable",
                    but a season of perhaps 10 track events included
                    in perhaps 10K total miles on a set of tires would
                    qualify as reasonable.

2. dry track performance- I use the car for both street driving and
                    PCA driver's education. I am a wimp in the rain, so
                    wet track performance is not a big issue. I drive
                    the car relatively hard, so freedom from "chunking"
                    is an issue.

3. plausible safety on the street in the wet-

4. ride comfort, etc.

I am leaning towards A008Rs or possibly A008s, but had several questions:

- Is there any difference between A008R and A008RTU except 6/32"
versus 8/32" initial tread? For instance, is the compound the same?
Should I expect roughly 2/3 the lifetime from an A008RTU (based
on stopping at 2/32")? Will yokohama make both, or is this a transition?
If the latter, does anyone know why they are doing it? Are there other
results of lifetime on the track of either tire, other than Jim's
recent posting?

- Is the regular A008 being replaced, or are the other variations
to be produced in parallel?

- I will probably stick with 215-60/15 (as opposed to 225-50/15),
due to gearing. The 944S already has a reasonable 5th gear (3150 RPM
at 70 MPH), so I am tempted not to go up another 5 %. On the track,
the current gearing is a reasonable fit to the Glen and Lime Rock
(but not for Summit Point) with my admittedly slow current tires
(Dunlop D4). Given all this, are there results out there for 60 series
examples of the A008 family, or a guess on how well the 50/45
series lifetime experiences would apply?

The A008RTU replaces the A008R, once Yoko gets their act together and finishes
producing TU's in all sizes.  No idea about the A008 being replaced; this is the
first I've heard of it.  I have no idea what the A008G or A008P (for Porsche)
are.  Does anyone else?  I think the reduced depth comes from shaving 'em a bit,
but I could be wrong.

Last weekend, I drove to an autocross through the rain on a set of A008R's which
are on their wear bars.  Scared the dickens out of myself; not recommended.

A008R's rule, totally.  Where available.

I saw the FAX this evening, and the list of wheel kinds being dumped is a lot
more limited than I had originally inferred.  The part numbers are:

 928 361 016 00  7Jx16  65 mm   telephone dial  pre-86 928 (no 4-piston brake)

 951 362 117 00  8Jx16  10.6mm  Fuchs 5-spoke   pre-87 944, 951

And there are also:

 911 645 160 01 - Reno radio
 911 645 180 00 - Charleston radio

I had only the part numbers, and looked up everything else in the tech

box, and the prices are very aggresive.

RTU's have stiffer sidewalls and a slightly different compound than 8R's.  You
should expect 50%-67% the life of an R on the RTU's.  I have both R's and RTU's
on my car and the R's really hold up better.  I think this is a way for Yokohama
to increase sales/revenue/profit on the product line.  In my highly unscientific
test methods I can tell no difference in performance between the two.  They're
both fantastic!

The RTU/R is the only tire being changed as far as I know.  The G's and P's are
untouched.  Perhaps a call to Yokohama can confirm this.

I've been told that D4's (your tires) universally suck.  My friend with the D40
M2's says they're pretty decent all-around tires (track, street, rain).  He
hated his D40's, so it sounds like the M2 is a vast improvement.

You'll like the 8R/RTU's - besides being sticky, the solid outer tread block
doesn't chunk at all.  I think they'd satisfy your stated mileage requirements,
but I wouldn't dare drive in the rain for the last half-season.

Happy hammering!

Subject: Porsche out of CART

	As rumored, Porsche is pulling out of CART tp pursue
their 3.5l normally-aspirated engine for the World Sports Car 
championship, and F1 [reported in MotorWeek on ESPN]. 

	Sorry to see Porsche leave without really making a mark;
the most excitement they generated was from the CART ruling 
against their chassis design at the start of the year.  They were
competitive, but not very.

	Personally, this is just as well with me, as I prefer to 
see them (back) in F1.  It may not be immediately back to the heyday 
of McLaren-TAG-Porsche, but the competition is fierce in F1 at the 
moment, and Porsche is sure to learn a lot in this forum.

Well, the last time I had posted some info on racing, I got no
feedback so I assumed noone else was interested.  But, seeing
the last two postings on Porsche leaving CART, I thought I
would add my 2 cents. :-)

Helmut Flegl announced that Porsche would withdraw from Indycars
at the conclusion of the season.  The team and drivers have been
released from any obligations for the 1991 season.  He also laid
to rest any rumors that Porsche would supply engines.  Bayside
motorsports, a long time IMSA Porsche customer, had been trying
to buy the engines for $4-$5 million per season, but Flegl reported
that the factory felt the strain would be too great to supply both
engines for CART and Formula 1, and Porsche has definitely committed
to Formula 1.  The current rumor is that Derrick Walker will become
the team manager for Jim Hall's Chapparal racing with Lola-Chevrolets
for the 1991 season.  The drivers are rumored to be Danny Sullivan and
Teo Fabi.  There has been no mention of John Andretti's plans, but
speculation is that he might go back to Sports car racing, or over
into Formula 1 as a test driver for the Porsche-Arrows team.

The driver speculation still exists for the Porsche-Arrows team.
Apparently, Hans Stuck and Derrick Bell have been selected to do
some of the initial chassis/engine testing, but neither is interested
in driving Formula 1.  Thierry Boutsen has been mentioned as well
as Teo Fabi for the ride, but neither has commented on it in any way.
Ivan Capelli has also been mentioned.  The current drivers for
Arrows (Michele Alboreto and Alex Caffi) have been eliminated from
consideration.

This information comes from ESPN/SpeedWeek and Knight-Ridder news
service.

Since I'm one of the editors of our local region PCA newsletter (the
other editor is also in this group), I have all the articles on line.
If people are interested in seeing them, let me know and I'll post.
Here's an article Karl wrote for a regular column called "What
Porsches can do to People," which is usually about how strange
Porsche's can make some people act.  This month's column, however, is
about how strange Porsche can act:

WHAT PORSCHE CAN DO TO PEOPLE          by Karl Frank Hens

When you look at the motor sport world, it seems Porsche's
prancing horse is limping. In IMSA and sport prototype races 
Porsches are being blown away by Mercedes, Jaguar and even by
cars like Toyotas and Nissans - boy, writing this really hurts!
In the CART series Porsches just aren't winning either. While a
second place finish meant a total and painful defeat in the late
seventies and early eighties for any race Porsche participated in, 
a fourth place finish at this year's Le Mans was called a 
"respectable success" by Porsches Technical Director Dr. Ulrich Bez 
- I'm getting tears in my eyes! What is happening here?

Defeated beyond hope, Porsche is officially withdrawing from sport
prototype racing for the next season. You may not fully understand yet
what I am saying here! I am not talking about factory sponsored cars,
Porsche is actually telling all its customers - private teams - to
withdraw from racing 962s to save further embarrassment. On July 27,
1990, a black day for PCAers, technical director Dr. Ulrich Bez and Head
of R & D Helmut Flegl released a letter to its 962 customers.  In this
letter it says: "Porsche recommends that its customers refrain from
the use of the existing Porsche Type 962 in the World Sportscar
Championship."  A copy of the original letter appears on page 14.

Porsche claims FISA is at fault, as they released new rules for
the 1991 season, which leaves no chance for turbocharged cars.
They further claim that the requirement to increase the car's weight 
by 100 kg (about 200 lbs) raises it to a level that it was not designed 
for. For reasons of safety and reliability many components like
brakes, tires, and suspension parts would  need to be checked and
possibly redesigned to cope with the additional strain. Porsche feels 
that this expense can not be justified.

Instead Porsche Research center in Weissach has started to design a
new sport prototype for the 1992 season. It will have a normally
aspirated 3.5 liter motor, that has originally been developed for
the formula 1 team Footwork-Arrows, but will be used for the 962 
successor.  See Page 15.

Most information in this article was extracted from "Saugmotor-
Rennwagen von Porsche", Auto, Motor und Sport, No. 10, 4. May 1990,
West Germany and from "Der schlappe Rappe", Auto, Motor und Sport,
No. 17, 10. Aug. 1990, West Germany.

Subject: Images?


Recently, my research has taken me into the realms of image compression,
so I have begun to collect interesting images.  Of particular interest to
this group are 2 Porsche crest bitmaps (one monochrome, the other 4 color)
that were posted to alt.sources a while back, and numerous GIF files (911
Targa, 928, 930, 944 GTP, 951).  I would be happy to make these available
to anyone who wants them.  And, I was wondering if anyone else had any
wonderful Porsche pictures.  I would particularly like to find pictures
of a 959, 956/962, and/or any of the Porsche Indycars (what is the project
number?).  Unfortunately, I don't have a color digitizer, or I would
already have filled my image disk partition several times over. :-)
Anyone else out there with pictures?

I have a set of 7,8 x 16" fuchs alloys for sale for a 951 (86), 944, or
911.  These wheels have the correct offset for both the 911 and the 911

spacers.  The wheels were purchaced new last november and are in
excellent condition.  They include hand-painted center caps and are in
the factory finish.

$950 o.b.o.

I have upgraded to 951S (different offset) suspension, but will keep
them if noone is interested.

Also:  I have a set of 7 and 8x16" phone dials which I could be
persuaded to part with for conciderably less.  These were my track
wheels and  straight but could use repainting.

friends,
it's is a sad moment of history to see the porsche crest not backed by some
racing success.  all we have left is sales.  yuk.

latest autoweek mentioned that after the 944 and 928 get's one more face lift,
it will be discontinued.

and maybe the 911 will get a narrow angle v8.

looks like Dr. Porsche really hit on something when the 901 (911) designed.

what pisses me off about the racing these days, is that nissan and toyota
are having a field day with their success, alway mentioning that thye
beat porsche.  sad, very sad.  ;-(.

did the company overextend themselves?  who knows.  i just wish that porsche
made real race cars again... that win.

you know, win on sunday, sell on monday.

 Yeah, because they can't seem to get any power out of the 3.6 litre.
247 hp is pretty lame.

I've learned through the years to take what the magazines say very lightly. 
Come on guys and gals, don't get hyped up because one article mentions some
possible changes!  The 911 was going to be killed in '77 and replaced by the
928, remember?  Wait for more documentation and time before getting concerned.

In any event, Porsche will give us something new to play with.  We might not be
able to afford it, but we can touch it in the showroom...

That sentiment reminded me of something that happened to me about a year
ago while I was in the dealership picking up some obscure little part that
I needed right away - I think it was something minor like a caliper or some
such. Anyway, I was hanging out on the showroom floor looking at the  cars
on display while my part was pulled. There was a 930S, complete with slant
nose at about $89,000 ("ooooh. expensive"); there was a 928S, black in and
out, at about $64,000 ("too much for a water pumper..."); and there was a
Carrara cabrio with all the goodies for about $56,000 ("well, that's pretty
reasonable.... *WAIT A MINUTE* -- did I say *REASONABLE*!!!!).

Sigh. I still believe that they did that on purpose....

Subject: 959


According to this month's Excellence Magazine, there is currently one,
and only one, 959 in this country (legally).  That one is in a museum
and can not be driven on street or track.  All of Holberts 959s were
sent back to Europe.  There is a second one being held by the EPA
which belongs to Bill Gates.  He is attempting to prove, using
computer modelling rather than the "destroy four" crash tests, that
the car will pass EPA and DOT standards.  Other than that it is
illegal to own a 959, even if it is garaged or whatever, in this
country.

I have heard a rumours from a few people that they "know of someone"
with a 959 in their garage, waiting for it to become legal.  If anyone
knows anyone who has one you better keep your mouth shut because
you can get in a lot of trouble if you're caught with one.  I suspect
that these rumours are just bravado, though.

	Do you have a different numbering system for Porsches in the US?
Over here, the 911 is *the* Porsche (the really ugly# one with the bulging
headlights). The 928 is the entry level Porsche, with a 1600cc (?) Audi
engine - i.e. they are at opposite ends of the Porsche spectrum. I could
never imagine the 928 replacing the 911.

	Mind you, I wouldn't mind if I could afford even a 928 !!

Philip--

928 as an entry-level Porsche? No, that isn't how it is over here in
the Colonies! They're tens of thousands of dollars more than a 944.
Don't you have 944s there? (The cute ones. :-) )

I don't see how there could be different numbering systems, but the
928s over here certainly don't have 1.6 liter engines. Even my 951
(944T) has 2.5--and isn't it a half-sized 928 engine?

Given the clues:

I can only conclude that 928 must be the "English unit" conversion

Subject: Entry-level Porsches, Quality improvement at Porsche

	The recent discussion of entry-level Porsches reminded me
of the recent quote:

   "The entry-level Porsche (of the future) is a used Porsche."  

Anyone else decry this decision to move up-scale and *not compete*
with the Japanese?   My fear is that this is retreat, and capitulation.
To be followed soon by collapse.  I realize that Porsche wishes to
retain an image of exclusivity (sell fewer, not more cars), but this 
does not mean that Porsche has to retreat into a higher-cost market,
and that there can be no entry-level Porsche.

	Anyone know how far Porsche has come in incorporating Deming-style 
("Japanese") quality-improvement techniques into their design and mfg?
A recent article quoted an important MIT study of the auto industry,
finding that:

	* "European producers are even further behind, with quality 
	  and productivity improvements at a virtual standstill in
	  many countries and little incentive to abandon current
	  mass-production methods." [Paul Leinert, "Inside Detroit", 
	  Automobile magazine, pp. 52-54, October 1990].

I hope that this does not refer to Porsche!  The signs at BMW are positive 
(a flurry of new models from engineering, direct competition with the 318i 
against Japanese in low end of the market).  I hope that both BMW and Porsche 
survive this change in design techniques, to produce great autos into the 
future (at lower cost and better quality!).

   "Ongoing quality improvement is a disease, that, if you *don't* catch it,
   you may die as a result (in the marketplace)."
	[Joel Barker, "Discovering the Future"]

	Interesting.  I can't count back to a Porsche that has a 1.6l engine.
Certainly no model in the U.S. market currently has so small an engine.
As stated before, the clues given point to a 924 (not a 928).
Perhaps Phillip is perhaps referring to a 914 as an entry-level
Porsche (a model that has long since been discontinued).  Current 
Porsche models in the U.S. are:

	911	3.3l flat 6 cyl.	247 Hp
	928	5.?l 8 cyl.     	326 Hp
	944	3.0l 4 cyl.     	208 Hp

>  Even my 951 (944T) has 2.5l--and isn't it a half-sized 928 engine?

	Yes, the 944 4-cylinder is "half" of the 928 V-8.  
The 944 is Porsche's redesign of the 924, which was originally 
to be a VW/Audi product with a 4-cylinder engine.  When Porsche
redesigned the (whirring, underpowered) 924, they considered several
powerplants, including 6-cylinder engines, but were constrained not 
just by the dimensions, but also by the Audi manufacturing process
which forced them to stay with a 4-cylinder engine, that could be
installed from underneath.  Cleaving half of the 928's recently-designed
V-8 was the best idea found.  (By the way, 944s manufacturing will
soon be taken over by Porsche, when the current contract runs out).

FYI, the "whirring, underpowered" 924 plant was also used in the Audi 100 LS,
a truck not imported into the US, and -- ta da! -- the AMC Gremlin (albeit
a licensed version).

Subject: racing in pca

you may have heard pca is considering sanctioning a racing series.
a bunch of us interrogated dennis thovson on the subject at the
last nnjr meeting.  here are some tidbits.

1) no decision has been made yet.  some people think pca racing is
   a great idea, some think it's a really stupid one.

2) car damage would [hopefully] be minimized by taking an attitude
   similar to that in vintage racing.  there is *no* excuse for
   bending a car.  if you do, you sit out some number of events, or
   perhaps for a year.

3) pca doesn't want a racing series to destroy the driver education
   program (eg, by luring instructors away).

4) insurance is unknown.

whatever happens, if it happens, probably won't happen by next year.

no idea what to make of all this.  me, i want to *keep* my warranty..

Subject: Re:  Entry-level Porsches, Quality improvement at Porsche

Well, in my opinion, you have to look at the cost of doing business. Porsche
is an independent company, doing what, between $150 and 300 million a year
in total business, including patent royalties, licenses, contract research
and car sales??? And Nissan is part of a keratsu that does oh, say $12 billion
a year????

So, given that, how hard is it to write off r & d to build a whole new car,
and sell the car for a margin over cost-to-produce, as opposed to having
to fund the whole thing from your sales costs (i.e. the money they spend
today has to come from somewhere....)??? The Japanese companies have a 
huge advantage there.

Much as I'd like a cheaper Porsche, I don't want to sacrifice the company's
independence, performance orientation, or overall quality to get that.

Besides, the next Porsche in my future (assuming I don't trade my '81 Targa
for the '83 Cabrio that I discovered over the weekend) is likely to be a
'72 911S coupe, with a '84 factory Turbo-look (M461) as a second choice.
I really like the Carrera 4, and got a tremendous charge out of driving it,
but my heart is really with the older cars anyway...

I assume you are refering to the article in Autoweek, it claimed that Porsche 
will built a 4-seater and the 911 using a 3.5-4 litre V8. Notice the project 
number 989, this is the same number that the factory used for their
motor/suspension test mule, it can accomodate front/mid/rear of 4/6/8 engine
configuration.

I still remember when Das Bild am Sonntag published a Hans Lehmann's photo of
the mule claiming it is the next affordable Porsche 989, (motor trend and some
others also picked the story).  Some of my friends in the studio still have the
picture of Lehmann's Audi Quattro in the parking lot taken purposedly out of
focus titled "Hans Lehmann at work".

Logically, sometime this is hard to justify. But emotionally, it's got my vote
for the sports car of the century. One thing about love and passion, you don't
have to justify it.

Au contraire, the fact that the 962 is still out there doing battle is an
incredible testament to its brilliance, the 956/962 models lasted longer than
most if not all Japanese street car models. It's has won 11? Lemans and more
than all the victories that Nissan, Toyota etc.. have won combined.

I don't think they have over extended themselves. In IMSA, Neither the Nissan
(Electromotive) nor the toyota (Eagle) are built by these companies. If there
is one place where they made a mistake, it was in CART, where they were so
arrogant to think that they could beat the old boys by building their own car
(both engine and chassis), they had no experience building the chassis (neither
do the old boys; March, Lola and Ilmor are all British) and quickly learned
their lesson.

Porsche is getting back to F1, this is where it's at, outside the cotinental US
not that many people know or care much about CART or IMSA. The US, while still
is the largest market, is no longer as dominant as it once was. Rumor is that
they are getting back into group C with a new car. It wasn't that long ago that
the TAG motor kicked everyone's ass in F1.

    > you know, win on sunday, sell on monday.

This Porsche has done sucessfully for a long time.

Porsche model numbering is nearly identical everywhere. You must be talking
about the 924, with the old Audi 2.0 liter engine of around 125bhp.  Yah, that's
a dog.  The 928 is the big luxo-cruiser with the wonderful all-aluminum 4.5 /
4.7 / 5.0 liter V8.

If anyone needs assistance with 951 or 944 master cylinders, rotors, or brake

 I now have great wisdom, and will never again replace my own booster.

Symptoms leading to the above are shuddering under braking (warped or cracked

(bad booster).

About a year ago (when I was shopping for my Porsche) I realized
that the definition of "entry-level Porsche" had gone up $25,000
in only 4-5 years! 

Remember around 1986 or so when you could get a 924 for $20,000? 
By last year, the only game in town was a 944 S2 for $45,000. 
(That's why I bought an '86 car. :-) )

Speaking of 924s, when I visited a couple of dealerships back then,
one salesman told me with a perfectly straight face that the 924 
"doesn't have as many driver comforts as a 944, but is a great second 
car, like for doing the shopping." My only thought was, "Is this
guy serious? $20,000 for a car to pick up groceries and run the
kiddies to school?!" I wonder whether that was Porsche's official 
product positioning.

Subject: Porsche move upscale may mean they're not competitive (dying)

	Thanks to Stan Hanks for his reply.  Stan makes some good
points, but I disagree with the thrust that Porsche needs to move
upscale to ensure financial independence, performance orientation, 
and continued success.  I think that Porsche may be moving to
avoid competition, since it can't currently compete with the 
(more efficient) Japanese design and mfg: 


	Stan Hanks replies to my query on Porsche giving up on the 
    moderately-priced sports car market:
>>  Well, in my opinion, you have to look at the cost of doing business. Porsche
>>  is an independent company, doing what, between $150 and 300 million a year
>>  in total business, including patent royalties, licenses, contract research
>>  and car sales??? And Nissan is part of a keratsu that does oh, say $12 
>>  billion a year????

	Agreed: Porsche has less capital that Nissan.
But how does this dictate their strategy to give up the 
moderately-priced sports car market?


>>  So, given that, how hard is it to write off r & d to build a whole new car,
>>  and sell the car for a margin over cost-to-produce, as opposed to having

	Porsche does *not* "have to fund the whole [car development] 
entirely from sales costs."  They have both cash in the bank, and
a fairly good cash flow.  They are developing new models today, 
using this cash position. (Let me repeat the question:) So why 
does Porsche have to more costly cars, if not to avoid competition 
with the Japanese?

	Perhaps you are suggesting that Nissan is effectively dumping 
their product by producing a good car and selling "at a margin 
over cost-to-produce", in order to drive Porsche away from this market?
And Porsche has decided to retreat based on this tactic?  

	I don't agree here - I think that Nissan sells cars in this 
niche because there's money to be made: by Chevy, or Porsche ... or Nissan.
I think Porsche has decided to leave this game, TO AVOID DIRECT COMPETITION
with Nissan and other Japanese manufacturers, to pursue a different niche.
This is both disappointing to me immediately (we can forget about affordable
Porsches), and dangerous (the company is running away from competition 
- a fight that it can't run away from forever, and is choosing to shift 
its market slightly in the process).

	My premise is this: why not stand and fight in this market,
because successful competitors will not allow you to comfortably retire
producing cars in an up-scale (read: profitable) market.  Certainly this 
has been shown to be true in the U.S. luxury sedan market: witness the fact 
that *every* major Japanese company has dove into the luxury sedan market 
\\because there's money to be made.// I think that Porsche should just as 
well compete now.  They can run, but they can't hide.  (Honda (Acura) 
already has an incredible first product in this market in the NS-X, 
and Mitsubishi (!) shows capability of producing formidable 4WD products 
that demand comparison with the 964).


>>  Much as I'd like a cheaper Porsche, I don't want to sacrifice the company's
>>  independence, performance orientation, or overall quality to get that.

	So to save the company, the products have to be more expensive?  
Costlier products don't inherently make it easier for Porsche to succeed.
Costlier products would seem to be costlier to produce, which would
be disadvantageous for Porsche (using your argument above) and easier 
for a better-capitalized company (like Nissan) to attempt.

	It's not that I want a *cheaper* Porsche, so much that I'd like
to see one that competes on performance/price with the many competitors.
And doesn't become uncompetitive, and then devoured, and then a legacy, 
as has Jaguar (among others).

	One of the three items Stan mentions is a concern - cost, the 
other two should not be.  Financial independence is a concern.  But *any* 
product is costly to develop.  A middle-priced model by itself does not 
seem to require a compromise of the company's financial independence, 
any more than any new model development.  The question is: Where do you 
wish to compete?  I think it appears to Porsche management that there 
is less competition in that market segment at the moment, so off they go 
(leaving many customers behind).

	I disagree that Porsche might have to "sacrifice performance 
orientation, or overall quality." Porsche should continue to build
exemplary sports cars - high-performance, quality cars.  They don't 
have to move up-scale.  But I think that their fear is that the 
Japanese have, with the widespread use of quality improvement techniques, 
the means to produce nearly-equivalent performance at less cost.  

	Porsche may (incorrectly) think that due to Japanese competition
in the middle-cost sports car market, that they must then move out of 
this market.  But, in fact, they must (at some point) stand and fight 
- why not now?  Either they can compete on performance/price, or they can't.
All they do in moving upscale is lose some of their customer base,
and BUY SOME TIME.


>>  Besides, the next Porsche in my future (assuming I don't trade my '81 Targa

>>  I really like the Carrera 4, and got a tremendous charge out of driving it,
>>  but my heart is really with the older cars anyway...

	I love old Porsches, too, but I fear that Porsche may be becoming
less competitive, and therefore less likely to survive ... depriving us
of more old Porsches for us to froth over. 

	I work in quality improvement, and I fear for the life of firms 
that do not adopt modern tools of quality improvement, and then turn 
and fight.  Let me quote from the recent MIT study of the automobile's
future:

	"the 1990s will be a decade of intense tension" as Western producers
	shift to "lean production" (using Deming's quality techniques, and 
	the Japanese method of unending quality improvement, "kaizen").  

	The ultimate success or failure of its implementation in the West
	will determine "the fate of nations."

	* U.S. producers are improving quality and productivity, but
	  until they institute lean production methods on a widespread 
	  basis, they will continue to lag Japan.

 	* European producers are even further behind, with quality
	  and productivity improvements at a virtual standstill in
	  many countries and little incentive to abandon current
	  mass-production methods.


	Sorry for the thesis, but I feel intensely about both Porsches,
and our need to utilize quality improvement tools to compete (with the
Japanese).

Porsche's problem in the mid-price market isn't that hard to understand.  To
sell a car in that market with the kinds of margins which can be had, means that
a company selling several tens of thousands units a year cannot make ends meet,
ie, pay not only for the production but also the research, tooling, and other
quasi-fixed costs.  The Autoweek article quoted some figure like $315M to
develop a new model line.

Porsche also suffers from consumer ignorance, which is sad.  This ignorance lies
in how people evaluate a car.  Porsche builds in not only reliability, but the
world's best brakes, a terrific transmission, and an amazing suspension.  Yet
the great majority of purchasers look only at how many horsepower the car has,
or if they're real clever, 0-60 figures.  The other manufacturers skimp on these
sorts of things, enhancing their margins.  Too bad.  There cars don't go around
corners real fast, when they start, but they sell real good.

Things are not so grey to my thinking, though.  If you look at the course of
Porsche's history, they have never stayed anywhere too long.  Models come and go
(even if they're called "356" or "911"), and race cars comes and go.  The
current CART effort is hardly Porsche's first "disaster" at racing.

Financially, this is an unbelievably wonderful time for the potential Porsche
owner.  Yeah, the showroom is scarey, but there are so many pristine "pre-owned"
cars on the market at rock-bottom prices!  Last I heard, dealers won't even take
951's at wholesale book in trade.

Smile!  I hate these sorts of morbid conversations, and will not say anything
further.

	$40K sports cars is *not* a lucrative market today?
I think so, else everyone wouldn't want a piece of the action.
Sure, they can be subsidized by profits from other, lesser cars 
that they draw attention to, and "rub off" on (e.g., Corvette).
But as a sports car company, Porsche hasn't exactly been hurting 
in the recent past, have they?

	Cars *can* be made much more cheaply, to improve profit 
margins while delivering better performance/price.  Experience with 
implementation of quality techniques suggests that there's a 
*lot* of waste in existing design and mfg processes. 
GOOD NEWS: This means that producers and consumers can both profit, 
by systematic reduction of waste (improvement of efficiency).  
(Hope that cheers you up a bit, KG: performance/dollar *can* 
significantly improve in the years ahead.  I just hope that this
will be true at Porsche, as well as Honda).

	And I still think the 911 is ugly :-)

	I don't know if this is of interest to anyone, but here is an X
bitmap for the Porsche crest. If you are not running X, sorry ! I can also
translate it to ASCII if anyone would like - mail me if so
(PKatz@axion.bt.co.uk).

----------------------------Original message----------------------------

Recently, my research has taken me into the realms of image compression,
so I have begun to collect interesting images.  Of particular interest to
this group are 2 Porsche crest bitmaps (one monochrome, the other 4 color)
that were posted to alt.sources a while back, and numerous GIF files (911
Targa, 928, 930, 944 GTP, 951).  I would be happy to make these available
to anyone who wants them.  And, I was wondering if anyone else had any
wonderful Porsche pictures.  I would particularly like to find pictures
of a 959, 956/962, and/or any of the Porsche Indycars (what is the project
number?).  Unfortunately, I don't have a color digitizer, or I would
already have filled my image disk partition several times over. :-)
Anyone else out there with pictures?

Ok, here's the oppurtunity for all you holier-than-thou 944 and 911
owners to snicker at a 924 owner.  The reasons mentioned above are
just a few of the reasons I looked at 924's when I went car shopping
a few years ago.  Ok.  Porsche went rummaging thru VW/Audi parts bins
to build the car.  The design is beautiful, though.  The brakes will
still bring it to a smoky-tired, impending lockup stop when brakes on
other cars are faded beyond use and their wide-eyed drivers are fish
tailing into the weeds.  The suspension, despite being composed of
dirt cheap parts, still handles better than 95% of the cars on the
road.  I can't count the number of times I've been tempted to use the
Richard Welty (any relation, Christopher?) recommended technique of
driving around the outside of other cars on freeway on-ramps.

It's not going to win a lot of drag races at stop lights, but that
isn't where the car or the driver(me) is at home.  Gimme a winding
mountain road any day.  The shift linkage is so clean an precise that
you'd swear the transmission is in the center hump right behind the
engine.  How many people, even in transverse front drivers, can say
that?  And it is nice to know that I'll have to hold the key in the
start position for one second, once, to get the engine fired.

All this on a 13 year old car with 140,000+ miles on it.  And as far
as I know, the head has never been pulled.  No reason to, it still shows
140-155 psi on all cylinders.

Yeah, in time, I'll buy another Porsche ... if I can afford to.

As long as we're talking about the prettiest Porsche...
   the one with the cleanest lines:  totally hidden headlights,
   no unsightly fender bulges (afterthought steroids),
   no tack-on (tacky?) wings, foils, or spoilers,
   no extra intakes or outtakes (for burps and belches?),
   and no double chin (jutting fiberglass spoiler)...

   the one with the lowest Cd (small frontal area & narrow tires help)...

   the one with enough luggage space for a comfortable X-country trip for 2...

   the one without power anything (who's idea was it to put power-everything
      into sportscars, and why did Porsche jump on the bandwagon??)...

...all in one car!  Simple, clean, elegent, efficient.

I do think 924S's and 924T's are prettier than the 924, but I prefer the
appearance of any of the 3 to that of a 914, 911/2, 928, or 944.  Just don't
look under the hood.  The Japanese never did copy the 911, but there are
many 924-inspirations.  Flattery, flattery.  

Now.....is there such a thing as the ugliest (streetcar) Porsche?
My vote is the 930:  all afterthoughts and antisocial suggestions.

I don't know whether these are among the GIF files Bert has, 
but here are the ones included in the public archive on
wuarchive.wustl.edu (available via anonymous FTP):

porsche2        A red Porsche           320x200 C32     Cars

When you get into the graphics/gif directory, the files are
arranged into subdirectories alphabetically. So the first
three of these would be in the "numbers" directory, while
the others should be in "c" and "p" respectively.

Thanks for the update on PCA racing.  I'd forgotten about it.

I'm all for it, but only after some questions are answered regarding positioning
and "marketing" of the series.

For instance, you mentioned concern for what'll happen with current PCA
instructors.  Good point, we need enough to keep the driver's schools happy.  Of
course, we currently have a swollen black/red run group in Zone 1, so maybe some
trimming would be OK.

Also, if it's going to be like a vintage race, i.e., no wild passing, bumping,
crashing, or maybe even pushing too hard, then how is it different from PCA
schools?  The only differences I can think of is passing in corners, competitive
vs. non-competive (i.e., there's a "winner"), and format (one 30-120 minute race
instead of 4 20 minute "education sessions").  There needs to be a clear
difference and obvious advantage in the race series over the schools to warrant
the series, in my mind.  Otherwise we just blur what the intentions of each
event are.

Well, this morning's email was unexpected!  I couldn't wait to get my 2 cents
in.  Or is it 3 pfennigs (sp)?

I like that we all have opinions and viewpoints on Porsche AG (the heck with
Reno).  I think we all have the facts pretty straight but we're putting
different emphasis on various areas of concern.

I've never heard the name Deming in relation to Porsche.  But whenever I examine
Porsche's methods from the field, they seem to have a slight Deming flavor (real
slight).  Unfortunately their way of doing statistical analysis is to build
10,000 cars with a bug, get lots of warranty claims, and then redesign the part.
In the case of 944 engine mounts, it was several hundred dollars per car.  With
951 exhaust manifolds, it was several thousand dollars per car.

I don't think they have many production or manufacturing related failures.
Porsche does have design/testing failures that cost them millions and anger the
vehicle owners.  I have a friend on his 5th exhaust manifold!  In any event,
applying Deming techniques would improve the quality and reduce the warranty
cost, both direct and indirect (lost customers).  The net effect is more money
in Porsche's pocket and the consumer's.  Sounds like a win-win!  But those
Germans can be proud and stubborn, so who knows what they're up to.

Hey, let's get somebody from Weissach on this mailing list!

On the subject of product pricing and positioning, some simple economics can
illustrate Porsche's situation.  Aside from the stock sale a few years ago,
their income is from Weissach engineering and automobile sales.  Racing
sponsoship underwrites race car/team development and doesn't produce much
income, if any, I believe.  The engineering services are a whole different ball
of wax and produce a stable/flat income, so let me examine automobile production
only.

Porsche needs a certain level of income/cash flow to stay in business, and more
to develop new products.  They are a very small company with low sales figures. 
Some of you already know about product production and sales, but let me give two
short examples to illustrate my point.

Each vehicle sold has a sales price and a cost to produce.  The difference
between the two is profit.  At the low end, say a 924S, in 1986 it might've cost
$14,000 to produce and sold to the dealer for $17,000, yeilding $3K profit.  If
they sell 10,000, that's $30 million profit.

But if they make a Carrera 2/4 at the high end of the market for $40,000 and
sell it for $60,000, they now have $20,000 profit per unit.  With the volume of
that product line (10K-25K), they stand to make perhaps $200-$500 million
profit.  This is the fundamental reason for wanting to move up-market: the
margins are huge!  Porsche needs these margins to stay in business, since they
aren't diversified enough to have income from other areas help their bottom
line.

It's not wise that a company should have to tap cash reserves for normal
business usage, such as product development.  They do that to an extent, but it
should be limited.  It's like tapping your savings or investments to pay the
monthly bills.  It's OK at tuition time, but not at electric bill time [this of
course is my own judgement - I'm sure some people do tap savings to pay their
bills but I wouldn't agree that it's a favorable thing for a corporation to do].
Porsche recently finished a $300 million capital improvement at the factory, so
their cash position may be depressed between that and the loss of so much U.S.
market income a couple years ago.

OK, so that's the economic justification.  Market-wise, it's less tangible.  I
love Porsches, but have to admit that the 300ZX Turbo is a very competitive car
for lots less money.  Also, the new MR2 comes to mind.  And there are many
others these days.  The point is that Porsche is over-priced for most consumers
- the dollar/value relationship isn't perceived as very good.  Of course, what
most consumers don't know or need is that the car is virtually a race-ready
vehicle, with a fantastic suspension and brakes, grade 8 anodized hardware
everywhere, a zinc treated body with a 10 year rust warranty, and more!  Porsche
has performance under the skin, in the material quality.  That's what we pay for
that doesn't come in the rice burners.

Porsche can't be competitive with Japan Inc. due to the higher material quality
and cost of business/production in Germany.  And I don't think they want to be,
which is why they're moving up-scale with their products.  Porsche, Ferrari,
etc. didn't get their fine names by building a car that lots of people could
afford.  Porsche doesn't want consumers to think of Nissan, Acura, etc. in the
same light at their revered marque.

Comments?  Opposing or supporting views?

I disagree that Porsche should necessarily produce cars to compete with
the Japanese.  Firstly, I think they would fail if they tried.  Secondly,
they don't anyway, on price or quality.  They compete with the likes
of Ferrari, not Nissan.  How many buyers who have had an introduction to
Porsche seriously decide between a 300ZX and even a 944 S2 (where money
isn't the most important criterion)?  I want to be able to afford
something other than the 944 I have, but that's life.

Porsche tried the down market with the 924, and found it was not fruitful
territory.  I agree.

I posted a while back asking for hints on buying a 914.  I thank every
last one of you who responded... every bit of information was helpful!

I bought a '74 914 2.0 (orange!) with center console.

I have the owner's manual and the Haynes for it.  Any other
recommended reading about maintaining/repairing a 914?  Hints about
what to check/ replace on a new (to me) 914?  The previous owner
didn't baby it, but he had it maintained (clutch, brakes, tuneups,
etc.)

What engine oil (brand/weight) should I put in it?  I presume the
owner's manual suggests single weight because multi-grade was rare in
'74.  Maybe this is a bad assumption?  How do I clean the oil screen?
Detergent?  Paint thinner?  Kerosene?

The battery tray is a bit rusty, but everything underneath it looks
intact.  Should I treat the tray?  With what?

I am interested in making it a FUN car, and not necessarily an
all-original car.  I'm excited about it!

thanks again for all your help so far,

Just to stir up some trouble, I thought I'd send everyone my comments on which
oil to use for Robert Merithew.

Any good quality 10W-40 oil should be fine.  Your weather rarely gets down to
freezing, so I wouldn't bother with a 5W-30.  You could use it just fine if
you'd like but I wouldn't be too worried.

The only thing you have to do with oil is change it, change it, change it! 
Contemporary oils are so good that the only reason to change them is that they
get dirty and contaminated.  Always change the filter along with the oil.

If you really want to get esoteric, you could use Mobil 1 15W-50 in the summer
and 5W-30 in the winter, but that goes for around $3.50 - $4.00 / quart.  This
would be a waste for you in my opinion, however.  Mobil 1 makes sense for
turbocharged cars and those that get raced a fair amount.  Mobil 1 does have
better thermal stability than conventional oils, and it's high-rpm shear
characteristics are superior too.  It's no better at providing lubrication,
though.

That's all I have to offer - I hope other folks can give you general 914 tips.

and join up. They are at:

        914 Owners Association
        611 So. Palm Canyon Dr. #7, Suite 165
        Palm Springs, CA 92264

You also want to buy their "Roadside Companion", which has a wealth of info
on things that go wrong and how to fix them.

I'd also suggest getting a catalog and "Helpful Hints" publication from
Automobil Atlanta. And, subscribe to VW & Porsche Magazine, and Excellence
(incidently, you can find a ton of people selling neat 914 parts and 
accessories in the ads in those two mags as well).

	What engine oil (brand/weight) should I put in it?  I presume the
	owner's manual suggests single weight because multi-grade was rare in
	'74.  Maybe this is a bad assumption?  How do I clean the oil screen?
	Detergent?  Paint thinner?  Kerosene?

I always always always use 20/50W in air cooled engines. I like Kendall and 
Castrol, in order, but we went through the oil brand names Jihad not so long
ago here.....

Clean your screen with any solvent you like, as long as you let it dry
when you're done. I like Brake Cleaner solvent, as it goes away almost
instantly and will cut through any crud you can imagine. 
	
	The battery tray is a bit rusty, but everything underneath it looks
	intact.  Should I treat the tray?  With what?

It can be easily replaced, or there is paint now that claims to 
turn rust to primer fairly easily. 
	
	I am interested in making it a FUN car, and not necessarily an
	all-original car.  I'm excited about it!

Get Bilstein shocks, Yoko tires, the biggest sway bar you can find and
4 point harnesses. Oh yeah, and a good stereo with lots of fast tunes! 
Now go out and humiliate a few CRX's and RX-7's.......
	
	thanks again for all your help so far,

p.s. Page mill Rd is the best place to do this humiliation routine....
