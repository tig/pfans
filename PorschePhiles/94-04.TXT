Barry,

I recommend getting a 24x36" sheet of four-to-an-inch stainless steel
mesh from Pegasus.  Yes, you really ought to protect your expensive
Ruf oil cooler.  I have installed this over my car's oil and water
radiators, and we use it on our race car too.  It looka good, doesn't
rust, and keeps a large stone from ruining your cooler, thus engine,
thus day.

Folks,

Eight-valve 944 DME's are not adaptive.  The sixteen-valvers have the
ML.3 Bosch Motronic (I think that's the right series name), which is
indeed adaptive.  Ditto for the 928S4, and I expect late model 911-series
cars.

Probst, in his fine book, mentions that Buick GNX owners would "unlearn"
their car's DME's at the drag strip, and that netted them a performance
gain.  I don't know how much of a difference it makes for them, and
have even less of an idea when it comes to Porsches.

Jim, 
How long would the air stay in the cooling system?  After I last changed the
coolant, I bled the air out quickly and then drove the car.  When it cooled
down the coolant was down in the expansion tank so I topped it off.  I assumed
that this was a sufficient method of bleeding.  I didn't think that bubbles could
stay trapped inside the engine after it had been operated for some time.

From: reid_zeigler@merck.com (Reid Zeigler)
The only thing that
keeps it (fuel pump) from cooking itself or starting a fire is lack
of oxygen. By oxygenating the fuel are they providing
enough to prematurely fry the brushes from arcing?

=======
Fuel pump burnout is typically from overheating,yes.
The burning out the insulation on it windings and
 resultant short outs is the villan.
Oxygen is not really a requirment for that situation.

(keep that FP cool, be sure that full flow is taking place
to the fuel rail AND back to the tank; change filter(s) @2yrs or less)

Oxygenated fules; MTBE and ethyl alcohol.
The oxygen is in the molecule is   not free oxygen O2.  
the oxygen is released during the heat of combustion
so it does not create a corosion problem in the
tank (unless it sits around for months and begins
to decompose)

Methyl Alcohol is a much stronger solvent than
Ethyl Alcohol so it should not be used, as the
owners manual clearly states.
(strong solvent=disolved gaskets, o-rings, injector innards.)

Incidentally, I have been using Ethyl Alcohol 
ever since I got my 951 (70k mi, 120k total) and have never had
a problem related to fuel.  Although the 
higher RON-MON is good I get slightly less
fuel economy with Alcohol (less energy in a gal of alcy)_

Snake oil. Purely snake oil.

Bottom line: he's selling you expensive copies of stuff you already have.
It may actually improve performance on ancient carb'ed Chevies, but it

Note that his expertise, like that of so many others, is self proclaimed.

Note also that Performance Products, much like European Car magazine, is
necessarily *MUCH* less interested in truth, rigtheousness, and real
performance than it is in margins. MSD units (one of the few non-Bosch
ignitions I'd consider -- and THEIR claims are snake oil over about 4k RPM) 
are readily available at *HUGE* discounts in the stock car world, so no 
margins there. Electromotive (the other non-Bosch unit I *really* like)
is only available from Electromotive unless you get it installed at one
of their value-added resellers so that's out (caveat: this is based on my 
last conversation with Electromotive, about 18 months ago, when I was trying 
to get the South Texas territory for their products; it may not be the case 
any longer, but I *NEVER* see Electromotive systems advertised ala carte...)
Allison doesn't *DO* Porsche, so what does that leave? I KNOW !!! Let's sell
Jacobs....

Moral: something being in a catalog is *NOT* any kind of endorsement. In
fact, it may be just the opposite...

Felix, thanks for your help.  I've received a number of different ideas from
various people on where and how to mount my CD changer. Unfortunately, some of
them, including yours, wil not work for me because my Sony CDX-U303 10-isc
changer is too big.  In fact, if I want to hide it, I'll have to give up my
spare tire, since that is really the only space that is big enough for this
unit.  Rather than doing this, I've decided to mount the unit vertically against
the front of the left rear seat.  This means that anyone sitting behind the
driver will have to be careful with his/her legs, and it also means that the
unit will be visible.  The former I can live with, since I'm never the passenger
B-).  The latter, I think I will solve by devising some sort of cover that I can
drape over the unit to hide it.

For anyone else contemplating getting a CD changer, I recommend investigating
one of the new micro-sized 6-disc units.  These can be mounted in the left or
right compartments behind the rear wheels.  I also recommend getting something
that can be mounted at any angle.  This will make your life *much* easier.

Subject: Rebuilding 914 2.0L engine

I now have my spare engine all apart, and (miraculously!) it appears quite
rebuildable; a happy event for a seized engine which had been sitting for
at least five years.

I'd like to make the engine reliable, so I want to make sure that I replace
all the little itty bitty pieces inside that I need to.  Thus, I'd like to
offer the following list for the collective wisdom and comment of the
Porschephiles:

	Bearings		replace
	Camshaft		(being replaced by Scat FI cam)
	Cam followers		replace
	Pushrods		keep
	Pushrod tubes & seals	replace
	Rocker arms		keep
	Crank, rods		keep & balance
	Pistons & cylinders	replace
	Flywheel		keep, balance & lighten
	Valves			keep (?)
	Valve guides		replace
	Valve springs		replace (?)
	Valve adjust lugs/nuts	?

Are there are other parts I should replace, regardless of their wear 
status?  I'm especially concerned about whether I should replace the
valves, given their cost -- they look OK, but is that good enough?

All advice highly appreciated -- thanks in advance!

Since you are in the Chicago area, there are two much less expensive
ways to get email than compuserve.  MCS Net and CHI NET. I have

I dropped an old used 356 fan off at Rimco yesterday. They weld every other
tab; so of the four tabs holding each blade in, say the upper left and lower
right tabs are welded. Then the whole thing is balanced. They'll weld all
the tabs if you so desire, but at a higher price.
 
Derek van Veen asked privately if a fix is required for a Type III. Rimco
says they don't know of a history of exploding Type IIIs, but they have on
occasion been asked to weld the hubs in, just in case.

Subject: 968 Overheats? (Maybe)

 
Hi - first real msg to the list so if I'm doing s/g wrong go easy on me! <g>
I've had a '94 968 (Coupe) for about 6 months and it has always run on the
hot side - i.e. needle touches the upper mark, at about 10 o'clock, but
never hits the red which is at about 11.  It's been getting worse.
 
Bruce Anderson said I should run the AC to kick in the second fan and that
helps, but only to a degree - lately it's been getting up there even if the
AC is on, and regardless I don't really want the AC on all the time.
 
The dealership says that as long as it doesn't hit the red is totally
normal, it's a "porsche thing".   Is this true?  This being my first
porsche, I'm used to having the temp gauge not much higher then 9 oclock.
My fear is that I'm hurting the engine, and I'm in love with this car and
plan to keep if for a long while.
 
On another topic, am I the only one left in the list with a 968?  This car
is *fantastic*! (even if is not a 911 <g>).  It replaces a '93 TT Rx-7, and
there is just no comparison between the two cars.

Anthony,  the 944 series engine has an air pocket that won't bubble-out 
through the resevoir, and takes a long time (in my experience) to 
completely exit the bleed valve at the engine front/center.  Short of 
X-raying or ultra-sounding the thing (!), I find it takes a relatively 
long time to get a strong, even coolant flow from the bleed valve atop 
the motor.  Revving the engine during the process helps kick air 
pockets around, but they never seem to be able to get to the expansion 
tank.  "Burps" emanating from the valve indicate little bubbles.

Try this: warm the car by driving, then open the valve slowly and 
carefully (hot coolant!) enough to check the coolant stream.  Observe 
it for about a half minute while revving the engine up and down.  The 
flow should never stop, though it may back off as revs drop.  Any 
sudden stoppage, start/stop, or bubbling indicates air.

Normal temp gauge activity is a slow rise, followed by a somewhat 
quicker fall once the fans engage.  There should be virtually no 
rise/fall related *only* to RPMs.  (Yah, increased water flow results 
in increased cooling, but not in an amount that you'll notice on the gauge).

Most cars don't work this way; it's something we have to put up with to 
own the beasts!

Hope this helps,

It's your money, but of the few people I know who have spent
their cash on these systems for "brand X" cars, no one noticed
any improvement of any kind, other than better acceleration
due to the reduce weight of their wallet.

I would guess that if your ignition system was really in sad
shape, anyones new system would work better.

I have a REAL hard time buying his "optimum spark" theory. I'm
no expert, but I can see no benefit to a variable spark based
on conditions. I guess I'm just a wasteful individual that
prefers the hottest possible spark at all times.

Subject: Fuel fumes in a '911

I have a '78 911 Targa, and I've begun to notice a strong fuel smell in 
the car, particularly after it's been sitting for a while.  The worst 
was about two weeks ago when I took the top off and drove it.  Instead 
of warm spring air, it smelled like a refinery.  The smell went away 
after a day or so.  Later, I checked around under the hood, the fuel 
lines look good, there are no obvious leaks and I didn't smell 
anything.  Last night I got in the car to get something, noticed the 
smell again.  The steering wheel also seems to have gas fumes in it, as 
my hands smell like gas after driving.  I'm wondering if the gas vapor 
is impregnating the leather wheel...

Has anyone else experienced something like this?  Any clues on where to 
look for a possible leak in the fuel system?

OK, now we're getting somewhere, albeit slowly.
 
This all started when Pellow claimed that his street stock engines, in the
form in which he sells them to customers, will peg the tach (6000 rpm) and
speedo (120 mph). I claim they won't due a true 120 mph, not with his lowered
compression ratio and cam giving more low-end torque, and challenged him to
prove it with an instrumented top speed run on a desert road.
 
The challenge was really very simple, and I want to keep it that way. Your
road car against my road car. Top speed measured by my equipment (proof of
calibration onsite if desired, with 1000 ft. calibration test section and
radar gun). Car with higher top speed wins. Top speed is two-way
average; go down drive, stop, turn around, come right back, hand in paper
printout showing max speed reached in each direction and rpm at max speed. The
driveway is about 4 miles long for our purposes, about 2 lanes wide (1 each
way), loose gravel on surface and bumpy in spots. There is a dry lake bed on
either side, so if you go off you will have the world's longest accident.
Suggest you bring Nomex and helmet, and good tires. There is occasionally a
crosswind.

	Actually, the float level may affect the mixture. When the needle in the SU 
	moves up because of vaccum changes, it exposes an ever larger opening for 
	gas to flow through. I would guess that the amount of gas going through the

Kevin,
Could you please elaborate a bit on this.  I don't see how an uneven
pushing surface can help equalize pad wear.

Anybody care to start the anti-Armorall debate again for the newcomers?
Basically, as I remember it, it came down to just say no to
Armorall..

As for dash repairs, I have 3 companies in my files that recover
your dash with new material for about $300-$350.  Much nicer than
the coverlay fix and cheaper than a new dash.

This "Porsche thing" is nonsense!  Compare your car to a few other 
968's, maybe at the dealer or at some PCA event.  If yours runs 
significantly warmer, I'd say you have a problem.  DO NOT let the 
dealer B.S. you into thinking this is normal - you might end up with a 
warped head (on the motor)!

Great for turbo cars, where they kick up the boost.  Minor improvement 
for aspro's, especially those with variable cam timing, like the 968.  
I'd suggest saving your money or spending it on something with even 
better payback: a driving school.

OK, I'm going to make an assumption here, and if I'm wrong, correct me.
That assumption is: you are building a street car which *MAY* see some
limited use as an autox car, but that's not your primary intent. You would
like reasonable performance, but that's not as importance as reliability.
And, you've never done this before....

> 	Bearings		replace
> 	Camshaft		(being replaced by Scat FI cam)

*PLEASE* re-read my posting from yesterday. Send the SCAT cam back, get
a FI cam from FAT Performance (in the FAQ, I believe). They have two --
get the one that's closest to stock. You also will need a cam gear, since
the stock gear is riveted on. Get that from FAT too. *AND* (this is important,
so listen up!) you have to have *SPECIAL* bolts. The bolts that SCAT would
send you should you do business with them are *TOO TALL*; the head protrudes 
and scrapes the back of the oil pump. FAT sells you the right "shortened" 
bolts. They are one-time-only bolts, so get the camshaft on the gear right
the first time!!!!

> 	Cam followers		replace

Yes. Also from FAT. 

> 	Pushrods		keep
> 	Pushrod tubes & seals	replace

Yes. Absolutely.  Use grease, not RTV on those seals -- they are *SUPPOSED*
to slip with engine expansion as it heats up...

> 	Rocker arms		keep
> 	Crank, rods		keep & balance

Yes. Well, kinda. You *FIRST* have them checked for cracks, straightness,
etc. then they get balanced, along with the pistons&wristpins, the flywheel&
pressure plate, and fan. If you *REALLY* want better reliability, spend the 
extra $200 and have your crank counterweighted. If you can't find someone to 
do that in your neck of the woods, shoot me a note. I have a guy down here
who does very good work. He can also make a 1.[78] crank into a 2.0 crank
at the same time, same price... Rods may also need to be re-bushed.

> 	Pistons & cylinders	replace

Maybe. If they're worn, absolutely. If not, then it's up to you. People
for *YEARS* just routinely replaced them "because that's what you do on
VWs". Yeah, right. Type I P & C, stock, are like $89. Type IV 2.0 are
like $400+ stock, and if you get the European P & Cs (which you should
if you're adding a cam and would like a little more performance) then
that's more like $600.  Don't do any of the "big bore" kits if reliability
is a concern.

> 	Flywheel		keep, balance & lighten

Don't lighten too much -- more than about 4 lbs off that sucker and you'll
really regret it... When you balance it, do that with your clutch pressure
plate attached, BTW...

> 	Valves			keep (?)

Maybe. Check for wear within tolerance, and look at them. If they're
pitted, look burned, or if you're just paranoid, then replace them.
If you replace them, use the *RIGHT* sodium filled exhaust valves.
Zims usually has the best prices for civilians, about $80 a valve for
exhaust and $40 for intake. Stay with stock valve size, too.

For race motors, there's *NO* question -- replace them. For street motors,
I dunno. *I'd* replace them, but there are people who don't every day...

> 	Valve guides		replace
> 	Valve springs		replace (?)

If you replace them, use the *SINGLE* heavy-duty springs from FAT. Dual
springs are evil, as they require you to trim the valve boss, significantly
weakening the head.

> 	Valve adjust lugs/nuts	?

Again, depends on wear. I routinely just replace them, but you can keep
the old without significant problem if they're in reasonable shape.

> Are there are other parts I should replace, regardless of their wear 
> status?  I'm especially concerned about whether I should replace the
> valves, given their cost -- they look OK, but is that good enough?

Yes. With a nice, fresh rebuild, you should go ahead and replace *ALL* of
the FI rubber parts -- the air intake boot, the little gizmos between the
air runners and the main plenum, all of the hoses, all of the vaccuum lines,
etc. I also *HIGHLY* recommend replacing the injectors. A fresh set of 
injectors with a correct spray pattern makes a world of difference in the
way the car will run. Also, check the second set of points on the distributor.
They should be about ready to get replaced by now...

You also left off rings (yes), the misc. timing gears on the crankshaft (maybe
depending on wear), oil cooler (maybe, if the previous engine exploded or 
dumped cruft into the oil then yes, otherwise, if it cleans out and pressure
tests OK, no), oil pump (depends -- if going to an external oil cooler, or
if you think you might at some point, then yes, replace with a FAT heavy-duty
pump, otherwise, depends on wear), wrist pins (maybe), and seals (absolutely).

Subject: Re: 924S/944 Cooling systems 

Jim,
Two questions:

1) Do you suspect that the rapid drop (15 seconds or so) in temperature
that I am seeing when I rev the engine from idle could be a symptom of a weak
water pump and not a symptom of air in the system.  Somewhere I read that to
check the water pump you should squeeze the large upper radiator hose while
the engine is running and hot.   There should be the feeling of coolant
re-filling the empty hose.  When I tried this I did not get any conclusive
feeling about the preasure of the coolant in the hose.  I am a little
concerned in general given that my water pump is the original with about
70K miles on it.

2) When you bleed the system by opening the bleeding valve how long do you leave
it open.  Particularly how long past the last "burp" to you wait until closing
it.

Thanks,
AAW

  The talk about the Allison and MSD systems.. does the allison system

  The MSD system..6AL model, does it include a point replacement module?
  somthin' like reluctor/pickup?  Who would be a good vendor for a system?

  I see MSD makes an uprated model more suited for harsh environment.
  If i get a 6AL and crack it open..can i fortify its innards to

When the car is cold, shifting from 1st to 2nd requires a bit more effort than 
when it's warmed up.  I've got a new clutch so that's not the problem.  Correct 
me if I'm wrong but would using a synthetic oil such as Red-Line in the 
transmission reduce this effect.

I've installed an alarm in my '86 951 and would like to include a starter 
disable (which the alarm is wired for).  Now, the factory wiring diagrams show 
an optional starter interlock between the ignition switch and the Central 
Electric for 944's with auto transmission (for those of you with diagrams, it's 
on Model 86 Sheet 7 at K45).  Those of us with manual trannies don't require 
this starter lockout, but it would be nice to take advantage of it for the 
alarm.  The question is, if this connection has a jumper, where in the wiring 
harness (i.e. under the centre console)  would it be, or does it exist at all in 
the loom of manual tranny cars?

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What can you tell me about the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          President, NetSmiths, Ltd.
          2025 Lincoln Highway
          Edison, NJ 08817

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How is the list maintained?
     
     The list is maintained fairly regularly.  Stan tries to handle
changes at least once every other day.  There will probably be times
when he's on the road and less able to deal with problems, so be
patient.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  You can also 
reach Stan by phone at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070 when he's not
traveling.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What about Unix-based mail problems with the list?

     If you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay attention to 
your replies.  The default will send the reply to the "porschephiles-
request" address, as it is the UUCP "From" address (first actual line 
of the mail header).  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT STAN ROUTINELY TRASHES SUCH 
MIS-ROUTED MAIL!  If your mailer starts screwing up, you will be dropped
from the list.  Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any 
more, send Stan mail and he will do his best to figure out what's
happening.

     The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence

*NOT* a bulletin board system, where consent for further redistribution

Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing
up down the line.  Remember, when you read something on this list: what
you are reading belongs to whoever wrote it.  They may have plans to
publish it further themselves.  They may want to keep it "private"
(i.e. just for list member use).  They may not care what gets done with
it.  It's still theirs, and before re-use, permission must be
obtained.  Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a
big deal about it.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available via FTP at tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/
Archives in five subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94) each of which has 
the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  Period!!!  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM
CST, or Stan may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to
mail you archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to
use BINARY mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX
"uncompress" program, or equivalent, to restore to textual format.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What else is available in the tta.com archives in /pub/porschephiles?

     FAQs: This FAQ; also specific FAQs about specific Porsche models
are being added (so far there's only one, for the 914--feel free to
contribute one on YOUR favorite Porsche).
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
            1970.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914, 1976.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
            of the four-cylinder engine.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 as the 924S with the 944 drivetrain.
            Has the best aerodynamic shape of any Porsche.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the
            front, water-cooled, has grown from an original 4.5 litres 
            to 5.4 today.
     930  - Turbocharged 911, homologation and street version of the
            racing 934.
     931  - Turbocharged 924, sold in 1980-1982.
     944  - Front-engined, water-cooled inline four cylinder car, with
            nearly perfect 50/50 weight bias.  Sixteen-valve and
            turbocharged versions were produced.  Produced from 1982
            through 1991. 2.5 litre displacement, except for a 2.7 litre
            eight-valve 944 model in 1989 and the 3.0 litre 944S2.
     951  - The turbo version of the 944.  Built from 1985 to 1991.
     959  - Supercar 911 derivative.  2.85 litre, four valve, twin cam,
            dual turbochargers, all-wheel drive.
     964  - Another name for the 911 Carrera 4 and Carrera 2 as introduced
            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, due in showrooms in 4/94.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What are the meanings of terms and acronyms I've seen in the list?

     FAQ  - Frequently asked questions (but you knew that)
     FWIW - For what it's worth
     IMHO - In my humble opinion
     IMO  - In my opinion
     PCA  - Porsche Club of America, the major US/Canada Porsche
            enthusiasts organization
     POC  - Porsche Owner's Club, the *other* US Porsche owner's group;
            in the past they have been more competition-oriented than 
            PCA, which has many interest groups participating
     PCGB - Porsche Club of Great Britain
     PCNA - Porsche Cars of North America (Reno, NV), the US importer
     PANO - Not an acronym; this stands for Porsche Panorama, the PCA 
            national monthly magazine
     PAG  - Porsche AG, the mother company back in Stuttgart; "AG"
            stands for "Aktiengesselschaft," which means that the 
            company has publicly traded stock
     YMMV - Your mileage may vary
     :-)  - Smiley face (turn your head 90 degrees to the left to "read"
            it); various iterations exist using different ASCII 
            characters

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:
Information about water-cooled cars is lacking; those with favorites
should submit them to one of the names at the end of this FAQ.)

Haynes manuals tend to be very weak on specifics having to do with
different model years and variations, they are good at teaching how-to
procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other well-known Porsche people) here?
 
     Bruce was invited to join and did so back in '91. The load then
was too much for him.  All of what, 2k a day or so.  Now, at 15x to 20x
that load, he probably doesn't want back on.  He's not stupid -- he 
knows where we are.

     No specifics are available regarding other renowned Porsche people.

Subject: "por-shu" or "porsh"


Boy am I going to open a can of worms!!!
This morning on Today show PCNA chairman was on with the
substitute weatherman and had a new Carrera Cabriolet!
It was very nice! The weatherman pronounced porsche "porsh"
3 times ! I have also heard Jackie Ickx say "porsh" when he
was a factory driver.

So, any comments? (stupid question)

Pull back the carpet and see if the area around the fuel level sensor is wet.
 If it is, buy a new gasket for the fuel sensor and repalce it.  They dry out
over the years, shrink and leak.

Good day folks,
Can anybody point me to a good source of information to troubleshoot the
wiring of a '70 914-6?

I've got some really weird things happening and would like to straighten
them out.

turn signals act strange
dash lights drop the tach to zero

Any of this sound familiar?

Subject: 968 vs Rx-7

 
 
Hi Scott,
 
>> difference between the 968 and Rx-7 <<
 
Well - I owned the Rx-7 for about 6 months before I decided I had to let go
of it, mainly due to the many many problems the car has (had?).  I bought
the car new, and out of the six months it spent about 40 days at the shop!
 
Anything from blowing the turbos (and the resulting mess), bad ECU, oil
trouble, door handle & molding coming off repeatedly, and many other minor
things.  But I loved the car itself, just didn't feel like it was ready for
real life.  The actual sheet metal in some places (doors & around the hood)
was no longer smooth (it was that thin) and no, nobody had been banging on it
or anything.
 
On the bright side the car felt great, had plenty of power and handled very
very well, as I got to find out in some closed roads I know of.  The power
starts early on and the small turbo hands it over to the big one at around
4k, going all the way past 7k with a practically even curve (a powerful one,
to be sure).  The 2nd turbo was abrupt at times and made it a little
unpredictable, particularly in the wet - one could actually start receiving
a boost while downshifting and that was pretty weird.  Great fun car, felt
almost like something you wore.  On the right road it almost felt like
downhill skiing!
 
 
But the 968... it is hard to describe, and of course very subjective.  You
sit in a 968 and start the engine and (just like a 911) the car simply has a
lot of "presence".  It feels like a serious machine right from the solid
sound the door makes as one closes it (a major bug in the Rx-7, BTW: it is
so airtight that one really has to SLAM the door shut, and I really mean
SLAM).
 
The handling of the Rx is excellent, but the 968 is the best I've personally
experienced - the car feels like its planted much more than the Rx, which is
a little to "oversteer happy" (which can actually be a lot of fun).
 
And VarioCam is a kick, too.  Not quite the effect of a turbo, but
definitely a significant and very rewarding one.
 
All in all, the 968 feels much more solid as a package, the Rx-7 at times
could feel like a blender on steroids (no satisfying "groul" from the engine
at all, for what is worth).  And after 6 months, the 968 is still like new,
the Rx looked tired by then.
 
Just my opinions, though.
 
                                                         Ralph

Sounds like you may have a partial vacuum being formed in the reservoir. Try
it with the cap off; if that fixes it, make sure the vent hole is clear (may
be clogged).

Hope this helps...

I'm pretty sure that the CARB has said you can swap Webers for Solexes
on 912s. If you decide to do that, you need to go to (2) below. But
really, he has two choices: 

1) get the Solexes fixed right. Call Brad Ripley at NLA (they run ads in
   Pano, Excellence,etc). He has a carb rebuild program that is very,
   very good. Costs a lot less then new carbs, the look concours, and
   (so far) work great. I had a set done last year, but the timing 
   dictated that I need to install something else while they were away.
   On their return, I elected to keep the carbs I had, and sell those
   to a friend who also has an SC (but his is a Cab, dammmit!). They're
   great. I think his full rebuild is like $3-400, depending on what 
   parts are needed that he doesn't stock.

2) get Webers. Don't screw around with Tweeks, Automotion or Bill-Bob's
   Lawnmower and Flat Four Repair. Go straight to PMO. Again, they advertise
   in the usual places. They usually *DON'T* advertise for the 356s, but
   their price for *EVERYTHING* -- carbs, manifold adapters, K & Ns, etc.
   is like $450. They have the necessary stuff on file with CARB for
   swapping Webers for Zeniths and Solexes on 911s, so I'd bet that they
   have the right stuff for the 912...

Subject: Noise From Rear of 944

I just recently had my wheels refinished and two new front tires mounted (Dunlop
D40M2 215/60 ZR 15 -- thanks to all those who provided me with their insights on
tires and tire sizing.)  Up until this time, I had been running with Yokohama
snow tires for all those runs up to Whistler.

With the newly refinished wheels and summer tires (Pirelli P6 215/60 VR 15 on
the back), I happily went on a nice, long weekend drive.  At first I didn't
notice anything.  However, after turning off the stereo, I noticed a very
distinct rubbing sound coming from the right rear wheel.  Now that I am aware of
the sound, it is obvious to me at at speeds ranging from 20 kph up to the triple
digits, when wind noise drowns it out.

I thought that somehow the tire might be rubbing the body, so I pulled over and
gave all for wheels and tires a very close inspection.  However, I couldn't find
anything.  When I got back in the car and started driving again, I noticed that
I could make the noise disapear by loading up the right side of the car, such as
by making a left turn or by going through a left curve.  On straightaways and
through right hand curves that loaded up the left side of the car, the noise
persisted.  The pitch of the noise goes up and down with wheel speed.

I am thinking of three possibilities: (1) brake rubbing; (2) CV joint; and (3)
wheel bearings.  However, I am still just learning about cars and would welcome
anyone else's diagnosis, together with advice on whether I can attempt the
repairs myself.  Thanks!

>   So i look for Splitfire plugs (which are resistor type) but cant get them

Scott Jessen tried SplitFires, didn't like them. I forget his
exact reasons, but they probably had at least something to do with
the fact that the threads are cut different from the way that Bosch
does it (making for a poor fit in a head expecting a Bosch plug -- *BIG*
problem for lots of US made plugs, and NDs, as well...).

They also have a lot of bullshit in their ads -- once the spark
path is established (per instance) resistance there is effectively
zero, so you *WON'T* get multiple sparks or a significantly larger
spark kernel than a regular plug in good shape.

>   The talk about the Allison and MSD systems.. does the allison system

Allison is a points replacement module only, as seen in the catalogs
anyway. They have more serious stuff, but you gotta look for it...

>   The MSD system..6AL model, does it include a point replacement module?
>   somthin' like reluctor/pickup?  Who would be a good vendor for a system?

MSD has multiple sparks per discharge in low RPM. While advertised to
make more power, etc. I find it's mainly useful to help keep plugs from
fouling. I have a 6AL on my 914 racer, with an MSD coil. It's a nice setup,
but you have to dick around with the tach to make it work right. I don't
recall what all we had to do but it was involved...

As to good vendor, see things like "Circle Track", "Stock Car Racing", etc.
This stuff is way popular in the roundie-round circles (so to speak) and
you find the best discounts there. A 6AL with a program pack for say 6-7k
RPM should be no more than $150.

Nope. It's a marine applications thing, and you really probably can't
replicate it. And probably, don't need it. Unless you're driving that
914 cross-furrow over those plowed fields of Kansas... 8{)

Scott,
  PMO may have an all in one solution (310-393-5423), but if he likes to 
scrounge, e.g. build his own clone systems, etc. he can probably save by 
getting the individual parts at lowest prices.  This is assuming he is 
going to webers, I don't know anything about solex, dellorto, or zenith, 
except how to remove them.

Hi, Scott.

First of all, I would strongly recommend against replacing the Solexes with
Webers. Solexes have been badmouthed for years by self-appointed experts.
They were good enough for Porsche back then, and they can be made to work
perfectly today. The trick is to have them remanufactured, not just cleaned
and re-jetted. The only company I know of that does this correctly is
Eurometrix, in Campbell, CA  Tel. 408-296-1533. He not only replaces all the
little bits, but also rebores and rebushes the throttle shaft, which is the
source of some Solex problems. I have Solexes on my 356 SC, have had them
for 3 years and 50,000 miles, and like them. For an alternative view on
Solex by somebody who likes them, read the article in 356 Registry, "Solex
40PII-4 Vindication," Vol. 16 #1 p. 7. I can fax you a copy. Really
worthwhile for your friend before he drops big bucks in the wrong place.
 
To quote just a part of the article, "...Most of these [Solexes] are being
discarded because they are taking the rap for a crime they didn't commit:
uneven idle.... The horror stories of Solex carbs and their bad throttle
shafts and worn bodies are numerous, embedded deep in the literature of the
Pellowian era...75 % of the Solex carbs I've looked at are in fact good and
should not have been disgracefully fired from their job (usually to be
replaced by Webers that, because of their smaller venturis, actually don't
perform as well as the original Solexes.)"
 
Webers -- most folks who run Webers seem to like dealing with PMO, Santa
Monica, CA, 213 (or maybe 310 by now) 393-5423.
 
The Weber 40s are supposed to be a legal retrofit in CA, the 44s are not.
The problem with Weber 40s is that they have only a 27 mm venturi, while the
Solex has 32 mm, so the engine will be down on power. Another problem is
that they often take a lot of fiddling to jet correctly. Yet another
consideration: venturi to butterfly ratio is different with the 40 Webers.
The Solex is 40/32 = 1.25, the Weber 40 is 1.48, and the 44 is, I think,
again 1.25. The 44 Weber is probably too big unless you have enough engine mods
to need the extra air going into the engine.
 
Trust me, do it right, fix the Solexes, give Eurometrix a call.
 
Pete

From: pfile (Porschephiles Mailer)
Subject: READ THIS! - Monthly Message

April 1994

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

There has been an incredible influx of material on the list that has been
less than useful. Please watch what you're doing. The added volume isn't
helping anyone other than the service providers who charge recipients
for the total volume they're getting.

In particular, don't include whole messages if you need to reference them
to make a point -- just include the relevant parts. It also makes for
better reading if you intersperse what you're saying with what was previously
said -- easier to compare and contrast, etc.

And let's try to keep a lid on things that are inflamatory, OK? We're all 
better off if we don't have to wear Nomex to read this stuff.

And 'tta.com' is moving this weekend. Expect some outages...

COPYRIGHT AND FAIR USAGE STATEMENT

The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence by and between
members of a closed community. As such, the copyright for EVERYTHING that 
ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 7 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.


CLUB-INFO

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, PLEASE join!! 
This info is also on-line in /pub/pca/info, in case you forget to save
this message!

Porsche Club of Americia.
P.O. Box 10402
Alexandria VA 22310

Does take non-US membership. You *MUST* have a Porsche VIN number to join.
+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.
Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy.
Or they'll send you an application which you can mail in with your check.

National membership chairman is Nann Weissenberger who is reachable via

Specialty clubs:

356 Registry Inc.
27244 Ryan Rd. 
Warren, MI, 48092

For 356 enthusiasts around the world. $20 per year and cheap at twice the 
price. (Vic Skirmants' racing column is worth that, as are the classifieds...) 
5000 happy members can't be wrong! 

P.S. You *DON'T* have to own a 356 to join, and if you think you want to
own one, this is the best place to buy. No one seems to expect concours
prices for their cars unless they have a real concours car.

914 Owner's Association

Palm Springs CA 92262

Over 2000 members in over 20 countries. Dennis Deeds published the club
newsletter, Mid-Engined Views, quarterly. Membership is $22 a year.
Again, they don't require you own an 914 to join, but they are interested
in the lowest and highest serial numbers known for each year model.

"S" Registry

Contact Vern Lyle, Box 363,
West Point, PA 19486 (tele (215) 652-7011 (day), (215) 287-5083 (eve). 
Dues are $20/yr with a quarterly newsletter. Dedicated to all early
911S models.

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone

Subject: 914 half shaft

Hey guys,
Well I was all ready to go driving on this fantastic spring day in Pa, and
as I pull out of a parking lot bang. No power. Engines running I seem to
have no gears. Look under car Half shaft is no longar attached to
transmission. Here is the question: I finnaly got it all bolted together,
but I am missing that wimpy little paper gasket that goes between tranny
and the CV joint. I have driven the cat maybe 100 hundred yards since I
have put it back together. How far can I drive the car with out Screwing up
the CV joints. There is a lot of axle grease in them to be thrown out. Is
driving 150 miles out of the question, because that is how far the car is
from home.

>Thanks,
>AAW

Anthony,

I wrote an article for our region's newsletter on the subject last
year, and posted it to the list.  I dunno if it's archived anywhere.

The gist of it is twofold.  First, in the rotational direction, the
friction of the pad against the rotor tends to pivot it about a
radius line drawn from the centre of the rotor.  So, the leading edge
of the pad is effectively pushed harder against the rotor than the
trailing edge, as though the leading edge were "caught" by the rotor.
And so, all other things being equal, you get a little more wear at
the leading edge.

Second, the same friction of the pad against rotor causes the whole
caliper to rotate about the axis of the strut (I think this is
correct; it's from memory).  And this force affects the radial wear
of the pad.

Uncorrected, these and other little aberrations cause uneven wear
of the pads, often referred to as "taper wear".  Pads suffering from
this tend to get knocked back from the rotor as the caliper untorques
when the brakes are released.  This knock back in turn means you have
a somewhat deeper pedal, and if you're on the edge of available
braking at a track event or race, that might be a problem.

The relieved brake piston is an attempt to avoid taper wear by adding
a bit of radial and circumferential bias to pad pressure.  You can
well imagine that the exact bias you need will vary depending on the
brake caliper design, the car, and the strut design.  And so it does.
The system seems to work.

Hope this helps.

Kevin

Dear Peter:



      Some comments on your last missile:



>OK, now we're getting somewhere, albeit slowly.



    Speak for yourself. Personally, I think the

Entertainment value for Porschephiles is now higher than the

Letterman show when Madonna was on. That's a compliment,...

I think.



>This all started when Pellow claimed that his street stock

     Not really. This all started when you, Mr. Albrecht,

jumped on me for  telling that poor guy NOT to try to remove

the fan nut from his  generator/broken fan by holding the

pulley hub in a vice and breaker-baring  off the nut. Can

you say "sheared-off key", or "ruined pulley hub" or

"ruined generator shaft"?  When I said that exploding fans

were fairly rare  as the Maestro's Broken Parts Collection

only has three examples, you said  that must be 'cause my

engines don't go over 4000 RPM. 



Now, really. That wasn't very nice. It also wasn't very True. 



     I have a nice letter from a Satisfied Customer who told

about entering the Massachusetts Turnpike one sunny Sunday,

right next to an early 911. After they got their tickets, they

accelerated together out onto the Turnpike.  And kept

accelerating.  And the 356 kept jusssstt a little ahead of

the 911. And they kept accelerating. And the 356 very

sloooowwwly increased its lead. And when finally that's all

there was, there weren't no more, the guy in the 356 looked

down at the instruments which read 6,000 RPM and 120 MPH.



>The driveway is about 4 miles long for our purposes, about

>2 lanes wide  (1 each way), loose gravel on surface and

>if you go off you will have the world's longest  accident. 



  Ah, yes, do we really want to waste Precious Natural

Resource zooming down  some woman's driveway with "loose

gravel on surface and bumpy in spots". What a great place

for a High-Speed run in a 30+ year old car. Once again the

Maestro flashes on the hero from "Back to the Future",  who

in one time continuum when called Chicken for not drag

racing, instead decides to race and is killed. Stupidity

killed him then, and the Maestro doth believe that Stupidity

Kills, for he's seen many engines  killed, nay, MURDERED by

Stupidity.

 

>No teardowns. I don't have the time. You want to play, fine.

>If not, go away.



    No teardowns? No way to ensure honesty, eh? You want me

to play the game according to your rules, (with no means for

inspection), and your instruments, or go away. I think  that 

Porschephiles oughta vote on the rules- and maybe on who should 

"go away" too.



>No engine claiming. My case is the one that left the factory

>in this car, I intend to keep it, and I don't want one of

>yours.



     Oh, too bad. I was hoping to buy yours to tear down just

to see ifin there be a Story there. Provided, of course, that 

you really did build your engine yourself.



>I'm ready right now. Let's do it on Friday, April 8. Meet

>you in Barstow, say, 9 AM at the Barstow Station

>MacDonald's on Main Street.



   Sorry, but I'll be doing my Income Tax that weekend, like

many millions of patriotic Americans. And, besides, as you

say, "I don't have the time".



    How about we answer people's questions about Porsche

Problems instead? That's what I intend to do.



    And wasn't/isn't that the purpose of Porschephiles anyhow? 



                  KEEPING THE 356 FAITH!!!

I think your dealer tells you 'don't worry be happy'
while there mouth waters at the prospect of a huge

If you want your engine to last you'd better find out what
the problem is an get it fixed.

In the last week or so there have been dozens of post on the
cooling circiut topic for 924/944/951/968 machines.

some ideas:  check your temp sender and gauge
		check your themostat in the water pump
	check that heads have all air bled out
	check hoses , pipes, paths for blockage
	check fan sender device and relays and fuses and fans
		for proper opperation

otherwise youll have a burned up $5000 engine that would normally
last 200,000 miles or better.

I was just looking at the February 1994 issue of Panorama and saw a couple of
items of interest that I thought I would ask about.  First, no page 34 is an ad
for "Up-Fixin der Porsche".  They PCA is offering all nine volumes plus an index
for $116.  What kind of material is in Up-Fixin?  Is it useful for the
air-cooled crowd only, or would I as a 944 owner also find it worthwhile?
Finally, is it worth the cost?

Next, on page 66 is an ad for the Eclipse, which purports to be "an effective
passive radar scrambler".  Apparently, it receives the radar signal, scrambles
it, and re-radiates the scrambled signal.  The ad claims that because it is a
passive re-radiator, it is FCC legal.  Does anyone know anything about this?  I
suppose the bottom line is ... does it work?

    We had some traffic on this a year or more back.  There is a check
valve in the lines to the squirters.  It acts to keep the fluid from

The fuel system in your car operates at about 70 psi.  You may need
the fuel pump running to find a leak, though if it smells as bad 
as you say, it shouldn't be too hard.

The simplest way to run the fuel pump is to remove the air filter and 
(with the ignition on) lift the lifting plate in the F.I.

You will hear the fuel pump start.

Philes;

     Whilst mounting the race wheels the other day, I miced the
brake rotors and found the fronts to be worn under the machining
limits, and the rears to be at the limit.  It's an '83 SC with
118k - I suspect the rotors are original.

     Since I am going to be replacing the rotors, what is the
wisdom on the cross-drilled ones.  They seem to be the latest hot
thing.  I can get the standard rotors for about $200/set (4), or
cross drilled ones from AJR for a little under $400. If I am
replacing them anyway, it's a good opportunity to upgrade.

     I recall something on the net a while back recommending
caution when using aftermarket drilled rotors, but I don't
remember the details.  The car is a daily driver with occasional
autocrosses.  Anyone have experience, good or bad, with drilled
rotors?

Marc,
This sounds like a leaky fuel line that runs in the channel 
between the seats.  Remove the carpet covering this center 
section, also the cover with the four screws on the rear 
center hump in front of the rear seats.  Look for a 
transition from metal tubing to a neoprine with some clamps.

I have experienced this same effect.  I avoid shifting from 1st to 2nd and also
from 3rd to 2nd until the transmission has warmed up.  Recently I replaced the
old gear oil (original from 88) in my transmission with Swepco 201 gear oil.
After the change, shifting was distinctly smoother.  But shifting into 2nd still
requires more force as compared to shifting into the other gears so I still let
it warm up before using 2nd much.

Who among us hasn't imagined driving their favorite P-car with about 50%
more power?  Well I had a chance to compare a '92 968 (cpe with 6-spd)
to my '89 944 (cpe with 5-spd) this past weekend.  In short - what a blast!!  
It was like 911 vroom with 944 handling.

By the way, if anyone else is interested (my spare change just went to the
IRS), the car is at Don McGill in Houston.  They are asking 28.9 (NADA 32.0, 
ave trade 27.9).  It is maritime blue (sort of French racing blue or, if 
you're familiar with the oil patch, Schlumberger blue) with a light 
interior (I don't remember if it was white or a very light gray) and 
40k miles.  It has all records, appropriate maintenance and P700's in good 
condition.  Could be a good deal-Don McGill can usually be negotiated on 
used cars.

Well, it seems I stand corrected.  Either my friend said SCAT when he meant
SCS or I heard SCAT.  No matter -- I called him again this past weekend and
it was, in fact, SCS that sold the furnace brazed fans...

On a slightly different subject, but related through the "Down with SCAT!"
story, there is an issue that I have been curious about for some time.
I am merely asking the net if they have ever heard of the following, and
if so it might be another data point for Stan (although probably not the
one he might be looking for...).

This comes right out of the Gene Berg catalog:
     "Please be clear that following the exclusive Berg instruction is
     mandatory.  No new aftermarket camshaft is heat treated and depends
     on being work hardened by the lifter in the first 5 minutes of
     running."

I realize that Gene Berg deals with VW air cooled engines.  But, the
engine in Stan's story is a Type IV engine, and he buys parts for it
from VW hot rod suppliers.  So, this really does have relevance to the
914 crowd.

All I am asking is, has anyone heard of such "work-hardenable" camshafts,
or are they unique to Gene Berg, since he makes his from virgin, unground
billets?  He does say "No new aftermarket camshaft..."  And if they exist, 
maybe that's what Stan got?

The "trashy rattle" sounds like chain tensioners.  Have the tenioners been
updated to the oil-fed carrera type?  If not, they probably are soft,
particularly with the high mileage on the car.  The "warble" could be the oil
pump.  Older 911s with high miles have noisy oil pumps when cold and the noise
usually goes away when the car warms up.  I'd have the chain tensioners and oil
pump checked.  Oher possible problem areas:  mechanical injection pump (if the
car still has MFI), warm cam chain rails and/or sprockets, clutch.  The 2.4 911
engines are noisy by nature, but anything that doesn't sound right should be
checked.  If the chain tensioner fails on you, you'll be looking at bigger bucks
to replace bent valves, etc.

Subject: not rattlin' heater-boxes after all

In my earlier posting, I diagnosed the noise my 911-engined Vanagon was making
as heater-boxes rattling against exhaust pipes.  Rory Gallagher, at Sportwagen
in Hackensack, while willing to do all the welding I might want, suggested the
noise might actually be the "natural" exhaust noise of the current exhaust sys-
tem.  He was proved right this weekend.

The only exhaust system I can find that fits is a Sebring system from Perfor-
mance Products, which has unequal length pipes from the two heat exchangers,
coming together at a collector and then a short pipe into a light turbo muf-
fler.  I've replaced the muffler with something more substantial, but right
around 2500 rpm I still have the exhaust blat that sounds like a 4-stroke motor-
cycle or poorly muffled MG.  The rest of the rpm range sounds pretty mellow.

I can only mount the stock 911 exhaust briefly for testing, as the only way it
fits is upside down, with about 3 inches of ground clearance, but with the
stock muffler the problem goes away.

Now my questions:  Do we know what characteristic of the exhaust system causes
blat, or determines where in the rpm range it falls?  What does the stock
"sausage" muffler look like inside?  What traits to I have to retain in spec-
ing a custom system, to be sure I get one without blat?  Is it perhaps just the
unequal length pipes that are causing the problem?

Thanks for any guidance.

Hello,

In the Performance Products catalog (No. 33) they have some flush center caps
for the C2/4 Carrerra rims with a large inlaid crest.  The Porsche crest on the
caps is larger then the factory OEM center cap crest for this type of rim.  
The crest is 2 1/4 inches, and is inlaid into the cap.   They want $62.95 for 
one of these caps.  

Is there somehwere else I can order these same caps from, for less money?  This 
price seems very high, and I spoke to someone in purchasing at another parts
supplier on the phone, and they said that performance products gets its caps
from the same supplier this placed used.  He would check if he could get them
too.  Who is this secret supplier?

I would like to use these caps with the larger crest, but don't want to spend
$245 on caps.  Does anyone know the name of the supplier of these caps, and
how I can order from them?  Does anyone have caps they would like to sell?
They need to fit the C@ Turbo style rim, and need to be Metallic Silver.
Thanks.

A few months back, Sports Rider magazine did a real race track comparison 
between a racer-driven Acura NSX and a racer-riden CBR900RR. I don't remember 
the track or the names of the people but I do remember the result.
 
The object of the comparison was to find out who would win the contest between 
two readily available street bike and car expertly driven on a race track.

The CBR900RR kicked butt by a very healthy margin. It is slower by a very small 
margin in the turns against the NSX, but with its overwhelmingly advantageous 
power to weight ratio, it more than makes up for it in the straights. 

Now, some of us may say something about the NSX not being a Porsche 911 Turbo 
but I believe that the NSX, properly driven, is brobably the best handling 
sports car in its class. 

So, slam if you will. Just remember that it is the driver or the rider that 
makes the most contribution to the "lap time."  OH, by the way, remember to 
Share to road with our 2 wheel enthusiasts. Some of them even own Porsches as 
alternate methods of transportation.

Subject: RE:914 ignition systems

Kyle,

To get a bigger kernal I highly recommend Orville Redonbocker's butter
flavored....oops, sorry, wrong kernal.

I have had some experience with aftermarket ignition systems in my 914.
I bought an IGNITOR by Per-Lux to replace the points/condenser.
It's a small magnetic pick-up that fits completely inside the distributor.
Only two wires come out and they connect directly to the coil.
You can find it for sale in the VW magazines. I think the company changed
names, but it's still called an IGNITOR.  I installed this first and I 
like not ever having to fool with the points (or timing) again.

In addition to the IGNITOR I am using a MSD-6AL unit with rev limiter.
The only real noticeable difference is that it idles smoother and doesn't
fowl the plugs. (If you don't use carbs this may not be a problem for you)
For auto-xing it is a very good idea to have a rev-limiter, so that was one
of my motivations for getting the unit. The rev-limit is adjustible and
operates more smoothly than  the stock rev-limiting rotor that you can
get for the 914.

After about a 2 years I started having trouble with the MSD box, so I sent 
it back for repairs.($50) I think it probably was getting too hot in the
trunk
because of no airflow. When I put it back in I plan on installing a small fan
to help cool it.  The great part about it is that if you have trouble, you
just 
disconnect the wires from the distributor and your back in business.

In summary, I think the biggest gain was just replacing the points with
the Ignitor. I think the Allison system does the same thing, but I am not 
sure if it will be compatible with the MSD if you decide to add that too.

Well, if the impellers were worn down to nothing this would be true.  
But I've *never* heard or seen this, and I really, really doubt it 
could happen without other serious & obvious problems!  Air in the 
system is pretty common, and easy to fix.

This works, but the feeling in the hose varies by water pressure and 
how you squeeze it (function of how hot the thing is!).  I find this 
technique works when the engine/water is cooler, rather than full-hot, 
and even then it's not definitive.  Also watch the tank level when you 
do this - it may fluctuate.

> 2) When you bleed the system by opening the bleeding valve how long

Total open time when hot is ~10 minutes, but depends on how well bled 
the system is before you start.  Once the last "burps" are out, I give 
it another 1-2 minutes and I watch it constantly, revving gently up & down.

Subject: Looking for advice

I have a problem that I would appreciate some advice on.
Warning - this will probably be fairly long.

Last summer I bought an '87 951 that I truely love.
Now I have two problems.  First, I've decided that in the
fall of 1995 I'm going to return to school to get
my PhD (hopefully:).  That will leave me with 9 or 10
months worth of payments.  Second, I've become very
interested in autocrossing, driving events, and eventually
club racing.

In both cases my problem is money.  I've already determined
that I won't be able to keep my car when I return to school.
I also don't feel that I can afford the extra costs, at this
point, of taking it to the track.  I'm assuming that I'll 
have to pay significantly more to track it than to just use
it as a street car.  Is this true?  I know at the least I'll
need to purchase a helmet and I'll have to put new tires
on - what else am I looking at?

I'm thinking that my best option is to go ahead and sell my car
now and look for another sports car (preferably a Porsche) that
I'll be able to keep through school.  A 914 or a 924 comes to mind.
Would these be considerably cheaper to track?  Since both of these
have a lot less go-fast parts I'm assuming they would be considerably
cheaper to maintain.  I'm also assuming they would be less reliable - 
due to age if nothing else.  The other advantage is I don't think
I'll be as intimidated about working on them, since any mistakes
I'll make won't be as costly to fix.  

Any opinions, suggestions, offers:), or other advice would be appreciated.
I'm leaning towards looking for a 914 now, but I haven't decided yet.
It will let me become more comfortable with those little aircooled
engines, so I'll be prepared to get my 911 after school.
I don't want to put my car up for sale until I've determined what I'm
going to look for afterwards.

Anyone have suggestions for schools/advisors?  I want to do something in 
DSP/Information Theary/Digital Comm.  

Thanks for any advice in advance.

Subject: Fuel fumes in a '911



   I have a '78 911 Targa, and I've begun to notice a strong fuel smell in 
   the car, particularly after it's been sitting for a while.  The worst 
   was about two weeks ago when I took the top off and drove it.  Instead 
   of warm spring air, it smelled like a refinery.

   I have an almost identical situation and haven't figured it out yet.
   I have an 83 SC coupe and the smell is worse when the sunroof is open. 
   I pulled up the carpet under the hood and didn't smell anything, but I
   haven't looked into it too diligently yet.

Take this problem seriously.  Remember when the sunroof/top is
open/off, the pressure difference between the cockpit and the air
swooping over your head causes a flow of air up and out of the
cockpit.  This has the effect of sucking air through all the little
openings in the floor, the gauges, etc.  More than likely the smell is
coming from the area behind the gas tank, that is accessed by removing
the kickplate, though the gas fumes recirculation system as mentioned
is also a good candidate.

Interestingly enough a trend has developed in our area towards slotted
rotors from cross drilled on 930 brake setups, such as on my SC3.4.

The thought is that 
	a) 930 rotors aren't what they used to be
	 (this has been confirmed somewhat by the inability to "peen" the 
	drill holes to cause residual compression ath the rim, reducing cracking
	b) Slotted rotors won't crack as easily

People have been going to the VCI nascar rotor setup.

Subject: autothority MFS for 951

got the "brochure" yesterday, includes a tourque plot for the 86 and S models and claims or 310 and 320 HP respectively. The "brochure" is a bad copy of a poorly prepared document. If these guys are engineers, this makes them look pre-computer age. 
Anyway, their argument, is that the flapper valve, not only adds air resistance (previosly discussed here, and belittled), but its response time is necessarily too slow to prevent oscillations. That is, the flapper is heavily damped so the computer 
won't overreact. Sounds interesting. The guy i talked with about the dyno said that the HP (on a normally aspirated engine) was the same, but they measured at constant, throttle.

Thoughts? anybody know if the HP numbers are real, and whether they were achieved by sound engineering, or just cranking the boost?

They pointed out that all the current porsches use mass flow sensors...

Subject: 944 Engine Cutting Out


I am trying to troubleshoot a problem with the engine of my 944/2 and I 
would like some advice and recommendations from Porschephiles.

The problem is that the engine cuts out above 3500 RPM at full throttle.

If I apply full throttle below 3500 RPM there is no problem. As soon as the 
engine reaches 3500 RPM under full throttle, it cuts out. If the throttle is 
only partially open as the engine reaches 3500 RPM there is no problem. If 
the engine is already over 3500 RPM with the throttle partially open and I 
apply full throttle, the engine cuts out.

When the engine cuts out it behaves as if there is no fuel and no spark. The 
engine goes from full power to no power instantly and the engine speed 
begins to drop.

If I keep the throttle fully open after the engine cuts out, the engine 
continues to slow down as if there were not fuel or spark. As soon as I back 
off the throttle just a little bit, the engine springs back to life 
immediately as if the problem never happened.

The car is stock except for the one year old K&N air filter.

At first I thought the throttle position switch (TPS) may be the source of 
the problem. The TPS contains two switches that are normally open. One of 
the switches closes when the throttle is fully closed while the other switch 
closes when the throttle is fully open. The TPS performs no other functions. 
After removing, inspecting and testing the TPS with a meter I am absolutely 
sure that the TPS is operating normally. In fact, if I unplug the TPS from 
the wiring harness (leaving both switch circuits effectively open) the 
engine does not cut out. (It just idles a bit too low or a bit too high.)

I can conclude that the TPS is working normally, but when the full throttle 
signal is sent to the computer, the computer decides to shut off the engine 
if its speed is higher than 3500 RPM. One of the other sensors must be 
faulty (or has a faulty connection) or the  computer itself may be having 
problems.

What should I check next? How do I check it?

I suspect that the wires or connector for my oxygen sensor may be bad. Is 
there a way to test the oxygen sensor?

Thanks,

The story as I hear it is this: the holes are good, but the cross-drilling
process is evil. Seems the drilling process disrupts the crystaline 
structure of the metal *AND* can locally anneal the disk, too, causing
the much-discussed "cross drilled disk failure".

The *GOOD* rotors have holes cast into the metal, which provided the
ventilation, and other benefits, but keeps the metal structure intact.

Best bet is to have "fire slots" cut into othewise "flat" rotors and
ignore the cross drilling...

This is not a "newsgroup", this is an e-mail discussion list. The

An Internet address is an Internet address. All discussion lists (or

subscribes to it, so yes porschephiles and autox will still be available 
to you through an AOL account. 

"Newsgroups" are usually associated with Usenet Newsgroups, which AOL just

What Tad humbly omits is that he's won overall in the 914 class a couple

miles on the original engine, and no sway bars. Who says the driver

Here's the deal: the procedure for breaking in a flat-four air-cooled
engine is supposed to involve bringing the engine up to 3500 RPM for about
half an hour to "season" (i.e. work-harden) the camshaft and lifters.
For a racing engine, in particular for say an EP 914, that's over 5% of the
operating life of the engine. Yeah. Right. I can *USE* that 5% somewhere
else....

As a result, some camshafts *ARE* heat-treated.

You're right that the car will cost $$ to play with.  951 operating 
costs might be $1000/year for 5-8 track days if you drive easily and 
save your tires & brakes.  If anything breaks, you'll pay heavily!

I've found that among tires, brakes, general maintenance, gasoline, 
entry fees, motels, road food, etc., that each track day is about 
US$250 with my '86 951, assuming 1 set of tires is good for those 5-8 days.

The 914 will have higher maintenance costs I *think*.  Older 924's may 
also be a bucket of opportunity.  New 924S's (w/944 engine) will be 
pretty good, but they're around $5K-$10K, and your '87 951 will likely 
only fetch $12K or so.  Thus the $$ gap is fairly small, and you 
wouldn't really save that much in new/low upkeep vs. old/high upkeep.

If I were in your shoes I'd probably dump the 951 and say goodbye to it 
all, or postpone school to Autumn 1996 and save like crazy!

Nathan: 

I just got MY87 951 back from the shop yesterday for a new water pump <$sigh>. 
Anyway, I found out to my dismay that the bozo I bought the car from installed 
KYB shocks in the rear with unknown yellow "things" in the front.  Konis? 

What brand shocks are yours? Mileage? Will they fit?  

Netters:
Since I plan to track/autocross the car heavily this year, should I get rid of 
the KYBs?

Well, the outcome depends not only on the drivers and equipment, but 
the setting.  A tight, twisty course will favor the car somewhat; a 
wide-open track will bias towards the bike.

The basis of this is that usually, cars out-corner bikes.  Sure, you 
can change the result with a poor cornering car and a great cornering 
bike, but on the overall, I think this idea is accurate.

In any event, cars & bikes are fun!  So who cares about lapping 
differences except for an academic study?  Turbine cars & missles are 
faster too, to make a silly point!

Subject: Harness in 911


	I have Deist 4 point harnesses in my '72T Targa.  I mounted the lap
belts thru the floor, with a 1/8" steel plate running betwixt the mount
bolts on the bottom, and the washers from hell on top of that.  For the 
rear mount, I drilled a hole thru the back of the (where the engine 
compartment is) and mounted the Y strap to that, along with another 1/8" 
steel play about 6" on a side, and another washer from hell.  
	
	The logic behind the plates is that if I ever did actually _need_ the
belts, it would keep the force from ripping them through the firewall.

	You want to make sure that the angle of the tail strap relative to 
your body is somewhere that is horizontal (straight back) or pretty 
close, because if you mount it to the floor (which I have seen), if you 
do actually need the belts, you are now looking at serious compression 
injuries! I hereby aknowledge in advance that I may be wrong on the exact 
angle here, but the important things is for it not the be straight down...

	If you averse to actually drilling holes in your baby, then I don't 
know what to say.

Well, in another month or so it will be as hot as hell here in Phoenix. So I

Has any one experimented with one of those fine mist heads? I have spoken to a

What about misting water on to the front fender oil cooler or even misting into

On the pre-86 cars I am told it nearly impossible to get sufficient cooling

   harnesses can be mounted..  Any ideas?

The older 911s, and I'm not sure when this stopped so I don't know if
the 71 still has it, had a mounting point for harnesses under the rear
window.  It's welded in and threaded, just waiting for your harness.
You have to remove that piece of vinyl that's under the rear window to
get to it.

Actually, as my memory starts to unfade, I'm thinking this was only
available on the E and S, but I suppose it couldn't hurt to check.
Beats the hell out of drilling.

Subject: 914 Price Survey - RESULTS!

Hello!

First, let me thank everyone replied with information or requests for the
results.  I received about 20 messages on this subject including several
*let me know what you find out* requests.  I'm glad to see some interest
on the net concerning the subject!

I'm going to attempt to summarize the results here through the use of general
headings and comments.  If you want more info, contact me directly and I'll
be glad to provide some more details.


'73-'76 2.0L CARS
- ------------------

These are very popular models with 914 enthusiasts for several reasons (see
archives).  As might be expected, the price varies wildly with condition (and
location and season, as Kyle pointed out!)  Here's what I found:

High:  $6,500 for a Club Racing prepared '75
Low:  $730 (after rebate!) for Kyle's *Saga of '76* project

Average:  $3,450 for a good solid, *needs very little* car

Note:  The average for a *needs some work*-type cars (for instance:  needs
some combination of clutch, paint, small parts, minor repairs) was $2,275.
These were non-rusted-out cars that were somewhat less than perfect but were
not hopeless.  Just in need of a more TLC!

OTHER MODELS
- ------------

There was very little non-2.0L response.  Here's the summary:

High: $1,800 for Tad's Black *Giant Killer*
Low:  $50 for a stock, non-running, *quite rusted* '70

I had one data point from New Zealand that I didn't include in any averages
but found interesting:  $US4,500 for a non-running '71 that was in otherwise
*real good condition.*

There was one response concerning the 914-6 model.  It clocked in at $12,750
for what sounds like a VERY nice little car...  Wanna trade for my rusty '74
1.8L and a nice Chevy Blazer?  :^)

PARTS CARS
- ----------

The prices for cars that were reported as *for parts* ranged from $0.00 to $400.

SUMMARY
- -------

The average for the 2.0L cars was about what I expected - probably somewhat 
more realistic than the prices you see in Pano or Excellence!  I did receive an
interesting summary of advertised prices in the LA area.  They seemed to be,
on average, lower than other reported prices.  This may have been due to  
below average condition or a relative *glut* of 914s.  I didn't include this
data because I was looking for ACTUAL prices but it did provoke the idea that 
a serious buyer might want to look around CA for a car if he or she had the
chance.

Thanks again for the responses and interest!  I hope the net found it a useful
and interesting exercise!  I did!

I've found that most English speakers know very little about
English, let alone any other language.  ;-)   How do you
pronounce "Renault" (rhymes with "fault" or "know")?

I heard an interview once where Herr Doktor Porsche was asked
whether "Porsche" is a one or two syllable word.  He replied that
it doesn't matter.  But, he always used the two syllable form...
He should know, it's his name.

 It sounds rather as if Mr.Pellow is getting a case of cold feet.  The rules
seem pretty straightforward to me; the only thing I might add is that the
cars must be driven to and *from* the site under their own power or be
disqualified.  This would eliminate trailering in a 'special' or engine
failures during the timed runs.

 I have driven on the "driveway" in question at speed and, while less than
Interstate quality, it is more than suited to the task at hand.  After all,
you're only talking about 120mph...

Dear Peter:



      Some comments on your last missile:



>OK, now we're getting somewhere, albeit slowly.



    Speak for yourself. Personally, I think the

Entertainment value for Porschephiles is now higher than the

Letterman show when Madonna was on. That's a compliment,...

I think.



>This all started when Pellow claimed that his street stock

     Not really. This all started when you, Mr. Albrecht,

jumped on me for  telling that poor guy NOT to try to remove

the fan nut from his  generator/broken fan by holding the

pulley hub in a vice and breaker-baring  off the nut. Can

you say "sheared-off key", or "ruined pulley hub" or

"ruined generator shaft"?  When I said that exploding fans

were fairly rare  as the Maestro's Broken Parts Collection

only has three examples, you said  that must be 'cause my

engines don't go over 4000 RPM. 



Now, really. That wasn't very nice. It also wasn't very True. 



     I have a nice letter from a Satisfied Customer who told

about entering the Massachusetts Turnpike one sunny Sunday,

right next to an early 911. After they got their tickets, they

accelerated together out onto the Turnpike.  And kept

accelerating.  And the 356 kept jusssstt a little ahead of

the 911. And they kept accelerating. And the 356 very

sloooowwwly increased its lead. And when finally that's all

there was, there weren't no more, the guy in the 356 looked

down at the instruments which read 6,000 RPM and 120 MPH.



>The driveway is about 4 miles long for our purposes, about

>2 lanes wide  (1 each way), loose gravel on surface and

>bumpy in spots. There is a dry  lake bed on either side, so

>if you go off you will have the world's longest  accident. 



  Ah, yes, do we really want to waste Precious Natural

Resource zooming down  some woman's driveway with "loose

gravel on surface and bumpy in spots". What a great place

for a High-Speed run in a 30+ year old car. Once again the

Maestro flashes on the hero from "Back to the Future",  who

in one time continuum when called Chicken for not drag

racing, instead decides to race and is killed. Stupidity

killed him then, and the Maestro doth believe that Stupidity

Kills, for he's seen many engines  killed, nay, MURDERED by

Stupidity.

 

>No teardowns. I don't have the time. You want to play, fine.

>If not, go away.



    No teardowns? No way to ensure honesty, eh? You want me

to play the game according to your rules, (with no means for

inspection), and your instruments, or go away. I think  that 

Porschephiles oughta vote on the rules- and maybe on who should 

"go away" too.



>No engine claiming. My case is the one that left the factory

>in this car, I intend to keep it, and I don't want one of

>yours.



     Oh, too bad. I was hoping to buy yours to tear down just

to see ifin there be a Story there. Provided, of course, that 

you really did build your engine yourself.



>I'm ready right now. Let's do it on Friday, April 8. Meet

>you in Barstow, say, 9 AM at the Barstow Station

>MacDonald's on Main Street.



   Sorry, but I'll be doing my Income Tax that weekend, like

many millions of patriotic Americans. And, besides, as you

say, "I don't have the time".



    How about we answer people's questions about Porsche

Problems instead? That's what I intend to do.



    And wasn't/isn't that the purpose of Porschephiles anyhow? 



                  KEEPING THE 356 FAITH!!!



    The Maestro

From: prado@snowtires.Corp.Sun.COM (Pete Rado)
Subject: Racing Harness

I have an 87 911 that I keep as stock as possible but modify for track events
and then return stock appearance.

I purchased a bar that mounts to the B pillars in place of the shoulder
belt D rings and extends across the car just behind the driver/passenger
shoulders.  I bought it mail order from a company that advertises in Panorama.
Its about $100.

The Shoulder harness itself, I bought the "long" 3" wide version with the H
strap and hole mounts (instead of clip mounts) and bolt them into the rear
seatbelt mounting holes instead of the rear seatbelts.  I use different hardware
than the bolts that hold the stock rear belts and keep it captive to the  shoulder
harness for ease of installation.  The shoulder harness then lays over
the bar and over the top of the seat with the H strap in front of the headrest, but 
behind my neck when I sit.  

This gives an easlly removable shoulder harness that does not require drilling
or altering of the interior without concern for spinal compression in the case of
an accident.

I also made up an aluminum bracket that my fire extinguisher is mounted to
that straddles the rear hump and has holes that line up with the seatbelt mounts
on either side of the hump.  So besides using the rear seatbelt mounts for my
shoulder harness, it also holds my fire extinguisher in place, and again is
easilly removable.

Hope this helps

Does anyone know if the rear seat 2-point harness attaching holes on a 911 
can be used (newer cars). This is some 40 cm below the point straight back
from the shoulders. What is the recommended angle?

I need some good opinions here.  I am still in school (about 1 year to 
go) and am considering buying a 911 sometime after graduation.  I am 
willing to put out about $40,000 - $45,000 on one (remember, this will be
in about a year).  The cars under consideration are a 911 Carerra 2, 911 
Carerra 4, and 911 Turbo.  This car will be an every day car and I'm still 
not sure if I'll have a backup econo car or not.  I prefer the performance
and looks of the Turbo, however, I am concerned about the maintenance and
reliability.  What would you consider, and why?

I do not think that you can rule out a bad computer or connector yet but I 
sounds just like a problem I experienced. Cause---bad TPS.  I would:

1. Check and clean all electrical connections to the TPS and computer.
2. Check all vacuum lines.
3. Check all vacuum lines again.
4. Disconnect TPS again and see if the car runs.
(Unless you know the FI system very well you have run out of things to do.)
5. Let a good  shop check the TPS, O2 sensor and DME.

Subject:  911 Harness

    I mounted a 5-point harness in my 911 by using the existing lap
    belt bolts on the seat (removed the OEM lap and shoulder belt).  I
    then mounted the shoulder belts into the lap belt holes in the
    rear seat (I had to remove the rear belts)- this, I believe,
    requires an "H" type shoulder belt and not the "Y" type (besides,
    some sanctioning bodies don't like the "Y" type).  And to
    support Thom's comments, I then installed a bar between the B
    pillars to run the shoulder straps across to prevent compression
    injuries.

    Before mounting any harness, I would suggest reading
    the relevant rules of the organization you'll be running with.  I
    am pretty sure that my lap belt setup would not pass for PCA club
    racing- it can't be mounted to the seat
    (i.e., drill through and bolt to the floor board).

How's the overall condition?  The miles are very low, so if the car's 
in really, really good condition this might be only a slightly high 
starting price.  Around Boston, this car will go for $10K - $12K.  Two 
years ago, a friend sold his '86 951 for $12.5K, and it had some 
performance mods with average miles and condition.

Note that low mileage is a negative too; cars stored for the winter or 
driven on short trips have dry seal problems and bearings that didn't 
get regularly oil coated.  45K doesn't alarm me in this category, but 
it is a little low.

The A/C is standard, sunroof and alarm are extra.  The factory alarm is 
useless; I wouldn't want it at all!  A friend had a stereo stolen from 
his 944 w/factory alarm enabled.  There's no motion sense, remote 
unlock, door lock integration, etc. etc. that all modern alarms have.

Subject: re: '78 targa fuel leak


hello everyone,

a few days ago Soren posted a note about the *subject.*  He stated that you
could get the fuel pump to run by lifting the *air lever* in the CIS system.
Soren and I had a chat about doing this.  It's true - the pump will run. 
However, this causes fuel to be INJECTED behind the intake valves - the FI
system *thinks* the motor is running.

You MIGHT be able to do this if you just lift a *little* but it would be 
worth checking by pulling a few injectors a seeing if they are squirting!

Running the fuel pump this way for more than a few moments could result in
a badly flooded or *hydo-locked* motor.  Neither are good things!

You could jumper the relay (see a wiring diagram) *OR* unhook the connector
toward the rear of the FI assembly to get the pump to run while leaving the
*air lever* down.  I'd still check for leaking injectors...  Be careful with
the connector if you go that way - it's hard to see and easy to break.

Hope everyone finds their fuel leaks!  I hope I don't have any when *Elisabeth*
comes out of winter storage!

  Subject: 914 ignition switch (the TRUTH about 914 starter problems).

  Distribution Status: Free to redistribute, share or publish in any form.
  
  cast-offs from kyle ehler:

  Well its always something..  
  I went to drive the Saga to work today and the starter would'nt go.
  Later, i combed thru it.  Here's another pocket analyis of a pesky
situation many if not all 914's have.  Intermittent starters.
  Whether hot, cold, wet, or ?? a starter not working, and a fix for it
that i now believe to be a HOAX.  Please read on

  I removed the steering console to access the ignition switch.
  I've been here before.. and always chickened out opening the switch to
see what's inside.  I figured out how to open these up without destroying
them -warm the nylon body and use a sharp tipped tweezers to gently 
perturb the housing enough to open and release both sides of the catch.
  These are two-level.  The first (lowest) has the terminals and supports
for the contacts.  The upper section has the return spring and contact
sequencer.  Both German and Mexican switches are well built of solid brass
terminals and contacts.  The main starter contact seems to be silver plated.

  In my analysis of 5 switches, *all* had burnt starter contacts.
  *ALL* other contacts were used, but in great condition -these wear very
little.  In most cases, the housings were stained with grease or oil, it
looked like the lock tumbler leaches lubricant down into the switch body
and contaminates the innards of the switch.  This really buggers the starter
contacts.  The only other failure mode observed was that caused by a heat-
warped housing that allowed a contact to drift from its mate and fail to 
make connection. In this case, the ignition voltage source and the reason
the car's flywheel gear was eaten.

 Now for the best part..
  
  A starter has a rather large solenoid to engage the bendix.
  That solenoid is a coil of wire similar to an ignition coil both in 
construction and behavior.  That solenoid coil is zapping the fritz out
of the starter contact inside the ignition switch each time you disengage
the starter.  The Porsche designers did not include a spike suppresion 
diode across this solenoid coil, so the impulses slowly eat away at the
contacts.  This in turn increases the contact resistance, thereby reducing
the available current to energize the starter solenoid.  It takes a period
of years, but it is inevitable.

***  The starter is at the heart of the problem,                      ***
*** but it is not the failing element in a grinchy starting situation.***

  The folks who sell parts, will gladly sell you a 'bootstrap' relay that
will eliminate the problem -for a while until the contacts in that relay
fry also (if no suppressor diode is part of the new relay).  Many relays
now have integral to their construction, a diode to shunt the always present
de-energizing impulse that is inherent in any electro-mechanical relay.
914's dont have suppressed relays.

  Having said this, I now offer a theoretical fix.
 ** I havent done this yet **
  -take a 1N4004 diode and place it across the solenoid, attach the cathode
end (end with line) to the solenoid terminal, and bond the other end to 
chassis or ground.  This works on other relays and should work on this 
application.  I wont gaurantee anything, but this should greatly increase
the life of a 91X ignition switch.  It was raining outside the day i did 
this, so i did not use my O-scope to measure the impulse -but i bet 
they are in the kilovolt range.

  I hope this was worth the bandwidth!

Subject: Spraying oil under car to prevent rust..


Hello,

Cheap rust-proffing solution?  Good or bad?

Has anyone ever heard of or done this:  Put used engine oil into a plant
sprayer container (ones used to spray trees) and put thier Porsche on lift and
sprayed down the underside of thier car with a cost of this oil?  

This is something I heard is done to Porsche's (or other cars) to prevent
rust in climates where there is snow/salt and water deterioration to the
metal under side of the cars.  I have heard this is done in New hampshire
at some garages for about $15.  I assume they  make sure to keep the oil off
of and out of the brake areas, and away from the enginer and muffler.

The theory behind it, I was told, was that the oil seeps into all the small
cracks, pits, and knooks and crannys of the fenders, and underside of the
car and displaces the water in these areas.  It remains there and when water
tries to get into these rust prone areas, the oil reples it.  It is just 
used engine oil.  This process of spraying the underside is repeated every 6
months or so, or once in the fall, and once again in the spring.

Has anyone done this to thier cars?  Is it worthwhile to prevent rust?  I do
not drive my 81 Targa in the winter, but do sometimes in the spring/summer/fall
when the raods are wet or raining.  This oil would keep the water out of
places where the galvanized body parts have lost some of thier galvanization.
It might make things greasy to work with if you have to do any work to the
underside of the car though.

Subject: Ross Stites: Looking for advice

If I were you, I would not look at an older car. The chances are too great 
that it will not be a cheap way to track a Porsche, but just an expensive 
way to fix up someone else's problem. While 914-6's are the fastest things 
on the track, they are not the cheapest. An '87-'88 924S' seem like a 
reasonable option. They are available for the $5000 range around NYC. An 
older 914 or 924 might go for half the price, but would have twice the 
mileage and not be as quick around the track. To put either car into track 
readiness would cost about the same. Racing seats, roll cages, fire control 

systems, cut-off switches, 15" shaved tires and the like cost the same no 
matter what you put them on. Look for a car that a track junkie is selling 
because they are upgrading. The necessary toys will be there, and the price 

will be lower because potential buyers will be scared off by the track 
hours and the extraneous equipment.

Does it have to be a Porsche? Having a chipped '86 951 myself, I know why 
you love yours. However, in my young, poor but happy days (try financing 
racing when your job is delivering pizzas) I owned a CRX and several 
RX-7's. The CRX was fun, but had a hard time hitting 100mph, and didn't 
have much aftermarket support. Mazda Motorsport on the other hand, sold 
parts (stock and racing) to racers (at least 3 races per season) for below 
jobber cost. My street driven, but far from stock '79 RX-7 regularly 
exceeded its 120mph speedometer. And rotaries have plenty of character. The 

only problem is that you will have to miss most PCA events. However, there 
is always the SCCA.

Define "not smooth."  Wild hunting, or just a little surging?  Yes,
vacuum leak is a possibility.  Check the injector o-rings and the intake

engine tone changes, and look for water getting sucked in (ie, not

It looks from the schematics that the WOT switch is most likely culpret

On my 86 951 the idle switch in the thottle position sensor went bad
and the damn thing would NOT run up past about 2800rpm without
the injectors cutting out 

Why..because the idle sensor switch was ON all the time
BUT the DME says 'shut off injectors betwee ~4500 and 2800 rpm
when your foot is off the pedal. 

so the car thinks your COASTING when your trying to ACELERATE!!!

Subject: rust prevention

Barry

Without being an expert on the subject I would not recommend to
spray your 911 with used engine oil. First of all is the underside
of you car galvanized and then covered with a rather thick layer
of PVC (or some plastic compund). If you spray oil on that it will 
do no good. If the PVC layer has delaminated from the metal I 
presume that this will get even worse. I'm no fan of the PVC coating 
because i tend to delaminate. When this happen the moisture penetrates 
in to the cavity, but it can't get out (moisture pumping). An other thing 
I've heard about used engine oil is the the contamination (metal) makes 
the oil a not so good rust preventer.

I have an '82 SC and I check the underside of the car every winter.
The PVC coating had delaminated in the left front wheel housing
where the tank filler tube goes to the tank and at the brackets
that holds the panel between the front and rear LH wheels.

I then cut the PVC coating away, brushed the rust away (surface),
treated it with linseed oil and then a special body spray (thin) 
for rust prevention. The (raw) linseed oil is good because it is not 
environmentally harmful and it creeps extremely well, even upwards
on a vertical surface.

I'm confident that this method is much better than to cover everything
in a thick layer of oil and to hope for the best.

If I would have had an older cheap everyday driver I would probably
go for the used oil method. A friend of mine does this on his old Volvo
142. The bad thing is that it drips oil for weeks after the treatment...

Good luck

Harry:
 
So who's writing your material these days? We know you can't write without
accidentally leaving the caps lock stuck on, and your latest posting has only
one "ifin" innit. Did you get the wife to help, or hire a neighborhood high
school kid to edit your stuff?
 
>This all started when you, Mr. Albrecht,
>jumped on me for  telling that poor guy NOT to try to remove

The top speed challenge started when you claimed that your standard customer
engines would peg speedo and tach (120 mph/6000 rpm). I claim they can't, not
on a level road with your standard cam, carbs and low compression.
 
The whole flame war started when you told _ME_ to TIGHTEN (not loosen) my fan
with an impact wrench to keep it from coming loose and again destroying the oil
cooler. That set me off because 1) the use of an impact wrench is questionable
to say the least, and 2) you still didn't get it, the fan was still firmly
attached to the generator, it merely hurled its blades.
 
To refresh your apparently addled memory, your exact words on March 08 were
>Oh, and it's best not to stick the pulley end of the generator in a vice
>[sic] ant [sic] try to torque the fan nut down. All you'll get is a sheared
>off key/keyway. An air impact wrench and knowledge of the torque (not hp)
>produced is nerted [sic???] to tighen them thar nuts down sufficiently but
>let's not overdo it.
 
Note that the "poor guy" you were trying to help out with the fan was ME, not
somebody else whose conversation I jumped into. I was asking whether anybody
knew about high-performance or racing fan applications for the Type I or 356.
I wasn't asking for lessons in hammer mechanics. I have since learned that
Rimco, like all VW and Porsche high performance shops, is familiar with high-
RPM Type I/356 fan failures, has a fix, and I picked up my reinforced fan
earlier today.
 
Later, you changed this story to read _loosening_ the fan nut with an impact
wrench, which is an entirely different matter.
 
Your story about the customer who outran a 911 is quaint, but proves nothing.
First, it was not a controlled experiment. Second, if the 911 driver is
anything like many experienced drivers, he likes to let some fool run
interference for him. There is no way that one of your customer 356s will
outrun even a lowly 2.0 liter 911 (in good health), for which the factory
conservatively claimed a top speed of 210 km/h (130 mph) from 130 DIN hp. The
original 911 had as its performance target the Carrera 2, not the C/SC.

Since when are you so concerned about wasting precious natural resources? If
so, you're in the wrong business. As for the driveway, I was warning you about
what to expect, and that you might want to get a professional driver to go on
this road for you. I have no problem there, my personal record there is 172
mph in a ZR-1 Corvette, hands off the wheel, with a CHP officer in the
passenger seat. The record for my test gear on this road is 186 mph in a tuner
300 ZX, owner driving. Top speed recorded by the gear was 194 at Bonneville,
which agreed with the SCTA's timing lights on that run. My 30+ year old car is
up to it; why not yours? And don't hide in the Sierra Club's skirts.

The instrument accuracy can be verified and demonstrated onsite. The teardown
or claiming rules are your idea. I merely challenged you to bring out your
street engine to run against my street engine. You say you are concerned
about "honesty." But your interpretation of honesty is unusual. You say
you've built these supermotors for 20 years, but now to take on the Driveway
you are building a cheater engine. Yes, I said cheater, because your stock
engines will not do the job and you feel compelled to build a special motor
for just this purpose. Remember that people in the 356 community talk. And the
talk on the street is that you and the independent machinist who does most of
your work are calling all the builders of hot 356s in the country to ask how
it's done. That's how you learned about, and why you brought up, the piston
failures for the Shasta pistons, and blame it on "metallurgy." The failures
occurred under racing conditions, and metallurgy has nothing to do with it,
and you know it. They failed after an estimated 18 hours of racing at 8000
rpm, something your engines will never see. That's why you have ordered
forged pistons of your own. Do as I say, not as I do?  Tell me Harry, what
part of "street engine" don't you understand?
 
The top speed challenge was issued on March 12. On March 23, I wrote "...I
figure you've had 20 years to do it. And my challenge was not for a race
motor. That's why, three months from now, I don't want to see you roll some
motorized hand grenade off a trailer in the high desert. I'm talking about my
everyday driver, grocery-getter and weekend warrior. The same sort of engine
you claim to have built on a regular basis for two decades." You didn't get
it, did you?
 
Several members of this forum have suggested that the contesting engines have
already survived some specified mileage, say 10,000 or 20,000 miles. I can
document, via logbook and fuel receipts, that my engine has done 50K miles
without a teardown. I expected that you would find a customer under similar
circumstances who would be amenable to the challenge.
 
I finally figured out why you introduced these claiming and teardown rules.
This whole thing started as a bet for an oil cooler. Whoever loses is out
bragging rights and an oil cooler, no big deal. But you saw a way to turn it
into a win-win situation, even if my car kicks your sorry turkey-feathered
ass right onto that dry lake bed. You could demand a teardown and find out
what happened, or buy the engine and take it home to do same. Well, Harry,
this time it won't work. But I have an even better proposal. I figure the
core value of my engine is $1000. You want to claim it for $5000. If you
will send me a check for $4000, I will tell you, honestly and completely,
what is in it. I will even consent to have an independent 356 mechanic, one
who has never worked on this engine but is known to the community, perform
the teardown before witnesses. And I can confidently predict that you will
not be able to take that information and build a car that will perform as
well as mine AND stay together as long. Ultimately, the joke will be on you.
My engine has nonstock components in exactly the same locations where your
customer engines employ nonstock components, but it does not have the same
components as you claim to have in your off-the-shelf motors, and that is why
I claim mine runs faster and longer.
 
Tomorrow is Friday. I assume you haven't had time enough to put your cheater
together, and there will be no showdown. I pitched it right over the plate
(2 slaloms, one top speed run) and you didn't even swing at it. You have
three strikes, no balls, and as far as I'm concerned you're outta here.

Subject: Used Oil for Undercoating

Barry wondered about using oil crankcase oil as a substitute undercoating
for protection in our less than friendly New England winter driving
conditions.  Like Ehab, I recommend letting your environmental conscience
be your guide.  We used to spray used oil inside the panels and beneath
VWs in the 'old' days twice a year before I knew better.  I later worked
in Saudi Arabia in the 70's and like Dubai, they sprayed the underside of
vehicles with used oil for protection against seasalt corrosion.  They
also steam-cleaned the underside before the oil application too.  

I had a VW bug that lasted well over 200,000 miles probably because of this
practice.  I reasoned that as the car aged, the undercoating lost is
resilience and therefore cracked.  Oil being hydrophobic and easily
replacable forms a film that while displacing moisture and and providing
a barrier against free oxygen will happily stretch when chassis torsion
requires it to do so, unlike dried up undercoating.  However, the
environmental impacts due to used crankcase oil are well known and
insidious ranging from contaminated groundwater and surface water supplies
to damaged wetlands.  Environmental contamination from petroleum product is
driving a good chunk of our thriving economy.  Instead, recycle your oil.  
Please.  

My pride and joy stays parked from November until May as a preventative
measure.  However, as soon as the roads are clear of snow and salt and
temperatures are above freezing in winter, I'm off to the local car wash,
down on my knees hosing down the underside of my daily driver.  For a
winter that lasts 16 weeks and a cost of $2.50 / visit (once / week),
$40.00 per year beats the hell out of thousands of dollars spent on 'salt
bit' sheet metal and paint repairs.

Up here in Ottawa, the cool thing to do is to have a anti-rust spray applied 
every fall. The fluid used is not oil, but a clear oily chemical mixture 
optimized for preventing rust.

They not only spray under the car, but also *behind* as many body panels as 
possible. On common road cars they drill holes in unseen places to gain 
access. By special request, instead of drilling holes they will remove some 
parts of the interior to gain access to the back of body panels.

This service costs me $100 each fall. If you want some more information,

Doug, is this for your 855T?  We just picked up ours last night, and it

They do that with Kerosine on a yearly basis over in 
Germany. Does it work?  Well, cars rust out over there 
as fast as they do here (or faster) and IMHO all it does
is encourage dirt and grime to build up in hard to get at
places. Clean and dry is better. Generally, rust starts in
places that don't dry out because there is dirt to hold the
water for long periods of time.

That said, my 911 has always done a pretty good job of
keeping the underside oiled, at least from the trans back!
(although *most* of the oil leaks are fixed)

>Someone told me this is normal for 944s...

Nonsense, mine and others I've driven idle just fine.

>What else is there to check/change?

Here are some things that have messed up my idle in the past:

 - dirty throttle body
 - throttle position switch
 - idle screw
 - oxygen sensor
 - right-side motor mount

Dirty throttle body: Remove the rubber manifold the feeds the throttle body 
and look down the throat of the throttle body. It will probably be covered 
with black, oily grit from the crank case breather. Remove and clean the 
entire assembly. There is a narrow idle passage that you should pay 
particular attention to. After cleaning, lubricate the throttle linkage 
using white spray grease. My throttle got sticky when I didn't do this.

Throttle position switch: It is a small black unit on the bottom of the 
throttle body. Unplug the connector from the switch to reveal three
pins. The centre pin is a common lead to two switches inside the unit. When 
the throttle is fully closed, a switch shorts the left pin to the centre 
one. When the throttle is fully open, a switch shorts the right pin to the 
centre one. Verify this with a meter. If the closed-throttle switch is not 
working, the switch may need adjustment. The two screws that mount the 
switch to the throttle body can be loosened to adjust the position of the 
switch. There should be an audible click from the switch when the throttle 
reaches its closed position.

Idle screw: The vertical screw on the left side of the throttle body is the 
idle screw. To adjust it, unplug the throttle position switch and then turn 
the idle screw until the engine is idling at about 900 RPM. This should be 
done with the engine at normal operating temperature.

Oxygen sensor: If the oxygen sensor is not working, the tach needle will 
bounce like a basketball, up and down from 0 to 2000 RPM. I'm not sure how 
to test the oxygen sensor, but if you unplug the wires that lead to it, the 
idle will start to bounce. The connector for these wires is under the hood 
just in front of the centre of the windshield. There are two connectors 
there that look very much alike. The one that has wires leading down to the 
exhaust pipe is for the oxygen sensor. Make sure that the connector is clean 
and well seated.

Right-side motor mount: If the motor mount is shot the motor will vibrate 
excessively at idle. The right side fails because it is so close to the 
exhaust header pipes. If is bad, the rubber boot that encloses it will be 
torn and covered with hydraulic fluid and dirt. Replace it with the *latest 
revision* of the turbo motor mount.

I am a shade-tree mechanic and not a professional, so you may want to have 
my observations verified by someone more experienced.

  The older 911s, and I'm not sure when this stopped so I don't know if
  the 71 still has it, had a mounting point for harnesses under the rear
  window.  It's welded in and threaded, just waiting for your harness.
  You have to remove that piece of vinyl that's under the rear window to
  get to it.
  Actually, as my memory starts to unfade, I'm thinking this was only
  available on the E and S, but I suppose it couldn't hurt to check.
  Beats the hell out of drilling.

That mount point is on all 1966 vintage Porsches.  

Only problem is that it is a *low* mount point.  Studies in the 60s
suggested that the shoulder strap mount should not be below your
shoulder: the strap should not go down to the attachment.

Unless you are short, the existing mount point will not meet
this criterion.

In my novice experience, used engine oil can wreak havoc especially
on certain rubber parts. My '68 Plymouth Valient's slant-six leaks
oil that snakes its way down to the tie-rod ends and eats away
at the thick rubber washers there. I've had to have them replaced
twice. 

Randomly applying used Engine oil to the undersides of cars
seems like a bad idea for car owners, although mechanics who offer
this service might coincidentally find themselves spending less money
to have their used engine oil properly disposed of...

Subject: Oil as a rust preventative...

I havn't done this on purpose but I can offer some anecdotal evidence
from other cars I have owned.  The 72 Land Rover had a frame rusted to
the point where the front spring mounts were no longer attached to the
rest of the frame, the only area with absolutly no rust was under the
engine and trans where the drip of engine and 90w oil covered everything
(absolutly no rust at all).  On the old slug (Saab 96) you could have
rust preforation all over the body but the pan under the engine never
rusted out what with being covered by oil.  The down side is you wind up
with stuff coating the area that resembles loose tar, which makes sense
given one way they cheaply repave roads is to spread sand and then spray
oil.

All that said I would never do this with the 951 which stays indoors in
the winter and besides thats what the zinc galvanizing is for.  If you
car is pre zinc pick your poison.

  Plus, you can dial 'em to 'soft' for the commute to the track and keep your

Thanks,
  Not surprised the stock 3.2 got beat, but did you do any mods, e.g.

Also, yes, I'm aware gearing and shift behavior will have major effect

  You may want to check your saftey rules in your area.  In N. California and

Picking up the belt mount on the inside of the seat would not pass tech

Not smooth means idle wanders between 900-950 RPM, stays at 950 MOST
of the time but dipping to 900 at least once every 2-3 seconds,
but not in any pattern of course.  I'm beginning to suspect injectors.
It always dips, doesnt surge.

Finally got my fuel filter off.  Looks like it's been on for awhile.
It appears someone might have used Locktite on the filter threads.
In the process of removing it, I boogered the fuel line from the
pump to the filter. *sigh*   Think I found a used one.  PCNA says
there's not a new one in the U.S. and they have to order if from
Europe for the dealer.  I've never encountered something so hard
to remove.  This was my fourth attempt.  I couldnt budge it on
the other three!   Anyhow, I'll try the water trick with the injectors
once I get the car back together.

This is NOT a vibration though, it's an ignition type of problem.
I still dont understand the arcing sound in the distributor cap
when the engine "misses".  Only thing not replaced ignition-wise

With regard to what Randy wrote:

The 944S has no idle screw in its throttle body.  Not adjustable.

Unplugging the ox sensor will run the engine management "open loop,"
and you will cure, not cause, hunting in the idle.  As it gets old
and crusty, it will get lazy, that it, it will respond less quickly
to air/fuel changes.  Rather than causing wild hunting at idle, I
believe you'll see overshoot and a little hunting during decell, ie,
foot off the throttle.

(One of the really vexing phenomena of closed loop and adaptive
engine management systems is that they hide problems by compensating
for them.  F'rinstance, there was a 928S4 in the shop not too long
ago which ran really poorly -- once!  Wouldn't repeat.  Turned out
to be a bad engine temp sender, revealled after basically going
through the whole test procedure.  The DME just "fixed" the problem,
which is why it wouldn't repeat!)

The TPS is an absolute bitch to get to on the 944S, basically
inaccessible from above or below without major disassembly.  You
can't even get the connector off the thing.  Rather than trying to
yank it, I would recommend testing it at the DME plug in the passenger
footwell, if indeed that is of interest.

How to test an oxygen sensor is one of the riddles which has puzzled
mankind since ancient times.  I don't know.  But I did recently pick
up an old factory manual which does include a test program: "Oxygen
Sensor System", document 4593.21.  Dunno when it was published, but
because it mentions the SC and 924 Turbo, I'd guess around '80.  I
guess maybe I'll read the thing.

Subject: Re: 944S: Rough Idle

Darren,

I just remembered that there was a tech bulletin specifically for
the 944S.  Seems that some cars developed a miss because of arcing
between the wires and the hood.  There's an insulator sheet which
I think you glue to the hood.  I don't remember whether this was
only for cars produced after they deleted the foam noise deadening
liner from the hood.  (My tech bulletin index has gone temporarily
missing.  I can dig the info out if you're interested.)

Sorry to hear about the fuel line.  We have one on a donor car at
the shop, I believe, which we can let you have.  Nathan Ulrich also
probably has one, and I'll bet George Bueselinck does too.  Both
those guys are on the list (ulrich@canberra.whoi.edu and
georgebeuselinck@csbh.com).

Loctite?  Sheesh.  Tip: when faced with a fitting which is hard to
loosen, in fact in any case, the best thing to do is get the two
counter-holding wrenchs set up on their fasteners so that they form
a mild "V".  You then squeeze them together with your two hands.
This puts as much force as possible on the job with minimal risk of
things going flying or getting boogered, so to speak.

 Greetings.
  On your 914..sounds like a loose ground at the point above the driver's
left knee under the dash.  Sorta back and to the left of the fuse block.
  The stud is horizontal with a terminal and several brown wires.
  Brown wires in a 914 are grounded.
  
  Another possible is a short somewhere in the wire feeding the brake lites,
rear license lites, and transmission reverse switch.  That wire is brown
with a white tracer or maybe grey with a brown tracer and travels thru
the center conduit between the seats.. A hard short will blow fuse #9
(i think) and cause the fuel gauge, tach, and idiot lites to not work and
the parking brake and turn signal indicator to blink at a different rate.
  Sounds like you've added a twist with the dash lites, but maybe i
didnt see that when i was troubleshooting my Saga.

  Something else just popped in my mind:  On the back of the speedo near
the top is an instrument lamp with a fast-on sticking out and nearly 
touching the inside of the dash metal, it has to be oriented or bent over
to avoid touching.  If memory serves, the terminal on that wire should have
sleeving on it to insulate.  check it out..

  There are factory manuals available (about $350) detailing every aspect
of the 914 4 and 6.  They include color wiring diagrams for later models,
(current flow) and standard b&w diagrams for earlier models.

  My info is taken from diagrams for a '75-76 914-4 and may vary from
your specimen.  Hope this was of use.

 Subject:  WHERE'S THE BOOST ??
 Date: 1994-04-08 07:59
 Priority:

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 My 89 951 has been having an intermittent loss of boost and I thought
 someone might have some idea on the cure.

 I first noticed one day that the car was hunting for idle, oscillating
 between 600 and 1200 RPM's. When I got an open spot I floored it and got
 only 1.3 BAR on the boost gauge. Seemed it was in the limp home mode,
 running fine just no boost. So when I got home I checked for loose
 connections or vacuum lines, jiggled a few wires but did not find any real
 obvious problems. However, the next day the idle was fine and the boost was
 back to 1.8 BAR. To make a long story short, for the last month I have had
 the boost some days and not had it on others. The only other symptom I am
 aware of is the idle problem, which seems to always accompany the loss of
 boost. One last piece of info, when the car is without boost, I have been
 able to turn off the key while moving at moderate speed and then back on
 again and the boost will return, until I have to stop, which allows the car
 to idle again and I loose the boost. Turning the car on and off at idle does
 not seem to help.

 I have hesitated on putting the car in the shop due to the irregular nature
 of the problem. I hate to go in without some idea of what might be wrong.
 Anybody got any ideas??

This is my first posting to porschephiles.  Thanks in advance.

I have been performing the spring service on my 1980 911 and attempting to
find the cause for an increasingly rough idle.  If the CO is set correctly
at idle the car runs rich under load.  I think the right side of the engine
has an air leak somewhere.  I suspect the number 5 cylinder air boot to the
air box.  My question is - how does one change these six boots.  It appears
that you remove the whole CIS system from the heads up.  Is that correct?
While at it I plan to change the injector O rings and injector sleeves.  Is
there anything else that should be changed while I am at it?  The car

And btw, I view top speed as a pretty bad criterion,
considering that you guys are talking *engines* and top
speed in a 356 (or any car that's got enough revs to
get there) is strongly affected by aerodynamics.
Iffn (sorry :-) I wanted to increase my top speed
I'd invest in wind-cheater pan, flat window seals,
blocked off horn grills, etc.  Three percent better CD 
is three percent faster. Three percent more HP is only
one percent faster.

Does unplugging the throttle position switch disable the idle speed

One thing you can do is check to see if it is generating any voltage.

It can be done in an afternoon.  I replaced mine a few years ago.  I
can't remember all the details, but I do recall unbolting the bracket
containing the 9246 test relay socket from the tub, which allows the
big wad of hoses and wires above the cylinder to be folded back out of
the way.  Once you can get to the cylinder, I don't remember it being
very hard to remove.  I believe there is a gasket that is supposed to
be used which does not come with the new cylinder.  I traced my old
one (which was too damaged to be reused) onto some gasket material and
cut out my own.  Probably the most challenging part of the project
will be bleeding the system after installation.  This subject has been
discussed many times on this list, so you might want to check the
archives on this one.  Pressure bleeding seems to work best (this is
the only way I have ever been able to do it).

  Status:    Free redistribution in any form.
  By Kyle G. Ehler

 Harumpa! 
 Perhaps my 'Finest Hour' heh heh.  Thanks Dave.  Hope y'all are enjoying
this as much as i..
  
  I took time to 'scope this out further.
  And found that I lied about the 'kilovolt range' of the zapping impulse..
It measured out to be around -350 volts referenced to battery ground.
 -which is incorrect...the switch contacts are inline with the +12 directly
from the battery, so there is no ground reference as far as the contacts
are concerned other than that in the return path thru the battery.
  The impulse measured across the contacts is around -150VDC, it arcs
and occurs only on circuit break.  I also took time to measure the current
the solenoid consumes: 4 Amperes max.  This is not bad considering the size
of the silver-plated switch contacts, they should easily handle that for
many cycles.  When I place the 1N4004 rectifier across the solenoid to 
ground, the impulses where shunted enough that my 35MHZ scope could'nt
see any change from the energizing-de-energizing event.  In other words,
no more zapping the ignition switch contacts, and thereby extending the
life of the switch and greatly reducing the chance of starting problems
if you have a new or refurbished switch (clean contacts).
  If i had a 'real' scope like a DSA 602, I could tell us all exactly how 
big the impulses really are, but for our purposes we dont need the split
hairs.

  If I may humbly proclaim: This root cause is hereby closed (for 914's).
  
  Anyone know if other pcars suffer this starting malady? 
  -but this chapter is not over.

  Folks, after all this grandiose effort..it didnt fix *my* problem!

  Subject: Kyle needs a steering console and Re-keying 914 ignition locks.

  Hi gang.
  This could happen to you if you drive a very used 914.
  I'm posting this as followup to the 914 ignition switch post.
  My starting problem was not as simple as a bad switch -it was the key
tumbler.  It  appears the key tumbler has a tip that engages the ignition 
switch and if that tip is worn enough the switch wont reach the 'start'
position.  There is, however an outside chance that i am wrong because
during the 'Root Cause Analysis' of the tumbler, i *think* i saw a fragment
of metal that may have been jamming in the mechanism and preventing full
travel, but i'm not sure since I destroyed the assembly in an attempt to 
remove it from the console body. Shortly, i'll do a post-mortem on the
remains.

  Major bummer here since I had just finished
re-keying the door lock to match the single key and now I am doubtful of 
ability to re-key an ignition tumbler to match my car's
other locks.  My only other option is to purchase salvage parts of matching
keys and re-key the items that I know i can.  A Saga living up to its name.. 

  Can a 914 ignition lock be rekeyed?
  Anybody else been here-done it?

  Unless re-keying is possible, I will be in need of a steering console.
  The one provided to the 76 year model is dogshit, so i might not want 
another one unless it was cheap (and to keep this car yearwise oem).
Alas, my pickup truckful of parts has no spare consoles, possum peed or not.

  Parts I need;
  One steering console with key. 914 year models 72 to 74 (75,6 considered).
  no steering wheel, no wheel shaft, no mounting plate/bearing carrier.
  I *do* need the upper shaft bearing.
  no ignition switch, no wiper switch, no turn signal switch.

  For these parts I will gladly give my left macadamia -er $50 - 75? meship
  Or maybe a trade (color pix of my ROTISSERIE) just kidding, its late.
  If anyone is interested, I have an article describing how to re-key the 
door locks on a 914.  This time I really have it..just checked, yup.

  I'm snowed under and have not written the seatbelt retractor recycling
article, the belt in Saga is in need but there are other priorities
inline.  Sorry again, folks.  I'll get this out before the AX season 
gets hot.

The factory 914 manuals do NOT include ant wiring diagram for a 914/6.  The

Hello Everyone!

It's a sad day.  My '74 914 1.8L has got to find a new home.  It's a parts car
or a VERY SERIOUS restoration project for someone else (I did once!  That's 
enough!)  Here's a brief list of stuff.  Contact me for more details.  Prices
are unstated but rest assured they are CHEAP and NEGOTIABLE.  I basically have
to get the poor thing out of my way and I'd like for it to help out a few 914s
that are still on the road!  The car is complete and was running when parked
less than a year ago.

L&R Door glass - good cond
Rear glass - non-heated variety, good cond
Top - been sanded and painted and has chips
F&R deck lids - good, straight cond.
All Carpets - original, fair to poor shape
All gauges - all working and good to fair shape
Center Console - good shape
seats - slightly worn w/ standard rips
5 Steel wheels, 5 bad tires!
F&R Suspensions - complete
1.8L Engine w/ FI - completely rebuilt ~40k ago, runs great (honest!)
Transmission - original w/ recent 1st gear dog teeth & synchros
Steering Column - how about it, Kyle?

If someone wants the whole car, delivery to the midwest is possible.

Let's Talk!  If you want a good deal - call ME, not Automobile Atlanta!  :-)

Yesterday I stated that, for top speed purposes,

than a one percent boost in horsepower.

I lied.

Still, improving drag is something to consider.  
Altering a Cd from say 0.36 to 0.33 without changing
any of the panels is not out of the question. That's
the equivalent of ten more ponies in a 356 ...

Is this for getting some tension into the seatbelt retractor?  I took apart
my seatbelt retractors 3-4 times last summer before I decided that the
spring was just too tired and wouldn't give enough tension no matter what
I tried.

Eventually I got a used Beetle seat belt (the retractor mechanism is the
same, but mounting is all different), and used the spring from that one
in my 914 retractor.  Works like a charm!

Or was there something more to it?  I must have missed the original article.

My 85/2 944 has started making a weird noise, at all speeds, I think it is
the alignment but Im not sure, the noise is a very deep whirring noise (in
the front) that increases in left banks and decreases when banking to the
right, does this sound like an alignment problem or could it be a loose
something or perhaps a wheel bearing?

Well I got my recliners apart, or most  of the way apart, to have them
rechromed, Im not sure if they are all the same as mine but, my gears were
apparently originally chrome plated, the same as the rest of the unit, so I
would imagine that having the gear rechromed along with the rest of the
assembly wouldnt hurt it,In reply to a remedy to the seat falling back, I
asked my friends about it back home, there were two solutions, one which was
resonable the other was kind of out in left field. the good one: was that the
spring that regulates the gear lever for front/back motion could be worn out
or the lever itself could be bent allowing the lever to stay engaged just
enough so that the seat falls back a couple notches before engaging, The not
so reasonable fix: another friend said that it could only be the gears and he
offered to fill in the gear with some kind of weld then re-machine the teeth.
before going that far Id buy a new set of used recliners, :)

I don't know if everyone has heard of the James Dean Spyder legend, but
the car has had a really mysterious past.  It seems that the Spyder that dean
was killed in has been at a few shows (in the past) to show the effects of
a car crash.  The engine and tranny were put into another car, and the driver
of that car was killed.  The original Spyder was in transit, when it fell off
of the semi carrying it, killing drivers behind the truck.  Then the body of
the spyder diappeared.  The engine is somewhere, but the tranny, as of 1990
was going to be put into another car (pretty sure it was a spyder or one
that was a replica) by someone in New York.

Question:  Has anyone heard who has the tranny, and if so, how it has 
performed.  At the time I heard all of this, it was on Americas best kept
Secrets, back in '90 or '91.  Just wondering how it all turned out...

Subject: Koni adjustable shocks for sale

Hello 944 and 924S owners,

I have a set of Koni adjustable shocks that will fit a 944 or 924S.  They
originally came as a part of the sport option (M30).  The Porsche part numbers
are: 944.343.059.01, and 944.333.032.01.  The reason they are for sale is
that about six months ago (at the time of the fall Automotion sale) I bought
a set of new Konis and had them put on my car not realizing that the car was
already equipped with the same.  When my mechanic gave me back the old parts I
was horrified to see my mistake but it was too late.  The new shocks do have
the benefit of being easier to adjust in the front than the old ones but
this convenience doesn't justify the money spent.  Oh well...

In any event I have no need for the old Konis and would like to sell them.
Please make me an offer if you are interested.

After a notorious battle with my Ford, installing both new (almost) engine

Sunday I replaced the lower portion of the toeboard, it was rust in the 
lower area, and a repair panel was bought.

The fit of this panel was OK, but not like the danish parts I've used so far.
The job was not fun,....to much unergonomic working positions, I felt like 
the 'snake man', and I'm still stiff in the neck, ......

After some hours metal work I'm now ready to install the pan in my car!!

After that I'll have to do some work on the rear inner wings, but that's 
peanuts by now....

I've also started building the rotisserie, a lot of welding still has to be 
done as I've mostly spot welded so far. It'll be mush nicer welding the 
undercarriage of the car when it is mounted upside down.....

Subject: re: spraying oil under your car


      Rust in Houston isn't much of a problem (unless you live at the coast)
     but if you want to cover any nick under your car I'd suggest;

     1. Chassis black paint; this is an asphalt based paint, which makes it
        easy to spray over an old (and maybe not clean) surface. It is
        only available in gallons, but it is cheap.

     2. DP-90 primer; This is a zinc-oxide epoxy primer, this stuff is    
        great,adhesion is excellent and it acts as a sealer. My first
        use of this was on wrought iron furniture--with no undercoat
        or topcoat over the sandblasted metal, that furniture still is
        rust-free sitting outdoors for over a year. 
         Because no type of acrylic can really stick over an oily surface,
        though, the asphalt-based Chassis black is probably the best choice
        to respray and is environmentally and otherwise a lot better choice
        than dripping oil everywhere.                      

      3. Putting undercoating directly over bare metal isn't a good idea,
         you may actually trap moisture between the undercoating and the 
         metal. The Undercoating really is there to help the rust-protecting  
         primer coats from getting bashed off (and quieting the car).

         Your last choice is to avoid rust is to move to Arizona ! Lee A.

Thanks for the responses to my query on shocks.  I didn't get any opinions on

Not very well. And it's worse -- the "new" locks you get at the dealer
are *NOT* the same as the old ones -- they look different, etc. There
*IS* a Porsche part number kit for "re-key the whole car" that's about
$200 or so -- new door, ignition, glove box, rear trunk, and front 
trunk release locks. You can also get this for 911s. I *assume* you can 
do so for the other cars, too, but have no reason to know (although I'm about
to have to figure this out for 356s...)

>   Anybody else been here-done it?

Now, that's a silly question... 8{P

Seriously, it's *TONS* easier on a 911 -- I routinely get new ignition
locks re-keyed to match the rest of the car. But on 914s, I've had
nothing but bad luck... once, *ANY* 914 key would turn the lock...

Hi, Robert.
 
>Altering a Cd from say 0.36 to 0.33 without changing any of the panels is
>not out of the question...
 
I tried to find what the factory claimed for the Cd of the 356. Dirk-Michael
Conradt's book, "Porsche 356 -- Driving in its Purest Form," has a chapter
in the back, p. 194, giving the results of modern wind tunnel tests on the
356 series. When Porsche brought its new wind tunnel online in 1988, they
needed to practice on something, so they trotted out some cars from the
museum. Unfortunately they did not do a late-model coupe, but the early
coupe (the former test hack nicknamed "Ferdinand," a 1950 model once given
to Ferry Porsche's father, Ferdinand, as a birthday present) had a Cd of
0.296.  Front lift coeff Clf = -0.077; rear Clr = 0.359. These values were
determined with an airspeed of 87 mph (140 km/h). All the other cars tested
had higher Cd, because they were open cars or, in the case of the Abarth
Carrera, were just plain bad aerodynamically.
 
Ferry Porsche said (p. 37 of the same book) that he liked the Gmuend coupes
better from an aerodynamic standpoint. "In terms of outward visibility and
aerodynamics, the Gmuend version with its curved quarter windows and very
thin A-pillars was superior to the Stuttgart car."
 
It would be interesting to do coastdown tests with my car, in stock form and
with bumpers removed, narrow tires fitted, all air inlets and door and hood
seams and rain gutters taped. I can do the coastdown tests, but they take a
long time, have to be repeated about 10 times in each direction to get useful
averages, and then the data stream from my test gear crunched in a spreadsheet
program. I could determine Cd given frontal area and rolling friction. It's
possible to get a good approximation to rolling friction from the data, as
it's usually modelled as a linear term, directly proportional to speed,
while aero drag is a second order function of speed.
 
You could probably fit a belly pan of some sort too, although the 356 is
fairly smooth. Just close up the gaps under the trunk and between the
battery box and front apron, and in the back under the trans and behind the
engine.

Subject: Re: Adjusting Konis?

Steve,

I adjust by "feel". I start out at about half-firm, and crank it up a bit
each run group until I feel it is getting too stiff (wheels not staying in
contact with ground when braking over bumps is one indicator), then back off
a bit.

For example, at Watkins Glen, the "right" feel seems to be about 3/4 turn
from the softest setting. Your results may vary (of course).

I would also offer the following thought on tires: it seems to me that street
compound performance tires (Dunlop D40, Bridgestone RE71 (NOT the "R"
compound), etc.) offer more "feel" for the student than a more agressive tire
such as the Yoko A008RS, Comp/TA R1, etc. In time the stickier tires will
naturally help you go faster, but they tend to have a narrower margin between
sticking and letting go, IMHO. Once your sensitivities are sharpened, a move
to the less communicative stickier rubber just increases the fun factor. My
point is, I wouldn't necessarily recommend buying a set of A008RS's for
someone's first track event. You'll use up the street rubber quickly enough
anyway, and then you get to go tire shopping...

     Lou

Question: Does anyone know the actual definition of "drag coefficient" Cd?
Drag force is proportional to speed squared, and I suppose this is

Actually, it's hard to maintain any more enthusiasm for the exchange
at all. The big problem is that apparently the Maestro engines
are too wimpy to face any kind of challenge. Either that or it's just
that the Maestro and all of his customers are too wimpy. Either way,
it was spelled out in detail what the challenge was (beat Pete, autox
or top speed, and he'll pony up one NOS oil cooler plus acknowledge
that Maestro isn't just a phony tag dreamed up by some phony builder,
fail and you have to give him the oil cooler). So the right way to
have this discussion end is either:

1) Face the challenge
2) Admit you're a wimp
3) Admit you know you will lose.

neither of which has happened, and the indication is that the default
state of "2) Maestro is a wimp" seems to hold. Now I can't build a
356 engine that will beat Pete, and I know that for a fact. Do we have

If I say my car is faster than yours, and state that

Subject: Seat recliners early 912

Hi, Sam (?)
 
Yesterday I started reassembling the seat recliners of my concours
restoration 356, so maybe I can help you debug the mechanisms. It's harder
to do without photos.
 
OK. Reading from the outside in, you should have:
 
1. the vertical chrome piece of the recliner (attaches to seatback)
 
2. a thin plastic spacer ring/thrust washer. These usually deteriorate, and
when people don't put them back in, the chrome recliner parts just rub
against each other. You can make your own in about 10 minutes (I did it
yesterday) from sheet styrene (but teflon is better). The original rings
were 32 mm ID x 45 mm OD x 1 mm thick. I used 1.5 mm styrene. That's not
right, so I might redo it if I find
some 0.040 inch (about 1 mm) teflon later today. I used a circle cutter in a
drill press (in this case a "General" brand circle cutter, their no. 5B,
available at most hardware stores, $11). The ID must be big enough to slip
over boss on the retaining ring, #5. I go into such detail on the rings
because I think they're important and their absence may contribute to
seatbacks not staying up. Without them, #4 is free to rock slightly on #5,
and this may be why your gears are disengaging to let the backrest flop.
 
3. Pinion gear with fine-splined shaft, trapped between the chrome recliner
parts and engaging the curved rack on the outer (upper, or vertical) recliner
part, #1. The outside recliner (left on driver side) has a longer splined
shaft than the inner side recliner.
 
4. The lower, horizontal, chrome recliner part that attaches to the lower
seat cushion.
 
5. Retaining ring. Goes through hole in #4, and spacer #3, bears agains
inside of #1. Do not overtighten, should be snug sliding action between
recliner parts #1 and #4. If you overtighten, recliner can't recline, but
you'd need special tools and brute force to overtighten.
 
6. Lock washer over retaining ring. Slip lock washer over post, with tab in
slot used for return spring, #8. Use punch to dimple
lockwasher to fit into notches in #5. This keeps #5 from loosening and
maintains the slip fit between the recliner parts.
 
7. Sort of a 1" dia. helical-cut gear arrangement, which actually sets the
different backrest angles. The groove in this is engaged by a tang on the
adjusting lever, and it slides on the fine splines of #3. The helical gears
engage mating gears welded onto the inside of #4. If this is broken, or
teeth are worn severely on this or the mating part, it's probably best to
hunt for another recliner.
 
8. The return spring. I find it easy to install when the chrome parts are
clamped in a vise (use wood blocks to prevent damage, use duct tape on
chrome just in case) and the free end of
the spring is grabbed with vise-grips to hook it in. Wear safety glasses.
 
9. Snap ring on splined shaft of #3, to limit travel of adjusting lever and
#7.
 
10. Plastic cover over recliner mechanism. On 356s these were gray plastic,
on early 911/912 these were black. There are four distinctly different
moldings, for driver side inner and outer, and passenger side (with backrest
lock) inner and outer. If this is not present, the backrest adjusting lever
can slide too far back, disengage the groove on #7, and the backrest flops
back. If you don't have these (and by this time they are usually brittle and
falling apart) I know that Gary Emory of Parts Obsolete in Oregon still had
some a year ago, for the early 911. I couldn't find any for the 356 so I
made my own molds and formed them myself. I think this cover is very
important to make the mechanism work right.
 
11. Rubber bootie over fine splined shaft of #3. Not critical.
 
12. Bar that runs across to the splined shaft of the other side recliner.
 
 
That's about it, except that the passenger side is a bit more complicated
due to the backrest release arrangement. Works the same though.
 
If the return spring on the adjusting lever works well enough to pull #7
back against #4, that's not the source of your flopping problem. I would
look instead to a missing #2 (spacer ring) or #10 (plastic cover), if the
helical-gear-like parts look OK. The big pinion gear and the mating track
inside #1 are unlikely to ever break or wear.
 
Does that help?
 
Pete

But seriously, with all the talk about car jacking, I'm afrad the

a lot fewer beat-up '68 Plymouth Valients become the target of

Funny that someone else is complaining about the noise on a Targa.
 
I also have a targa. The top was made of cloth instead of the normal
vinyl. I later updated to vinyl.  I inserted a thin layer of foam on
the top before I put on the new vinyl top.  The end result was much
better.
 
Before I install the new top, I've also tried taping a long piece
of clear tape along the front edge of the top. That  kept the lip down
and reduced the noise a great deal. Unfortunately, the tape doesn't
hold very long and once it is loose, it made more noise than before.
It was also a hassle to remove the tape everytime you want the top
off.

Some folks will find this to be near heresy, but:

for the car mainly driven onthe street, with casual autox and track day
use, KYBs are just fine. In fact, they may be better. KYB Gas-A-just
shocks have this interesting feature: they "pump up" on successive excursions.
As a result, they get stiffer as you drive them harder, but go
back to "normal" when you're done... ANd you don't have to adjust anything.

They're also cheap: under $200 for a set for most applications. So,
if they wear out in 3-4 years, who cares?

Other interesting data points: Tad Haas's  flame-breathing 2.0-beating
1.8 liter 914 has a set. Several years old at this point too (installed in
'88 I believe). My 911SC autox car has 'em.

Other data points: I use Konis on my 914 race car, because of the infinitl
adjustable coil-over gizmo for them (but sport yellows, not street
shocks). Also, I use Konis on my 356SC. And my BMW R90/6.

And we use Bilsteins on the EP 914, and on the ITB Scirroco. So I think
we have the shock situation pretty well understood...

Well that depends. If I'm not doing it because I'm a wimp, I'm not

I know that, and I'm not afraid to let it be known that I am aware

And no, there is no chance whatsoever of me trying to win some brain-dead
bet about running 100mph+ on public highways. Go get yourself killed or
arrested - or meet me (and maybe beat me) at the racetrack. I may be
afraid to go as fast as the car can but I can assure you that I am NOT

The definition of "drag coefficient" is the ratio of the drag force per unit
area to the velocity pressure (reference the CRC Handbook of the Tables for
Applied Engineering): F_D=(C_D)*(A*rho)*(V^2)/2, where A is the surface area
of interest projected normal to the fluid velocity, rho is the density of the
fluid (air for a car), V is the velocity of the fluid, F_D is drag force per
unit area, and C_D is the drag coefficient. 
Hope this helps.

Subject: Buzzer Noise

My 1983 94 is equipped with an incredibly obnoxious buzzer which sounds to warn
me:

 (a) that the driver's door is open while the key is still in the ignition; and
 (b) to warn me to fasten my seatbelt.

When this buzzer goes off, the sound is picked up by my radio.  This occurred to
such an extent with my old stereo (the OEM one) that the radio was unlistenable.
I have recently replaced the OEM stereo with a new high-end Sony unit
(AM/FM/cassette and CD changer).  While the sound that s audible on the radio is
greatly reduced (no doubt due to better noise filtering), it is obvious that the
buzzer is still putting out large amounts of electrical noise.

Has anyone else experienced these symptoms?  What can I do to eliminate the
problem?  If worst comes to worst, I would happily disable the buzzer.  Does
anyone know how to do this?  Cutting the right wires shouldn't be difficult for
me, so long as someone can tell me which wiresare the right ones to cut!  8-)

By the way, it may or may not be related, but my old stereo picked up massive
amounts of alternator noise.  The new Sony does not suffer from any alternator
noise.

For what it's worth, I think I have the same problem as you, except that my
noise is coming from the right rear wheel.  Your description of a "deep whirring
noise" is bang on.  The noise is quite prominent, isn't it?

When I first noticed the sound, I thought that somehow the tire might be rubbing
the body, so I pulled over and gave all four wheels and tires a very close
inspection.  However, I couldn't find anything.  When I got back in the car and
started driving again, I noticed that I could make the noise disappear by
loading up the right side of the car, such as by making a left turn or by going
through a left curve.  On straightaways and through right hand curves that
loaded up the left side of the car, the noise persisted.  The pitch of the noise
goes up and down with wheel speed.

I figured that there were three main possibilities: (1) brake rubbing; (2) CV
joint; and (3) wheel bearings.  The consensus from most people, including a
couple of mechanics, seems to be that the noise is from the right rear wheel
bearings.  The question I now have is whether this needs fixing. What happens if
I keep driving the car this way?  If the only problem is the irritating noise,
I'll live with it.  If further damage would be caused however, I don't want to
be penny-wise and pound-foolish.  Also, what is the procedure for fixing the
problem?  Do parts need to be replaced, or is it simply a matter of cleaning and
lubricating the bearings?

Well, Kevin, that's exactly what I did. I apparently wasn't careful
enough, because I managed to twist the steel line.  I also bent
my 19mm wrench...not the socket, right in the middle.  That's how
hard I was torqueing on that sucker and it still wouldn't come
loose!

There must be a trick to this fuel filter crap.  I installed the
new line on the pump and installed the new filter.  I thought I put
the filter on pretty tight, but it still had a slight leak.  The more
I tightened, the more it leaked. Finally got it tightened enough to
stop 99.8% of the leak.  That sucker is on there tight!  I just can't
believe the filter has to be torqued that much.  Would teflon tape
help next time?  A washer?  Anything?

Kevin,

I don't know anything about this legend.  I do know that Jack Styles
has a transmission which he has identified as having come from that
car, and is basically building a 550 or 550A around it.  He has mated
it with an engine which was apparently a factory test mule, and has
some pretty interesting history itself.

Jack works at Gull Wing Restorations in Essex, MA.  You may have heard
of them as the place which did Lauren's Bugatti Royale, among other
cars.  Our PCA region visited them early this year.  Quite a shop!  In
addition to more 300SL's than you thought could possibly exist in one
place, they have a lot of much earlier and some very bizarre cars.

I can't remember all the non-SL cars they had, but one was a GT40, and
the other was a blue Ferrari, perhaps a 250?  The Ferrari was drop-
dead gorgeous, an absolutely exquisite car.  And its owner really
drives it, you can tell from the patina.

Their facility is huge, and they have a whole room filled with every
kind of weird panel-forming-the-old-way piece of torture chamber
equipment you could imagine.  And a whole room just for leather and
upholstery work.  Want a set of correct luggage for your SL?  No prob,
they will make it up from scratch.  With the correct, original
materials.

The 550(A) is, at this point, a frame, the front suspension, the
transmission and motor, and a few front panels.  The panels were all
hand made from scratch, although not at Gull Wing.  The project is
on hold for the time being, for financial reasons.

Subject: Early 1980's 928 market value 


Hello All: 

I'm looking into buying a 1981 928 and I'm looking for a little help.  I
spent the weekend reading through the Porschephiles archives and I think I
have a pretty good handle on the potential mechanical problems.  What I
have been unable to nail down is the market value of the cars and the
market trend. 
 
What's a price range to consider for the cars?  It seems that the 928 
market has been experiencing a severe downward trend over the last 5 
years.  Has this trend bottomed out?  Where do you think the price trend 
for the cars is headed in the future -- short or long term?  

The fella that is selling the car quotes the typical price range as 8-12K. 
He is asking 9.5K because the car has cracked leather seats, worn tires
and a weak sunroof motor (electric motors in general?).  I noticed that
the engine seems to die when you rev up to 4-5K rpm and then let off the
gas -- completely dead until 600 rpm at which point it "wakes up" and
returns to idle (BTW, it's a stick, light blue, excellent exterior, 72K
miles).  A friend in Michigan quotes a typical price range for early '80's
928's at 6-10K.  Do you think the typical range is 8-12K or 6-10K?  What's
a reasonable offer? 

Thanks in advance for any information,

Paul Nowak

by this (and the others') endless dribble of attacks which seriously lack
any trace of intellectual or entertainment value.  I'm no engine jock, but
I think I'm a decent judge of character.  Harry wins.

Let's say, for just a moment, that someone else's engines are better than

anyone else's engines are that much better than The Maestro's, else he
would have been out of business a long time ago (something about "free
enterprise").  Personally, I have a 356 sitting in the garage, waiting for
restoration (and it'll have to keep waiting for a number of years to come).
If I hadn't seen Harry Pellow's writings and videos, I would have lost
enthusiasm and sold the car long ago.  As Harry encourages, I'm keeping the
356/912 faith!

The worst part of this rediculous thread of "discussion" is that a few of

Hi, Sam.
 
Footnotes to yesterday's posting re 912 seat recliners.
 
I found plastic spacers in my very late 356 recliners (or what was left of
them) but after going down to San Diego to talk to my upholsterer, he
pointed out that some cars used thin brass shims there. Now I remember -- my
daily driver (the "top speed challenge" car) had brass shims in there.
 
And the thickness doesn't matter. The plastic shims are 1 mm, the brass
considereably thinner, and looking at how the locking ring fits through the
32 mm hole in the lower chrome recliner part, it doesn't stick through far
enough for thickness to matter.
 
Yesterday I was unsuccessful in finding 1 mm teflon (supplier had 0.030 and
0.060 inch) but did get 1 mm styrene.

I've been very happy with a locksmith in my area, Balport Lock and Safe, at

had a Bosch aftermarket ignition switch in there. I found a Porsche switch
at a swap meet, but with the wrong key combination. He took it apart and
changed it to match the door key (which is also the original igniton key).
He took a new repro (kinda) transmission lock key and keyed it to the
existing trans lock (key was missing when I got the car) and also did the
same for the glovebox door using an NOS glovebox key blank. So now, except
for the lettering on the trans lock key, it's all "original" again.
 
The 914 is probably a more complex lock, but maybe he can help you.

Subject: Drag coefficients

Hi, Peter Abbamonte, Ronnie Shepherd.
 
Ronnie answered the question re definition of Cd.
 
The one thing that nobody seems to notice when carmakers trumpet the Cd
numbers for their new car is that they never tell you at what Reynolds
number (effectively, at what airspeed) they measure.
 
For example, most handbooks list the Cd of a sphere as 0.40, but it varies.
At very low flow rates, it can be as high as 3.0. It decreases steadily to
about 0.40 at Re = 2000, then takes a nosedive to 0.20 at about Re = 200000.
 
Reynolds number is just a number used to check on "similitude." In other
words, if you build a 1/5 scale model and test it in a water tank, you
can't just use 1/5 of the wind speed you expect the 1:1 model to see. You
have to juggle things so the Reynolds number is the same, not the airspeed.
 
Reynolds number is defined as Vd/(nu), where V is velocity, d is some
characteristic dimension (or scale factor), and nu is the Greek letter
representing kinematic viscosity.

Subject: 993 Cab spotted

Hi, Paul.
 
I just returned a 993 coupe last Wednesday, after testing for Autoweek.
Fantastic car. Interestingly, I think I'm the only one who looked at the car
and didn't like the high-mounted brakelight treatment of the coupe.
Originally, the factory had planned to have a thin body-colored roof
extension, maybe 1-1.5 inches long, housing the light on coupes, and that
basket handle thing on cabs. But somebody must have figured out that you
could use the cab solution on the coupe too, and save tooling costs, so
that's what they did. At least you can't see it when sitting in the car.
 
Another small point -- the US car has little black bumperettes front and
rear, probably for some detail of the crash test (protects marker lights in
low-speed crashes?). The Euro spec cars don't have these, and I think the
car looks cleaner without them.
 
Other than that, what can I say? It's the best 911 ever built. The only 911s
I've ever driven that were more fun were Hans Stuck's Brumos Turbo and any
911 to which I had the pink slip (especially the '84 Carrera). I guess I
could off the 356 collection and trade even up for a new 911, but I like the
idea of being a fleet operator.

    Uumm--I hesitate to ask, seeing the recent flame wars  (8-), but :
Do you really want to close up the area around the engine?  I was under
the impression that most of the cooling air for the flat-four came in
from below.  I think that gaining some Cd but losing your cooling is a
non-optimal solution ;-)    Would you just leave it on for one or two
of the top-speed runs?  How much would it shorten the life of your daily
driver?

Hi, John.
 
Thanks for your support.
 
You wrote that
>Now I can't build a 356 engine that will beat Pete
 
Sure you can. But you won't find the recipe in Pellow's books, because
all indications are that he's never done it. According to Pellow's books, my
engine should have exploded 40,000 miles ago. And frankly I can't build an
engine that will beat my engine, I let somebody who has climbed the learning
curve already do that for me.
 
There are lots of great engine builders around the country who will build
strong, reliable 356 motors. Cole Scrogham, Dick Hyland, Vic Skirmants,
Clark Anderson, Steve Schmidt, Tim Goodrich, Jerry Woods, Lukes & Shoreman
all come to mind. And they're a lot cheaper than you know who, and most have
been doing it longer than same.
 
As for the gravel on Mrs. Orcutt's Driveway, I mentioned it because the
sound of the stones hitting the wheel wells is disconcerting at first. But
it's not a gravel road; it's a 30-year-old asphalt road and gradually little
pebbles get loose and lie on the surface. Don Sherman, formerly of Car &
Driver and one of the best drivers in the car magazine business, once told
me that the Driveway is never a problem until you get it over 200 mph. He's
been up there, I haven't.
 
The neatest thing about it is that you can run there legally. That's why the
car magazines put up with boring trips to scenic Barstow. The highway
patrol comes out to check your road permits, and then they may hang around
and watch, just for grins. The CHP airplane guys come over every now and
then to pace you with their 160 mph Cessnas. I used to go out there 2-3
times a month, two hours out, 15 minutes putting the gear on the car,
30 minutes of blasting, 2 hours back home. Somehow it's easier to go 70 in
traffic, brain on cruise, and let the Ricky Racers in their lowered Integras
go by at 80, after you've just gone 150 or so.
 
As for a rust-off contest, I have a cheater for you: my 1973 Capri, which
spent many winters in Chicago. When I park it in the garage, close the door,
and turn off the lights, around about midnight you can _hear_ the rust.

I have this problem.

Problem is the motor housing is poorly clamped onto the pump base.  If 
the two aren't aligned perfectly, the pump shaft binds; this is what 
you hear.  I've spent umpteen hours trying to fix this, but I'm afraid 
the only answer is to get a better-built pump.

In liu of that, I simply repositioned and loosened (believe it or not!) 
the pump clamp, masking the problem.  The stiff water hoses pull the 
pump housing one way, and the clamp on the motor itself pulls things 
the other - this is where the problem occurs.

Yes, a bad coil could cause misfiring and poor running.  Although the 
symptom could theoretically appear only on one cylinder / spark plug, 
I'd more likely expect the misfiring to jump around to all spark plugs 
randomly, especially if you've just put new wires, plugs, and cap on the car.

A 'scope on the coil output would show you graphically if this is 
indeed your car's problem.

There should be O-ring metal washers on each end of the filter, 2 if

I don't think I'll ask him to build my next engine. Maybe that makes me

No kidding. My rust-free two-owner 356SC was only $4500. Of course, the

Subject: Re: On 120 MPH Challenges ...

I'll just second Tim's comment, without repeating it. 

A "second" because I have TWO 356s awaiting my time and financing.  I
rebuilt one of the engines, my first engine rebuild of any kind, using
Elfrink, Porsche workshop manuals, the Maestro's books, and a lot of
help from my PCA friends. I would have welcomed additional books from
any of the experts flaming here. I didn't believe on faith (or maybe
understand) everything any of my sources said, but with the addition of
a little reasoning and common sense, I got the job done.  It's
certainly no racing engine, but it's not a turkey rebuild either; it
runs smoothly and clean, I enjoy it, and it's stiiiil gooooing.  I
value all the above sources, and the net wisdom here, but I agree with
Tim that the Maestro is unique in providing humorous inspiration---and
the only formula I found for setting up the engine to get the
compression ratio I wanted.

Experienced engine builders and racers don't need all this help (and
they have their own inspiration and unique humor), but it works for
me.  Thanks, Harry, and Elfrink, and PCA.

Subject: sunroof trouble shooting

I am trying to trouble shoot my sunroof and was hoping to get some further
ideas on what to try.  The bottom line is that the motor does not operate
the sunroof. The scenario up to now is: the motor does not run while hooked
up to the wires and the sunroof transmission.  I have taken it off and
attached it directly to the battery and it spins freely.  Power is getting
to the switch and to the wires that attach to the motor (according to my
meter).  Now, when I hook up the motor to the wires it does not spin.
I have charged my battery in hopes that that would help, and it hasn't.
What should the output reading be on the meter at the leads that attach
to the motor? Probably a dumb question, but does the car have to be running?

Sounds definitely like a rear wheel bearing.  They are sealed units, so they
have to be repalced.  When they start making noise, they have to be replaced,
or eventually, they will fail.  They noise is an indication that the bearing
is pitting, which crates heat which will eventually cook out the lube.  It
won't fail instantly, but you wouldn't want to take a long trip.  Best advice
is to fix it at your earliest convinience.

Subject: New Porsche Poster

Celebrate the classic 911 design. The Patent Poster Company has just issued a 
series of 16 posters based on original drawings from the U.S. Patent & 
Trademark Office. The subject of one of the posters is the 911. If you are 
interested in obtaining a copy at a 20% discount read the rest of this note 
for more information.

I'll try to describe the poster. It consists of five views of a 1964 911 coupe 
 - front 3/4, right side, front, rear, overhead. The drawings are pen and ink 
sketches. Body is colorized a faded purple. The background color is cream, 
with a faint blue/gray halftone enlarged graphic of the 3/4 view. Poster is 
bordered by a black band. Copy at the top is "FERDINAND ALEXANDER PORSCHE, 
JR., AUTOMOBILE, D199,433, PATENTED OCTOBER 27, 1964". Copy at the bottom is 
"PORSCHE AUTOMOBILE, F.A. PORSCHE, INVENTOR, PATENTED OCTOBER 27, 1964".

You may wonder about the color choice, but I guess the artist wanted to 
achieve an "olde world original" look to the poster.

If you'd like to be the first on your block with a copy here are the prices:

          9" x 12"    $ 3.95
         18" x 24"     15.95
         shipping       5.95 (per order)

The shipping looks steep, but you have to use pretty heavy tubes to foil the 
mashers in the US Postal Service. The shipping charge is per order - no 
additional shipping charge for more posters. If you're overseas, better add 
another $5.00. Send your check or money order to Richard Grayson, 
630 Wintergate Court, Alpharetta, Georgia 30202.

If you'd like to get a better idea of the poster before sending your hard 
earned cash, send me a SASE and I'll enclose a black/white copy from the 
catalog. If you have any other questions please respond to me directly.

This is a limited time offer, so please don't delay. I'm going to wait a few 
weeks before I place my order with the company. Let's set a deadline of May
1st. I'll tally the orders I have IN HAND on that date and place an order
for that number. If I receive your payment after that I'll send it back. 
It should take a week for me to get the posters and then another week for
mailing, so you should receive them in May. I'll post a short message on the 
net when they have been shipped. Thanks folks.

Richard

P.S. Forgive me if this note is posted twice. I originally had an
exclamation point in the note and Compuserve went bonkers when it
saw that. I couldn't determine if the initial send was successful.

Dear Peter:



       I just took a welcome break from doing Income Tax to find

       your nice little note on Porschephiles. Thank you so much,

       it's such a relief from Income Tax.



 You wrote:

>high school kid to edit your stuff?

 

    We start off on such a nice note.



Sorry. All the stuff I wrote to you I wrote myself, just as it 

says in the "Porschephiles" agreement. Oh, and my wife is currently 

upstairs, in bed.  Do you know where your wife is? Do you HAVE a wife? 

Or a LIFE???



    Incidentally, the Maestro couldn't help but notice that little 

typo of yours in your first paragraph above. Having a "typo" in 

your sentence urging me to hire someone to edit my stuff is yet 

another example of "Murphy's Law"! The Porsche gods may act in 

mysterious ways sometimes, but they sure do love Irony!



    Re: the ongoing, never-ending Fan Nut Debate. 



You said:

 

>The whole flame war started when you told _ME_ to TIGHTEN (not loosen) my

>still firmly attached to the generator, it merely hurled its blades.



    Well, you're right. I still don't get it. Ifin the fan really 

were "firmly attached to the generator...", then you really DON'T 

want to stick the pulley hub into a vice and try to remove the 36mm 

fan nut that is "still firmly attached to the generator" (your words 

from above, remember?).



     From my Own Hard School of Personal Experience, trying this can 

(and has) result(ed) in a sheared-off pulley-hub key, whose pieces- 

by the Powers of Murphy- wedge themselves UNDERNEATH the Hub and RUIN it. 



     Insidiously, before the key leaves its keyway, it'll also 

kill the the generator shaft too by "widening" the keyway grossly, 

thereby ruining most everything you were trying to save.



    Tell you what, how about you tighten or loosen your nuts 

the way you like, and I'll tighten or loosen my nuts the way I like. 

And we can move on beyond Fan nuts. That way, everybody's happy. 



Re: the 356 that beat the 911: 



>Your story about the customer who outran a 911 is quaint, but proves
nothing.

 

  Ah, yes. Quaint, but true. Who knows whether the 911 had a 

bad day, or was driven by a Dentist's wife. I do know that a 

Satisfied Customer was so happy and proud about what happened 

that he wrote me a letter about it. No brag. Just fact.



   And remember, ifin you call me a liar, you call the guy from

Massachusetts a liar too.   



   And maybe someday that guy from Massachusetts with the 

MaestroMassaged 356 who sloowwwwly pulled ahead of the probably 

poorly-driven, maybe in-need-of-overhaul 911, and DID beat him, 

will join Porschephiles, read your letter, and punch your lights out. 

Figuratively speaking, of course.



About conserving Precious Natural Resources, you said:



> Since when are you so concerned about wasting precious natural resources?
If

>so, you're in the wrong business. 

 

   Geez, talk about being in the wrong business. I used to be 

in the Nuclear business, working on the next generation nuclear 

reactor, (the Breeder), whose promise was 10,000 years of Energy, 

giving us enough Time to make fusion work efficiently. And looked 

what happened to THAT industry!



    Somehow, I think restoring worn-out 356/912's to Good Heath 

IS conserving Precious Natural Resources. Those wonderful 

precision-machined Aluminum cases made from that fine German 

Aluminum from all those Luftwaffe fighters, are damn near 

impossible to duplicate today. 



      Witness the Beauty of a Blackened Super-90 Cylinder Head. 

Or a New, Original Flywheel. They ain't makin' these things 

nooooo more, haven't for over 25 years. In my book, that makes 

356's and 912's an Endangered Species.  One we should conserve. 

Truly.



     And that's why I think 356's and 912's are made to be used, 

not abused. And why I don't like to destroy them by hard-core racing 

or driving down some woman's desert driveway with "loose gravel on 

surface and bumpy in spots".



   Speaking of that driveway: you said-



>I have no problem there, my personal record there is 172

>mph in a ZR-1 Corvette, hands off the wheel, with a CHP officer in the

>passenger seat. 

 

    Geez, how come the CHP officer there in the passenger's seat 

didn't arrest you for a DWS? (Driving While Stupid.) I believe 

that the California Driving Handbook says that taking one's hands 

off the wheel at 172 MPH is not a wise (nor sane) thing to do. 

Are you taking any medicine for this?



    Or is this "hands-off driving" part of your Rules for the Race???



    Speaking about the "talk on the Street", talk on the Maestro's 

side of the Street says that you've been burning up the Long 

Distance lines, calling among others, the publisher of the 356 Registry, 

in a desperate attempt to silence the Maestro's right of Free Speech. 

And his ongoing Story of Slander on the Internet: Roadkill on the 

Information Highway. Word is that "A Current Affair" has offered 

$500,000 for the rights to the Story. Film at 11. And a Network Movie

    But it won't work. The Truth gets out eventually.

                        Part 2







    What the Maestro has also heard about you and your engine 

is rather interesting. Let me guess. I bet you have a Super-90 

Coupe. That you bought, oh about 4 to 5 years ago, from the guy 

who broke down along the side of the road and was ticked off at 

his car for breaking down. So he sold it to you cheap. You later 

found out that the car was a Super-90 "GT" Coupe.  Hey, such a deal! 



     Then, oh some three years ago, you had the engine rebuilt. 

Let's say you used a De Long camshaft. Let's say you used the 

"Shasta" pistons that we all know are made by "JE". Bet they're 

the 86mm ones too. Bet the Maestro knows who bored the cylinders 

to fit those pistons! 



    Bet the Maestro knows who did most of the machine work 

on your engine too!



    The SAME "Independent Machinist" that the Maestro uses!



    So, guess what? You may have an almost "MaestroMassaged" 

Engine!!! Note that I say "Almost", because it wasn't assembled 

by the Maestro. 



    Boy, do the Porsche gods like Irony or do they like Irony?



    So, really, except for the brand of pistons and the De Long cam,

you have the same type of engine that the Maestro makes.



    CONGRATULATIONS on your wise choice!

   

    But a warning too:



        Ifin you have only been playing with 356's for, oh, say

5 years, it'll take you DECADES to realize how much more there 

is to know. The Maestro knows that well- after some five years, 

he figured he knew 95% of the important stuff about 356 Engines. 

It took him 10 MORE years tearing apart and rebuilding a LOT more 

356/912 engines to know how little he knew back then. 



After 20 years the Maestro still marvels at the things that come 

in the door.  Impossible things (well, Highly Improbable things, 

certainly). 911 Pistons in 912 cylinders with 2.5mm piston to 

cylinder clearance. Flywheel nuts  that fail at 150 ft-lbs. 

The missing (or wrong) parts in the currently available Elrink and 

Reinz gasket sets. Dowel pins for #3 main bearing that if installed 

wrong, fly into the crankshaft and machine the inside of the #3 

main bearing. Cam gears that are attached only by their dowel 

pins (no bolts) that come off in 50 miles.



     These things and how to avoid them he's tried to tell Others 

about in the Books & Video tapes- (and a little bit here, in between 

the Flame Wars), so others might learn from the experience and 

kindness of Others. (I was gonna use the kindness of strangers, 

but that line's been taken.)





You said:



>You say you've built these supermotors for 20 years, but now to take on 

>the Driveway you are building a cheater engine. Yes, I said cheater, 

>because your stock engines will not do the job and you feel compelled to 

>build a special motor for just this purpose. 



    Boy, that crystal ball again. Through a glass darkly. So that's

what the TV camera was doing in my Shop.



Then you say that:



>My engine has nonstock components in exactly the same locations where your

>customer engines employ nonstock components, but it does not have the same

>components...



   Now, wait a minute- you first say said I'm building a 

"cheater" motor, and then you say that your OWN motor employs 

"nonstock components". So, suppose, just suppose, that I was 

building EXACTLY the same type of motor that you built.



   Doesn't that makes your engine a "cheater" too???



   Let's face it- you haven't got the foggiest idea what engine I'm

building nor ANY idea of what's inside. So, stop pretending that you do.

It's unbecoming.



    And Remember that people in the 356 community talk. 



    You said:

    

>And the talk on the street is that you and the independent machinist who
does 

>most of your work are calling all the builders of hot 356s in the country
to 

>ask how it's done. 



     God, he's got a copy of the phone bill too! Must be someone else's

phone bill, 'cause it sure ain't the Maestro's!  

    

     I have, however, inquired of others about what makes you tick, 

and have been told Interesting Things. I especially liked the person 

who wrote in to Porschephiles, expressing rather frank views on what 

he or she thought about your personal attacks on me. I wonder how many 

others feel that way.



>That's how you learned about, and why you brought up, the piston

>failures for the Shasta pistons, and blame it on "metallurgy." The failures

>occurred under racing conditions, and metallurgy has nothing to do with it,

>and you know it. They failed after an estimated 18 hours of racing at 8000

>rpm, something your engines will never see. That's why you have ordered

>forged pistons of your own. Do as I say, not as I do?  Tell me Harry, what

>part of "street engine" don't you understand?



   Again, I don't know where you got your crystal ball from, 

but it's a little cloudy, and should be recalled by the manufacturer. 



The Truth about how the Maestro found out about the 

Shasta Piston Failures:



A Customer- in fact THE Customer who has been Vintage Racing one 

of my street engines (and winning, if you recall, with some SIXTY 

racing hours on it, not a mere 18, and with NO failures, 

piston or otherwise), called ME to tell me about the failures 

of the Shasta Pistons. HE said that his source had said that, 

apparently because of a Design Flaw, the Shastas were cracking.



    He said that JE, the manufacturer of the pistons had a "fix" 

that involved redesigning the piston and changing the  "metallurgy".



     Maybe if we're lucky, the Customer will join Porschephiles 

and post his nice article about all of this to all of us, so that 

you can see for yourself that which is True.



   You said:



>I figure the core value of my engine is $1000. You want to claim it for 

>$5000. If you will send me a check for $4000, I will tell you, honestly and


>completely, what is in it. 



    Thanks for your generous offer, but the proposed rule I 

suggested was that EITHER of us could BUY the other's engine 

for some agreed upon price, if they wished. The idea was to 

prevent "ringers" or $10K+ engine being built just for this "challenge".



   By the way, you never did answer my question from before- 

did you actually assemble your engine yourself or not? It's a 

simple question, but so far you haven't answered it.





KEEP THE 356 FAITH!!!

Subject: Easy as..........


Hi,

Yesterday I put in another three good hours in the Garage, I finished the 
K-member, the frame struts, and the righ tlongitudinal which was only spot 
welded from before. If one take good care before these pieces are mounted, 
(and one has danish quality parts) measuring and cleaning the surfaces, this 
job is peanuts. (at least when you've had a 'part_time_job' as a welder the 
last 3 months :)
 Now I'm still waiting for my punch/flange tool I ordered to make holes for 
spot welding the pan. When it arrives the front pan is going in with 
expresso speed. I checked my 'need to be weld' list and it's really looking 
nicer every day now.......!

There isn't much to say really about these jobs, I found them straight 
forward, only the jack receivers should be welded to the longitudinal 
*before* the longitudinal is welded to the car...... :(  ;)

There is a 'European Porsche Club meeting' in sweden 16-19 june, I really 
don't think I'll have my car ready by then, but I'll have to go there. See 
you Swede(s) there......? About 2500 cars is coming........I heard!

Need advice; I have the possibility to rent a 'paint-box', but would you 
recommend me to paint my car self? I'm not 'used' to paint cars, but my 
calculations tell me I can have this great Air-compressor with lots'a fancy 
equipment for the price of painting my car. As the down_to_earth guy I'm, I 
find it more and more difficult sending away my cars for a repaint I could 
learn to do myself....!! I have a lots of friends with older cars needing 
repaint, I could easily paint 5-10 cars before I had my 356 ready for the 
job. (read: excercise on *other peoples* cars  :) :)

What would *YOU* do ??????

Subject: Boxster Update...

Greetings!

    The April 11 issue of AUTOWEEK contains a blurb about the Boxster
in its "World News" section.  According to the article, "At least 4000
Americans have placed 'orders' with Porsche dealers..."  The mid-engined
prototype, which should be on sale in mid-'96 will be powered by a choice
of two engines:  a 2.0-liter flat four (170 hp) or a 2.4-liter flat six 
(240 hp).  Both engines are water-cooled.  (I wonder if the four came from
the VW Vanagon...hmmm...shades of 914 maybe?)  On the down-side, the car
as pictured looks less like the beautifully styled retro concept car, and 
more like a 968 cab.  Not that the 968 isn't a handsome car, but many of
us would like to see the concept car go straight to production (...do not
pass Marketing...do not collect 200 gadgets...) with the same silver
paint and red interior.  But then again, these _are_ spy photos, and the 
car is not in its final trim.  Porsche will likely have to rely on 
commonality of components to keep the price below the targeted $40k mark.
Some of the components, such as the entire nose substructure, will come 
from the 996.  The production Boxster will be shorter than the 911 with the
same wheelbase as the 968.  Sheet metal is to be produced at a BMW-owned
facility in the former East-Germany.

I have dealt with Woods before, and he is quite a reputable dealer.  His sales
on Fuchs alloys are the real thing.  They are usually 6" and 7" 911 take-offs I
believe.  However they are new, authentic, and inout-of-the-box condition.  A

There are interlock switches in the sunroof syustem that

Thre is a switch at the front in the middle, and one or two
in the back where the forks come out.

I suggest cheching those switches for proper adjustment and

Right. More important than the drag coefficient, Cd, is Cd times the
frontal area, Cd x A, of the car.
 
In college aerodynamics courses, a typical exercise for the student is to
figure out the drag caused by the wires of a wire-braced biplane, compared
to an airfoil section. They're usually amazed to find that those thin wires,
maybe 8 per airplane, add up to a significant amount of drag.
The Cd of a long cylinder (like a wire) is perhaps 1.0 (Re < 200000); the Cd
of a long wing, thickness/chord ratio 1:8, is perhaps 0.1 (Re = 1 x 10**6).
 
From the same chapter in Conradt's 356 book: (also listed are front and rear
lift coefficients, Clf and Clr)
 
Type                                 Cd      A       Cd x A   Clf    Clr

Abarth Carrera.......................0.414   1.495   0.619    0.072  0.284
 
What's interesting is the Abarth Carrera. Porsche had about 20 of these made
in Italy, on a 356 platform, in the hopes of having a smaller, slipperier
shape for racing. What they got instead was a high Cd. Its smaller frontal
area gave it a total drag not much worse than a Speedster, but the Abarth
coupe should have done much better than that. It came nowhere near the early
coupe, even with front oil cooler and brake cooling inlets taped over and the
engine cooling flap closed.

    Thanks for the updates on your 356. I'm still struggling with learning to w

     As for painting, I'm not vastly experienced.  I sanded in a body shop one
summer as a teenager.  Two  years ago I painted my VW.  It was a reasonable ama
teur job.  After conversations with the paint man, I was afraid of the hardener
 in the paint and I didn't want to shave my beard to insure the mask would seal
well.  I left the hardener out - bad mistake.  It still  looked OK, however.  S
ix months later a laundry truck slammed the rear of the car.  This time off cam
e the beard, in went the hardener and now the job was *almost* perfect.  So wit
h a few cars to practice on, I'm sure you'll do well.  When I finally get there
, I'll be asking the net for advice on which paint to use, what additives to in
clude, etc.  Besides, forom my point of view, if you can weld, you can obviousl

	I'm planning to go to Le Mans - a friend at work has arranged a
convoy of "interesting" vehicles (E-type Jag, Healey Frogeye Sprint, early
Land Rover, Alpine? - my 944 is the only P-car). We're heading over on the
Wednesday (15th) night so that we are there for practice on the Thursday
and Friday. Pit passes *may* be included (he knows some of the people who
will be preparing a Gulf sponsored 962!).

	Has anyone been to Le Mans before (I haven't)? What's it like?
Anything special to look out for? To do? How easy is it to see the cars up
close? The drivers?

	Also, I believe that there will be a joint Porsche Club Great
Britain/Porsche Club of America barbeque on the Friday (?) night - is
anyone going (it would be really nice to put some faces to the names on

	And June 18th is my birthday !!!

    Actually, I was referring to the "'63 S".  I didn't think that there was

    Also, Someone pointed out to me that the ass-engined Porsches get more/

Hi, DD.
 
You're right, you wouldn't want to block off the flow of cooling air. But on
a 356, that air passes through a very small area. Cooling air comes in from
the top, through the engine lid openings, and is drawn in by the centrifugal
fan. The engine is actually sealed very well toward the bottom, to prevent
drawing in hot air from the exhaust side. There are sheet metal panels and
rubber gaskets completing the seal between the engine and the body. The
cooling air, pressurized by the fan, blows down over the finned cylinders
and cylinder heads on either side of the engine. From there, it flows down
(and out) through 2 rectangular openings, the heater flapper boxes, only 4 x
8 inches, on each side of the case. You could shroud everything but these
cooling air outlets and not make the engine suffer (much).

Subject: My Trip to Porsche


What I Did on Vacation in Germany
(Doesn't that sound like something from a 6th grade student?)

First, I'd like to thank everyone who provided information to help
us plan our trip.

We spent 2 weeks in Germany and Austria (March 11 - 26).  It was
my first trip to Europe.  Being off-season, it wasn't crowded and
accomodations were inexpensive.  On the other hand, it was cool,
cloudy, and windy (but still warmer than it was here in Minnesota!)
and short winter hours were still in effect for most museums, etc.
Next time I'd go in May - in theory the weather is better, museum
hours are longer, and it's still off-peak tourist season.  I'd also
try to take a longer trip or go to fewer cities.

About a third of the days we stayed with relatives and friends.  It
was nice to talk with locals - both to get a sense of local history
and to get pointers for things to do/see.  "Non-tourist" towns have
fascinating histories, too.

The first two thirds of the trip, we traveled by train - the last
third we had a rental car.  Both methods of transportation have their
advantages, and I would do it the same way next time.  Driving on the
Autobahn is fun even in an Opel "pedal faster" Astra, I bet it would
be a blast in a real car.  ;-)

Our itinerary included: Nurnberg/Amberg, Berlin, Vienna, Munich, the
Romantic Road/Reutte, the Rhine, and Stuttgart, of course.

And now the important stuff...  We arrived at the factory 30 minutes
early and wandered through the museum before the tour started.  As we
checked in for the tour, the guide said, "Ah, Mr. Tietel.  We have been
expecting you."  (A look of puzzlement crosses my face, because they
haven't said anything like this to the other guests!?)  She continues,
"Please follow me, I have something for you..."  Confused, I follow
her across the lobby to a small cabinet, from which she removes a
plastic shopping bag that she hands to me and says, "Is it your bithday?"
"Uh, yes, next month," I reply.  "Enjoy your visit," she says.  And off
we go on the tour...  It turns out my parents had called PCNA and set
up this little suprise.  Pretty cool.
    On one side of the museum there was: a 550, RS60, a 911 Cab
connected to a "Pole Position" type video game, and a sampling of 356s.
On the other side were the Quaker State Indy car, F1 McLaren-Porsche,
Cistalia, a sampling of 917s (including Donohue's Sunoco) and the
Holbert/Bell/Stuck 956.  All incredible cars!
    The tour itself was great, but I wish it had been a bit longer.
It included: engine assembly (993 and 928), dyno testing, painting
(latex-based == no smell!), and powertrain assembly through final
assembly and testing.  As we walked by the 500E assembly building (the
former Reutter building?), several workers opened the (tinted) windows
to let us get a better look inside.  According to our guide:
    a) German industry rules (laws?) say that each engine must produce
       95% - 105% of its rated HP.  Porsche allows its engines the
       tolerance of 99.5% - 102%.
    b) after final assembly, 20% of the cars are chosen at random for
       a complete quality control check.  They basically take the car
       apart to verify *everything*...
    c) most cars destined for the US are red, white, or black.  The more
       interesting colors are are the Germany/RoW cars - Speed Yellow,
       raspberry, jelly-bean blue, hot pink, seafoam, etc.

I can't wait to go back!

	We had the injectors from the race car (Honda CRX Si with 110K) 
cleaned out back in '91 with Marren.  The car had been run on ONLY
92+ octane gas from Exxon or one of the other quality gas chains for
the last 60K with Techron added 1 or 2 times a year. When you send them your
injectors you get back a nice little printout showing the before/after 
on the injectors.  Out of the four that we sent I believe that was
one that was 5% down or so, but all the other were within 2% of stock.
Was the money workth it?  Well, for us the 5% is important, but even
more then that I _KNEW_ that the injectors were okay.  In terms of
performance the $100+ spent on injector cleaning probably was worth it
in case one injector is pretty far.

	I don't know whether it would be worth it in your case.  We are
always really careful about what kind of gas we run in Honda.  YMMV.

	The only other thing I would say is that when Marren shipped 
the injectors back to me they just left them loose in the box.  The
handling they received with UPS broke off on the plastic lips.  This is
not a functional piece, but I did write them a letter complaining about
that and received nothing back.  So, be careful with the shipping.

 I have an '81 911SC and my 6-month costs are around $650 for basically
recreational use (<10Kmi/yr).  I'm located in Pleasanton, which is a Bay Area
suburban/semi-rural area.  Deductible is a bite though -- $500!

I'm in california. Can any one relate data on what your insurance costs 
for your car ? I'd like to pick up a good mid 80s porsche. Possibly a 
targa. But regardless of the car you have, I'd be interested in hearing 
what it costs to drive it. Thanks

In my '81 $$931$$, I've noticed recently a substantial resistance
in getting the stick shift into first or second gear when the
car is cold in the morning. After about 10 minutes of street
driving, the problem slowly disappears, and shifting becomes
fluid again.

Is this a simple lubricant fix, or is there something more serious

Subject: Le Mans

Phillip,
  Le Mans is a wonderfull event.  I went a few years ago and ended up
getting very little sleep because something is always going on.  The night
of the race my wife and I went back to our room in the old part of the city
about 1 AM and I was back at the track by 5 :->  Point is, get lots of rest
prior to going.
  The German Porsche Club goes there every year and camps out.  Easy to
find, just look for a huge pile of beer cans and folks speaking English
(American?).  Wonderfull group.  Give them my best if you hook up, they may
or may not even remember me :-> I think I was VP of our region that year and
I brought a program they signed back to one of their members that had
returned to the states for some serious medical attention.
   Things to do?  Watch the race of course.  Many good corners to see lots
of action.  Pit passes will make it better.  There are (were?) 2 levels at
the time, Hot and regular.  I was lucky enough to get all access press
passes which gave me access to the press tower for the end of the race.
Which btw, if you intend to be by the start/finish for, you better be there
early.  About 3pm it's still somewhat open but near 4 it gets pretty thick
and on the last lap, the crowd starts closing in on the track.  Strangest
thing I ever saw, cars wizzing by still trying to race and people surging
out onto the track to watch the winners cross the line.  Near the end, cars
will come in to get cleaned up for the finish so all the decals can be read
on tv and in the press photos.
   There is also a fair that goes on during the event complete with
ammusement rides, and if your real lucky, you'll score some passess to the
pvt tents that the sponsors put up.  Great place to rest and snag some good
food.  They tend to be hard to get but worth it.  I'm told Porsche will not
have one this year but maybe your Gulf contact can get you into thiers.
   I envy you.

Hubert and Jon,

I agree in the diagnosis of a bad wheel bearing.  My car just came back
form the shop after having the right rear wheel bearing replaced.  It had
the same symptoms of a "deep whirring noise".  The sound varied in intensity
with cornering, and varied in pitch with speed.

If you have the steel rear control arms then there are two separate bearings.
These are pressed out.  If you have the aluminum control arms then you have a
single large bearing that actually has two bearings internally.  According to the
shop manual this is removed by taking the control arm off, heating it to 150C
and pressing out the bearing.  I have this type of control arm and my mechanic
removed the bearing unit with the control arm on the car and I think without
any heat.  I guess the results are acceptable but I was worried by the aluminum
traces that were left on the outer race of the old bearing.  This indicates some
damage to the control arm in the removal process.

In any event the car had been making bearing noise for about three months before
I replaced the defective part.  When I opened up the old bearing unit for
inspection I found that the outer race was in good condition while the inner one
had a serious pit in one location and was mildly damaged all the way around the
race.  I can't figure out how it got damage in this pattern.  (If any one has any
insight on this I would be interested.)

Anyway, looking at the construction of this bearing (the two in one uint) I would
guess that it would take a lot of abuse before an outrite failure occurred.  But
I would not just ignore the problem.

My cost of repair was:
	$65	replacement bearing from Zims.
	$120	labour (2hr @$60)
I think that the cost to replace the bearings in the steel control arms is similar.

Hi,

I'd like to thank everyone out there for your reply to my 'should I paint my

Every answer I got was positive, and I am now 95% sure I'll go buying a 
great setup of power tools, compressor and spray-gun,.....pity I have all 
this (xpensive) electric tools...... :)

356 progress:

Yesterday another 3 good hours in the garage saw the front and rear pan go 
into my '58. Everything was prepared and basically trimming the oversize pan 
and bending a bit to get it in place was the job,.....and yes, a few spot 
welds in each pan. Today I'll ask my brother over to get some downforce as 
I'm preparing to finnish the pans.

I'm taking pictures to show the work I'm doing, and the sight of all those 
red-primed underbody panels is a pure joy.....!!!

I've installed: New longitudinals, longitudinal supports, jack receivers, pan,
k-member, frame struts, battery-box(really pain_in_the _ass), toeboard lower 
part, made new heater tubes in the longitudinal(shit_work), plus I've done 
repairs to the front inner wings,the torsion bar area,and the tank floor 
plus more.....

I'm gonna write a little article when I find the time. I'd say I'm about 85% 
finnished when it comes to welding work on this car......(*HOORAY*) 

Everything seem so easy now,...........but I've worked hard to improve my

    were in a prepared 944). While we were not driving 10 10ths, we
    were straining to keep up with 993.  The 993 really looked awesome
    on the track and effortlessly ate up the turns.  After the
    session, I talked to the driver (the car only had 150 miles on
    it!!) and he said that it was completely stock and handled

Of course, John, I assume you don't mean to disparage the Wildflower Cafe,
which IMHO is not only the best place to eat in WG, but not bad objectively,
either. And I say this fully realizing that they didn't just misplace my

For accomodations, the Glen Motor Inn wins hands down. Their cable TV will
allow you to watch the F-1 races from Europe on ESPN in the morning if it's
raining too hard to make it worthwhile to drive up to the track (happens
often enough to matter). They also have an acceptable restaurant; innkeeper
Nancy Franzese will also gladly chat about current racing and the history of
the Glen and some of the GMI's past illustrious GP visitors. 

I also highly recommend Belhurst Castle, if you are willing to drive up to
Geneva.

Subject: Insurance quotes


People have been requesting and discussing insurance rates for their P-cars.

I have found that when I want to know how much insurance will cost me on
various cars, I get the best results by calling the agent that provides
insurance on my current cars. That way, I have an accurate number for the
kind of coverage I carry.

For instance, when I was looking to buy my 944 I called the agent and he
flipped through his book and responded "I don't see it listed here, I'll
have to get back to you." I ended up calling him later in the day after I
had bought the car and he said "The reason the 944 isn't in the book is 
because we don't like to insure those cars. But, since your other two cars
are insured with us, covering the 944 is no problem." It turned out the
cost was very reasonable.

On the other hand, if you want to do some comparisons between companies,
you might do as I tried once. An offer came in the mail to get a quote so
I called the company. After giving them the coverage levels I was interested
in I started listing the vehicles. '88 Mercury Sable. "Okay." '76 Chevy
pickup. "Okay." '83 Porsche 944. "I'm sorry we don't cover Porsches." I
thanked her and hung up. 

If you're interested in an accurate comparison, call the companies and
get the numbers for the same levels of coverage, same number of additional
vehicles with company, same number of tickets for the driver, etc. If you
just want to get a wild range of numbers, ask people what they're paying.

Oh yeah, if you don't drive your Porsche to work, be sure to call the
insurance company that PCA has worked with to offer really low rates. I
have heard they are very competitive but have some restrictions.

Me? I'm happy to live in Idaho where the rates are low.

A though came to mind recently about the possibility of having someone
design a porschephiles logo (ala the autocrosser's TEAM.NET racing)
that could be used on a T-Shirt, hat, stickers, patches, tatoo, etc... 

While my wife would surely cringe at the thought of me any more t-shirts 

(currently warehousing enough to clothe a small town) it would be nice to 

have something relative to porschephiles so we would be able to identify
each other at the Parade or other such events.

You can get these from the archives.

To isolate my "deep whirring noise" problem I felt for loosness in bearings
and CV joints but did not find anything abnormaly loose.  I then lifted
one rear wheel off the ground at a time spun it at highway speed (be very
carefull if you try this).  It became clear after this experiment which
side the problem was on.  So I replaced the bearing on that side since it was
the most likely suspect.  And as my previous mail stated, that bearing turned
out to be pitted.

Steve:

Having been through seven sets of street rubber (Comp T/A x 3, Pirelli P7 &
P700, Dunlop D40, and Goodyear GSC) plus several sets of auto-X shoes, my
observation is that road noise increases as the tread squares off from
wear.  One hypothesis is that worn tires are louder than new because the
tread has less room squirm and conform to the road surface. My wheel
bearing paranoia vanishes with each new set of tires.

Coasting or driving in and out of gear, tire growl seems to stay pretty
much in tune with speed rather than torque.  But who knows.  Maybe I have
had bad wheel bearings for the last eight years and just don't notice it
until the tires wear down?  I cured my latest paranoia attack with a fresh
set of A008P's, a very expensive diagnostic to be sure.

    PAM & DOUG-

    Thanks for your responses-

    Pam- As I recall, the sound does not change according to what
    surface I am driving on- do you think that rules out the tires?
    (Yes, the pressure/nuts/torque/wear pattern is fine.)  And I will
    check fans etc. as a precaution but I think it is mechanical in
    nature (I don't have AC/Cruise, etc.)  And I will try to check
    with a stethescope, but I think that the slight rubbing of the
    brake shoes (from the emergency brakes-  I understand that it is
    okay if they make a little noise, as long as there isn't any
    resistance) may mask over the bearing noise, what do you think?

    Doug-  could you explain the "cornering trick?"  Is this merely a
    change in the sound when you drive around a corner?  If so, I
    think it doesn't change, but I will check again anyways.  As far
    as wiggling a tire with the car jacked up, should I be checking
    for play the same way as I do with the front?

    Any more comments or input is appreciated.

I met with Tim Marren over a year ago, when I moved down here, regarding

called him just to find out what he knew about the various injector brands,
but this guy is a *serious* fuel injection wizard.  I was very very impressed.
He does a lot of big-name race cars, too.  And believe it or not, he may

He has a relatively small shop, but it's impressive.  I never actually used
his services for anything, though I did gain a lot of knowledge from him.
If you call him, be sure you've got plenty of time to stay on the phone...
I would recommend him for fuel injection related issues without reservation

Subject: Re: 944S: Timing Belt

Darren,

Well, this is gonna get ugly.  The first thing you have to look at is
the cost of the belt itself.  For the eight-valvers, its about $30.  For
the 944S, S2, and 968, list is currently... $182.  You'll also be
replacing the balance shaft belt.

You should tally up the cost of the rollers you will replace.
Not sure what they add up to.  We just did mine a few days ago,
after about 32K miles since last changed.  The belt was fine, but of
course got changed.  The pulleys were all noisy and loose.  Even if they
aren't, you won't be going in there again for a long time and should
probably bite the bullet.

Finally, there's the labor.  Dunno what book is, but I think about
two to three hours is reasonable.

This is often the time at which minor leaks get fixed: around the balance
and cam shafts, and at the oil pump.  The radial oil seals are
surprisingly dear.  You might also end up replacing a worn "slinger"
or spacer on the cams, or a similar piece at the oil pump.

  Sorry, this was at the midst of the heap..

  Ok, these babies are probably *crimped* connections because of heat, shock
vibration, etc.  Go to the 'shack and get some brass crimp on terminals
 -preferably with a 'barrel'.  It may be neccessary to remove some plastic
junk from around the terminal  -it depends on what you shop for.
  The 'barrel' should be sized to fit the two wires you will mash together
in it, and you may have to cut off a ring or spade to use just the crush
part.  Crimp it with those universal cut/strip/mash pliers. or vice-grips.
  Test the connection by pulling the wires..if they move crush more (but
dont destroy) or solder.  The heavier the terminal, the more secure the
crimp.

  Yah, I've futzed with underhood wiring in my daze..
  Oil and copper wiring make a mess that solder wont touch..no matter how
hot the iron.  The problem is the contamination is more than the rosin
flux in the solder can displace.  Acid flux will cut thru (and maybe some
non-acid fluxes) that contamination, but the acid remains in the solder
joint and becomes active when current is passed thru -eating the wires.
  This is why acid flux is a no-no around electrical connections.
  But the problem is not as severe on 12VDC systems as with house current.

  Solder should be avoided, but there are exceptions.  Lead does'nt take
well to vibration, and the heat of soldering is a consideration in the
life of a semiconductor.  Most devices are rated for 300'C for 10 
seconds without affecting design life due to soldering.  Rectifiers and
diodes are very robust in this area.

> Targa

	Refers to 911s which have a removable hard top and a large
roll-over hoop. It's halfway between a coupe and a convertible. May
have problems with wind noise and rain, but can give
wind-in-the-hair motoring.

> 911

	The "classic" Porsche, into its 31st year of production.

> Carrera

	Name originally given to the best/fastest 911 in the range (e.g.
1973 Carrera RS). Nowadays used for all 911s (since 1984). Usually
differentiated by engine size (Carrera 3.0, Carrera 3.2) or (1990
onwards) by number of driven wheels (Carrera 2 and Carrera 4). The
new (1994) 911 (also called 993) is just called Carrera to confuse
things!

	Also used for some fast 924s.

> Cabriole (sp)

	European name for a convertible.

> Coupe

	Hard-top non-removable roof. All current Porsches (except
cabriolets, Speedsters) are coupes.

I'm a member Florida Department of Law Enforcement ( similar to

The bottom line is common sense (IMO).
(The following is from memory)

1. If confronted by an armed attacker, give them the car.

2. If you have a remote alarm , use it only if you can get to a safe 
spot after the thief has the car.  But be sure he cannot return and harm you.

3.  If you think you are under attack, and can drive out of the 
situation, do it.  Do this even if your car has been bumped.  Go to the 
nearest police station or a well lighted area with lots of traffic. If you 
have a car phone use it.  

4. Keep the car locked and windows up when driving.

5. Avoid areas that seem unsafe.

BTW.  It is generally considered legal, under common law, to violate a 
law in your own self defense.  It comes down to judgement -- was 
what you did the least you could do to save yourself or another or did 
you overreact?   This is not a legal advisory or  the stated

I love the idea of a logo to be used on a patch or other display.

Some years ago I saw a print that really caught my eye and might be 
useful for a logo, if not too complicated.  Maybe some others say it, a 
reproduction of the famous Japanese print of a stormy sea and Mt. Fuji in 
the background.  The intereseting thing about this print was that on the 
left it was a faithful reproduction of the original print.  As you moved 
to the right the print slowly transformed itself into a wire grid 
representation of a stormy sea.  It looked very pretty and managed to 
combine a feeling of traditional craftsmanship and high tech evolution.  
Just the right image for PORSCHE, I think.

What about doing someting similar with the outline of a Porsche.  Of 
course we'd need to arm wrestle over 356 vs 911 vs 944 vs etc for the 
outline so maybe someother image would be better.

Well OK, $300 is for my driving record!  Of the remaining $1200, about 
$500-$700 or so is medical & injury related coverages.  MA has the 
highest accident rate in the nation (per capita, I think), due 
partially to "our" driving style and partially to very large fraud 
levels which are not policed well.

We also have been without a seatbelt law since 1986, until a couple 
months ago.  Belt usage is very low, contributing to additional 
injuries during all those accidents "we" seem to have!  So, it looks 
like other's failure to protect themselves *does* indeed cost me money!

On the other hand, cars that should be very expensive (red sports car, 
25 year old male) aren't too bad, because all insurance companies look 
at here before setting rate is (by law) vehicle class (i.e., value), 
driver(s) experience, driver(s) record/points, and place of garaging.  
Note that driver age or gender is *not* included!  There are discounts 
for driver's ed, alarms, low mileage, old age (!), air bags, etc.

My worthless, 1986 VW Golf II costs $600+ without collision, but with 
$89 for fire/theft/vandalism.  That's $500+ for medical / liability!

I agree that timing belt replacement can be painful if not a rip-off.
However, I question the wisdom of replacing the timing belt alone without
thoroughly assessing the condition of the idlers, water pump etc which can
be contribute  to belt failure.  For instance, I understand that the lower
compression ratio of my 951 is a blessing if belt failure occurs because
there is still sufficient clearance betwee valves and pistons to prevent
collision, at least I'm not wound up too tight.  However, I doubt that the
higher compression, normally aspirated 944s is so blessed, and hence there
may be more reason for concern about minimum cost belt jobs.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my question about the stick
that doesn't like to go into 1st and 2nd when cold.

Here's a little more info and then a brief summary of people's 
responses:
 
Shifting does not make any noise other than a slightly louder shifting
sound that I am convinced I could get out of any stick that I forcibly
pushed like that. Putting it into a higher gear is easier, but doesn't
help getting it into the lower gear- it's still just as hard.
The clutch is only 6 months old, and it's been sitting probably
about two out of those six, so I don't think it's the clutch disk.

The only thing that helps seems to be about ten minutes of
driving it around. 

Bruce Anderson suggested using swepco gear lube, which I will probably
try first, since it's the cheapest fix. Matt Kwiecien suggested
replacing the bushings. The Maestro thought it might be just
cold trans fluid, as sychro going, or a slightly rusted clutch
disk if the engine hasn't been running for a while.

All very useful thoughts.
I'll give an update as soon as I get around to fixing the problem
(might be a while).

Thanks!

My policy with Allstate for a '78 911 SC Targa runs $400 per year.  
That includes a $500 ded for collision, $150 for comp.  It's also the 
third car on the policy, low mileage driver, married over 25 category 
with homeowners policy also with the same agent.

Having seen much higher rates come across the net, I got a little 
worried about my coverage, so I called my agent.  The way that Allstate 
works is that they'll add a p-car to an existing preferred customer 
policy, but to walk off the street, they'd charge you 2-3 times as much 
if you were a new customer, or not insure you at all.

As far as replacement, they cover 'actual cash value', which is 
determined by an outside agency.  I could get 'stated cash value' at 
twice the cost, but they'd still look at what the current market value 
would be regardless of the stated value.  I don't know if they have a 
guaranteed replacement policy.

For those of you paying > $1000K per year, how does your coverage 
differ?  Will your company guarantee to replace the car?

I'll do my best, though some of the information may be in the 
close-but-no-cigar category.  Some of this is already in the group's FAQ (e.g.,
'what's a 911'), but some of the rest should probably find its way in there.

I'm going to take them out-of-order:
>	911

Porsche has made lots of cars over the years (well, not lots, but...), but 
the largest production (I believe) has been for the 911 model.  The 911 has
a six cylendar horisontally opposed (some call this a 'pancake' or a 'boxer' 
vs. a cylendar arrangement of vee, straight, or some exotic layout) air cooled
engine.  The 911 was introduced in 1964 (the same year, incidentally, as the
Ford Mustang).

>	Targa

This term has only been officially applied (to my knowledge) to the Porsche
911 and 912.  The Targa (was this introduced in 1967?) has a wide, functional, 
brushed stainless steel roll bar as the 'B' pillar just behind the doors.
In more recent (and customized) models, the roll bar may be black or painted
some other color.  Between the windshield and the roll bar is a removable top.  
Before 1969, the back window was a plastic snap-in type; but starting in 1969, 
the back window became solid glass.

This configuration is often mistaken by newbies as having the 911T designation.
The 911T is, however, an engine and trim configuration and is orthogonal to 
whether the car is a Targa or a coupe (they didn't have cabriolets when they
had the 911T).

The name 'Targa', incidentally, comes from the Italian 'Targa Fiorio' (sp?) 
race.

>	Carrera

This term has been used by Porsche to refer to their hopped-up models (until
1984, the term was used, I believe, for the MOST hopped-up version of a 
particular model -- this info may be a little off).  I know the term was 
applied to some very early machines (e.g., the Abarth Carrera) as well as 
forms of the 911 model.  For 911s, Carrera was introduced in 1973 for the 
Carrera RS.  It has carried through the 'Turbo Carrera' to the Carrera 2 and
Carrera 4.

This term, incidentally, comes from the Mexican race 'Carrera Panamerica' (or
is it the 'Carrera Panamericana'?).

>	Cabriole (sp)

A cabriolet is just a German word for 'convertible' (is this the literal
translation?).  This is distinguished, in the 911 model, from the Targa in that 
the cabriolet does not have a roll bar or back window.  The 356 models had a 
cabriolet as early as the 356A, though this form wasn't introduced into the 
911 until the early 1980's.

The 356 and the 911 both have an alternative form of convertible called the
'Speedster'.

>	Coupe

A coupe is just a car with a fixed top.  This is what you have if it's not
a Targa or cabriolet (although, I don't think the speedster comes with the
'cabriolet' designation even though it is a convertible).

Hope this helps.

I'd like raise any comments on the following:

I could be wrong here, but in CA, I heard they made it illegal for insurance 
companies to charge based on driver age (the 25 year thing). It was age 
discrimination.

Great! ...

So, now they charge based on years driving experience. And the magic 
number happens to be .... 25-16 ... NINE! (16 being the time when most 
start driving). But, for those who didn't get the license til they were 
18, its a bummer.

On the subject of insurance, we are 'bay area', and insurance is 
$1287 a year for both the '84 944 and '72 914.  Both cars have $250
deductible on both comp and collision, 100/300 M bodily injury, 50 M on
property, $5k on medical per person, 25/50 M uninsured motorist (each
person, each accident), which includes under-insured motorists.  And 
towing for the 914.  Add $8 for the towing just added to the 944.

No student discounts for adults, CA charges $1 per car "claim assessment fee",
944 gets an anti-theft discount, good driver discount, and a multi-car
discount (no other cars).  The California insurance board refuses to 
discount our rates further (as other states will) based on Paul's job.  

Perhaps we are over-insured, but when you live where idiots drive
without brakes and kill people, run stop signs and red lights, tailgate,
drive between lanes, and speed...... you also have to consider that a 
broken leg will cost you $30k here (trust me; been there, done that) and 
a day in a hospital room (semi-private) is over $1100. 

And as for problems being followed to your car, my initiation to California
was in Menlo Park with a guy trying to keep me from closing the car door
when I had my two year old daughter with me.  Solution:  talked him out
of it.  I have no idea how long it took because I blocked it from memory
for several days from shock.  He could have had the _car_, but not my
_daughter_.

   There was a guy with this type of setup at the POC race in Phoenix.
Yes, it looked nice.  The only problem was that, for all intents and 

purposes, the car is really good for nothing more than going in a
straight line in a hurry.  The guy was attempting to sell the car and
admitted this to be the case.  It was pretty nice with all that 

braided hose and chrome though...

Unless there is a *significant* amount of
reinforcement added to the tub, I'd be concerned about having the rear
of the car separating itself from the front due to all the twisting
from the engine's torque, not to mention weight.  Put some monster fender
flares on the back to accomodate some tires to handle the engine and
it might make a pretty fast drag racer if nothing else...

BTW: What do they use for a transmission/axle in these conversions?

Johnny,

From your description, sounds like there are two possible sources.  There
is a radial oil seal behind the pulley, and if it is what is leaking,
good news because it's easy to replace.  Otherwise, there's an o-ring
in a machined groove on the nose pulley.  You have to split the case

Subject: 356 Drag Coefficients, Part 2





TO: Porschephiles:

From: MAESTRO132@aol.com

Subject: Drag Coefficient, Efficiency, Part 2 



       ===========>        PART 2     <===========







     Now then, gentle reader, let us calculate just how much

Power is required to run your 356 down the road at say,

60MPH! And the Energy it takes for you to make the trip. The

formula for  aerodynamic drag force is:



          F(drag) = Cd(A)(p)V**2



where A is the frontal cross sectional Area

      p is the density of air (I don't have a rho on my keyboard)

      V is the Velocity

and"  Cd is the drag coefficient= 0.365 for a 356 A

                                = 0.398 for a 356 B

                           (and About 0.5 for a Buick)



 (These figures are from an article in "Christorphoros", the

Factory  publication and seem a bit high- most all the other

sources of drag coefficient for a 356 indicate it to be

about 0.32. However, it IS possible that the Factory's drag

coefficient also includes other, non-aerodynamic drag. So,

we'll use it as such- then compare it with the Road and

Track Tapley Data to see what we shall see.)



          In the above equation,



A is the frontal area of the car= (they said 17.3 square feet for

                                       either the 356 A or 356B



p is the density of air         = 0.08 pounds per cubic foot



V is the velocity of the car    = 88 feet per second (60MPH)



So, plugging into the equation we get:



F(drag) = (.365)(17.3ft**2)(0.08lb/ft**3)(88**2)ft**2/sec**2



or:

          F(drag) = 3912 lb-mass-ft/sec**2 



           Whose units are a little strange. 



     However, dividing by the Universal Fudge Factor or the

"gravitational constant", gc:



gc= 32.2 lb-mass/lb-force ft/sec**2, 

 

  one gets:



          F(drag) = 121.5 lb-force!



So, the drag force on the 356 at 60 MPH is about 120 pounds

or so. (This can be compared directly with the "Tapley" data

that Road and Track used to put out with their road tests-

they would plot the speed-time curve while COASTING down

from high speed. The SLOPE of the Speed-time curve gives the

retarding force. R&T gave Tapley data for 356 A and B's- and

it varied from 90-120 pounds. So, you can see, gentle reader

that the above calculation is VERY close, and somewhat on

the high side!!!



     O.K., so we have a drag force of some 120 lb-force. How

much POWER is required to move the car down the road. Well,

Force times velocity is Power, to wit:



          P = F*V



          P = (120 lb-force)*(88 ft/sec) = 10,560 ft-lbforce/sec



Since one horsepower is, by definition, 550 ft-lbforce/sec,

the horsepower required to move our 356 down the road at 60

MPH is:



             10,560 ft-lbforce/sec

          P= ----------------------

               550 ft-lbforce/sec/hp



or:       P= 19.2 Horsepower at 60 miles per hour.



     Now, as given in the Porsche Factory Manual, the

thermodynamic Efficiency (Fuel Consumption per

Horsepower-hr) of the 356 1600S engine at 60 MPH (3000 RPM

in fourth gear- with a "C" fourth gear) is some 8 ounces of

fuel per horsepower-hp. Or, about 0.5 a pound of fuel per

horsepower hour. Since we require some 19.2 HP to move the

car down the road at 60 MPH (let's be a pessimist and say 20

hp are required), some (20) X (0.5)= 10 pounds of fuel are

required per hour to run us down the road at 60 MPH. Since

the density of gasoline as given in the previous table is

some 6.152 pounds per gallon, the number of gallons required

per hour is:



          Gallons = 10 pounds/6.152 lb/gal = 1.62 gallons.



     Since we went 60 miles in that hour, our CALCULATED

fuel mileage is some 60/1.62 = 37 MPG!!! Not too shabby!!!

And that's WITH bumpers!!! And that, gentle reader, is what

you CAN get in your 356. 



     You probably DON'T get 37 MPG because the efficiency

curves given in the  Factory Manual are for FULL LOAD/FULL

THROTTLE conditions, which you usually don't have at 60 MPH

(If you DO, there's something wrong!!!). The Full Load

figure have a higher efficiency because the carb throttle is

wide open and the "pumping" loss across the throttle plate

is at a minimum. Thus, the efficiency of the engine during

the Factory's test is at a maximum.



       Using the Tapley data from Road and Track of 100

pounds  (versus the 120 used here), your theoretical gas

mileage would be some 45 MPG. 



     So depending on when you washed and waxed the car last

(reduced  aerodynamic drag, you know), your mileage may

vary! As they say. 



 ==============>   END OF EXCERPT  <===============



The Story goes on to explain a little elementary

Thermodynamics, showing the 356 Engine to be  25.5%

Efficient, which isn't bad, considering,  shows how

Compression Ratio affects Efficiency, compares the 356

Efficiency with Central Station Power Plants, Solar

Collectors and Ocean Temperature  Difference Power Plants,

and shows that the 356 Engine beats the  Thermodynamic pants

off two of the three.

One addition to what Chris Crowe said:  C2s are rear-wheel drive, C4s are
four-wheel drive.

One correction (sure to start an argument):  for a long time, (starting in 1977)
perhaps even to the present day, Porsche considered the 928 to be their
"flagship."  As Ernst Fuhrmann of Porsche said at the time of the 928's
introduction: "...the proven 911 is supplemented by the 928, above, and the
smaller 924 below."  To quote from "Porsche: Excellence was Expected" (p. 851):
"It was the newer concept ... that eventually would prevail.  That was no
reflection on the 911, or indeed on any previous Porsche.  Each was excellent in
its own time.  But the 928 was built to surpass them all, and met that ambitious
goal."

On comment: why anyone thinks there has to be a single "true Porsche" is beyond
me.

(Hopefully, there's nothing wrong with posting it here.)

             FUELS, FOOLS AND OTHER CHARLATANS







     The Scene: Early Sunday morning. The Maestro is headed

North on 280 towards The City on yet another Episode.

Again, the AM/FM/SW Blaupunkt Radio in his soon to be

defunct (in a Major Way), 1960 Mercedes 220 S was on "FM".



     Having sampled the Sunday Faire and found it Wanting,

he picked what proved to be the Most Interesting

Conversation With A Turkey. For, it was a "hippy-type" (how

could he tell on the RADIO? Simple. Count the number of "you

know's" per minute. If greater than 10, chances are 98% it's

a hippy- by definition!) expousing on the wonders of his

pig-excrement, alcohol fueled pick-um-up truck. And here is

part of what the Maestro heard:



          Announcer: "Tell me- and our radio audience- about

that "interesting experience" you had getting to our

studios! This is pretty funny!



          Hippy Guest:"Heh, heh, yuk, yuk"- Sure, be glad

to. It SURE was funny! Man, like you know. Heh,...heh. Uh,

lets see- Ah was a comin' from mah fahm through the San

Jouckin' Valley, you know, when Ah realized that Ah was, you

know, a bit low on gas...uh... alcohol, that is. So, you

know, Ah a-pulled into a gas-o-line station down the road a

piece, you know.



          Announcer (interrupting): "And tell us what you

did then?"



          Hippy Guest (Energy Expert) : "Yeah, you know Ah

was a gettin' to that. Anyway, Ah a-drives up to the pump,

you know, and a-gets out and like grabs the WATER hose, you

know. Ah then preceded to put the WATER HOSE into the gas

tank inlet. The gas station attendant- why he see that and

he just FREAKS OUT, MAN, like you know? Ah mean he just went

LOCO! YOU KNOW? WHAT YO' DOIN' MAN, he says! Ah'm a fuelin'

up says I. WITH WATER???!!! Says he. YEP, says I. And Ah

added a few gallons of water to the alcohol left in mah

tank, and, you know, Con-tinued on mah way!!!



          Announcer: (Excitedly) "And you MADE it here, of

course?



          Hippy Guest: "Shoot, you see me don'tcha. Ah got

here in the free energy in the water- just like YOU can!

With one o' mah Alcohol Distillation Kits!



     Upon hearing the above conversation, the Maestro Analog

Analyzer that he carries with him in his head went: 



     PRIORITY INTERRUPT!!! PRIORITY INTERRUPT!!! BEEP, BEEP,

BEEP- VIOLATION OF THERMODYNAMICS ALERT!!!

FRAUD/RIPOFF/IDIOT/TURKEY ALERT!!! GRADUATE OF THE

CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM ALERT!!! 



     All the bells and whistles went off at once. WHO IS

this Big Dummy anyway? thought the Maestro. WHY is he

allowed to speak his Thermodynamic Blasphemy on the Public

Airwaves??? Come ON announcer- ask the turkey the Obvious

question- ifin adding water to the "alcohol" tank allowed

him to go further, then why the HELL Doesn't he use that

technique ALL THE TIME!!! Instead of just during

"emergencies"??? 



     But, alas, the announcer was ALSO a graduate of the

California Public School System and could not even THINK of

the Obvious Question. And as for Thermodynamics, neither one

had the foggiest idea! So, gentle reader, in case YOU want

to know WHAT's REALLY going on Out There in the Fuel Fools

School, let the Maestro lead you through what gas mileage

REALLY is and what you can expect from your Porsche!!! As

well as a Few Other things.



(Stuff left out.)       But, I digress. THE Most Important

parameter of a "Fuel" is its Energy Content. To show you

what's going on, the Maestro has constructed a Chart

comparing the Energy Content of three fuels- Methyl Alcohol,

Ethyl alcohol and that Old Time Favorite- Gasoline:



====================================================================

COMPOUND         HEAT OF COMBUSTION       DENSITY   AIR/FUEL RATIO

                 BTU/POUND   BTU/GALLON   LB/GAL    LB AIR/LB FUEL

===================================================================

GASOLINE         20,750      127,600      6.152     15.11



ETHYL ALCOHOL    12,830       84,500      6.59      9



METHYL ALCOHOL    9,620       64,000      6.65      6.46

===================================================================





     Thus, from the above table, one can see that per GALLON

of fuel, ethyl alcohol has but 84,500/127,600 = 0.66 the

heat content of gasoline. That is, ethyl alcohol has only

about 2/3 the energy of gasoline per gallon!



     Per pound, ethyl alcohol is even worse- having only

about 62% of the heat content of gasoline. Thus, gentle

reader, you can immediately see that all things being equal,

alcohol will only give you 2/3 of the mileage of gasoline. 



     So, if you got 30 MPG with gasoline BEFORE you changed

to Alcohol, you can get only 20 MPG with Alcohol- ETHYL

Alcohol that is. (Methyl is even worse!) 



     MORALE: Gasoline stores a HELL of a lot of energy!!!

Remember that the next time you check the fuel level in your

A/early B fuel tank with a lit match!

A p-philes logo, etc. sounds great.  Are there any artists in the group
who'd be willing to design one?  (The height of my artistic career ended
when my Etch-a-sketch broke...I'm definitely not qualified).

Maybe Stan and Drew would like the honors of judging submissions?  Or, maybe

Hi, Bill and Phillip.
 
Le Mans has some noteworthy non-car attractions. The cathedral is OK (but
nothing compared to Chartres just down the road, or Reims on the other side
of Paris).
 
I found a little restaurant there, a local rather than touristy place if you
catch the distinction, named La Rascasse. I think they close at 10. Food was
great and reasonable. It's at 6, Rue de la Mission, tel. 43 84 45 91. (Is
the 43 an area code?)
 
The Porsche Club of America/Germany Region usually stakes out a camping area
in Camping du Houx, in the infield. They bring an Army tent and some
Armyburgers and some cut-open oil drums to serve as barbecues and everybody
has a great time. Most PCAers get the tickets that let you go into the
"Tribune Welcome" area to catch the start and finish, it's the grassy area
at the pit exit.
 
For the past 3 visits to Le Mans, I have been staying with a family in
Teloche, where the Porsche factory team used to set up base. Teloche is just
off the Hunaudieres straight (sometimes called the Mulsanne straight).

Subject: Message to George Buselnick, about relays85/2 944

George this is Sam, i ordered a cooling fan relay from you about a month ago
for my 85/2 944, the one you sent my was part #944.615.104.01, and you said
you checked it out which Im sure you did,and Im sure it works,. however after
installing the relay back then the problem persisted , I did change the fan
switch before the relay, just so you know, OK, you suggested replacing the 
switch again so with a known good one I replaced the already new switch in my
car,  the same problem.
 so today I was goofing around trying to figure out what was wrong with the
cooling system (because my coolant has been boiling off regularly because the
fans dont stay on after the car's shut off) I replaced the relay I got from
you with the old relay, and now the fans cycle on and off after the cars shut
down, ,, I compared the two relays and they  have the same footprint but they
are different sizes in height, and width , mine is part # 944.614.104.02, a
different part, all together although Im sure it has been superceeded or
something like that, I even tried a brand new one from  my mechanic and it
didnt work so there must be something different in these relays , at anyrate
the only thing the one I got from you doesnt do is turn on the fans when the
car is off, perhaps it would work in a later car, if youd like I can send the
relay back to you and you can check it out to see if it works, if so perhaps
you can give me some credit or something, by the way, Ill send you a good
thermofan switch too if you think you can use it ,

Subject: any use/value of these items...

Hi gang,

In preparation for a long drive and then parting with the 944, several
items have been uncovered that leave us questioning "any value" or
"what do we do with this".  

I know that the proper thing to be included in selling the 944 is the
packet of information in owners manual, including the warranty & maintenance
book, and the pamphlet about the radio.  However, we also have Hayne's,
the workshop manuals (2 volumes), and the pamphlets issued by Porsche
about the 944 (booklets about 10" by 11", grey, red, rose).  Also sitting
around outside is the 'spare' Michelin XGTV 205/55/VR16 with about 3k
miles on it (from left rear when right rear had nail in sidewall and
tires were unavailable).  

Also sitting around is the booklet for the Porsche 911 Carrera and turbo
(10" by 11", grey).

Also, sitting in our mechanic's garage 2500 miles from here are the 
original wheels from the car ('84).  

So, stuff to toss in the trash, or do we pass along as much as possible
to some dealer and let them do what they want with the material?

Also, in a trade-in situation, what is the best thing to do with the
repair file?  Since the speedo was replaced, I would think that needs
to be included.  But does a big stack of repair receipts hurt the 
negotiation standpoint?  We want to lease a family car, buy a commuter
car.  944 needs to become the 'down-payment'.

Consider that it costs at least .50 per pound to ship this stuff (our
money).

You may want to reply directly to us since this may not be of interest
to others on the mailer.

Thanks,
Pam       collopy@leland.stanford.edu

Subject: 356 aerodynamics

As usual Pellow is doing his imitation of a Klein bottle, and sticking his
head where solar cells won't work. After the misinformation presented by
this self-proclaimed wizard regarding exploding fans, low-compression
engines with bottom-end torque that outperform factory motors at the top end
too (but only in his mind, not in a head-to-head test, for which he feels the
need to build a cheater engine), he's trying to bullshit his way into a
discussion of aerodynamics with the same methods -- numerical fairy tales.
 
>Factory  publication and seem a bit high- most all the other

>about 0.32. However, it IS possible that the Factory's drag
>coefficient also includes other, non-aerodynamic drag. So,
>we'll use it as such
 
No. Other drag components cannot be combined with aero drag. It just plain
doesn't work that way. Aero drag is related to the square of velocity, rolling
and other frictional losses are directly proportional to velocity and therefore
cannot be combined to give an aggregate Cd. If Pellow knew any aerodynamics
he wouldn't make that assumption -- or that mistake.
 
>then compare it with the Road and
>Track Tapley Data to see what we shall see.
 
Pellow should call Road & Track to see if they're willing to sell him their old
Tapley meter. Does he even know what a Tapley meter is? I'll tell you: it's a
glass U-tube that attaches to the windshield by suction cups. When you
accelerate, the colored fluid in the tube rises in proportion to the
acceleration (ignoring chassis squat and road grade). Decades ago, this Rube
Goldberg thing was replaced by a fifth wheel system for measuring acceleration
and braking performance, but R&T still has it, sitting in a steel cabinet with
other disused junk. R&T stopped using it nearly three decades ago; today it's
regarded as a curiosity, if not a joke, to share with visitors, just like the
Cyclops car in the lobby. How do I know this? Because I left Porsche's R&D
department in Weissach to take the position of R&T's engineering editor. The
test equipment which Pellow is afraid to face with the same engines he sells
to customers was originally delivered to R&T. They couldn't afford it, I
could, I bought it when I set up my own consulting business.
 
Anyway, Tapley data is next to useless and is today's equivalent of using a
Vericom or g-analyst to get precision drag strip data. Or building your own
g-meter using a swinging pendulum attached to a potentiometer. It's not
acceptable from an engineering standpoint. It doesn't even belong in any
discussion of drag if that discussion is to have any engineering validity.

Pellow's mpg calculations are shoddy. On page T6 of the 356 B repair manual
(German edition) the minimum bsfc (brake specific fuel consumption) of a 75 hp
1600 S engine is given as 245 g/hp-hr at 3700 rpm.
1) This is not considered very good these days.
The magic number for engine designers is about 200 g/hp-hr.
2) 245 grams is .540 lb, 8 percent different from .5 lb. Calculated fuel
economy will be 8 percent off too, which is significant. 8 pct of 37 is
nearly 3 mpg. Just as Pellow's engine number/date stamp curve fits
have equations with 12-significant-figure coefficients for data that by his
admission has typical errors of 30 weeks or more, and therefore justify
three sig figs at best, he apparently doesn't grasp the basic concept of
significant figures, something that high school freshman are taught in the
first week of their physics class.
3) This is BRAKE specific fuel consumption, measured on a dyno at the
crankshaft, and does not come anywhere near taking into account the very
significant losses through the drivetrain and due to aero drag.
4) As Pellow himself points out, this is at wide open throttle. BSFC will
increase not just a little bit but by a large amount at part throttle. I don't
have a consumption map of the 356 available, but for comparison the new Type
993 has a bsfc of less than 250 g/kW-hr, or in units consistent with this
discussion, 190 g/hp-hr -- amazing for current engines. If the engine is
operated at part throttle, to deliver about 20 hp at 3000 rpm for this
discussion, bsfc jumps up to nearly 500 g/kw-hr -- nearly double the best wide
open throttle bsfc. Therefore, in this case as well as for any conventional Otto
 -cycle engine, miles-per-gallon calculations using the bsfc data but assuming
part throttle operation go right out the window.
5) The factory 356 manual lists bsfc at 245 g/hp-hr at 3700, not 3000 rpm. It
is not valid to assume the part load consumption at 3000 rpm (57 mph with the
U.S. standard D gears, not C as Pellow states) is comparable to the full load
bsfc at 3700 rpm, which corresponds to 70 mph with U.S. "D" gearing and 74
with rest-of-world "C" gears. Transferring the wrong data from 3700 to 3000
rpm is just as wrong as transferring data from full load to part load
operation.
6) A much more valid number for actual fuel economy is already in the repair
manual, just two inches below where Pellow's brain apparently stopped. Measured
fuel economy is given as 8.2 liters/100 km, or 28.6 mpg for a Super, and
8.5 l/100 km or 27.7 mpg for a Normal engine. Once again, Pellow would rather
let his fingers do the walking on the calculator, rather than actually go out
and measure things, or use actual test results. This sort of "analysis"
gives us 100 mile-per-gallon Cadillacs if you add up all the mpg claims for
aftermarket devices in the J.C. Whitney catalog.
 
Just in case anybody is still interested in real data, the new 911 (Type 993)
has a Cd of 0.330, a frontal area of 1.860 m**2 (20.0 ft**2). Front lift
coefficient Clf is -0.03; rear lift coefficient Clr = -0.07. Measured fuel
consumption is 31.8 mpg at 90 km/h (56 mpg) and 25.8 mpg at 120 km/h
(74.6 mph). (Reported in Automobiltechnische Zeitschrift, Vol. 95 #10 & #11).

Subject: engine noise

Today I started hearing an intermittent noise that I initially attributed 
to a suspension or brake noise.  It's a clacking sound, that after 
stopping, and opening the engine cover, is coming from somewhere in the 
engine area, possibly near the distributor.  It doesn't seem related to 
rpm's, although at this time, I've only heard the sound in the engine at 
idle time.

I haven't noticed any loss of power but am worried about the noise.  Does 
anyone have suggestions on possible simple causes?  I did have to put the 
airbox back on, but this was not the cause, as with the airbox affixed 
tighly the intermittent (once every 20-30 seconds at idle time) clack 
still occurs, somewhere around the distributor or inside the engine.  
Engine is '78 SC 3.0l with about 150K.

Subject: Removing decals

Removing decals on cars can be fairly easy if you are careful.

Wait for a warm sunny day when the car gets nice and hot. 
Get a hair dryer and warm up the decal area.....be careful
not to harm the paint!!!

When the temperature gets high enough the decal glue
gets very soft and you can just peel it off.  Be careful not
to scratch the paint.
This also works well with the stick-on badges.
This process only works well on resonably new stickers for 
a couple of reasons........
 1. The adhesive gets tougher over time
  2.  Removing decals on old paint reveals the original
       un-sunbleached paint color.

I am sure there are other ways......but this has worked for me.
Good luck!

Hi all,

Again, (second consecutive) my weekend became a greasy, smelly thing, 
abrupted by a few but noteable calls to the allmighty.
I'll take the change you'll swallow my excuses, and continue the story even 
if it is not a real Porsche story.(.......flame me to death, the additional 
heat would only make the spring come faster here north!? :) :)

This weekend I was off to assist a lady and her broken down, otherwise 'mint'
 condition '67 VW type 113 de luxe. This was of course a beetle. 'The' 
sixties beetle many VW freaks would say. 

It was the quality and charm of these cars that first made me interested, 
gathered knowledge, and got to know the story and work of the man that was 
second most important to the Volskwagen project. Dr. Porsche, that is.
                                                         ____

200 miles.........................()=()=()=\-O------------O\


When I got to fire the engine of 'Augusta' the beetle, it puffed and sounded 
very unhealthy, and the fumes coming out of every opening in the crankcase 
made me very suspect there could be some 'loss of compression' at given places.
Being not unfamiliar with these engines, I had a clue, at least i hoped i 
had one.(the magic cylinder number three...!?)

Lowering the engine, taking it apart, off with the head, and yes, cylinder 
number three, or more concrete piston number three; cracked and destroyed in 
the lower parts of the piston. The standard pre 71 beetle engine failure.

This engine was put in the actual beetle some three years ago by me. It was 
tuned and boosted about 80DIN Hp. The failure came due to excessive heat, or 
as the lady told me "I saw the oil lamp blinking in the bends, but there 
were no place to get oil, so I had to preceed home".......(and kill the 
engine).....! Well, just what i was looking for, a 70 beetle case.(Why,...? 
That's another story.)

But 'Augusta' didn't seem to happy,....until I uncovered her old engine. The 
1500 cc correct numbers engine that I had put away for restoration once in 
the future. Matching # you know.......! This little engine gave 44Hp and was 
not adrenalin cooking, but a steady little powerplant it is. In with the 
'old' engine and voila, 'Augusta' the beetle purrs like a kitten. (Another 
lady purred like a kitten too,............but that's definitely another 
story!!) 
The engine had been oiled, and 'sealed' in plastic, and on the 3 revolution 
of crank the da*** thing fired!!! With the right ignition setting, fuel in 
the carb, and some compression left these engines are fabolous!

Hope I didn't bore you to death, but this 'classic' air cooled boxer failure 
was to tempting to share with you.....!!!

cheers,

I had to replace the "Carrara" emblem on my car a while back. I don't know if
your decal is glued in the same manner.

I used blow dryer to soften the glue and then slowly peeled the emblem off. I
then cleaned the remaining glue off with BASF's Pre-kleano wax and silicone
remover (there are other brands that would work just as well). 

Obviously, you will need to re-wax the area.

Hope this helps.

    Well, this one has been discussed a few times.  The opinion of the
PorschePhiles mainstream is:  Yuck!
    With a V8 conversion, you wind up with *lots* of extra weight, in a
car that was not really designed to deal with it.  It is also distributed
differently from the original design, and you have to chop holes in your
baby for the cooling system.  Someone also said that it was phenomenally
ugly from a *design* standpoint.
    You can cope with the weight (somewhat), but it starts to get expen-
sive.  Chassis reinforcements, heavy-duty springs, 911 front suspension
(with 911 brakes!) big flares for the wider tires needed, etc.  The thing
is, even if you do that, you are working counter to one of the main pur-
poses of the 914 design:  light weight for high maneuverability.
    A different solution is to find a 911 motor to put into the thing.
The car was designed to take it, it's light, no extra cooling stuff needed,
etc....  Although we're talking pretty serious bucks, again....

    The V8 guys claim that you can keep the stock tranny up to 300HP.  But
I wouldn't use first gear in one of those!

Some where in the dim past I acquired a conversion kit for a small block chevy
V8. It uses the 911 gear box clutch and pressure plate with a new flywheel.
Also included were two chrome exhaust manifolds. The placement of the radiator
up front seems to be one of the main problems. The engine combination is
heavier; I was told it was necessary to put 150lbs of steel as far forward as
possible to balance it out. As has been said; I was told one hell of a car in
a straight line.

Any one interested in the kit?

The other favourite I belive is an aluminum 2.8 V6 Buick engine.

No H20

911s are air *and* oil colled so most higher-output versions
do use a radiator to help cool the oil.

Porsche will probably go to a hybrid air/water cooling system
in the future - necessary for 4 valve heads and to make the
engines quieter :-(

Air cooling is good for a number of reasons.

Simplicity, fewer moving parts, lower weight, faster warm-up,
greater MTBF, no freezing, etc. The amount of air pumped over 
the 911 engine at crusing speed is in the tons per hour range 
I think, I expect someone on the list has the exact facts and figures 
at hand ;-)

Air cooling also makes the engine useful for other purposes, and
I have heard of it being used in aircraft and airships. I think
the germans may call the flat six boxer a `flugelmotor' (sp?).
I don't have any references to confirm this though.

The other fine feature of the air-cooled flat six is the delightful
rumbling with a rushing, whining sound that turns into an
abrasive, and to my ears tuneful howl as you hit the power
(around 4200 rpm in the 3.2 Carrera). Aural sex!

    I've always heard the autocrossers telling the rest of us,

movie.  *Someone* even suggested that it attracted women.  (Well,
specifically one *very* cute one.  ;-)
    Well, this weekend I finally gave in.  I attended the "last
waltz" up at the Redwood Region's Sonoma County Airport site.
My mind still seems to be kinda fragmented, BUT:
    First, I rode the course with Soren.  I'd ridden with him on
the street, and he's pushed it once or twice when he had the 
sticky tires on, but this was a whole order of magnitude more.
He was trying to tell me about the line he was driving (or, in
some cases, should have been driving ;-) but all I could think of
was hanging on even tighter!
    It was a lot better when I actually had some control over the
car.  I said *some*!  I spun in my proctice lap on the second run.
I wasn't alone in spinning, thank Ferry, but I was the first.  I
did all four morning runs, but bailed out of the afternoon laps,
because I was worried about my oil light (later).  My times were
rather uninspired (another 74 2.0L 914 without swaybars was beat
me by about four seconds), but not too awful for a first-timer on
non-sticky tires.
    I had a great time.  Now I need a rev-limiting distributor
rotor (750 RPM over red-line!  Twice!!) and I'll put the 509s on
the car.  But I swear that I won't try to make the car "competi-
tive"!  (And I'll never drink again, and the check is in the mail,
and ....)
    So, after one autocross, there's just one thing for me to say:
"Come, join with us--you'll like it...."

You can build a VW to 100+ HP but no matter what you do to the oil pump/oil
cooler/fan/shroud, those tiny little heads just can't disipate the heat in
the way required to make the thing last.  Was the motor you built running

Subject: Air-cooled Engines

Air-cooled Engines
    Well, nobody else has tackled this one yet, so....

Someone asked about the difference between air-cooled and water-
cooled engines.  If they require a different kind of radiator, etc.
    Specifically, the 911 engine can be (simplistically) viewed as
one and a half VW Bug engines welded together on mega-steroids.
(In the same way that a big-block V8 can be viewed as two Honda
fours welded together on steroids.)
    Air-cooled is something of a mis-nomer.  The engines are actually
cooled by their oil.  No water at all in the engine to take the heat
away.  Instead, the oil is circulated through an oil cooler.  It's
kind of like a radiator, except it's for oil, not water.  The oil can
also be cooled when it's in the sump, or running through the lines,
but that's more detail than we need right now.
    Air-cooled engines run quite a bit hotter than most water-cooled
engines.  However, they are much lighter--no water, no water plumbing,
and oil coolers are generally quite a bit smaller and lighter than
water radiators.  They also tend to be louder, since the water seems
to absorbe some of the engine noise.
    For many people, they're an acquired taste.  I like 'em!

Hi, Jim.
 
I'm sorry you object to my posting to Pellow re aerodynamics, but let me
explain my position. Like you, I want car information too, and Pellow
doesn't provide it. It's one thing for a member of the Porschephiles to make
a mistake; he shouldn't expect to be flamed for it, and the whole function
of this forum is to provide a means of information exchange by which its
members can arrive at accurate information. But when somebody
creates an alterego named the maestro, and behaves like he has a monopoly on
356 fact, I feel those mistakes call for a healthy dose of napalm.
 
He has been posing as some sort of 356 guru for years,
with flawed information, and putting down everybody else in the field. By my
reply, I attempt to point out errors in what he claims to be engineering
fact. He makes serious errors in aerodynamics and in
applying engine fuel consumption data at full throttle to figuring out
economy at nearly-closed throttle, using sophomoric garbage-in/garbage-out
assumptions. If pointing out those errors, with
numbers included, is not real information, then what is? Most of his posting
is just plain wrong, and I feel somebody has to say that, and back it up
with numbers. Because he calls himself the maestro doesn't mean there's any
validity to what he says, and it's time the 356 community looked at his
stuff more critically.
 
Through his books and column in the 356 Registry,
Pellow has been flaming others in the 356 community for years. Now he's
getting back as well as he's given, because he's never before been
subjected to a forum where his mistakes can be pointed out to all the others
in the forum -- and where he can be publicly flamed/flamed back for the
mistakes he makes while on his "maestro" soapbox.
 
And there is little real information in that long excerpt
from one of his books, just a caricature of some "hippie" on the radio
and about three actual lines of data on the latent heat of different fuels..
That, to me, is real clutter on the net.
 
In the interest of correcting mistakes and providing real information,
I'm going to restrict myself to one flaming round per Pellow mistake. I
stopped replying to the top speed thing when it became clear that he was
building a cheater engine, and had no intention of running a customer engine
for which he made the initial claims which I challenged.
 
If I were being paid by the hour, I could make a living from pointing out
Pellow's errors.
 
Pete

I have a 1981 911SC Targa and when I bought it from the guy last year
he told me it was the European edition, and I think he said it was
called the Weissach edition, or something like that.

How do I know if its a Weissach?  More importantly, what exactly does 
this mean?  I took it to a Porsche mechanic, and he told me it was some 
sort of European model too, he said basically it had a little more 
horsepower.  Is there a european model and also a weissach model of
the early 80's 911?

Some of my cars features, that might help someone help me out...
It is a Targa, has the front spoiler under the bumper and has factory
fog lights attached to the valance/spoiler under this front bumper,
and has one red fog light in the rear, atached on the drivers side 
only, just below the bumper, near the exhaust outlet.  Power windows,
heated mirrors both sides (electric position adjust only on drivers side),
leather interior, rubber shift boot, it has a climate control system (not
AC) which has a dial on the center console that turns to numbers 1-9.
When the knob turns, there is a lever next to the emergency brake
handle that automatically raises to a certain point  to adjust the temperature.
There is a sensor for how hot the cabin is up near the rear-view mirror.
This heating system is unfunctional, because the air pump/fan was removed
from the engine compartment to give the car more power (before I bought it)
It also has a rear window defogger.  No AC, no cruise.  It has a whaletail.
It has working side side lights on the sides of the car, just behind the
front wheels, on the front quarter panels.

I was told by someone, sometime that these are extras only on some
special models.  Are these "Weissach" extras.  Is there something about
my car that I can look at and say "yep, its a weissach."?

The Vehicle ID #, from the dashboard, under the windshield, in the corner is:
91A0131470      
My insurance compnay told me that this does not match a Porsche VID (or
is it VIN) number.  Does anyone know anything about this.

Subject: Unpaid testimonial


Dear Porschephiles, 

My good friend Miq Millman told me about a 
recent controversy in this group, and Miq forwarded me a partial 
transcript of the discussion because he knew I had a Harry Pellow
motor in my 356. 

I thought I could add a data point or two to the discussion. 
Here's a rundown on the vital statistics on my motor:

Industrial Engine std bore case (purchased from Harry)
normal heads - with ports opened up to S-90 ovoid shape
std/std normal crank 
maestromaster cam
big bore (1750cc) pistons - whatever brand Harry used in 1991
weber 40IDF carbs
Bosch 050 distributor

The whole car is a 1961 normal coupe - converted to 12V 
operation by me - I also added a new VDO oil pressure 
gauge. The engine uses a "narrow" 12V generator from 
a 912. 

I asked Harry to build me a motor that would last a long
time - performance was not to be a criterion - with the 
caveat that I should be able to drive the car reasonably. 
I believe the compression on the engine is about 7 to 7.5 to 1. 
I keep the engine tuned to manufacturer's specs as far as 
ignition timing et al is concerned. 

After three years and about 20,000 miles, I'm pleased with 
this engine. I can take the car to 100MPH and 4500 RPM (redline
for a normal) quite easily, and have done so on lonely
interstate highways when no one else was around. The engine
felt as though it would have gone higher, but I didn't want to 
exceed the place where Ferry Porsche said that engine was supposed
to go. The engine makes great oil pressure, pulls well in the 
low end, and I have no regrets about purchasing it. 

I had trouble once with a valve binding in the guide, but this
was due to my own error - an independent shop confirmed that the
clearance was right where the book said it should be. (My own 
lame-brain idea of mixing nifty super gasoline gummed up the 
works...) 

Anyway, for what it's worth - I do believe that a standard 
maestromassaged street motor could hit 120 MPH and 6K RPM on a
flat straight road. 

Note that I have no other relationship with Harry other than 
as a satisfied customer and he didn't ask me to post this. I
do not subscribe to this list, and I saw the discussion 
tangentially, and I have not seen the whole discussion. Any 
replies should probably explicitly include my address on 
the distribution. I'd be more than happy to expand on my
comments if it is requested. 

Yours for clearing the air,

Jeff Zurschmeide

Subject: leaky gas tank '74 914


	Yesterday I finally had a chance to pull the gas tank out of 
my '74 914.  It has been leaking a bit of fuel whenever I have more then
1/4 tank of gas in the car.  Never alot of gas, but enough to smell,
and leave drip marks on the pavement.

	After I pulled the tank I found that one of the pads the keep the
tank from rubbing against the bulkhead (the rear one) had become wet.  Once
wet, it had accelerated the rusting process on the portion of the tank
it touched.  The tanks skin is now VERY thin, and leaks.  This is where
the gas was coming out.  

	I also noticed as I was pulling the tank out that the fuel
delivery line was kinked REALLY badly.  I expect that this may be
contributing to my starting problems with the car.

	I have two questions now:

	1) Is is possible/recommended to fix this tank?  The rusty area
is about 2 1/2" by 5".  It is very rusted there... The patch would have
to be very good to support the tank there, as not much metal is left. 
I do have another tank that I could swap in, so that isn't a big problem.
Comments/Suggestions?

	2) Should I move the fuel pump to the front now?  Everything is
accessable as the fuel tank is out and I have cleaned everything to
get rid of the smell.  There are a couple of issues to moving the
pump to the front.  The wiring must be moved, and the hard lines
through the passenger compartment will be subjected to high
pressure.  How hard is it to move the wiring?  What is the concensus
for the hard lines.  Should the hard lines be replaced?  I know
that Stan has recommended that they be replaced, but was that just
for race cars?  The other question I have is how should the pump be
mounted on in the front?

	Suggestions and comments appreciated, Alex

Subject: Re: 911 oil leak/smoke

My 71 911E produces copious clouds of blue smoke from time to time.
It occurs under three sets of circumstances:

1. At cold start time.  A mechanic friend assures me that this is normal
   because of the way that oil pools in the flat engine.

2. When I downshift and use the engine for a brake. Again, I am told that
   this is not too serious, it is common for worn engines (valve guides?).

3. After I park and shut off the engine. Oil drips down the front right-hand
   side of the engine onto the heater boxes, and exhaust pipes, and sizzles, 
   and smokes. Now *this* is worrisome - it could possibly lead to an 
   engine fire.

I just noticed that #3 is by far the worst if the oil level is topped off
or overfilled. Is it possible that oil is coming out of a breather vent
on top of the engine in this case?

 -Moral - be very careful about overfilling your oil.

Subject: Engine rebuild questions

I'm in the middle of completely rebuilding a '72 911E.  My first 
Porsche rebuild. I'm now reassembling the engine. Can anyone please 
help with these minor questions?

1) I'm using a thin coat of Locktite 574 on the cam tower to head joint.  
This is correct, isn't it?  No need to be so heavy it squishes out, is 
there?

2) I"ve done cylinders 1 2 3 so far.  The procedure I used was to put 
the heads on finger tight, and then torque down the cam tower, 
constantly checking for free cam rotation.  That part worked fine.  
Then I torqued the head nuts in a criss-cross pattern, in stages, 
starting in the middle, just like for an ordinary, one piece cylinder 
head.  Right near the end of the sequence, approaching about 20 ft-
lbs, tightening the middle head cause the cam to bind.  Loosening 
and then tightening in a different sequence allowed me to get it 
snugged down with the cam free enough to turn.  The problem is that 
although it turns, I don't think it's as free as it might be.   You have to 
twist it fairly hard to get it going, but once moving it's easy to turn 
with two fingers.  Is this OK?  I tend to think so, but would appreciate 
the benefit of someone else's experience since this is my first and I 
have none.

Thanks.

Has anyone had any experience with any of the "914 engine savers" available

Nope.  Nada.  Nein.  Natch.  You are incorrect, sir.

You can very easily make a VW engine put out 100+ HP without drastically (or
even minimally) shortening its working life.  The key to doing it, is doing it
intellegently.  Many VW hot-rodders try to get cheap HP by slapping on some
bigger pistons, hotter cam, and bigger carbs and then subsequently toast the
engine.  The key word to hopping-up VW engines (and 4-cylinder Porsche engines,
for that matter) is balance.  Every change you make to the engine must be met
with other changes that maintain the balance (weight, airflow, or otherwise).
It is fairly easy to build a 110 HP engine (enough power to make driving very
hairy in anything other than a Type III, due to aerodynamics), as long as you
think through your "design" and realize that every action has an equal, and
opposite reaction.  If you go with a hotter cam, you will need to strengthen
the valve train accordingly to deal with the added stresses (actually, this is
why high-ratio rockers are the modification of choice for many builders--all
the lift of a hot cam without the duration changes, or the steeper ramp angles).
Likewise with engine breathing--if you get bigger carbs, you better have a more
efficient exhaust, otherwise, there will be nowhere for the heat to go.  If you
are planning on turning higher RPM's, be prepared to improve breathing on the
heads/carbs/exhaust, as well as going with a *perfectly* balanced flywheel, 
rods, pistons, clutch, pulley, and *forged* counterweighted crankshaft.  After
all, weight differences cause friction, and friction causes heat.  Since you
want this engine to last, it's a good idea to go with forged pistons/cylinders,
rather than cheap cast ones--but all too often, people want to pay bottom 
dollar and buy the budget gourmet P&C sets.

If you properly match components, modify heads/rockers/carbs/exhaust, balance
the engine (to within less than 1 gram difference), and take your time and do
things right, you can easily build a 1600cc VW engine that will make just as
many HP as Porsche 356/912 engines (let's not mention Carreras, shall we), 
albeit with different torque characteristics (due to the different bore/stroke
characteristics of each engine).  These engines will last just as long, if not
longer than the Porsche engines.  However, they will be almost as expensive as
a Porsche motor--but then, as the saying goes:  "Speed costs money.  How fast
do you want to go?"

Barry,

I have no idea what the Weissach edition actually means but I have a
german sold '82 911 SC (no Weissach) and it has all the features you 
listed except for heated mirrors and leather interior. Leather could 
however be ordered as an option like the Fuchs 16" wheels.


What made me answer is the fact that the heat control does not work
because the air pump has been removed. This air pump is there to get
cleaner exhausts by adding air to the exhaust pipes. There is then 
a post-combustion which makes the exhausts cleaner.

I could of course be wrong, but I don't believe the air pump removal
has something to do with the non functional heat control unless 
the heat exchangers where changed in the process to exhaust pipes
without heat exchangers.

The temperature sensor has given me some problems due to bad contact
in the connector. The connector is the same as the extension cable
on the camera flashgun and when I made the connector to stay in place
the heat control works (we do actually need the heat sometimes).

Both true.

| How hard is it to move the wiring?  

The wiring is the easy part.  All you have to do is connect a wire to
the existing pump wire in the engine compartment and snake it through
the rear firewall and the tunnel to the front where you mount the pump.
** Make sure you use that current path to supply the fuel pump! **
The system is designed to run the pump for only two seconds in the absence
of a timing pulse from the ignition system.  If your engine stops, the pump 
stops running.  I have seen people connect the pump directly to the positive 
bar.  If they were to crash/break a fuel line/whatever, the fuel will keep 
coming.  Can you say "James Bond-like-fireball"?


| What is the concensus
| for the hard lines.  Should the hard lines be replaced?  I know

| for race cars?  

I don't know what the concensus is, but I agree with Stan...not just for
race cars, but any car with this modification.  The fuel lines running
through the tunnel are hard plastic tubes, which are heat-shrunk onto
a short, barbed, metal line where it goes through the front firewall.
On your car, these lines are 20 years old, and the plastic is quite 
brittle.  When you relocate the pump, the fuel pressure will increase, 
which will stress these lines more than the stock configuration.  I 
wouldn't want to smell fuel inside the car someday.  I used anodized 
aluminum lines in my car.  I bought a 25' roll for about $25 from Summit 
Racing, and ran the lines all the way from the rear to the front.  It was
a bit of work, but I can be sure they won't rupture.


| The other question I have is how should the pump be
| mounted on in the front?

Securely. :-)  I've seen lots of ways to mount the pump, but I'll describe
the one I used.  I mounted the pump under the tank so that the hose 
connections to the pump were accessible via the hole underneath.  (I also
mounted the pump on rubber pads to keep the noise down a bit.)  The fuel
filter between the tank and the pump is mounted in the luggage compartment
to facilitate filter replacement.  Also to this end, I have fitted a shutoff
valve between the tank and the filter.  The valve and the filter are mounted 
to a common plate, which is mounted to the wall dividing the fuel tank and
luggage compartments.  This assembly is then hidden by a polished aluminum
cover for cleanliness and to avoid any damage from luggage.  The line from
the tank runs through two factory holes in the front substructure: one on
each side of the rear luggage compartments wall.  These holes are fitted 
with rubber grommets which protect the hose from chafing.  A hole was drilled 
through the rear luggage compartment wall and a grommet was inserted 
to complete the fuel feed from the tank to the pump.  The rest is rather 
straight-forward.

I have seen pumps and filters mounted in the luggage compartment, but this
is usually unsightly.  (Well, the ones I've seen so far anyway.)

A few years ago I owned a '81 911SC. The heat didn't work so

I replaced the wires and after that it worked fine.
WATCH OUT, when you mount your new wire, it's one wire
which splits into 2 wires, almost the same length.
*ALMOST* the same length, guess why I know this fact...

It is likely that oil is being drawn into the air filter box through the oil
tank breather.  The air filter box drain drips onto the engine and
produces the symptoms you describe.  Just check to see if you have oil in the
bottom of the air filter box to confirm.  This can happen if you overfill, a
Porsche specialist that I use recommended against filling right up to the 7

I've got the same problem, but I'm looking for someone that can
change the offset of the wheels. Do any Porschephiles know of
a shop that can machine wheels to a new offset? I realize that 

the wheel needs to have enough material in the hub area that
can be reduced and still be safe...

Thanks for any info

I live in Washington DC. Insurance companies are bailing out of
DC like rats from a sinking ship & this is just what my last
company, Reliance, did.
 
Reliance was charging me $1,700.00/year for a '92 968 Cabriolet.
My new company, State Farm, was charging me about $2,000.00 for
the same car & say that the rate for my new 993 will be about the
same.
 
Anyone know of anything cheaper & I'd be thrilled to hear about

Subject: Delivery of new 993!

I was very sad to sell my '92 968 Cabriolet, but if you have to
sell a car like that it's nice to be able to replace it with a
new 911 (993).
 
This is what I did! Last Friday I took delivery of a midnight
blue (no idea what that is in German) 993. I ordered the car back
in November and have had many sleepless nights until its arrival.
 
Having said that I really haven't been able to get much time in
it - just a few short sprints out of DC on I-66. However, I will
be at our local track at the end of the month and see how it
goes.
 
In the meantime if anyone has any particular questions about the
car please feel free to ask, but take my word for it; it's a
dream machine.
 
By the way, in the Washington Post on Friday was a review of the
car. The writer liked the car but several paragraphs of his
introduction were filled with comments about how it was now
socially acceptable ("politically correct") to be seen in a
Porsche. What a waste of review space.

Last winter i purchased a set of 911 SC power mirrors (hi Tom!) for my
914 to replace the stinky Mini Tornados I have right now (I want mirrors
on both sides, so stock is no go).

VW&P/European Car has shown a couple of 914s with the SC mirrors, but a
friend of mine claims that the weight of the mirrors will end up
bending or even tearing the sheet metal in the doors.  

Before I start drilling holes ... has anyone actually either done this,
or know for certain that it *will* work?  Or will I destroy my 914's
doors by doing this?  :(

Many aircraft piston engines are air-cooled. Throughout history, there has
been an ongoing debate on which is better -- air or liquid cooling. Air
cooling is lighter, more rugged, able to withstand more battle damage if that's
your thing; liquid cooling is more compact, makes a slimmer fuselage,
more speed. Today, most light aircraft engines are air-cooled boxers (horizontally
opposed engines; when one piston moves inward, the one right across from it
is doing the exact same thing; like two boxers trading punches
simultaneously). If you go to an airport, it would be hard to find anything
but a Lycoming or Continental flat-4 or flat-6 engine in just about any
manufactured light airplane.
 
Porsche tried to get into the aircraft engine market (but neglected the
small detail that almost nobody was building light aircraft at the time).
The PFM 3200 engine was a heavily modified (mostly to meet FAA redundancy
requirements) Carrera 3.2 engine. To bring output rpm down from Porsche-like
levels, it had a gearbox hung on the nose of the crank (=more weight). PFM
stands for Porsche Flugmotor, or as somebody at Mooney, one of the
customers, put it, "Pure Effing Magic." It was a great engine with no market
potential. Mooney put a few into their airplanes, but it never caught on.
Too expensive, too thin a service and parts supply net, not any more power
than the old-style engines it replaced.

I've seen the ads too, and the 356 Carerra engines had 4
valve heads, I think. After a lot of testing Porsche decided
that there wasn't enough surface area to air-cool a 4-valve
911 head. Porsche has tended to be a bit conservative in
their engineering, but very few companies have really proven
them wrong in the past.

I like air cooling too, like Ben, I think the sound of a
flat air-cooled engine at 6,000 RPM is close to orgasmic.

Gee, just when I thought that I could adequately model the passing of a
"pinched loaf" through the air and then into water using simple analytical
physical relationships.  Indeed, they are back of the envelope yet result
in a reasonable and tractable approximation of the truth without benefit of
an MIT educaton (lemme see, says here, Chemistry, class of '67).  I now
realize the folly of my ways and recognize that 4 dimensional finite element
approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations describing the passing of an
oblong cylinder through a low viscous fluid across a two fluid boundary,
finally coming to rest in a more highly viscous fluid following viscous
damping, is the only way I'm going to ever get my ideas published.  

First, this approach will completely obscure the problem from the
novice, a commendable goal indeed.  As everyone know, if you're a rocket
scientist who doesn't espouse ALL the technical intracies, regardless of
whether any others understand a thing you're saying, you don't mean doo. 
Second, and perhaps most important,  it really impresses the (name your
favorite partner's gender and/or species here).  

Education is a fine balence between informing the less informed and riding
a serious ego trip.  Let's stick with informing the less informed.  I
guess that it's lucky that John Muir isn't around to take part in these
debates.  His path, which I followed long ago, allowed me to save BIG
MONEY and have a LOT OF FUN fixing my own and other peoples vehicles. 
If you're a regular middle class working stiff who, to own a Porsche, must
fix it themselves, it's nice to know that there is information out there
that will gently help you to help yourself.  If, instead, you're wealthy,
hey hire someone who knows all the details.  You know, Muir never mentions

well, I go to this every year, but I couldn't give you directions because I
always follow friends who are from the area.  It's at a little ski area.
The organizer is in Panorama in the upcoming events section, you can call
him for info.

As for what it's all about, it's really a swap meet, not a concours/track/
autocross/car show/whatever.  It's billed as the largest porsche-only
swap meet in the US.  Most of it is people like us who pay for a space to
set up all the porsche parts they have to sell (only sellers pay admission).  
Also, there is Porsche-only parking area for about 200 cars.  Many people
who park their cars in this area put prices and info on the windshield in
the hopes of selling the car.  Unless the weather is bad, a very good variety
of cars turn out, from 356 to (last year) a 911 speedster '89?.  

If you bring a big vehicle to get big parts, you will be parking far away,
so they have a guy with a quad-runner type of cart to get stuff to your car

The consensus seems to be that you should keep your oil level about
halfway between the two marks on the dip stick. 

I should also probably mention for the benefit of any other newbies that
the first couple of times that I checked the oil and replaced the
dipstick, I did not notice the little guide tube for the dipstick
(dipstick diameter) that is welded to the top surface of the oil filler
neck.  If you don't insert the dipstick in the guide tube, the indicated
level will obviously be wrong.

4) Remove the rollers from the car.  Everyone says that this is
the trickiest thing to do as the rollers rest against the trunk
springs.  If you don't have the special Porsche tool (and who
does) put the open end of a box end wrench through the spring with 
a screwdriver through the other end.  By carefully prying the spring
away from the roller to get it out.  Repeat with the other side (of 
course), and then move the spring arm around to the other side so that it
is out of the way [don't really understand that last instruction].

5) Remove the hinges.

Next, for me will be do try and drill out the affending bolts that
have broken off in the pivots on the car.  If that doesn't work I will have
to remove the hinge pivots and replace them.  From what I have
seen this is a fairly unusual failure mode.  Most people have the pivot
rip off the car.  Hopefully I won't have to go through those steps.
But, if anyone is interested (or if I have to go through it) I will
summarize those steps as well.

I will add to this after I have gone through it.  It anyone has done this 
and has some labour saving suggestions I would LOVE to hear about them!!

Thanks in advance, Alex

I thought a roadster means a two seater convertible. Porsche was never
called a roadster because it is made to seat four people.

I am thinking about changing the motor mount (right side) on  my 86' 951. My
local dealer wants 
$ 210.00 for the part (#951 375 042 04), and 2 hours labor @ $ 65.00 for a total
of $ 340.00, 
excluding tax for the complete job. The car has 91k miles on it.

 Vertex in Florida quoted me $ 119.00 for the same current part. I would like to
do this job myself
and save the $$$ .

I have the workshop manuals and the technical bulletin explaining the procedure.
Can anyone elaborate
on this subject? Any hints or shortcuts? Any suggestions on supporting the
engine, I do not have that
"special tool".Should I follow the workshop manuals directions to the letter? I
am going to use jack stands for support of the car,  can I use a hydraulic jack
to support the engine from underneath?
I am already aware that I must use new 8 * 38mm bolts, 2 washers and locking
nut, eliminating the old bolts, distance washers and nuts.

The workshop manual takes some of the steps for granted (assuming the reader is
already a mechcanic).
Suggestions and any help would be great. I have already replaced my struts
without any problems,  thanks to the help of fellow P-File members. Can I get
through this job the same way?

Subject: Bosch plugs

In an effort to track down a poor idling problem on my 951, I decided
to check the plugs (Bosch WR7DP).  I was amazed at what I found.  On
all four plugs the platinum center electrode had apparently migrated
out of the insulator to varying degrees.  On one plug, the electrode
was extended so far out of the insulator that it was almost touching
the ground conductor (I couldn't even slip a .04mm feeler gauge
between the two):


		  NEW PLUG:			    OLD PLUG:


               ________                          ________
	      / _______|                  	/ _______|
              | | 	  0.8 mm gap		| |	|    almost no gap
              |	|    ___    			| |    _|_
              | |   / | \               	| |   / | \
              | |___| | |___                    | |___| | |___
	      |       |    |	                |       |    |
	              |					|
		      |					|	
		   Center			     Center
		   Electrode			     Electrode


The gap between the insulator and the ground conductor was still the
original 0.8mm and both the insulator and conductor looked in good
condition (i.e., the insulator hadn't burned away nor had deposits on
the conductor closed the gap).  The plugs had been in for only a
little over a year (less than 10,000 miles).  I have been using Bosch
platinum plugs for years and have never seen this kind of behavior.
Has anyone else?

 -Milo

P.S.: New plugs fixed the bad idling.  It's truly amazing the car ran
as well as it did otherwise.

Subject: 951 turbo water pump

Thanks to Doug, Tassos, Mike, Jim and P.C. for their responses.  I
decided to bite the bullet and buy a new pump which I installed last
weekend.  The old pump was still working, but it was encrusted with
dried coolant indicating (along with the occassional grinding noise)
that it probably would not be working for long!

Jim Selders made the observation that the pump shaft could be subject
to stresses resulting from the relative motion of the engine and tub
(the pump body is mounted to the heat shield around the brake system
while the other end is connected to the turbo with a short hose).
This might well have been a factor in the failure of my pump.  I
started noticing the noise not too long after I replaced my engine
mounts.  I used a hoist to suspend the engine while I did this, but
was not particularly successful in holding the engine exactly in its
installed position (i.e., I had to move the engine around a bit in the
compartment to get everything lined up again).  Perhaps I strained the
water pump housing somehow during this operation.  On the other hand,
some of the responses to my posting reported replacing these pumps
with far fewer than the eight years and 102K miles I now have on my
car, so maybe the thing just plain wore out.

Subject: Noise Under Load

My car is producing an intermittent noise.  It is a 1983 944.  The noise is
difficult to describe, but it is coming from the engine compartment and only
occurs when the engine is under moderately heavy load -- generally when I am
accelerating away from a stoplight.  It seems to manifest itself at around 3000
rpm.  The noise doesn't occur when the engine is only lightly loaded.  Although
I am not 100% positive, I don't think that the noise occurs when the engine is
very heavily loaded either (i.e. when I've got the accelerator floored).

The noise is intermittent in the sense that it doesn't occur every time I get
the engine up to 3000 rom under moderately heavy load.  However, once the noise
starts, I can make it come and go at will simply by varying the amount of
pressure I apply to the accelerator.

Unfortunately, I can't really narrow down the source of the noise any better
than this, since it only occurs when the car is moving.  If anyone has any
suggestions on how to better describe my symptoms, I would be happy to oblige.
In the meantime, I certainly welcome any advice on what I should be looking at
to get rid of this noise once and for all.  Thanks in advance!

Blaine, 
	I'm not sure if this applies to Porsches, but the rule of thumb

an impedance of approximately 1kohm/foot. If it is higher than this, it 
is probably a good idea to replace them anyway. If this is wrong, 
hopefully one of the more knowledgeable 'philes will put us both on the

Actually, there were some roadsters in the Porsche history. The 356 B 
roadsters, followed the Drauz convertible which again took over where the 
'Speedster' left. The roadsters was a 'de-luxe' Speedsters with roll up 
windows, standard seats and some other features. I think the last 356 
roadster was buillt late '63.
And for the 356 series the roadster/Drauz conv., speedster bodies are 
sleeker than convertibles due to different rear bodies.

Subject: Re:  4-valve heads


Although most of the boxer engines (except for exotic racing items)
from Porsche have `only' two valves, I did read that since they
are the size of `lavatory seats' then two valves are not a problem.

Of course one may argue that size is not the dominant factor in efficient
induction and exhaust, and that there are advantages to be gained from 
the increased efficiency associated with opening and closing two small 
items at once rather than one great big bog seat.

Is there anyone out there who can explain how Porsche manage
to get such excellent performance out of the boxer with the use of 
two valve head technology? What kind of efficiency increase does
the use of four valves provide? Why do other nameless sports car
builders have to resort to multi valve heads, multiple cams etc,
and still have a tough time matching the boxer for performance and
reliability?

Subj:  356 Drag Coefficients, Efficiency etc

From MAESTRO132@aol.com

TO: 76416.167@CompuServe.COM



 Dear Peter:  



        Thank you for your nice comments on my edited

excerpt about 356 Drag Coefficient, HP, etc. Wouldn't it be

somethin' ifin after all this we became Friends?



My Reply to your comments: 



First, you said, about my Drag Calculations: 



>numerical fairy tales. 



I said:



  Drag Force = Cd*A*p*V**2



where A is the frontal cross sectional Area, 17.3 sq ft.

      p is the density of air (0.08 Lbs/ft**3)

      V is the Velocity, say at 60 MPH (88 ft/sec )

and   Cd is the drag coefficient= 0.365 for a 356 A

                                = 0.398 for a 356 B

                           (and About 0.5 for a Buick)





    Cd, the Cd Drag Coefficient, is straight from an article

in the Factory publication, "Christophorus", about Porsche's

then New & Expensive wind tunnel, complete with all that

High-Class German Test Equipment.  



    The Factory mustave thought, why what better way to test

the new Equipment but to measure the Drag Coefficients of

the Classic 356A and 356B, and compare them  to their more

recent models? Which is what they did. (Guess which one

won?)



    Ergo, both the Drag Coefficient, Cd, and the "Frontal

Area", A, for the 356A & 356B are Factory Obtained, measured

in an expensive, modern, well-instrumented wind tunnel. 



    Personally, I couldn't ask for better Data than that,

and that's why I used it.



     So, really, where was the error there?



          The Velocity was a "given" at 60 MPH which is, of

course  88.0 feet per  second, so there's absolutely no

error there.



    I expected more of an argument over the Density of Air

(rho), which is a function of Temperature, Pressure, and

Humidity, among other things like Elevation, but assumed a

sea level value of .08 lb/ft**3. (Air's density is really

0.0808 Lb/Ft**3 @ 0 deg C, 1 atm, but we weren't after three

digit accuracy here, as Kibo will testify.) 

 

    Uh, so, once again, where was the error in the

Calculation of Drag Force?



    The Calculated 121.4 Pounds-force at 60 MPH compares

favorably with the Data from the Original Road & Track

Reprints of 356 Road Tests from the '50 and '60's, when R&T

readers wanted that stuff. R&T no longer lists the Drag

Force and that's a Damn Shame!



      When R&T did measure the Drag Force at 60 MPH, they

presented it at the bottom of the box labeled "TAPLEY DATA".

The Numbers were, as I recall:





Vehicle     Weight      Drag Force at 60 mph 

            Curb/Test   (from R&T "Tapley Data" Box.)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------

1966 912                 N/A--  same  reason

- -------------------------------------------------------------



    (Aside to R&T: please, Please, PLEASE put the "Drag At

60MPH"  back into the Road Test! It's simple, quick, and

then all cars  can be easily compared!)



   Hummh, guess the Factory was Right too- the 356A Coupe

DOES have the Lowest Drag Coefficient of all 356's! No

wonder they're such Classics.



  Now then, though I calculated 121.4 Lbs-force, I used 120

Lbs  in the Mileage Calculations, since that's about equal

to a 356 Carrera 2 Liter with Luggage.



      What is really great about the methods R&T used to get

the Drag Force is that YOU or ANYbody else can use this

method too! All you need is a reasonably accurate wristwatch

and Speedometer! It's simple, accurate and relatively

ingenious- a good example of Applied Engineering you can do

at home. (Well, On The Road at least.)



   Moreover, R&T's method accounts for ALL the parasitic

losses- INCLUDING Air Resistance, wheel bearing friction,

flat tires, dragging brake shoes, dangling brake lines,

dragging illegal aliens, flopping undercoating, and anything

else unique to your car!

 

    And the Beauty is that you don't need 30 K worth of the

Finest German Testing Equipment. All you need is that

reasonably accurate wristwatch and speedo. 



    It's Elegant Simplicity, Junk Yard Engineering at its

finest. A Solution the Maestro likes.



    Simply take your Porsche- ANY Porsche, yea any vehicle

for that matter, (except for possibly Automatics), out to a

long, level, windless, deserted road. Ideally, where the

Speed Limit is 65, so one can do this in a  legal-like

manner. And with a Passenger to record the Data. After all,

the Maestro wouldn't want to encourage you to do anything

illegal or stupid, like driving with your hands off the

wheel.



     Maintain, say a constant 65 MPH where Legal to do so.

(Oh, all right  cheat for a second. Do 70mph. Tell the cop

that it was all in the interests of Science.)



     Then put the clutch down, the gearshifter in neutral

and coast. Have someone watch your Speedometer, and call out

and record the Time to reach various Speeds- such as 65 MPH,

60 MPH, 55 MPH 50 MPH.  Repeat a few times to get Data you

believe in, Statistically Significant as it were.



     Plot a graph of speed (either in mph or ft/sec, just be

consistent) vs Time (seconds). 



    Take slope of graph at 60 MPH or approximate it by

(Delta V)/(Delta T) by taking say, the change in speed from

65mph to 55mph (that's 10mph or 14.7 ft/sec), divided by the

Time from 65mph to 55mph.



    Make sure you convert from miles/hr/sec to feet/sec/sec.



     This gives you the retarding Acceleration, a, in

ft/sec/sec or ft/sec**2, caused by the summation of

Everything working to slow you down.

From: Harry Pellow <maestro@well.sf.ca.us>


   To get the retarding or Drag FORCE, one must use the

Complex Expression:



    F=ma. 



   For which the Maestro automatically got 1 point on the

Friday Freshman Physics quiz at a medium-size Engineering

School by the banks of the River Charles.



    We want Force, and we now know acceleration, a. So, all

we need is the mass, m. How to get "m"? 



    Solution A.- drive to a Public scale- and weigh your

car! If they let you stay inside, stay inside and get the

weight of the car + you. And your passenger, if one.   



    Or, weigh yourself and your Passenger separately, and

add that to  the car's weight.



    Solution 2 ifin you have a 356, 912 or early 911: The

Maestro has presented the Curb & Test weights of various 356

models, so you may simply choose to use these + you and your

passenger's weight and continue.

    This works for 356's, 912's, 911's, 924's, 944's, 928's

and Cadillacs! Speaking of Cadillacs, you said:



>This sort of "analysis" gives us 100 mile-per-gallon

>Cadillacs if you add up all the mpg claims for aftermarket

>devices in the J.C. Whitney catalog. 



   Weeeeell, not exactly. First of all, the Cadillac's CD is

more like 0.5, (anybody know for sure?), and the Cross

Sectional Area, by Actual Maestro Measurement using the

Maestro's own work boot (which is within 1/16" of the King's Foot),

on a 1969 Cadillac parked next to Trusty Rusty in the Costco 

parking lot, got about 6'x 4.5' or 27 square feet. 



   Using these numbers, compared to the 356, the Cadillac would get:



          Drag, Lbs: F=Cd*p*A*v**2       Cd       p       A       V

 Cadillac    17.76                                     





   So, by my calculations, the Cadillac would get some 17

MPG at 60MPH, not 100. Where did that 100 MPG Cadillac come

from anyway? 



  You said: 



>Pellow's mpg calculations are shoddy. On page T6 of the 

>356 B repair manual (German edition) the minimum bsfc 

>(brake specific fuel consumption) of a 75 hp

>1600 S engine is given as 245 g/hp-hr at 3700 rpm.



Well, on page E89 of the ENGLISH edition of the Maestro's

very own & Original 356B Factory Workshop Manual, the

Specific Fuel Consumption of the 1600S 75 HP Super, in

oz/Hp-hr is a tad less than 8 oz/Hp-hr, (like about 7.5

oz/Hp-Hp. I assumed 8 oz/Hp-hr, or half a pound (0.5 Lbs).

Maybe they sent the more efficient engines Over Here.

(Don't we wish?)



  You said:



>Just as Pellow's engine number/date stamp curve fits have 

>equations with 12-significant-figure coefficients for data ...



  Hey, you get a point for that! I left in the Slope &

Intercept values the Computer printed for the Least Squares,

Best Straight Line fit to the Case Casting Number/Date Stamp

data. But the easily-memorized Swap Meet Equation: 



Case Birthday= 1955.5 + 1.1*(Times the Case Casting Number/10,000)



has the proper number of Significant figures.



  Oh, and 30 week differences in the Date Stamp of two

case halves in the same engine are extremely rare. Most

Matched Case Halves have Date Stamps within a handful of

weeks of each other.



  What IS Interesting about the Graph of Case Casting

Numbers vs Date Stamp, is that ifin you lay your eye at the

bottom of the page and look up at the graphed data, you can

see the vertical "lines" at Constant Date Stamp! These are

the (vertical) range of engine numbers that were made from a

single run of cases with the same Date Stamp. One can almost

estimate the number of "Batches" that were made, and maybe,

which batches were the Good Ones or had the Late-Model

Goodies. That's available too, in my Engine Data Base. 

 

   (Don't worry, I won't send the Maestro's Engine Data

Base over, it has 4,000 Engine Data Points, is some 250K

long, and probably wouldn't be appreciated by the non-912,

"900" series people.) 



And, finally- boy do the Porsche gods like Irony- here's

another example: 



You Said:



>Measured fuel consumption (of the Type 993) is 31.8 mpg at

>90 km/h (56 mpg) (SIC!) and 25.8 mpg at 120 km/h (74.6 mph).



  Well, Pete, you mentioned something about the 100 MPG

Cadillac, and here you go with the 56 mpg Type 993!!!  Boy,

56 Miles Per Gallon in the new 911 is really something! Or

is that just another "typo"? If it's NOT a typo, I'd suggest

you park that 56mpg 911 next to the 100 mpg Cadillac in the

Costco parking lot! 



 Keep the 356 Faith!!!

Over the last year or so there have been several exchanges on
cleaning/preserving products.  Some of the advise I distilled:

1. 303 Protectant for vinyl, plastic and rubber.
2. Meguire's wax for painted surfaces.
3. Lexol for leather.

Recently, I've been searching for a product to use on WHEELS and our local
P_dealer has a product SP21 or some such string of letters and numbers.  It
looks sort of like Windex (maybe more green!).  It is a spray-on-rinse-off
kind of product.  The instructions are quite clear (emphatic?) about rinsing
it off completely, even going so far as testing with touch - as in, is it
squeeky to the touch?  But, it also says no scrubbing need, just spray and
rinse.  This kind of concerns me.  If you just spray and it works by it self
there must be some strong chemical reactions going.  That's ominous when
going on around my well waxed paint and around tires (I recall a polymer
panic when the idea of painting a helmet was mentioned).

What is the net knowledge of wheel cleaning products?

Hi, Alex.
 
Do NOT under any circumstances try to weld the tank. Even if you rinse out
the gas, boil the tank, whatever, you will STILL have gas fumes in it when
you weld. The gas gets into pores in the metal and comes out when you heat
it. Gasoline vapor in an enclosed space is also known as a bomb. The tank
can be welded, but unless you are a professional welder, take it to a shop
that specializes in this. They can do it. They boil the tank out, fill it
with water to nearly the level of the holes, and weld a patch on it.
 
I would not recommend any sort of "better living through chemistry" fixes.
Epoxy, fiberglass, whatever, I'd be concerned about how long they last.
 
Suggest you swap tanks, at least for now.

The old 356 Carrera had four cams, two plugs per cylinder and way too many
gears, but only two valves -- big ones though.
 
As far as I know, all of the recent flat-6 race engines (For the 956/962C)
with 4-valve heads had water cooling for the heads at least, eventually also
the cylinders. The 959 had water-cooled 4-valve heads also. So it's
probably safe to say that Porsche has never had air-cooled 4-valve
heads in production or racing. (Did I miss any?)
 
If Porsche comes out with 4-valve heads on the street 911 or even the
Boxster in the future, it's a safe bet that they will need to be water cooled.

Hi, Barry.
 
I can't tell if your car is a Weissach edition or not. I think that was a
combination of options and a specific color -- platinum, I think. But your
car is definitely a Euro-spec car, and it sounds like it has just about
every option in the book. The rear fog light and fender marker
lights are a giveaway, and I don't think the automatic temperature control
in the center console was ever offered in the U.S.; all we ever got on those
cars were the two red handles. Weissach edition may have been a U.S. only
marketing package, I don't know. You could call PCNA in Reno.
 
The side marker lights were new in 1980.
 
Juergen Barth's book on Porsches is known to have some mistakes in it, but
here's what it gives for power and serial numbers:
 
Your serial number, 91A0131470, corresponds to a non-US car built in 1980.
Those fall in the range 91A0130001 to ...0134831. The corresponding US

There was indeed a Porsche model known officially as a Roadster. The 356
Convertible D, bodied by by D'Ieteren in Belgium, was eventually renamed the
356 Roadster. It had a lower, chrome-rimmed windshield than the Cabriolet.
The Convertible D replaced the Speedster in August of 1958. The Roadster is
one of the most desirable of all 356 models, behind the Carrera and
Speedster.
 
According to Brett Johnson's "356 Restorer's Guide to Authenticity" the
Convertible Ds and Roadsters did not have rear seats, while Speedsters
had rear cushions and sometimes rear seatbacks. Cabriolets had rear
seats.
 
Somewhere recently I saw a story on the origin of the word Cabriolet. If I
remember correctly, it claimed that Cabrio came from an Italian mountain goat
or some such, and in the horse-drawn carriage days there was a type of cart
that was called a cabrio because it bounced around like one of those goats.
Somewhere, either in Italy or England, people who rented these out put signs
on them to the effect that they were "cabrios to let". Which got shortened
to cabriolet, and eventually cab. And their drivers became known as cabbies.
If this story is true, then the pronunciation should be with a
T at the end, not French-style, --lay. Does anybody remember seeing this
story?

About two months ago, I bought two radar detectors from this store, with a total

For what it's worth, I was happy enough that when I bought a Sony
AM/FM/cassette/CD changer stereo set-up a month ago, I called them to see what
their pricing was.  As it turns out, I didn't buy the stereo from them since I
could actually get them cheaper from my local store.  If anyone is interested, I
bought a Sony CDX-U303 changer and a Sony XR-U660 receiver.  Maybe others can

Subject: '51 Cabriolet...



   Well, I checked out the '51 cabriolet yesterday after work.  After
the discussion on roadster vs. cabriolet that was one of the things
that I checked for.  The book that I'd looked at before checking out
the car said that it was a "cab".  I think it was Lance that said
cabriolet meant a painted portion of the car extending up next to the
windshield as opposed to just a metal or aluminum frame.  Sure enough,
it had a strip of bodywork that turned up from the fender area and ran
up along the outside of the windshield which would be painted the same
color as the body (this one didn't have any paint on it!).  

   Anyway, I tagged along with a friend to look at the car, he's the
potential buyer.  I know basically nothing about Porsche's and
especially the old ones.  As I said before this one in a '51.  Its
owner bought it in '67, drove it or a year or so, got drafted, went to
war, and came back to a broken transaxle (his brother drove it while
he was away).  The car sat until about eight years ago when he decided
to take it apart and "restore" it.  He got it apart, but never put it
back together.  He basically has everything for the car except the
dashboard, lenses for the lights and windshield glass.  When he bought
the car it already had a 1500cc motor in it... bummer.  I guess the
40bhp wasn't enough for the original owner!  8-)  He said we could
have the 1500 but he didn't think we'd want it.

   Rust!  The exterior body panels are in "good" shape.  We poked and
prodded our way around the car and didn't find any weak areas in the
outer skin.  The areas that were bad were inner fender wells behind
the front tires, the area at the base of the "post" that the door
closes against (on both sides) and about six inches of the passenger
floorboard along the outer seam.  We were surprised at the overall good
shape of the car.  A trip to a strip shop and some sheetmetal fixes
and a restoration would be on its way.  

   The owner is asking, what we think, is a little too much so we're
gunna work on him.  It looks like his wife wants the car to go, so
there's hope!  8-)

   I'll try not to ramble so much next time!

I believe that the end-to-end resistence is normally stamped onto

You can meter them with any old multi-meter, and as long as the
impedence is about right, the wire should be fine for you.

Spark plug wires seem to go bad very, very rarely on Porsches.  And
of course they are quite expensive.  My own car has over 70K and its
original wires.  Only thing I've replaced is one of the spark plug
connectors, which I stupidly broke while removing last year.  (The

Subject: Las Vegas PCA Race

Well I'll say this, it was a hellofa weekend.

Actually, my weekend started out a little early since it was my region
(Intermountain) that was co-hosting the event.  I went down on Wednesday to
see if I could be of any help and, too, this was the maiden wheel 2 wheel
voyage for the Six and there was Test and Tune on Thursday so, why not.

Thursday started out with a bang, literally when, after seven practice
laps, I managed to spin off the track backwards at a little over 80 MPH.
It seems that in the Six, the line through turn One is a little more of an
exact science than it was in my old fourbanger.  Anyhow, aside from a torn
dust boot and ten pounds of dirt inside my nice clean car, no damage was done.

Friday was supposed to be a Derek Bell Racing School, but it got canceled
at the last minute so I spent the day at the hotel, bench racing in the
parking lot and getting the Tech Area ready for the afternoon's insanity.

Las Vegas Speedway is an interesting track.  A nine-turn, 1.6 mile, flat as
a pancake deal where, once you learn the line :->, you can drive from the
apex of Nine all the way to the entrance into Three without lifting. (Dave
Ferguson may not agree with me on that).  Turn Three is also the best
passing place.  Turns Four through Eight are a high speed "connect the
dots" section with the turn Four-Five connection being the most difficult
to master.  The entrance into Eight is very fast.  Nine is a diminishing
radius "J hook" leading onto the straight and therefore is the most
important corner on the track.  This is my "home track" and I have been
through Nine at least 500 times and still don't quite understand it!

Saturday was practice, practice, practice.  They had broken us down into
three run groups (Fast, Faster, and Fastest) and we had 3 thirty-minute
practice sessions before lunch and one after.   Then the fun began.  This
was my fourth W2W but I still get excited when it's time to do the practice
starts.  Each run group took turns gridding up behind the pace car which
was a beautiful dark metallic blue 993 cabriolet furnished by Steve
Clifford Porsche out of Provo Utah.  We followed the Pace Car around once
and then they dropped the green flag and we raced through turn Three, then
we gridded up and did it again.  On the third start we had a "fun race" for
seven laps.  By the time all three run groups were done it was
O:beer-thirty and time for a track side party.

Sunday had a ominous start when some guy rolled his Carrera cabrio exiting
turn One. No injuries, but the flight home must not of been much fun.
Plus, it was hot!  Saturday was around 90 and Sunday felt even hotter.
Attrition was taking its toll on both cars and drivers.  My morning
practice went well and I was beginning to think that just maybe I had a
chance at a decent finish.  But on about lap four of the qualifying race,
my right-side carburetor linkage let go and I limped back to the pits
unable to finish.  The fix was quick and easy but not finishing the
qualifier meant starting the race all the way at the back. (15th) Rats!

To make a long story short, starting at the back ain't always bad.  At
least you can see what's going on in front and there's no one along side to
get in your way.  I finished third in class and seventh over all.  Not what
I'd hoped for but better than I expected.

Okay Furgi, your turn.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the fan blowing air over the

Subject: 951 MOTOR MOUNTS

Michael,

Replacing the motor mounts can be done fairly easily with the
help of a large rack (e.g. for alignments).  With that setup,
you can replace the mounts in about 2 hours.

Without that setup, e.g. laying on your back in your garage with
jackstands for support and using a floor jack, I would suggest
about 4-5 hours as a guess.

You will have to loosen and perhaps remove the steering rack in
order to drop the crossmember, while supporting the motor either
by an engine hoist or some other method.

The nice thing about the alignment rack is the two dolly jacks
which can be used to support the motor while you stand up and
remove the crossmember.

Good Luck,

Something that I only recently figured out is that not all "horizontally
opposed" or "flat" engines are boxers.  This came out of trying to figure
out what Mercedes Benz meant when they referred to their 3.5L flat 12(?)
as a "180 degree V-12".  This was built for the Euro sportscar championship.
What I finally realized is that the distinction between a boxer and a
non-boxer flat engine is that a boxer does not share journals on the 
crankshaft between opposing cylinders.  V engines share crank journals.

The tradeoffs are that a boxer would be a longer and most likely heavier
engine than one which shares crank journals.  On the flip side, there can
be more crank bearings to support the loads.  Going much beyond 6 cylinders
in a boxer might be a problem (my guess!).

Another famous non-boxer flat 12 was the 917 engine -- which actually
had the power take-off in the center of the crank with three journals on 
each end.  This minimized torsional flexing of the crankshaft.

Subject: Re: 4-valve heads

Ben,

There are a couple of advantages to four-valve heads.  First is, as
you mention, better induction and so better volumetric efficiency.
That is, for a normally-aspirated engine with displacement N litres,
you get closer to N/6 litres of air/fuel in each cylinder on each
stroke.

Other important advantages are that each of the valves is lighter
and has a smaller area-to-perimeter ratio.  The lighter weight means
less reciprocating mass, and ends up meaning that the engine can
rev higher with less chance of float and less work being done.

The smaller area-to-perimeter means that combustion heat absorbed by
the valve can be better dissipated to the head.  Burning valves can
be a real problem.

The negatives of a multi-valve head include the added camshaft normally
required, along with attendant hardware.  Because more of the surface
of the combustion dome is consumed by the ports, there is less
freedom in where you put the spark plug.  The centre position for
a single plug is pretty good, but twin-plugging becomes problematic,
particularly as a non-OE operation.

It seems that the lessened head surface area also makes cooling the
head (and so, the valves) problematic.

I would disagree with a statement to the effect that Porsche has done
so well with two-valve heads that four-valve heads are unnecessary.
Simply look at the horsepower improvements cars in the 944 and
928 series had when they went four-valve, and understand that Porsche
did a pretty darn good job with the two-valve waterpumpers' heads
otherwise.  It is also worth recognizing that multi-port heads have
gone from being a new technology to being de rigeur in the rest of
the sports car world.

It is probably fairer to say that Porsche has simply hit a technologic
wall with the design of air-cooled 911-series street engines, and
that we will never see an air-cooled four-valve head.

This is all off the top of my head.  Probably left something out.

Tom --
I never tried this, but one of the most elegant solutions I saw for adding

They're plentiful at auto recyclers, and they have the right P-like shape,
but are scaled just right for the 914.
I believe European Car (back when they were still VW&Porsche) did a couple of
stories on cars that had gone this route and I thought they looked just
'right'.
I'm not sure how involved reshaping the mounting-point profile to match the
914 doorskin would be, but it doesn't seem to be anything a little careful
filing couldn't handle, and the resulting mirror shouldn't threaten the
integrity of the door.
Since you already have the 911 mirrors you may not be interested in
alternatives, but the 'net being what it is, somebody else might be...

Subject: Re: Replacing 951 Motor Mounts

Mike,

I'll bet you can do this job without much difficulty.  Two hints come
to mind:

1. Yes, support the engine from below.  If you use your hydraulic jack
on something close to the front of the engine, it will tilt it a little
better than were you to jack on the oil pan.  I think the power steering
pump bracket may be your best bet.

If you have a shock tower (strut) brace, remove it before tilting so
that you don't smoosh your manifold.  Keep your eyes peeled for anything
else which might stress or collide.

Whatever you jack on, try to distribute the load as much as possible
by placing a block of wood between the jack and object.  (BTW, for
other readers, jacking on the plastic oil pan of a 944S2 or 968 is
not recommended.)

2. The big bolt on the new mount is longer than it needs to be.  If
you find getting the old, collapsed mount out to be difficult, think
about how much fun you'll have fiddling the new, longer one in.  I
forget exactly how much we cut off mine last year.

3. Replace all hardware you touch, use anti-seize on everything you
put back on.  The m/m hardware is a pain to get at, and having it
seize would be a real drag.  But you knew that.

I bought a turbo mount for ~$140 a couple of years ago. $119 seems cheap
but possible, just check that the part number is the latest (not sure what
the latest is...).

Part of the procedure outlined in the manual is not necessary (or was not
necessary for the exhaust side mount that I replaced). I think the
unnecessary procedure had to do with loosening part of the steering.

(From two year old and failing memory) all I did was place the car on
jackstands, place a floor jack with block of wood under the oil pan, remove
the heat shields around the mount, loosen all the bolts of the old mount,
loosen the 2 large bolts securing the passenger side of the aluminum
crossmember, *carefully* jack up the engine an inch or two while
*carefully* prying down one side of the aluminum crossmember to just barely
remove the old mount and insert the new one - it was a tight fit especially
to install a full height new mount. Installing the bolts of the new mount
might have also been a tight fit, but less memorable than actually fitting
the new mount.

Hope this helps.

In "Unfair Advantage" Mark Donohue describes a Porsche prototype based
on the 917 engine that had 18 cylinders.  He said that when you

before the other side.  I suspect he was exaggerating, but it is an

Howdy all,

Based on the advice I have gotten from the list, and my own peace of
mind I decided to swap in a spare tank.  No big deal.  With wire
splicing, and replacing lines I was done in about an hour.  But the
car wouldn't start!!  I opened the check valve in the fuel rail and
there was no fuel!  Something was obviously wrong.  I check all
the lines, and they aren't stopped up, and the fuel does pour out
of the gas tank.  The thing I found is what seems to be a really wierd
hose arrangement at the fuel pump.  Let me describe it
here:

gas tank feed line -- splits into	- marked R on fuel pump

					- fuel pressure reg


					- marked R - to gas tank

fuel from gas tank ----splits into 	- marked D - to fuel rail

					- marked S - to fuel filter


fuel filter connected to 		- S on fuel pump

					- return line to gas tank


The manual (Hayes) say that the letter on the pump translate to
	R - Return
	D - Damper
	S - Suction.

The above layout doesn't make alot of sense to me.  I would expect 
something like:

fuel from gas tank connect to		- fuel filter
fuel filter connected to		- Suction on fuel pump
Damper (??) on fuel pump connected to	- fuel rail
Return (??) on fuel pump connected to	- return line to gas tank
Fuel pressure regulator return conn to	- return line to gas tank

Doesn't this make LOTS more sense?  If anyone has any comments
please send them to me directly. I really need to get this car
moving on its own power this afternoon!!  And none of the manuals
describe how the fuel is actually routed on the pre 75 cars.  This
is all for a '74 1.8L 914, BTW.

Grab that sucker! It's at least $5000, maybe as much as $8000 under market
value. This assumes no rust, no welding required, original engine and trans.
Any extras on it, like sunroof, radio, leather?
 
I bought a C, not SC, under similar circumstances for $13K and still think I
got a deal. My car had NO rust, still intact original undercoating, tool
kit missing only the pressure gauge, rough paint but basically sound body,
tired, nicked interior vinyl that had been out in the sun too long.
 
My chrome had little tiny pits in it too. I took every piece of chrome off
the car and had it redone, cost $1800, by Lemon Grove Plating in National
City. They do great work and stand behind it. If they damage a part
(overbuffing the detail out of it, for example) they'll pay for a new one
and redo it. They haven't lost a part of mine yet, and I've sent them over
130 pieces. Tel. 619-474-4424 or 264-8053.
 
I just got the car back from the upholsterer in San Diego yesterday, and he
did an amazing job. Even came in under his original estimate. The work was
done by Thomas Pocius, at Thomas Auto Trim, 619-299-1356. He is considerably
lower priced than Autos International up the road, and I think does a more
authentic job. For example, the perforated center panels of the seats are
often restored with the wrong (Mercedes?) perforation. Thomas gets it right.

This could be a couple things:

1) The filter bypass pressure relief valve is stuck.  There was a tech 
bulletin about this.  Old ones have a separate spring and little parts 
that can jam.  You may hear a quiet "bang" followed by oil pressure, 
when this gets un-stuck.  I've had this happen a few times, and so have 
friends.

Check the workshop manuals.  There's a new valve available

2) Your oil pump may indeed have decided to croak, but did it work 
prior to changing the oil?  It's highly, highly unlikely that it would 
choose that moment to spontaneously fail.  You'd probably hear a side 
effect of the broken pieces too.

60 seconds w/o oil pressure is scary!  I get nervous after 5 seconds.  
In my experiences, I've found it helps to blip the throttle a *small* 
amount (<2.5K rpm for 1-2 secs.) to get the pressure going and "pop" 
the pressure valve after an oil change.

Subject: '51 Cabriolet

Hi, Dan.
 
From your description, it sounds like a major project, best left to a pro
restorer. Depends on the price, too, of course. How much does he want?
 
Rust -- this is what's gonna getcha. I just helped a friend restore the
front closing panels, behind the front wheels, which you describe. That
job isn't too bad, depending on how well you can butt weld and grind
welds down flush. If the rust has gotten to the top of the closing panel,
where it tucks up under the rear top of the front fender, you should
cut the fenders off to do it right, and that's a major job.
 
Floorpan rust -- after the torsion bar tubes, the most critical area of them
all. Unless the car is jigged correctly while welding in a new floor, it will
never be right again. Especially a cabrio, which sags more. My friend
didn't believe his coupe would sag on the rotisserie (after all, it has a
roof holding things together, right? And we're not even talking about
floor work on his car; it's basically intact). Yesterday we hung the doors
and got the gaps more or less right by adjusting the hinges and shims.
Then we had to turn the car upside down for something else, and the
bottom door gap opened up to 1/4 in. at the rear and the bottom rear
edge touched the lockpost. Lesson: coupes sag. By inference, cabs
sag lots more.
 
It sounds like you will need a new floor. I just saw a Roadster at a local
restoration shop yesterday, and the floor was perfect. It was difficult
to tell that it was a replacement floor. That's how it has to be done,
and that's a job for a pro.
 
Check the torsion bar tubes. If the rear tube is rotted, walk away from
this one. If the front is rotted it's still a major job.
 
The rust at the base of the lockpost may be minor, requiring only
lockpost replacement (but then you have to get the doorgaps right,
by leading the post) or it may be a sign of cancer in the longitudinals,
which along with the floor are another major operation.
 
Be aware that the parts network for the pre-A models is very sparse. Even if
everything is there, if the car is going to be driven, it will need
maintenance parts. A '51 would probably not be a good first choice for a
first restoration project.
 
This car should have a "split windshield," which is a very rare model.
You're talking about basically the second year of Porsche mass production
(not counting the 50-odd cars that were hand-made in Austria before they
moved to Stuttgart).
 
How much does he want? If it's cheap enough, you've got little to lose.
If he wants collector prices, you should be a collector to want it badly
enough. If it's cheap, you might make a fun driver out of it. To make it
a perfect show-car restoration, you'll need an original two-piece-case
engine and hard to find stuff like that. An early car like that may make
an interesting race car; the earlier, the lighter they were. Still, you're
looking at major work, from your description.

Well, from what I understand about synthetics, it's bad to use them in air
cooled engines, since they don't absorb heat like normal oil (necessary for 
proper cooling of a 911/912/914/VW engine).  I know of some people who are
doing research on various synthetics to determine if any of these oils can 
absorb and then subsequently dump heat, but so far, the results are inconclusive
if not downright unpromising.

The bad thing about synthetics is that if you are running an oil temperature
gauge, everything will appear to be fine and dandy because the oil will never 
get that hot--the most it will do is reflect the temperature of the surrounding
engine.  If you had a cylinder head temperature gauge, I'll bet that it would
show a far higher temperature than normal for your car (since it only has the
air to cool it).

If there have been other tests that show that synthetic oil (or specific brands)
have heat absorbing characteristics, I have not yet heard about it.  Until I do,
I'm gonna stick with good old dead-dinosaur brand oil, and leave the synthetics
to the water-boxers.

On the other hand, synthetic gear oil is *great* for trannies!

I've delt with PAR and Vertex.

My advise is don't do business with PAR.  They sent me south american 
wheel bearings (yes, I did forget to ask if the bearings were german...) 
and they sent my girlfriend a defective 951 motor mount - get the part 
number from the dealer and be sure they are selling what you want!

No problems with vertex.

What I *really* wanted to mention is this:

Always [**always**] use a credit card with an out of state purchase.

You will often be surcharged 2%-3%.  However, you have no effective

If you can convince the credit company that you've been burned, they will
credit you and bill the seller.

	I am never entirely positive about anything, but I believe the
Ferrari 512 Berlineti (sp?) Boxer that preceded the 512 TestaRossa was a
12-cylinder boxer.  It was out I believe in the late 70's and early 80's.

There is no 95 993 w/ a wide body option, slant nose, or targa, for that

are not a problem.  Rumor has it that the now expanded engine bay may

I used two jacks to support my engine from underneath - a hydraulic jack and 
the jack that came with the car. I put some blocks of soft wood between the 
jacks and the engine to distribute the force.

Since I was doing other work on the car at the time, I had to remove the 
frame cross-member to which the mounts are attached. This made the job of 
changing the mount very easy, but I assume you should be able to change the 
mount without removing the cross-member.

Hello all,

I hope this is not too cheesy of a post for this group, but...

I admit it, I watch the TV show on FOX, Wed. nights called Beverly
Hills 90210.  One of the people in the show, Dylan, a rich Beverly
Hills kid drives a mint condition Porsche 356.  In the espisode I am
thinking of, his car got car-jacked, and when he went to the police
impound yard to see if it had been recovered, he asked for a
911.  This was a big mistke in the script.  You would at least think
the actor would know what type of car he is driving on the set.
Though I drive a 911, and have never seen a 356 in real life, I know 
it is a 356 in the show, not a 911.  I wonder who's car this is in 
real life?  Anyone from CA know more about this?  It is a dark midnight
blue color, seems fully restored, and is seen in many episodes.  

BTW: The producer of this show, is the same person who does Melrose
Place, another TV nighttime soap opera on FOX, following B.H. 90210.  
In Melrose, Heather Locklear (Amanda) drives a Red 911 Carrera Cabriolet, 
brand new.  I wonder if the producer/director has some sort of deal 
with Porsche to put these cars in the set, or maybe he just knows where
it's at?  :-) Sorry for any wasted bandwidth, just thought all thoose 356 
and Carrera lovers might want to tune in.

    original color, sunroof, new Webers.  Interior has a few tears.
    I want at least 10K for my replica.  Do you think this is a fair trade?

2.  Any common problems I should know about with this model.

3.  The owner claims the car is a "screamer", since he used E cams on the 
    rebuild.  Just how much faster would the car be with E cams instead of
    the T cams?

Dave Darling did a good job of remembering my usual recomendations. Thanks,
Dave!

Let me add to that: deep sumps are not what you need, since  they only
solve part of the problem. You'd need baffles and all sorts of interesting
stuff to keep from cavitating under hard cornering. Plus, giving up the
strainer screen will significantly reduce the life of your engine. Even
if the additional oil (which mainly helps with cooling) adds life, it
won't balance out.

If you have the engine apart, and if you think you'll ever add a remote
oil cooler (recommended, with fan) or a remote non-bypass oil filter
such as the Canton/MECA or System 1 units (*HIGHLY* recommended) or an
Accusump (critical if you race, time trial, or autox the car hard), then
you'll want to add the "high capacity" pump. It's from Melling, whether
you buy it from Automotion, Fast Freddy, FAT, or whomever.

Dig back into the archives - I spent a long time at one point about a year
ago talking about how to *REALLY* fix the oil system on a 914.

As usual, Kevin off the top of his head gets all the points... 

Interesting side note: you can make *MUCH* better air
flow thorough a cross-flow head with two valves than you can with
four or six or ... But the problem is that you can't rev as high
due to material strength issues, and reciprocating mass. And, since
we all know that HP = C * torque * RPM, more RPM is a good thing if you
want more power (ultimately, the secret of most of my race motors -- 
things are done to give me 500-1500 more RPM than my competitors).

As a counterpoint to the "can't air-cool four-valve heads" issue:
well our buddies at PAG maybe can't but ever look at a '70s motorcycle?
I had (until recently, when I traded it for a pair of 915s) a '69 
Honda CB-450. Right there on the side plate "Four Valve Double Overhead
Cam"? Interesting little sucker to take apart, too. Ran great up to
oh, 11K RPM or so... And all it's successors were even better.

Actually, I've seen one trick here I *REALLY* like: after sending the tank
to a radiator shop to be "boiled out", you take a running car,
hook a hose up to the exhaust and run one end into the tank, then after 
a while, it's safe to weld. The CO and CO2 in the exhaust displace enough
O2 to keep you from getting ignition...

sanding.  Sandblasting or grinding/filling not required.  I asked

was always fixed",  Looking underneath, the lower right corner of
the front trunk area had at one time been dented in and dinged
out.  The rocker areas aren't rusted, one side got up against a
curb or something at one time.  He has the original radio, which
he says still works, although the car currently has a cheapo tape
deck in it. No sunroof, non-original outside mirror, aftermarket
muffler not using the bumperguard exhaust ports, rear bumper has
slight dent in center.  When he overhauled the engine, he saved
the original pistons/sleeves because the overhauler wanted them.
He figured they must be worth keeping.

     the deal is, a colleague here at work is looking at it.  He
took me along because he thinks I am an authority (despite my
disclaimers to the contrary).  Anyway, he has first dibs.  If he

It's apparently a good time to chat about MM again!

After examinig the part no's on several 944/951 MM
I can tell you this:
Each MM from 86 on has two part #'s. one each starting
with 944 and 951

for instance in '86 the part # for that year (GREEN flavor)
944.375.042.02 & 951.375.042.01
^^^         ^^   ^^^         ^^
Then there where blue, black and ?? flavors. 
Those 'upgrades' led to the present ORANGE flavor
944.375.042.05 & 951.375.042.04
            ^^               ^^
There also may be a 951...05 number around as well?

Lesson: pay atention to if the # starts with 944 or 951.
{p.s I have a lousy memory and am not working from my notes}

In any event, I've disected several including the 'latest'
and have found them all very similiar in construction.

THE ONLY diferance being a BIT more rubber in the 'doughnut' area of
later part #'s.  The composition and modulus of the
rubber appears to be the same.  The glycol/water ?
in the middle and the orifice plate are the same
for all #'s i've discombobulated. (no steel springs folks)

What does it mean?  You probably can expect a bit more
life out of the later part #, but I doubt more than
25%.  Simply due to the design of the unit.  There
is only so much mass there to absorb/disipate all
that VIBRATION energy.  And from the looks of the
spacing around the mount there is not much room
to add more material to the mount,
while maintaining the factory priorities for dampening.

Recommendation: (until I figure a way to rebuild the old cores)
    go with this

If synthetic oil was not good for air-cooled engines, Porsche would

The best transmission fluid probably depends on the transmission. For a

  Wait a minute!!!

  In the Spec. book for 914's it says the air flow is rated at ** 800 **
liters per second at 4600 rpm.  Only a fraction of that is used for the
oil cooler.  The ducting and control flap around the cooler determine that.

  The fact is 914's have cylinders and heads closely resembling those
found on motorcycles...AIR cooled motorcycles.
  The majority of heat generated in an engine is centered around the
combustion chamber.  Valves, heads, and connecting hardware take the brunt
of the heat...these are all low-oil-flow areas with incidental contact, not
immersion, so not much engine heat is carried away.  In place of oil flow
for cooling is air flow of sufficient amounts to carry heat away under
a variety of conditions and load.
  The majority of the generated heat is exchanged into the airflow created
by the cage fan and the ducting around the cylinders.

  I just wanted to thank everyone for the messages concerning
  my new 993. I'm really looking forward to this weekend so I
  can get it out into the country & let it go.
  
  However, a lot of the messages I received concerned the cost
  of the car & I just wanted to set the record straight!
  
  The new 911 (993) has a sticker price of $59k for a base
  model before tax. With options, I don't mind telling you,
  mine came to about $64k before tax & before discount. Of the
  three people I know who've taken delivery of 993's none has
  paid sticker.
  
  I should say that we ordered the cars towards the end of '93
  & the discount situation may have changed. It may also be
  different from one area to another (I live in DC). I have
  heard that one of the local dealers recently sold a 993 at
  $5k over sticker so perhaps things have now changed.
  
  Also there is no gas guzzler tax on this car.

I believe there are many on this list who would claim otherwise and in fact
claim that the benefits of synthetic are even more important in hot running
air-cooled engines. After all, Porsche ships 911's with synthetic oil. The
latest issue of excellence has an interesting article comparing synthetic to
mineral oils. This article does not mention lower heat removal with
synthetics: anyone know if this is true and if so why.

so yea, i guess it was a 4-valve head, technically speaking, but that was
for 2 cylinders... :-).

bmw, honda,  moto-guzzi, and probably some other mfr. have made aircooled four
valve heads, but there were all individual cyclinders, either singles 
or opposed
and V-shaped twins. putting 4v/cyl heads right next to one another 
probably leads
to heat control problems, but:

there are, however, some 4cyl, 16v motorcycles out there that are air-cooled.
suzuki built some in the mid-80s, and yamaha still builds the FJ1200, which
is 16v i believe. it can be done, its just that by the time most folks 
get to that
level of complexity, the water jacket and pump and etc. looks pretty good

Derek,
From a chemical point of view, I find it very hard to believe that there are
significant differences in either the heat capacity or heat transfer rates
of "dino" oil vs. synthetics.  The molecular structures aren't all that 
different for the various components and my guess is that the additives are
pretty much the same, too.  The major differences, from what I have read, 
seems to be that the synthetics are derivatives of long-chain fatty acids,
whereas, the "dino juice" lacks the polar ends.  This should not lead to
major, functional differences that will show up under engine operating
conditions, IMHO.  I would want to see some experimental data before
concluding there were significant differences for air-cooled engines.

I have been using Mobil 1 15W-50 in my 911SC for 3 years and
have not noticed any oil temperature change from regular oil.
Assuming that the motor is producing the same HP/heat, I think
the heat absorbing nature of the oil must be the same or very
similar.

Also, I am using amsoil 10W-30 in my VW Jetta with a digital
oil temp guage and have not noticed any change in oil temp as
well.

Isn't Porsche putting synth oil in their new cars at the factory?

Subject: Re: '71 911T Questions

I have a '70T sunroof coupe just so you know where my comments come
from.  No matter what have a professional check out the car.  I
have put lots of money in mine even tho I did this.

10K is on the high side for this model.  Personally tho, I would pay
the high dollars for a quality car (and sunroof coupes are rare in this
series Porsche period) that gets a good bill of health.  Several
thousand dollars can disappear quickly in repairs, engine or trans
work, interior work, etc.  You want real dollars, write back.  I'm
spending money in ALL these areas.

The "E" cams should make the engine rev higher, a little quicker.  An
"E" in '71 would have had mechanical injection in addtion to the hotter
cams, among other engine changes.  A co-worker has a '70T that I believe
has "E" cams.  His engine revs freer and seemingly quicker, but my car
has I think more low end grunt.  I believe that the change was worth doing,
but each car might perform better at different rpm's.  We are still
both running Zenith carbs, btw.  Also, a T would redline at 6300, an
E at 6800.

This is a neat vintage series Porsche.  People buy them for two reasons.
One, is because they like the series and the nostalgia.  You realize that
many of today's cars are faster, but you don't care.  Thats me.  I bought
this car on PURPOSE.  Money was not the real issue.  Two, they are one
of the cheapest 911's around, and some people gotta have a Porsche.  They
can afford to buy one, but not to care for one (that's the guy I bought
my car from....)  They are more interested in status than class.  This
type of person will be disappointed in this series car.

The T is neat because it is probably the least finicky of the series.
My car is a daily driver, my goal is to make it one of the nicest
drivers around.  I *like* the noise, accept the performance, *love*
the ride, and think that this is the most attractive of the 911 series.
(do I sound like a proud parent, or what).  Of course, I also like
Corvairs so I may have some mental problems as well....

If this car is nice, I'd go for it.  I think that the replica may be a
tough beast to sell.  Most people that like them are do-it-yourselfers
who want to build their own, or people who want a GREAT deal.  If you
want $10K, people who are willing to spend that kind of money have
lots of options.  If you want a 911 and would be happy with this
series car, this sounds like a good deal for both of you.

Let me know, I have three friends with '70-71 911Ts, we can share
info.

good luck-
Mark

Just first glance s__t:
Bruce Anderson, in Porsche 911 Performance Handbook, states:
"Because of the low compression of this configuration [European Carrera
90mm pistons(2.7 Carrera RS) and cylinders], I recommend the 911T camshaft
grind.  I have done this conversion with both the 911T and 911E cans.  The
911E cams do produce more peak horsepower, as you would expect.  The 911T
cams, however, provide a much broader torque curve.  The subjective
seat-of-the-pants results definitely favor the 911T cams."

These are some of his recommendations for the 2.2 liters.  Not sure about
your particular motor, but might prove useful...

Subject: Re: '51 Cabriolet

Hi, Dan.
 
If the rust on the closing panels is only 3 inches up, no prob. You make a
patch out of 22 gauge steel and butt-weld it in. If there are stiffening
ribs on those early cars and the rust gets as high as those, you may be
better off buying a repro replacement panel and cutting a patch.
 
I have a really neat way of doing this. I use a German-made saw, brand name
Fein, with a thin steel blade. This round saw blade just oscillates, it
doesn't spin. You can even hold the blade while it's working. The same
principle is used for saws that cut plaster casts off but don't go through
skin. Anyway, I cut the rust out. Then I lay a piece of replacement stock
over the hole and trace. Then I cut and trim until the patch just barely
fits in the hole. I use clamps like those sold by Eastwood, but I made my
own, to hold the patch in while I make LOTS of tiny tack welds with a gas
torch. The clamps can be made from 1" square steel tubing, some flat steel
stock (I am now using 0.015" spring steel), some bits of 1/4-20 threaded
rod, and some wing nuts. If you get the Eastman catalog, you know what I
mean, but I didn't want to pay $8 a clamp. I made 12 of my own. OK, now with
the thing rigidly tacked in, you just weld all around and grind flush and
you're done. This is EASY bare-metal repair. Floors and longitudinals are
much more difficult.
 
If you want to get serious about this, you should join the 356 Registry.
They have had an ongoing series, with excellent drawings, on how to weld
different things in there.
 
$4500 is probably OK, depending on how much of a roach it is. <g>
 
(Later) I talked to Brett Johnson, author of the 356 Restorer's Guide to
Authenticity. He feels $4500 is a steal, as long as you don't plan on
driving it much and it's fairly complete. He says that as a collector car it
may be worth as much as 75K restored. (That's right, 75, not 7.5). Note that
much later Cabriolets can be had fully restored for much less money; this is
a very early car, the first year they built cabriolets in Stuttgart according
to the Conradt book. Conradt says they built less than 200; Brett Johnson
counted them up and it's closer to 300 according to his list. Note emphasis
on collector; it's not a very good driver. And to be worth a lot, it will
have to be restored perfectly. And you would have to find somebody willing
to pay that much money for what, in its day, was basically a hot rod VW
Beetle built by an unknown company struggling to survive. They built 1069
cars that year.
 
I hesitate to tell you "grab this car, it's a steal." It may be, but a car
that old, with its parts supply problems and really low performance, doesn't
push my buttons, and my gut feeling is that there's no way this thing can be
worth as much or more than a Speedster or rough Carrera coupe. But it may
push somebody else's hot buttons.

  I'm not sure, but I think the Weissach was only for the US market.  What I
do remember is there were 500 and they came in metalic black and (excuse the
spelling) Paungy Beige, which was a smoked silver sometimes called platinum.
It was an anniversary car for the track.  They all had cork interior with
blood red piping, 7&8x15" 'platinum' wheels and the only option was a posi
rear.  All were sunroof coupes with spoilers and duck tails, as a copy of
the '75 Carrera.  They didn't have auto heat and I don't know when they
started offering in.  My '81 SC does have it, which may have been the 1st
year - and, like most, it doesn't work.
    A friend of mine bought one new and I talked to him tonight.  He filled
in the gaps in my memory - of course, we are both aging so this is all

  Alex, sorry this probably wont reach you in time (and it is likely of
little use anyway)  but here are my recollections of the plumbing on my 
73 2.0.

  The fuel system is a complete circuit in which the fuel tank is a part
sorta like a battery..?? I know, weird.  The fuel is taken from the tank
and passed to the pump which raises the pressure to around 35psi, as 
controlled by the regulator.  Any fuel that is not immediatly used by
the engine in the injector loop is bypassed by the regulator back to the
tank.  The 'damper' is the output of the pump and is in the regulator 
circuit along with the injectors and the damper (which smooths the pump's
impulses from the injectors).
  The fuel filter is in the suction line/side of the pump, the return is
just that -back to the tank.  The to/from function is done at the pump.
  The tank return line is shared by the regulator out and pump return.

  Hope this was of use...it's out of the factory manuals.
  Good luck dude.

  I made the mistake of trying Castrol Syntac oil in the transmission of
my 912.  After some weeks (not many miles really) the shifting became
nearly impossible.  I really had to lean hard on the shifter to get it
into gear.  Then I read Duane Spencer's Performance 356 book who (pp. 89)
cites the experience of 3 LA Porsche transmission 'experts' who 
recommend not using the stuff.  These 3 had used various brands and all
experienced symptoms like mine.  Evidently, they hypothesize that the
synthetic is too slippery for the synchronizer rings and slider sleeves to
work well together.  
  I just found a source of SWEPC around these parts, but will probably
replace the snychros and re-seal the transmission before pouring in this
liquid gold. Note that having replaced the Castrol with the old Kendall Gold
Star, I'm not having the problem that I did have with the synthetic.

    Greetings Porshce Fans-

    A few weeks ago there was some discussion on painting helmets and
    that some of you thought better not to do it.  I posted a note
    that, as I recalled, my helmet manufacturer gave directions on
    painting the helmet and that if I ever found those directions, I
    would post them here.  Well, I still have not found those
    directions, but yesterday I bought a new Simpson (LX-5 open face)
    helmet and it included directions for painting the helmet.  Here
    is what it says:

    "For painting, use 320 grit sand paper to rough up the surface.
    Sand evenly unitl all the shine is removed.  Paint with only
    acrylic enamels.  Lacquer is not compatible.  If disassembly is
    necessary, send it back to the factory for reassembly.  Avoid any
    solvent or paint contact with the innerliner.  It may reduce
    helmet performance."

    As I recall, the directions for painting my other helmet (Bell
    Vetter) were similar.  I hope this helps.

springs etc., etc). If you really want to be cautious have a
compression leak down test done by a shop you trust.

Repainting can be used to lovingly restore the car`s exterior or hide a
multitude of sins (rust and bondo). Bring a magnet with you and test for
bondo everywhere you can reach (including the chassis). Closely examine
the door, bonnet and rear deck gaps for proper fit and symmetry. You
should also feel the top lip of all four well wells. If the fenders are
original there will be a rough feeling to the paint. Watch out for
recent chassis undercoating which can be used to cover up rust.

The 71E is reported in road test atricles from the period to do 0-60
in 7.6 seconds. This time agrees with the 71 911E owners' manual. If
the car screams you should be able to to 0-60 in less than 8 seconds.
I am told E cams are the best for the 2.2 l motors.

Any photos that document the restoration (motor and paint) will be very
important in helping to convince you you are not buying someone else`s
maistakes and troubles. I feel $10K is reasonable if the resotoration
was properly done.

Good luck!

I could look at an old toyota or something, but I'm tired of driving
simple transportation vehicles.  In the Minneapolis area, I can regularly
find '78 or '79 924's in decent shape and with 80,000+ miles.  Also, I can
find older 914's with 1.7L or possibly 1.8L engines in the same approx.
$2500 price range.  Would either of theses types of cars be acceptable for
daily driving at this price?  Which would be better?  What years are
better?  Options?  I would want the car to reliably get me to work five
days a week, with very little money stuck into it after the intial

  Agreed, another method is filling the spaces with inert gas such as that
used in gas MIG or TIG welding.  This would also enhance the welding process
and reduce chance of ignition.  I dont like the idea of welding a tank with
water in it..perhaps sand, but then you're getting into a cleanup job..and
a lot of weight.
  IT only takes a couple months of aeration to de-fume a tank after
stripping the hardware out.  Leaving it outdoors in the sun helps.

Close Bill, but not quite.  There were 400 cars built, 200 Metallic Black
with Platinum Metallic wheels, 200 all Platinum Metallic.  The interior
color was called Doric Grey and is not quite the same as the cork

Hi, Jim.
 
The engine Donohue refers to was a flat 16, not a flat 18. I think they
built three prototypes. One is on display in the Porsche museum. I think one
is still in a prototype 917 PA racer, which Porsche still owns but is not
usually on display. See Ludvigsen, p. 700-702. Ludvigsen says they made
parts for ten engines, and built 2 or 3.
 
Development of the flat 16 was stopped when it became apparent that a turbo
flat 12 would do the job in Can-Am. The flat 16 did not have a unique type
number. It was closely based on the Type 912 (!) of the 917 race cars.

Right. You have to look at the crank. The Ferrari 512 BB (Berlinetta Boxer)
is actually misnamed for marketing reasons; it's a V12 with 180 degrees
between the cylinder banks.
 
(Later) never mind, John Lupien pointed that out too.
 
Also note that a "horizontally opposed" engine is not the same as a boxer;
that just describes the physical layout. The Ferrari is horizontally opposed
but not a boxer.
 
I'm looking at the chapter in a standard engine textbook, "The Internal
Combustion Engine in Theory and Practice" by C.F. Taylor, MIT Press, Vol 2
chapter 8. There's a table in there of engine configurations and their
inherent balance. For 12 cyl opposed the book gives a flat
V12; opposite pistons are on the same crankpin. So if #1 is at top dead
center, #2 on the other side is at bottom dead center. Still, we know that 4
and 6 cylinder boxers are theoretically perfectly balanced for primary and
secondary forces and moments, so by inference the 8 and 12 boxers are also.
 
The flat V12 is also perfectly balanced, as are the two given configurations
of 60-degree V12s.
 
There are two flat-8 configurations given, neither a boxer. One is perfectly
balanced, with a flat crank, and fires two cylinders simultaneously, with a
firing interval of 180 degrees. The other has a two-plane crank, is
unbalanced for primary moments, and fires every 90 degrees.
 
Porsche had problems with their flat-8 racing engines in the 908 of the
late 1960s, until they changed the firing order and eventually the crank.
The vibration level was so high that things used to shake themselves apart.
The original 2-plane crank (note- that makes it a non-boxer, like the
two-plane flat-8 of Taylor's book, with its unbalanced primary moments)
was subject to
vibrations, even when they tried a different firing order. What's
interesting is that they got a different firing order without changing the
crankshaft OR THE CAMSHAFTS -- they just turned the cams on one side of the
engine by 180 degrees relative to the other, to change which cylinder got TDC
on its compression stroke after #1 on the other side fired, stuck the
plug wires on the appropriate towers of the distributor, and tried that
firing order. The third variation was a flat crank, which was inherently
smoother but the drivers felt it lacked power. This must have been
psychological ("It's not rough so it must be less powerful") but their lap
times weren't any worse so that's what they ran as of Sebring in 1969.
(See Paul Frere, "The Racing Porsches", p. 142-143; Ludvigsen, p. 536).

Subject: 4 valve heads



    Does anybody know anything abouts Porsche's early experiments with
  4 valve heads ? I know they tried this in the early 70s, the only blurb
  I saw was that power was too peaky. One disadvantage with 4-valve heads
  (or enormous-2-valve heads, or long duration cams, etc) is low rpm usage
  means very low intake velocity, poor atomization of the fuel etc. Since
  then the Corvette ZR-1 (and several other machines, probably started with 
  Bikes in the 80s) use separate intake runners for the 'other' intake valve,
  so that at low RPMs only 1 intake valve is effective and the intake runners
  for the 2nd intake valve are used at high RPM. Another scheme involves 
  quick-bleed hydraulic lifters on the 2nd intake valve, much like the 
  "Rhoads" lifters used to dynamically change effective duration of a 
  fixed cam profile.    
    On Ford 351 Clevelands and the similarly-valved 302 Bosses, the intake
  valve size of 2.19" and the huge ports cause poor low-rpm performance
  (i.e. anything below 4krpm), dirt-trackers prefer the "small" 2.04" 
  2-barrel heads and rapid-ramp roller cams to get any power band.

Well, from what I understand about synthetics, it's bad to use them in air
cooled engines, since they don't absorb heat like normal oil (necessary for 
proper cooling of a 911/912/914/VW engine). 
 
[stuff deleted]

The bad thing about synthetics is that if you are running an oil
temperature gauge, everything will appear to be fine and dandy because
the oil will never get that hot--the most it will do is reflect the
temperature of the surrounding engine.  If you had a cylinder head
temperature gauge, I'll bet that it would show a far higher temperature
than normal for your car (since it only has the air to cool it).

 -Derek
- ----- End Included Message -----

A temperature reduction from sythetic oil observed on the temperature
gauge has to be a real reduction... otherwise you violate the laws of
thermodynamics (all temperatures must come to equilibrium). If natural
oil causes the head to be a certain temperature above the oil
temperature - let's say the difference between the oil and head is 15
deg. -, the synthetic oil must also have the same temperature
difference once the system (fluid and metal) reachs equilibrium (say
after driving at 4000 RPM for 30 minutes). If the thermal conductivity
of synthetic oil is less than natural oil, the temperatures will take
longer to reach equilibrium, but certainly the temperature difference
between the head and the oil can not be different (unless the
conductivity is zero!) after equilbrium is obtained. The rate in
temperature rise and fall might be misleading compared to the actual
head temperature if the thermal conductivity (easy to measure BTW) is
significantly different between natural and synthetic oil.

Otherwise you have just found the first known violation of the laws of
thermodynamics. In this case you should follow this up as you will
certainly win the Nobel prize and open up an entire new area of
science.

On the other hand, it is reasonable to assume the temperature decrease
comes from the reduction in friction available by the use of synthetic
oil. In this case less heat energy is generated by the engine bearings
and the temperature of the engine is (once equilbrium is reached)
reduced. If the friction could be reduced to zero for instance, the
engine would run much cooler. The main cause of wear is heat. Heat
causes disorder which increases the odds the shape of the metal will
change and that metal-metal chemical bonds can be broken and liberate
random ensembles of metal. If you think all the heat in your engine
comes from combustion, then why does the transmission become quite hot
as well (no..not because it is near the exhaust pipe!)?

OK, I'm convinced now that I need to upgrade my Boge/KYB shock combo to Koni

assume I'll be pushing harder so I'll 'need' to upgrade to Konis, strut tower 
brace, harnesses, Autothority chip, bigger sway bars...anything else?  I have 
a K&N filter already. 

Any thoughts as to the recommended order of 'upgrades' with biggest bang for 
my buck? 

The other thought I have is to sell my low-mileage (41K) 951 and get a 951S 
which may already have the performance goodies before putting more money into

Does anyone have option codes/std equipment on '88 and '89 951S? Reliability

This is sort of a netiquette issue, but, the recent exchange on heat

could cite references when they state a fact or opinion, so that readers
can judge how likely the statement is to be true.  "IMHO" is the
standard disclaimer and performs this function well.  Others might range
from "I'm a polymer chemist and I have measured the specific heats of
xxx..." or "I'm the factory engineer who specified the 911 synthetic
oil" (100 points each!), to "Joe Blow who builds race engines for Team
XYZ told me he measured..." (50 points?), down to "the guy at the chain
autoparts store told me" (10 points) or "the car salesman told me" (0
points).  "From what I hear..." doesn't impress me without knowing a lot
more about who you are, and not much even then.

They are externally adjustable both in front and rear using a special

The 356 (yes it is supposed to be a speedster) broke down again. Dylan got 
sick of it, so he went looking for another car, he bought a '93 911 (C2 I 
believe) which was car-jacked, so he was indeed looking for the 911 when he 
got to the impound yard. The 356 got back up on it's feet and runs again. 
(His mechanic told him the car was too old to be a daily driver, and 
interestingly enough Dylan replied "But it's not like I race her 
anymore...." hmm more shades of Jame's Dean huh?)

Anyway the car is not really a speedster, there was an article in Car and

cars for movies, and shows, this place built the Waynes World 2 Pacer limo, 
etc... That shop did a conversion from a coupe to a roadster for the show. I

    I confess that in the dead of winter when the car is away, Pano
    has been read and Excellence has yet to arrive, I too might turn
    on the idiot box (and just to see the Speedster [I am pretty sure
    that is what it is]) I will watch 90210.  As far as Dylan's
    mis-identification, I think you might have missed a show or two:
    Dylan either temporarily traded in or simply bought a 911 which
    was jacked from him on some street in L.A.  So, at least this time
    the writers were not mistaken.

This seems to be a common problem.  The oil drips onto the exhaust from the the oil
drain in the airbox.  And yes, it does only occur when you overfill your oil.  You
can redirect the drain by stiking a hose in there and routing the hose so that oil
drips on the ground.

Hi,

my 944 clock's lack of illumination problem 
was fixed 2 weeks ago in New York. I was going
around Manhattan and the car suddenly hit a gigantic 
pot hole. At the instant of the blow, the clock illuminated
with a gorgeous amber light. Since then, its working perfectly.

So, maybe it's a long shot but try the therapeutic pot holes 
right after Lincoln Tunnel going towards Manhattan!
It fixed my 2 year old problem for free.

Subject: Re: HELP - NO OIL PRESSURE 

Well the oil pressure problem has been solved.  My mechanic (DM 
Motors in Palo Alto) said that the o-ring was missing from the oil
pressure relief valve.  The theory is that when the oil pump lost
its prime during the oil change, it was not able to regain it due
to air leaking past the pressure relief valve and back into the crank
case.  How come the o-ring was missing?  I had the seals in the oil
intercooler replaced last December.  To get to the oil intercooler
the pressure relief valve is removed.  I guess the mechanic (Carlseon
Porsche that time) neglected to put a new o-ring in.

So in the end it was a $170 oil change.   Hopefully no damage was done
to the engine for the 1000 revolutions it turned with zero oil pressure.

Subject: 911 Shocks & Shiftboot

I changed the shocks on my 87 911 Carbrio to Koni adjustables (red). How do I 
adjust them ? I know the mechanics of this but do I dial them stiffer in the 
back than the front ? Equal ? or does this depend on some other parameters ?

Question #2: the 87 911 have a shiftboot that comes only halfway up the stick. I 
once ordered the Agla 959 style boot-knob combination but sent it back because
	1. It was poorly made
	2. Looked very cheap
	3. Had the wrong shift pattern on the knob.
Any suggestions for either the 959 style or full style leather boot ?

Thanks, Bart

Regarding the engines of the Porsche 908: Correction to self. The final
crank configuration was not a flat crank, but rather two flat-fours end to
end, 90 degrees out of phase (if the first four crankpins were laid

If it were a flat crank, you would have to fire two pistons simultaneously.

Subject: DIN Curb Weight

QUESTION: What is the criteria for DIN Curb Weight and how would it differ
from, say, the Curb Weight quoted for an american car.

The PCA Club Racing rule book says my car should have a minimum weight of
2195 lbs.  That is the least amount the car can weigh when it is impounded
*AFTER* a race.  No mention here of DIN or SAE or Curb, just a flat
statement as to how little the car can weigh.

The Owners Manual says the car has a DIN Curb Weight of 2075 lbs.

At the Las Vegas race, the scales were available during the day for those
folks who were curious.  I was and the car, with a 1/2 tank of fuel,
weighed 2163 lbs.  This is 88 lbs more than the factory stated weight which
is probably explained by the fact that the car has a rollbar and auxiliary
oil cooler installed.  The astonishing part, to me, was that the car was
some 32 lbs under the allowed racing weight.  (Luckily, they only weighed
the top two finishers in each class so I didn't have to face the specter of
disqualification).  :-)

Since the car runs in a Stock Class, I am not allowed to remove any
components except the spare tire and floor mats.

I am in the process of writing a letter to the Rules Committee and the
thought occurred to me that I should get some input from the experts on the
"net".

Any ideas?

Sorry to pop your balloon Ryan but you can't join the club for $2500
and expect to maintain your Porsche for the price of a Honda.  There
is no very cheap Porsche out there that won't cost you a nice tidy
sum getting and keeping it going.  I would guess any of the candidate
cars would cost you at least that much every year in maintenance,
and that you'd be very disappointed in its reliability.

If it's just for the summer you'll be better off with a Japanese
econobox you can turn around and sell for the price you paid.  Some
of them can even be fun!  I had an 84 CRX that was a blast to drive.
At the time it was R&T's top performing production car through
100' slalom cones at 64.2 mph.

How 'bout a motorcycle?  Great summer fun!

I solved half of my Porsche problems by recently buying a black '88
Carrera.  Now I need to address the other half by selling my '76 911S.
Surely someone wants a perfectly good Porsche to put a new engine in
or practice your engine rebuilding skills on?  I was considering
trying it myself, but with our house on the market and another child
due this summer, it didn't seem quite the right time to take on the
project.

Silver with black interior

187,000 miles
9,000 miles on top-end rebuild


Plusses:

Lots of new engine parts (from top-end rebuild or newer):
  New pistons & cylinders
  New valve train components (exhaust valves, chains, etc.)
  New clutch
  New injectors
  New warm-up regulator
  New windshield
Inexpensive


Minuses:

Head stud pulling, the standard 2.7 liter motor problem

Date: Fri, 22 Apr 94 23:08:41 EDT
From: "Rick Dill" <dill1@watson.ibm.com>
Subject: Why Four Valves

Internal combustion engines are restricted by the pressure drops
in the air/fuel mixture reaching the engine.  This is particularly
evident at high RPM and full throttle.  Assuming two valves of
equal diameter (not usually the choice), then the diameter of each
valve is half the cylinder diameter (neglecting the combustion
chamber dome).  With 4 valves, each valve is roughly 20% smaller,
but there are two for intake and two for exhaust.

Since the valves don't open very far, the restriction to flow is
dependent upon the periphery of the valve and the amount the valve
is opened.  A four valve cyinder has approximately 1.6X the
periphery of a two valve cylinder.  This is a significant advantage
at high rpm.

Additionally, since the individual valves are lighter, they can
be opened wider and/or run to higher RPM before floating.

The increase in mechanical complexity of double overhead cams has
been mostly negated by rubber toothed timing belts which are much
more reliable than chains or gears (up to the day they break).  With
twin cams (per cylinder bank), the valve train is actually simple and
seldom requires adjustment.

On the other hand, as has been pointed out .. it is harder to air
cool four valve cylinders because much more of the top surface is
covered with machinery where you really would like fins.  Many of
the new motor cycle engines are showing up with liquid cooling,
particularly for the heads.

If you supercharge, you can blow away any pressure drops, so two
valves work just as well.

Many of us dispaired when air pollution stuff went on, compression
and octanes went down.  In spite of that some of the best car engines
today get near 100 BHP per liter which is better than they any got
before we had restrictions.  I did have a two stroke racing bike that
turned out about 200 BHP per liter, peaking at about 13,000 rpm.

This is perfectly normal. While I was working for Bosch in Germany, I took
my new '81 SC in to the factory for routine maintenance. At the first visit, I
mentioned the clicking noise coming from behind the speedo. They replaced
the speedo, but the noise was still there. I didn't complain about it after
that, but I think somebody noticed at the next service and they replaced the
speedo again. This happened two or three times, all under warranty. It turns
out that there is a counter in there to turn on a red light labelled OXS or
something like that, to remind you to replace the oxygen sensor at 30,000
miles or whatever it is. The clicking is the counter and, like the mechanics
like to say, "they all do that." The factory was not familiar with the US
models and the catalyst of that time, so their service guys didn't know about
the counter and figured it must be some problem with the speedo.
 
Bottom line -- don't worry about it.

I read an article in one of the car mags about this car.  Actually
the article was about the place that supplies cars for the 
movies and shows.

The car was actually a coupe, not a speedster, which was in pretty
sorry shape ( there were b4 and after pictures ), and I am
fairly confident that restorative accuracy was not a concern at the 
time, because the guy that made the car said that he was insructed
to do it reasonlably cheaply, because they were not sure that the 
show was going to make it or not.  

Incidentally, the same guy did the car for "wayne's world", and
there was an anecdote about how he bought the car for the second
movie.  The person that he was buying the car from made some comment
like "This car will be worth something because I heard they're making
a Wayne's World 2 and they are going to need cars like these", not
realizing who he was selling the car to.

If you are really interested I can look in my back issues to
find the article.

The ONLY way to get at the little bugger is to remove the

this is a real pain as the climate control knobs are hell
to get off and might break ($600 mistake).  there
The climate control cover is snap on.  Behind
that plate there are two screws holding on the right side cover
and there are also screws behind the little air intake grill
(witch comes off with a camera lens fassion)
there is also scres near the door side behind yet another
cover on the right side of dash.

once you get all those damn cover off your ready for a couple

OK know ya can see the clock and the bulb holder on the side
of it whithin a plastic cover.  check the bulb and wiring
ect.

BE VERY CAREFULL TO RE-ALIGN THE BULB for proper illumination
and that it would move.  

Now put all those bloody panels back in place.

Subject: oxygen sensor

Charlie is having trouble with 'surging' during accel and wonders 
if it might be a Lambda Sensor problem.

__
I'mm not sure what you mean by surging but I know if you
have low octane fuel in the tank you can get a nasty effect
while accelerating (in my 85 951 anyway)
While under heavy load or high boost the engine can detonate/knock
and the computer will adjust timing to prevent this.
	And when the DME/Knock control changes the timing t
it feels like the engine is hesitating or loosing steam
This is especially noticable when accelerating.

If the Oxy sensor is old it is probably 'lazy'
that is it responds slowly to exaust O2 content.
This might cause odd
behavior while idlying especially when the engine is
 'cold'

If the Lambda is dead the DME will most likely go
fail safe into open loop control ie. the factory
default stttings in ROM.
If it is shorted out I dont know I'll guess
that Bosch considered this and allows it to go to 
open loop. (closed loop=signal from Lambda is used
as input to control system)

Couple of possibilities.  It may be that you have a bad master cylinder
seal.  With vacuum disconnected, no problem.  But when connected, the
vacuum in the booster is sucking fluid from the MC, past its seal.
Remove the MC from the booster, and check in the booster for brake fluid.

You may just have a little air in the brakes.  A lot of times, a little
air will result in a pedal which feels OK with the car turned off (and
so no vacuum), but feels really soft when the car's running.

Whoever had this problem, make sure you're using the right heat range
of spark plug -- 7's for all 944-series, except the 944S2 which can
use 5's or 7's.  This sort of problem might happen if you overheat
the ceramic insulator.

The reason a lot of people don't like the platinum plugs is that they
cost three to four times what the copper ones do, they foul more easily,
and they have no performance advantage.  I'd stick with WR7DC's.

Charlie,

Surging on accel doesn't strike me as a classoc oxygen sensor problem.
If you told me that you had a problem with decel, ie, foot off the gas,
then I'd agree with the o-sensor hypothesis.

Try unplugging the oxygen sensor, and go for a drive.  See whether the
problem persists.  If not, it isn't the oxygen sensor.

There is no really good test for a bad sensor.  You can easily diagnose
one which is completely broken.  However, there's no test for one which
is getting old and slow.  In your case, after 100K miles, I'd say it's
time.

I replaced mine yesterday, after 70K miles on it.  Symptoms were slow and
uncertain return to idle on decel, occassional stalling.  We replace it,
and the problem seems to be solved.  (I'll be a little more definite
when I get a few more miles, esp. in damp weather.)

DIN curb weight is defined by the standard DIN 70020. It includes:
filled and charged battery
lubricants
brake fluid
coolant
standard tool kit
and at least 90 percent of a full tank of fuel. No driver, no luggage.
 
The German rules of the road (the Strassenverkehrszulassungsordnung),
Section 42, deviate from this in determining curb weight by
specifying a full tank of fuel, jack, other equipment required by law such
as headrests and seat belts, and a warning triangle and first aid kit.
 
For anything EXCEPT passenger cars and motorcycles, StVZO 42 also requires a
fire extinguisher, standard spare parts kit, wheel chocks and a 75 kg
allowance for the driver.

Kelso Resources of Vancouver claims F1 technology in the design of the
air cooled P4V heads. According to the article have tests shown 30% more
power and additional torque. It is possible to retrofit the P4V heads to
all 911 applications from 2.2 to 3.8 litres including C2 and C4 models.

The Kelso kit includes the heads, gaskets and cam box. The standard cams
can be used. No indication of the price at this point.

It would be interesting to know how durable the engine will be with these
heads and if the engine gets too "peaky" for every day usage...

Depending on the quality of your engine oil, hopefully you've just put some 
'xtra mileage' on your car. We ran an experiment on a beetle engine that had

up to normal operating temperature, drained the oil, restarted the old

Thanks to everyone for your responses on the clock light.  It turned out
to be fairly easy to remove the dash panel.  It took a bit of dexterity
to get the hose to the temperature sensor back on during installation.
In my case, the filament was gone so the pothole trick wouldn't have
helped.  Besides, since I left Pittsburgh I haven't seen many world-class
potholes.

On another subject, Sunday was mounts and belts day.  Thanks to the
manual and many interesting and informative posts from the 'philes both
jobs went very smoothly and without any anxiety attacks.  The mount took
about two hours and the belts another three.  The belt time included
several practice runs with the old belt to learn the technique of
threading it behind the tensioning device.  I found there was plenty of
room with the piece slipped forward to the end of the stud.  If anyone
is interested in all the gories send me a direct request.

One more question - the next time I go in it will probably include a
water pump (75,000 miles now) and that will require removal ot the
tensioning device.  Does anyone know how to get that sucker off (and,
even more important, get it back on)?  Is there a special tool for
compressing the spring?

Incidently, the belts I replaced had 44,000 miles on them and did not
show any danger signs (i.e., cracking, missing teeth, and so on).

Thanks again,

I unfortunatly have to leave my car in the sunlight much more than I would like
to.  The sun has taken it's toll on leather seats.  The car is an 89 and the
drivers seat is already starting to crack.  I have tried to keep plenty of sunblock on the leather but it seems of no use.  I heard of a product this weekend 
called Lexol(?).  Is  the stuff any good and where can I find it for sale. I
live in the Atlanta, GA area.  Are there some other products or care tips I
should know about?  Thanks for any advice.

Barney,


As you may remember at the Club Race RMR put on last year several cars were
disqualified due to weight problems in stock cars. I believe that the weights
used by club racing are Porsche Specs. As we all know specs are only as good
as the data used to write them and are generally stated as typical. This 
doesn't mean that all cars will meet them 100% of the time. Also I believe 
that the spec weight for Porsches includes a full tank of gas, spare tire 
and tool kit. As we all know no one races in a 10 lap race with a full 
tank of gas or with the other items. If you decide to challenge the weight
spec you have my full support.

Steve:

I've have done all the things you suggest to my '86 951 including the K&N
filter.

Without question the biggest bang for your buck is the Autothority Stage II
chip set.  However, and if you can afford it, the Autothority mass flow kit
promises 300+ HP for the 951.  I hope to try one as soon as Autothority
gets their supplier problems sorted out.  In any case, I have been with
Stage II in my daily driver/auto-x/trial car for over 60K miles without
problems of any sort.  After that it's more a question of budget.

Next on my list of big ticket items woulld be tires.  I have used the older
series Comp T/A R1 and the more recently Yokohama A008 RS for competition.
I much prefer the Yokohamas.  If your car is a dual purpose machine, you
may want to invest in a set of wheels for your competition rubber and keep
your street Comp T/A's on the stock rims.  T/A's are hard to beat on
price/performance for street use and the sizes you suggest are as large as
you can go on stock 16" rims.  17" rims will allow a wider tire profile
which would be better for competition.

My stock 951 was very hard on front tires in auto-x, and suspension mods
are pricey if you don't do your own work because a lot of labor is
involved.  Fortunately it is something you can nibble away at as budget
permits.  Early on I replaced the stock front sway bar with a Porsche
non-adjustable 28mm anti-sway.  That helped a lot.  Later I  added an
adjustable 22mm Weltmeister sway at the rear.  Ideally you would like to
have both front and rear bars adjustable.  My front springs were replaced
with 250# units. Rear torsion bar is now 27mm.  I left suspension mods and
and replacement of suspension bushings with more resilient varieties to the
shop.

I have Koni "adjustables" all around.  The rear shocks are set at about
50%, and I adjust the front according to venue.  It would be simple for you
to replace your front springs when you do the shocks.  Depending upon your
supension, you may need bushings on the spring perches to compensate for
the shorter springs.

What else?  I have had serious brake fade with carbon kevlar brake pads.  I
replaced the stock front rotors with drilled rotors and added air
deflectors a la 968 to the A-arms to improve cooling.  So far this seems to
be a good thing although I now have to pay more attention to rotor cracks.

Though not legal on the street, a test pipe to replace the catalytic
converter will perk up turbo response at the track.

A strut brace is a must.  Do it any time, preferably before you get
serious.  You probably won't notice the difference it makes in normal
driving.

I am not an expert on the 951.  The above changes have made a great
difference in performance all around.  The car is reasonably comfortable on
good roads which prevail in Texas.  It's horrible on dirt and excruciating
on washboards. My wife hates it regardless so it can't be all bad.  Had I
not done all this stuff to a car that now has over 100k, the lure of a lo
mile 951S might prove irresistable.

I don't know exactly what the problem is, but just to be sure 
check the relay in the fuse box that controls the operation of
the sunroof. I had a similar experience, the cost of the relay
is about $200 and since it is still cold in Chicago I have not
had the urge to replaced it yet. 

I don't know the procedure for testing this relay, the shop I took
my car to, just swapped one from another 944 and Q.E.D. (Mind you,
I and the shop mechanic are on a friendly term, thus I was able
to observe the testing procedure).

except when the car was turned off. I then was able to push the clutch pedal in,
put the car in gear
and then start the car. Driving and shifting seeemed fairly normal, except that
shifting was a little difficult especially in second. When the car is in any
gear with the clutch engaged it wants to move.
Today, I almost didn't make it to my shop. Of course I had to always keep the
car in gear with the clutch in at all stops, but Shifting became VERY difficult.
The clutch pedal feels normal. The car has 91K (original clutch).  The car is in
the shop now, waiting to get cheked out.

   My power sunroof on my 86 944 gave up the ghost.  It stuck open during a rain
   storm, and i fumbled around madly to manually crank it down.   The open/close
   switch still activates the motor (I can hear it quite easily) but the roof
   doesn't budge.  I swapped the two relays connected to the motor assembly to
   no avail.  Since I can manually crank the roof open and closed, the cable
   must be okay.  Any ideas???  

I don't know how the 944 sunroof works (so I should probably just keep
my mouth shut until someone who knows comes along :-), but if it is
like the 911 then I would look at the little gearbox that transmits
the electic motor torque to the cables.  On my '76 911S the problem
was as simple as the screws that held the drive gear in place against
the cables coming loose.

Subject: Re:  Sunroof woes

This sounds familiar.  I've never had mine stick up, however.  

Here's what I found out.  A local PCA member also had the same problem
with his 86 944.  After checking everything else, he found that the micro
switch in the roof was bad.  This is behind the black trappiziod just
ahead of the center of the sunroof.  He figured this out by 'helping' the
switch with a very small screwdriver while operating the rocker switch 
to open the roof (the switch tells the system that the roof is in the
car and which way the latches should go).  Keith eventually replaced the
micro switch (big job, lots of interior to remove/replace) and all was
fine.

With my 86 944, things didn't get to where I was willing to take that 
much of the interior apart.  However, after removing the sunroof, I gained
access to the micro switch.  I removed the covers to the switch and cleaned
the contacts.  After some adjusting, I reassembled the switch and cover,
put the sunroof back in, and have been happy with it ever since.  

Or, you could move to California.... 8)

   What do you know about an 84 Carrera ? I just looked at one with 85k,

Sounds high.  I just bought an '88 Carrera with 70K miles for $26K.  I
looked at other '88 cars with asking prices around $28K.  I saw a
beautiful red/black '86 with a tail and only 50K miles for around $25K
(I might have bought that one, but my bank balked at lending on an
"old" car).

These were all private sales in the San Francisco penninsula area.
Dealers charge more.  Is the dealer including any kind of warranty?
If I remember right, the local dealers would add a comprehensive 1
year warranty for around $1,500, so if your price includes that you
may be in the right ballpark.

Ultimately you have to just compare with other cars in your area to
determine whether or not the price seems fair.

Seriously, though... I thought cam belts were on the "out" due to the
breakage problems (they even break in Hondas), chains (with quiet plastic

I experienced similar symptoms when the rubber center on

symptom that I had that you did not mention was that
the gear shift lever vibrated while the car drove.  This
was due to the clutch disk being out of balance.  If
you are unlucky enough to have this it means a new clutch
disk.  Since you already have 91K on the car you should
also replace the pressure plate and throw out bearing since
it takes so much time to get to the clutch.

I agree. It's very with the current involved with welding. I'm no welder.
I have a welder though and read alot. I've read alot of warning about 
damaging electical equip. while welding.

Subject:      944: Mystery Noise of the Week


    Car:  '87 944S
Symptom:  Single clunk noise in rear whenever the angle of the body of
          the car changes...such as going up a driveway at an angle, or
          making a right or left turn.  I can finally reproduce the
          noise by slowly driving down the street and making quick
          alternating left/right turns.  Sounds like something banging
          around in the spare tire well.  I've checked for loose items.
          Sometimes I hear the sound when getting out of the parked car,
          so I know its nothing loose like a tire or tool.
          I cannot reproduce the sound by rocking the car by a rear
          body panel.  I've checked under the car, nothing is loose.

Any ideas?  Could it be a shock?  I've got two Konis in the rear.
They are yellow. I assume these are the sport shocks.  And while
on that subject, how does one adjust these?

It's easy to get more power out of the 951 by increasing boost, which is  
primarily what the Autothority kit does.  However, their kits also blow  
head gaskets.  If you want to know why, call Jon Milledge Engineering at  
617 834-3932; his chips provide the same power increase without blowing  
head gaskets.

Their mass flow sensor claims are complete bunk.  An acquaintance of mine  
challenged their claims for the Carrera kit, and told them he'd pay for  
the kit if they could show any measurable increase on the dyno.  Turns out  
that their kit probably loses horsepower over stock (hard to tell, since  
they were playing games with the dyno), but the only measurable power  
increase came from the K&N filter included with their kit.  These you can  
buy for about $40.  Made sense to me:  you're not going to measurably  
improve volumetric efficiency simply by switching to an mass air flow  
sensor.  I wouldn't expect anything different for the 951 conversion.

Charles goes on:
>A strut brace is a must.  Do it any time, preferably before you get

>driving.

Strut braces alone don't make any measurable difference.  Track testing  
shows no significant deflection of the front strut towers (in that  
direction) within about .005" resolution.  Calculations show about 90 lbs  
of force trying to spread the towers under 1.5g cornering loads (you won't  
get that on street tires), which is insignificant.  If you triangulate  
from the strut towers back to a roll cage structure through the fire wall,  
the strut brace will improve torsional rigidity about 20% in combination  
with these extra bars, which will make a significant difference.

I have a very skeptical philosophy regarding aftermarket modifications.   
If you don't thoroughly understand the system in question yourself, and  
you aren't capable of the calculation necessary to ground truth a specific  
claim, then you're left playing a guessing game.  Information from a  
reliable source can help _if_ they have data to back themselves up, or are  
beyond technical reproach (unfortunately this excludes most of our sources  
of information, including much of Panorama and Excellence).  There are  
very few aftermarket mods that actually improve performance as much as  
claimed by the vendor.  If you can't measure the difference yourself (not  
just subjectively think you _feel_ the difference), don't waste your  
money, spend it on tires and seat time instead.

On the other hand, if you _think_ the mod made a significant difference, I  
guess it doesn't matter whether it really does....

One option for replacing the microswitch that circumvents messing with
the headliner, etc., is to simply desolder the wires from the old and
new switches, make the swap and solder the new one in, leaving the old
wires in place.

Unfortunately, I doubt that the microswitch is Reichard's problem,
since he says he can hear the motor running.  I believe that a bad
switch prevents the motor from running.

The main difference between the S and the S4 is that the S4 has 4 valves per
cylinder, whereas the S only has 2 valves per cylinder.  In terms of visible
differences, the S4 has a more rounded "bulb" shaped nose with the bumper hidden
under a plastic fascia.  As well, the S4 has a wing in the rear rather than the
simple lip-shaped spoiler that he S has. Of course, the S4 can also be
identified by the prominent model designation on the rear of the car.

The S4 replaced the S in the mid-1980s.

  Yah, I've welded tanks..never tried the dried ice.  How much volume does
a hunk of dry ice yield?  A 914 tank is only about 2 cubic feet volume..
  I'll add this to my repertoire...

  Uh, and for those of you watching, I was just inside Saga's center tunnel
making repairs to a clutch tube and bulkhead.  I can tell you all that there
is quite a bit of room within the tunnel on the *passenger* side.
  The shift rod, throttle and clutch cables run in carriers along the driver
side.  The wiring harness is above the floor of the tunnel, and the brake
line seems to snake close to the fuel lines which run along the passenger
side.  For these there are supports similar to the wire harness body tabs,
the brake lines get a slip of rubber tube over them for protection from 
vibration damage *very important*.
  The tunnel itself is around 6 inches wide at the floor and tapers as
it goes toward front.  There should be enough room to comfortably add
tubes or wires without dire consequence.

  Fuel lines in Saga (a '76 914 2.0) are all nylon from front to rear, with
cloth covered hose to make the flex connections.  On my '73, the fuel lines
are nylon only to about a third of the way forward from the rear, then
connect to yellow chromate'ed steel tubes.  The metal tubes extend out
the front of the fuel tank bay thru a big rubber grommet where flex hose
makes the final connects.  All fuel lines should be grommeted where they
penetrate a metal bulkhead.

Arggggg, I got 15 copies of this mail!

I assume you're refering to the aftermarket pronged crests that
you push through the original caps, and not the hubs caps
themselves.  They're a cheaper way of dressing up your wheels
than replacing or painting your caps, right?  I added them to my
wife's 89 coupe which had factory painted wheels (not annodized).
On my other 911's I've had the hub caps polished and painted (baked
enamel) which I think looks better.  But then you have to worry
about someone ripping off the entire cap.  Locks are available from
many places like Automotion or Performance Products.  They're
rings that are mounted from the back of the wheel and secured by
allen nuts.  Still, they didn't stop the thieves that attacked my 84
cab.  They just used lots more force, probably with a vice-grip-like
tool.  And damaged the wheels in the process.

I think the crests you are referring to are about $75 a set.  You
might try using a tap and die set to thread the prongs and secure
them with washers and nuts.  That should foil the bastards.  If I've
misread your message and you really are looking for the hub caps,
the same sources sell them for about the price you mentioned.

I've got 4 Porsche hubcaps, but the emblems are engraved in a dull 
aluminum.  They're in pretty good shape, but are too small for my BBS RS 
wheels, so I haven't put them back in.  The previous owner used tape and 
glue to hold them in, but it seems hokey, so I'm waiting to find a 
correct set.  I'll let them go for say 1/2 of what Automotion sells the 
for, which I think is $19 each.

One of the deciding factors in a friend's purchase of Infiniti Q45 over 
top of the line Lexus was use of chains rather than belts in the Infiniti.

Has anyone tried the temporary "link" belts sold by the Sharper Image 
clone company?  It's an emergency belt that can be adjusted to any length 
by taking out or adding links.  Would be interested to know if anyone has 
used one in a Porsche or 911.

I ordered (4) Fuchs wheel caps with epoxied crests for $120 from Imparts. 
Upon seeing how easily they attached/detached, I ordered (4) cap locks for

Subject: selling a 924; (or should I) and, a possible replacement

  Well folks, it is a pleasure to be back on the Porschephiles mailing
  list after a forced leave due to my Ph.D. thesis.  Unfortunately, in the
  last year, as I have sacrificed practically all parts of my life in order
  to graduate, my 1977 924 has accumulated more miles (up to 140 K now), and 
  has become more unreliable and cranky.  For example, I still get an 
  occasional backfire when I start it up, necessitating a trip under the hood
  with a screwdriver to remount the rubber top over the intake (where the 
  air sensor is located).  Minor things like the heater cables, etc. 
  are also causing me grief, and that pesky fuel leak when the fuel tank
  is filled still raises its head once in a while as well.  Without A/C, it
  could be another long, hot summer, and I'd like to take some long drives
  without worrying about the car. 
  
  As much as I have loved to drive and work on this car over the years, 
  I realize that I need to have a reliable car that can get me to work on
  time, and that can survive a Massachusetts winter.  The job that I have 
  does not pay *that* well, so I'm thinking of, yes, selling this car, and
  even buying a non-P car that can handle well in the snow, and not cost
  me too much in insurance.  
  
  So, for starters-
  
  Would anybody be interested in an aged 924 with admittedly, a few
  problems?  I've also got a zillion parts from a wrecked 924 that I used
  as a parts car for my beast, so you get an extra engine (with a good head),
  a 79 5-speed tranny, another rear hatch, and all sorts of sundry parts
  that would be good for someone who has a limited budget but a huge
  barn to store all this stuff in.  If I could find a place outside of
  Boston with a large enough barn for rent (Mike S, are you listening?),
  I could even keep the car, but the kind of work my car might need to 
  become reliable could be prohibitive in cost and time.
  
  Item two- any comments on anything else in a 924's performance/layout
  range?  I've looked into an Eagle Talon AWD, a Ford Probe, and even 
  (gasp) a Saturn SC2, but my heart is not in any of these cars.  Would
  I be putting myself in more trouble if I started looking for another
  later model (say, a 1988 924S)?  My budget is about 10-12K, and 
  I'm limiting myself to insurance payments of under $200/month.
  
  I hope this note does not conflict with the central theme of this list;
  Stan's warnings make me almost afraid to post!

========
Your posting read like a deja vu.  Except that this identical-sounding
problem occurred on my 84 cab.  It happened when turning up and into a
driveway, or on any sudden shift in weight, left or right, as in a jerked
turn at slow speed.  It would not happen twice in the same turning
direction.  And yes, sometimes (rarely) it happened just exiting the car,
but otherwise would not happen at rest.

After two years, many trips to several of the best shops and dealers in
the bay area, lots of experimenting with wheel bearings, torsion bars,
shocks, brakes, etc., letters to Bruce Anderson and PCNA, *everyone*
threw their arms in the air and said, "Don't worry about it; just enjoy
the car."  The dealer even went so far as to tear apart the LSD and
rebuild it (an effort many mechanics later called ridiculous).  But I
couldn't let it go.  It was irritating and I knew it would be in the way
when it came to selling the car.

I finally ran into a newly-hired shop foreman at a local dealer who was
terribly cocky and swore he could fix it.  After a frustrating three day
effort he finally replaced the control arms (aka trailing arms) in the
rear with a used set from an 85 Carrera in the lot, and bingo, no more
noise!  The original control arms showed no signs of unusual wear and
he speculated that just pulling them off and putting them back on
might have corrected it.  The 85 got my control arms and did not have
the problem.  I have new respect for cocky mechanics.

Your problem?  Dunno.  But it's worth a shot if cheaper experimenting
can't fix it.

Nathan:

I said:

Without question the biggest bang for your buck is the Autothority Stage

kit promises 300+ HP for the 951.

You say:

I am not one to believe everything that after market suppliers claim about
their products.  Caveat emptor applies here as well as to buying Porsches.
Usually chip sets are offered for a trial period with the option of
returning same if not satisfied.  Chips are very easy to replace if you
have never done so. Authority's claim of 270 HP for Stage II chips seemed a
bit generous.  I think 250 HP would be closer to the truth for my car but I
have no dyno check to verify this.

In any case I still have my original head gasket with well over 100k miles
and half of that with Stage II chips.  I don't know of any statistics on
the incidence of gasket failure with one kind of chip set versus another,
and I doubt that Authority or anyone else would willingly provide this
information.   Nor do I know how many sets Autothority has sold versus
other suppliers.  Those who advertise broadly probably sell more and
therefore are more likely to have discovered soft head gaskets.  If you
have any hard information on this subject it would be of great value to 951
owners who are contemplating different chip sources.

As for mass flo sensors, you say:

>Their mass flow sensor claims are complete bunk.

Time will tell.  The Carrera and the 951 are quite different animals. One
has only to contemplate the convoluted air induction path on the 951 to
suspect that there might be a better way.  Obviously Porsche has considered
this with the 968 and (I imagine) the 968 Turbo which have hot-wire mass
flo sensors and improved breathing.  Possibly  Autothority's claims for the
Carrera mass flo kit are greatly exaggerated.  I have met at least one
competitor who was thoroughly pleased.  Maybe his car was poorly tuned
before he made the change?  I don't think the Autothority 951 mass flow
question is going to be resolved until a few people try them.  My intention
is to compare it to Stage II.  The test will be largely subjective unless I
can borrow an accelerometer (g-meter).  Stay tuned.

I said:

I lean to empiricism.  One designs on engineering calculations and develops
on actual measurements.  I don't doubt for a moment that triangulaion of
the strut towers with a braces against the fire wall would be a better
method, but that is hardly the simple bolt-on mod that prompted Kevin's
inquiry.  That you must able to quantify the improvements offered by after
market equipment is hardly practical for most of us.  Perhaps you would
divulge your irreproachable sources of data so we may all proceed to
enlightenment through means other than the seat of our pants, the stopwatch
and the trophy.

You say:

don't waste your money, spend it on tires and seat time instead.

I couldn't agree more.  However, tires and track time only go so far before
the itch for change begins to dawn, which helps sell new Porsches to those
who can afford them and Porsche mods to those who can't.

Kevin:

Many thanks for your comments about my oxygen sensor.  The surging that I
mentioned might be better described as lumpy or irregular acceleration at
fixed  aggressive but not full throttle.

As for deceleration, yes, there is a tendency for the engine not to want to
slow down at off-throttle.  Throttle switch and switch setting check out
OK.  I unplugged the oxy sensor yesterday as you suggested.  Idle perked
100 RPM but can't say what else has changed until the roads dry off a bit.

As for fuel, I stick to Chevron 93 octane.  I ran a jug of Techron through
awhile back thinking this might be an injector thing.  No change.  Possibly
I am experiencing inflections in the torque curve which my geriatric bod
was too insensitive to notice before.  Still can't escape feeling that the
hidden hand of the DME is responding to secret messages, and I want to know
what they are.

Subject: Resolution: 914 fuel problems


I wanted to pass on to porschephiles the resolution of all my fuel
problems.  First off, I replaced the tank.  I will probably get that
repaired by a shop experienced with that kind of thing.  The other
discovery I made is that a 914 WILL run if you hook up the fuel pump
backwards.  However, it will not run well, and it will make one
wonder why you bought this slug of a car anyway.  My wife actually
came outside to tell me that the 914 sounded SO much better once
I had redone all the fuel hoses :-).  It also idles ALOT better now.

In any case here is what I have learned:

The gas tank has two fittings on the bottom of the fuel tank.  One is
3/8" and the other is 5/16".  The larger line is the fuel feed line.
It has a fuel strainer on the inside of the tank to filter out large
pieces of junk.  The smaller line is the fuel return line, with no
strainer on the inside (because it should be returning clean gas).

The pre '75 fuel pumps have three connections - all 3/8".  They are
labeled S (Supply), D (Druk/Pressure), and R (Return).  The 
Druk/Pressure connection is mislabeled in the Hayes manual as Damper -
which doesn't make alot of sense.  

The Supply line goes to the fuel filter and then on to the fuel 
feed line (3/8").

The Druk/Pressure line goes to the fuel rail supplying fuel to 
the injectors, the cold start valve, and the pressure regulator.

The Return line goes to a T, where is meets up with the return line
from the Pressure Regulator, and the Fuel Tank Return line (5/16").

On my car, all of the feed lines were 3/8" high pressure fuel hose,
and the return lines were all 5/16".  As that made alot of sense I
used that same procedure.

I have not yet addressed the fact that my pump runs whenever the 
ignition is on.  That and the relocation of the fuel pump to
front of the car are future projects :-) [never a shortage of those].

I would also like to thank all the people who responded to my requests 
for help.  Hopefully this article will help other people who have
914 fuel problems.

This may or may not apply to 911s.  I have a similar reset button

I've had bad CVs before in my VW Bus. That was more of a repeating

This was actually my 1st guess.  I dont know enough about bushings

I really suspect shocks or bushings since I sometimes hear
the sound while getting out of the car, relieving my body

  There is now available from several sources an eraser like wheel that
mounts in a drill chuck.  I think it is made of urethane, and when used
properly will completely remove decals without the use of solvents
or scrapers, leaving paint undamaged.  More probably, needing a waxing
to restore to original.  At worst, no more than kerosene, eh?

  I have seen these in the Eastwood catalogs, and maybe jc whitney  $15?

Subject: 911 carb diagnostics

Listen!  The unmistakeable cry of an amateur in over his head.  71 911T engine
with Zeniths.  Running, and pulling quite nicely, but lumpy idle and not
feeling smooth until revs get above 2500-3000.  I ordered the absurdly expen-
sive little crack vial to measure accelerator pump output, and the float level
gauge.  Accelerator pump vial doesn't fit in carb throat.  Do I guess cor-
rectly that I'm supposed to use it when the carb is half apart and the venturi
tubes are out?

Float level problem:  Float level gauge just fills and overflows, whether engine
is running (panicturnofftheignition) or not.  Buy a fuel pressure regulator,
set it for 1.5 lbs, then 1 lb., gauge still overflows whenever fuel pump runs.
My hypothesis then is that either my floats don't float, or my float valves are

if the float valves were that far gone?

The major change from the 928S to the 928S4 was the body style as described
above. In 1985 and 1986 the U.S. 928S also had the 5.0 liter 4 valve per
cylinder engine, although it had the AFC fuel injection rather than the DME
injection of the '87 and on S4, and 290 hp instead of 320 hp. The 1986 928S
also had ABS brakes and the late production 1986s also had 4-piston "S4"
brake calipers. 1986 was also the model year that Porsche changed to the
Borg-Warner synchros. As I remember, the 1987 928S4 also introduced movable
louvers to regulate air flow in the front of the car, the clutch on the
manual car was changed to a single plate setup from double plate, double
electric engine fans replaced the engine driven fan, and the wheels and
tires were wider in the rear (8x16 with 245/45s) than in the front. There
were probably other changes that I don't know or remember off the top of my
head since the most significant changes to the 928 were with the
introduction of the S4 for the 1987 model year.

This is rather common, most noticeable with cold engine/transmission. When 
you depress the clutch, the engine RPM raises because you disengage the 
gearbox which does require some force to rotate.
 When the engine is hot, it shouldn't be annoyingingly much of difference on 
idle with or without depressed clutch.

Hi,

I have decided to go to the 'Porsche Parade Europe' in Sweden the 16-19 
June. On the way I'm going to check a '64 SC that's been up for Sale for 
quite some time. It's a light blue metallic coupe, with leather interior. 
And of course it is a restoration object. It is all complete but is rather 
rusty. 
What kind of SC coupe could you get in the US for this money??? Rustbuckets? 
I think the price seem pretty fair, but until I've seen the car it's 
difficult to judge. 
Compared to my A coupe there are some clear pro's ; this car has never been 
restored, it has matching numbers, it is complete.....

I haven't driven a mile yet in my A coupe, but it is pretty obvious I need a 
'go-faster' car.....just like the SC's. My '60 T-5 coupe isn't really the 
car for it either. I really could enjoy the T-6 cars larger windows, the C 
model disc brakes, leather interior, the 95HP engine and the cheaper body 
parts :)

Any opinions out there............?

cheers,
trond

I like both cars, but am in the minority in liking the Q45 better than the
Lexus LS 400. The LS 400 is more Mercedes-like, softer; the Q45 is more
big-BMW-like, with considerably better performance and more
performance-oriented engineering features. The chains instead of belts are
just one more example of that.
 
>Has anyone tried the temporary "link" belts...
 
Sounds like a good way to get more, or even more, engine damage. If the belt
breaks, it's probably time to have the car towed and let pros do it, or wait
until Monday morning when the parts counter opens to sell you the right belt.
(Does that temporary belt really replace the toothed timing belts, or is it
just to replace broken V-belts?)

Hi, Mark & Hubert.

>Of course, the S4 can also be identified by the prominent model designation

The big difference (to me at least) was that the model designation S4 was
designed by a friend of mine, Elizabeth Henry. We just had dinner last
night, after installing her Mac system. There's a great story to go with
that S4 logo. It was one of her first jobs in the Porsche styling
department. They asked her to design a new logo, consistent with standard
Porsche typefaces, to go with the new car. "Is tomorrow afternoon OK?" she
asked. "Oh, no, Elizabeth, we want a first class job. Take two weeks." So
she had to pretend to be busy for two weeks, and came up with a
straight-line 928 S4 logo. They put this on the mockup, and showed it to the
company leaders. Peter Schutz came along, took one look at it, and said
something like "Oh, no, Elizabeth, you've got it all wrong. It should look
like
      9 2 8   S
                4
 
moved the 4 down, and walked off. Proving that when you're at that level of
management, you can do in thirty seconds what mere mortals can't
accomplish in two weeks. <g>
 
The 928 S4, or S  if you want, came out as a 1987 model, with 316 hp.
                4
It had a 5-liter engine; that's now up to 5.4 liters in the current GTS
models, with 345 hp. They're pretty neat cars, just woefully misunderstood
in the marketplace, and when they get on in years and miles they can be
expen$ive to keep running. Still, used 928s are a steal, and I often toy
with the idea of getting one. As long as nothing electronic starts smoking,
I figure I can keep it on the road.

  Subject:  Carb diagnostics

  Bill,
  I'm doing my webers on my 914.  And had some difficulties.
  Maybe another kind soul will respond with precise how-to's...but for now
i offer my thoughts.

  Float level is pretty important to idle and off-idle part throttle
progression.  I think its because the idle ports supplying fuel are
fed by the level of fuel in the bowl, and if that level is way off
the mixture is also off and could cause poor running.  I'm not sure
about Zenith's, but weber's have more than one port to provide a smooth
'transition' from idle to run when the butterfly's open.
  Accelerator pump settings have no effect at idle, but as you throttle
from idle (or part-closed) the pump shot can have some mask over
transition.  
  The accel pump shot is an afteradjustment, I set
mine to give best effect at already open throttle settings.  Many times
the pump shot runs out long after off-idle throttleup has occured, weber
has a wonderfully long travel adjustment for this.
  Since you said the engine runs good above 2500 rpm, it shows the high
speed jets are working.  That's not saying much.  They almost always work.

 -back to float level's.
  Adjusting the float level is not a big thing.  There should be a spec for
the measurement, usually bending a tab over the grose jet makes the adjust
of fuel level.  It is very important that the float actually floats in 
fuel..sometimes they dont and then you've lost control.  Another nasty
thing these can do is bind..ever whacked a carb on the side to make it
stop flooding?  Anyway, check the level with an accurate scale, make it right.
  Another minor, but pesky detail that must be right is the carburetor
gasketing..they must be in good shape to prevent leaks of fuel or vacuum.
 -very important at idle/low rpm.

Subject: 911 Starting Problems

Hi all!

I'm seekeing the net wisdom on the following problem. My '84 Carrera with 28K
miles has suddenly developed starting problems when cold (either overnight
parking or after a few hours of not running).

It all started about 2 weeks after filling up with Texaco's new System 3 gas.
I figured I try it since they advertised a "cleaner running engine in 60 days"
or something like that.

I've had the car for over a year and haved used either Hess or Amoco gas since
I bought it. The car has always started correctly when cold even in the real
cold winter we had here in the Northeast.

The correct start sequence was: just turn the key, engine will rev up to about
1200-1400 RPM, and after about ~30sec it will slowly decrease to about 1000 RPM
and then go down to about 800 RPM, its dling speed. This happened consistently
ever since I had the car.


Now the problem: All of the sudden, after starting from cold, the car now idles
to 800 RPM then down to 600, a sput, up to 1100-1000. There is some minor 
shaking, not violent, then down to ~700, wanting to stall, down to 600, then 
level off. It feel as if one cylinder was missing. Either gas or electrical 
(spark).

Questions:

1. Did I get a bad batch of gas? The engine seems to run fine after it warms up.
   Plenty of pep and power. Feel no difference as before.

2. Could this be related to to the temp sensor going bad? I understand there is
an upgrade that applies to 84-88 Carreras (as posted in Excellence and the net)
This upgrade relates to misterious running, cutting out, bucking, smoke...
Except for misterious running, I don't know if it applies to my situation.

Then again, the temp sender is critical in sending data to the DME brain that
controls timing and injection while starting.

Is it possible that it has failed, and because of the warmer temps (50~70) that
we are experiencing, it is sending incorrect values to DME cpu? Perhaps it works
correctly at low temps but not at mild temps?

3. Where is the sensor? I understand it is located in #3 cyl. Easy to get to?
   Can I just put a voltmeter at the harness end and measure its resistance?
   What would its value be?

4. Has any one else experienced similar problems with other DME controlled cars?
   Solutions?

I'm kind of baffled. Don't know if it is gas or something else. It kind of bugs
me since I never had the problem before I filled up. Was it a coincidence?!!
Bummer....


As usual, thank you in advance for you response.

My wife and I attended our first driving school at Pocono this past

including a three day event at Watkins Glen.  My wife also does autox.

Sharing the car between two people was pretty hard on the stock brakes.
The pads were at 50% for tech.  The brake pad warning light came on
Sunday night just as we were leaving.  What would be a good replacement
pad for our intended use?  We've heard some good things about Cool-Carbons,
would that be a good choice?  Should I replace just the front (there's
still some life left in the rear) or do all four?  The braking seemed
smooth, do I need to get the rotors turned with the new pads?  Should
I replace the rotors?  Any other questions I should be asking?  :-)

The car is a stock 87 944S with 16" wheels and Yoko AVS-I tires.

Anatomy of an email barrage:

1) User 1 sends out a mail message to a large email list, requesting help.
2) Mail message gets stuck in an outgoing queue somewhere in the swamp
   (superhighway my ass, it's a swamp).  In failsafe mode for no
   discernable reason, the machine makes sure the message gets sent by
   sending out X copies to the list. Msgcount: X
3) Users 2 - 2+N decide, after getting two copies of the same message,
   that perhaps something is wrong with their local mailer, and so send
   out a request to the whole list wondering if anyone else is
   experiencing problems. msgcount: X+N
4) Users 2+N+1 - 2+N+Y decide, after getting 5 copies of the same
   message, that user 1 is a bonehead.  These users also figure the rest
   of the members of the mailing list haven't yet realized that User 1 is
   a bonehead, so they all decide to send mail to the whole list to let
   them know. msgcount: X+N+Y
5) Users 2+N+Y+1 - 2+N+Y+Z decide, after getting 15 copies of the same
   message, but not yet receiving messages from steps 3 & 4, feel sorry
   for bonehead user 1, and send mail to the whole list politely explaining
   how to use mail, so that any other users who are as boneheaded as
   user 1 will also benefit from their wisdom. msgcount: X+N+Y+Z
6) User 1 begins to get many copies of his own message, plus the
   irritated responses from list users whose mailbox rights have been
   violated.  Immediately apologetic, user 1 sends mail to the whole
   list explaining it wasn't his fault. msgcount: X+Y+Z+N+1
7) Users 2 - 2+N+Y feel bad for implying that user 1 is a bonehead,
   and send mail to the whole list, with the noble intention of
   apologizing publicly for the public insult.  msgcount: X+2N+2Y+Z+1
8) Obnoxious user C decides that users 2 - 2+N+Y+Z are all boneheads,
   and posts a message to the whole group implying such.  
   msgcount: X+2N+2Y+Z+2 
9) Everyone gets pissed off at user C, sending mail to the whole list
   saying user C's msg was inappropriate.  msgcount: Only Sagan can
   count that high.  If each message where a grain of sand on the beach,
   the beach would cover the surface of 10 planet earths.
10)user C writes a filter to insure that all mail from the list gets
   diverted to /dev/null for the duration of the barrage.
11)Everyone wonders how the barrage got started and tries to remember
   what the *real* purpose of the list is.

Ooops.  I think I may have posted out of turn.

Design feature. It's *SUPPOSED* to run with the ignition on. For the
race car, we added an extra relay and switch so that main power
being on didn't run the pump. On the other hand, once you click the
pump switch, I have it interlock so you can't turn it off without
either getting the car upside down or turning off main power. After
losing pump power after getting bumped once, that was enough for me...

Also, if you listen *REAL* close, if the ignition is on, and you 
crank open the throttle, you can hear the injectors fire. Preferably 
done with your head under the hood, natch...

Not only did I solve my poor-running problem the other day, but I earlier
discovered the solution to the problem I had with my 911 cutting off when
warm and under load between 3000 and 4000 rpm. Yes, it WAS the CD box, though
all the shops I talked to told me it probably was not the CD, since they
normally cut out entirely.  Of course several people here guessed at this as
being the problem. Another case of the power of the Net!
Another benefit of this situation has been, at long last, the discovery of an
honest and competent shop here in Charlotte. Terry Sossoman at the 911 Shop
is a refreshing change from some of the other places I've dealt with.
Another place I've heard of, and had recommended, is Stuttgart Haus of Parts,
owned by Bill ????, who I've met at a few events and has always been
extremely nice and helpful with 'track' problems. Unfortunately his shop is
in Mooresville, quite a distance to push a dead Porsche.

Subject: 914 clutch problem... what is wrong


The latest (of a long list of) problem my 1.8L '74 914 has exhibited is
a problem getting into gear.  First I thought it was just the
1st synchro going, but then it became hard to get into 2nd, 3rd... The
car also rolled forward when starting with the tranny in first even
though the clutch was fully depressed.

Two nights ago I adjusted the clutch cable much tighter, and that seemed
to solve the problem, for a while.  This afternoon, 80 miles later,
the same symptoms are appearing again.  

I have eyeballed the entire system.  Both the mechanism on the tranny, and
the clutch pedal cable connection seem to be fine.  I had though that it was
the clutch cable ripping through the fire-wall.  But, I watched the cable as
my wife depressed the clutch pedal and the cable didn't seem to be pulling
through the firewall.  There were also no rips in the firewall, or 
anything else indicated that looked suspicious.

What do you think is wrong?  How can I _tell_ that the cable is
pulling through?

Any and all advice appreciated.  The 914 is my only form of transport
right now (could be lots worse :-)), and I really need to keep it
on the road.

Subject: Re: 944S Brake Pads

Jim,

I am a fan of the Cool Carbon brakes. Especially nice is that I find them
just fine for street use, as long as you don't mind a little squeal when
they're cold, which on the street is most of the time.

Tracks like Watkins Glen (my favorite) can allow fairly high speeds on the
long straights, which means turning lots of kinetic energy into heat before
the next corner. The Cool Carbon brakes (and other similar products) have a
ceramic layer to insulate the caliper from the heat in the pad and rotor.
Cooler calipers mean less chance of boiling brake fluid and therefore fade.
They work! I have also added the Cool-Brake duct kits which get more cooling
air into the rotors. This is also good.

Turning the rotors is good if they have significant grooving or very slight
warping. Heavy warping is grounds for replacement. Be sure to allow a good
cool-down at the track to avoid warpage, which I have had some troubles with,
especially when I was using stock pads.

If you do use more agressive pads, be sure to carefully follow the bedding in
and (in the case of Cool Carbons) the break-in / heat cycling procedure. They
simply MUST be properly conditioned or you WILL lose the ability to stop your
car. I saw a heartbreaker of an accident at the Glen when a 951 driver (who
really knew better) lost his brakes at the end of the front straight and
became intimately acquainted with the tire barriers. Lots of front end
damage. He walked away, fortunately. The cause: he was using brand-new carbon
pads, not yet broken in. Be forewarned.

I have also had good experience with Repco MetalMasters, which are a fine
street pad and suitable for some track driving, although they are no match
for the Cool-Carbons.

Note that in autocrossing you never get the pads warm enough to need cooling
ducts, I suspect. Also, you may not get the carbon pads up to temp, but I am
not as familiar with the rigors of autox. Maybe some other 'netters can chime
in.

OBTW, I would not put mismatched pads in the front vs. rear axle. You could
get lockup at one end before the other, leading, as they say, to some loss of
control.

   Somebody mentioned seeing a 911SC RS or some such beast.  I'm
wondering if that's the same type car/beast I saw at a local club
autocross last summer.  I went with a friend out to the lake that's
here in the Sacramento area where a Porsche club was having an
autocross.  A guy there brought what other's referred to as the "RS"
and was cruising it around the track.  He had some trouble with the
brake calipers the first trip out and didn't finish, but later in the
day had it running great.  It was painted up in its "race" scheme
which was primarily lime green.  It doesn't sound that nice but I have
to admit it was a sharp looking car.  I think the sound is what I'll
remember most though!  Someone there said that it was raced at Lemans
and is worth $4-500k.  Could this be true?

   Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that while "cruising" around the track
he turned top time of the day.

Darren,
	I have heard a similar noise coming from my '85 944.  It occurs 
occasionally when the rear of the car starts to "kneel down" under 
acceleration.  It was hard to reproduce otherwise.  I believe it to be one of 
the shocks.  It often re-occurs after the car has been jacked up but seems to 
go away after a little while.  Sound familiar??

BTW, can anyone tell me why my timing belt occassionally rattles against the 
timing belt cover (just under the cam gear cover) when the car is cold, but 
goes away after warming up for 4 or 5 minutes.  Additionally, when I drive it 
in to have it looked at warm, the belt appears to be tight.  Is this more 
likely to be:

a.) a bad cam gear that is "throwing" the belt
b.) an improperly tensioned belt (my car doesn't have the spring tensioner)
c.) common for a > 130K mile car with shot motor mounts
d.) just another expensive repair in the works

Subject: To FI or not to FI

My dad is trying to decide whether to revert his '74 914 2L to stock
fuel injection or not. His car currently has a single Holly and is,
shall we say, rather anemic. My car (also a '74 2L) has what appears to
be stock fuel injection and it feels like it has more power (it's
subjective, since the cars are about 800 miles apart and I can't jump
out of one and into the other...). The problem is that my car is a
`mystery car'. The owner prior to the one I bought it from had intended
to autocross it, and it has an outstanding suspension - there's a chance
that he also played tricks w/ the engine, but I'll never know unless I
crack the case. The feeling of better power may be just a subjective
feeling due to the fact that my springs, shocks and brakes are so much
stiffer/better, or maybe I have shorter gearing?...

Anyway, if you ask George Hussey at Automobile Atlanta, he'll tell you
to revert to FI. It seems to be the conventional wisdom for street
914's.  I test drove a lot of 2L's before I bought mine (most of them
carburetted) and all felt anemic, so I'm inclined to advocate FI.

My dad still has much of the original FI (throttle body, computer,
etc.), so he'll probably not have to spend too much for parts (he
figures a few hundred $$, max). This is not a `money is no object'
project :-). Another option would be to change to duel webers and a cam,
or a different single carb, I suppose. 

Does anyone care to comment on how he can best evaluate his options?

You're mostly correct about the distinction between the 928S and S4, but you
missed one important fact: the '85 and '86 928S cars also have the 4-valve
engine, and in the case of the later 86 cars (after serial number 1000) also
have the improved (larger) brakes of the S4.  The induction system of the 85 and
86 cars is different from that of the S4, and the engines are rated at about 25
less horsepower, but the road tests of the time do not show a significant
performance difference.

There is also a variety of other more minor differences.

It is very difficult to distinguish an '85 or '86 928S from an earlier one,
other than by opening the hood or checking the VIN number.

The first model year for the S4 was 1987.

Gee, it's been a long time since a Zenith carb question.  

I put 80K mi on a 70T with Zeniths and picked up some experience.

Float level problem:

The float level gauge should not overflow.  If memory serves, there are
two sets of marks on the float gauge and the lower ones are for the Zeniths,
the upper for the Webers.

You have at least one leaky needle, or a stuck float.  If the car has not
been run in a while the float can be stuck by varnish residue to the 
bottom of the chamber.  In that case you'll need to disassemble the carb.

The float level should be tested with the car running, but the needles
should not leak with the engine off and the fuel pump running.

In my experience, the car will run, but not well, with two carb float
chambers overflowing.

You can replace the float needles without taking apart the carbs, but you
will need to remove the carb air horns + air cleaner sheet metal.  This
is a 6 nut + 4 screw job per carb side.  The float height is adjusted
by varying the number of sealing washers under the needle.

If fixing the overflowing problem doesn't help, you can check the 
following to see if they are not clogged.

      1. Idle jets
      2. Idle mixture screw ports
      3. transition ports

On the Zeniths, you might have clogged transition ports, you'll see a
large brass screw head covering the ports on each carb throat, take
off the screw and see if the holes are clean.  Shine a light down the
throat while cracking the throttle plate to reflect light through the
ports.  You'll see a small array of holes, if you clean them out 
be careful not to enlarge them.  The port sizes are given in the spec book
as 0.7/0.7/1.1/1.1mm.

Clogged transition ports can cause backfiring on deceleration and
could effect off idle performance.

Check the mixture screws by taking them out and seeing if you can
see through their ports as you did the transition ports.

Pull out the idle jets and see if any are clogged.

Also check the smog decel stuff.  It is an additional source of mixture
that is only supposed to be active when at >1200rpm with the throttles closed.
The diaphram frequently fails.  European models did not have this feature,
so the carbs work fine with this part disconnected and the enrichment intake 
ports plugged.  They could be introducing a vacuum leak.

Accelerator pump vial:

For measuring the accelerator pumps, you can get a 1 ml plastic hypodermic
syringe body and use a soldering iron to melt and close the needle end, 
you can drill a hole in the syringe body tab and attach a wire to use as 
a handle. Use a knife to mark the syringe calibration marks since gasoline 
can dissolve the printed marks.  You will not need to disassemble the carb 
any to make the measurement, just pull the air cleaner off and snake the 
syringe down under the nozzle.  PMO (Porsche Mail order) may have been
the originator of this idea, they supplied mine.

On the Zeniths, the accelerator pump linkage may stick, make sure the
rolling wheel and accelerator pump shaft sleeve bearings are lubricated.

If your needles are worn you'll probably want to get a carb rebuild kit
since 4 X needle price might make it reasonable.  A carb rebuild kit
won't help with throttle shaft wear or throttle plate wear, 
but cleaning out a carb and making it look new is a rare experience now.

The Zenith carbs are actually simple one barrel carbs, but they do have six of
everything, even six accelerator pumps.  IMHO new Zeniths are not inferior 
to new Webers.  However, Zeniths are impossible/difficult/expensive to get 
new parts for and were never supported with a wide variety of jets/venturiis.

Subject: 914 QOTW (Question Of The Week)



Ok, I'm fairly stumped with this one.  I've got a 914 with stock
1.7l fuel injection that has a little problem with cutting out under
hard throttle conditions.  

When the car is cool, everything works pretty well.  Once things have
warmed up a bit, under heavy load, the engine acts like it's cutting
out.  I've been through most of the systems and here's what I think:

I think the fuel injection trigger points are going/have gone.  Here's
why: I've checked for air leaks and taken care of anything
questionable, I've check the ignition (not at full load, but...) and
all looks good, it's not the aux. air valve because I've plugged the
hose from that - which is the key.  I believe that when the engine is
cool, the trigger points can miss a time or two and all is fine
because there is more than enough extra fuel from the cold start
system - and no extra air from the aux. air valve.  When things warm
up and the extra fuel isn't added, the miss on the trigger points
shows up, especially under load around the track, because there is no
extra fuel supplementing what is being delivered.  

So, any thoughts?  I really need the help now - the new motor isn't
going to be ready for the next time trial and my codriver and I really
want to run.

Hi,

While were at it, can someone post the engine_size/horsepower/year for the 
928 series. I know the first cars are carburettor models and 250 HP or 
something like that, but the S series started in '80 (Europe) I believe, is 
that when the 928 got the 'new' injected 300 HP engine too? And then came 
the S4 about '86 or perhaps earlier?! 
Someone once tried to sell me an S4 engine for NOK 25000 which is about 
$3200, loked at it and found the engine to be in need of a top-end rebuilld, 
this all happened about two years ago, I was negotiating about a '82 928S 
with blown engine at the time and where really tempted.
Had the S4 engine been allright I would have bought the car for it. 
What could a full overhaul of one head for this engine cost ???

Subject: 914 problem

Porschephiles:  I have a problem with my 1973 914 2.0 L. When I start it
up, and either creep along or accelerate slowly, the engine speed
oscillates, so that it lunges forward and then slows down with a period of
about 1 second. The engine doesn't cut out completely, just slows down.
This lunging stops after the engine warms up. My first thought is to ignore
it, since I can avoid it by keeping engine rpm up. My second thought is
that the throttle position sensor (?) has a dirty place at semi-closed
position. Maybe the mixture at startup is far too rich? What do people
think? Where should I look first? Thanks, Michael

You may want to check the cylinder head temperature sensor. Some years
ago, my 2.0 914 had a somewhat similar problem, where, after a period
of relatively hard acceleration, the motor would essentially stop
running for a few seconds, then run again, then cut out again. I chased
this for quite a while before I traced it to the cylinder head sensor.
The sensor is a thermistor, and it would apparently go open at high
temperatures, which makes the FI go to full rich (part of the diagnosis
was that other Porsche owners behind me (on the way to track events
together) would say they smelled gas, as well as seeing a mist at the
tailpipe). When the cylinder head cooled (from not running), the
thermistor would reconnect, and the engine would run again.

To diagnose, wait until the car is warmed up, and then short the
wire to the temperature sensor to ground (when hot, the thermistor
resistance to ground is relatively low). If the symptoms go away,
you have found the problem.

Some of my more specific questions Are:

I will be purchasing jackstands, What is a good height (max)? Any safety 
suggestions?

For aligning the clutch, will the $ 5.00 tool that is in Automotion & Tweeks 
work?
********does this tool replace the short drive shaft?*********

Can a Hydraulic floor jack be substituted for the transmission jack,  and if 
so any suggestions?

What specific tools are required or optional? (to make this difficult

Intake-air Manifold shortcuts and hints?

Single part Exhaust system (cross pipe) ideas? I have heard removal is a real

I don't understand the part about using the 8mm bolt to remove the 
releaser-lever shaft?

What parts or hardware do you recommend replacing besides the clutch plate 
,pressure plate
release bearing, pilot bearing and the two clutch pilot arm bearings?

Are the EuroSelect Parts Ok?  SACHS STUFF I HAVE HEARD  W/ 1 year Warranty.

I will probably have more questions later but enough for now, hope I didn't 
put you on overload.

No, it actually stabilizes for a while at ech of the idle speeds. 

I actually measured the resistance at the wiring connector for the temp head
sensor (NTC 2). I measured 1.3K. Probst? (sp) book on Bosch fuel injection says
that at room temp (68 F) the sensor should read ~3K. This might explain my 
problem since Motronic CPU thinks car is already warm. 1.3K extrapolates to
a head temp of about 140 F when in actuallity is cold!

Cold engine = high resistance = (more fuel + adjustment of timing) by CPU

In my case, it would be like starting a cold car without the choke...

After running for about 2 mins. I read ~.9K. This seems to be ok, since 
his book says that at normal operating temp (~190 F) the value should be ~ .4K
So the decrease in temp in my sensor matches the general downward trend.

Can someone on the net confirm that at room temp the value should be ~3K. If 
that is the case, I do have a bad sensor. It might be working fine at lower
temps, like below 40 F, but failing at current ambient temps here in Jersey 
( 70F)

Once the car has warmed up I have no problem starting. 


Thanks for any feedback, and I hope that my troubleshooting experience can help
someone else...

I think that this qualifies me for the above-mentioned title.  (You,

the courage to actually *drop* my engine out, or possibly even 
*rebuild* it (gasp!), I'll qualify for "God of All 914s!"  ;-)

calls to "experts" with problems I couldn't face on my own!  Oh,
well, maybe I can get it down to 90 minutes in another five or six
tries.  An interesting way to spend an afternoon, and to save myself
ninety bucks.
    Actually, it wasn't as bad as I make it sound.  It *is* a rather
lengthy procedure for the first-timer, though.  And I only have two
small scrapes on my right hand, and only *one* feeler-gauge slice on
my left hand!
    If anyone wants a long note on how I did it, I'll e-mail direct

    BTW, I couldn't find a tolerance for the valve clearances in the

Have you inspected all the motor and trany mounts?  I've seen this 
sort of thing in a friend's car (at the track) and when we went under
to adjust the cable again (thinking that it might be time to replace
the cable) I spotted several loose bolts on the trany mounts.  We checked

of the problems.

Just a thought.

Subject: 944 Right-Rear "Whirring"


Over the last couple of weeks the right-rear-wheel of my 1983 944 (87k miles)
has developed a "whirring" sound.  The sound has been getting louder as time
progresses.  The sound is most evident at highway speeds but it is also present
at slower speeds.  If I place a lateral load on the right-rear-wheel, by 
turning the car to the left, the sound disappears until the car returns
to straight line travel at which time the whirring returns.  If I turn to
the right the sound does not disappear.  In addition, if the suspension
gets compressed (going over a bump) the whirring also disappears briefly.

This is not the "click-click-click" sound that I have heard when I have
had CV joints fail on other cars.  It could be a bad wheel bearing, but
the sound is "smoother" that bad wheel bearing sounds that I have heard
before.  As a last bit of info, the tires were replaced at 75k miles.

Any comments or ideas from the collective wisdom on the net ?

They are pretty easy to replace, but I have heard too many cases of
intelligent people toasting their DME's when replacing them.  Unfortunately,
Autothority doesn't tell you to disconnect the battery or wear an ESD
cuff, which seem like common sense to an engineer geek like myself but
has not to a lot of their customers.

I really don't understand why you would claim 250 vs 270 hp without
using a dyno.  Where do you get these or any numbers?

>In any case I still have my original head gasket with well over 100k miles
>and half of that with Stage II chips.

The problems seem to arise with track use, ie, extended time with your
foot on the floor, and not with street driving.  The OE head gasket is
not "soft" to my knowledge.  It's just a much cheaper "weak link" or
safety valve than putting a hole in a piston.

>>Their mass flow sensor claims are complete bunk.

>Time will tell.  The Carrera and the 951 are quite different animals.

Wrong.  Dynos tell, and they tell right away.  The mass flow sensor is
a scam and a fraud, as is the hogged out throttle body the sell.  Both
Nathan and I use dynos (he engine, me chassis).

As I said a month or so ago, there are lots of reasons other than power
for Bosch and Porsche to use a hot-wire (or the newer surface-type)
air sensor.  Like reliability, lifetime, and cost to manufacture.  You
might just as well claim that the new body-colour wheels on Porsches are
performance enhancements.

>I lean to empiricism.

Yeah, great, and I'm still stuck somewhere between Cartesian mind-body
duality and Heideggerian readiness-to-hand.  I guess we all have our
crosses to bear.  Nathan's a mechanical engineer, has done the field

Michael,

So from your description, you cannot move the transmission from gear to
gear, but the clutch engages and disengages properly.  I assume that
you moved the gearbox to 2nd with the engine off, depressed the clutch,
and made it to your mechanic in 2nd gear, using the clutch at stop
lights and such.

If this is the case, the problem lies with gear selection or in the
gearbox itself.  Could be the linkage, could be a selector fork has
been pushed out of position, could be a bad bushing in the gb.

Hmm.  So the pump should run even if the engine isn't running?  That
doesn't seem really necessary.  Why doesn't the pump kick on after
the ignition is first turned on (for a couple of seconds to bring
up the pressure) and then turn off until the engine actually starts

Porsche really design the system so that the pump runs w/o the
engine?

Hi Guys
Its me again. I hadc to give a friend a jump start today and noticed that
the 914 engine bay was full of smoke. The driver's side of the car (not the
side the battery is on) was the worest. You couldn't even see the motor. If
the engine was reved most of it went away, but it looked to me like the fan
was sucking the smoke down and out through the motor. Question is were is
the smoke coming from. Has a vaccum tube come loose from the cylender head
on that side of the motor or is something worse going on here. A little
backround on the car. It is 1 73 2.0 914 and has 135,5** miles on it. No
rebuilds ever. It burns about a quart of oil every 1,500 miles and only
smokes noticably during engine breaking. If you haven't been following I'm
the guy with the misterious miss fires in the FI. I'm still battling the
mechanic over that, he won't give me the money back, he wants to fix the
car and not charge me. So far he has put two new brains in the car and the
car is no better. The reason I bring this up here is to A) vent frustration
about this and B) Could the two things be related?
Thanx you for ready the note and any advice would be much apreciated

am enrolled, but the upholstry work on my car took FOREVER!  It now has a 
new dash installed.  Yes the windshield had to come out.  It was a disaster. 
I optioned for the "no speaker hole dash" and the hardware didn't line up 
with the holes in my dash., etc, etc, etc.  The seat came out great and
matches perfectly with the interior.  My upholstery guy happily accepts
my referrals, as long as nobody wants a new dash installed....

Anyway, the car now runs like crap.  I figure it's 4+ weeks of being started
and moved around the shop.  If I wanted a 4 cylinder Porsche I would have
bought a 912!  (car is a '70 911T).  Mel at Pacific Coast Porsche has

maybe a carb adjust will put things in order.  It's costing me a 6 pack
of Pepsi over costs and I have to (get to) help, but I was willing to spring

I have never attended any sort of driving or even safety school, and am
looking forward to getting some instruction and guidance.  I have no
plans at this time to start auto-xing or tracking the car, and don't
want to beat it up, but I do want to learn more about the cars and
my limits.  Note that I'm waiting to paint the car until after the

Anybody attending, look for a black 911T that could use some paint help

That's really, really, right -- and it's true for almost all Bosch FI

If you ask Stan Hanks, or anyone who's had to sit and listen to me about
FI, you get the same story... I will admit that it may be *CHEAPER* to
go to carbs, and there are some cases where you *MUST* go to carbs
(blasted SCCA Production rules...) But in general, you'll be happier

Figure on new injectors, seals, and lines. You are also advised to
consider new throttle contacts plate, FI points in the distributor,
and check that wiring harness VERY carefully before deciding it's OK.

It's simple: does he plan oncontinuing to drive the car more than 
another 3 years? If the answer is yes, he's going to have to do it at 
some point. Dat old debil EPA is going to pop up *EVERYWHERE* and
pretty much force the issue.

As to *HOW* to do it, I *HIGHLY* recommend starting with a running
car with stock FI. Swap your parts in one by one verifying that
you *STILL* have a running car (other than the previously mentioned new parts).
Makes the debugging *MUCH* easier.... I got to go through 7 whole sets
of 2.0 EFI stuff I bought at garage sales, via Pano, etc. to see what I had 
that worked and what didn't one weekend. You just can't do it by 
looking -- that swap in to see if it works is pretty much required...

|
| Points to ponder:
|
| Checking the tension while warm is invalid.  A reputable mechanic wouldn't do
| this.  Porsche specifies a $500 tool to check the tension, which is 
what Barrier
| used.  Some shops have not invested in this tool; they check the tension by

the street?
|
| The mechanic who tensioned my belts said that I had rotated the tensioner

|
| So, it sounds like you could have either incorrect tension, or the tensioner

| Also, if you have more than 30K miles on these belts, replace them ASAP.
| I understand that the current belts can go 45K miles between replacements,
| but the original belts were spec'd to be replaced every 30K miles.

But your message, Lou,  adds another point to ponder: It could be the 
water pump.
Leaking water would be a dead give away.  If none, then checking the belt(s)
would probably be easier/cheaper than replacing the pump.  You could also
try jiggling the pump pulley (after removing the belt cover, of course) 
to see if
there is noticable radial play (with the engine cold).

Subject: Re: Performance Upgrades (for 951s)

Charlie:

I'm sorry for the delay getting back to you, but we're really busy right  
now trying to get a car finished.  After rereading my post, it's pretty  
clear that I wasn't as diplomatic as I could have been.  I'm sorry if I  
was harsh, and I didn't mean to come off as a know-it-all.

That said, let me pass on information that I and others have collected  
regarding Autothority chips, based both on engine dynamometer data and  
experience on the race track.  Their chips for normally-aspirated engines  
do little (if anything) to increase horsepower, in direct contradiction to  
their claims.  Their chips for the 951 _do_ definitely make more power, if  
not quite as much as they claim.  Unfortunately, they seem to have little  
in-depth understanding of turbocharged engines, and their injection and  
ignition maps are grossly wrong in several places.  In particular, they  
run too much ignition advance at about 5400 rpm, near maximum boost, and  
detonation occurs.  Because the mapping is so wrong, the detonation occurs  
too rapidly for the KLR unit to compensate.  This leads to blown head  
gaskets.  I know personally of 15-20 people, and indirectly of many more,  
who have blown head gaskets with these chips, some of whom have lost their  
gaskets several times.  This has occured in engines with as little as  
5,000 miles on the Autothority chipset, and the problem is exacerbated at  
the track, where the engine gets hottest and runs at maximum boost the  
most.

I referred to Jon Milledge Engineering because his chip kits provide at  
least as much power, and none of his customers have lost a head gasket.   
His chips were developed properly on an engine dyno, and his knowledge of  
turbocharged engines is impressive.

Autothority's claims regarding the mass flow sensor have been repeatedly  
proven to be completely false.  I only referred to the one example of  
which I have personal knowledge.  There is no question that the air intake  
path on the 951 is convoluted.  Although turbocharging mitigates the  
problem somewhat, removing flow restriction is a big win, and there are  
several places where it is quite important.  However, the flapper box is  
not one of the them, and provides no significant restriction to flow,  
especially at full throttle.  


Porsche (and others) use the mass flow sensor primarily because it allows  
them to more accurately control emissions, particularly at small throttle  
settings and low rpm, and secondly because the sensor is more tolerant of  
pulses in the intake tract characteristic of cam profiles with more  
overlap.  This clearly became especially important in the 968 engine.  A  
proper turbo race engine uses only throttle position and manifold pressure  
to determine proper injector pulse width and ignition timing, but this is  
unrealistic for a street car.

If you are willing to spend $2000 on engine mods to your 951, you have  
many options, among them different camshafts or turbochargers.  They have  
the potential to make much more of a difference than removing the  
miniscule air restriction caused by the flapper box.

You said (in response to my comment that strut braces don't do anything):

I would never claim my sources are irreproachable; however, they are data,  
and based on measurement rather than "seat-of-the-pants" feel.  A strut  
brace on the 944 makes no significant difference by four different  
criteria:  actual on-track measurement of strut-to-strut deflection;  
actual on-track testing using comparative lap times (the "stopwatch");  
instrumented deflection measurement of scale models of the 944 chassis;  
and analysis of the torsional rigidity of the 944 chassis using CAE  
methods.

The latter two methods show that a strut brace does make a difference in  
conjunction with a properly-designed tube-frame structure which includes  
diagonal braces back _through_ the firewall to the tube structure.  Simple  
diagonal braces to the firewall won't help, since the firewall is quite  
flimsy.  We haven't documented the benefit of the strut brace under these  
conditions with on-track testing, and probably won't: I trust my  
engineering calculations, and we'll spend our limited testing time on  
tuning less-easily understand parameters.


There is no question there is a thriving Porsche aftermarket, and I'm  
sympathetic to those that wish to improve their cars, since I spend many  
hours every week doing just that.  It's too bad there aren't more sources  
of real data on the benefits of these modifications, but I wish people  
would be more skeptical of sales lies.  On the other hand, it's their  
money, and I'm not volunteering to debunk all the misinformation....

Take care,

Nathan

Try jacking up the rear of the car.  Go to each side and try wiggling the

hand at the top of the tire and the other at the botton and alternately 
push/pull.
I don't think you should get more than a couple of mm deflection if the
bearings are good.  If the right side gives noticably more deflection
than the left, suspect bearings.

Subject: Standing.......on wheels!

Hi,

The last three days I've been busy with my A coupe again, I just had to have 
a 'time-out' after the 'Ford_and_VW_engine_change_weekends'. I've put in the 
new front inner wings I had made by a panel beater, the fit was good but the 
job was lousy. I also spot welded some more on pan, diagonal-member, seam 
welded frame struts, and more seam welds. I jacked up the car after I had 
fitted the front suspension arms, and lowered it........ The car really sat 
nice on the wheels, it didn't flex a bit and it was quite a relief to see 
it. It still have to be put in the not_finished rotisseri and seam welded 
from the underside, but I do have some minor repairs to finish, and it'll be 
nice to roll the car back and forth in the garage :) :) :)
Before the last of May, I'm pretty sure the underbody welding work should be 
done, then it come to removing paint and bondo, repairing the left front 
fender and the right rear fender (the usual repair pieces should do). This 
should be another month of work, and just in time for the holiday the car 
could be ready for paint. I'm going for the 'buy compressor and do it 
yourself' option, but could very well decide to take out a favor a friend of 
mine owes me,......and have him paint the car. (he's a body preparer, but 
quite good at painting too.)
It's about time to start learning 'leading' too, I will not use bondo 
(unless I *HAVE* to) and the lead should be great to improve some places 
I've found to be attacked by the rust, but not rusted through.

The restoring is really up and down, but at least i seem to have a 
hobby........... :)

cheers,
trond

Problem with the 356 series cars are mostly corrosion. It really eat your 
car. It is important to find a car that has not been touched by 'real' 
amateurs. It's much worse correcting and replacing someones cheat or wrong 
done work, than starting with an 'untouched' car.

Almost all the 356 objects I've seen has had rust, you could find one 
without visible rust, but be sure the 'metal-worm' *is* there. (Correction ; 
I have seen one object without a trace of rust, I should have bought that 
'57 coupe :(
If you want to be able to restore a 356 my advice to you is; consider 
learning to weld, *or* learning metal work. The cutting, shaping, cleaning 
up, is the biggest part of the replacing job. The welding itself is easy if 
the panels are well shaped, fits, and the surfaces are clean.
You can do most of the work yourself, and have a friend or professional 
welder do the welding. But if you buy a wire-fed MAG welder, the job is 
really easy after some practice.

The C coupe should be a nice car to get to know the 356's through. I'm 
myself going to look at a '64 SC soon, it's quite rusty but complete.
The nice thing about the T-6 cars are there are lotsa 'cheap' body parts 
available. Where I have to pay some $ 2K for a nose clip for my '60 T-5, the 
T-6 clip is available from danish source for the net sum of $ 800. Fenders 
too are cheap compared to the A and T-5 models.

Not only the body part availability speaks for the later cars, disc brakes, 
better transmision, stronger engines, are some of the pros with the C cars. 
I believe you can get a nice object for your estimate, it could as well be a 
driver.

  Please correct me if I'm wrong (brain fade?), but my recollection is
that the pump spins up on first keyswitch (run) position to pressurize
the injector loop (1 or 2 secs), then shuts off until ignition occurs.
  -then the pump starts up again and runs until keyswitch is off, or
if ignition fails.  * this is a fire safety feature *  something even
american rolling objects employ on their FI cars.

Hello,

I want to paint my own wheel center caps.  I want to order the standard 
silver caps for my new C4 wheels.  The caps with the crest just stamped into 
the metal cap.  And I want to paint them myself.  Is this hard to do? 
What type of paint and brushes should I use?  What color is the yellow/gold 
background (Yellow or gold?)  Has anyone done this themselves?  Do you
think the standard new cap would need any preparation (primer, etc).

Why do I want to do this you may ask?  Well...
On page 24 of the Perfomance Products catalog No. 33, they advertise
that they are selling wheel center caps with an extra-large inlaid Porsche
crest embedded on the cap.  It is colored with the standard colors.  It
is the same size crest as on the caps for the C2/C4 wheels.  The only thing
about these caps is is that they are not available yet, and haven't been
for a while.  And they want $62.95 each, so I want to make my own.

In my 951, 944, VW (Bosch K), and Volvo (DME 4.3), the pump runs for 
about 2 seconds at ignition turn-on, during cranking, and when the 
engine is running (obviously!).  It does *not* run if the ignition is 
on and the engine is stopped, except for the afore-mentioned 2 seconds.

The 2 second blast is to establish pressure before cranking, as an aid 
in firing.

Note that this design is a safety feature, as the pump shuts off if the 
engine stalls, as might occur in an accident.

  Welcome to the fray Dave!
  Is a valve adjust really worth $90!
  Man, I'm rich!!  And having dropped the powertrain out of 'Saga' a total
of three times so far..and torn apart two 2.0 engines,,,(im not godly)!
  -i'm omnipotent!!  with small hands...German lineage, and  20 years
of continous ownership of the same damn car.  YOWZA  (well it's friday)

  OK, on your valve clearances, I adjust mine to .005 for intake, and
.006 for the exhaust.  I do this to keep 'em tight and reduce the
tappet noise...I have always adjusted my valves when the motor sounded
like it needed it.  I've never burned a valve, but i have enjoyed top
performance out of my machine for many years.
  I do this out of long-term experience with the same car ('73 2.0).
  The reason i vary from the books on this one point is i've learned
how to tailor the specs by FEEL.  An exhaust valve expands much more
during operation, so the larger clearance is needed (.006), an intake
valve expands less because of less heat (it gets quenched by the 
incomming fuel/air charge), so i give it a  .005  uh, thousandths.
  This is rather delicate, and i have had to go in and re-adjust
because i got it too tight...you will know if it happens.
  And if too tight you can burn a valve, but dont be paranoid.
  Your settings will work, but the tappet clatter is much greater, and
my experience has shown the valves usually loosen rather than tighten
from use.  Hi rpm running will loosen them almost instantly.
  I would say offhand, that .008 -.002 +.000 would be excellent.
  There is something to be said of technique too, it is easy to get
sloppy with the gauge while contorting your body to make the adjust.
  Best i can say is make yourself as comfortable as possible, and
pack a lunch -stay for a while!  Perhaps a moment of Yoga before 
climbing in..afterward head for the chiropractor.

  Have a better day,

I have an '84 944.  Its ignition timing is retarded suficiently to

with low octane fuel.  I recently switched to using high octane gas 
exclusively.
It seems that a modest HP gain could be realized by advancing the spark
somewhat.  Is this true and do any of the aftermarket chips provide this?

The early US 944 cars (through '87) had a relatively low compression ratio
(~9.7:1) presumably to allow the use of low octane petrol.  So, do the later
models, with their 10.5:1 CR require premium fuel, or does the DME
compensate enough to allow regular gas?

First of all, Weissach had nothing to do with those cars; they were  
designed and built by the production side of the house (albeit a special  
group).  As far as the race department at Porsche is concerned, they were  
not real race cars.  They had M030 rubber bushings in the suspension, for  
example, rather than solid or spherical bushings!  Their suspension was  
only slightly stiffer than the street car.

Secondly, at the risk of committing heresy in this group, what makes you  
think that the factory did any real analysis before adding the strut  
brace?  The rubber bushings at the strut top deflect much more than the  
strut tower ever would; the stress bar wasn't even straight, but had  
several bends in it; and the mounting scheme wasn't especially good.

The factory isn't always right.

The 928S4 started in 1987, and the "4" refers to the rev number of 928, not
the number of valves. The US version of the 928S had a 4-valve engine in
1985 and 1986, but the European version did not. Biggest cosmetic difference
is that rather than a lip spoiler on the back, there is a flat wing (tailights
also different looking) and the nose is smoothed out rather than having 
a flattish look.

Subject: RE: 951 Upgrades

Nathan et al,
	The Turbo Cup cars were definitely street based cars and I didn't 
mean to imply they were built at Weissach. However, I have to believe they 
did a lap or two around the test track at Weissach with these cars. Whether 
or not they did any testing with and without the front strut brace - who 
the heck knows.
	Further, I agree with your comment that Porsche's design of the TC 
brace was not very elegant. Both the  Camber Truss and the Weltmeister 
concepts are much better.
		Of course, the factory is not always right - look at their 
Indy car chassis - so it's not heresy to say so, but I believe the tower 
brace is better than nothing. Although there is deflection from the rubber 
bushings at the strut tops, any movement from the towers would be additive 
to it. Therefore worth preventing.  I assume your 951 SCCA pro car has the 
towers triangulated into a roll cage. Definitely the way to go. But that's 
not an alternative for stock class PCA Club Racing or for daily drivers. 
	So what's the bottom line?  I think that a strut tower brace isn't 
at the top of the list for 951 performance improvements. But on the track 
with sticky tires, higher spring rates, and large diameter sway bars you've 
got a lot of potential for chassis flex.  Anything you can legally do to 
prevent/ minimize it is worthwhile. And when that thing only costs a 
hundred buxs or so, I say do it.
	BTW Nathan, I for one would really like to hear what you've done to 
make your 951 into a real race car. Some of that story might be applicable 
to those of us tracking our cars and all of it would be interesting. Can I 
talk you into writing it up?

Subject: 88 951 problem (help!)



A little net wisdom please....
There might of been some related topics recently but not exactly
what my problem is.

OK
The Porsche: 

My 951 has been recently purchased for me and mine as a daily driver
and weekend warrior. It seems to be real fast, more than normal.
I have never driven another 944 turbo but this porsche seems as fast as
or faster than my 87 930?? is that possible?
My mechanic says it's not stock and that it is faster than normal but has said
he doesnt think anything on the inside was changed..ie. cam but that maybe
the chips or other things were done.

The Problem:
Under hard acceleration (foot to floor) in third gear at about 5,500 rpm
the motor cuts out. It feels like the fuel is being shut down or that
it's not getting any fuel..the fuel filter is only two months old.
If i keep my foot to the floor it starts to kick back in intermittedly
then if I let off the pedal push the clutch in and rev it up a little
then get back on it it's ok again but still will cut out just when
the boost is getting very strong at 5,500 it cuts out.

This also happens in fourth gear but at that point I'm going pretty fast..
This whole situation is a real bummer because we want to take it out on
the track ASAP.

Theory:
Could the fuel pump be bad?
Could the fuel pump not be able to handle the extra boost or what ever
the previous owner did to make it faster than stock (unconfirmed still)

Already tried:
My mechanic said he disconnected (i think) the oxygen sensor and it had alot 
less power but didnt seem to have the cut out problem.

Thanks in advance for any help!!

When this first showed up, I was on my way back from the Boston
Parade.  We were covering lots of miles each day and sometimes when we
would stop and the engine would need to idle, the 'looping' would
begin:  First the revs climb to up around 1500 rpm, then drop close to
zero - but not die - shaking the whole car (tach thought it was about
400 - 600 rpm), then the cycle would start over with the rpms climbing
once again.

A few things to note:  This only happened at idle.  I can't remember
sorting out temperature to relate this to.  Some B12 sprayed down the
tube/hose into the idle stabilizer helped - I still haven't replaced
the idle stabilizer yet - my mechanic says I should start thinking
about it.

Subject: Funny friday.....+ need advice.

Hi,

I'd just wanna give you guys an advice, based on my own experience, ......
NEVER EVER push your car out of the garage without connecting the tie rods, 
:) :) :)

Yesterday I did this, I was cleaning out the garage and decided to roll my 
'58 out. And I can tell you it was really funny(!?) how the car answered to 
my pushing, and the toe-in was +400mm to -400mm (degrees unknown) but it 
sure looked funny. My neighbour helped me pushing the car back in the garage 
after the clean out. He asked me if it was meant to be like that!!!

I'm stll laughing.... :) :) :)

I also have a request for advice rebuilding my ZF steering box, the conical 
'nut' that 'goes into' the worm is a bit out of tolerances, but if one could 
grind off some material in the end of it and smoothen out the surfaces 
afterwards, it could be inside tolerances again. Any advices or ideas are 
very welome.

cheers,
trond

Hi, Trond.
 
For $4000, you get a parts car here. Drivable cars start at maybe $6000.
While there are many cars with the usual pan and battery box rust, there are
also many California cars with original and rust-free (or minimally rusted)
chassis. Those start at perhaps $12,000. The car found by Bob Albrecht (no
relation) for $8000 sounds like a bargain.

Hi, Trond.
 
Remember when using lead, you must get ALL the rust off first. Sandblast or
use muriatic acid (a form of hydrochloric acid). Then you must get all the
acid off, using something like DuPont metal prep. Don't get acid into any
seams, you'll never get it out and it will be as bad as the rust you are
trying to get rid of.

Subject: Tiptronic Questions

As part of my Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing class here at
Washington University, we have a final project which involves designing
and programming an Expert System using CLIPS (Expert System Language).
For my project I have decided to design a 'smart' automatic transmission.
Obviously, Porsche has already done this, which is fine, my idea need not
be new for the project to be successful.  As part of this project I have
read the Dec 89 Panorama and Christophorus Nov 90 articles regarding the
Tiptronic transmission.  Now for my questions:

1)  How does it REALLY drive, is it as good as it sounds?

2)  Has anyone heard any substantial complaints?

3)  How successful was Porsche in selling Tiptronic equipped cars?

4)  Are there any other sources of information that I should read?

5)  I've heard that Valeo Automotive also has a similar system,
	does anyone know of any articles on their systems?

Thank you in advance to all who reply and I will obviously accept direct
replies because I am sure that a few years back this topic was thoroughly
discussed.

Subject:  85.2 944 not starting,

Hi guys, well in the continuing saga of my 944, I have encountered another
annoying problem, It wont start, I checked the battery connections, and
cleaned them, I checked all the ignition wires, from the coil to distributor,
and I checked the voltage across the battery when the car  was not
cranking(12.1 volts) and when the car was cranking(11.3 volts) so I think it
has enough  voltage, the starter motor runs or rather hums, and I can hear
the ignition relays click when I try to start it, I dont know if the solenoid
is making the right noise Ive never payed attention to how it sounds, so what
do you guys think???
what could be the problem,
can the starter and/or solenoid be rebuilt? does anyone want to buy my car?:)
Thanks

RE 911SC RS, the last one I saw for sale had an asking price of
around $150K.. Btw, a while ago in Panorama, someone was selling SC
RS exhaust systems to upgrade your SC or Carrera.  I think the cost
was around $2-2.5K.


Is there any problem with using Cool Carbon's with cross-drilled
rotors.  My S came with cross drilled rotors all around....I am a
little worried about the extra heat causing cracking.

Subject: 89 951 questions (new owner)



The wife and I have recently purchased 89 951 (38k mi.). We have
participated in Porsche driver schools in the past, so we plan
on tracking this car.

chipping: I have talked to alot of people at the track who own 951s
          and it seems everyone chips these cars. I found it
          interesting that those with Autothoritys chips recommend
          that the head gasket bolts be replaced with stronger ones
          but others who do not use Autothority chips said they have
          not had any problems at all. There was a posting in the last
          digest email that a very good source for chips was "John
          Milledge Engineering" does anyone have a phone number or
          address for this company?

tires:	  Currently we are running stock tires and rims. I would like
          to purchase another set of rims for track use, but would like
          to know if I can go to a larger tire size and what those sizes
          would be. Can I purchase 17" rims for this car? Is 245 front
          and 275 rear to large for this particular make?

exhaust:  In the recent issue of Excellence Magazine there was a article
          about exhaust systems on turbo cars and that if you track them
          its not a bad idea to replace the catalytic converter with a
          straight pipe during tracktime. The logic was that you save
          burning up the catalytic converter do to extremely high temps
          during track use. Any comments on this. Considering the cost
          of a new catalytic converter this sounds like good advice.

brakes:   I cannot believe a car that is five years old has this kind of
          stopping power!! I test drove a 93 RX7 and the 951 is right
          there with it for stopping power, amazing. One problem I do
          have is excessive break squeal, very annoying. Any ideas on how
          to quit these babies down. I have about 90% pad left in the front
          and 75% in the rear.

turbo:    One of the nice features about this car is it has a kind of turbo
          cooling system that comes on when the car is shutdown hot. I
          was wondering if there is any kits out there to gain control of
          this system to force it to run longer, maybe a override switch or
          timer.

cooling:  In the Performance catalog they list two products; a fan temperature
          sensor for the electric fan that comes on 25 degrees lower than the 
          factory one and a lower temperature thermostat sensor. Any comments
          on the advantages of these products?

Thanks for the input

Subject: Started 944, wheel bearing change,

I solved the problem with the 944 and got it started, apparently the little
rubber boots that shield the contacts on the solenoid had come off and a
thick coat of black gook had formed and prevented a good contact, I took off
the wires cleaned all the contacts and then reinstalled them then finished by
coating them over with rtv to keep the problem from occuring in the near
future, while I was at it and since i hadnt done it yet I changed the front
left wheel bearings the wheel had much play so I did the  left first, the
problem whirring noise was still there so I changed the right side as well,
that wheel was pretty tight, but the bearings were in very bad shape, the
whole job was so easy there is no excuse not to just open those little
suckers up and repack them just to be safe, BTW I used the new euro select
brand of bearings and I feel that although they may be a little cheaper, OEM
is much better, THANKS for all the input on these problems,

Sam,

I'd probably pack the connection with dielectric grease rather than
using RTV.  It's easier to get back at the nut as needed, and less
likely to trap moisture which wicks into the junction.

Just my tuppence; glad your car's back to life.
