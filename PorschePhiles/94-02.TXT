Subject: stuck torsion bars

Dear Mike, 
 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like the torsion bars are stuck in the 
splines of the spring plate?  If this is so, you got a problem.  When I last 
did my torsion bars, I had a little trouble getting them out.  What I did is 
drenched the contacts with WD-40, let it sit overnight.  This was enough to 
free one side but the other proved a little more difficult.  My next move was 
to pull the assembly out from the car and wedge a couple of short pieces of 2x4 
behind it.  After applying another liberal libation of WD-40, I then, using a 
coal chisel and a hammer, tapped the end of the torsion bar until it came free. 
 
If this doesn't work for you, I would suggest possibly trying to heat the 
spring plate but no promises there. 
 
I hope you can get this fixed.  If you have to use a hacksaw, you'll probably 
be on your back for about a month.

Maynard,

>seen (if any) by replacing the chip on a 
>normally aspirated 944.

Minimal.  Between the factory's tendency to underspec the car's power,
and AutoThority's, uh, positive outlook, perhaps none.  If you just
*have* to buy a chip, try finding a used one.  I got mine from a guy
who was selling his car, and the new owner had no use for the chip. 
AutoThority was quite agreeable when asked about transferring warranty.

>  Also, what are the 
>differences between the Weltmeister Chips and
>the Autothority chip/MFS combination?  

Dunno about the Weltmeisters, but would be interested in hearing folks
experiences with that and other brands, esp. the line advertised in
"911 & Porsche World."

With respect to the mass-flow claims, I am extremely doubtful.  It just
makes no sense to me, to think that the fraction of a second it takes a
barn door to snap open affects performance.  Ditto for the hogged out
throttle bodies they sell.

>Are they worth the investment and does your car
>become street 'illegal' after the modification?

Not worth the investment, except in a turbocharged car.  I believe that
except for the 944 Turbo, the AutoThority chips are legal for street
use nowadays.  Perhaps someone better informed can confirm this.

In thinking about all this, keep in mind something my-friend-the-mechanic
reminded me of a few days ago:  The factory engineers really know their
stuff and do a really good job of it.  They have no reason to leave power
on the table, and they don't.

Subject: Velocity stacks

Dear Stan, 
 
1) I called GT Racing, but have been unable to get through to them. 
 
2) With regard to stack height, that's what I thought.  But these stacks have a 
very gradual taper that Murry at Black Forest Eng. assured me gives it response 
across a wide range of engine speeds.  This makes sense because you figure that 
the resonance will be established at the natural length.  Therefore you may not 
get the maximum effect at lower engine rpms than if it was tuned for that 
specific valve resonance, however, the gradual taper will give some enhancement 
of air-flow.  This is what I want because in auto-X where I really need the 
power is coming out of a slow corner where the engine revs about 3k. 
My first chance to take them on the track is 2/26/94.  However, I did take them 
bombing around an empty parking lot on Sunday and the bottom end response did 
feel better (psychological?).  Now, I claim sense (maybe?), not experience. 
I'm rather new to this engine performance thing.  I'd like to here your 
thoughts on the matter. 
 
3) Now the question of main jets have come up.  Murry suggests running 0.150 or 
0.160's.  I presently have 0.130's in the solexes PII-4's (this car is 
standard, not big bore).  When I bounced this off Dwight Mitchell, my local 
Porsche expert, he expressed extreme doubt about going to anything that big. 
What do you think?

Hey folks, let's ease up on Mr. Pellow a little bit!  I for one 
have thoroughly enjoyed der Maestro's wit and whimsy both in 
person and as a Gentle Reader of the Good Books.  Perhaps you're 
all interpreting his writing style just a little too seriously.  

He's not a racer and has little to offer the high-performance 
crowd.  He's also not a concours purist, although he does judge 
concours events.  Some of his engines and prose wouldn't win any 
awards for aesthetics.  His reactionary sociopolitical digressions 
are entertaining, even ifn I don't agree with him.  

However, I have learned alot from his books, which contain a huge 
amount of useful and scarce information, if you're willing to plow 
through the patter, which is occaisionally very, very funny.  I 
have enjoyed and benefitted from many genuinely helpful 
conversations with the man.  His engineer's approach is refreshing 
and usually sound.  In spite of all the recent and unkind 
criticism, I have yet to see this group cite a specific example of 
incorrect technical information attributable to Mr. Pellow.

Subject: 85 911 - QUESTIONS

I've been on the list for a few weeks. I'm amazed at the knowledge
out there! In order to conserve bandwidth, I've compiled an
assortment of questions. Next time I promise not to be as long-winded.
Thanks in advance for everyone's help.

(1) I'm having trouble setting the CIS adjustment on my '85 911. When I
purchased the car, I noticed that the O2 sensor was disconnected.
According to my local shop, some of the cars "run best" that way.
While the car is smooth and strong, it of course does not pass
emissions (2 % CO, 220 PPM HC) and has less than great fuel economy
(20 mpg). When I connect the sensor, emissions drop to 0 on both
CO and HC, mileage improves to about 24 mpg, but the car "surges"
at constant throttle. Thinking that the mixture was too lean I
turned the adjustment screw clockwise, eventually hitting the stop.
Still, no improvement. Any suggestions? BTW, the stats are from the
local state emmisions shop. No, I don't have my own analyzer.
Would be nice though....

(2) I need to replace my Boge shocks - they're leaking. I use the car
as my daily driver. I may run the car in some drivers ed events this
summer, but I doubt that I'll go much further right away. Should I get
Boge again? Bilsteins? Konis?

(3) The cruise control is "rough", i.e., it oscillates around the set
speed. I'd guess it varies +- 3 mph every 5-10 seconds. I've checked
for slop in the actuator linkage, and it looks OK. I called a California
shop that advertises cruise control repairs in Excellence. They say
the "op-amps" are probably bad, and can recondition the control unit
for $160. Does that sound plausible?

(4) Factory Workshop manuals. Yikes they are expensive. But, my Haynes
manual is pretty bad. (I have a new Bentley manual for my wife's Saab -
it's quite comprehensive.) It looks like I would have to get the volumes
covering my Carrera, and then ALL the previous manuals. I don't have my
catalogs with me, but I think we're talking 11 volumes at $300-500.
Any alternatives?

(5) I'm still learning about maintenance and repairs. My current reading  list
includes Panorama + Upfixin, Excellence, and European Sports Car.
I also may be getting the racing bug, and have started to read
Grassroots Motorsports (I think that's the title, left the copy at home).
Are there any other mags of interest out there?

(6) Anyone going to the Dixie-Tech session in Huntsville Alabama next
month? It's fairly near to me (Atlanta) so I think I'll check it out.

Thanks for everyone's help!!

Another good source is Upfixin' Der Porsche, a collection of Panorama
how-to articles (or am I getting my titles mixed up?).  Anyways, as to the
main point of my response, I feel somewhat mixed about Pellow.  When I had
my 912, I learned a lot about the car from reading Pellow's books, mixed
in of course with a lot of humor, some good, a lot lame.  I enjoyed the
sort of 'shade tree, experienced mechanic talking over his shoulder as he
works on an engine' sort of atmosphere.  Taken with a grain of salt, there
was a lot of good information in them.  Definitely not a no-nonsense
technical manual, more like a low-budget Zen of Porsche Repair.  It was
the entertainment I valued almost more than the hard information. 
Especially when I viewed some of the videotapes, at the end of which were
five minutes or so of some cop show.

Anyways, while I don't feel as vehemently anti-Pellow as some of the
others here, neither do I consider him quite the 356 god he does.  'Legend
in his own mind'?  For me, having a hard time reading through technical
manuals from cover to cover without copping a few good snoozes, it was an
enjoyable way to pick up the basics of 356/912 engines.  Others here may
have dealt with him on a more (or less on Pellow's part) professional basis,
and may have garnered some negative experiences from it.

    Mike-

    First of all, if you can, check the archives because a few months
    back (starting in July or so) I disucssed this topic with a few
    others- I think there should be some valuable info there for you.

    Secondly, put your hacksaw away (as well as other sharp objects,
    and please step away from the edge!).  I really don't think you or
    the 6 Million Dollar Man could hack through a torsion bar, but
    have at it if you think you can.  On a more serious note, try
    drilling a hole in the end cap (outside end of the torsion bar) of
    the spring plate.  Then spray some Kroil in there (this stuff is
    fantastic- if anyone needs their address, let me know and I'll
    post it- unless you have a 1994 Turbo or a car kept in a bag full
    of Argon gas, everyone should have a supply of this stuff on
    hand).  After letting the Kroil seep and do its job, pull the
    whole assembly out (PARTIALLY disengage the inner end of the
    torsion bar) by about .5"- 1".  Then place a piece of wood between
    the spring plate and the bolt holes.  Take a long punch and a
    hammer and use your hacksaw energy to drive the torsion bar back
    into the center of the car.  If all works well, the bar will move
    inwards and the spring plate will stay out (it helps to have
    another set of hands to hold the wood and spring plate, but it is
    not necessary).  I am not sure if heat will help here, but if all
    the hammering doesn't work (depending on how seized the thing
    is, it may take alot of banging), you might try heating the cap up
    and then hammering.

    Also, on the subject of rubber bushing removal, Scott Jessen had
    the great suggestion of burning the buggers off- and yes, it works
    great (by the way, thanks again Scott).

    Hope this helps.

Subject: Trond's 356 questions

Hi, Trond.
 
On your '63 B, you have gotten far enough into your A to know where to look
for rust, and if the repair is good enough or not. It sounds like most of
the B problems are minor -- need a carburetor rebuild, maybe a tach rebuild,
general cleaning and replacing and repair. If the car runs and is rust-free,
$10,000 is a fair (maybe slightly high) price in the U.S. If one searches
long enough one might find such a car for $8000.
 
Of course if the engine was rebuilt by Pellow subtract $2000 for the cost of
a proper rebuild ;-)
 
I just cut most of the floor out of my daily driver 356. There were a few
rust holes in the center, the ribbing was flattened, and it was bowed down
from 30 years of use. But the floor is still good where it attaches to the
rear floor, the longitudinal, the tunnel, and the front area. These can be
difficult to weld nicely, so I merely cut a hole about 30 x 45 cm. I intend
to butt-weld a patch into the hole, then grind the weld so that no repair is
visible even without undercoat and rubber mat. To do this, I first went to
the lumber yard and had them cut a piece of very high grade particle board
(Ikea quality? :-)  )  6 mm thick and with the exact dimensions of the hole.
Then I drilled small 3 mm holes, 2 cm from the edge, about 5 cm apart. I
laid this board, which will serve as a pattern, onto the floor, drilled
through the floor and used Cleco clamps (used in aircraft industry to hold
aircraft skins in place while riveting) to clamp pattern to the floor. Then
I used my secret weapon -- a German oscillating saw, made by Fein in
Stuttgart. It is really a sander, made to get into 90 degree corners, but
you can put a round saw blade in it. The saw leaves only an 0.5 mm cut,
perfect for welding. Much smaller than using a cutoff wheel. Anyway, once
the floor was cut, I put the cutout piece on the new floor and cut out the
patch. Now I am waiting for a special fine torch before welding. The fit is
perfect.
 
Until then, I am driving the Flintstonemobile (Do you know the Flintstone
Family? Old cartoon, Fred, Wilma, Barney, Betty, they live in the Stone Age.
The Germans call them Familie Feuerstein. Fred Flintstone's car is made of
two tree trunks, and motive power is Fred's feet coming out the bottom.)

Subject: need a word (con rod)

Hi, Stan.
 
The correct word is Pleuelstange (plural Pleuelstangen). Note German nouns
are capitalized. Often it's just shortened to "Pleuel."
 
Pleuellagerzapfen is not the correct translation. It translates literally
to "connecting rod bearing pin," or what we would call the crankpin (on the
crankshaft.)
 
Just to see whether the German factory manuals use P..stange or just Pleuel,
I did pull out my Carrera manual and they use the full word.
 
Speaking of translations, I just got a copy of the latest 911 book from
Germany, Tobias Aichele, "Porsche 911 -- Forever young" (yes, that's the
German title). 389 pages, lots of color, lots of factory diagrams. Aichele
got a job at the PR department after writing this book. My former next door
neighbor in Weissach did the technical section with specs and all. Anyway,
it looks like this will be the best 911 history yet, and that I will do the
translation. Publisher will be Brett Johnson (of 356, 914, and 911

Covering Greg and Eric's comments... And Eric, you really don't need
the Nomex...

First, let me go on record with what I've been saying privately for a
long time: Pellow is a fine fellow, very affable and entertaining,
and would probably make a good after dinner speaker or be fun to sit
around to drink beer and swap stories with. Some of his material is
accurate, some is not; sort of like Rush, if you *know* that it's supposed
to be entertainment and not gospel truth, you're OK. Problem is, when he
says he's "The Maestro", and you believe him...

And I'll also note that I get my 356 knowledge from hands-on, both
engine and chassis work to prepare cars for street/autox/etc, and 
ground up restorations. My mentor in this is the only person I know
with *factory training* on the 356 (pushrod and 4-cam), 904, 906, and 
early 911s, particularly who got to use any of it racing these cars.
Sort of different than picking it up in the streets or thinking that
VW beetle == 356 for most purposes...

I *like* this book. It is very useful, particularly since it does have
pictures along with part numbers. When you have a box of J-random 356 parts
and need to know what they are (assuming you *don't* have this stuff in your
head...) it's a good reference.

This is hard, because my Pellow books are in Houston and my fingers
are in NJ... In the books, it's hard to recall things that are
dangerously inaccurate, but then the real place to look would
be in his engine rebuild book, which I haven't even pulled off the
shelf in several years... *HOWEVER*, his video tapes have *LOTS* of
dangerously wrong stuff -- using the wrong tool for the job on a
few places where it matters, beating on the wrong part of the case to
split an engine, no emphasis on cleaning the parts correctly nor any
hints as to how one might do that, out of sequence operations that 
leave you going "ok, how the hell do I get *that* in *there* now..."

>He's not a racer and has little to offer the high-performance 
>crowd.  He's also not a concours purist, although he does judge

If you want the performance view, Duanne Spencer's "The 356 Performance
Handbook" is a must-have. *HOWEVER*, it is from a vintage racer 
viewpoint, so be warned that it *assumes* you already know a lot.

If you want concours, then our buddy Brett Johnson, DMV, has the 
answer in his "Restorer's Guide to Authenticity" series. And of
course, the Harvey and Linda Smith articles in Excellence and The Registry...

If you want to turn your own bolts, get the Elfrink "Porsche Tech and 
Service Manual" or whatever the name really is. Sort of the Haynes
manual of it's day, has very good procedure where they bother to give
details (particularly on a T6, "remove gas tank" is *NOT* real instructive...)
And of course, the factory manuals, which only run a few hundred
dollars for the 356... My new T6 manual was only like $155 or so.

Again, the problem with Harry is his pedantic style. His anecdotes
have all sorts of useful info about failure modes and bonehead moves
that you can make as the owner of one of these cars. It's just sort
of sad that the highest and best purpose of both his books and tapes is
to let someone that really knows this stuff use them as counterexamples

Subject: Air Flow Sensors

Would anyone who is pushing the hot-wire airflow sensor care to cite the
actual improvement in air flow that results?  I have a CIS car, i.e. 
not directly comparable to Motronic, and I admit that hanging
"flappers" (mechanical or electronic) in the airflow isn't the best
solution.  **BUT**, I also have a manifold vacuum gauge, and it goes
right down to zero inches (i.e. manifold pressure = atmospheric
pressure) and stays there to redline when the pedal is to the metal.  So
maybe my gauge misses the last inch of vacuum or so, but still, we're
only talking about a few percent of head loss here.  Or so it seems to
me.  Not, IMHO, $1700 worth of head loss...

Now if you want to talk no-moving-parts reliablility, or dynamic
response, or what is a better (and probably cheaper) scheme for a new
car to come with, then I agree hot-wire is an elegant way to go.  It
just doesn't seem like a $1700 retrofit.  (Sorry to keep harping on that
number, someone posted it and I went with it...)

     Are you aware that the heater works fine without the blower
(at speeds above an idle)?  Just remove the blower and cover the
resulting hole with an appropriate piece of sheet metal.  You
will also need to tie the blower shroud to something to keep it
from rattling around.  Then you can do what I'm doing, which is
to procrastinate about spending a couple hundred or so for
something that does very little, clutters the engine compartment,
and weighs about 5 lbs.

Subject: Monthly Update

February 1994

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

The survey is coming along nicely, thanks for your help! Right now, 
there are responses from 405 people, meaning the 198 slackers out there
need to get it in gear and respond! If you've lost your copy of the survey
questions, they're up for FTP...

Having been one-up'd by Mark Bradakis of Team.Net, the Porschehiles WWW
server is going up even as we speak.... You'll be able to use it to
access the archives, the who's who (including gifs of you or your car(s)
if you send them in...), and Other Cool Stuff. Access is best through
NCSA Mosaic, so if you don't have a copy and you are using an X based
workstation, a Windows machine, or a Mac *that is directly on the Internet*
you should get a copy. I'll post a mini-tutorial once it's up.

The index for the images archive is now current, too. The index is only a
few hundred bytes; the images are close to 10 meg. Please download the
index to see what you want instead of just taking all the images....

And that's about it from the frozen north...

I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 7 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070..

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Chris Mackay mentions substituting an .050 distributor for the infamous .009.
If you wonder why people buy them look at the Automotion catalog.  For some
strange reason they offer them as a performance item!!  Anyway, Duane Spencer,
in his book recommends the .031 for high performance use and says the .050,
with the same advance curve is fine for the street.  Do you guys agree?  The
.031 is certainly much more expensive.

I'm goming to presume that the chip is down to the bare metal for this
process.  First, get some items to help you with the job:

	small bit of primer, compatible with the paint on your car
	color matched paint
	A very sharp #2 pencil with unused eraser on the end
	two or three extra pencils with unused erasers
	double sided tape or contact cement (cc preferred)
	600 grit wet/dry sandpaper
	320 grit wet/dry sandpaper
	220 grit wet/dry sandpaper
	some organic cleaner (simple green works great)
	a couple of cotton tipped q-tips, paper shafts required
	optionally a magnifying glass
	spray cleaner (Aero Kroil is the best I've found) or rubbing alcohol
	empty shoe box bottom, cut to fit over area with chip.
	Polishing compund (not rubbing compound)
	cloth diaper if possible, or lint free terry cloth rag


Carefully clean the chipped area with the undiluted organic cleaner and
examine the edges of the chip to see if they are loose edges to the chip.
Probe the area carefully with the sharpened pencil point (the graphite point
is soft enough to not damage the paint edges, and will come off with the
alcohol or spray cleaner easily with out rubbing) to look for areas that are
lifting up.  Make mental notes if any areas exist, or if possible, remove
them.

Cut a small circle of 220 grit sandpaper and glue it to the eraser on the
pencil.  Attach some 320 grit sandpaper to another pencil, repeat with 600
you'll need both of these soon, so do them all together.  Use this to
carefully roughen up the edges of the chip and the exposed bare metal.  Use 
the spray cleaner to remove the dust particles.  The spray cleaners have a 
high rate of evaporation, so should not interfere with the paint.

Use the 320 to roughen up about a small area of paint outside the chip, about
3 or 4 millimeters should be enough.  Use the spray cleaner to remove the
dust.

Carefully pull _most_ of the cotton off one end of the swab.  Just a minor
bit is needed since you are using the paper shaft as well to apply paint.
Dip the prepared end into the primer about 5 mm and dab the paint into the
chip.  Start at the center to create a dome of paint and pull it out to the
edges.  If there were loose edges of paint, try to get the primer under them
as well as coating most of the roughened up paint.  Leave about 1 mm of
exposed roughened paint around the primer.  The coat should be very thin.
If the first drop didn't cover the chip completely, in the next step, dip the
swap deeper into the paint.  But don't over do it.  It is much better to have
too little paint in a layer than too much.  Probably another 3 mm is enough.
Allow 2 hours to dry (!).  You'll thank me later that you waited this long.
take the shoe box and make sure that it can easily cover the area you just
put paint on, trim it if needed to fit better.  I use my car cover to hold it
in place.  This keeps the dust out while the paint is drying.

Once the paint is dry, use 600 grit to roughen up the surface and reapply
another dallop of primer in the same manner.  Let it dry another 2 hours.

Once the paint is dry, use 600 grit to roughen up the surface if you can see
bare metal in the scratches, repeat the previous steps one more time.
Usually two coats is enough however.

This time apply the color paint in the same manner, dip the sheared swab
about 5mm into the paint, and place a drop in the center of the chip, then
pull it out to cover the chip entirely.  Spread out the paint to cover all
the area that is roughened up.  Don't worry if you go over the area, it will
be removed later.  This layer of paint should be very thin, perhaps not even
obscuring the scratches or some of the primer.  That's ok.  Cover it with
your shoebox, and let it dry for 2 hours.

Add another drop of paint and spread it out to cover the chip.  The secret to
this method is that you should never redip the swab when applying a layer of
paint.  If the chip is larger, dip the swab deeper into the paint this time,
but only a little bit.  Don't worry if the chip is not covered with paint
yet, follow the same method you did with the primer and each successive layer
adds a bit more paint to the initial drop, until the area covered is the
right size.  Again let this layer dry for at least 2 hours.

Repeat the spreading drop of paint, 2 hour drying time, a number of times.
The idea is to make the combined layers of paint ever so thicker than the
painted surface of your car.  I predict for a chip that is to bare metal, you
will need about 2 coats of primer and 8 to 10 coats of paint.  As always,
more layers won't hurt, it just takes a lot more time.  The 2 hours between
coats is imperiative.  DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP.

By now you should have a small blister of paint a fraction of a millimeter
thicker than the paint job on your car.  Let the last coat dry about a week
before doing the next step.  Really.

Wrap the diaper around your index finger and make sure the tip is covered.  
Use this to apply a small amount of polishing compound to the ex-chip, and
polish the area in small circular motions.  Use a clean area of diaper when
the diaper is paint colored.  Examine the blister of paint to see if it is
blended in to the correct layer yet.  Once it is, clean your car like normal.
Then wax it with a good hard wax of your choice.

Yes this is a labor intensive process, but when you consider how much money a
new paint job is going to cost, its pretty minor.  I have used this method
many time (unfortunantly) and you would be hard pressed to find the chips on
the front of my car, even though it's black lacquer, the worst offender for
chipping and showing blemishes.

There are a few books besides the "ABCs of drivel":

Duane Spencer's book: The 356 Handbook (a la 911 Handbook) is an excellent

Another good book which was pre-pellow and probably out of print is: How to

My main problem with Pellow is he doesn't walk the talk!  All his drivel about

Subject: 911 advice needed


Hi everyone, my 88 911 3.2 is steering very slightly to the
the left. The effect becomes more pronounced under braking.
I took the car to my dealer, who `tested' it, and for reasons
that I can't imagine felt that the problem was caused by 
"glazed pads" and charged me 120 GBP to clean up the front calipers,
disks and pads. When I got the car back, the leftward steering
was unchanged, ie very slight but still there.

I hit a traffic island at moderate speed in this car last year,
it needed a complete front suspension rebuild, new front wheels and
tyres etc. The steering components where undamaged, and I was assured that
the impact was not sufficient to require the car to go on a jig
to be straightened. All the work was carried out by Porsche at
vast expense.

My feeling is that if the shop can't accurately diagnose why a
911 is driving to the left, then they probably won't have been able
to get the geometry of the front end set up in the first place.
Even worse is the underlying feeling that the damage was more significant
and not picked up at the time. Is it possible to setup the front end
geometry for a car that has a displaced shock tower or something 
similar, and not notice that there is a problem?

Does anyone have any advice on the technical aspects of this problem?

When the car goes back to the dealer, i want to ask them to check
a specific list of things. What should I ask them to check, and what
typical values should I be looking for them to report (ie camber, caster,
toe-in etc etc from the front suspension)? BTW I am a software person
and not a mechanical engineer, so only have a sketchy understanding of the
techniques of suspension geometery so go easy on me.

Thanks everyone, especially Stan for providing the excellent forum.

(PS thanks for the great reponse on my posting about changing
gas struts on my 911. The reponse and detailed knowledge from the
group was overwhelming. Such a lot of knowledge about one tiny pcar 
component)

    The Lambda sensor (O2 sensor) is there to keep the mixture correctly set. 
Tweaking the knob just perturbs the system a little so that the "brain" has to
compensate.  Therefore, no change.  Your sensor may be faulty, I don't know how
you check without getting a new one.  However-- the Bosch FI book by Probst
describes a procedure for dilaing in your mixture open-loop (with the sensor
disconnected) using the sensor and a multimeter.  Good book, I recommend it.

I don't think I have time for the whole thing, but was thinking about
dashing up for one evening, particularly if we can get a "critical mass"
of 'philes there for the evening...

So, who's planning to go, or who lives in the area can could come by
for a beer or something??? 

BTW, date is like March 4-5 or some such...

Subject: more clutch woes?

Hi... I'm the guy who thought I burned my '69 912 clutch.  The smell went
away after a couple of days.  But... I've developed a ghastly sound
akin to - well, I don't know how to describe it well...

When engaging the clutch (in 1st or reverse), I hear a momentary 
scraping/moaning sound that also telegraphs somewhat through the gearshift 
and clutch pedal.  I _also_ hear the sound (although quieter) when slowly 
upshifting from first to second with the clutch fully depressed.

The clutch is definitely not slipping.  Two careful speed shifts from 2nd
to 4th have me convinced there is no slippage.

The transmission fluid level and is fine.  The oil is nearly clear - looks 
'healthy' like fresh crankcase oil (which I changed three weeks ago, and
it looks okay, too).

What could this be?  What tests could I perform to isolate the cause of
the sound?

Subject: Re: lots of questions

>(1) I'm having trouble setting the CIS adjustment on my '85 911...

No CIS on the Carreras, boss... They're all DME where troubleshooting gets
interesting indeed... Could be a "bad brain", or a bad connector,
or a bad sensor (there are several). Remember, you're tracking data
as well as power and control now...

I catch a lot of grief for this, but I like KYBs. They're *cheap*, 
they work well for "normal" use and pump up (i.e. each successive rebound
the shock gets harder) which make them good for limited autox/track use
too. (by limited, I mean "not real frequent, car not real prepared").

Could also be related to the EFI problem --- they share a lot of the
same data.

BTW, there *IS* a beastie called the "DME testing plan" which may be 
available from the dealer as a seperate item. Worth having, if you
do much work on your EFI.

Oh, let's see... For the Carrera, you need 

  1) the "base set" -- covers '65-71 

  2) the "supplement" -- in this case, the '72-83 *AND* '84-89 sets

  3) the "updates" -- which are sent out by PCNA to dealers, "subscribers",
     etc. -- you want to make sure your manual set has the most current
     updates possible, or you may miss vital info. You *CAN* buy updates
     separately, and back in the Old Days, the PCA made updates available
     to members for cheap.

Well, there is the *excellent* Brit pub "911 and Porsche World", which
has lots of info from the UK. Handy stuff, particularly if you have a Euro
car in the first place (like I do...). And if you're thinking "racing",
then you  need to think about what kind. Autocross, and there is 
Grassroots Motorsports *and* North American Pylon. There is also
a similar group on the Internet - Team.Net. Send your subscription
requests to "autox-request@autox.team.net". If you're thinking
*real* racing, then there is SCCA, PCA Club Racing, and Vintage Racing.
Each have their own set of publications...

Good luck!

Ok, now you've done.  Thrown down the gauntlet.  

Yes I have an opinion.

You should set your limited slip for 60% lockup.  Lockup's above 70% show
understeer characteristics on corner entry at the track (which we can
sometimes live with, but more driving skill is required).  

The Quaife is the answer.  It has continously variable torque splits
depending on the amount of traction available.  It's turn in is like an
open-diff, very easy and predictable.  It is robust, doesn't require
adjustment (the extra cost will be recovered in 2 or 3 adjustments (3 yrs?). 
I put one in my 914-6 race car, and the difference was unbelievable.

The Quaife will fail under one circumstance, and that is if one wheel is
completely unloaded (ie. it's off the ground).  Avoid this.  It works for me.

Bonus for 944/951 Owners:
Since you read this far, and you now need a Quaife for your 944, I know where
a few extras are available.  My mechanic, Jeff Chandler
(Jeff_Chandler@onenet-bbs.org, 303-444-2585), has 944/951 Quaife's in stock
for $1395.  (about $100 less than AutoThority!)

He can build a complete 944 /951 transmission for you with short gears,
Quaife, etc.   He races this setup in his 944 ITS race car, and was
undefeated in four starts this past season, coming within a tenth or so of a
few track records with a brand new car.  Give him a call.

Well, "some of the cars run best that way" sounds like the guy's using
you to practice his first order predicate calculus.  But seriously, this
sounds like it may be an air leak into the exhaust.  Look for a broken
or pulled exhaust stud or head stud.

As lambda sensors get old, they also get "lazy", by which I mean they
respond slowly to exhaust gas oxygen.  This may also be the cause of
your surging: slow response and therefore slow cycling.

Could also be a vacuum leak.

Hope this helps.

A few years ago I bought a used 66 911 that was partially restored.
The engine and transmission had been rebuilt but the body and other
mechanical parts needed repair.  I completed the job with the exception of
getting the speedometer to function.

It seems the mechanic who rebuilt the transmission either forgot the speedo
gear or forgot to install it in he correct location.  The cable and gauge
work OK, its just nothing's driving it.

Does anyone have any suggestions other than pulling the engine&transmission
and cracking the trans to fix the problem?

Subject: 911 Rear Torsion Bar Spring rates

As I mentioned the other day, I calculated
the spring rates for 911 rear torsion bars.
The units for these rates are a little screwy,
but if you think about it, they make sense.  It 
may be most useful to use these as a comparison
between your particular bars and other sizes
(to note the % increase or decrease in stiffness).

Anyway here they are:

Bar DIA             Spring rate

23 mm               552 in-lbs/degree
24.1 mm            665 in-lbs/degree
25 mm               770 in-lbs/degree
26 mm               901 in-lbs/degree
27 mm               1048 in-lbs/degree
28 mm               1212 in-lbs/degree
30 mm               1598 in-lbs/degree

To put these into real-life terms, 690 lbs of force
applied at the rear tire of a 69-77 911 (approximately
the weight of the vehicle at that point) will result in about 19
degrees of rotation of the torsion bar which is about
6.4 inches of suspension movement. 

If anyone wants to pick this apart further, just
contact me...

Subject: 356 Distributors

The advance curve for the .009 is wrong for *EVERYTHING* except the
VW Type I without doghouse oil cooler. Everyone uses them, however,
because some ya-hoo at one of the Bugs-R-Kool type mags wrote a long
time ago that this was the hot setup for performance VWs, and over time
entropic effect reduced that to the .009 "obviously" being the hot
setup for all air-cooled 4 cylinder engines.

Remember that discussion earlier in the week about believing stuff
just because you read it? Another case in point...

Anyway, yes, the .050 is *almost* as good as the stock distributor for the
356/912 for street use. For performance use you have other problems --
remember, Duanne is talking about racing engines, and as a result has
a different bias! The .031 is a good choice for some performance applications
because it has a lot of advance and it comes in at about the right times.
Don't overgeneralize that to the point of saying it's right for everything...

Personally, I use SC distributors on most everything... Right now, I'm
working with someone to make a recurve kit for .050s that will give the
*right* advance and curve, but for a hell of a lot less than a new
correct distributor.

Subject: 951 Waterpump Woes

My '87 951 has succumbed to water pump failure so I've called around for 
prices on rebuilt units.  Each vendor has a revision part number:
 
Perf Products  	$150	951.106.021.04	
Automotion	$139	951.106.021.08R 	(FYI: 20% SALE IN FEB)
Europroducts	$139	951.106.021.16X
Jay Pineau	$150	claims revised part #s irrelevant for rebuilt units, 
			different castings?, "cosmetic" not functional??
Dealer		$257	951.106.921V (That's 921 not 021!)
		Dealer-supplied kit included thermostat and gaskets.

1. What is the most current number?  Of course, the dealer says his is.  I'd 
assume the most recent revision would be desirable, as in software purchases? 

2. Do I really need the special tensioning tool for the belts?   The archives 
were not conclusive. Any other special tools?   Dealer says they don't use 
it, they do it by 'feel'.  Find another specialist who uses it?
 
Since dealer charges $67.50 for retensioning, I'm considering changing pump 
myself to save $450 labor and have a specialist retension the belts.  What are 
the consequences of incorrect tension?  Same as broken belt?

3. Anything else to change, adjust while everything's apart?

4. Dealer quoted 10 hours labor barring broken studs.  For someone doing this 
for the first time, is this realistic?  I may get help from a mechanic friend 
(not a Porsche specialist but rebuilding a 2.7 911 motor) with a lift/air

Subject: 951/Brembo Brake Problem

Greetings,
	I'm using my '89 951 mainly for PCA Club Racing and drivers ed 
track stuff. As a heavy car with a fair amount of power, the brakes take a 
beating. This car on the front has calipers made by the Italian company 
Brembo specifically for Porsche. I think initially they were made for the 
928S4 , then put on the Turbo Cup 944s and then on the '88 944Tubo 
S.	
	To clean up and rebuild these calipers I innocently took the 
caliper halves apart. It definitely made the job much easier. Subsequently 
I got hold of the factory workshop manual for the 951 which says in bold 
text that one should NOT take these calipers apart. They are held together 
with 4 socket head cap screws, which on assembly are torqued PAST their 
yield point. The manual says that "special equipment", unavailable to 
common man, is needed to duplicate this.
	I can't see throwing away these very expensive calipers because of 
4 bolts. The Brembo US office can't (won't) help me. There's got to be some 
commercially available hi-strength bolts that, properly torqued, would do 
just fine. 
	Can anybody on the net offer any advice/solution?

Subject: RE: 911 advice needed

Well, um, this sounds like a toe problem, likely in the front.  Unless 
the shop put your car on the chassis bench, there's no quantitative way 
to tell if the frame is damaged.  Your description of the damage sounds 
significant, leading me to believe that they should've checked the chassis!

Any shop worth it's wait in salt would've put your car on the rack 
after replacing the front suspension, wheels, and tyres.  Brakes have 
nothing to do with pulling to the left unless a piston is partially 
seized.  In that case, they should've rebuilt the caliper.  Excessive 
rotor & pad wear on one side only would be a dead give-away in this case.

Additional possible causes: damaged front suspension points, linkages 
(i.e., bad parts not replaced after crash), rear alignment (toe), or 
excessive differential camber, i.e., one tyre tilted in/out much more 
than the other one on the same axle, causing "camber thrust", or a 
pulling to one side.  Camber thrust might indeed worsen under braking 
due to camber increase, if it were at the front axle.

I'd recommend that (another) shop check:
1) wheel alignment
2) chassic alignment

... and proceed from there.  Good luck,

Subject: 944S Clutch, etc - Where To Buy

Greets,

 Recently I received a lightweight flywheel as a gift and figure that it
would be a good time to replace the clutch, pressure plate, and t/o
bearing as well.

 Does anyone have suggestions in terms of where to get a clutch set for an
'87 944S?  I've heard of the many revision caveats to watch out for in
other parts like water pumps and timing belts but what about clutch parts?

 Thanks in advance for any advice.

Greetings,
	I'm using my '89 951 mainly for PCA Club Racing and drivers ed 
track stuff. As a heavy car with a fair amount of power, the brakes take a 
beating. This car on the front has calipers made by the Italian company 
Brembo specifically for Porsche. I think initially they were made for the 
928S4 , then put on the Turbo Cup 944s and then on the '88 
944TurboS.	
	To clean up and rebuild these calipers I innocently took the 
caliper halves apart. It definitely made the job much easier. Subsequently 
I got hold of the factory workshop manual for the 951 which says in bold 
text that one should NOT take these calipers apart. They are held together 
with 4 socket head cap screws, which on assembly are torqued PAST their 
yield point. The manual says that "special equipment", unavailable to 
common man, is needed to duplicate this.
	I can't see throwing away these very expensive calipers because of 
4 bolts. The Brembo US office can't (won't) help me. There's got to be some 

commercially available hi-strength bolts that, properly torqued, would do 
just fine.

Steve,

	Any auto parts store stocks adhesive kits for regluing rearview
mirrors to the windshield.  I think they run less than $5.  By the way,
the piece that attaches to the glass is separate from the rest of the
mirror.  You glue this on (following directions supplied with the kit),
then slip the rest of the mirror assembly into the slot on the bracket.

	One problem, you will need a heated garage to do this job in the
Chicago area at this time of year.

I had the same problem with my 912 many years ago. the problem is the
mainshaft pilot bearing in the flywheel gland nut. Best to just replace it
while you are in there putting in the new clutch. While you are at it
check the mainshaft axial runout to see if it is bent. Mine was, which can
also cause the noise. Good luck.

Subject: weak brakes



Apostolos,

My guess is that you still have air in the system
somewhere.

Here's a simple check of the master cylinder, though:

  Press your foot down several times on the brake
  pedal with the car running, then press it down 
  and hold it firmly. If the seals are good, the 
  pedal will hold. If the seals are worn or the 
  bore pitted, the brake pedal will slowly sink
  to a lower level.

  Also if the master cylinder needs repair, there
  may be brake fluid leaking past all the seals 
  and into the dust boot.

Several people have mentioned power bleeders here.
That may be what you need to chase all the air out
of your system. Also check the thickness of your
disks. They may be beyond the wear limits, which 
would make the brakes feel weaker due to extra 
pedal travel and overheating.

Good luck.

I just spent an hour at the dealer drooling.  This is a VERY limited edition
(18 produced) model which looks like the normal 930 3.6 with a few exceptions:

 - front fender a slant similar to the 993 with 928 pop-up headlights.

 - Front lower valance sports IMSA style "whiskers" at each corner and has
	brake ducts instead of the normal drving lighhts (ala imsa)

 - Each rear fender has a 959 style duct (kinda D shaped) feeding
	the rear brake and engine area.  The left one is big enough for 
	a hand, the right only for a few fingers.

 - The rear spoiler/deck lid is a one-peicecomposite (maybe fiberglass)
	affair with molded and smoothed in lip.

 - The rear features quad chrome exhaust.

Specs on the car were listed in the windows as 380HP, however according
to "sources" the actual output is closer to 425.  Apparently the EPA
requires recertification if HP exceeds certified figures by some
specified amount.  The 3.6 normal is rated at 360.



I'll be having the photos by 3:30 EST and plan on scanning them to

Steve-

Auto parts stores sell a re-adhesion kit for the stick-on rear view
mirrors.  The kit contains some superglue-type stuff and some cleaner.
It is more expensive than it's components but it's convenient.

The most important part of the installation is the pre-cleaning of
your mount spot.  Use a razor to scrape away the old adhesive, and
then use a good strong cleaner like acetone or the stuff in the kit.
Also clean the mirror mount block.  The cleaner you get them, the
longer the new mount will last.

There might also be some benefit in heating the windshield with a hair
dryer to get it up in the 70 F range.

Steve,

In my opinion, trying to do this job without the tool (or using a
dealer who "does it by feel") is very ill-advised.  I would recommend
either borrowing the tool (if you belong to a PCA region, perhaps one
of other members has one), buying the tool or paying someone who has
the tool to do the job correctly.  The likely consequences of
incorrect tension are bent valves, no matter whether the belt breaks,
jumps teeth or shears off enough teeth to screw up the timing.

Although the tensioning tool is expensive, so is paying someone else
who has it (the "tools are free" concept someone recently stated).
Somehow, you have to make the strategic decision as to whether or not
you intend to do your own work on the car, not only this job but those
that are sure to arise in the future.  If so, then buy the tool.
Since you will need to remove the crank pulley to get the back of the
belt cover off, a flywheel lock is very useful, as well as an
appropriate socket and breaker bar to deal with the pulley bolt.
There is another special tool for holding the balance shaft pulleys
while the tightening their bolts.  This is not essential, but is
definitely handy.

>Dealer quoted 10 hours labor barring broken studs.  For someone doing this 
>for the first time, is this realistic?
If you are asking whether it would take you 10 hours to do this your
first time, the answer is probably yes.  There are lots of parts that
have to come off.

Hope this helps,
Milo

Subject: '70 911T ?'s

I recently purchased my first Porsche a '70 911T and have some questions.
Hopefully some of you can provide answers.

1) One of the wipers was not tracking with the other. I removed the wiper
arm to discover that the shaft that drives it has splines and the inside
of the wiper arm does not. I cleaned up the splines and torqued down the
wiper arm pretty good and it works OK for now, but I concerned that 
continued use this way will ruin the splines on the shaft. Should the
inside of the wiper arm have mating splines, or is a smooth surface
normal?

2) This car has a pretty good exhaust bark. Further inspection revealed
some good size rusted holes in the mufflers. I didn't spend big bucks to
buy the car, and while I intend to properly maintain it, I don't want to
spend big bucks on upgrades. Can anyone recommend a good source for a
used exhaust pipe/muffler assembly? Or a new after market assembly that
is reasonably priced?

3) The car is missing the reset knob for the trip ODO. Any tips on where
to get one and how to install it?

4) I have some small rust holes in the forward sections of the floor
pan. Anybody have a suggestion on how to seal these up, short of cutting
out and welding in new floor pans?

Thanks in advance for your help,

Just a recommendation for those of us with failed heater blowers on
later 911 SCs:

We have rigid metal fuel injection lines, which make extracting and
installing new heater blowers difficult.  When I was installing a
new one in my '83 SC, I did a lot of swearing until I disassembled 
the electric motor from the black fan housing. In two pieces, it was
much easier to slip past all the plumbing, then you can easily
re-assemble it.  I think four or five screws hold it together.

BTW, the heater blower came from Tweaks, and it cost too much.

I've done it - can't really say much about how the car feels - it's 
soft before, it's soft after...  You get a lot more camber, and it 
looks better (instead of like an off-road car).

> Procedures, hints, affects on alignment, is it a shop thing?
You need a special tool for a slot in the trailing arms, and the bolt 
torque is pretty high.  You also must insure the left/right heights 
match.  You'll need an alignment afterwards, and if you're picky, a 
weight/corner balancing job too.

YES!  Your dealer should be SHOT for doing it by feel!  An incorrectly 
tensioned belt can jump a tooth or break, or overload a pulley, making 
it seize.  The result is $$$$ on the head repair!

Hello P-philes.

Has anyone else seen the slam on the 911 Turbo 3.6 expressed in the
January issue of "Popular Science"?  They ran it against the Corvette
ZR-1, the Dodge Viper, and the Toyota Supra Turbo.  Not ever having
driven any of these vehicles, I am interested in some more informed
opinions about this kind of comparison.  (One thing not in question is
the high cost of the 911.)

Replace the rubber brake hoses.  After a number of years, these get

PCA Zone 7 is hosting a two day Autocross school for beginner

for novices not to show up with race rubber on their car.

The two day event promises lots of track time and I don't
really want to put my low mileage Dunlop SP8000 tires
through this. Am I being paranoid or will an AX school
lasting two days not put too much wear and tear on my
tire?

Why would they not want us to use real AX tires?

By the way, what is the current thought on who makes
the best AX tire? Goodyear? Yoko? Goodrich?

Steven,

I got my copy yesterday and only looked at half of the film
before my eyes got too heavy.

It could be that I was too tired, but I was not that impressed
with the film. A lot of interviews with Porsche designers and
technicians mixed with glimpses from the 30 year long history.

My friend Martin, on the other hand, liked the film and if you're

 I haven't followed this discussion,but my old and sold BMW 320 once
complained about the heater blower motor. I dissassembled the blower
and found the carbons to be 'way gone'.Ok I thaught,I'll pop down to
the local dealer and get some new carbons.No such thing but they were
eager to sell me a new motor,it was really cheap,only about $230.
I felt thse two carbons couldn't be worth that kind of money.

I took my blower motor to an 'Auto-electric' repairsman.He had a shelf
full of carbons,after some searching he found a set of carbons for a
Mitsubishi alternator.They were perfect match. I carefully removed the
old ones,slipped the new ones in and soldered the 'cable' that is
attached to them to the appropriate place.All in all this cost me
about $5.

Auto electric repairsmen or women for that matter,have carbons in all
ranges,if it it the carbons that sucks,be a handyman('gal) and do it
yourself!!

hope this wasn't to 'way out',...........but if you are talking about
burnt anchors,seized bearing etc. that's another story.

      Doug,
	You can lower the rear about 3/4" with the eccentric adjustment on 
the spring plate. If you have the right size wrenches this is an easy job 
that can be done in your garage with the car on jack stands. I would 
recommend a 4 wheel alignment after doing this.
	 To lower the car further in the rear the torsion bars must be 
reindexed, which is a BIG job.  The whole torque tube must be dropped.  To 
me this is not one of Porsche's more brilliant designs. I considered doing 
it myself on my 951, but in the end had a shop do it. When I saw what was 
involved, I'm glad I didn't try it myself. I strongly suggest having it 
done by someone who's done it before so you don't pay for his "learning 
curve."
	Don't lower the rear too much. This would put the CV joints at an 
angle that could lead to premature wear. My car ended up with the vertical 
distance from the floor through the center of the wheel to the lip of the 
fender opening at 24.5".  Make sure that the spring plate adjustment ends 
up in the middle of its range with the car level after the torsion bar 
indexing. This will allow fine tuning for weight balancing the car should 
you ever decide to do that.  You'll definitely need an alignment after 
indexing the torsion bars.

Hope this helps.

Porschephiles,

I just got my Certificate of Authenticity from 
Porsche Cars North America, after approx. 2 month
wait. I thought I'd let those of you who are 
interested know what it's all about. This is what
they send:

A nice silver folio with a letter describing Porsche's
Classic Parts Program 

a vellum cover sheet with Porsche's "mission 
statement" (We all have a desire to create something 
that will show we are here (...) Cars which will be 
respected not only in their own day, but indefinitely, 
because they appeal to a basic appreciation for 
logical thought, precision and creativity" 
 - Prof. Dr.-Ing. h.f.c. Porsche

The handsome looking certificate, with model year/type
engine number, transmission number, exterior paint
code, interior material/color/type, and optional 
equipment.
(my only surprize was that my transmission # is two
later in sequence than the number given - the numbers
are a little beat-up so I'll have to double check)

The certificate did not include date of manufacture
or where the car was shipped. I was kind of curious
about that because I'd like to track down the first 
owner if possible some day. All I know is that the 
second owner purchased the car in Seattle when it was
a year old (supposedly with 50+ K miles) - must have
been an interesting first year!

I'll post the Certificate of Authenticity information
to the FAQ list next week in case others are 
interested.

Subject: Roto-hoist

Hi, Trond.
 
My friend's '58 coupe is on a roto-hoist, or rotisserie, that we made
ourselves. We just used a big MIG welder on some 6 mm wall tubing, both
square and round. The only critical dimension is the height of the axis (so
your roof will not strike the floor). If we were to do ti again, we would
make the brackets that go to the bumper mounts a little different, giving
easier mounting or make them self-aligning.
 
I think the best thing is if I send you a few Polaroids that show the basic
idea, with the critical dimension, and you can design your own.
 
I also have a different kind of arrangement for putting cars on their roofs
(or sides, or whatever.) It's an 8-sided cage. The front goes to the sway
bar bracket mounts, the rear goes to the two bolts that hold the
engine-transmission "U" bracket. With the car in this, you can get a friend
to help (THUMP) turn it (THUMP) over on (THUMP) its (THUMP) roof. When
standing normally, four big wheels let you move it around. The advantage to
this thing over a rotisserie is that it allows you to work with the bumpers
still attached, and it takes up less space ahead and behind the car. It's
more difficult to make (precise jigging is required) so I paid somebody to
make it for me. He has made several for Gary Emory and others.

Subject: '70 911T ?'s

Hi, Mike.
 
Regarding your rust holes, depending on how bad it is and where it is, you
might be able to do a good repair without replacing the pan. I just did a
similar job on my daily driver 356. It had some rust perforation right in
the middle of each front foot area (between the seats and front
footrests/pedal areas), but all the metal around there was solid. I didn't
want to do a complete floor because 1) they're never right afterwards;
original is best if you can still keep it and 2) the connections between the
new floor and the sides and back and front are important and not easy to
weld.
 
My solution was to very carefully cut a large rectangular hole in the floor
(13 x 18") and cut an exact matching piece out of a new replacement floor.
The fit has to be very tight, not more than 1/16 gap at worst, even better
is a flush fit. I clamped the patch in place, made sure it was even with the
old metal in every location as I went along, and made LOTS of tiny tack
welds (every inch or so) to hold it in position. Then I went over the entire
patch in small segments, drawing a weld bead maybe an inch or two long,
quenching with a wet rag, then going to another area far away to spread the
heat out.
 
Finished, with the welds ground flat, you can't tell there is a patch in
there.
 
It takes a while to learn to weld. If you have no welding experience, you
might have to find a shop that will do it this way. Of course, if you're not
too worried about appearance but just want a good solid floor, you can put
in a patch with about an inch overlap. That's an easy one to do. You have to
evaluate how bad the rust is now, does it go to the edges of the pan or
weaken any important structural parts, or is it just a hole in the middle of
an expanse of mostly flat metal?

Subject: 1994 911 Turbo S

Hi, Steve.
 
They made more than 18, but it's still a pretty rare bird. I can quote from
the official factory press release, issued for the Detroit and LA shows at
the beginning of the year:
 
"The 911 Turbo S is available with two distinctive bodywork options: rear
fender vents and rear spoiler only, or slantnose and front spoiler with rear
fender vents and rear spoiler.
 
"Engine for the 911 Turbo S is inspired by the 1993 IMSA Bridgestone
Supercar championship-winning Brumos Porsche 911 Turbo 3.6. This 3.6 liter,
six-cylinder, air-cooled power plant features the enhanced camshafts and
turbocharger of the Porsche Supercar motor. In addition, a special four-pipe
exhaust system has been created especially for the model. These
modifications raise the horsepower output of the engine from 355 of the
standard 911 Turbo 3.6 to 380, thus designating the new 911 Turbo S as the
most powerful production Porsche ever offered for sale in the United States.
All 1994 911 Turbo S cars sold in the U.S. are equipped with these enhanced
performance options.
 
"A worldwide total of approximately 100... are planned, with the majority
coming to the U.S. market. As there will be no 1995 model offered in the
U.S., these vehicles represent the last 911 Turbos constructed on the 964
project platform for the U.S. market.
 
"Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price for the new 911 Turbo S with rear
fender vents and rear spoiler is $119,921. The MSRP for the Turbo S with
slantnose and front spoiler, rear fender vents and rear spoiler is $159,179.
These prices do not reflect other available Porsche options such as special
seats, interiors and exterior paint.
 
 
I had the opportunity to put my test gear on Hans Stuck's Brumos Turbo after
the last race of 1992, at Del Mar. The day after he won the series for
Porsche in this car, I met the Brumos transporter at the Pomona drag strip.
Mr. Bailie of Brumos pushed the car out, gave me the keys, and basically
said "have fun" while he unhitched the cab, left the trailer standing, and
went off for a few hours to run errands. I "had fun" until the tank went
dry and I didn't know what gas they used (I assumed it wasn't pump gas).
Anyway, that car did the quarter mile in 12.61 at 119.3 mph has more than
the 380 or so hp they claimed for the racer, even then. I got 120 mph on one
run. When you consider that they have a big turbo and bigger tires on it,
so it doesn't get off the mark as quickly as the regular Turbo, yet is
moving 10 mph faster at the quarter (with 200 odd pounds of lead plates
bolted in the nose, even) you have to figure it's got close to 500 hp. My
report appeared in the January 1993 Sports Car International.

few "non-standard" places I'll be for the next couple of months...

2/9 - Northern New Jersey Region monthly meeting, The Skylands at Randolph
      (792 Route 10 West, Randolph Township)

      Since I just officially re-aligned my region affiliation, figured
      I'd go see if a region 4x larger than Lone Star had 4x the turnout
      at an event... If you're in the area, and not a PCA member, gimme
      a shout and I'll get you directions and a join-the-PCA kit.

2/19-20 - driving events, Lone Star Region. TWS driving school the 19th,
      autox the 20th. I'll be there for at least one, maybe both, depending
      on which cars are running, how *I'm* doing on my Spousal Maintenence
      Level, and other factors.

3/5 - Zone One Tech Tactics, Springfield, MA. I figure to show up in the
      afternoon, stick around overnight, leave the following AM. A
      Porschephiles gathering is definitely called for...

3/21-27 - UNIFORUM, San Francisco, CA. Look for me in the NetSmiths booth
      if you're on the show floor. If you'd like a get-in-free pass, send
      me e-mail and I'll send you some (I have far more than I need given
      current number of customers -- let's say limit of 50 per request...)
      We're gonna have some cool giveaways too...

      My wife will probably be out for the week too. Pam Collopy has offered
      to coordinate a get-together one evening, so work with her on that.
      Her address is collopy@leland.stanford.edu.
  
That's it for now...

Subject: 924 brakes, O2 sensor

   
   For O2 sensor and rough idle issues; my brothers '83 SC was running 
     very poorly when cold; bad startup and rough running when cold.
     After replacing the oxygen sensor and the normal handwaving, he broke
     down and went to the (gasp) dealer. Apparently there is a relay in 
     the passenger compartment that works with the oxygen sensor...I don't
     know anything more than that, but replacement of the relay and CO 
     adjustment means his car is running right....and it only cost $130    
     for all.  

   For Apostelos' spongy 924 brakes; You probably WON'T see any external
     leakage for a bad master cylinder, the seal thats given out is the
     piston seal inside the master cylinder. If you can pump up the brakes,
     then feel the pedal sink to the floor if you keep standing on it,
     your master cylinder is bad. If you can't pump up the brakes after
     bleeding and there are no bad lines, its a master cylinder. Its not
     just that shops routinely call any brake problem a "master cylinder" 
     problem 'cause its money in the pocket, they really do wear out.         
   I'd also suggest replacing all rubber brake lines while the system
     is getting flushed. The imitation-rubber Porsche makes will be bad 
     within a couple years...or as soon as you get fast and have to stop.
     Don't waste your money on braided steel junk...

Subject: 24 Hours of Daytona

        As I work directly across the street from the Daytona international
Speedway, I sent a couple of hours yesterday afternoon watching the
practice and the first round of GTS and GTU qualifying.  Of the 45 cars
that logged times yesterday, 20 were 911s, there were two 968s, and two
944s.  The Brumos 911 was fastest Porsche at 6th @ 114.16 MPH.  The
Gentillozzi et al. Nissan 300Z had the 3rd highest speed @ 118.26 MPH.  I
only noted two Vettes, with one taking 8th with 111.51 MPH.  Qualifying
continues today, but alas, work will require my presence today.  
        It was interesting to me that most of the GTS & GTU cars had bodies
that were so modified that the only way you tell what they were was by the
advertising on the sides.  The Porsches, however, were all visually
obvious.

  The tops are made of fiberGlass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) according to
the body manual.  I dont think they were painted with anything, just left
as natural.  I've seen these painted with gloss black paint that adhered
to the texture -not hardly oem in appearance.
  Problem with these is the pigment in the plastic fades with exposure
to UV and washings.  Rejuvinating it would be a crapshoot.
  If the top's finish is real bad, it can be refinished similar to 
fiberglass.  Sand smooth and re-paint with your own texture/color.

  Anybody else have info on this?

Subject: 2nd car survey results

Hi gang,

A while back Paul and I posed the question of "what car to buy".  To recap,
the requirements were along the lines of tall driver, automatic transmission,
room in the back seat; the good ol' family car under $20k that could be
considered for lease.  We have not been impressed with Toyota quality or
service (4 cars worth in the family), I don't fit in a Honda, and the LH
series have a rather larger blind spot at the right front.

The response was heavily in favor of the Ford Taurus or SHO, although there 
were many other cars that were well rated by the owners.  I will attempt to
list all the cars.  Some were recommendations, others actually owned/driven.

Audi  
  80                                 not available
  Quattro, unspecified model         90/100/S4 range from $26k upwards

BMW
 5 series, 528e                      $41k upwards

Buick
 Park Avenue                         $26k upwards, insurance index of 1,
                                     first for safety, runner-up in class
                                     (Kiplinger)

Chrysler
  Concorde                           perhaps worth another look at this series
  Contour & Cirrus                   (not yet available)

Eagle
 Vision                              the third in the LH series, rated best
                                     in class 

Ford 
 Taurus                              have yet to see a Ford last more than a
 Taurus SHO                          few years because of rust; with a lease
                                     it wouldn't matter.  Insurance rating only
                                     a 2.

Hyundai
  Sonata GLS V6                      worth a look; no airbag, insurance rating
                                     at 13

Jaguar XJ-6                          new starting at $62k.  (new XJ12 looks
                                     nice....)

  626 LS                             all 626 line worth a look
  929                                prices start at $31k

Mercedes

 300D                                start at $51k

Nissan

  Altima                             worth a look
  Sentra SE-R                        worth a look

 244 series                          240 model dropped for '94
                                     in general, we like the Volvos, but to 
                                     get one large enough now is about $30k
             
VW
 Golf                                too small
 Jetta                               worth a look, although the Passat has
 Passat                              more rear leg room (and you have to 
                                     pay to get it; about $23k).


bottom line: We are still undecided.  We were considering the Mitsubishi
Galant and were surprised that no one mentioned it.  Many of the '94 models 
were not available on the lots when I was out looking.  Also, the car will not
be purchased or used in California, so negotiating prices now seems foolish.
Also, depending on the condition of the 944 we may find ourselves in a 
situation of buying/leasing two cars.  In that case, the whole scenario
shifts.  Some of you wondered why an automatic and other 'creature comforts'.
I have been advised by doctors (and backed up by common sense) to ease up
on the left leg usage.  I had surgery on that knee twice in '87 (nothing 
serious) and I still do not have full use of that leg.  Things are further
complicated with the onset of rheumatoid-like symptoms.  

So, I thought you all might like to see what the other pfile members are
driving and are thinking about purchasing.  I hope I included everyone's
input...

Thanks again for the net-wisdom,
Pam

There are three adhesive processes I've seen for Porsche PU components,
like the front air dam on a 944.  The first is available from Porsche,
and I have the part number(s) on file.  The second was one recommended
by John Paterek.

The third is a process I believe called CMC which my body shop uses.  It
is apparently OE on Corvettes, and they (the body shop) have been very
pleased with it.  (No, they don't do Corvettes, just high-end Euro cars.)

Yeah, there was a similar comparison where they had someone that
actually knew how to drive (Danny Sullivan) driving a similar set
of cars on track, and he came to the opposite conclusion, i.e. the
911 Turbo is by a good margin the best, most fun to drive, fastest,
best lap times, and also the hardest to drive well. "Popular Myth
and Science" is NOT the kind of magazine that I expect to see a good
review of automotive excellence.

>You'll definitely need an alignment after indexing the torsion bars.

You may also find that you cannot get a reasonable rear camber after
lowering the car that much.  Try the simple adjustment at the rear
spring plates first.  If that isn't "enough", and you do lower the rear
some more, you obviously have to compensate at the front.  Which means
shorter and stiffer springs, among other things...

Not sure, but if you lower the rear much, I would have to think that you
will also have to increase the spring rate there too, to avoid bottoming
out the suspension.  Feh.

Well, now you've gone and done it, Lance!  That's right, you must *not* 
separate the halves!  At least you know that know, for the "next time".

Unless anyone knows better, I infer from the manuals (which could be a 
bad thing to do) that it's the *bolts* that are tightened to their 
yielding point, leaving the caliper halves reusable.  If you can get 
your hands on replacement bolts (prob. very special), and can somehow, 
magically, torque them to their yeilding point, you'll be OK.

The trick is determining the yielding point.  I'd guess that the torque 
goes up and up, until finally starting to flatten out; this is where 
you're at the limit of material strength.  Continuing to tighten would 
see the torque drop rapidly, followed by total failure of the bolt 
(shear, snap, thread strip...).  Without special equipment, I don't 
think you can determine this point.

Safest bet: send the parts back to Brembo and request that they put it 
back together.  Charge: $millions.  Time: months.

Your tires will be fine for the school.  You'll actually being doing 
very little to them.  If you were attending a track (high speed, long

Ask an organizer/instructor why they don't want race rubber.  Out our

Subject: 914 Injection, Rust

Hello everyone, 

	Since the weather was relatively warm (and DRY) today here in 
Boulder, I decided to take the 914 out for a spin today. I made two 
rather disconcerting discoveries:

		1) My battery-induced rust has finally gotten to the 
		point where metal? needs to be replaced (the passenger 
		door glass binds on the rear of the window frame)

		2) My idle has gone awry. It starts fine and idles well 
		for the first few minutes of operation and then the 
		tell-tale sign of a vacuum leak rears its ugly head with 
		the high-low idle. But since it doesn't happen all the 
		time, I'm not sure that it is as simple as a vacuum leak.

So I have two (three, really) questions for the great net-oracle:

		1) What are sources of high quality sheetmetal for the 914?
			(preferably relatively inexpensive also)		
		2) Does anyone have recommendations for a Porsche body shop in 
		   the Denver/Boulder area? 
		3) Any ideas on the wacky idle?

Thanks for reading this wordy mess
Thanks in advance for the advice.

There's definitely a coating on the roof -- don't know what it is or how to
reapply it, though.  My roof's coating had started to peel off, so the
previous owner put on *vinyl* on top of it.  Yecch.

When I had my bodywork done, I had them sand the roof and paint it body

YES!  Your dealer should be SHOT for doing it by feel!  An incorrectly 
tensioned belt can jump a tooth or break, or overload a pulley, making 
it seize.  The result is $$$$ on the head repair!


I have a true confession to make. When I worked for Porsche, one of my
projects was endurance testing of an engine we designed for SEAT. It was
basically a conventional inline-4 with an overhead cam driven by a belt. We
had the official Porsche tensioning tool available, but all my mechanics
hated it and just did it by feel. There is a difference of opinion between
the guys in the field and the service training school, I guess. The tool is
pretty wonky anyway, if it's the one I think -- sort of a rectangular lump
of steel, with I think a dial indicator on it?
 
The mechanics must have had good feel. We never had a belt fail because of
wrong tension. We did have an engine fail because of wrong mechanic. My
favorite mechanic had just finished replacing a head gasket, and was about
to torque the head down, when his shift was ended. The next guy came in, and
he knew everything. I offered to continue helping to put the head back, he
said he would rather do it alone, he's been doing this longer than I have
been aware of cars, etc. OK, I said, just set the timing to 15 BTDC, warm it
up, and go right back to the full-load program. We were only a few hours
from the end of the 600 hour test. About the time I got to my desk, the
phone rang. "The other mechanic must have f----ed up the engine, it sounds
like a diesel." I went back to the dyno. Sure enough, it sounded like a
diesel. I figured there was air in the lifters, revved it by hand, no
change. "What exactly did you do?" "Well, you said to set timing to 15 BTDC.
I couldn't turn the distributor far enough for that, so I just moved the
timing belt over by two teeth." Uh, you did what? "Moved the belt by 2
teeth." Why did you do that? "You know how it is -- once the head is off the
engine, those marks they put on the timing gears don't mean anything." OK,
thank you very much, you can go home now, this engine comes apart tomorrow.

By now you've probably guessed what the piston tops looked like. 
I still have the S-shaped valves on my bookshelf. It turns out that the
mechanical genius was looking at the wrong pointer for TDC on the pulley,
that's why he couldn't get the distributor turned far enough. After that we
painted the rib that served as the pointer with dayglo paint, just for him.

From: race911@aol.com
Subject: 911 engine/driveline

A couple of comments on subjects over the last week, and something about
clutches (several private questions).

1.  "improving" engine characteristics via electronic bolt-on

Some discussion was made about replace the Motronic air flow meter with the
aftermarket mass flow sensor.  I go along with the "plug in the pipeline"
theory.  If the stock setup is so restrictive, how does Todd Knighton
(Protomotive) get 330 hp out of his basic 3.2 turbo kit with stock injection?
 (Call him, not me if you want specifics.)

The manufacturer of this component is basically saying that this bolt- on
will make your 3.2 engine a 3.6 power-wise, no other mods necessary.  Realize
also that with the one unit I have seen in person (not being CA legal, I have
little customer interest in them), the casting of the housing was not OE
quality and the K&N "cone" air filter looked out of place. (I will suggest
that slight intake improvent may come from simply replacing your stock air
filter element with the replacement K&N.)

As far as the comment  by the person who stated such a car was markedly
quicker at the track...well, for the amount this thing sells for (note I
didn't say costs them to make) you can grab your spouse and head for a nice
vacation w/ Mssrs. Bondurant, Barber, or Russell and LEARN how to drive the
car!  If you're that good already (and who among us are), hey, go to another
4 or 5 track events this year.  Better yet, take the kids to Disneyland or
something.

2.  locking differentials

Anyone else want a factory LSD?  Got a guy who'll sell his for a pretty
reasonable price.  He wanted to labor trade me when I put the Quaife in his
car.  Oh yeah, it just needs to be rebuilt...again.  In all fairness, I do
know of some guys in Australia running 930 racers who have broken 2 Quaifes,
so they've gone back to factory LSD.

3. 911 clutch adjustment  ('77-'86)/ 930 (-88)

Proper adjustment is the single biggest problem re: clutch failure in these
model years.  This will cause premature disc wearout, heavy pedal feel, and
even internal transmission damage.  I have done two transmissions in January
directly the result of  bad clutches...and only because they weren't adjusted
properly at some point.  Note these were new customers; these guys didn't
know they had a problem looming until BOOM, no first gear one day.

The factory changed the operation of the clutch release in '77 to include a
horseshoe shaped "helper" spring at the bellhousing.  This necessitated the
use of a two piece clutch arm which must have a slight freeplay between the
pieces.  Basically you want an inch of  cable travel at the transmission end
of the cable and 1mm of freeplay between the two pieces of the clutch arm.
(Haynes manual has photo, look in supplement at back.) 

Inexperienced or unknowledgable mechanics have a habit of just tightening
down the bolt until a proper "feel" at the clutch pedal is acheived.  This is
incorrect as it puts a preload on the release bearing (and the pressure
plate).  It's just like having your foot slightly riding the clutch.  The
problem is that once the pressure plate is subjected to this, the poor thing
takes a set, thus the "heavy" feel during clutch operation.  Sorry, but you
can't go back and properly adjust the thing after it's done this. 
Replacement is the only solution.

Many times this happens because the clutch gets "out of adjustment."  It
really isn't and here's what happens:  at the pedal box end there's a bushing
in the eyelet holding the cable to the pedal box.  It's plastic and it wears,
then it breaks!  Then you suddenly have an extra 3-4 mm of freeplay and it
gets harder to shift! Eventually you can wear the eyelet clean through.  It's
just that with the introduction of power boosters on the brakes, no one does
the pedal bushings anymore like you used to have to do when a master cylinder
would take a dump and screw up the pedal bushings. Automotion sells a bronze
bushing which is sturdier.

And, undue expense can be incurred if this is a multi-day event. While it's
not in the same catagorey, exactly, I went through *two sets* (yeah, 8
tires at $115 each) of A008RS in a two day SCCA licensing school here
a while back... If you were to substitute "autox" for "road race", and
"A008RS II" for "A008RS", you'd probably get the same results...

Of course, you'll have less fun if you run say Sear's Road Handlers, you
could get in a lot more miles before you needed to swap tires...

Bottom line: show up with whatever you have on the car, for both school
and real events, until you've established that (a) you *LIKE* this enough 
spend serious money on, and (b) you're good enough for it to matter...

I *THINK* it's something like Body Schutz shot with a stipple gun. Then
over-sprayed with a flat black, similar to that used on late Targa
bars. But I don't do the concours resto stuff on 914s, so I've never
really had to know that... Maybe wading back through some post-Parade
Panos would give you winners in the 914 division that could be contacted.
Someone has *got* to know this stuff...

When I've needed this on a street car, I've just found a better top and
swapped. My race has two big holes drilled in it's top to allow it to be
bolted to the targa bar. The EP 914 and the 914/6s with GT flares we're
recently done all got the top-sanded-smooth treatment.

Ouch. This means that you're in for a *big* expense to get it fixed
right. So I'm gonna ask the hard question: do you love your car enough
to fix it right, or are you gonna cheap out and try to band-aid it?
There are very, very few things on a 914 that you *MUST* fix correctly
if you're going to bother at all, and this class of rust is right
at the top of the list.

You asked the wrong questions in the wrong order. Your car has the
car equivalent of terminal cancer. You want the best doctor you can
find. You don't want to then come in and say "well, I found this other
drug at K-mart, maybe it will work..."

Back to the basics of How Shops Work. They make money on two things:
charging more per hour than they're paying staff per hour, and margin
on parts they sell you. If you won't let them sell you parts, they
won't be happy about working on your car. If they're not happy, they'll
cut corners to do the work in less time than they're charging you for
which will ultimately work to your detriment. (i.e. it won't be fixed
RIGHT).

You should, however, let them know that you know about places like Mill 
Supply and the various Porsche aftermarket suppliers so that they
don't try to stick you with dealer prices on stuff. You should also
let them know that using used sheet metal "clips" is OK, if in fact
it is. (Brace yourself -- you are *probably* looking at what's called a
"Rear Suspension Console" as part of this. The *new* Porsche price for
just the sheet metal is over $900; the new sheet metal price in the
aftermarket is $400-500; a good clip is $250 or so; and a genius metal
fabricator/body man can fix the whole thing from flat sheet metal including
all labor for $200 - if you can find one [call me if you need one and
are willing to send your car to Houston])

Oh, and your interior *should* come out, as the firewall is almost certainly
rusted through. ANd your engine/transmission *MUST* come out, at it is
in the way and could be seriously damaged in the welding... Like I said,
this is a *BIG* job. You almost certainly can't do it at home.

Good luck.

WARNING

Before you get started on this, you need to know something up front: this
is a *VERY* high volume list, about 1.5 megabytes a month, usually 30-50
Kbytes a day.  Getting the digest will make it easier to deal with the
volume if that's a problem for you.

This is also a very successful list, having been around for over 5 years, and 
unlike most Internet mailing lists or USENET newsgroups, is made up of people 
mainly between their late 20s and mid-40s. We all have busy lives, and 
that's why there are RULES here.

I'm not just sending you this message for grins, YOU HAD BETTER READ IT.
There will be a test -- your conduct here -- and a grade -- whether you 
get to stay on the list or not!

HOW IT WORKS

It's really quite simple. If you send a messages to  the address

    porschephiles@tta.com

it gets reflected out to over 600 people, as soon as it comes in. Messages
are also saved and sent out in one daily batch as Porschephiles-Digest
for members who prefer to only get a single message a day.

Also, once a month you'll get a Montly Update mailing which has some useful 
information, and the Who's Who list. To get listed on Who's Who, send me your 
name, the state you live in, kind of car (sorry, I only list Porsches), and 
your email address. These two notes are also available via FTP along with 
archives of past digests. (see the FTP ACCESS section for details)

MAIL ERRORS

This list goes (as of today) to 607 people on 453 different computer
systems. Odds are very, very good that when you send something to the list
that it *WILL* fail to reach at least one member, generating some sort
of "failed mail" message back to you. Don't be alarmed, just ignore it.
Dont' re-send it, don't tell me about it, just ignore it.
Unless the message is from "MAILER-DAEMON@tta.com", it went out just fine,
and you're only experiencing "normal" mail failures...

GETTING THE DIGEST/CHANGES-OF-ADDRESS/DROPPING OFF THE LIST

If you want to get the digest version, need to change your address, need
to tell someone about broken service, wish to request to be dropped from 
the list, or just have comments, complaints, and other administrative 
issues to the address:

    porschephiles-request@tta.com

This list is operated *MANUALLY* -- all requests are handled by hand, by
me; there is no "listserv" functionality. 

PLEASE do not burden the whole list with any of the above, and if you give 
out info about the list, refer to the "-request" address ONLY.  Use the 
"@tta.com" addresses listed above, instead of any other porschephiles
addresses you might have heard about in the past. They are defunct.

Now the bad part: I run a couple of companies and a racing team. I don't
have a lot of time  to spend on this -- it's not like I'm a grad student or
"just a programmer" somewhere. I already *HAVE* a life...

So, what does this mean for you?

1) adds, drops, and changes will take at least a one day turn-around.
   No more than a three day turn around, but *AT LEAST* one day.
   If you don't like the list or need to drop off of it, SENDING MORE
   THAN ONE REQUEST ONLY PISSES ME OFF AND DOESN"T GET YOU OFF ANY FASTER.

2) while I'm still available to help anyone with anything, it may take 
   me a day or so to get back to you

3) I'll leave most of the commentary and tech  help  to others. If I
   can just  dash off a note on something quickly, I will but if it needs
   my off-line library for help, and I'm not in Houston, nope, not this week...

RULES FOR USE

Please read the rest of this message. There *WILL* be a test...

First, this is NOT a USENET newsgroup. It is not even *similar* to a USENET
newsgroup. For starters, it was designed to cater to people who actually
own or know something about Porsche cars. People very busy trying to make
money to support their German metal habit. One of the implict assumptions
in that is that you *must* be doing something right, or you'd be drving a
Yugo. Hence, you are expected to act in a responsible and professional manner.

Second, neither I nor the rest of the list have time to spend on people doing 
stupid things, so if you start doing stupid things, you may be dropped from
the list. These may include doing any of the following things:

* persistant, annoying, whining, postings about things that aren't
  relevant to the group 
* responding with seriously wrong info to a question, and then being
  less than humble about your mistake -- if you don't KNOW, at
  least have the sense not to tell the rest of us you don't know
* posting of "test messages"
* having mail to you fail more than 3 days in a row -- maybe less if
  it's getting to be a problem
* complaining about the above policies 8{)

I admit this is a bit restrictive, but that's life. Quality BEFORE quantity.
This is one of the heaviest traffic mailing lists around, but it is
consistently about the bst in signal-to-noise.

If you *DO* happen to be dropped from the list, you can ask to be 
reinstated.  Should you be dropped due to a bad mailer or something related, 
it's automatic when you ask. If you actually did something stupid, we'll have 
to talk. Don't worry, I'll *TELL* you if you did something stupid...

Third, please remember that not everyone has the latest and greatest screen 
technology at their fingertips.  Keep your text limited to lines less than

BUYING AND SELLING STUFF

People being as they are, from time to time you will see postings saying
"I'm looking to buy a XXX" or "I have some YYY for sale", or similar.
That's fine. In fact, that's greatly to be encouraged -- parts and accessories
for Porsches are hard enough to find at reasonable prices that anything we
can do to help is indeed a service.

Some rules of the road are in order here as well. The standard caveats apply:

1) Don't send money until you see the goods and

2) If it's expensive or there's a trust issue, ship it COD 
   (BTW, I've found that FedEx COD gets your
   money back to you about 8x quicker than UPS COD...)

In addition, the following also apply:

3) Items listed must be Porsche cars, parts, accessories or apply in some
   way to any of the above (i.e. you *can* list your Toyota Landcruiser as
   a tow vehicle, but not your Celica, since speedbumps are very pleantiful)

4) Unless EXPRESSLY STATED IN YOUR NOTE, all items offered for sale must
   be suitable for use without rework or repair.

5) Prices include shipping unless you say explicitly that the buyer
   must pay shipping. If the buyer wants quicker shipping than you want
   to pay for, then he may pay shipping, at is entitled to no reduction 
   in price unless you feel like it.

6) If the buyer is not satisfied with the goods bought, you will let him
   return them at his expense for refund provided that they are returned
   in the condition originally shipped to him, or better.  No other 
   warranties may be assumed unless you offer otherwise.

Have fun, play fair, and let's use our joint piles of parts to keep more
Porsches on the road!

The AutoThority Mass Flow Sensor kit is CA smog legal. Porsche has
switched to Mass Flow sensors as well. Would they do this if there
was no advantage? Mass Flow Sensors are not cheaper so that is not
te reason.

Before people on the list say a product is bad or good, I wish they

Subject: 944 Throttle Response Cam

Hi to all, and wonder if anyone knows or recommends using the 944 Throttle
Response Cam advertised by Performance Products?
I have a 84' 944 with 5 speed and Lmtd Slip Tran.  I also know that this cam
is made by Autothority, and shortens the throttle cable somewhat. One
mechanic I asked, said it would make the car squirrely, and lurch about if we
were not careful how we drove it.
I don't want to put something on the car that might make it errattic, but
might consider it, if it might make any improvements in performance.  Thank
you in advance for any helpful comments.

Scott,

I would politely point out to you that Porsche (etc.) changes product
technologies for more reasons than horsepower and performance.  Anyone
with a CIS sensor plate or Motronic barn door that has hung up due
to age, gunk, or whatnot can appreciate the value of a system with no
moving parts!

In my own case, the resistive element on the PC board inside the air flow
meter is nearing the end of its useful life.  Anyone have a junk air
flow meter from which I could salvage this part?  Since it's a sealed
unit, Bosch does not sell the component.

Subject: 911 Rear Torsion Bar Spring Rates

As I mentioned the other day, I calculated
the spring rates for 911 rear torsion bars.
The units for these rates are a little screwy,
but if you think about it, they make sense.  It 
may be most useful to use these as a comparison
between your particular bars and other sizes
(to note the % increase or decrease in stiffness).

Anyway here they are:

Bar DIA             Spring rate

23 mm               552 in-lbs/degree
24.1 mm            665 in-lbs/degree
25 mm               770 in-lbs/degree
26 mm               901 in-lbs/degree
27 mm               1048 in-lbs/degree
28 mm               1212 in-lbs/degree
30 mm               1598 in-lbs/degree

To put these into real-life terms, 690 lbs of force
applied at the rear tire of a 69-77 911 (approximately
the weight of the vehicle at that point) will result in about 19
degrees of rotation of the torsion bar which is about
6.4 inches of spring plate movement. 

If anyone wants to pick this apart further, just
contact me...

Subject: A reply re: 944 Throttle Response Cam


I had one of these Autothority cams in my 85/1 944. The first thing I have
to say is that it wil *NOT* make the car squirrely or likely to lurch about,
because it only introduces a very small change in the car's behavior. (Also
the car only has approx 150HP, so let's not get carried away. We're not
talking about a 1100HP CanAm car.)

The new cam does NOT make the throttle cable shorter. Rather it changes the
relationship between gas pedal position and amount of throttle opening.
Since the end points are left as-is (ie no gas, no throttle; full gas fully
open throttle -- for both stock and Autothority), the cam influences the
'engagement curve', as we might call it.

The cam is quite visible at the top of the engine, with the throttle cable
travelling around it.  The stock cam is non-linear:  it looks like an
ear-lobe, and its shape means that a given delta of gas pedal engagement at
the early part of gas-pedal travel causes LESS throttle opening than the same
delta when the pedal is near full throttle.  The effect of this is the stock
944 is designed to give artifically low thrust at small gas-pedal openings.
(It also means that you get an extra increment of throttle opening for each
delta of gas-pedal when you are near full-throttle.)


The Autothority cam is perfectly round -- not at all ear-lobe shaped. This
means that the engagement curve is linear: ie a delta at the early part of
gas-pedal travel causes the same amount of throttle opening as the same delta
at near-full gas-pedal travel.

So, what does this all mean?  I used this thing for a while, and certainly
noticed that the car took-off from rest with more alacrity.  I did stop using
it, though, because I found it harder to drive the car in traffic.  However,
there was a decided improvement in low-end power -- all psychological, but
noticeable nonetheless.


Why did Porsche use a non-linear cam? My guess is,  for 3 reasons.   The
car  is easy to start from rest smoothly, and it probably gets better mpg
in  the traffic cycle.  It also 'seems' to have more thrust at near-full
throttle, since the derivative of throttle opening versus gas-pedal travel
is so much greater when the gas-pedal is near the full open position.

But I did give it away to someone .....

Ok you've got a problem but all is not necessarily lost.  Bolts
are one of the best understood fasteners (hey that Mechanical
engineering degree is coming in handy).  Torqueing to or into
the yield point is fairly common, in fact in the correct
applications a bolt tightened this way that doesnt break on
installation will probably never break (Machine Design by
Shigley).  Anyway more to the point it is unlikely that brembo
has special bolts made, more likely they are using v. high
strength standard ones - US = class 8 Metric = something else, I
dont have a machine design book handy.  Tightening torque can
then be calculated given the type of bolt - get a machine design
text or a handbook for mech engineers.  Buyer beware, since
substandard bolts are in the various pipelines and falure would
not be exactly pleasent (I'd try talking to brembo directly). 
If you want more details I'll try to dig out the info at home.

Since, this weekend was so nice here, I decided to take my 77 911 out
for a little drive.  When I was pulling out of the garage, I stepped on the 
brake peddle and I stopped but the peddle didn't come back up (and the brake
light went on).  I noticed the brake fluid container was empty, so I
filled it up and started to get ready to bleed the brakes.  My Haynes 
manual says there is two bleeder valves on the rear wheels, an inner and
outer.  Well, when I took the rear wheels off I only found one.  It was
pointing towards the engine and was on top of the brake housing.  I 
never did find a second valve on either rear wheel, is the manual correct?
Where is the second valve supposed to be?

Thanks for the reply Adrian

I have done all maintenance on my 951 except the belt tension
(do not have tool) so I let the local 'multi-discipline' dealer
do it. (in my shop for about $35)

I've done lots of little stuff, the h20 pump the only major effort.
although the radiator got broken and needed replacement $350 ouch!

I also made some aux driving lights and wired them into the existing
relay (US ver. has relay but did not connect to anything-strange)

Despirately need to change the two bad Motor Mounts -  would like to
find a used set to rebuild myself with neoprene-rubber
the factory ones suck-they only last 25k miles. 
They are to damn expensive for
that kind of service life. (although can get 'good' used ones for $60 ea.)

Two additional problems recently came up. One is leaky rear oil seal/crank
oil seal. The other is turbo water pump leakage.  How do you suggest tackling
the oil seal problem?  remove the exaust & drive tube? what tools for 
getting the flywheel off?  Second is the stinkin water pump (which
was changed under warantee already)  which seems to have a crack in it.  Maby
there is a way to fix?? or at least change the plastic pump and
not hte whole elec motor ect...

951S/968 speaker sys & decklid/hatch tail/fin sound like good future projects.

The only thing on this car that has really pissed me off is the rear hatch
glass.  The glass refuses to sit in the Al frame correctly and despite
removal & restoration still does not work correctly.  I have not heared
anyone else complain so it must have been damaged.  I guess a new/reclaimed
hatch frame will be required - ring ring hello Austin VeeDub got a hatch frame???

A lot of the wear depends on you.

You can put essentially no wear on the tires, but then you probably
won't learn as much as you could by driving harder.

On the other hand, you could probably scrub off about 25% of the 
tread if you *really* worked at it.  That is if your instructors
allowed you to continue driving...

I attended the school several years ago on street tires (goodyear
vr50's and p7's (blech)).  I probably used about 2/32".  That
was at crow's landing.  On concrete.  The school is scheduled
for candlestick.  On asphalt.  You should use less than 2/32".

I instructed at the last zone 7 school and one of my students did 
not attend the second day because he was into 
the cord by 3:00 the first day.  He'd planned on "finishing off" the
tires at the school...

>Why would they not want us to use real AX tires?

You are not going to this school to set course records.  You are going
(hopefully) to learn to drive.

You do not need super sticky tires to learn to drive.

Now, what do I mean by "learning to drive?"

It's easiest to answer this by describing the school format and what 
we expect to teach you.

By the way, I expect to be instructing at the upcomming school, and 
another p-philes member (Dave Blanchard) is also a zone 7 instructor
and is usually there.

First day:

A number of different exercises are set up to work on one or two
different techniques/skills at a time; in an auto-x you would be
trying to learn more like 6 or 8 skills at once.  The exercises 
are intended to isloate the different skills to maintain focus.

Some of the exercises and what you should learn:

   Skid pad.  Learn traction limits, throttle steering.

   Oval.  Gear shifting, late apex turns.

   Double box.  Linking turns, throttle steering.

   Slalom.  Smooth line, entry and exit.

   Triangle.  Late apex, trail braking.

   Chicane.  Late apex, linking turns.


The second day, two auto-x courses are set up, typically a "fast"
course and a "technical" course.

Here, the individual skills learned the first day are integrated and
more emphasis is placed on optimizing the entire course:  why you have
to give up speed in one place to get speed in another, how you set up
for the first of a serries of turns in order to be set up for all of 
them, which is the most important turn on the course and why is it 
important, and what do you do about it?  I could go on.

The most important thing to learn is the correct "line."

If you learn the correct line to take through a course, you will 
continue to go faster with time.  If you do not learn the correct line,
nothing will ever make you fast.


>By the way, what is the current thought on who makes
>the best AX tire? Goodyear? Yoko? Goodrich?

Yeah, one of them.  Best how?

I use the yokos (aoo8rs, not rsii).  I think the goodrich has a 
slightly better turn in, but boy do those things wear out fast!  
I don't like to buy more than one set of tires a season!  Were 
talking $600/set by the time they're on the car.

The goodyears look like they would wear even faster: treadwear 
rating of *20*.  For reference, bfg's (204's) are 50 an rs's are 80.

Tire rack is probably the cheapest way to go.  They have two warehouses,
be sure they ship from the closer one (nevada for the zone 7 folk).

By the way, does anyone know about the Hoosier auto-x tires?  They 
make a 245:45:15!!  *and* the prices seem reasonable!

Subject: 911 engine/driveline

Just a short note to diffuse the hate mail:

1.  MFS conversions

Point of comment--do other things first to make your car faster, driver being
first priority.  If you all want MFS (or chips of any kind), here's what I'll
do:  sell them at whatever cost is.  Everyone get their money together and
I'll make a one-time-only order to get a decent price.  You can all have a
copy of the actual invoice, so you know I'm not jerking anyone around.  Let
me know!

2.  work experience

I had a shop, Phoenix Rennsport (Porsche/BMW), after I got out of college
(1985-88) and got back into engine building for extra money when I, gasp,
went to law school.  Thankfully I have this to fall back on for now.  I make
more money doing this than I would as a lawyer with all but the biggest
firms.  Plus I only work about 4 days a week. I built 17 engines and 14
transaxles last year.  I have actually raced very little since 1988 because
of that.  But my "new" car is almost ready.  I'm just saving up to buy a
business now (not auto related).

Anyone who wants to scream and yell at me can do so at 510-568-5171.  It's
your phone bill!

Subject: RE: 951/Brembo Brake Problem

I didn't want to get into this but...

Brembo is most likely using "stretch" bolts that have maximum effectiveness
at a particular torque, but break if taken much past that *OR IF RE-USED*.

Since you can get stretch bolts in a variety of denominations for the
stretch point torque, it's a jumbo crap shoot as to whether or not you 
get the right value when you re-build the unit...

Best bet: call someone at Stainless Steel Brake, the guys who re-build
older brake calipers with stainless inserts and pistons. Maybe *they*
know the value if they've ever rebuilt these suckers. Second plan:
try Automechanika in Englewood, CO. They have a special deal with Brembo
to make the BremTek mondo calipers and may know the values...

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What can you tell me about the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          President, NetSmiths, Ltd.
          2025 Lincoln Highway
          Edison, NJ 08817

     He lives in Houston TX and works in Edison NJ (Don't bitch about 
*YOUR* commute): 
          Houston: e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
                   voice:  (713) 661-2084 
                   FAX:    (713) 661-0633
          Edison:  e-mail: stan@netsmiths.com 
                   voice:  (908) 287-8070 
                   FAX:    (908) 287-3883

     His cars currently include:  
          '81 Euro 911SC Targa (daily driver when he's where it is)
          '74 914 2.0 (SCCA ITA/PCA Club Racing)
          '64 356 SC (OK, so he fell in love again).

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How is the list maintained?
     
     The list is maintained fairly regularly.  Stan tries to handle
changes at least once every other day.  There will probably be times
when he's on the road and less able to deal with problems, so be
patient.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  You can also 
reach Stan by phone at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070 when he's not
traveling.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What about Unix-based mail problems with the list?

     If you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay attention to 
your replies.  The default will send the reply to the "porschephiles-
request" address, as it is the UUCP "From" address (first actual line 
of the mail header).  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT STAN ROUTINELY TRASHES SUCH 
MIS-ROUTED MAIL!  If your mailer starts screwing up, you will be dropped
from the list.  Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any 
more, send Stan mail and he will do his best to figure out what's
happening.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the copyrights or ownership of material sent to the list?

     The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence
by and between members of a closed community.  As such, the copyright
for EVERYTHING that ANYONE posts lies with them.  PERIOD.  This is 
*NOT* a bulletin board system, where consent for further redistribution
is implied by nature of the the system; it's PRIVATE.  If you wish to
use something written by someone on the list, you must first seek their
permission unless they specifically grant the right in that specific
posting to reprint it at will.  And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD idea
to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing
up down the line.  Remember, when you read something on this list: what
you are reading belongs to whoever wrote it.  They may have plans to
publish it further themselves.  They may want to keep it "private"
(i.e. just for list member use).  They may not care what gets done with
it.  It's still theirs, and before re-use, permission must be
obtained.  Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a
big deal about it.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available via FTP at tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/
Archives in five subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94) each of which has 
the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  Period!!!  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM
CST, or Stan may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to
mail you archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to
use BINARY mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX
"uncompress" program, or equivalent, to restore to textual format.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What else is available in the tta.com archives in /pub/porschephiles?

     FAQs: This FAQ; also specific FAQs about specific Porsche models
are being added (so far there's only one, for the 914--feel free to
contribute one on YOUR favorite Porsche).
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
            1970.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914, 1976.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
            of the four-cylinder engine.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 to the 944 powerplant.
            Aerodynamically the best Porsche ever made.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the
            front, water-cooled, has grown from an original 4.5 litres 
            to 5.4 today.
     930  - Turbocharged 911, homologation and street version of the
            racing 934.
     931  - Turbocharged 924, available in 1980 and 1981.
     944  - Front-engined, water-cooled inline four cylinder car, with
            nearly perfect 50/50 weight bias.  Sixteen-valve and
            turbocharged versions were produced.  Produced from 1982
            through 1991. 2.5 litre displacement, except for a 2.7 litre
            eight-valve 944 model in 1989 and the 3.0 litre 944S2.
     951  - The turbo version of the 944.  Built from 1985 to 1991.
     959  - Supercar 911 derivative.  2.85 litre, four valve, twin cam,
            dual turbochargers, all-wheel drive.
     964  - Another name for the 911 Carrera 4 and Carrera 2 as introduced
            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, due in showrooms in 4/94.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the meanings of terms and acronyms I've seen in the list?

     FAQ  - Frequently asked questions (but you knew that)
     IMHO - In my humble opinion
     IMO  - In my opinion
     PCA  - Porsche Club of America, the major US/Canada Porsche
            enthusiasts organization
     POC  - Porsche Owner's Club, the *other* US Porsche owner's group;
            in the past they have been more competition-oriented than 
            PCA, which has many interest groups participating
     PCGB - Porsche Club of Great Britain
     PCNA - Porsche Cars of North America (Reno, NV), the US importer
     PANO - Not an acronym; this stands for Porsche Panorama, the PCA 
            national monthly magazine
     PAG  - Porsche AG, the mother company back in Stuttgart; "AG"
            stands for "Aktiengesselschaft," which means that the 
            company has publicly traded stock
     YMMV - Your mileage may vary
     :-)  - Smiley face (turn your head 90 degrees to the left to "read"
            it); various iterations exist using different ASCII 
            characters
    
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the major Porsche periodicals besides Porsche Panorama?


     Excellence -
       Independent magazine devoted to Porsches.  Many of the same
       authors you see in Panorama, less jingoistic in their praise
       for everything PCNA brings to market.

       US rates: $20 one year, $35 two years, $49 three years
       foreign (incl. Canada): US$27 one, $49 two, $69 three years

       Excellence
       Circulation Dept.
       P.O. Box 1529
       Ross, CA  94957
       telephone: 415-382-0580


     Christophorus -
       Porsche AG's official magazine.  Very good source of some

What are some of the major Porsche aftermarket suppliers?

     Be aware when buying a part in the aftermarket that it may or may
not be the same part you would get from Porsche.  This holds true even
when the part carries the "correct" Porsche part number, and when it
carries Porsche's parts trademark.  The following suppliers, listed
alphabetically, have been praised by various Porschephiles:

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:
Information about water-cooled cars is lacking; those with favorites
should submit them to one of the names at the end of this FAQ.)

There are also Haynes manuals available for most models.  While the
Haynes manuals tend to be very weak on specifics having to do with
different model years and variations, they are good at teaching how-to
procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other well-known Porsche people) here?
 
     Bruce was invited to join and did so back in '91. The load then
was too much for him.  All of what, 2k a day or so.  Now, at 15x to 20x
that load, he probably doesn't want back on.  He's not stupid -- he 
knows where we are.

     No specifics are available regarding other renowned Porsche people.

Subject: 944 trans noise

This morning on the way to work the transmission on my '83 944 began
making a strange noise (a new one, not one of the assortment of
"normal" noises for my daily driver). In second gear, and only second,
a loud "whining" noise comes from the transmission. It sounds almost
like the gears are not lubricated and the noise increases in pitch
as the engine speed increases. It seems unrelated to road speed and
the noise is not present in any other gear. I also have no problems
or abnormal noises when shifting gears. Any ideas?
	I also have had a strange, unrelated problem. At the end of my
hour long commute home last week (I would not want to spend an hour
and a half a day on the road in anything but a Porsche) the idle speed would
oscilate between 1000 rpm and 1400 rpm with a period of approximately
one second. The engine speed would slowly increase to 1.4k and then
suddenly drop back down to 900-1000RPM. It only did this at the end
of the commute and everything else seemed to be normal, no stumbling,
temperature was normal, etc. Has anyone else on the net seen anything
like this.
	On another note I may as well get my 2 cents in - I love driving
my snow tire equiped 944 on the occasionally snow packed roads around
Chicago. Other than the two aforementioned "curiosities" and an 
occasionally sticky door handle I have not had any problems with the
cold (knock on wood). I know that this is not the kindest treatment for
a fine German driving tool but dang it's fun.
	Thanks for any thoughts on these subjects.

Has anyone had experience with Automotion Euromeister wheels? I'd like
to put 16" wheels on my 1986 944, but the only Porsche wheels that
will fit the 23.3 mm offset are phone dials and Fuchs alloys. Both are
nice, but I prefer the look of the C2 7-spoke or newer 5-spoke. The
Automotion wheels are on sale now. The price and the look are good,
but I'd appreciate any comments on quality.

Folks,

Stan pointed out to me that I failed to mention my car model and year,
this in the context of the failing resistive element in my air flow

I kind of assumed, perhaps incorrectly, that most Bosch air flow meters

Fred, very nice write-up!  Thanks.

There is another reason why Porsche would like the power to come on
mildly.  Many, many owners are not particularly smooth in their
shifting.  Less torque means less wear and tear on the rubber centre
or springs, not to mention the friction disk.

(I say this with all humility, having had Jim Selders spend a bunch of
time teaching me how to properly shift, a number of years ago.)

Subject: A.C. in 911

   I know to anybody who store their 911 during winters, this may 
    seem untimely; but has anyone with a 911 been able to get cold
    Air Conditioning ? And have it stay cold for more than a few weeks ?
    I've read Alan Caldwell's article about opening up the ductwork, etc,
    I'm interested in whatever success anybody has had with extra condensors,
    etc. Am I wrong but has the primary condensor on the C2 been moved 
    off the engine vent ? Where did it go ?

   I installed 2 jc whitney condensors underneath my '75 911, ala Porscheair's
    conversion, and the performance did improve a little; but even without a 
    lowered car, it wasn't too long before one had gotten bent. I did a lot
    of work looking for a condensor/fan arrangement that might fit in the
    left rear quarter, also one that would replace the water bottle in the
    left front but never tried either (yes, give up my headlight washers
    for keeping down to a modest sweat during mid July....)

   I'm curious if anyone out there has needed their A.C. on a hot day and
    actually been happy. I'm in a 928 now (which cools great) but there
    is still an SC in the family and...

Who was it that said "If wishes were horses, beggars

My idea of a *second* car is something safe, cheap
to operate and repair, reliable, unafraid of any
weather or salt and something I can drive to the 
mall and not worry about it getting stolen or dented.

Sure, I'd like to have something like a 968 as a

But then if wishes were horses ...

Pam,
        My "other" car or (my wife's) is a Mitsu Galant '93.  We love the 
car.  It's reliable, has good weight behind it (for a Japanese car)
and actually fun to drive.  We have the 5 speed manual, not the
automatic, so the car gets up and goes (as well as it can).
        Bottom line, we went thru the same procedure you did, and compared
to the Lexus, Honda, Toyota, etc. we found the Galant to be the best
buy for the money.  I think it also was the pick of Consumers Report.
Good luck,

as far as I can make out is the same size 
bellhousing etc. 

Does anyone know whether it is possible
to fit this? Someone told me they use
different size transshafts.

Is this true?

Has anyone tried this conversion?

Subject: 911 A/C

Reference Lee Atkinson's question of 8 Feb, "has anyone with a 911 been
able to get cold Air Conditioning ?"

I have a '77 911S in Florida and I have good metalic tinted windows to help
keep the heat out.  And even after having my a/c "fixed" I could not get my
car cool.  The air coming out was cool, but it just would not enough volume
to cool the car.  Then one hot afternoon last summer while driving home
from work, I was reached up the dash and disconnected the hose that runs
from the a/c to the eyebrow vent by the door - just to see how much air was
coming to that point.  I was amazed - my car got cool. In another mile I
reached over and disconnected the other side vent and my car gold cold!  I
actually had to turn down the a/c.  

Basically, both hoses now hang down (you don't see them unless you are down
on the floor).  I have thought about a way to make it look more
sophisticated than that - but what the H - it more than keeps me cool now. 


I only have the a/c package as installed Porsche (no additions).  I am
thinking of replacing the original condenser with a rotary unit, more for
efficiency than cooling capability.

Subject: don't shoot me

Since someone decided to test their hammer or some such other
pointed/heavy/blunt device on the roof on my '70 911 I'm getting
the roof repaired and repainted.  Because the paint is really
pretty nice and because I'm not prepared to fund a repaint, I've
worked into the deal some touch-up of all noticable scratches
and chips.

This is a color change car (was dog doo brown, now black) that someone
did a pretty good repaint on some years before I purchased.  One
area being touched up is the panel in front of the windshield where
the wipers and washers reside, as the paint is peeling around one
of the washers.  Since the entire panel is being repainted, I was
considering removing the washers and simply filling the holes.  They 
don't work right, don't fit tight, and until the car gets a proper
repaint will always be a potential paint-chip area.

Any thoughts?

thanks,
Mark

Btw, this is 100% out of my pocket as the estimate to repair and repaint
the roof was less than my $500 deductible.

As I'm looking out my window at the 5-8 inch accumulation of snow
in the parking lot,  I find it hard to believe that I'm actually answering
this... But my wife *did* call from Houston a few minutes ago and ask where
the cut-over switch from heat to A/C is... (it's 80+ in Houston now)

Not really. I did some "paper" work on this and I *think* the best
you can do is 20 degrees F. difference in inlet and outlet air temp.

>   I've read Alan Caldwell's article about opening up the ductwork, etc,

that's a good start, but the real issue is this: how do you get the
already semi-cooled air inside the car *back* through the evaporator
again and again and again...

Which is why you *USE* the unit form Performance Aire. When I was out there
in summer of '90 I guess (try 7/90 and 8/90 archives) they gave a very
impressive demo of jacking the car up with the condensor, hitting it 
with hammers, etc.

Also Performance Aire -- they have one for the rear quarter.

I'm always put in mind of a conversation I had with Sam Shalala about 
A/C on 911s where he recounted sitting in line at a McDonalds drive-
through watching some "little girl" driving a Toyota in front of him.
"Her hair was blowing all which ways, and there was practicly frost
on her windows as I was sitting there watching sweat drip from my nose
*KNOWING* that my left camshaft costs more than her whole f'ing car
and wondering why the hell I can't get an A/C that works for this car."

Live with it. I only put A/C/ in mine because I was taking clients places.

I'll *EVENTUALLY* have some, both of a couple of concours restorations

the pix are in Houston, I'm in NJ, and I need to scare up a scanner...

I'd like to be able to accommodate everyone that wants to submit a picture

In reply to your message about Mass flow systems:

	I refer you to the porschefiles rules; If you don't know about
something don't bother to answer the message. I know mass flow systems
work, I've installed a few. They are CA. legal so we know you don't know
everything. As a shop owner I have to say you must not have very good
bussiness sense if you are willing to sell these things for cost just to
prove some point (whatever that may be). Don't make much sense to me.

As for Quaifes and Factory LSD's:

	You must keep in mind that anyone can break anything given enough
time. I have seen factory LSD's break too. But you are probably right
about one thing, it does take 930 power to break one.

	May I make a suggestion that you be a little more reasonable in
your responses to the net. Not everyone out here has never built engines
and transmissions you know.

Subject: 944 Idle Speed

Hi everyone.  I hope that the following question isn't so simple that it is
considered a waste of bandwidth here.  However, I am at the beginning of the
learning curve about my car since nothing has ever really gone wrong before.
Anyhow, I have an '83 944.  The idle speed is very low.  Usually, it idles at
about 450 rpm or so, which causes a lot of vibration.  In cold weather, the
engine sometimes idles at 100 rpm or so (if the tach can be relied upon at those
low readings), barely on the edge of stalling, at least until it warms up.

In my younger days I tinkered with 2-stroke engines in snowmobiles, and they had
a simple idle speed adjustment screw.  My mother, who has an '89 928S4, tells me
that there is a similar screw in my car.  Of course, she can't remember where it
is and she lives 5,000 km away and therefore can't look under the hood with me.
Can anyone help me find this screw?  My question is based on the assumption that
finding this screw will solve my problems.  Since I am no expert on Porsche
engines, I welcome anyone's advice if in fact there is no such thing as an idle
speed adjustment screw on a 944 or if my problem is more complex than I think.
Thanks in advance for your help!

Everything has some effect on the proper setup here, so don't make a lot of

	I have seen something very similar with my 85/2 944, although this
usually happened when the car was first started. When I jiggled the
electrical connector to the auxiliary air valve (which hides under the

it with some switch cleaner and haven't seen the problem since. Hope this

 Sorry for a late posting but it appears that our mail reaches us

I also own a 85-1/2 944 and have noticed this same strange behavior
where my car would rev between 900-1.3k (for last 2-weeks). Later I
discovered a hole in the muffler and associated it as the root of
the problem. Neither, have I had my muffler fixed nor do I have any
scientific theory to prove this :-)

But recently (i.e. last 3 Days) after a 15-minutes warm-up in the
drive-way when I drove the car to the train station (8-miles
drive) it seems to idle on or about a constant rev of 2000-RPM. Since,
last night I have discovered another problem. The car still idles
at 2k for the first 10-12 minutes of road driving time and then the
idle seems to drop to around 400-RPM.

Naturally, if I don't gas it the engine would die. It seems to re-start
fine and idles at 1.1k but I didn't have the patience to wait and see
it the behavior repeats itself on the re-start.

Rule number one: be courteous, i.e. don't be a dick. Go back and *RE-READ*
Ken's responses. He never said they didnt' work, just that they
weren't magic. And OK, he *was* wrong about them being CARB legal - maybe.
In the fine print, Automotion says the *software* is CARB legal, but
it doesn't say about the hardware. And, since CARB-legality isn't a
big deal for me, I never paid any attention.  Nonetheless, it's a
minor point. 

Impugning Ken's business sense also isn't very smart -- for starters,
he's obviously doing something right or he wouldn't be making more building
engines than he would if he went back to practicing law.. In the
second place, he made a *VERY NICE* offer to the community, and I just

Again, he said that he had an LSD laying around because he'd swapped it

Subject: strange noise 


Hi, fellow porschephiles!

I have an 85 1/2 944 and lately I noticed a strange noise coming from
the back side.  It sounds like something is rattling in the back and it
always happens at 2300 rpm.  It almost sounds like the wheel is rubbing
against the body, but it's not that (I checked).  The noise comes on 
at 2300 rpm and disappears as soon as it gets past 2400 rpm.  
I can hear this almost every time the tachometer reaches 2300, but it
is more noticeable at higher speeds.  Sometimes while idling there's a 
distinct rattle in the back (I tend to believe that what sounds like 
a rattle at no speed, creates the grinding noise at higher speeds).
At lower speeds the noise is very sporadic.  I can shift from 1 to 2
and 2 to 3 without hearing the noise and still go past 2300 rpms. 
I thought that it might be the exhaust pipe touching the frame, but
why would it do it at 2300 rpm only?  

Anyway, I would appreciate all input on this (source, price,
recommendations).  


Thanks, Sorin

        A long while back I posted a note of 3.0 engine noises upon
de-acceleration. Kinda tingy, kinda Popping. Net Wisdom, and thanks to
those who responded was leaking exhaust. Now for the full story...

* I checked the exhaust - couldn't find any leaks, re-gasketed the cat/muffler
cat/exchanger/cross-over pipe. No difference.

* Thought I might be way off track - so I was worried it was perhaps a ring
slap. Bought a MAC leakdown tester (98.00 - real nice). Results 3-4-5% leakdown
between cylinders. Not bad for an engine with 160k miles eh ?. Problem still
not resolved.

* Said " what the Heck " Spend a little at the local dealer who will *quickly*
pinpoint th problem. 

* Dropped it off Monday - at a *good* dealer in Palo Alto *  (no names...).
Told them of the problem. Set max at 200.00 to diag and fix.

* Pick up the car - told couln't adjust co2 - screw messed up. Cat cap
rounded off - but we fixed the problem. - No they didn't ! Bill 195.00

* Re-Delivered Car next day - they spend 3 hours - now fixed I'm told. Pick
it up - same problem. They make me go for a drive in another customers 80
to *show* that the sound is normal. Of course the other car is as quite a
mouse. New mechanic thinks it is plug wires cross firing - since I didn't
have stainless steel wires installed. No charge for the day. Co2 was
adjusted - as I took the sensor off the night before - only to find that
the screw was perfectly fine, and the cat cap was not rounded off. No
charge for that days suppossed 2-3 hours work

* What the heck - the old plug wires are pretty cruddy - Vertex 159.00 to
the rescue. Looks nice - same problem though. Now I'm just a little pissed.

* Back under the car - I check again ( net wisdom for leaks..) Opps I start
to hear via stethescope leaking at the cross over pipe. Mig to the rescue -
although with cooling I also get cracks and air pin holes. Mig more and
finally
get things resolved. No difference. Blood pressure rising...

* Dublin - home of a supposed excellent non dealer porsche shop. Quick
visit. Mechanic test ride - > werid noise - never heard it this bad before,
could be leak in exhaust. Boy back to sq. one. Cost: 10.00 donation to his
beer night. 

* Gotta be something in exhaust. Cross over pipe looks so patched - check

Subject: Re: 944 Idle Speed

Hubert,

A few things to say.  First, you car prbably isn't idling at the low
speeds you mention.  I'd be impressed if it could idle below 600 RPM.
First step is to measure the idle with a reliable instrument.

There is, I believe, an idle adjustment screw in the throttle body.  I
say this with some hesitation because when we went looking for mine last
week, we found what appears to be an unfinished bore in the casting,
with no idle screw.  However, my car is a 944S with a different throttle
body and engine management system than the eight-valvers.  And I seem
to recall looking up the t-screw part number for someone not too long
ago...

Finally, unless someone has previously monkeyed with the idle setting,
I'd first assume you have some other problem such as a vacuum leak in
the induction system or an air leak in the exhaust.  Actually, I
wouldn't assume anything; I'd get the car on a Sun analyser and measure
the idle and exhaust gas values, and then decide whether anything's
busted.

Happy hunting, let us know what you find.

Subject: Zone 7 auto-x school info

Hi everyone,

I have received a few requests for information regarding the 
zone 7 auto-x school.

I talked with Henry Watts this afternoon.  The "class" holds about
90 people.  There are about 65 people signed up as of 2/8/94.

25 slots are still available.

The class is geared towards the begining and intermediate auto-x
driver.  I had one student last year (my best student in fact) that
had only owned the car for a few months.  

If you have been toying with autocrossing but somehow not managed to 
get out and do it (if this statement seems directed at you, it probably
is!), now's the time.

The school is focused on learning and having fun.  It really is fun
and you really will learn a lot.

If you're interested attend.  If you've never autocrossed before, 
this is a great time to start, more relaxed than just showing up
at an auto-x.

The focus is on teaching you how to drive, not on driving the 
fastest.

By the way, my best student last year was a woman (yeah, the one that
had only had the car a few months), so take the opportunity to 
show up your husband/boyfriend.  That happened when I attended the 
school, it was *his* car and *she* drove it better.  He was very quiet.

Car prep (covered in detail in drivers packet sent out before school):

   Your car must have good brakes and tires.
   Battery *must* be securly fastened.
   Wheel bearing should not be loose.  Some (minimal) play is normal.

   Valves should be adjusted and oil clean - these are not safety issues
   like the above list but you will be driving the car harder than usual.


Here are the particulars:

When:      4/30/94 - 5/1/94

Where:     Candlestick Park, S.F.

How much:  $98  includes "Secrets of Solo Driving," no you cannot
           get a discount if you already have the book.  At least
           I couldn't 3 years ago.

If you would like to attend you may call Henry at (408) 245-4040

    OR

Send him a check (for $98/driver payable to PCA/LPR) and the 
following information:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Name:

Address:


Phone:

Number of autocrosses attended:

Number of zone 7 schools you have attended:

Are you a PCA member (y/n):

Car model and year:

Car color:

Car License #:

Where you heard about the school:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------


Mail to:  Zone 7 Autocross School, 849 Gary Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94086


NOTE: 

      PCA membership is not required.

      You must be 18 years old to attend.

      Two drivers may attend in the same car without any loss of 
      track time or instruction.  

      All of the information listed above is *required*.  If there
      are two drivers using the same car, inlcude appropriate info
      for *each* driver.

      Cost is $98/driver.

Subject: 911 Rear Suspension Mods

Two short 911 suspension questions:

1) The front of my Carrera 3 Sport has just been lowered with stiffer
'sports' shocks fitted. The effect is dramatic in terms of feel and in
reducing pitch. However the rear now feels very soft, it terms of
standing at the bumper and pushing down, should both ends feel as stiff
as each other (I realise this is a crude method determination).

2) Has anyone any experience of widening the rear track of 911s. I
thought I would like to increase the standard track as there is quite
a bit of room in the flared arch with the standard 8" rims. Any idea
how far I should go without bending the lip, and how this should best
be done.

Dunno who you're flaming, but I certainly disagree with you.  When you
say "mass flow systems work," exactly what is it you're saying?  That they
are capable of making an engine run?  Sure.  That they increase
horsepower?  How much?  Responsiveness/driveability/total performance?
Put a number on it, buddy.  I don't believe it, and I am sure it would
show up neither on our chassis dyno nor in lap times at the track.

I think it makes excellent business sense to sell something like this
at cost if you don't believe in it.  How can you justify selling mouse
milk to a customer and making a big mark-up?  What kind of long-term
relationship can you build that way?  How about your reputation?

We just un-sold an expensive set of Ruf wheels to a customer.  The car
is a punched out 3.4 litre Carrera with custom engine management
and induction systems.  Lots of work, big bucks.  He just had to have
the Ruf wheels.  But they weigh like twice what the 16" Fuchs rims do,
and all that weight is an extra .5" out from the axle.  You can imagine,
and we felt in the seat of our pants, what that did to performance.
Well, he finally listened, and he's much happier for it.  He'll be back.

Subject: help with 911s calipers


 I'm just about ready to put the 911s front end on my
 914. However, I have a problem with the calipers. When
 I took the pistons out to clean out the bores and put
 in new seals I noticed that each caliper had a small
 box-like cover on the outside. Removing the four allens
 which retained the cover revealed a square cross-section
 O-ring. They were pretty toasted and so I decided to
 replace them. 

 Now the problem: the standard brake kit doesn't include
 these o-rings and the 'fiche doesn't call them out at
 all. So I can't get them from Porsche.

 Does anyone know where I can get these seals? Does anyone
 have them to sell me in a parts bin? I'm pretty desperate
 as no one here in the Bay Area seems to know about these.

 For the record, these calipers are the alloy "s" model
 calipers from the 1967-1973 Porsche 911. They were 
 expensive even used and they are the last step in upgrading
 my suspension. 

 So I'm mildly frustrated (to be understated) that I cannot
 find these seals.

 many thanks in advance for any help,

Hubert,

>Can anyone help me find this screw?

It should be somewhere on top of the throttle body.  I seem to recall
having to remove a plastic cap to access it on the '84 I used to own.
This adjustment should be made in coordination with setting the idle
mixture at the air flow meter.  Fiddling with the throttle by-pass
alone might help, but it might also mask the "real" problem,
elsewhere.

I've got one noisy set of valves and I'm gonna check the adjustment.
It sounds like it's one of the cylinders on the right side. Any hints
I should know about? Any special tools (like I think I'm going to need
an offset screwdriver -- which isn't a special tool unless you don't
have one)? Which valve is which?  Haynes sez the outer valves are the
exhaust valves...does that mean the valve all the way forward, and the
one all the way aft?

Too bad they didn't build these with an engine/transmission quick
release system. Pop the engine out, adjust the valves, pop it back in.
Quick release connectors on all the plumbing and wiring...

Hello pfiler's

Maybe it's my Norwegian Heritage, but I didn't feel the attack on
Ken's(race911) opinions was *THAT* heavy. To me it only seemed as a
personal opinion against Ken's. Even if the language were a bit edgy I
can't see a reason for a *lot* of apology's. 
Of course if I remember correct, the 'action' Ken was about to do was
called stupid, not Ken himself.(didn't save the 'debate') We all do
a lot of stupid things now and then, this doesn't mean we *are* stupid???!!!!

I don't know much of mass flow metering, but changes sure work in some
set-ups.On the other hand, Bosch (it's their systems that are
'manipulated', isn't it??) put huge amount into development and this
mean ; they are already (almost) optimal for the given engine.

One thing I do know more about is the fact that changing one 'ingredient'
in an engine,to get more performance, most often is worthless.
I guess this could be what Ken tries to tell us(????), and I agree.

In some cases,( for instance the US 911's,???) engines are detuned, with
restrictions in the injection systems or retarded ignition timing to
meet emmission restrictions. In these cases a lot of power can be
released with small modifications.But then most often it is illegal.

I 100 % agree with the Listmeister that personal attacks should be banned,
but personal opinions is important, and isn't that what it's all

From: ag323@freenet.carleton.ca (Randy Evans)
Subject: Re: 944 Idle Speed

I have had various minor idle problems with my '85/2 944. *All* of the
problems have be cased by electrical components. I suggest cleaning all of
the electrical connectors under the hood. For each connector, unplug it,
spray it with contact cleaner and plug it back in. If you can get at it,
clean the big connector that attaches the wiring harness to the computer.
In my car, the computer is inside the passenger compartment, under a
wooden panel against the bottom of the firewall on the passenger side of
the car.

I had one problem where the idle would bounce between 1000 and 2500 RPM.
Cleaning the connector on the oxygen sensor cable fixed that problem.

A month ago another problem occurred - the engine would not rev past 1700
RPM. It would die at exactly 1700 RPM and then spring back to life when
the revs dropped below 1200 RPM. The problem never occurred when I parked
the car in a heated garage. It happened more frequently as the morning
temperatures got colder. Sometimes it went away when the engine warmed up.
I felt very sheepish driving a Porsche that could not go any faster than
45 MPH!

The cause turned out to be the throttle position switch. It was frozen in
the position where it was telling the computer that the throttle was
closed all the time. I was able to work around the problem by leaving the
cable connector unplugged from the switch. The side effects are that I
have to press the throttle slightly as the car is warming up from a cold
start, the engine sometimes idles at 2000 RPM, and the engine takes longer
to drop down to idle speed when I take my foot off the gas pedal. Of
course, I will replace the switch in the spring, it's just too *damn* cold
to work on the car right now!

While playing with the throttle position switch I found that when the
computer (via the throttle position switch) senses that the throttle is
closed, it maintains a constant throttle speed regardless of any
mechanical screw settings on the throttle body. With the switch unplugged
the engine idled too high. I was able to change the idle speed by turning
a bypass screw, located on a vertical axis on the left side of the
throttle body. You need a very small socket to adjust it.

There is another screw with a lock nut that an arm connected to the
throttle shaft rests on when the throttle is closed. I believe that its
purpose is to prevent the butterfly valve from wearing a groove in the
throttle body cylinder. I adjusted that screw with the engine off, to a
position where the throttle was fully closed but still resing on the end
of the screw.

After adjusting the the throttle stopper screw, you may want to adjust the
throttle position switch itself. Since the switch is on the bottom, you
have to take the throttle body right out of the car. You then set the
position of the switch so that it clicks exactly when the throttle is
fully closed, and not before.

While you've got the throttle body off the car, you'll want to clean out
the valve and cylinder. It get pretty grungy in there! You can also do the
cleaning without removing the throttle body. Just remove the rubber
manifold from the air filter side of the unit.

All of this advice is based entirely on my own limited experience. You may
want to have my assumptions varified or corrected by other memeber of the
list, or by a trained Porsche mechanic.

Good luck!

Lance,
	The markings you describe on the head of the bolts are more than
	likely as follows:
	Excerpts from Bossard International Inc. catalogue, a major
	supplier of metric hardware.

		B  88  TR 
		The 88 is the metric property class 8.8, look closely, you
		may see a "." between the 8s (decimal point).

		"TR" is the manufacturers Identification symbol.

		The "B" may be the ISO Product Grade, a size tolerance standard
		but it is not shown in the catalogue as a std. head mark feature		Also, "Product grade B applies to the sizes above M24 and all 
		sizes with lengths greater than 10X diameters or 150 mm, 
		whichever is shorter." quote from Bossard. So that doesn't fit
		your case.

		Bossard shows no Material identifier with a "B".
		Stainless Steel have alpha-numeric codes as follows:
			A1, A2, A4, C1, C3, C4, F1. ... NO "B".

	My catalogue is from 1989, so there may be a new standard with a "B".
	Call your local screw supplier, Olander Corp. on West Coast or Tacoma
	Screw if you're in the Great NorthWest, and ask for help from them.

	Also need to know more about the application:

		Thread Pitch? Washer under bolt head? Nut or into tapped hole?
		What material if Tapped hole? Washer under Nut?
		Assembled Dry or with lubricant? What lubricant?

	These all make a difference as to the tourque to be applied because
	they affect the coeficient of friction under the bolt/nut head and in 
	the threads! Friction, reduces the amount of tourque the bolt sees!

	Does this bolt have a reduced body diameter?

	A 8.8 grade bolt is not a very high strength bolt, slightly lower than
	an SAE Grade 5. Tensile Strength of 800 MPa (N/mm^2), Material Spec of
	an equivalent to AISI 1035 or 1038 Carbon Steel, Quenched and Tempered

	Good Luck, and keep us posted as to the outcome!

Subject: Porting 914 2.0 heads.

  Hi gang.
I got heads that need work, and while in the vicinity...porting.
I've heard of polishing and/or enlarging, but a new one on me is
removing material from the guide around the valve stems to improve 
flow.  Ok, seems simple enough.  What are the negatives in doing so?
What other mods are within sanity?

Seems to me that removing anything from the valve guide might shorten
the life of the valve or guide.

I would like to see some debate here rather than STAN towing the line 
all alone.  I know there are other folks out there racing their 914's
with warmed over engines.  Surely they have something to say...

Subject: 911 missing

No, no, I don't mean that it's gone.  (I'm not that lucky!)

I am having what appears to be an electrical system problem with my
'76 911S 2.7.  It started a while back, initially just as an
occasional "blip" of the tachometer needle.  That is, the needle would
suddenly drop towards zero, immediately rebound, swing wildy back and
forth for a second and eventually damp down to the current RPM
reading.  There was no discernable engine miss, skip or loss of power.

Lately the problem has gotten worse.  Now the needle will drop WAY
down, sometimes to zero.  Now there is sometimes an accompanying
hesitation and "cut out" of power.  On some trips this will happen a
lot, to the point where I am expecting the car to just quit any second
(though it hasn't so far).  But then the next time I start it up I can
drive my whole journey without seeing the needle jump once.

Also, the problem seems sensitive to RPM.  When it is acting up, it
acts up lots more at higher RPM (above 3000).  Upshifting so as to
bring engine speed back to around 2000 will quiet things down.

So, I am looking for advice on what to look for or test first.  I am
guessing that this is a fault on the primary side of the ignition
system.  I did a visual inspection, including the distributor cap and
rotor, and did manage to find a loose connection of a wire grounded to
the fan shroud, but that didn't affect the problem.  Of course, most
of the wires in my engine compartment follow difficult-to-reach,
friction-taped paths into the recesses of the compartment.  Thus, I'd
like to draw on the collected wisdom of the group to figure out where
to look first.

Thanks.

    Let the engine cool for about 12 hours.  Also, you may want to buy

    I agree...but then again, it's not that difficult to pull the engine.
    I have it down to about 30 minutes.


    BTW, while you're down there, you may want to re-torque the lower head
    bolts.  These will be accessible when you remove the valve covers.  
    The lower ones tend to loosen more easily than the uppers since they
    immersed in oil.  Your Haynes manual should have the specs.

    When you adjust the valves, you have to start with the #1 cylinder
    at TDC, then adjust the valves for #1.  Next, rotate the engine so
    that the distributor rotor is 90 deg past that for the #2 cylinder,
    then adjust #2, and so on...  WARNING:  do not shove a screwdriver
    into the fan to turn the engine!  (I have seen the result of this!)
    This malpractice breaks the blades off of the fan.  Instead, I put
    the car on jackstands so both rear wheels are off the ground, put
    a pile of 2x4s under one of the wheels to keep it locked in place,
    put the car in high gear, then turn the free rear wheel.  I found
    this to be much easier than any other method.  Also, I remove the
    plugs to relieve the compression.

camber and too much toe in.  I've tried to adjust it, but my efforts
are not resulting in much change.  Does anyone have any

I must have missed the first part of this conversation.  Anyway, I too

Where is the connection?  IS it a simple thing to fix?

Thanks for your help!  (in advance)
- -----------------------------------

There is a antanae RF-power amp box under the dash
just under the right (passengers) side lower windshield.
(I was repairing ? when I noticed it there)
The wiring harness that leads to the radio connector
has a power lead for the antanea amp.  This 
power lead neads to go to +12V when the radio is
on if you want to hear AM (distant FM too ?)

There is a lead from most decks that go high
when the radio is on.  By convention it
is orange and marked 'power antanea' but
a audio power amp signal wire will also work.

I would have to look at the schematic again to 
find the color code of the wire, but I remember the connector
it has about 6 or 8 wires.

it does take some diging around in the wiring behind 
radio/tape deck.

Just a quick note since I saw that Steve mentioned that Carlsen would
be getting the "first" 993 in the US in March. Too late. We saw the 
first at Daytona last week. Real pretty too: that new green (a-something)
with linen interior. Sticker right in the window and it's true: $59k.
It was a Brumos car and I wouldn't be surprised if it was Bob Snodgrass
who was driving it.

The 993 looks different in person - more different that the classic 911 
than the pictures would have you believe. It looks very agressive with 
those big rear fenders.

We saw it at the Hampton Inn, right near the track, where the Brumos 
team was staying. I gotta picture of it on one of those rolls...

In this case, the head, not the valve or guide, is the first to go...
Same reasons you shouldn't put on the "double spring" valve springs --
cutting significantly into the lower valve guide support weakens
the material to the point that the whole assembly (valve, guide, and 
metal of head holding same) start to "wiggle". If you have any stress 
risers, which is almost a given, you get cracks and eventual drop
out of the guide.

The same thing happens at the other end if you do the dreaded 
double spring conversion. You *must* cut the valve guide boss
to clearance the inner spring, which causes the same thing to happen 
from above. (BTW, FAT sells a very good heavy duty single spring
which you can shim if you need more seat pressure).

Make anyone who claims to give you higher flow prove it on the flow bench.
And first, do the math and prove to yourself that you *NEED* the higher
flow, remembering that in low RPM cases, you want higher *VELOCITY*
instead. Also, remember that you have other intake restrictions which
may make the higher flow of the head moot.

For full-race ITA 2.0 heads, we *MAY* clean up the casting of the
intake port, and polish the exhaust port (slightly rough surface is
good for intake ports - *SLIGHTLY* *ROUGH*, not ragged, not polished).
We always do a venturi valve job, including polishing the valve tulip.
And other than CC'ing the head and dye checking for cracks, that's
about it. And that's good for up to about 7200 RPM, with more-or-less
stock EFI.

For full-race EP heads, we do all that, plus bigger valves, a slight
re-contour of the intake port, and flycutting to give specific
compression and combustion characteristics (what? tell *ALL* the
secrets... yeah, right...). This is used for up to 10,000 RPM
on a 1.8 liter engine.

Note that we *DO NOT* automaticly make any of the ports bigger -- key
thing is to keep your air flow at the right velocity in your
"active" RPM range, and to have enough flow to "work" given your
filling efficiency and max RPM. By and large, the 2.0 heads are
good enough for anything you're likely to use on the street, as is.
The 1.8 heads need *some* work, and the 1.7 heads make *GREAT* door stops...

From: tilden@kea.Data-IO.COM (John Tilden)
Subject: RE: 951/Brembo Brake Problem

Lance,
	Regarding the bolts, and torques.
	As stated in previous posting, IF these are M12 8.8 class bolts,
	Then they have a tensile strength of 800MPa or 116,030 psi.
	We can calculate the breaking strength of these bolts, as well 
	as the yeild strength, and the tourques to achieve these values.

	To give us a better feel for the safety of the following calculations,
	let's discuss the tightening process.
	During the tightening process, (Tourquing) you are appliing two
	distinct stresses to the bolt. 
		1) The tensile stress, resulting from the clamping load.
		2) The tourque stress, resulting from twisting the bolt.
	These stress are geometrically additive, so that while tourquing 
	the bolt you are appliing more stress to the bolt than it will
	see after you are done. The torsional stresses relax after a short
	time period in use, according to Shigely, a well known machine design
	text.
	So, according to Shigely "... if a bolt does not fail during 
		tightening, there is good reason to believe that it will
		never fail."

	Bolts are rated in:
		Proof Load, the maximum tensile load a bolt can withstand 
		without incurring permanent set, in this case 53.95 kN or
		12,128 lbs.

		Tensile Load, The breaking strength, point at which the bolt
		will fail, in this case 676.44 kN or 15,160 lbs.

	Tourques are easily calculated knowing the above, and the coeficient
	of friction under the bolt head.
	My Bossard catalogue suggests using .14, Shigely uses .20 as the 
	coeficient of friction.

	So we can calculate a range of tourques which will give us an idea
	of what is safe.

	From Bossard Catalogue: (k=.14)
		M12 fine pitch (1.25 mm)   76 Nm or 56 ft lb   (.7376 ftlb/Nm)
		M12 coarse pitch (1.75mm)  89 Nm or 65 ft lb *

	Calculated: 
		Torque to yield	(k=.20)	            95 ft lb
				(k=.14)		    66 ft lb *

		Torque to fail	(k=.20)		   119 ft lb
				(k=.14)		    84 ft lb

	Note that there is correlation between Bossard and Shigely for the
	same coeficient k=.14, this gives us a degree of confidence! (*)

	Shigely reccomends useing 90% of Proof Load (Yeild Strength), if
	you want to go with this, reduce the above torques by multipliing
	by .90.

	SO, What torque to use?
	I'd use, as a minimum value, that reccommended by Bossard 65 or 56 ftlbs
	dependant on thread pitch.
	I'd use a maximum of (65 + 84)/2 =74.5 ft lbs, halfway between the
	yield point and the breaking point, being conservative, useing the
	lower values dervived from the lower coef. of friction.

	Remember, if you don't break the bolt while tightening, it is 
	unlikely that it will ever break! If you want to tourque it higher,
	it's probably OK if it doesn't break!

	You could test the breaking strength of several bolts in your system,
	buy several (5 min.) extra bolts at $1.00 to $2.00 each, tourque them 
	up 'till they break, noting the tourque, this is obviously the upper 
	limit, and tourque them to the average of your experimental breaking 
	touque and the reccomended minimum tourque. Yes you will need an easy 
	out to remove them, but they are relatively soft bolts, and after they
	break they have no load on them, so they will come out easiliy. Use 
	lots of oil.

	The idea of loading a bolt into its yield region is to get higher
	clamping forces.
	In a properly designed bolted system, with no gaskets, bolts are 
	loaded in a static conditon, even if the load is varying, the 
	bolt will see a constant load until the bolted joint opens up.
	So it is safe to load the bolt into the yield region, since it is
	not subject to fatigue failure.

	You can calculate the forces the bolts will see knowing the size
	of the pistons, and the maximum system pressure and the caliper
	geometry. Then you may have a better feel for the safety of the
	replacement bolts, and what touques to use. Obviously, you
	don't want the calipers to open up during use.

	NOTICE TO ALL:
	Please use this information carefully, as you are dealing with
	a major safety system, and YOUR LIFE is on the line! YOU must 
	take responsibility for any consequences that may result from
	using the above information. Sorry, but I don't take responsibiltiy
	for anyone's actions or application of the above commonly known 
	engineering principles. Obviously, Brembo doesn't either!

I'm trying to find a buyer for my running, but likely pulled head studs,
and oil leaking, but still strong running 2.7 original engine, with 127K
miles on it.  Partshaven has offered $400, I am trying to get an offer
from EZ-wreckers in Emeryville.  I have 510-563-EASY for their #, but am
getting a wrong number recording?

Thanks for any opinions on what I should sell this for.  Thanks.

Steve,

Not knowing what you're garage floor is made of, I would probably suggest
just keeping a fan on it to disperse whatever comes up for as long as it
does.  I know that speedy-dry gets used at tracks, and portland cement is
supposed to work well for the same application.  But I don't know whether
they work as well for lightweight fluids as they do for oil and coolant.

Charles,

The tire width (eg, 245) is a measure of the tire's (approximate) section
width, and not its tread width or bead (rim) width.  Tire manufacturers
provide a chart listing acceptable rim widths for any given tire.  There's
usually a fair amount of flexibility, assuming you're willing to accept
a slightly sub-optimal sidewall orientation.

Get the latest version of the part from your dealer, and don't skimp on
replacement interval.  I'm not sure what Porsche recommends, I think its
something like 30K retension and 45K replacement.  I would replace at
no more than 25K miles.

I am told that there is a non-OEM belt for the eight-valvers sold in the
aftermarket which is OK.  I forget the maker, but the shop I hang around
buys them from Derentz.  They have never had a problem with one.

Buying the part from Porsche gives you somebody to, um, talk to if it
breaks unexpectedly.

Stef:

I had the exact same problem last year.  I was trying
to install a 911S front on my 914/6. Well, those are
not rubber O-rings. Brake fluid will swell them up in
no time, I tried. I bought my calipers used, they didn't 
come with the O-rings.  I spoke with Bruce Anderson and
people in Stoddard (where I bought the rebuild kits) with
no luck. They know about the O-rings, but don't know where 
to buy new ones.

It turns out that there are 2 sizes.  I bought 2 used O-rings
from a local PCA member that had a few in his parts box. 
I also replaced the four allens (cap screws) with new one
from Wurth. They are strong stuff, 10.9 or 11.9.

Let me try to dig up the local PCA member's number and see if
he has any more O-rings.  I think he only had one size.

PS -you can buy stainless pistons for those calipers. Usually
    the chrome plating doesn't hold up. 
    I have also converted to vented discs in the rear. I can provide

Maidenform? Victoria's Secret? Bali?? Maybe a little light fiberfill,

Seriously, there seem to be several good bras out there, and the key
to whether on will work for you or not seems to be what you want to
do with it. All of the major aftermarket guys sell at least one brand,
and there are lots of ads in Pano and Excellence for others...

Oh, but be advised that most PCA groups won't let you on track
at a drivers ed event or time trial with a bra, since most are only
rated to something below 100 MPH. Just in case that's what you want
to use it for...

BTW, one of my pet peaves: I'd love to find a bra for my 911/914/356

Like many of you, I caught the two-hour coverage of last week's event
as broadcast last night on ESPN.  I was surprised to see the 59 car fall
victim to not one but two fan belt failures.  Does anyone know *why*
they lost two?  Seems kind of bizarre.

For those of you who missed the broadcast, I'd say you didn't miss too
much.  Except for highlights of a multi-hour dual for the lead in GTU,
the broadcast showed very little in the way of car-to-car competition.
Of course, it's nice to see Porsches competitive, let alone dominating.
I'll bet the energy was a bit different if you were there; too bad the

Subject: Advice on a 1977 911S

I'm new to e-mail and new to Porsches...but here's my situation, I have 
an uncle in Calif. who has a friend who has a 1977 911S Targa that he'll
sell for $5000.  My uncle owns two 911's (years unknown), and has owned
a couple others and a 912, so he's not exactly a novice to Porsches, like
me.  He says it's in good shape with 50,000 miles on a re-built engine
where the case was replaced.  The engine has the stock exhaust system 
replaced with headers to make it run cooler (no, I don't know how it 
passes Calif. smog).

Now I've heard some horror stories about '75-'77 911S engines.  About
overheating due to the smog/exhaust systems and how this amplifies some
problems with engine stud designs.  Here are my questions:

1. How bad is the '75-'77 911S engine?  I'm not too interested in buying
   the car for $5k and then immediately spending another $5k on rebuilding
   it.  What is the expected mean time between rebuilds?  Can a case 
   replacement solve the design flaws in the engine stud design?

2. Does anyone know if this car, assuming the emission levels are OK, will
   have a chance at passing Colorado emission tests?

3. Any advice to a novice on this deal?

Thanks,

The best bras in my opinion are made by Colgan.  They fit well, have 
all the anti-lift tricks, and can be custom-ordered as to holes for 
license plate, foglight, headlight washers, etc.  They average about US$90-120.

Subject: 914: Valve adjusting fool

(I hope this doesn't show up twice. It bounced back the first time.)

Hi there!

I suppose I'd better ask this before I break something.

Well I'm up to my armpits in suspension parts working on adjusting my
valves.  As you recall there seemed to be a lot of 'tappit' noise coming
from one side of the engine. So the assumption was that a couple of the
valves must needed some adjusting. When I put the engine where TDC
should be for the two cylinders in question (#3 & 4) the adjustment
seems to be pretty good. But when I keep rotating the engine and get it
to where it's on the exhaust stroke (for example) then the intake valve
could use a bit of adjusting (they are a bit loose). And vice-versa.

Is making the measurement at other than TDC for a cylinder OK? I would
sorta vote yes since I already find it odd that they want you to make a
six-thousandths of an inch adjustment after 'eye-balling' where TDC
should be (for all of the cylinders except #1).

If it looks like the adjustment is OK what else might cause all of the
noise? And do I really want to know? :-| Nothing feels loose (like the
rocker arms).

Thanks!
Bob

Subject: Re: 24 Hours of Daytona

Kevin (and other porschephiles):

I was at Daytona from Thursday thru the end of the race on Sunday.  Based  
on talking with people from the Brumos crew and Bruce Anderson, who  
discussed the problem with the mechanics, the Brumos Porsche 911 Turbo  
(#59) fell victim to a small oil leak.  This caused the fan belts to  
become soaked with oil and slip and eventually fail.  The crew would spray  
down the belt with brake clean at every stop, but apparently this band-aid  
didn't prevent the problem from eventually toasting the engine.

They changed the turbo after the engine starting smoking, basically in a  
small hope that the turbo was the only problem, but obviously the engine  
had overheated enough to cause irreparable damage.

That type of problem is a pretty serious black mark on Andial's  
reputation.  This confirms the rumours that Andial's engine-building  
department has gone seriously downhill now that Alwin Springer is no  
longer intimately involved.

Stuck and Rohrl specifically were awesomely fast before the failure,  
especially when you realize that at several points in the race they were  
beating both Nissan GTS cars, which are incredibly sophisticated  
purpose-built race cars.  It was pretty clear that the Brumos car had full  
factory support, just by the crew personnel and PAG faces at the race.

Subject: Re: Bra for '85 928S4

My two bits.  Tried the Colgan for my 944, switched to the "factory" part,
preferred it.  Dunno about 928's.

But more importantly, regarding cut-outs.  I've made a bunch of changes,
if you can imagine such a thing, to my bra.  The first was stitching a
small panel across the license plate cut-out.  Piece of cake, assuming
you have some spare material.  I've then added cut-outs for brake cooling
duct inlets.

Then removed the centre mesh and added an extra "cross member" to keep
the thing together.  All these changes were very easy, and with the
extra material and edging from a donor bra, look fine.

I've had no high-speed track problems with the thing, and up here in the
Northeast I don't know any region which disallows bras at the track.  I
would never run my personal car at Bridgehampton *without* a bra.  (The
race car is another matter!)

However, I would point out that removing the mesh over the radiator/
induction area was good for as much as 20 degrees F in oil temp.  In
a series of highly scientific, double-blind tests audited by Coopers
Lybrand, I ran my car at different tracks last year with and without the
bra (same day), and those were the temp differences I saw.

Mike,
  My '77 911S has the original engine, and 127K on it, but is leaking bad,
and will be replaced this week with a 3.0.  One other netter has told me
he's also gotten 150K or so out of his stock 2.7 without rebuilding, but
according to many here, and Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance book, many of
the 2.7 engines need top end rebuilds at 30-60K when new, if rebuilt
correctly, then maybe they can go for longer, but the magnesium case, and
original valve designs inherently made them unreliable.

I think $5,000 is a good price, if the compression is good, and the engine
is not leaking.  Also, Partsheaven and I presume other places sell 2.7
rebuilt engines for $2,500.

Supposedly, the '77 2.7 can pass CA smog through the pipe without the pump
hooked up, but obviously won't pass visual inspection without everything
hooked up.

Good luck.

Ted

Hello fellow porsche lovers,

Before the year is out I would like to purchase my very first porsche.
The flavour's I like the best are the 944 and 928 models.  Well the 
reason Im writting this is that I need advice on thesE fantastic cars.
I have no knowledge in these make of cars so Im asking all 944 or 928
owners for a little help.

I cannot afford to buy the latest models, so Im looking for either;

1:  1980-1984 model 928 or

2:  1985/86  model 944.

If anybody would like to share their thoughts on these cars I would 
be interested in hearing about it.  Also what should I be looking for
in these cars.  Are there any faults or defects(God I hope not), 
mechanical problems that I should be looking for, upgrades, extra's
etc...

If Im not mistaken I believe there may be a FAQ or an archive
that I could look at to get the answers to my questions.  If anybody
could direct me to this I would be very greatful.

Well thankyou for reading this and I look forward to any replies.

Subject: 944S2 hose from alternator?

I was doing some routine under-the-car maintenance on my 944S2 and I saw an
air hose dangling freely a few inches from the plastic housing to which it
belonged. I reconnected the hose and tightened the hose clamp. 

End of story, except that I am very curious. What is this hose? I looked in
the engine compartment and saw that it goes to the alternator. My guess is
that this hose brings fresh air from the nose of the car to the alternator.
Is this correct? Why does the alternator need fresh air?

Thanks

Subject: request for 911 advice 

I am in the last stages of deciding whether or not to purchase a '71
911E. I am asking the list for any advice/comments.

The car:1971 911E; professionally appraised at my expense

	complete records from 1986 on

	suspension conversion to torrsion 1986, done right

	quit origonal...no upgrades/changes except for the stereo

	rust free, California car from day 1 until now; correct title

	engine compartment is clean, exhaust/heat exch. are good,
	engine top is clean and dry but appraiser noticed minor seepage
	underneath on the right side (just a few drops he said)

	starts and idles well, runs strong; oil press. 20 at idle, 60
	when you get on it; origonal mech. fuel injection (works well)

	engine is quiet; was resealed in 88; new chain tensioner in 89
	(type not know at this time)

	clutch/transmission (5 sp.) drive well, brakes work well

	except for new correct headliner, the interior is origonal and
	in very good condition

	correct 14 inch alloy wheels

	everything works (including power sunroof) except....see below

BUT: black paint (older, average job) over origonal orange, AND the
odometer quit at 44K miles. Repair records indicate the odometer died
in 1986. The owner estimates mileage at 100K plus... but who knows.. he
has owned it for 18 months.

I'm interested in acquiring a pre-1974 911 to pamper and enjoy on the
weekends in fair weather (no rain and certainly no snow/winter driving)
for 2K to 3K miles per year. I would like to drive the car as is for a
decade and then consider a complete restoration. I want a car to
drive...not to look at. I do not view owning a 911 as an investment but
clearly I am investing $$ in the car.

The asking price is $10.5K. I would have to spend another $1K to get
the car transported to St. Louis. The appraiser says "this is a very
nice 911".

Assuming proper maintenance and no abuse in the past...how long can one
expect the 2.0 liter '71 engine to last?

Does the loss of mileage recording severely devalue a 911 of this
vintage?

What about the paint?  I don't appreciate the orange color...what does
a paint over do to the value of a 911? Was black a factory color in
1971?

Thanks in advance for reading this and for replying if you choose to
spend the time to do so.

I can corroborate this story. I saw the car driving around in the

definitely a Brumos' car, it was parked at their garage most of the

I agree, very aggressive, but it's perfect; not gaudy like a Countach.

The hose is for cooling.  Alternators get hot, what with the engine

How'd you get the hose back on?  I removed mine a year ago, and 
*cannot* get it back on without pulling the top half of the dang engine!

I would like to suggest a 1987/1988 924S as a cost-effective alternative 
to the 944. I own a '88 924S which has proven itself as every bit a 
Porsche at a somewhat lower price. Porsche introduced the 924S as a lower 
cost (about US$5000 when new) alternative to the 944. Today, you can 
probably get a 87/88 924S for the cost of a 85/86 944. 

Whoops. One catch, as I notice from the writer's email address indicates 
that he is from Australia: I don't know if the 924S was made with the 
steering wheel on the right hand side or if it was ever exported to 
Australia. Anybody know ?

The 924S is basically a 944 with the older 924 body. Which body style is 
more desirable is a matter of taste - I have had several people tell me 
they prefer the 924 body to the more aggressive looks of the 944. The 
engine and drivetrain are all 944 components. In fact, because of the 
better aerodynamics of the 924S, gas mileage, zero-to-sixty and top speed 
specs beat those of the same model year 944. On the other hand, the 924S 
has somewhat skinnier wheels/tires which reduces handling at the limit.

Things to look out for are the same as for the 944:
1) Timing belt should have been replaced at 30-40 thousand miles.
2) Water pumps are notoriously bad (mine replaced at 40,000)
3) Motor mounts are suspect (mine still O.K. at 45,000)

Based on my car, also check that the odometer is still working and that 
the power window switches are all operative.

Other than the above, the 924S should prove a reliable and economical 
Porsche.

Subject: Advice on a 1977 911S

   Date:	Sun, 13 Feb 1994 13:16:21 -0800
   From:	Mike Kwan <kwan@col.hp.com>

   I'm new to e-mail and new to Porsches...but here's my situation, I have 
   an uncle in Calif. who has a friend who has a 1977 911S Targa that he'll
   sell for $5000.  My uncle owns two 911's (years unknown), and has owned
   a couple others and a 912, so he's not exactly a novice to Porsches, like
   me.  He says it's in good shape with 50,000 miles on a re-built engine
   where the case was replaced.  The engine has the stock exhaust system 
   replaced with headers to make it run cooler (no, I don't know how it 
   passes Calif. smog).

   Now I've heard some horror stories about '75-'77 911S engines.  About
   overheating due to the smog/exhaust systems and how this amplifies some
   problems with engine stud designs.  Here are my questions:

   1. How bad is the '75-'77 911S engine?  I'm not too interested in buying
      the car for $5k and then immediately spending another $5k on rebuilding
      it.  What is the expected mean time between rebuilds?  Can a case 
      replacement solve the design flaws in the engine stud design?

Well, I am one of the people currently losing big due to the
head-stud-pulling problem of this engine.  If you don't have absolute,
ironclad proof of an upgraded engine-case and/or studs, watch out.  As
I discovered, it is possible to "tighten up" such an engine so that,
at least temporarily, it doesn't obviosly leak oil or have bad
compression.  But you could still be looking at a complete rebuild a
little while down the road.

I'll leave it to others to quote you statistics on how long the 2.7L
engine will last before and after various rebuilds.  The reputation of
the next-generation 911SC engines is much better, which doesn't mean
that you can't lose.  Offhand, $5,000 seems a bit low if the engine
was really upgraded and the rest of the car is in good shape.  Is it?
Does the engine have the chain-tensioner upgrade?

   2. Does anyone know if this car, assuming the emission levels are OK, will
      have a chance at passing Colorado emission tests?

My car has passed the CA emission test even though it doesn't have the
thermal reactors.  Of course, you need to find a place that doesn't do
a very good job of checking for all the smog-related equipment, and
just reads the printout slip from the exhaust gas analyzer.  I found a
smog shop where the guy wasn't initially sure whether the engine was
in the front or the back, and decided that actually looking for the
EGR valve was too much trouble.

   3. Any advice to a novice on this deal?

What kind of documentation do you have on the rebuild?  You (or your
uncle) should have the car evaluated by a local mechanic before you
buy.  The members of this list can probably recommend a garage if you
tell us where the car is located.

I'd hate to be the one to foreclose your dreams of owning a Porsche,
but I also wouldn't wish my kind of Porsche nightmare on you.  Can you
afford to move up to a newer car?  Failing that, maybe you could look
for an earlier one, although it seems that good copies can be
expensive there too.

Good luck.

Subject: RE:914 valve adjust

Bob,
I get by with a small 2 inch screwdriver from Sears to do the
adjusting.  Of course, getting your hands up in there too may be a
problem.

One tip I picked up a few years ago helps speed up the process a
little.  After you get the crank set to TDC for piston #1 (there should be a 
zero showing in the timing window) you can set the
clearances for #1 Intake, #1 Exhaust, #2 Intake, #4 Exhaust.
Now turn the crank to TDC for piston #3.
Adjust #3 intake, #3 exhaust, #4intake, #2 exhaust.
It saves me a lot of time getting in and out from under the car, turning 
the crank etc...

If anyone knows of a drawback to this procedure please let me know.

I used a two piece Colgan bra on my 84 cab for a couple of years.  I never
had any problems with it at speed, even on those rare blasts up to 120mph.

Although I was neurotic about keeping the car clean I found that debris from
leaves, sand, and other grit always got under the hood "pocket" and over time
caused some abrasion damage to the paint.  A friend hardly ever takes his
Colgan off, even when it rains or to wash his car.  His hood is now two tone.

I would think twice about using one.  You might consider a one piece bra to
force yourself to take it off more often (to get under the hood).  Or are they
more likely to flap at high speed?

Subject: 944 rear wheel bearings

I recently purchased my first Porsche; an '84 944.

I am thoroughly stoked!  (that's EricSpeak for excited!)

I look forward to doing much, if not all, repair and maintenance work on the
car.  I also hope to autocross it.

Although the car has super low miles (25K), it has not been well cared for and
needs some minor mechanical work.  The first project will be replacing some bad
rear wheel bearings on the left side.  I have the Porsche service manuals and
the procedure looks straightforward with one notable exception.  I don't have
a hydraulic press, so I plan on employing a punch and ball-peen hammer to very
gently and evenly move the old bearings out and the new ones in.  I also will
be replacing the seals and checking the end play per the manual.

I suppose it could be done with the trailing arm (brain fade: is that the
correct term?) on the car, but I think it would be easier overall to remove
the trailing arm and do the work on a bench.  I will have the alignment
checked when I have it back together.

So, does the above plan sound OK?  Are there any caveats I should know about
beforehand?

TIA,

    Eric

Pressure Brake Bleeding:
Some time back I sent out mail about how to pressure bleed. Well I just did
it on my 79 SC and it works slick. And I didn't have to drag my wife down
to my workshop to pump up the pedal. 
All you do is: Find an old Ate master cylinder cap, mine is from a Volvo. 
Drill a hole for a fitting,Thread in the correct air fitting w/sealent. 
Plug the overflow tube on the side of the reservoir w/ screw. 
Dial on 15-20lbs pressure and go around and open the bleeders.

Wheel Polishing: 
I wanted to polish my 16" Fuchs, but everyone wanted big $. And I already
blew the wad on the engine and tranny. I called Wood in LA and they wanted
$150 a wheel + shipping. SO, I decided to do it myself.
1st I dismounted my tires, removed the weights, Prep-sol to remove wax, 
mount rim on car(I used the rear cuz my tranny is out)
get a BIG V belt from your lawn tractor, mount a old washing machine motor
to a block of steel. 2-3" pulley works good. And now you have a wheel polisher!
I mounted a garden hose to spray water on the rim as it turned. 
Now the factory Anodizing is real hard, so I found I had to start with 80 grit!
After you gert all the curb scraps and Anodizing off you work you way up to a
120 grit, then 220, 320, 400, 600, 1000, 1200, then I used the orange Dupont
rubbing compound, and then the white rubbing compound. I tried using a buffing
wheel as it rotated, but just holding a CLEAN rag with each step of compound
works great! Expect to spend 3Hrs per wheel.

Subject: Re: 944 rear wheel bearings

Eric,

Did the pre-85.5 have steel rear arms or aluminum?  On the cars with
aluminum ones, I recommend using a torch to heat the arm enough so that
the bearing will come out without excessive force.  This can be done
with the arm on the car, if the car is on a lift.  I suppose you could
get the job done on the ground, but I'd really hate to try.

Same technique may work fine for steel arms.  Having never tried it,
though, I can't promise.  Pressing the bearing out is ideal but most of
the time impractical.

Slime the outside of the new bearing with anti-seize before installing.

Subject: Error in 2.0l 911 Mahle P&c sets

If you  recently purchased a 911T 2.0l Piston & Cylinder Kit, it might
behoove you to check the piston to cylinder clearance. Three BRAND NEW MAHLE
sets at local Wholesalers have had 356SC/912 Cylinders with 911 Pistons.  
Although this is nice of Mahle to preserve the 356/912 line, it is perhaps
better to have  911 cylinders to go with 911 Pistons.  And since the
356SC/912 Cylinders have an 82.5mm bore whilst the 911 pistons have an 80mm
bore, one has with this combo a clearance of 2.5mm!!!  This is neither Right
nor Good, and should have been noticed by  any Quality Assurance guy with an
IQ greater than room temperature (in either F or C).  Unfortunately, this
itty-bitty error WASN'T noticed, though seeing an EIGHTH of an INCH clearance
between the Piston and cylinder should be Most Obvious to the Casual Observer
that SOMETHING IS WRONG! 

  Again, the three sets of 2.0l 911T Pistons were of a batch received in
October 1993. So there may be more out there just waiting for you.

What is most important when buying plug wires is that they are made of pure

are unnessary and can lead to other problems.

1.  An adequate quantity of pure copper plug wire with silicon insulation.  
2.  A new set of cigarillos (the insulators that attach to the spark plugs)
3.  Brass connectors that attach to the distributor end of the wires
4.  14 small neoprene dust covers
     - one for each end of the spark plug wires (12)  
     - one for each end of the coil wire (2)
Assembly:
1.  Cut your spark plug wires to length.
2.  Put a dust cover on one end of the wire, thread a cigarillo. 
3.  Put the dust cover on the other end of the wire, strip about 1.5 cm of
     insulation, bend the bare wire and clamp a brass connector on.  
4.  Plug it all together and (hopefully) vrrrom.

	Dunno about Oz, but all of Porsche's products have appeared in the
UK with the steering wheel on the right (!) side, even the 959.

	The 924S tends to be very good value here, as 944s are so cheap
that the 924S is very difficult to sell. We see a couple at PCGB meetings.

Subject: Porting 2.0 914 Heads

In regards to the message on the net
concerning removing valve guide material
around the valve stem - DON'T DO IT!!!!
This close relationship of valve guide/
valve stem is vital for the transfer of heat
away from the head of the valve.  In fact,
too much clearance between the valve stem and
guide are a sign of worn guides.  Worn guides,
if left unattended, can result in the head of
the valve breaking off and falling into the 
combustion chamber.  Needless to say, when this 
happens, it doesn't take long for an errant 
valve head to do alot of damage to your piston/
cylinder.

At any rate, I can't think of any flow related
performance gain you could achieve by doing this
anyway???

My two cents....

Subject: Bras

        I would like to concur with Lance.  I recently bought a two piece
bra for my 911 - as both of the roads that I can take to get to work are
under construction (it is cleaver how the planners always seem to do that)
and I wanted to protect the new paint from the hazards resident around
construction sites.  
        I had never bought a bra before, because back in my Air Force days
I knew that our buble canopies were never covered with their "bras" because
the dirt would scratch the canopy over time.  I take the bra off every time
it gets wet (per instructions), which is quite often in FLA, as any water
(e.g., a light shower during the day that I might not notice) gets trapped
against the paint and stays there for a long time unless you remove the bra
and dry it.  Everytime I do this there is always dirt between the bra and
the car.
        As a result, I clean & wax the area under the bra every time I take
it off to protect the paint from the thing that is supposed to be
protecting the paint.  But until the construction is finished I will
probably continue to use it.  
        After that I only paln to use it to fend off the acid from dead
love bugs twice a year.

Does your car has the aluminum or the steel trailing arms?
If you have the aluminum, you have to take the arm out and take it to the
dealer. It needs to be heated at a certain temperature before an attempt
of getting it out can be made. I have done this in a 87 951 model and I
can offer you my experiences.

Subject: 951/Brembo Brake Problem

While I was travelling to and racing at this year's first PCA Club Race on 
the Sebring long course, some well researched comments were made here on my 
question about the fasteners that hold together Brembo brake calipers. 
First I have to 'fess up. Not knowing any better at the time, I reassembled 
the caliper halves using the same bolts that came with them originally.  
These are the bolts that the Porsche service manual says NEVER reuse. As a 
torque value I used 63 ft.lbs. The reason is that these bolts (M12 coarse 
pitch) are the same size as those that hold the whole caliper to the 
spindle and the tech manual spec for that application is 63 ft lbs. After 
three PCA Club races and a couple of drivers ed events there's been no 
problem at all. Therefore Shigely's comment that "...if a bolt does not 
fail during tightening, there is a good reason to believe that it will 
never fail" applies here...at least so far.
However, I am obtaining  new 8.8 class bolts, including a few extra to 
torque to the failure point, and will replace the originals. Depending on 
the failure torque, I will probably use a higher value than 63 ft lbs to 
get a higher clamping force and come closer to what Brembo is doing in 
their OEM assembly.
The assembled wisdom of those that contribute to Porschephiles is most 
impressive. Many thanks to those that took the time to help me out.

I'm sure that what the writer was referring to was
optimizing the airflow around the point at which the
valveguide ends. There is a fairly blunt hunk of metal
there that *can* benefit from a little streamlining in
the hands of a flow bench expert. That's the real key.
Porsche heads and ports are already pretty good, and 
a die grinder in the hands of an amateur can hurt more
than help performance.

That said, if a person is looking for top-end, flat
out performance, it's a good idea to see that air moves
through the engine as efficiently a as possible. That
means smoothing ports, exactly matching port openings
for every mating surface etc.

Porting is a job for an expert, with Porsche experience.
If done moderately and correctly, it shouldn't effect the
life of the engine. The only time a really radical porting
job would be done is on a very high-revving racing engine
that would by it's nature have a limited life span.

One warning about porting -

It has a similar effect to making carburettor venturis
larger. At the extremes, you gain top-end speed at the
expense of low end responsiveness (where 99% of us drive)

Subject: Clear Plastic Auto Bra?

With regards to the recent discussions on nose bras
for Porsches: I recall seeing a model about five
years ago that was molded from clear impact-resistant
plastic.  Small rubber "dimples" strategically placed
on the inside surface of the bra let it sit on the
car's finish with minimal contact area.   I don't recall
how it it was afixed, but remember that it's selling
points were: its small and non-rubbing contact with the
car's finish; it was clear, so it's not obvious that
the car is bra'd; and the bra can be left on through
rain and shine.

In practice I imagine the plastic clouded and became
more brittle with the effects of temperature, road
chemicals and UV.  Anyone have experience with these
bras, or know if they're still offered?

I don't recall seeing Mr. Haywood, but I did see Mr. Supercar himself, Hans
Stuck, giving a very enthusiastic endorsement of the 993 during the ESPN
"coverage" of the Rolex 24 at Daytona.

If, as Jim Harriger suggests, the Brumos Porsche is based on a 964 chassis,
then I am sure that Stuck etal can't wait for next year's race car based on the
993 chassis.

It was also gratifying to see David Hobbs point out that the 911's had a very
respectable showing, using a production car chassis, against all of the
purpose-built, tube-framed cars.

Subject:      Winter Porsches/Pfile visitors...

Friends,
A while ago I stuck my tongue in my cheek and went off about how well
Porsche's deal with the winter driver :-/

An update:
I have had a recurring problem with the '81 $931$$$$, ever since I took
ownership of the thing. When the weather was _extremely_ cold, the car
was possessed. On the most memorable occasion, a trip from Rochester to
Buffalo and back, (which started out as an essential trip to Toronto and
back, but we ended up renting a car in Buffalo to finish the journey.),
the car just quit, and refused to run. After a few minutes wait, it started
up again and ran normally ... for a few miles :-(  THen behaved like it
was starving for fuel again eventually cutting out completely. Anyway,
we pulled this routine of going a few miles then sitting on the side of
the freeway waiting for the car to come back to life, in severely cold
weather, finally giving it up when we reached Buffalo. When we returned
to Buffalo in the wee hours of the morning, my wife and son were both sick,
and this trip from hell lasted well on into the early daylight hours before we
made it home to ROchester. Anyhow, over the years, I thought this problem
was a one off deal that I had "fixed" by generally straightening up
the air hoses, CIS components, filters etc. But still, every once in a while,
in extremely cold weather, the car would go whacky. After running normally
for a while, it would refuse to idle at the lights. If allowed to stall,
it wouldn't start. This required a certain amount of heel toe talent since
it was really squirrely at low RPM during one of these recalcitrant periods.
It would start up normally again after a few minutes of cool down period
and the problem would disappear. Usually it was too cold to spend much
time trying to diagnose the problem anyway. It was left as one of those
mysterious *features* that one learned to live with.

But HEY!! I found the problem!! And I bet it happens with other Porsches
as well!! Kelvin Ross came for a visit to the frozen north during one of
the coldest weeks we have had in years and I picked him up from the Toronto
airport. Kelvin unfortunately discovered the answer to that question of
just what happens when you get separated from your passport (another tale of
woe that sheds a very evil light on United Air Lines, along with Canadian
Immigration Officers. A long story that still needs to be publicly aired).
The short version is that we had to travel during the _COLDEST_ part of the
night after all the holdups satisfying red tape, and Guess What!?!
Journey from Hell part two is born! The car is a pig on wheels. At one
point we weaken and call the hook. When it gets there the beast starts and
runs. We're off again only to be foiled at a traffic light a few miles from
home. It is 25 degrees Celsius, below stinking zero! When we finally roll
in at 5 a.m. in a taxi. White Car from Hell is immobile and won't start the
next day either :-(
Inside a heated shop we discover The Reason!
I have never seen anything like this before! The air flow sensor is TOTALLY
encrusted in ice! It can't move at all! Hence the car would run, as long as the
RPM matched the fixed fuel flow provided. The air filter was encased as well.
I *think* it was able to find all that moisture by freezing all the
condensation from the crankcase vent. I have no better explanation. I think
the cure is to run a special air intake extension back closer to the engine
where it is warmer, for these severe temperatures. I don't want to think about
the harm to the engine caused by locking the sensor plate in one position :-(
Meanwhile, the air flow sensor has been renamed "The Ice cream machine" :-/

The moral:  If you are experiencing bizarre engine operation during extremely
cold weather that isn't explained by the usual air leakage, electrical
gremlins,... etc. type arguments, it just might be a froze up ice cream
machine. Once in the heated shop for a while, you don't find the problem.

Eric,

Congratulations on your purchase.  May it serve you well for 
many years.  p.s. for increased enjoyment, join the Porsche Club.

The rear wheel bearings on the 83-85/1 944s are indeed straightforward
to replace.  Having done my own last year, I recommend the hammer and
drift method.  Taking the trailing arm off the car is not recommended
unless absolutely necessary.

1) With wheel on ground, undo large (36mm) nut on end of axle stub.
2) Remove wheel, remove halfshaft
3) remove brake caliper, plugging brake line with bleeder valve cover.
4) remove brake rotor
5) remove outer bearing retainer (4 bolts, as I recall)
6) remove stub axle, feel for the inner bearing retaining gripclip.
7) remove gripclip.
8) At this point, you should be able to drift out the races.  There are
   recesses in the hub which are there for a drift.

9) Reassembly is left as an exercise for the student.

I was wondering if anyone has ever done this: Of course on SC's we
want to replace the wires with the grounded type to prevent crossfire
and possible damage to the airbox, fine. But can't you just purchase
the regular wires and thread them through the old ground braiding, after all
that doesn't wear out right? I've never done this but it seems like it
should work once you unscrew the connectors from the wires. I mean it
seems kinda wasteful to buy the whole ground braiding every time. Thoughts?

Just another possible money-saving thought for those thrifty 911

I use a colgan 2 piece bra on my 911 at track events to prevent chips from the stones
that get thrown from all those stickey tires just in front of me, as well as mirror
bras.  I take them off at the end of the weekend.  The colgan 2 piece fits very snuggly
and has not flapped at any speed I can reach.  I wash the hood and put a fresh coat of
wax on just before attaching the bra.

On previous cars I had problems when I left the bra on for long periods of time.
Sand and dirt would get trapped under the upper lip on the bra and then polish
a line in the paint where the  bra met the car.  Once this happened, the bra had
to stay on forever, since I did not want to repaint the hood and fenders.

I have not noticed any of the above problems with the colgan bra given its limited
use.

For the benefit of those who have not used this method, here is how it
works.  Place the end of the punch against the side edge of the bearing
outer race and tap lightly with the hammer.  Move the punch a
quarter or a third of the way aroung the circumference of the race and
tap again.  Repeat, rotating around the race, until the bearing is free.
You will only be moving the bearing perhaps a tenth of a mm at a time;
any more and you could bind the race in its seat.
You have to be careful not to nick the bearing seat and you need to
take your time, but it does work.

Subject: Bad seat mounts

Thanks to all for the advice on my rear wheel bearings.  Now, plowing on to
new territory.

I have a loose seat.  No, it is not an anatomical problem. ;-)

I cross threaded one of the seat mounting bolts. :-(
And in the process messed up the mounting recess so that the nut in
the recess now spins all the way around.  Sheesh.

And this comes just after fixing the opposite corner mount.  In that one,
the channel metal fatigued and broke away so that there was nothing to
retain the nut.  I cut a piece of sheet metal and sheet-metal-screwed
it down over the nut.  I will weld it when I get a welder.

This is on my '84 944.  I an wondering if other models/years used a similar
mounting method.  If so, then some of you may also have run into this
problem and perhaps could suggest a solution.

I will try to describe how this mounting system works.  The floor pan has
raised channels about 15mm high and perhaps 6cm across.  The seat
bolts to these channels at 4 points, two on each seat rail.  A special nut
is held captive at each mounting point.  There is no way to get at one of
these nuts without cutting the channel.  Here is a "crude ASCII drawing"TM
cross section:

   __________________
   |   __________   |
   |     |    |     |      <--- nut inside channel
   |     ------     |
- -------------------------- <--- floor

If the nut was simply cross-threaded, I would run a tap through it and then
carefully thread in the bolt.  Unfortunately, the nut spins, so more
drastic measures are called for.  I can't think of anything other than
cutting the channel open and replacing the nut.  Maybe this is the time
to buy a MIG welder...

If anyone has a suggestion other than the brute force method I envision,
please give a shout.

And, you may wonder, just why have I been pulling the drivers seat out with
regularity?  I have been chasing electrical gremlins, spending time on my
back looking up under the dash.  Gosh there are a lot of wires jammed in
under there!!!

BTW, despite these little problems, I like the car a lot.  And I am learning
a *lot* about the car, which is the way I prefer it.

Thanks again and happy motoring,

    Eric

Chris,

If the noise only occurs in second gear, the problem is very likely
due to something specifically wrong with that part of the transmission.
A whining noise suggests that perhaps something is wrong with second

with the gearset proper, such as a chipped tooth.

Bevel in, to match the radius in the cam.  The cam, like many other parts,

This is option code M018, and is available world-wide.  Your local

Going around the edge with a punch and hammer won't work on an alum. arm,

Anti-seize is a mixture of lubricant and metallic particles which keeps

I don't know much about these cars cooled with foreign substances, however I
would recommend that you get some back issues of Excellence Magazine. Bruce
Anderson recently wrote a series of articles decribing the pro and cons of
used Porsches at various price points. The issues were:
Jun 1992- "What can you buy for $12000" (early 911, early 928, early 944)
Aug 1992- "What can you buy for $18000" (356, 911SC, 944 Turbo, 928)
Dec 1992- "What can you buy for $24000" (930, 944 Turbo S, 944S2, Carrera)
 
In the States, cost of the issues are $5.00 each. Not sure what shipping
would be to you. Excellence Magazines address is PO Box 1529, Ross,
California, 94957. Phone is 415-382-0580. Good luck!

i had one for a while.  it was attached via the license plate mount,
with the "non-rubbing" contacts around the sides of the car's nose.

same story as other bras when your car gets dirty/wet.  dirt under
the pads turns them into little sand blocks, and it takes a lot of
polishing to make the spots go away.  so you take it off more than
you'd think at purchase time.

the headlight cutouts also made them vulnerable to stone chips, though
what parts were protected were WELL protected.

i used to think bras were stupid, too.  then i discovered stone chips.

Again my numbers differ but it is in the noise - you do have an
order of magnatude error in one of your metric numbers - these
numbers are the load required to produce a specific stress in a

The equation is T=K*Fi*D
	where K is the fudge factor (.14 to .2 above)
dimensionless. Fi is the desired load in the bolt or screw - the
proof and tensile loads above in lb. D is the diameter of the
bolt in in. the result is torque in in-lb divide by 12 for
ft-lb.

Be careful with this, preload scatter using a dial or click
wrench is +-60%.  This is the reason for torqueing to yield this

torque-turn tools which monitor both torque and nut turn, these

Bingo.  
In another message the original poster said they reassembled the
brakes with the original bolts, and are ordering new 8.8 bolts. 
Given the uncertanties outlined above You should think about
going to the next stronger bolt and not worry about yielding
that bolt (metric 10.9).  I wont get into what the bolt is
threading into and what the problems could be there.

BTW formally it is known as a screw not a bolt because you are
turning the fastener on a bolt you turn the nut.  Hey i don't

I do not believe that the grounding is necessary; airbox damage was 
thought to be caused by plug wires, but didn't abate when they were 
used.

I don't believe the crossfire theorey at all [I can be educated if 
someone has some real evidence].

Are you also considering re-using the plug connectors?  If so, check the
impedance.  I believe that something like 1k - 2k ohms is the spec.

When I checked my old ones, some were around 1k, some around 1meg and
some were OPEN: "whole lot of arcin' goin' on."

I bought shielded wires from Vertex for $159.

Oh yeah, putting new wires in old shielding sounds "theoretically 
possible."  Also reminds me of putting toothpaste back into the tube.

Subject: Re: Bras

Here's my two cents:

Bought my 951 new in '87. Drove it almost daily in Massachusetts for a couple
of years (for about 30,000 miles). Never used a bra. Car was exposed to daily
blasts of 120 MPH sand and grit even on paved roads (US Route 1: my car @
60MPH + opposite direction trucks @ 60MPH).

Now living in Vermont, car comes out only in summer, but does get driven at
high speed driver's ed events several times a year. I use a bra at the track
(although it couldn't save my windshield from a rock in the esses at the
Glen!).

The summary: now that the car is used mainly for events in the company of
other Porschephiles, I'm feeling embarrassed enough about the "nose rash" to
plan to have the car re-painted forward of the doors if I can get comfortable
enough with somebody's paint color matching skills (recommendations
welcomed!).

Soooo... I wish I had taken the trouble to use a bra religiously before the
damage was done.

This morning I replaced the distributor cap and rotor, and cleaned the
points (eschewing the scientific method, I did all three at once) and
the problem seems to have gone away.  I feel a bit foolish for not
taking these simple steps before bothering the group, but I haven't
quite overcome that sense of "Porsche mystique" that makes me think
that everything is going to be complicated or obscure, and I'd better
get help before even starting.

Having said that, I have a question about something complicated or
obscure: what is the deal with the distributor rotor on this car ('76
911S)?  The rotor that was on the car was just a plain old rotor, like
the one I used to have on my first car, a (blush) '72 Pinto (except in
the nice Bosch orange color).  The new one that I picked up from
Automotion is this hairy spring-loaded affair.  I assume that the new
one is correct, but what does the spring do?  Was I losing because my
mechanic put in the wrong rotor at an earlier service?

Anyway, thanks for all the useful hints and suggestions I got.  I will
file them away for future reference.

I went shopping for a Halon fire extinguisher for the car the other

(I'd give the capacities if I had found them on the packaging.)

Would the little one suffice in case of an engine fire, or should I
spring for the more expensive one? I've never had to use any kind

each size will spray for.

Subject: Sebring PCA Club Race

To all interested Philes,
	I've been asked about this past weekend's PCA Club Race. Since this 
is my favorite Porsche activity, I will make a few comments
	First, the facts. We ran the long course at Sebring which consists 
of 17 turns over 3.7 miles. There were 100 entries (that was the limit - 
the event was "sold out" in Dec.) divided into 3 run groups. The actual 
races on Sun were 10 laps long. The weather was beautiful - partly cloudy 
in the high 80s each day.
	I did five of these races in '93 and my impression is that these 
are becoming serious as well as fun. There were a number of entrants that 
came in tractor/trailer rigs, over half came in enclosed trailers and very 
few drove their cars to the track. BFGoodrich has become involved and sent 
their Team T/A rig. They will be coming to all the east and midwest events 
in '94.
	Some very impressive cars made the grid. Fastest was clearly Martin 
Snow's "home built" 934. Beautifully prepared in full Martini livery. 
Martin's a hell of a driver too. There were entries from all over. We had 6 
cars from the Chicago Region and there were a few from Utah.
	There  were very few Incidents - Club Racingspeak for bent cars. No 
injuries at all unless you count sunburn.
	Yours truly in his E stock '89 951 had mixed results. There were 11 
cars in this class and although I had the fastest race lap in my class 
(84.68 mph) I finished 4th. This was due to a mediocre grid position (hey, 
this is a tough course to learn in a couple 30 min practice sessions) and 
my inability to pass one particular car intent on blocking me.  In spite of 
this, literally digging my trailer out of a snowbank at home and having to 
tow 1300 miles to get to this track were worth it. I can hardly wait for 
the next race at Road Atlanta in April. BTW, my Brembo calipers stayed 
together.
	Recommendation: Try Club Racing!

Automotion supplied you with the stock RPM limited rotor.   

From their liability standpoint it was the prudent thing to do. 

The rotor has a spring loaded weight that shorts out the spark at
say ~6500rpm.

I've seen advertised aftermarket electronic devices that do the same thing.
Some of these devices have a slow cut-in by shorting every other spark as
you approach the limit.  Properly designed, the electronic devices should
be more consistent since they are not depending on a spring or a sliding weight.

Probably later model Motronic ECU's incorporate RPM limiting.

But..

I've used the Bosch 04033 (stock VW bug) rotors for about 180k miles 
with no problems in 4 different 911's.  This is ~30 rotors.  

The 04033 doesn't have the rev limiting feature, but it's cheap. 

Here's an argument for why this is a reasonable substitution for a daily
driver car.  Those that race their cars may think otherwise.

The rev limiter will only save the engine if you overrev in neutral, or with
the clutch out or on acceleration in a gear.  With the tach directly in front
of the driver and the normal 911 high rpm engine noise, the driver is likely to 
know over-rev is imminent.

The two stories I've heard of damaging a 911 engine by over-reving involved
downshifting to the wrong gear.  

If the driver completes a downshift into too low a gear, the car's momentum can 
still over-rev an engine with a rev-limiting rotor since the rear wheels
are driving the engine in gear.  A shorted spark won't be of much help in
slowing the car.

An unadvertised feature of worn first/second gear synchros in the 901/911/915
transmissions is fairly positive prevention of downshift over-revs.

I t hink it depends on what you use the car for.  If I were going to drive the
car hard like in autox or on the track, I would spring for the bigger one. 
That would be sure to cover your needs, and you might be able to help someone
else if needed.  Also, if you are going to drive in autox or track driving
schools, you would want to check on their requirements for tech.  I am not sure
all schools will allow one of the smaller extinguishers.

You should be careful here.  A set of conductors which measure 1
Kohm, 1 Mohm, and open to a 1 V DC ohmmeter might look a whole lot
different to a 20 KV pulse having a rise time of a few
microseconds.

Nevertheless, I've been thinking about replacing my plug wires as

necessary to shield the wires used on my car.

On an '80 911, the upfixin procedure works, at least I have clearance
to swing out the strut.

Replacing a strut insert on a 911 is easier than on any other car I've 
encountered.

The top of the strut bolts to a "plate" that bolts to the chasis.  The
allignment is set by moving the "plate."  If you don't move the "plate,"
the allignment should not change.

You will have to compress the strut (by hand, not too hard) before it
will clear the fender.

Both are incorrect. I have done this myself and believe me it is doable without 
any of that pivoting stuff. But let me caution you that you need an impact 
wrench to remove the top nut of the shocks.

Here is how:

1. Jack the car up and remove wheels
2. Use impact wrench, remove top nut on the shocks (you are working under the 
   hood)
3. Remove the top plate that holds the shock to the top of the shock tower.
4. Collapse the shock and remove the bottom plate that holds the top of the
   shock to the shock tower.
5. Pull the shock out through the opening in the shock tower. If this is the 
   original shocks, be creative and be prepared to have hydraulic oil all over 
   your garage floor.
6. Insert the new one piece strut unit into the bottom housing of the shock. Be 
   prepared to collect a lot of hydraulic fluid.
7. Reverse process. 

8. you'll need creativity, luck, and a good neighbor with a air wrench. It took 
me 8 hours without an air wrench because the top nut kept rotating and I had to 
finally hack it off. it was not pretty.I would not do this again without an 
impact wrench.

Good luck

The "springy thing" in the distributor rotor on
the '76 911S engine is a rev limiter.  They come in
different rev limits which, I believe, are varied
as a function of the spring rate(the faster the
rotor spins, the more the spring elongates until
it shorts out against the little post at the end).

This "rev limiter" rotor is the correct one for
this vintage of car to the best of my knowledge.

Subject: Cat. convert question


You can check the cat with a vacuum gage. If the vacuum goes steadily
down from say 17" to 5" before the car dies then it sounds like a bad
cat. The cat is blocked and is developing high pressure in the exhaust
system before the cat and thus reducing the overall breathing capacity
of the engine.

A bad cat usuually means the elements inside are melted or broken
apart which causes blockage (also you can tap the cat and listen for
pebble-like rattling which indicates broken element).You have 2
choices:
1. get a new cat.
2. "punch out" the cat by removing it and cracking apart the element
inside with a metal rod. This is of course illegal in some states but
fine for off-road use. 

PS: commonly if you run the car for extended periods with an ignition
miss the excessive hydrocarbons cause the cat to overheat and "melt
down". You can try this at home by disconnecting a few plug wires on
your favorite car and watching the cat glow after about 15 minutes.
Then you can replace it too.

I am running my '87 951 at several track events each season. I have installed

around, switching to green compound in front this year per dealer
recommendation).

Winter project: I am about to replace my front rotors (again).

Question: Should I spend the extra bucks for drilled rotors?? (I am
considering the ones Automotion sells). Will the extra cost be justified by
longer rotor life and freedom from warping, or will the eventual cracking
around the drilled holes reduce life to one track season anyway?

Any one have any advice/experience with drilled rotors on 951s/944s??

Facetiousness aside, Halon extinguishers are some of the most effective per

Subject: squeak, squeak on 944

My '89 944S2 has developed a intermittent squeak associated with wheel
speed. I can hear it (when it is happening) clearly from the driver's
window, so I am pretty sure it is on the left side. I can't be really sure
if it is from the front or rear wheel, though. I thought it might be related
to the brakes, and also noticed that my rear pads were virtually worn
through, so I just changed them last night.

Bad news today! The squeak is still there. To repeat, it is intermittent,
and it varies in pitch with wheel speed, not engine speed. It seems to go
away if I tap the brkes, but it often comes right back.

Thoughts, anyone?  Is this a symptom of impending wheel bearing trouble?
(When I had the wheels off I did not notice any play.)  I certainly don't want
a catastrophe.

  OFFICE MEMO         Spark Plug Wire Theory                Date:  2/17/94
In response to a number of probing questions about my spark plug wire
posting:  

CONDUCTIVITY:  The most conductive common metals are Gold, Silver, 
and Copper.  Gold and Silver are obviously out because they are too
expensive to use as spark plug wires.  This leaves Copper as the best
choice.  

PURPOSE OF SHIELDED WIRES:  The purpose of shielded wires is to
minimize the radiation of electro magnetic interference (EMI).  In other
words, when current flows along a conductor (e.g. the spark plug wires)
it creates a magnetic field.  When this magnetic field intersects another
conductor it generates a current in that conductor (e.g.  one spark plug
wire can theoretically generate an unwanted current in an adjacent wire).  

A second result of EMI is that it can generate noise in a radio.  The antenna
in a car is designed to pick up weak EMI signals broadcast by AM/FM radio
transmitters.  It can also pick up EMI generated by current flowing through
your spark plug wires.

IS SHIELDING REALLY NECESSARY:  In reality, the EMI generated in one spark
plug wire is so weak that it is highly unlikely that it can induce an
unwanted sparking voltage in an adjacent wire.  This is because of the
distance between the two wires (the strengh of the magnetic field decreases
in direct proportion to the square of the distance between the conductors).

When it comes to radio interference, the same rule applies.  The great
acception occurs when there is a loose or broken connection.  That causes the
spark to arch across at some point when it's not supposed to arch.  This
causes the familiar rhythmic popping in the AM radio that increases with RPM
(also referred to as static).  This should be taken as an indication that the
ignition system needs attention not that it needs shielding!

CAPACITANCE DISCHARGE SYSTEMS:  A CD ignition system produces a higher
voltage and a stronger spark than conventional ignition systems.
In 1971 Porsche began to use CD ignition systems.  Some may argue that
shielded spark plug wires are needed to suppress the stronger EMI produced by
the higher voltages.  I argue, as above, that a well maintained ignition
system will not produce noticeable interference.  In an apparent confirmation
of this argument, the new Porsche Carreas come stock with unshielded ignition
wires.  The wires are spaced a little further apart that previous models.

HIGH WATTAGE STEREO AMPLIFIERS:  A possible exception might exist with the
use of a stereo system that is highly amplified.  The purest music-phile
might justify the added expense of shielded ignition wires in order to hear
that last nuance, that perfect violin note, that inimitable trill of a far
off flute, that loud BOOM of synthesized rap!

ALTERNATOR NOISE:  The alternator is usually more responsible for radio noise
than the ignition system.  The alternator generates high amperage and uses
diodes to convert from alternating current to direct current (AC to DC). 
These diodes often are electrically noisy.  Alternator noise can usually be
eliminated by replacement of noisy diodes.

POTENTIAL PROBLEM WITH SHIELDED WIRES:  Shielded wires must be grounded.  If
there is a crack in the insulation of the enclosed spark plug wire or a loose
connection the shielding is in a convenient place for the high tension
voltage in the spark plug wire to jump to ground.  This causes misfiring.

IN SUMMARY:  I personally feel shielded wires are an unnecessary expense.

Hope I don't start a war......

Depends what you are doing with them. If you are going to paint them, I 
would recommend using a sandblaster if you have access to one. The chrome 
will just flake off after just a few seconds. Of course you need to be 
careful about getting carried away and eroding the metal. Another 
alternative is to just roughen up the chrome REAL good and use a "powder

not be able to get a color match. But if you are going for the blacked

Lou,

From what I understand, drilled rotors should not be used for everyday
driving.  It's designed mainly for off-road type driving like on the
track.  In fact, there is a disclaimer in a car club magazine I read from
an advertiser that sells drilled rotors.  It states "these rotors should
not be used in normal day driving."

I don't know if Porsche does this or not(if they don't they should) but 
what I suspect that you are hearing is the wear indicators for your brake 
pads. On Disc brakes, it is common to put a small spring on the pad that 
will rub on the disc when the pad is worn sufficiently. Because its a 
spring, it oscillates and creates the squeaking noise that you describe. 
When you apply the brakes, it squashes the spring so that it can't vibrate.
That's why it returns(the squeak) when you release them.

Hope it helps

This is for safety.  The aluminum arms are much stronger than the steel 
ones.  A stronger front bar can transmit *much* more force to the A-arm 
than stock, fatiguing the steel.  Even aluminum arms can fail like 
this, but it's much less common.  The deal is that the mount point 
(hole) gets really stressed, and eventually fails.

Get the aluminum arms; you'll be safer!  They're lighter too...

Lou, drilled rotors' advatage is mostly in keeping the pad/rotor 
interface clean.  This primarily means keeping water & small grit 
cleaned-off.  They will not have a longer life; in fact it'll likely be 
shorter.  The holes create stress areas that will slowly spider-crack.

As for getting aftermarket rotors, be *very* careful!  The rotor 
material must be selected with drilling in mind.  It is not safe to 
take a stock rotor and drill it.  In PCA Northeast Region, we do not 
allow aftermarket drilled rotors at our track events - OEM / correct 
racing drilled rotors are the only acceptable ones.  Sometimes it's 
hard to tell what you're buying though...

I'm surprised that you're still having warping problems with all the 
mods you've made; that usually cures it.  I might suggest, ahem, that 
you brake less...   :-)

Subject: Noisy Valve on 931

Hello P-philes,

I am experiencing a strange thing with my '82 931 and am seeking 
some advice.  A skilled Porsche mechanic just installed my 
reground (stock turbo) cam. The cam followers were also 
resurfaced and ground.  Three of the eight original cam followers 
had to be replaced because they were severely worn.  The head was 
not removed because there was no evidence of worn valves or 
guides.  The engine has 103K on it, but runs very strong, uses no 
oil.

Here is the problem.  Since the installation of the reground cam, 
a periodic loud metallic noise (tapping) builds up and then 
diminishes to zero intensity as the engine idles at ca. 1000 RPM.  
This recurs continuously with more quiet time than noise time.  
The cam followers are adjusted properly, but the noise is clearly 
associated with the motion of a single valve.  My mechanic tells 
me that the periodicity of the noise is related to the action of 
the valve "rotator" and that it comes and goes as the valve stem 
rotates at the same time it goes up and down in the guide.

This makes sense, except I am worried about why it is making 
noise at all.  Should I be seriously worried about this?  My 
mechanic has essentially told me not to.  He seems to think there 
is eccentricity to the valve, but that this is just effectively 
changing the valve lash through part of the rotation and that 
this is not too serious.  On the other hand, I have visions of 
valve stems sticking in the guides and pulling out parts of the 
head!

Any thoughts on the matter would be appreciated.

Thanks.

The squeaking is not brake pad wear indicators.  Porsche uses a wire loop

caliper.  When it wears through the circuit opens up and a light comes on
on the dash.  Note, all four loops are connected in series.  When one
has done its duty (making the ultimate sacrifice...) it must be replaced
($50 per at the dealer, ~$15 elsewhere).

Ted,
  I noticed no change in the $500+ parts I ordered last week. In fact,
when I took the catalog price less 20%, the sale price often was rounded 
DOWN to a nice number, makeing the saving marginally more than 20%.
Maybe it depends on what you're ordering.

Yes, your odometer has the same error as your speedometer.  If your
speedometer reads fast for your speed, then your odometer reads long
for the actual distance driven.  A good reason for a calibrated speedo's
and big rear tires.

At $5 per ounce, silver is not as bad cost-wise as it used to be.
How many ounces would be needed for a set of wires? However, there
are a number of other properties of silver (brittleness, corrosion)
that may make it an unsuitable material.

I don't know if that's right or not, but you should be able to check
it yourself fairly easily.  Just get on interestate and clock yourself
between mile markers.  You'll have to maintain a fairly constant speed.
Divide 3600 by the number of seconds it took between markers to get
miles/hour.  This should give you a pretty good idea if you are at 
least in the ball park.

It's best to do this several times since the highway department
may not be too dependable on spacing of the mile markers.

OK, here's mine. Leave your plastic pocket protector at home if you want

Just a note on my experiences with warped front rotors on late model 44s. It
cost Porsche Cars six of them on my 89 s2 before the problem was finally traced
to an out of spec front hub. Don't have the paperwork handy, but as I recall it

Fred, is the last number in your VIN 3 or 5?  Our cars must be siblings. Maybe
Joyce T will get me to tell my "Brakes from Hell" story one day. After pad
replacements and upgrades, installation of anti-squeal hardware, and even

The fact that I've been able to eliminate the noise temporarily by these
"methods" leads me to believe its not a bearings problem (which was my first
suspicion).  Also, after 35,000 miles, if it had been a bearing, it would have
self-destructed long ago.  A front pad replacement and general cleaning may
help, but in my case, it provided only limited relief to what appears to be
no more than an auditory annoyance.

This is my region...Does this mean that specifically designed for racing

Or am I reading this wrong? Is it OEM only?

The peron who was considering drilled rotors may also want to consider 
slotting them. Same results w/ less machining therefore less cost. It is 
true that ALL drilled rotors crack. Haven't had any experience with 
slotted rotors myself, but perhaps they're more suited to street & track 
application.  The main advantage of drilled rotors is to 
provide an exit for the high temp./high pressure gasses that build up 
under the pads. I really can't imagine any "water" not instantly boiling 
off as it hits a 500-1000 deg rotor.

I've heard warping is unavoidable with the "stock OEM" rotors. The brake 
system was most likely not designed for extensive track time. 

One trick I've been taught by some Firehawk guys is to do your braking in 
stages. Usually one off the pedal "breath" in the middle of your braking will
be enough to release those gasses, heat etc and save a rotor or pad that 
would otherwise "cook". Again this is a way around an OEM problem and not 
a fix like real rotrs would be. ;-) And obviously it increases your 
braking distance proportionally.

Is anyone else going to the MID-OHIO track event in April??

I would say the opposite.  If I were just using the car on the track,
I would go for a small extinguisher, perhaps.  This is because weight
is important on a track car; and more importantly, there will be
corner workers at the track with _real_ fire extinguishers.  You will
only need to hold the fire for 30 seconds or so until help arrives.
On the street, however, you'd want a more serious extinguisher...
maybe not halon at all, since you'd have to be able to completely
extinguish the fire: if you have to wait for the F.D. to finish the
job, your car is likely to be toast by the time they arrive.

Halon is neat stuff; it really knocks fire down fast (not by excluding
oxygen, BTW, it's more complicated than that).  However, it is not a
very good choice for an engine fire, unless you can quickly follow it
with water, foam, or powder agents.  The reason: halon blows away.  It
does not remove significant heat from the fire, as water does.  When
the bottle is empty, the fire can start up again and then run away.
I've seen it happen several times.

"ABC" or "Purple-K" dry chemical extinguishers are perhaps the best
choice for car fire extinction, when you are doing more than providing
a temporary escape for the occupants.  Yes, they may cause some
electrical system damage, but you'll be less likely to lose the whole car.

Also, halons 1301 and 1211 are environmental no-nos, and they will be
very scarce real soon now.  Perhaps a good replacement will fill the void.

Subject: Speedo/Odo Errors


Speedometer and odometer errors are not always correlated.

Speedometers have an eddy current drive.  A magnet on the end of the speedo
cable rotates inside a metal cup attached to the speedo needle.  The cup
tries to rotate but is held back by a spring.  The coupling force is
proportional to the rotational speed of the magnet.  Calibration errors arise
from such things as tire OD errors, speedo gearing errors and spring constant
errors.

In contrast, odometers are geared to the speedometer cable and count
revolutions.  Errors arise mostly from uncertainties in tire diameter.  

If the speedometer error is dominated by the spring constant then there will
not be a correlation between speed and distance errors.  Only when the
errors are dominated by the common pieces (tires, gears) will there be a
correlation.

Another source of errors is due to altering final drive ratios (depending
on where,exactly, the speedo cable is attached).

    Ted,

	I've never compared prices before and after, but I _can_ comment
    on their service.  For my first order, I bought a 914 special edition
    air dam.  When it arrived, it was obvious that it had been damaged
    during shipping, not due to improper packaging.  Automotion called 
    the shipper to pick up the damaged part and immediately shipped the 
    new part.  They also added a very nice calendar to the order.  When 
    I called them about the calendar, they told me it was complimentary 
    to make up for any inconvenience I may have experienced.  On top of 
    that, they were ALWAYS polite.  It's rare to find service that good 
    today, and for that reason alone, they have won a great deal of my 
    business.  If anyone out there works for or is closely connected with 
    Automotion, you people do a GREAT job!

Re: Drilled Rotors. I have no personal experience w/ drilled rotors since

I have all my rotors slotted and believe this was worth the effort. I do 
intend to try cross drilled rotors as I get into the season to see if 
there's a difference. Porsche AG must not feel that cross drilled rotors 
are only for track use. Cross drilled rotors on the 930s have been std for 
a long time. The new 993s have cross drilled rotors std as well and I think 
the current 928GTS does as well.
However, here's something to contemplate (and maybe somebody can even 
explain): At the Chicago Auto Show there were 3 Indy cars on display, 
Mansell's, Fittipaldi's and a Honda, which is probably Rahal's. I don't 
know which was which but one had cross drilled rotors, one had slotted 
rotors and one had no machining on the discs at all!?!?!?!?!

Re: Putting heavier sway bar on the stamped steel A-arms. DON'T. Personal

bracket. Only the tire hitting the rear of the inside of the wheel well 
kept the spindle,brake, wheel, etc from leaving the car completely. On 
inspection I saw that the other A-arm had developed a crack as well. These

This means the car you bought probably has more mileage than you imagined..

If my car had 150k miles on it and I saw a used speedo at a junkyard with 40k

Subject: fire extinguishers

Dear Patty, 
 
I recently faced the same dilemma looking for a fire extinguisher for my 
autocrosser.  I was taken back by the cost of the halon models.  So I asked 
an insurance investigator friend of mine for advice. 
 
The first thing he said is let the thing burn and tell the insurance company 
it happened on the road (thanks for the help). 
 
After persuading him that this was unacceptable, he said that Halon is the 
only way to go.  The alternatives are the purple K and other dry chemical or 
carbon dioxide.  The dry chemicals make a hell of a mess and could destroy 
your engine especially if you run with open manifolds (Harry Pellow had a 
story in one of his books about a guy who tried to start his 356 after 
extinguishing a minor fire that lead to a broken connecting rod).  Carbon 
dioxide can also be a problem because spraying dry ice on a hot alloy engine 
could lead you into a world of hurt. 
 
Now, the reason why halon is so expensive is because the manufacture of 
halon has been abandoned (under the Montreal Protocol) because it depletes 
stratospheric ozone.  Unfortunately, DOT and the other powers-to-be have not 
yet OK'd any of the "soft CFCs" for use as fire retardants.  Therefore all 
the ones on the market are using up available stock of halon and it is 
getting dear.  Therefore, until a new one is named, halon extinguishers are

  Almost.  Actually, the noise is transparent in a FM receiver.  Ignition
noise is mostly in the amplitude modulation domain, that's why you only
hear it on AM and SEE it on TV...
  
  Another radiation entry point is the power leads or low level signal input.
That is RADIATED SUSCEPTIBILITY...the kind you get laying wires too close
to one another.

  Finally, CONDUCTED SUSCEPTIBILITY is the kind of noise
you get when a contact closes (like a turn signal flasher or brush type
motor) and a repeating voltage transient is propagated back thru the
electrical
system and into the radio or power amp.

  Depends.  Depends on the ignition system.  Depends on the length of spark
wire, routing of the wires, the humidity, time of day...etc.
  Its dangerous to make broad assumptions, so the designers (or whomever
is doing the EMC work) test the product with equipment and specifications
with the intent to make a product that wont cause a recall later.
  Sometimes to ensure that the manufacturing tolerances wont cause a problem,
the designers add something like outer braid to ignition wires to gaurantee
a minimal margin of protection.
  You have to keep in mind that someone's life could be at stake if radio
communications are disrupted (an ambulance failed to receive orders) by
the presence of your car idling in the lane next door. 
  -OR the dadburned ECM loses it mind when you change blower speeds, key the
shortwave, or rev the engine over 6k...(more likely)
  The scenarios are endless.
  THAT is the why for shielding.

  BBBZZZZTT!  partly wrong.
  Diodes (actually rectifiers in this application) either work or not.
The failure mode is like this:  shorted or open.

  The noise source in an alternator is the type of current it generates
and that is AC or Alternating Current...it is power in amplitudinal form.
  The rectifiers are used to smooth out the waves of power generated by
the coils in the alternator (three phase in most cases).
  If one of the 'struts' in the bridge rectifier fails, the power flow is
disrupted and the result is what you hear in the AM radio or power amp'ed
stereo, repetition rate depending on rpm of the coils in the alternator.

  In a properly funtioning alternator, there is always some parasitic AC
because the carmaker's dont put filtration on these circuits.  It is not
that necessary since most electrical accessories are immune to the noise.

  You have forgotten one other very hefty noise source: Fan blower motors.
  Most of these are brush (carbons) type and generate a Fourier spectrum 
that will knock your socks off!  That is why most of these have a filter
of some kind (capacitor or ferrite or both).  Sometimes these are called
'hash' filters.  Since the motor on these is mostly enclosed, shielding is
very effective as far as radiated emission, but without a hash filter these
are profuse at generating conducted emissions of very wide spectrum and
energy distribution!  Avoid routing wires near blower power leads.

  A good example of this is Van Halen on that song they play the drill
motor next to the guitar...that's flux pickup on his guitar's string
transducers NOT accoustic energy.

  If you hear this noise in your FM radio, check the power amp first for
a poor wire routing, long runs or lack of a filter choke on the power input
or poor GROUNDS.  -its conducted, NOT radiated (discriminated by FM) noise. 
  If you hear this on AM radio, then the noise could be radiated or conducted.
  -or maybe Van Halen has moved into your back seat...

  AH! but the shielding is providing a PATH for that stray energy...and
not letting all of it escape into space (and into your radio, someone's tv 
or my EMI receiver).  Did you know that i can tell the condition of YOUR
cars ignition system just by listening to my receiver as you drive by?
Well, its true...I can tell if your overreving too! Cellphone traffic is NOT

  Ok, so you are willing to debate in public what the Porsche designers
debated in private...
  They (the Porsche-erds) must have come to the conclusion that the car
needed something to boost the margin of acceptable performance given
the variables that do occur over the life cycle of an ignition system.
  Many of us know how much an ignition system overhaul costs, im sure the
Porsche designers were also aware.  They didnt do shielded wires because
it looked cool on their boxer six...

It is not difficult but you have to glue things.  You will learn to love
glue. 
I'm assuming you have a coupe in answering this question. 
 
You have to take both the windshield and the back window
out.  This means you should get new seals for both.  This gives you an
opportunity to inspect the windshield and rear window channels for rust,
which is not unusual in the lower corners.  When you find it there are
several good passivators on the market that should be applied according to
directions.  Then can be painted over with any good automotive paint.

Headliner installation is surprisingly easy.  To glue the edges use a good
contact cement.  Some trimming of excess material is necessary.  I suggest
you get about four dozen spring clip clothes pins to hold the 
edges of the headliner in place until the cement sets.  Hope this helps. 
Good luck.

The 904 in the picture has approximately 7000KM on the odometer, it finished
something like 7th at LeMans in '67 or '68.  The owner bought that car from a
banker (who got it from the factory) in the bay area in the mid '70s for
$7500 and he was worried he paid too much.  Today that car is worth about
$350K+ (some speculate as much as $500k).  That day was increadible. We
arrived in snow, and the 30 minutes it took to arrange and wipe off the cars
was the only sunshine all day!  

You are right - there was a lot of Red.  We tried to get a red car from every
year, but were about missing about 6 or 7 years.  My '93 RS America (right
behind the Porsche Indy car, 2nd from the left) was the newest car.  The

Subject: Cutting out when hot and under load

Yesterday, it was only a little cool outside and sunny, and I got caught
in heavy traffic.  The 911 got a little hotter than usual, but nothing
much (top of the lower area, normally just below the top - as you've
guessed, I don't have the numbered temp guage).  Then, when I accelerated
briskly, it would cut out, and would stay so until I eased up on the
throttle.  At some point then, it would recover just fine.  It was cutting
out at various points over 3000 rpm.  When I got to my apartment, I opened
the hood and played with the throttle by hand.  Again, at higher revs, it
would cut out.  Furthermore, the second time I did this, a loud and very
bright explosion emerged from the tailpipe when I let off the throttle and
it 'recovered', which left my ears ringing for a minute or two.  This makes
me think the gas probably hadn't stopped flowing!  Any ideas?  Could it be
fuel?  CD?  Electrical?

An average of three miles should do it since the mile markers are very
accurately surveyed (at least in Florida). If you find a
long straight stretch of road that parallels a rail line, use the
railroad's mile markers. They are very, very accurate.

The climate control on my 86 944 Turbo seems to be sticking on heat.  With
the temp. control on the lowest setting and the compressor switch off it
blasts winds as hot as the fires of hell. With the compressor switch on,
it tries to cool but with little effect.  The compressor was just checked
and the system was checked for leaks.  So it seems that the heater is stuck on.

This is really getting grim because out highs are in the 70's every day.

Why buy another spedo?  The VDO units seem to be easy to fiddle with so if
I were that type of person I wouldn't bother buying another spedo.   It is
very likely that the spedo is off 8 or even 10%. Mine is.  What I find
interesting is that mine is optimistic by about 8% at 60 mph and every one
else is reporting optimistic spedos.  Is this a general problem with VDO?

Sorry to send this to the whole list.  Peter Jones posted a request for

Peter,

Concerning your information request on Haltech for 914's; My mechanic, Jeff
Chandler has done a couple of Haltech setups for 4 cylinder 914's, so you
might want to contact him directly (Jeff_Chandler@onenet-bbs.org,
303-444-2585), he is an authorized Haltech dealer.  The driveability
(throttle response) of a 2.0 liter 914 was very impressive with the Haltech
installed.

What class do you run your 914-6 in?.  Neither the Haltech or the CIS you
currently have are legal for SCCA F-Prepared, but would be OK for E-Modified.
 You are required to use either Weber 40 IDA or 46 IDA carbs in F-Prepared,
with a 2.7 engine your minimum weight is 2100 lbs, and a maximum of 10" wide
rims may be used. If you're running PCA Parade M-3 class you can use whatever
injection you want, but you are limited to 7" wide rims.  Club Racing Class B
would also allow anything on the injection side.

Subject: Cool Brake Kits

>>In response to AAW's question about what a Cool Brake kit is:

Cool Brake Kits are designed to bring additional cooling air to bear on the
front disk brake rotors. There are a number of kits on the market; the one I
have was made from the old Holbert racing molds. I believe this business has
been sold a few times since Al Holbert's death. In the latest Porsche
Panorama magazine, OG Racing appears to be selling them: you can call them at
703-491-7223. Haven't dealt with them personally.

Basically, the kit for the 944Turbo/951 is slick: it replaces the splash
plate behind the front rotors with new plates having a tube brazed to the
inboard side. Over this tube fits a hose like a "clothes dryer vent hose"
which is connected to a plastic scoop which is mounted behind the front
bumper vent slots. The original Porsche scoops just sort of directed air in
the general area of the rotors; the Cool Brake kit takes the ram air from the
scoop and ducts it via the hose to the new splash plate and thus into the
center of the vented rotor. The air is forced into the center of the rotor
and exits radially through the vent vanes, thus increasing the airflow and
the cooling effect.

The result is dramatic; lots less fade due to boiling brake fluid in the
rotors. Of course, when driving out I-90 to Watkins Glen and encountering the
inevitable intense thunderstorm, these ducts become water ducts. However, I
have not experienced any great problem, since disk brakes tend to be fairly
resistant to water fade anyway.

I would recommend the kits to anyone tracking their car. Autocrossers
probably don't build up enough brake temp to worry about. For street, I would
guess they're worthless unless you drive through Immigrant Pass every day or
something. I understand that there are kits for 911s and C2/C4s as well.
OBTW, you do need to remove the front rotors to install; not a big deal but
wouldn't want you to be surprised!

Hope this is useful...

Subject: RE: Squeaking brakes

All disk brake pad have a tendency to "wobble" a bit in the caliper and brush
against the turning rotor. This causes them to oscillate and the oscillations
vibrate the air which causes sound (I knew those physics classes would come
in handy someday :-)  . (Volvo calipers may be the worst design in the world
for this.)

The squeaking caused by this effect will instantly vanish with light
application of the brake pedal; if it does not, some other cause may be the
culprit!

There appear to be three solutions:

1) Live with it
2) Drive with your foot on the brake (not recommended)
3) Apply anti-squeal pads to the back of the brake pads. These foam pads are
typically self adhesive (use on new pads, or solvent clean the old ones
before applying or they won't stick). They damp the vibrations, and therefore
the noise. However, I understand they are not recommended if you run on the
track, as the high temperatures tend to melt the foam. No problem for street
only use though!

Hope this helps...

I have the 944 Porsche shop manual and have changed the coolant a
number of times on a 944 engine.  The procedure for bleeding the air
is straight forward.  Open the bleeder valve and add coolant to
the reservoir until it is filled to the max mark.  Start the engine.
As it warms up, coolant will bubbles out of the bleeder valve.  When
coolant is coming out of the valve without any bubbles then shut the
valve and let the engine come up to temperature.  When it cools down
top off the coolant in the reservoir.

Well, this is true in the early stages of the radio, but once the

OEM is preferred, but aftermarket racing rotors designed to be drilled 
are OK too.  What we *don't* want is regular rotors getting drilled, 
"cause it's cool and the turbos look that way".  Those rotors can crack 
spontaneously, without previous wearing or heating.

Check the heater valve itself; it's located in front of the firewall, 
directly above the bell housing.  You can operate it by hand without 
damaging it.  It runs via vacuum, so it's possible the line fell off or 
is leaking.  I do not know whether the "default" state is heat on or off.

Alternate your heat control from max cold to max hot and see if the 
little acutating arm moves.  If not, and the above-mentioned vacuum

Yes, this is a reason that little fire bottles are useful only in 
*particular* types of fires.  Hot exhaust burning dry grass (say, 
during an off-road excursion at a track) will not be helped by an 
on-board system.  External sources (water truck) help here.  Or better, 
get the car off the grass

Maybe for putting out fires dry chemical is good, but I disagree for 
auto use!  Dry chemical corrodes metal like engine parts, wires, etc.  
You can really trash an engine if you spray D.C. on an engine fire.  
It's also dangerous when used in close contact to people, whereas Halon 
is fine (assuming window open, short exposure).

Well, not really - how much do idle extinguishers contribute to the

While you tech whiz's are debating shielding vs. not, I'd like to
read each of your explanations regarding solid core vs. EMI
(resistor) core wiring.  Can you discuss impedance matching,
reflections from the plug, change in impedance at the plug as the
fuel/air charge comes in and as the spark flashes over?  This is an
area I'm interested in, regardless of EMI generation.

Looking forward to it all ..

Subject: 928 Key Duplicates

How do y'all go about getting keys made for your '28?  There are two
methods I know of:

Order the key from the Reno warehouse, made to the specs of your key
number (~$55).  This takes a while, and if you bought a used car
without the proper key info included, then Porsche wants you to buy a
new set of locks for ~$600 plus installation.  Under no circumstances 
will they sell you a GD blank key!

Find a local key shop that stocks 928 blanks.  There is only one within
a few hundred miles of here, and he personally buys his blanks direct
from Germany (Silca brand, and they don't last) These cost $25 and he
can make them on the spot.

How does everybody else do it?

Subject: Re: Drilled rotors

Lou,

I would recommend against switching one end of your car to a different
compound than used at the other, in your case green and blue.  There are
differences in their coefficients of friction which will affect braking.
Moreover, you car should be fine, I think, with blue pads.  Your car
weighs only about 100 lbs. more than mine, you don't go much faster, and
you have considerably greater pad area.  I run the blues without any
rotor problems.

You should also have plenty of cooling if the Cool Brake kit has been
installed correctly.  951's used to have rotor problems, particularly at
hard-braking tracks like the old Bryar.  But with the advent of Cool
Brake, those problems went away.  I'd start by checking that your kit
is hooked up right and doing what it should.  Are the ducts whole and
as direct as possible?  Are the fibreglass fittings, which duct into the
eye of the rotor, correctly installed?  Are the inlet ducts getting
enough unimpeded air through the front airdam?

I don't think drilled rotors will run any cooler.  You might even be
worse off because of the reduced rotor mass (heat sink) and impeded
conductivity due to the holes (I'm reaching...).  Drilling has two
benefits: better water extraction in the wet, and better pad gas and
dust extraction all the time.

The disadvantage is the inevitable stress risers that each hole creates.
If for some reason you are living on the edge now, switching to drilled
rotors will only make things worse.  (Btw, for reasons I don't entirely
agree with, NER does not allow non-OE drilled rotors.)

Speaking of heat sinks, how far down have you let the rotors wear
before changing them?  You'll find that your brakes work better and you
have fewer heat-related woes with full-depth rotors.

The only other suggestion I'd make is to learn to use your brakes less.
Everyone, me included, at some point seems to develop the habit of using
more brake than is necessary.  It has also been suggested that, if you
are going to do X amount of braking, then to quote the Bard "tis best
done quick."  That is, do a lot of braking quickly, rather than a little
braking for a longer time.  Dunno exactly why this ought to help.

Anyone know what this recall was, I didn't get a chance to ask the owner.

I was amazed at how much better this car felt then a 1988 Turbo we drove,
its hard to explain but the car just felt like it was on rails. I know
this car has bigger brakes and a beefer suspension but I didn't think
the difference would be so dramatic.

I would like to get some information about changing out the engine in my
77 911 (2.7) to a 3.2.  I stopped by one of the local Porsche shops and he
quoted a price of 5K with exchange and installation for a low mileage 3.2.
Among the things that need to be changed/not changed he said that the fuel
pump would not have to be changed from what I have now.  This is where I am
confused.  Another shop that I talked with said that it would need to be
changed, because the 3.2 used a low pressure system and the 2.7 used a high
pressure system.  My question to you, what things need to be added/changed to
the system when moving from a 2.7 to a 3.2?  The price sounds great from the
guy, but maybe too great (like to good to be true).

It also has tighter bushings all around - this is probably what 
accounts for the difference.  The 951S is really, really a nice, fast,

Subject: Cutting out when hot and under load (BlaineDeLancey)

Blaine -

You don't say what year your 911 is, but if it is 84 or later, it could 
be a faulty cylinder head temperature sensor. These sensors detect if 
the heads are too hot, and when tripped, tell the DME to go full rich. 
The extra fuel cools the heads. Symptoms are ones you describe (cutting 
out) with a big cloud of black smoke and/or backfire.

This is not an uncommon problem with the sensors (one of the very few 
problems with the otherwise bulletproof 3.2s) and a new one will cost 
about $150.

Porsche changed the design of these in 89 or so when the earlier 
problems began to show.

would not be the most general case of a spark plug wire.)

You gotta bite the bullet and pull ALL the windows out, plus the 
door weatherstripping.  I had a friend in the glass business come 
over at the beginning and end of the weekend to R&R the windsheild 
and rear window. The rear quarter-windows are easy to remove.  
Some more hints:

You'll need an assistant unless you're *really* a glutton for 
punishment.  Before you start, remember to reglue the fiber 
soundproofing mat to the roof:  it's probably loose or 
disintegrating by now.  For the headliner, start at the front- 
center of the windshield and work back equally along both sides to 
the rear pillars.  Steal a bunch of those small 1/4" paper clamps 
from your office:  they're perfect for clamping the headliner to 
the window frames and door jambs as you glue.  If you hate gluing 
things, you're gonna REALLY hate doing your headliner...  I used 
3M weatherstrip cement in original creamy yellow.  It was a 
full-day job for a novice like me.  Use adequate ventilation, 
and/or wear a respirator if you want to keep your senses:  you'll 
need them, because it's a very frustrating job.

Also, don't cut the courtesy light holes until the gule is set, 
like overnight.  The courtesy lights will push the headliner in at 
that point, so test the headliner tension in these areas to see if 
the lights will cause a wrinkle.  Don't ask me how I know.  

This is a labor-intensive job, but you'l save $$ if you do it 
yourself, and if you're patient, it'll really make the interior 
shine!

     I just thought I'd add that Halon is not quite as harmless to hardware 
as one might think.  According to what I have read, when exposed to heat 
(like in a fire, or if inhaled through a lit cigarette), Halon breaks down 
into its constituent elements, which include a number of elements from that 
group referred to as halogens (hence the name "Halon").  If memory serves, 
in the case of Halon, this includes Chlorine (Cl), Fluorine (F) and Bromine 
(Br).  At any rate, these react with the moisture in the air, steal the 
hydrogen out of the water molecules, and create hydrochloric (HCl), 
hydrofluoric (HF), and hydrobromic (HBr) acids.  While the concentrations 
involved may cause less damage than dry chemical or an uncontrolled fire, 
these are still nasty chemicals and will corrode stuff.
     The article from which I gleaned this information dealt with fire 
protection for electronic systems, so your mileage may vary.  Also, since my 
chemistry background is fairly weak, the net's collective wisdom may wish to 
dispute this.  Knock yourselves out.  Later...  JW

Subject: Sticking accelerater pedal in 911.


Both my friend (89 Carrera) and myself (79 SC) have both encountered the same
problem with our 911s, namely a sticky/tight accelerator linkage. 
The symptoms are, that the revs take time to die down when the foot is taken
off the accelerator pedal and sometimes even require the pedal to be lifted !
(This can be quite a good way to test the rev limiter as the clutch is 
engaged to up shift and the load comes off the engine ;-) )

In both cars, the culprit seems to be the hinge like contraption on the side of
the gearbox which converts the forwards/backwards motion of the pedal into an
up/down in the engine bay. This hinge only runs on nylon inserts which are
open to all the road dirt and grime and thus, over time, are liable to get
stiff. 
 
Now comes the hard part. The hinge can be removed by removing a split pin and
sliding it away from the gearbox BUT the rear trailing arm of the suspension
(I think that's what it is called) only allows about 2 inches of travel and
the part is about 4 inches long !

As an interim fix, I did manage to sand/clean the shaft while still partly
attached, but I would like to finish the job properly - maybe even fit new
nylon inserts. 

Anyone got any ideas how to remove the hinge without removing half the
suspension ?

Thanks for any help
Alisdair

P.S. Is this a common problem or were we just unlucky ?

On sunday someone put a dent in my 88 911 3.2 on the drivers
door. It looked like the panel was slightly scraped only just
through the paint and slightly pushed in. Anyway, I 
sent the 911 to the shop expecting that they would be able to
fix and respray this no problem....and they say it has to have 
a new door! This is because the dent is masked from behind by the
side impact bar, and thus they can't get to the skin.

I am, as they say, gutted :-( This is twice in two years that
someone has damaged my 911 and then driven off. The only good
thing about this time is that it happened in our tiny car park
at work. The security staff have a complete record of who
was parked where and when. Sadly the security cameras don't cover 
the bit where I was parked so I won't be able to hit the bastard 
with video evidence. 

BTW, thanks for those who correctly diagnosed why the 911 was not
going in a straight line. The answer was that the alignment of
the front wheels was out, and one of the strut inserts was in
marginal condition. One wheel alignment and two new strut
inserts and everything is OK now.

  For track events, POC requires an extinguisher rated at 10-BC.  From
what I understand, the rating is something like 10 seconds for electrical
or oil type fires.  The halon 10-BC is the larger of the two (5lb I believe)
while purple K 10-BC is smaller.  Both have their pros and cons.  Halon is 

more expensive, but has potentially less damaging side-effects as dry chem.
Having personally put out two engine fires with dry chemical, it's not pretty
but it's effective.

        Reply to:   RE>Watch out for these 911's

Generally speaking, the 74-77 years were Porsche's worst.  These
911 engines had stressed-out magnesium alloy cases and thermal
reactors.  The combination cooked seals, caused oil leaks and other
miscellaneous problems like pulled head studs.  They have a fairly
short lifespan before needing rebuilding.  This is very well known
and discussed.  The SC (78-83), with its new aluminum alloy case,
was probably Porsche's most durable, with the Carrera (84-89) a
close second.  200k+ is pretty common for a well maintained
engine (before having to open the case).  The early years (65-73)
went through numerous changes to engine size, FI/carb, wheelbase,
etc.  65-68 models had some teething problems.  Early ones had
problems with front end shake, and wheel/tire balance sensitivity.
The targa came out in 67.  Until 69 they had soft rear windows.
68 was a so-so year due to the air-injection system which caused
a lot of overheating and leaned-out trouble (ie, fouled plugs).
69-73 E and S models are valued today because of their light,
crisp handling and performance.  The T's are pretty slow and worth
less (not worthless!).  Pre 77 cars, except for some 76's, were not
galvanized.  Body rust was a serious (and $$) problem.  WATCH OUT.

The early cars are also notorious for tail wagging.  Not a problem
at all for an experienced driver, even an advantage.  But in the
hands of a neophyte...

Debate continues over which is best for a new buyer of a used 911.
Depends on what you want the car for.  If it's just to drive and
enjoy at minimal cost of upkeep the SC is an excellent choice.  If
you are going to race it there are all sorts of arguments.  But
everyone agrees on a few things: original is better, modified
bodies are to be avoided (due to the unknown reasons and lower
collector value), records and books matter (well cared for is
imperative), and a thorough exam by an expert Porsche mechanic
is essential.

Get your hands on the 10/93 issue of Panorama and refer to the
article on buying an older 911.  Excellence magazine has done a
few articles too.

Good luck!

    Well, you've got the "magic" rear hubs, so you can just have a machine shop
do the rears.  The easiest and best way, supposedly, to do the 5-bolt job up
front is to get a 911 suspension of similar vintage, and bolt the sucker right
in.  You also get bigger brakes that way.  You can also try calling up
PartsHeaven--they're trying to sell 5-bolt conversion kits right now....  Don't
remember their number, but it's in Pano and (I think) VW&Porsche....
    If you go the 911 suspension route, you might want to pick up the Vellios
trailing arm adapter kit for the rears, so you can put the 911 brakes on the
back, too, and still use the hand-brake.  I know, it's expensive, but you knew
that when you bought a Porsche.  (You *did* know that, didn't you?)

 -  They have honored discount coupons from their catalog that I didn't
    have with me (the one in the back of the catalog they mail to you)
 -  They have allowed me to buy stuff directly from their store at
    the 20% off sale price, even though the sale is for mail order only
 -  They have honored the sale discount days after it expired

Sometimes I had to whine a little but in every case they have been

    I've never done a headliner, but in case you haven't replaced a windshield
  successfully, what professionals do is this;
    1. Install the rubber on the windshield
    2. Put the Chrome trim into the rubber now (it will -not- go in after the
        windshield is set. If you try, you'll mangle the rubber and the trim).
    3. Get a length of 1/4" or bigger (I mean, 6mm or bigger...) sash cord and
       put it into the seam of the rubber around the perimeter of the gasket.
       Have both ends hanging out, side by side. With someone else putting
       pressure on the glass, pull the sash cord at a right angle from the
       glass; it will stretch the rubber lip out and over the metal frame. You
       can finish within 10 minutes doing this, versus taking an angled tool  
       and pulling on it a section at a time.
                
      For some reason, 911 windshields seem to leave an open gap at the upper
  corners. Start the position of the windshield fairly high on the car. 
  Given a good gasket, this may be the only place you may need to add
  silicone to stop leaks. 
     In case you don't have any idea how old your windshield seal is, I'd
   suggest replacing it. They age quickly and are cheap to replace. If it
   is old, a low-risk option is to cut the rubber thru when getting the
   glass out in lieu of manhandling the glass and cracking it.  
      The rear quarters and trim come out pretty easily, just use a little
   silicone on the installation.

Yeah, I apologize for that.  I posted that note just before leaving town,

Actually it's a general problem with people putting lower profile tires on
their cars, changing the rolling radius or whatever it's called, which
affects speedometer calibration.  Wasn't there a car-guy movie once where
the hero tried to explain to an officer-o-the-law that he had just
installed performance tires on his muscle car?  Anyways, I think most
Porsche speedometer optimism can be attributed to aftermarket tire
packages.  My '80 with 205/50-15 and 225/50-15 (not sure of the exact
dimensions - it's the standard setup these days for your basic 911SC) is
optimistic by about 5 mph @ 70 mph.

I think (given my admittedly amateur understanding of body repair) that the
door could be repaired at less expense than replacement.  There are
many circumstances where dents cannot be accessed from inside to
facilitate pounding them out.  The method I have seem employed is to
drill small holes in the dented region in which the tip of a tool is inserted.
This tool is like a bearing puller that has a sliding weight on a rod.  The
tip expands inside the panel and the weight is slid away from the panel
on the rod and hits the stop on the end of the rod.  This pulls the panel
out toward its original shape.  Now even if there were not sufficient space
behind the door panel for this tool's tip, it seems that nuts could be brazed
to the panel and the sliding weight rod screwed into those to achieve
the same end.  The holes would then be brazed/welded closed and/or
the nuts ground off before repainting.

Perhaps it would be worth asking some other body shops.

Good luck!

Subject: An interesting article about Tires on Acura NSX

Today's New York Times had an interesting (and prominent) article about angry
NSX owners.  It seems they are routinely wearing out their rear tires at less
than 10,000 miles.  Some of these owners are lawyers, and naturally, they are
suing Acura, Honda, the dealers, etc.  One guy wants a refund on his whole
car.

The tire in question is the Yoko A022. They rarely seem to last 10,000
miles, often 5000, and one car which crashed had bald rear tires after 3000
miles!

My impression: Acura is fitting a very foolish tire to this car. I don't
know any specs on the A022, but it sounds like it may be like the A008RS,
which wears out very quickly, and is ridiculous to put on a street car for
street use.

If anyone knows anything more about these tires, or this Acura story, chime

When I park at a parking lot, I ALWAYS park in the farthest end of the
lot where there are no cars.  I also pick the spot where the passenger
door is not facing another other car and I park at an angle.  Usually, people
drive alone so there's less of a chance the passenger door will open compared
to the driver's door.  Yes, I do this in order to avoid the situation above.

RE> 911 Purchase
    Someone out there was looking at buying a 911 Targa, '66-'90.  (Don't leave
much out, do ya?)  I didn't see any of our 911 guys taking a whack at it, so. .
.
    Targas came out in 67 or 68, so that leaves out the earliest year or three.
 Also, the first one or two years had the "soft rear window"-- basically the
back end of a convertible top behind the roll-bar.  If you want the glass rear
window that doesn't come down, you want 1969+.
    Years to watch out for:  74 - 77, or (almost?) any 2.7L motor.  These
engines seem to make too much power (eek!  What a concept!), so they can
practically pull themselves apart after a while!  (see recent archives on two
or three list members' 2.7L woes....)  They can be good, reliable engines, but
it usually takes big $$ to get them there (e.g., Dilavar studs, TimeSert,
etc.).
    Best years:  Get the latest thing you can afford in a 78+ (SC, Carrera, C2,
C4, etc....).  The 3.0L and larger engines seem to be just about bullet-proof. 
(Relatively.)  The 73 and older are good lightweight cars, but they make less
power overall, and they tend to have more problems because they are much older.
 The MFI, in particular, can be a nightmare to properly adjust.
    Whatever you decide, take the car to a reputable *Porsche* mechanic (net
necessarily the dealer, but one who knows 911s well!) and have it checked out. 
It could be the best $120 you spend on a car.  Porschephiles should hopefully
be able to provide you with the names of good mechanics in your area.

A damn good suggestion.  Remember, in a race car the purpose of the
fire extinguisher is to allow you, the driver, to escape... not
necessarily to put out the fire-- that's what the track workers do.
In this light, an installed system, with halon nozzles pointed at the
driver, as well as the engine and fuel areas, has vast advantage over
a bottle that must be manually removed, then pointed and operated, by
a possibly injured driver.  The old rule for installed systems is: if
you're going into the wall, without a doubt, then punch the halon dump
button NOW-- before you crash, go unconscious, and the fire starts.

Not so cut and dried.  "ABC" powder is corrosive to metal, but this
really only affects two areas: open electrical contacts/circuits
(so don't spray the whole car, just get what's burning!), and open
manifolds (open manifolds?? you got what you deserved!).  For
everything else, the corrosive action is so slow that if you wash the
car well with water (which the fire department will be hapy to do,
free of charge!), the problem is moot.  IMO.

The other dry chem agents are essentially non-corrosive.  And, Purple
K works better on liquid fuel fires than ABC (though not well on
ordinary solids).  I still say they're the best choices for a street
machine.

> Carbon dioxide can also be a problem because spraying dry ice on a hot

CO2 is indeed a poor choice.  Why carry a 30 lb pressure vessel which
is less effective than a 10 pound drychem or halon unit?  

Note that you're not going to crack any engines with CO2 unless you
really try to.  The heat capacity of CO2 just isn't there, even though
it's so cold.  You might freeze your hand, though.

I really don't see the difference between a 2.5 lb and a 5 lb halon
bottle.  Both are so small that they will put out only the littlest of
fires under the hood.  Again: a preplumbed system is far better.

With halon and the fact that it goes away when unconfined, a bigger
bottle translates to a longer time that you'll be able to hold the
fire down.  When the bottle runs out, the fire will usually return. 
If you're buying a plumbed system, pay attention to the _discharge
time_, not strictly the size:  Discharge time = escape time.

How about this: buy a Purple K bottle, and with the "extra money",
practice by dumping the contents on a real fire.  Learn how it works,
and your skill will more than make up for any differences in the
agent's capabilities.  There are a lot of wrong ways to use a fire
extinguisher, and few right ones.

Water and foam extinguishers are great, but they come in very large,
unwieldy sizes.  

1.25 lb of halon will put out a small wok of chinese food--that's all.
Great for next to the stove... you can still eat the kung pao afterwards.

See my comments above regarding corrosion.  I see it as a minimal
problem in most car fires.  And dangerous to people?  Sure, if your
spray drychem in someone's face, they will have a problem... it stings
the eyes and makes you cough.  But they are not toxic, and for your
"window open, short exposure" case, or under the hood, it's a non-issue.

My point is that 1211 and 1301 are scarce and getting scarcer.  Halons
will be VERY expensive for those who need to refill bottles in the
very near future.  There are other substitute agents out, but none yet
that is a drop-in replacement.


Bottom line: Halon knocks down fires very well.  It can be a lifesaver
in a cockpit fire.  It's also expensive and getting more so.  However,
if you want to put a fire OUT, you'll have to follow up with a more
residual agent: water, foam, dry chemical.  Or use them the first
time!

Oh, and stay away from extinguishers of any kind that use plastic
valving (ie Kidde).  They don't hold up and they are not refillable.

I carry 10 pounds of ABC drychem in my street 931.  But then, I look
for fires!

"ABC" = mono-ammonium phosphate

Subject: POC Phoenix Report (long)

Or, how I left my impression on PIR...

  On the weekend of February 19th and 20th, the Porsche Owner's Club
held a combination time trial and club race at Phoenix International
raceway's road course under cool but sunny skies.  Present at the
event from porschephiles were Ken Shahoian (taking pictures and
spectating), Barny Bettilyon in his newly-acquired (and very
clean, I might add) 914-6, and Drew Spencer in his RS America.  


  Over 90 registrants participated driving a myriad of Porsches
ranging from a vintage Porsche 907 race car to stock 914's.  The
course layout, for those who are unfamiliar with it, consists of
a road course that weaves its way through the infield of the 

Phoenix oval from the pits and eventually enters the oval in the
middle of the back straight leading to a run through turns 3 and
4 of the oval and 2/3rds the way down the front straight before
making a bumpy left hand turn back into the infield.  This bump
caused alot of problems for people who didn't have their turn-in
completed before hitting it... 


 Each of the four run groups ran 5 20 minute sessions on Saturday
and 3 on Sunday.  Needless to say, there was plenty of time to 

use up brake pads and tires.  Two wheel-to-wheel races were held,
one on Saturday, and the main event Sunday afternoon.  Both races
were dominated by Martin Snow's 934 with second being taken by 

what appeared to be a rocket-powered 914 with plenty of 

dicing going on back in the pack as cars battled for position.  

Watching what is, no doubt, a very valueable 907 dicing with 3.8
RSR-winged RS Americas and 935s was an amazing and satisfying sight.

Due to the mixing of traffic, I didn't get all the finish times and
places, but I'll follow-up later if anybody's interested.  


BTW, To: Ken S.
  I'll let you know about the bumper if it looks like I'll be
replacing it...the rest-of-the-story follows...

 On a personal note, this was my first time-trial and it ended
up being quite an experience.  The first three sessions found 

me matched up with Paul Fairchild (races an SCCA ITS prepared
944) as an instructor.  After coaching me on the race line until
I started getting it right, he turned me loose.  The fourth session
I went out alone and continued to refine the line and added more
speed and eventually lapping around 1:18.5-1:19.0.  For the 5th
session, I added a little more speed (too much) and got the
car upset on the bump entering turn one and ended up spinning through
turn one, across the grass, and up the middle of the turn one 

(oval) banking enough to have the right front of the car tap the wall
before coming to a stop.  Damage was minor (broken headlight, slightly
dinged front fender/front bumper) and after working my way back
down to the paddock, I was reminded by many how lucky I was that I 

didn't catch a wheel where the grass meets the oval or I would have
ended up finding out how effective my roll bar and helmut were.  I'll
be keeping the bent headlight ring as a reminder of the saying (credit to 

the author whose name currently eludes me...) 

"It's better to go in slow and out fast, then in fast and out dead".  


 After taking out the broken lights (kept intact with race tape) and
filling the void with shop rags and taping them over, we pressed on
for Sunday's trial where I turned a 1:18.05.  I don't really know
whether it's good or bad, but it was fast enough for me.  I also want
to give a personal thanks to all those who helped me prepare the car
and kept me informed of what was going on.  Thanks.

Now to get the car fixed and ready for the next event....:-)

In Bruce Anderson's 911 book, he makes note of a Porsche memo where you
fill your 911 tank with gas, add 1 canister of Techron, and then when the
gas tank is 1/2 full, you fill up the tank with gasoline.  

I think either the memo or Techron advises this only once or twice per oil
change.

I think the above is generally agreed upon, but also note that the '77
engines did fix one problem by changing the valve guide material.  This
often caused a much longer lasting engine, and is why the 1977 engines are
probably the most reliable of the 2.7's.

Subject: Halon Break-down

Dear Todd, 
 
You are absolutely right.  The introduction of halons in a fire will produce 
the acids you mentioned, but not by the mechanism you suggest.  In fact, the 
break down of the halon is vital for its fire extinguishing properties.  Halon 
makes an excellent fire retardant because it works in three ways: First, it 
smothers the fire by excluding oxygen.  Second it steals heat from the 
combustion because it comes out of the extinguisher as an aerosol that requires 
heat to fully vaporize.  But thirdly but most important, it chemically quenches 
the actual combustion process. 
 
Halon, CBrClF2 (This is the best I can do for chemical notation in ASCII) 
breaks down to yield bromine radicals (Br).  These will then react with 
hydrogen radicals (H) which are the primary propagators of combustion to yield 
HBr (Hyrdobromic acid).  HBr may then continue to scavenge the H radicals in a 
chain reaction HBr + H -> Br + H2 then Br + H -> HBr.  You are correct that 
this can be corrosive, but only if it comes into contact with water;  all the 
above reactions occur in the gaseous phase.   
 
The solublization of the HBr is unlikely to occur in a burning engine 
compartment, but could be a serious problem if breathed where it comes into to 
contact with the water on the lung's lining leading to pulmonary inflamation.  
Therefore, when using a halon extinguisher, avoid sticking your face into it.  
If you have used a halon fire extinguisher to put out an engine fire, it would 
probably be a good idea to rinse the contacted parts with water with a small 
amount of baking soda. 
 
However, when using this argument with regards to comparing possible future 
damage to an engine, you must remember that you are comparing grams of HBr to 
literally pounds of bicarbonate in dry chemical and water type extinguishers.

On the technical side a number of people suggested a door
re-skin rather than a replacement. Also a number of people
suggested techniques for pulling a dent out by drilling
tiny holes or soldering a temporary lug of sorts onto the 
outside surface and using that to pull the dent out.

Also a number of people suggested defensive parking techniques.
Well, I always park defensively (ie diagonal straddle of two spaces)
except when I park at the back of our London office at the weekends.
I always though "Oh, no need to do that here, It could not possibly

Subject: Re: Changing Coolant in a 944S

Darren,

The instructions in the owner's manual are correct.  You ought to replace
the seal rings (crush washers) on the block drain bolt and the bleeder
at the top of the circuit.

The more-complex 16 valve heads are more prone to trapping pockets of
air than the 8-valvers.  Even after doing a good bleed, it is not
uncommon to see the level drop a little after the first time you drive
the car.

Here's a trick which really helps prime the system.  When you fill it,
do so with the bleed screw open.  Having filled it until the expansion
tank is pretty full, use your mouth over the expansion tank filler to
blow into the system, sort of like you're giving it mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.  Blow till the expansion tank empties, refill then repeat
until you start pushing coolant out the bleeder.  For whatever reason,
this dramatically reduces the amount of bleeding you'll have to do with
the engine running and seems to leave less air trapped in the head.

Subject: Fire Extinguisher rebuttal

Howdy Patty, John, Mike et al. 
 
This is my last comments on the fire extinguishers then I'll shut up. 
 
All seem to be in agreement that an installed fire system is the best.  I have 
to agree.  However, If I recall Patty asked about a fire extinguisher because 
she was going to take up autocrossing, not go for her NASCAR license.  I think 
considering the circumstances, shelling out for a full fire control system is a 
little extreme. 
 
John feels that the dry chemical are better than halon because they are 
persistent, non corrosive and cheaper.  Again I agree.  The pK of ABC dry is 
about 10 (little bit corrosive) and about 6 for purple K (not worth worrying 
about).  However, the powder is abrasive and extremely messy.  If my engine was 
on fire and you came running in with a 10 lbs dry, and another guy came in with 
a 5 lbs halon, seeing as I'm the one who would have to clean it up, I think 
I'll ask the guy with the halon to try first.  And as an aside; if you let one 
of those puppies go in an enclosed space you will experience the joys of acute 
broncial if not pulmonary inflamation first hand.  Trust me. 
 
With regards to spraying carbon dioxide onto a hot engine: in deference to Stan 
I'm not going to go into the mathematics, but a 10 lbs carbon dioxide 
extinguisher has a potential of about 2,000 BTU.  Assuming a 10 sec discharge 
time, 10% transfer of heat (conservative) and that the engine is made out of 
aluminum (I haven't got values for complex alloys), I figure a cooling rate of 
5-10 degrees C per sec depending on the area of the engine covered.  To my 
southern baptist way or thinking, that's a little too fast for an engine at 
race temperatures to cool (without getting into thermal expansions and shear 
stresses). Therefore you could give it a try, but I would think twice about 
putting out my engine fire with CO2. 
 
Now to bring some perspective to my argument.  If this fire was threatening my 
life than all bets are off and you can roll it into the Pacific for all I care. 
But we are talking about autocrossing.  This isn't hit the wall at 140 burst 
into flames kind of racing.  What we're talking about is leaky fuel line 
dripping on the manifolds kind of fires.  I think we have managed with this 
discussion to scare Patty and any other potential autocrosser half to death. 
As has been said, your extinguisher is just the first line of attack.  If you 
can't get the fire out with limited damage and mess, the track crew will be 
there in seconds with the big guns to take care of it.

The engine dies out altogether, until you let off the gas, then it starts

    you're going into the wall, without a doubt, then punch the halon
    dump button NOW-- before you crash, go unconscious, and the fire
    starts."  I realize that you certainly don't imply that if I am a
    half mile back and am being propelled uncontrollably toward a wall
    that I immediately hit the button now but that I do it some time
    closer to impact.  My question is, isn't it possible to hit the
    button too soon, spend all the halon (after all, there probably
    isn't more than 10 seconds worth) and then have a fire start?
    Will the halon remain effective against fire after it has been
    discharged (i.e., is there any residue left behind that will
    hinder the fire, or is it just a "vapor/gas" that is effective
    only when being discharged)?   Thanks in advance for any comments.

Subject: Techron



Back when I used to work for Amoco Research, our petro
engineers were playing around with some very interesting 
polymer additives that would really clean up an engine in
sufficient quantity. (Chevron gas had the highest
concentration at the time)

I took a look at some fuel injection cleaner last week
and it said "contains naphtha and petroleum distillates"
Naphtha is basically lighter fluid and you can buy it by
the gallon for about 8 bucks. 

It got me thinking. Do we have any petrochemical engineers
out there that know what is in Techron that makes it so
special? It's recommended by Porsche, Mercedes, BMW etc.
so I'm assuming that there's more to it than repackaged
bulk chemicals and a patented name.

Just curious,

Now you did it Magnus! our VP, Al Gore, is on the internet

Seriously, what's the invironmental impact of Halon if left

Subject: 911 clutch

    Good Morning Porsche Fans-

    A recent thread on the net has sparked in my memory a problem I
    was experiencing with my 1971 911 before I put it into hybernation
    for the winter.  With the motor idling, whenever I put the
    transmission in neutral, and let the clutch out all the way (as
    you would while sitting at a red light), I would hear a
    faint thump, thump, thump, thump coming from presumably somewhere
    behind me.  I adjusted the clutch cable at the transmission
    (mine is a 911 transmission, not a 901 nor a 915) but the problem
    persisted.  Is it possible that the clutch cable needs to be
    adjusted at the pedal end?  The cable was replaced a few hundred
    miles after I rebuilt the engine and installed a new T/O
    bearing disc and plate (well under 5,000 miles on the whole
    system, so I doubt [hopefully] that the clutch is worn out
    yet).  Any ideas.  Thanks in advance for your help.

I got one day turn from Reno thru the local dealer here for about $30.
fortunately I did have the original key paperwork with #'s.  Did opt later

The valet key will not disarm the factory alarm system and I think it may 
not unlock the glovebox for what peace of mind that is.  So it make sense 
if you have to leave a key with anyone other than family leave them the 
valet key.    I guess if you don't have fac alarm, you're only protecting 
the chocolates cooling in the glovebox.

Subject: An interesting article about Tires on Acura NSX


I've heard this one since almost day one - I think it has a lot to do 
with the drivers and driving style as well.  Given the tire-wear rating 
on the tire which I believe is in the 110-120 range, I would not expect 
more that 12000 miles on the tire.  I've worn out 170 rated tires in 
20,000 miles and 310 rated tires in 25,000 miles.  But I do admit to 
being more agressive than the average - even in the wagon (with the 310 
rated Goodyear Eagle GA's).

I would also hypothize that the average NSX driver (despite being able 
to afford the car), is not Prost or Senna in terms of preserving tires 
 - in fact it would be interesting to see how long the tires last on 
Senna's NSX.  However, your average Porsche driver is probably more 
skilled - but that was Honda's intent as far as audience (the less 
skilled drivers?)  for the NSX.  BTW, how long does the average tire 
last on a Porsche C2 or C4 anyway?

I know someone who put the same A022 tires on a 1990 Integra and he got 
20,000 miles on them.  My brother has RE71's on his Civic Si with a 140 
rating and he will be replacing them after about 20,000 miles.

When I asked PCNA customer service about fuel injector cleaners for my 86 911,
I was told to use a product called VG-44K (any one heard of it ?) once every
50K miles. Its an intensive cleaning product, not for maintainance like Techron.I was advised to change oil after running VG-44K through the system. Also,
PCNA said that Chevron Super Unleaded containes Techron as an additive,
but I am not sure in what concentration.

I have not yet used VG-44K since I am not yet due for an oil change. If anyone

Mike,

Although I drive a 'bubbler' 951, I will gladly share my experience.

Replaced my factory Boge sport shocks with Koni Gas Adjustable Sport models
(the yellow ones, not the red). Totally awesome. Especially on the track.
MUCH better feel and control (the orig shocks were not worn out) and when
commuting to the track, the ability to dial the fronts quickly to 'soft'
makes the drives much more fun (6-7 hours to Watkins Glen from here in
Burlington, VT area).

With experimentation, I find about 3/4 firm is just right for the Glen; just
the right combination of stiffness and feel with a bit of compliance to keep
the tires in contact with the asphalt!

Best of luck...and tell us what your experience is with the new hardware!

I believe the a002 is a hard compound tire, more like the a008 than 
a008rs.

Accura put them on to give the car very high "stock" skid pad figures.

How fast would you like me to wear out your tires?  Now, lets speculate

Many law enforcement agencies are going to higher frequency systems, some
up in the 800mhz band.  Repeaters are required at these high frequencies
and the easy way to deploy them is to put them in the cars.  Over the next
few years such systems will become the industry standard.  That's good
news if you want your "bear" tracker to pick up a signal.  But its bad
news because it probably picks up everything in the band, including DOT,
taxis and a lot of other junk.   So if you want to slow down for anything
with a two-way radio system using repeaters it should work just fine :-).

Subject: Dent in 911 Door

Hi, Erich.
 
Find another shop. The one you went to just wants to take you for the
maximum amount of money possible.
 
You're in England, right? England has a long tradition of panelbeaters who
can make or fix anything.
 
Not knowing how bad the dent is, there are several possibilities. Here in
the U.S. there are various franchises and services going under the name of
"Dr. Dent" and the like, who claim "paintless dent removal." They can work
wonders on small dents. I witnessed a demonstration for the Porsche Club in
San Diego last week, at "Just Dents." There is no secret. They just use
steel rods, bent to fit each particular situation right on the spot. The
rods usually have a blunt tip. The tip is placed on the deepest part of the
dent and the operator just gradually teases the dent out. We absolutely
could not find the two dents repaired at the demonstration, even though they
were marked beforehand and we watched as they magically disappeared. And
yes, one was slightly masked by the door intrusion beam, as yours is.
(That's were most dents will occur anyway, and these shops specialize in
taking them out.) Note that the door beam does not touch the door skin;
there is about a 1/4 inch gap, filled by rubbery goo. A good repairman,
whether using the "Dr. Dent" method or a conventional body spoon, can indeed
work behind there. (But it's easier and more lucrative to sell the customer
a new door.) Actual time pushing out the dents was about a minute a dent,
not counting time to disassemble the inner door panel. Cost, minimum $75 per
panel, this job may have cost about $100 for the two dents. As the paint was
not broken, the door again appears perfect.
 
Now, conventional methods. If the metal is extensively stretched (i.e. more
than just a dimple caused by another door) the repair will require some
hammer and dolly work, and possibly some leading later, followed by repaint.
Repaint is a repaint -- unless you have a very good painter with a very good
eye for color and it's one of his better days and he takes time to blend the
repair into the surrounding panels and depending on your color,
either it doesn't match now, or it won't match a year from now.
 
And if for some reason the backside of the dent is indeed not accessible, a
well-equipped body shop will have an electric spot welder known as a
"panelspotter" or similar, with an attachment for welding a steel washer to
the panel. A hook is then inserted in the washer and tugged (gently, Igor!)
to tease the panel out. It will take several washers and lots of tugging,
but you can ease the crease right back out. The washers are then twisted off
(the weld is not that strong) and the remaining weld ground off. A similar
method involves welding nail-like things and tugging on those.
 
The thing you DON'T want to do is fill the dent with plastic, sand, and
paint. Plastic has one purpose only -- achieving a final smooth finish. It's
not intended to build up highly deformed areas, only to even small
irregularities. Plastic STILL has a lot of long-term problems when used in
thick layers. Lead, surprisingly, has long-term problems too, of a sort --
after 30 years, the acid can sneak to the surface. I found bubbles in the
leaded areas of my 356, with its 30-year-old paint.
 
By far the most desirable method is to have one of the paintless dent
removal people do it. They may appear to charge a great deal for what
amounts to a minute worth of work, but it's well worth it. First, you
haven't bashed away at the door, or leaded it, or filled it. Second, you
don't need a complete repaint. If there is only a small paint defect, that
can be repaired to be invisible with your touch-up paint, fine sandpaper,
and several days and several applications of the paint.
 
Also, the recommendation to park far away from other cars and take up two
spaces isn't always such a good idea. Some people will immediately take
objection to "another Porsche a--hole" taking up two spaces, and lovingly
take a key to both sides of the car. That complete repaint will cost more
than your dent. But then, you can be sure of a good color match. :-)

Subject: POC races, another perspective

Well, I made it back to the home front, too.

Always good to see familiar faces and meet some new folks (like Drew).  Just
to add some things everyone may or may not be interested in:

1.  Video of Saturday's race available

I put a camera in Monte Smith's RS America (now RSR bodied), and got some
great in-car.  He started in the pack (they drew numbers for race 1 starting
positions) and charged up to the front.  I also shot from in the stands, so
I'm going to make a feeble attempt at editing something.  I'll make copies
for the price of a tape and postage, let me know!  I lost track of time and
missed getting the camera in for race 2.

Also, some in-car from my friend Mark Manda's 935 (started life as '66 911,
but has factory 935 engine now).  A really violent ride compared to Monte's,
and he ran 1:05.25, compared to Martin Snow's 1:04.7.  On old junky tires,
too!

2.  Time Trials, SoCal style

Compared to my run at PIR last Oct. (38 total entries), the red run group was
pretty wild.  Almost everyone was in the 1:09 to 1:12 range:  914-6, 911's
(3.0 to 3.6), even a 951.  Made for a good show just watching the practice
sessions.  Also great to see the level of driving because they basically
allow open passing in the red group.  Motivates me to get the last few things
done on my car.

2.  Drew's fun

He didn't mention it, but Drew was up in the wall very near where Mansell did
himself in last year.  I almost got in on tape, too!  It could've been so
much worse.  Oh, and it was good to see Nigel last Friday playing golf in the
Bob Hope.  Followed his group for awhile at Bermuda Dunes; a whole different
perspective from seeing him at the track.  So relaxed.  Hits a good ball,
too!  I doubt anyone there even knew who he was.  There were about 10 of us
in his gallery.

3.  Fun away from the track

A friend I hadn't seen in a year cruises out Sat. on his Ducati.  He invites
me over for Sun. night and when I get there he tosses me the keys to his one
"toy" car and hops in the other.  He wants to see how they compare, and he
hasn't had anyone else around that he trusts running them flat out with.  I
got the 348 first, then he turned the Testarossa over to me.  Not user
friendly like a 911, but the TR was easier since I'd driven one.  The 348
really surprised me.  He runs it in open track events and the Virginia City
Hillclimb, so he wanted my impression.  I'll stick to the 911's, I told him
(cost reasons).

Subject: 911 clutch


    A recent thread on the net has sparked in my memory a problem I
    was experiencing with my 1971 911 before I put it into hybernation
    for the winter.  With the motor idling, whenever I put the
    transmission in neutral, and let the clutch out all the way (as
    you would while sitting at a red light), I would hear a
    faint thump, thump, thump, thump coming from presumably somewhere
    behind me.  I adjusted the clutch cable at the transmission
    (mine is a 911 transmission, not a 901 nor a 915) but the problem
    persisted.  Is it possible that the clutch cable needs to be
    adjusted at the pedal end?  The cable was replaced a few hundred
    miles after I rebuilt the engine and installed a new T/O
    bearing disc and plate (well under 5,000 miles on the whole
    system, so I doubt [hopefully] that the clutch is worn out
    yet).  Any ideas.  Thanks in advance for your help.

Steve, assuming you have the original pull type clutch, it sounds like
a pedal travel problem which is causing the fork to touch the fingers
of the pressure plate. You must try to limit the pedal travel by
adjusting the plastic stop on the floorboard. Do not allow this to
continue, it is obviously very bad.

Subject: Re: Acura NSX article in New York Times

Someone here in Porschephiles put a message in about the article in the
New York Times, I think 2/22. While I also agree that it was rather silly
of Acura/Honda to choose such a soft tire as standard equipment, I think
it does reflect on the owner's common sense to drive any car, especially
in the rain with bald tires. Doesn't he/she have the sense to check the
tires every now and then? Especially with such an expensive car, I
wouldn't take the risk of driving with inadequate tires.
I think it's also silly to sue the company just because the tires wore
out too quickly. I've read a lot of articles on similar cars wearing out
their tires just as quickly, namely the 300ZX turbo and the RX-7. Why
don't the owners of these cars sue the respectives companies too?
I apologize for the irrelevent subject matter, I thought it was an
interesting point though. --

Subject: An interesting article about Tires on Acura NSX


I am not a subscriber but just heard from my friend.

   NSX owners.  It seems they are routinely wearing out their rear
   tires at less than 10,000 miles.  Some of these owners are lawyers,
   and naturally, they are suing Acura, Honda, the dealers, etc.  One
   guy wants a refund on his whole car.

It is incredible but true that NSX eats tires like erasers.
Honda is naive and the lawyers crazy!

   The tire in question is the Yoko A022. They rarely seem to last
   10,000 miles, often 5000, and one car which crashed had bald rear
   tires after 3000 miles!

From my experience, rear tires should replaced before 10000kms(not miles!),
5000kms better and must for hot-rodders.
You may read these figures by mile
because tires sold in US have hard compounds and thus live longer.

   My impression: Acura is fitting a very foolish tire to this car. I don't
   know any specs on the A022, but it sounds like it may be like the
   A008RS, which wears out very quickly, and is ridiculous to put on a
   street car for street use.

I guess it is hard compound version of Yokokama ADVAN A08
(or somthing different figures) came with NSX as specially designed tire. 
Its dry grip is the best among 3 authorized brands but weakest on wet road.
Plus wears quicker than others.
These facts imply that american lawyers will soon to be half in population.

It is not only the tires that is ill designed but the geometry of 
the rear tires are still not sophisticated.
It is not so remarkable for the car of that performance and of exotic.
The bad thing for Honda is NSX is too easy and comfort in every other respect.

I already tried other(Dunlop Performa8000) but it wears so quick too.
Now I chose Bridgeston RE010 with last hope(but little).
Also, 
I would like to rearange the suspension geometry as recent revised versions.

I would remark that front tires should be checke more carefully.
It only last twice as long but you may not realize 
because they wear only insides for strong - camber.
Rears wears equally resulted from toe-in angle.

In fact, tires must not to be abused.
Honda designed the car too depending on 
contemporary high performance tires.
It should be noted that NSX put the smallest tires among the range.
Therfore, tires are not super expensive as those for comtemporary 911's.
Also this might be one of the reason for good mpg figure which is very
important here in Japan.

	Well guys, I have purchased my first Porsche. It is an 84 Carrera Targa
Oyster shell blue/blue. European car with 82k miles documentd. Has Turbo rims
and new Yok tires, No CC.  AC, original radio that works well, Almost no rust
to speak of, very good to excellent condition, I am the 2nd owner realistically
speaking since the last owner had it for two months and put on it about 200 
miles before losing his job(unfortunate). New clutch about 200 miles ago, No oil
leaks to speak off,drives very well indeed and feels very smooth and suprisingly
quiet for a targa. The top is in super shape, the seals are tight and do not 
leak since I picked it up when we had lots of rain in Northern CAL. Brakes are
excellent. Hood shock are dead as usaual, main shocks may need replacement in
a few month to a year. 
I checked all the Federal and state agencies for legality and it checked perfect
and passed the smog. The car has all the US requirements, as a matter of fact
you can not tell if it was not for the non us title.
It weighs 2600 lbs and has higher gears and seems to like fifth at about 70 mph.

I am very happy with it so far and since it needs nothing at this time ...

I want to thank all of you who helped especially Carl Desousa for his time and
effort.


Now the questions is: Do I keep my 89 Supra Turbo which I still love and work
to pay for both of them and the insurance?

This sounds like the product the Volvo dealer used to solve a recurring

I've seen several stories about Haltech systems.  They offer easy programming

I'm running subject device in my 78 911SC. Made a bracket for it that

set the scanner up for the state you are in, Indiana in my case. You have
four choices of frequenices; state/highway patrol, city type police, DOT
and National Weather Service. Does it work -- yes, but. The range is so
good, i.e., it picks up signals way out there, like 10-16 miles, that
you get tired of looking for the source. I tend to speed up and then find
the source. Also, it doesn't pick up ALL enforcement vehicles. I generally
Porsche to the office via an interstate. It picks up weights and measure
vehicles just about everytime. It does not do well against sheriff type
vehicles etc.

Interestingly enough, since the weather tends to be foul in the winter
in Central Indiana, I use the National Weather Service daily.

Lastly, you can turn the volume down and not listen to the traffic. The
device will loudly beep and flash red at you if it picks up a frequency
band you have selected. 

Is it worth the $150.00 I paid for it....Time will tell.

I had a very interesting talk with Mark Richter, one of the Yokohama
"Specialty and Performance Tire Ambassadors" on the A022 a few years
ago, when they were *only* available as OEM and repalcement tires for 
the NSX. (they are now available in other sizes, too).

This tire was *specificly* engineered for the NSX, in terms of roll
characteristics, adhesion, rolling resistance, and a whole pile
of other stuff. Unlike the 008s where you have A's and B's, initially
this tire was even *corner specific* (I think that's changed now).
They are basicly racing tires, with a DOT sticker. They are *supposed*
to get about 6000 miles if you drive hard, and maybe a little more if 
you just motor around.

An NSX, in stock trim, is capable of things rapidly approaching IMSA
GTP Lights cars do in terms of handling, top speed, etc. So, from
a "reasonableness" point of view, which is the best solution: put
a tire on the car that is capable of handling anything you might chose
to do with it, or put on a tire that will give decent performance as
long as you stay at/under the speed limit but have really good tread
life???

I say that since the NSX is basicly a race car with a "street legal"
sticker on it, that race tires with a "street legal" sticker
are completely appropriate.

Otherwise, Acura could be getting sued by someone who slid their car
off the road trying to corner at 1 G on Flintstone tires.

Kevin is right though -- this shows massively stupid behaviour on
the part of the car owners. It's a sports car. It's a *HIGH END*
sports car. You *expect* to buy tires yearly for those. Or you
should.

Oh, my one and only up-close-and-personal encounter with an NSX came
when a friend swapped cars with me  for a weekend. Why? Well, he was
going to this state bar convention and couldn't get his golf clubs
and his girlfriend in the NSX and both fit fine in my 911... Good
thing he sold the car shortly thereafter, or I'd expect to see his
name on that suit as one of the plaintifs....

And no, it wasn't *THAT* impressive. No character. Just cold, 
solid performance.

Anthony,

Sounds like a bad CV joint or a bad wheel bearing.  You can generally
figure out which side it's on by loading up that side as you drive down
the road, swerving first left then right.  The loaded side is the sick
one, 95% of the time.

You can check for a bad CV joint sorta kinda by grabbing the half shaft
and trying to turn it, feeling for play or other weirdness.  Best done
with the car jacked.  If you haven't repacked the CV's in 30K miles,
you ought to take them apart anyways to look for wear, then repack.

With the car jack and the transmission in neutral, you can spin each
rear wheel and listen for noise or unevenness as a sign confirming a
bad rear wheel bearing.  Of course, if you can actually feel play in
the bearing, by rocking the wheel, the bearing's definitely smoked.

I have had one for a year or more and put on about 20,000 miles in most of
the western states in my 964 with the BearTracker running. Basically it is
a preprogrammed scanner plus a special 'Mobex" frequency detector. The
scanner works OK *but* the mobex is a disappointment. Mobex is the little
trooper's belt transceivers which use a secondary transmitter in the car to
maintain commmunications between the trooper and dispatch when out of the
car. That's where you see the microphone on the front of the uniform. Most
units disconnect automatically when Officer Bob gets back in the car. Many
states warn the troopers to shut 'em off when in the car (exception - CA
where they leave 'em on for unforseen emergency exits).

Sooo... while the technology works, this is not a dependable early warning
system. Much better to use a reliable radar detector and spend the money on
the new Yupiteri scanners which can pull all the C.B. channels as well as
scan the appropriate police frequencies and *are* programmable. -ken-

Subject: clunking noise on 1979 930

    To the netter with the clunking noise problem-

    Sounds like your BALL JOINTS are shot (these are the units that
    connect the shock to the A arms).  You can make sure it is a
    faulty ball joint (as should everyone periodically do this check)
    by jacking up the front of the car and shaking the wheel
    back/forth and up/down (you are not looking for wheel bearing play
    here, but play in the ball joint).  If it clunks, or is loose at
    all at the joint, replace it/them.  The joints are fairly
    inexspensive (around $40 if I remember correctly) escpecially
    considering how important they are, and fairly easy to change.

    Good Luck and I hope this helps.

 Hola amigos

I am about to do some work on my 1600 Normal engine for my '58 coupe.
Well,...actually it is going to be overhauled.
I wonder.....which dimensions are the most critical when measuring
cylinders??
Which dimensions are specified as wear limits??

I am not sure whether the cylinders are useable but it wouldn't bother
me if they were.
There is so to say no edges in the cylinders and they look very good.

I also have a problem in splitting the case, any 'secrets'?

It is high time start thinking 'bout the engine now as the chassi
rebuilld is progressing every day (night). Most of my interior for
this car is at the upholsterer and I'm pretty sure he has a nice bill
for me in a week or two.

I'm already starting to think about the restoration of my '60 Super
coupe, and I have to look around for a restorable front clip and
fenders for it. New items are possible but T-5 panels is *bloody*
expensive when it comes to these panels.

Any sources???

cheers,
trond

Could be a number of things.  Have you checked the bushings on your front sway

Subject: RE: Dent in 911 Door


I  agree with Pete, that while I sympathize with Ben's desire to avoid dings 
from inconsiderate idiots, parking diagonally across two spaces is very 
inconsiderate when parking spaces are at a premium (which they usually are 
in the U.K.) Parking in this fashion really takes up three spaces because 
the method also cuts off the space next to the two you occupy in order for 
you to get in and out. Noboby is going to want to park across the end of 
your car and risk you clipping them as you negotiate you way back out of the 
space.
 ----------

Also, the recommendation to park far away from other cars and take up two
spaces isn't always such a good idea. Some people will immediately take
objection to "another Porsche a--hole" taking up two spaces, and lovingly
take a key to both sides of the car. That complete repaint will cost more
than your dent. But then, you can be sure of a good color match. :-)

Subject: "Bear Tracker" (for sale)


I've had one in my car for a while, and I only use it on trips outside the
city.  For trips between Boston and NYC, its "bear tracking" ability is
limited because of too many false signals.  I think one can play with the
squelch control to fix this, but I have not really tried.

However, it can be useful in more remote areas where there are not so many
false signals.  Since I don't do that too often, I can't justify keeping the
device.  

The main value the device has had for me is entertainment on long rides.
You get to hear troopers calling in info for cars they've caught speeding
(no they have not gotten me lately), and you can listen in on local police.
The weather band capability can be very valuable, but my stock radio already
has that.  

The device's main negative value is that it drives my wife crazy.  It can
really increase the level of paranoia one has when driving above the speed
limit.  The combination of trooper and police talk, and a new set of beeps,
along with the noises coming from the radar detector are just too much for
her!  Sitting in the passenger seat is supposed to be soothing, right! :-)

So, I'd like to sell my unit for a reasonable price.  Please send me your
offer.  No offer is too low since I can't keep it, though I will of course
pick the highest one I receive.  By the way, I paid about $140 for it.

        Reply to:   RE>Oil for 911's
Dan -

There is no problem with going back and forth from synthetics to
non-synthetics.  But it's probably easier on your memory and budget
if you buy one type in quantity and use it always.  One of the very
best non-synthetic oils is Shell's Rotella T.  It is a diesel-grade oil
that sustains high temperatures very well and is popular with a lot
of Porsche mechanics.  Many insist on it for 930's.  It is hard to come
by but if you are near one of those large truck-stop service stations
you can usually pick it up there.

In my BMW I use Castrol's synthetic, 5W-50.  Very happy with it.
But I only go with Rotella T for my two Carreras.

BTW, the only advantage to a synthetic is that it doesn't breakdown
as easily.  It still gets dirty just as quickly and you should change
oil & filter at regular intervals regardless (ie, 3k miles).

This also has me concerned. Since New Jersey is one of the areas with
permission to use oxygenated fuel year-round, and Houston is on the

I used to run methanol dragster motors, but that's like way different

alcohol running through it....

So, anyone out there knnow for sure how this is going to affect our
older cars? On the models with carbs, you can jack with jetting to keep

(strictly for off-road racing applications, understand... 8{P). Do we

Subject: Collier Auto Museum

Porschephiles in or around Florida might be interested in visiting
the Collier Automotive Museum in Naples, Florida before it closes
permanently in April.  The owner (whose family was associated with
Briggs Cunningham's racing efforts) is closing this fine racing
(predominately) museum because he can no longer write off the
losses on his taxes (fifth year of operation at a loss for you
accountants out there).  The museum's number is (813) 643-5252.

I feel particularly sorry for the senior citizen docents working
there who planned on structuring their retirements around
volunteering for the museum.  (Incidentally, it was quite
refreshing after a week in Naples to hear 70+ year olds in
conversation with each other, not about the weather, but about the
sports cars they had owned including XKE's, TR's, and Austin
Healys!).

They claim to have the best racing Porsche collection outside of
Germany, and I'm inclined to believe them:
     '29 Mercedes SSK 38/250 (designed by Herr Doktor Porsche)
     '48 356 SL Gmund Coupe
     '56 550A Spyder
     '58 GT Carrera Speedster
     '58 RSK Spyder
     '60 Abarth-Carrera GTL
     '60 RS-60 Spyder
     '63 Elva Porsche
     '64 904 Carrera GTS
     '66 906
     '67 910/6
     '68 911R
     '69 908LH
     '69 917PA Can-Am
     '70 914/6 GT
     '70 917K
     '71 908/3 Spyder
     '85 962
     '86 962C GTP
     '80 928 (matchbox for sale in gift shop)

They have a number of other racers too (including most of the
Cunningham racers and a D-type Jag) and a few passenger cars.  The
museum is somewhat unique in that it tries to enter its cars in
vintage races.  

They charge $6.00 per adult, and the museum's number is (813) 643-
5252.  It really is sad to see such a historic grouping broken up.

There was a lengthy article on this subject in PANO in NOV or DEC.  My
brother-in-law bought my old 911 and has it in Portland, where all
gas is gasohol in the winter, so I took note.  The big problem is not
the mixture so much as the alcohol's affinity for water and its
solvent properties.  It drags the water in your gas tank through
your fuel injection system, corroding it along the way.  Its solvent
properties tend to negate the lubricating properties of engine oil and
gasoline.  The cure is a fuel additive (503?) mentioned in the article.

Bob,

I used to fly to our summer house south of Plattsburgh.  Burlington is
the major airport.  From it, you can take a ferry across to New York,
either from Burlington to Port Kent, or from Charlotte south of
Burlington to Essex.  The former takes about an hour, the latter about
twenty minutes.

You can also drive your way around by going north of Burlington a bit.
Long trip; did it once when we drove into Burlington too late for the
ferry.

There is a shuttle plane from Burlington to Plattsburgh's tiny commercial
airport.  I took it once, and it was really neat.  They use a small plane,
and it flys pretty low over Lake Champlain and so forth.

Assuming you're planning to rent a car, I think your best plan would be
to pick it up at the Burlington airport and drive it across via the
Burlington-Port Kent ferry.  If you and your wife have the time and
inclination, you might enjoy doing a little shopping/strolling in
Burlington before heading across the lake, or taking a side trip to
some of the surrounding Vermont sights.

Beran,

The MY88 944 Turbo S said "Turbo S" in the rear model designation.  I
think it was also option coded M758, which you should be able to see
on the build sticker underneath the rear carpet over the spare tire.

Avoid the 17" rims, it's hard to get good track tires for them.  With
respect to the car's handling, I always suggest (preach) that you ought
to first learn to drive the car you have, which S or not is a wonderful
car!  Street tires and bone-stock suspension will telegraph what the
car's doing much better, and you'll learn faster than someone who first
built a monster for himself or herself.

Congrats on the purchase, and hope to meet you at the track this season.
Get out there and DO IT!

I would probably put things a little differently.  If you otherwise do
not change a factory engine, adding a Haltech system to a late factory
car will yield little or no performance improvement.

If, however, you build an engine which is substantially different from
a factory engine, you'll need an engine management system, and the Haltech
(or something like it) is the only way you can roll your own engine
management system.  However, I would point out that in its first year, we
ran our 911 race car with a radical 2.7 litre engine and a Motronic box out
of a 3.2 litre Carrera.  It worked.

I would not attempt to program one of these systems without a dyno and
a wide-range lambda sensor gas analyzer, having done a couple.  I am sure
folks have programmed them without the latter, bless them, but I think
it would be substantially more difficult.  Even after setting it all up
with the dyno, you need to drive the car on the street with the analyzer
and fine tune.

One solution, of course, is to buy a finished product, ie, engine (kit)
plus ECU.  There are a number of folks who sell this sort of thing.

I would not assume you need to change the induction or injectors, a priori.
Regarding the latter, the only reason to change them is that your
current ones cannot flow enough fuel, which is not necessarily a valid
assumption.

    Thank you for the posting re Collier's museum.  I have heard of

    (despite the fact that I visit South Florida about 3 or 4 times a

    On the subject of Porsches and museums, before I went to Germany
    last year I wanted to know all "Porsche" things to do there,
    including mesuems, so I did a little investigating and came up
    with a list.  Now, here I am with a great collection like
    Collier's virtually at my door step that I have not taken
    advantagae of because I never asked about it (and, indeed, might
    miss out on if I don't get my butt back down there before they
    close).

    I have heard of at least one other collection worth seeing here in
    the States (I can't remember the name, but it was featured in an
    article in Excellence in the past couple of months and is in
    California- but is only open to group tours).

    What are some other Porsche collections here in the United States

I bought the "Porsche 911 Video Manual" by Peter Allen Productions last year.
It's OK. It covers pretty basic stuff- location of engine components,
maintenance (replacing fan belt, wheel bearing adjustment), oil change,
transmission oil check, spark plugs and compression, timing (static, dwell,
strobe), valve adjustment, fuel system, engine removal procedure. It's in
standard VHS format, 60 minutes in length.

It was useful for me at the time, as I had just purchased my '85 Carrera.
I've sort of "outgrown" it now. However, it's still more interesting than
most of the shows on network TV. Refreshingly, it does NOT cover Tonya or
Nancy :-).

It cost me $40 from Automotion. If anyone would like to buy it for
half price drop me a line.

I also thoroughly enjoyed the Collier Auto Museum
in Naples Fla. I had the added advantage of taking
my 70+ year old widowed mom with me, and we had a
2 hour personal guided tour by the 70+ year old 
docent who was a very knowledgable Porsche enthusiast.
I really enjoyed seeing 917 engines and some 
incredible racers of all vintages.

The only negative was that the place is somewhat dim
and no cameras are allowed. Since we weren't looking
at priceless works of art (ok, that's disputable) 
I didn't think UV light was as much of an issue as 
the need to hide minor flaws in restoration. After
all, these are racing cars - a few stone chips here
and there wouldn't have bothered me a bit.

I'm sorry to se the museum go, but Collier has also
been involved in vintage racing, so maybe we'll get
to see some of the cars on the track some day.

even talk about emission testing here, let alone
fanct things like oxygenated fuels and God forbid,
"catalytic converters".  Shoot, the rule here is
as long as it has four tires(inflation optional)

     I read ( I think in Panorama) that the alcohol-based
oxengenated fuels are particularly bad for CIS cars (like mine).
The problem is two-fold, moisture in the system, and reduced
lubricity resulting in increased wear rate in the injection
system.  If you run the fuel through rapidly before it picks much
moisture, one problem is reduced, not the other.

     Fuel dryers are just more alcohol, which adds to the problem
for these cars.

Greetings Everyone,

While the subject of oxygenated fuels is on everyones mind, I have a question
for those unfortunates forced to use it. Are the pumps marked in any way? 

What I would like to know is whether there is any means to identify stations
that sell this concoction without calling the companys public relations people.

At the moment I believe (from PANO) that Provo, Utah uses oxygenated fuel but
Salt Lake City does not. Some stations here in Salt Lake have increased the
octane rating of premium gas by 1, so I assume that these places are selling
oxygenated fuel.

Anyone out there know the rules here?

Subject: RE: 951 to an S (Beran Peter)

Beran,
	Lots of differences between a 951 & a 951 S. From the inside the S 
has twin air bags, an equalizer,and a bunch of speakers The good stuff's 
under the car, though. The S has front adjustable Konis with adjustable 
spring plates, bigger F & R sway bars,stiffer springs, std. limited slip, 
ABS and the bigger front calipers/rotors from the 928S4. Engine hp is 247 
vs. 217 for the regular '88 951. Wheels on the S are 7"X16" fronts with 
approx. 55mm offset, rears are 9"X16" w/ 60mm offset.
	Can you upgrade to make an S? Sure, but as one sage on this net is 
always saying - speed costs money. How fast do you want to go?
	If PCA Club Racing is your goal, I'm not sure it's worth it. One of 
the best parts of the S pkg is the front brakes. These can be put on your 
'88 with a kit that Andial, and probably others, sell. But that change 
would bump you from F stock to E. If you do bump up to E, Club Racing rules 
would allow you to change the DME chip but you couldn't change the KLR chip 
or do anything else to raise the boost. I don't know how much higher hp is 
possible with just a DME chip change (does anybody out there?), but you'd 
have to get it up to 239 to have the same weight to power ratio as an S. 
(Min. weight for '88 951 is 2899# and for an S it's 2998#)
	If you forget the big brakes, you can stay in F, leave the engine 
as is, but put in all the suspension goodies. All the S stuff- shocks, sway 
bars,springs, bushings-bolt right in. You can buy em new or perhaps get 
lucky at one of the Porsche parts recyclers. Or you can go further with 
both Porsche parts or aftermarket. These 951s raced in Turbo Cup series 
both in Europe and North America. For these cars Porsche had some very 
aggressive suspension components. There's still spares of this stuff 
available, but it'll take some searching on your part. This stuff also 
bolts in, but if you go this far you will not have a very comfortable 
street car.
	Wheels get tricky because of differing wheel offsets. Club Racing 
rules allow 1" wider than stock rims and any diameter as long as the 
rolling radius w/ tire is not reduced more than 3%. The above mentioned 
Turbo Cup cars use 8" wide fronts and 9" wide rears. This is definitely the 
combination I would recommend. If the 17" wheels you mentioned are these 
widths and have the right offset to fit, take em. I have not seen anyone in 
club racing using P007s so you might have to be careful with those tires.
	If your car doesn't have a LSD, you should consider getting one as 
this is a big improvement for track events. If you stay in F, you can only 
use a factory LSD. If you bump to E, you can use a Quaiffe unit, but I did 
hear some negative feedback about Quaiffes in 951s last year.	
	Hopefully, these are the kinds of comments you were looking for. 
You'll have fun with the car no matter what you do or don't do!

On to important matters....

This weeks Autoweek has a list of who is using ethanol enhanced gas.

As far as earlier comments on gas driers, I thought these were all
alcohol based.

Gas stations are required to state the percentage and type of
alcohol used on the pumps.

Re: Oxygenated fuel

Here in Colorado along the Front Range we have been using
Ethanol fuels for several years now.

During the high pollution months of approx. Nov.-Mar. All
stations sell Oxygenated fuel. The pumps around here are labeled
"MTBE 8%" I think that's what they say. MTBE is some form of Ethanol
mixture I don't know the exact make-up.

Since I have had my 911 since Nov. and it has been running fine,
I can't say whether it has made any difference. But with my previous
cars VW's GTI and Scirroco I never noticed any difference when the
stations changed over to MTBE. Also I don't hear anyone complain.

Excerpt From MArch Issue of Sportscar Magazine:
MTBE = Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether
"has been added to replace some of the octane lost with the departure of 
lead additives. These oxygen bearing compounds have an addtional benefit 
as they tend to reduce CO emmissions when used in about 10% concentrations.
Certain regions are now requiring these compounds to meet CO emmision goals.

Since ethers deliver more oxygen to the combustion chambers, jetting may 
need to be increased. However beyond the 10-15% range ethers tend to 
loose their benefits, as too much can cause flat spots in acceleration.

For what it's worth....

Subject: race tape--PIR Feb. 19

The tape is done, don't expect network quality, but I think it's very
"viewable."  This is what I've done:

1.  The Sat. race from the perspective of Monte Smith, #48.

Starting postions were done by drawing numbers, so there is no "order" to
things.  You'll see who's faster and who's slower.  Monte is now running the
car in the 1:09.5 range.  That is about 3 secs. faster than when we ran last
Oct.  This RS America has been modified extensively over the winter:  Zytek
engine system w/ individual throttle body intake, carbon bodywork to RSR 3.8
specs, 315/35-17 tires on the back, 2580 lb. weight.

2.  In-car 935 of Mark Manda, #20 (2 practice sessions on Sat.)

Note a couple of things:  1.  his first time at the track, and only third
time he's driven this car at speed,  2. the clutch on his car didn't work
(you'll hear it rev wildly whenever he tried to use full throttle) so it was
really hard for him to pass some of the cars,   2. the red car w/ the IROC
wing he can't get around (has a Bob Holcomb super high ouput engine, but note
the lap times--1:18, 3 sec. slower than I ran w/ my near stock SC  3. how
fast Martin Snow shoots past at one point, but Mark came a long way in a
short time--in timed runs Snow ran 1:04.7 and Mark got a 1:05.2  4.  me--pit
stop at 28:20 into the tape, I'm in the gray sweatshirt.

3.  Raw footage of race from the stands.

4.  Raw footage on Monte's in-car

5.  (optional)  misc. video from turn one area Sat./Sun

6.  (optional)  in-car of my run last Oct.

I've got orders for 12 of these, more are welcome.  I'll try to send them by
Wed.or Thurs.  Cost is going to break the bank, I guess:  $8 will cover it,
but here's the catch--you guys go do the same thing later on this year when
you're out running!  I'd like to build a library of the tracks from our
street car speeds perspective.  Start sending me addresses, and you can send

	In Winston-Salem, North Carolina, we have been fortune enough for the 
last few winters to be required to purchase this "oxygenated fuel."  
Several of the larger population counties in the state, including mine, have 
been on the program for atleast 3 years.  I personally have been a 
regular customer of Gulf/BP which is required to participate in the 
program as are ALL stations in the county.  The pumps are indeed marked 
with an identification sticker.  However, because all county stations 
dispense the fuel, one would have to drive out of county, and in some 
instances through 2 or more counties, to obtain non-oxygenated fuel.  
Impracticable.  BP assures motorist no harm will occur.  So far they seem 
to be correct.  I have noticed no fluctuations in performance of my '87 
944, nor have I heard of anyone else having problems.  There have 
not been any recommendations from my mechanic concerning problems from 
the use of the fuel.

	Let's hope the good luck trend continues!

I think the key word here is TELEGRAPH. Meaning larger slip angles and

Not sure what unit you're referring too.  I believe that both the Haltech
and Horibia units are based on the same UEGO wide-range lambda sensor
manufactured by NGK.  The cost of the sender alone is well in excess of
$200.

The UEGO sender is pretty interesting, and was described by NGK engineers
in an SAE article a few years ago.  It senses oxygen in a lean exhaust,
and carbon monoxide in a rich exhaust.  The oxygen sensor used in cars
today is basically an on/off switch.  The UEGO is calibrated to produce
a signal saying how much oxygen or CO is present, that is, a real lambda
value.

The sender is quite expensive today.  I read recently that Toyota, which
has been interested in lean-burn for some time, will be producing and
selling a lean-burn car soon.  Hopefully in incorporates such a sender,
and the volume production will bring the UEGO price down.

I think some Formula 1 teams are using UEGO senders.

I can't help you with the clutch noise, but my 914 also had a similar problem
with failure to start.  In fact, it got so bad, that if the ambient temp
rose above 95F degrees, the car would stall.  Not much fun when trying to 
drive home in those hot Atlanta afternoons!

Solution:  Get a GOOD racing coil.  Seems that the coil would overheat and
open up.  I tried the regular Bosch coils, but two of them displayed the
same symptoms.  Once I got the racing coil, the problem went away.

Nick,

    This is a common problem with the pre-1975 914, which I'm going to 
    assume you have.  The fuel pump is located directly above the right-
    side heat exchanger control box.  This control box (or valve) directs 
    the hot air from the outlet of the heat exchanger either through the 
    ducts enclosed in the longitudinals (for heat) or directly to the 
    atmosphere.  Unfortunately, in the latter case, the expelled hot air
    does a great job of heating up the fuel pump.  This heat, in combination
    with the fuel pump _drawing_ the fuel through eight feet of fuel lines
    rather than _pumping_ it, causes vapor lock.  That's why the car starts
    fine when it cools down.

    There are two common solutions: 1) Add some type of heat deflector
    below the fuel pump, or 2) relocate the fuel pump to the front of
    the car underneath the fuel tank.  The second solution entails quite
    a bit of work, but is the more effective of the two.  Also, should
    you decide to relocate the fuel pump, you should replace the aging
    fuel lines in the tunnel.  These lines are steel tips going through
    the front of the tunnel that are press-fit into plastic tubes which
    run through the tunnel.  After relocating the pump, the fuel pressure
    in these lines is going to increase, and the plastic may rupture.
    I replaced my plastic lines with anodized aluminum which cost about
    $25 for a 25' roll.

    Good luck, and let me know how things go!

Subject: honeymoon and factory tour


	Hi everyone,

	Lisa and I just got back from our honymoon in Europe (family, 
Olympics, and Porsche factory tour!)  I wanted to thank the different
people who provided information about how to get on the tour and all.
I really recommend it to anyone who happens to be near Stuttgard.

	As many people have described the Porsche museaum (sp?) is fairly
small.  Unfortunately (or fortunately) they had changed the display from
the 30 Year of the 911 display. One side of the museam had a 
representative sample of some of the 356s (beautiful cars.)  The other
wall was the impressive one, though.  They had both the Quaker State
Indy car and the F1 car the Prost won in out on display!!!  There
were also a number of 956s.  I never realized how big the 956s are in
comparisio to the F1 and IndyCars.  Wow!!

	The actual tour of the factory was really cool.  We got to
see them actually assembling the rear subframe and boxer engines in the
993 and then mate the entire assembly into the car!!!  Other parts of
the tour included the engine assembly and dyno testing facilities, etc.
It was truly amazing how they put these cars together and the
care they use in assembling them!!

	The only downside was that I was pretty deathly ill, so I didn't
enjoy/notice as much as I probably could have ;-(.

	In any case I am looking forward to getting back to work on
my 914s!!

 	One other interesting side note:  the Germans ignore speed
limits even more then we do here.  Once we were doing 150 km/hr in
a 130 km/hr zone and she almost didn't get out of the way of a
928S4 doing 220 km/hr +.  There is truly an amazing closure rate
at those speeds!!  We managed the 600 km drive to Stuttgard in just
a little over 4 1/2 hours to!!  Driving there is certainly lots of
fun even though it requires LOTS more attention.

	Alex

(note: 100Km/hr is 62.5 mph)

    If the SOBs in your area are prone to this kind of infantile crap,
try to find spaces on the end of a row with extra room on one side.
At work, we have some "filler" space at the end of the row, since the
parking spaces are diagonal and the parking lot isn't.  Soren likes to
park in the parking space next to this filler.  He can park about 1/4
of a space out of his space, and nobody gets pissed.  YMMV.

    Check the owner's manual.  If it says straight dino juice is
OK, then the Pennzoil is OK.  Remember, in '78, they didn't have
much synthetic for street use, your engine was designed with dino
oil in mind!
    My personal feeling is that oil changes at 3K mi are mostly to
get the dirt and crud out of your engine.  As long as the oil is
a reasonable quality, you shouldn't be seeing much breakdown/etc.
in that short an interval.
    All the mechanics I've been to with my 914s have use Castrol
GTX 20W50.  When I do the oil myself, I usually use Pennzoil 30W.
I'm still not convinced that the multi-grade oils are the best
idea for an engine designed back in '69 or '70.

Subject: Re:  914 hot start problem

Item Subject: 914 starting problem
I have a 1970 914 that also experienced similar symptoms on no starting.  The
solution (in my case) was to install a "hard start" relay.  Now the ignition
switch is supplying low current to a relay on the starter, rather than having
all of the battery current run all the way to the ignition switch then back
to the starter.

I guess what happens is, that the resistance in the circuit can increase
enough when it gets hot that not enough current can get to the starter to do
anything.

I've also heard that a missing or loose transmission ground strap can cause
hot start issues.

On your clutch (?) issue, I had the clutch cable tube (it runs through the
firewall) break loose from the firewall.  This created lotsa slack in the
clutch cable which gave me a floppy pedal, no clutch.  Maybe yours has moved?
or nearly broke loose?


Hope this is helpful..

    Actually, MTBE is chemist-ese for "Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether."
It's not an alchohol, it's something else.  It is also *much* better
for your car than alchohol.  It does not have the propensity for 
eating some rubbers and plastics that alchohol does, and it won't
suck in the water the way that alcohol does.
    Of the two types of alcohol used, Ethanol is supposed to be the
less harmful.  (i.e., Methanol is worse.)

Not exactly.  The federal law doesn't require display of the amount,
just the fact that oxy-fuels are used.  But all *states*, except MN,
require oil companies to label pumps to show how much oxy-fuel is
in the gas.  However, the information is supposedly incorrect a lot.

I have had success with that as well...assuming the parking lot is big enough. 
Unless of course one is a victim of sheer perversity.  I parked my pcar in a
large grocery story lot one time, way out in the boonies, hundreds of feet from

just next to it but wihin inches of it.  There were about 3 inches between my

coincidence.  I was not pleased.  I managed to drive away unscathed, but not
without turning the air around me blue in the process.  I have known people who
have had cars keyed while parked out in the outskirts of a parking lot. I had
the sideview mirror unscrewed off the driver's side of my 914 once while it was
parked in the lot of the building where I work.  Now, if I drive my pcar to
work and have to leave it in the lot for the better part of a day, I'll put a
cover on it.  Then if someone wants to vandalize it, they may think twice.
Things like that really make you wonder about people, don't they?

I had a similar problem in my 71 911, and it turned out to be the 
starter. As the temperature goes up, electrical resistance goes up also. 
If you have a weak starter, heat may be the straw that breaks the camel's 
back. Also, check to see that you electrical connections are clean. My 
suggestion:

Try starting the hot car like this, put key to run position, listen for fuel
pump (sounds normal?), then try turning it over. Does everything slow down, 
dim, and not turn over? If it does, then it's probably your starter. You 
might be able to jump it if your battery is a little low. Luckily, 
starters are one of those inexpensive Porsche parts.

Sounds like your need to either get one of those relay kits that attaches to

Several years ago I had the same problem, buy a new starter fixed it.

Thanks to those who responded to my oil question!!!!!!!

I got about as many recommendations as there are types of oil.
But at least my main concern was put to rest, that was switching

Also to correct myself on MTBE, when I was at the pump this weekend
I noticed that it is 15% not 8% as I said earlier. That is interesting
considering what Bill Sulouff reported as to the effects of 10%-15%
mixtures.

Subject: 944 Motor Mounts...

Dear P C Schlesselmann,

With respect to your search for motor mounts for the 944/951:

It is general wisdom that 944s should upgrade to the 951 mounts.
Additionally, there is a heat shield for the right side mount which I believe
was introduced in '87. I notice you have an '86. This heat shield apparently
solves the problem of exhaust heat cooking the fluid filled mount on the
right side.

My impression is that the fluid filled mounts are really necessary for a
street car at least unless you want high levels of vibration and possibly a
nasty resonance with the body/chassis.

Hope this helps. (BTW, my '87 951's mounts are 45,000 miles old and still
fine).

This is a resubmission of an idea I posted earlier.

I, too, have had some large vehicle 'door dent' the driver's door on my
little orange monster. This brought tears to my eyes and sent my mind hell-
bent on a way to keep this from happening again.

The solution was a form of door guard, similar to those 'pillows' seen (after-
ward) on some infomertial. The cost is nil-

Get a piece of rope - preferably 3/4"-two to four ply, 10' long. Twist until
doubled. Hang a piece of stiff, insulated wire from the door handle and another
from the mirror until door dent height. Attach rope to wire making sure that
the rope extends past the rear of the door into the rear quarter panel. This
may look tacky, but keeps those blue hairs from swinging their big american-car
doors open into your little investment. I actually had one of these devices 
stolen! I hope they're getting good use out of it.

Good Driving!

Subject: 2.7 liter overheating/oil cooler

   Feel free to yell at me to go dig in the archives ...

   I have a 1974 2.7L 911 - for the past 4 years, I've been wrestling with
temperature problems.  It has just the engine mounted oil cooler, and I think
that I'm only going to get past this problem by adding a trombone cooler (at
least).  The wife is reluctant to "approve" $800 for the Turbo-trol kit
(advertised in Pano).  (Hell - we've spent more than that on the problem
already, but she's getting disappointed in the lack of results).

   I'll toss in a little history of my problem below - maybe I've overlooked
something, and net wisdom will safe me !

   If that doesn't work, what might I consider in adding a oil cooler ?
What pieces make up a kit, and what can I find used ?  Dare I hit the
junk yards for any of it ?

   Someone told me that the Turbo-trol kit was a fairly easy DIY - can it be
just as easy if I "assemble" my own pieces ?  My mechanical competance is only
fair - I did successfully upgrade my timing chain tensioners and adjust the
valves solo, but had great advice in advance and loans of tools and manuals.

   And what is the conventional wisdom about 2.7's and external coolers ?
The engine was designed to run OK without them, right ?  Is it just age that
changes things enough to cross the threshold ?

\chuck benz
benz@school.enet.dec.com

- ------  Some history of the problem - optional reading...

   I think that I recall a fairly hot day soon after I bought the car when
I ran down I-95 and observed that the temp "behaved well" - it was 5.5 years
ago, and I don't remember anything more specific.

   I first noticed the problem after my blower motor was disconnected (the
blower bracket bolt was stripped, and the mechanic who repaired it also 
removed the lamp cord that had been used to wire the blower - a previous 
owner wasn't too smart about wiring).  The mechanic claimed that the blower 
couldn't be related to the engine temp when I stopped back later to whine.

So far, the steps taken and observations include:
    - tightening the fan belt (basic, 1st step) - not the prob.
    - oil changes - temp improves, but not drastically, and not for long.
    - clean the oil cooler (on engine) - helps, but not for long.
    - remove alternator and clean engine, passage to cooler 
	(2 cans brake cleaner and putty knife) - helped some, not enough.
    - rewire blower - not significant
    - replace thermostat, clean oil cooler from above - helped, not for long.

The chain tensioner update was done in the middle of the above, so the problem
didn't stem from a mistake in that procedure.  I did replace the blower to
heat exchanger hoses at that time.  And the temp sender/gauge check out OK.

		  THE TEN BEST TOOLS OF ALL TIME
		  By J. William Lam, Stockton, CA

   There are only ten things in this world you need to fix any car, any
   place, any time.

   Forget the Snap-On Tools truck; it's never there when you need it.
   Besides, there are only ten things in this world you need to fix any
   car, any place, any time.

   1.  Duct Tape: Not just a tool, a veritable Swiss Army knife in stickum
   and plastic.  It's safety wire, body material, radiator hose,
   upholstery, insulation, tow rope, and more in one easy-to-carry
   package. Sure, there's a prejudice  surrounding  duct  tape  in
   concourse competitions, but in the real world everything from Le Mans -
   winning Porsches to Atlas rockets uses it by the yard.  The only thing
   that can get you out of more scrapes is a quarter and a phone booth.

   2.  Vice-Grips:  Equally adept as a wrench, hammer, pliers, baling wire
   twister, breaker-off of frozen bolts, and wiggle-it-till-it-falls off
   tool. The heavy artillery of your toolbox, Vice Grips are the only tool
   designed expressly to fix things screwed up beyond repair.

   3. Spray Lubricants: A considerably cheaper alternative to new doors,
   alternators, and other squeaky items.  Slicker than pig phlegm.
   Repeated soakings of WD-40 will allow the main hull bolts of the Andrea
   Dora to be removed by hand. Strangely enough, an integral part of these
   sprays is the infamous little red tube that flies out of the nozzle if
   you look at it cross-eyed, one of the ten worst tools of all time.

   4. Margarine Tubs With Clear Lids: If you spend all your time under
   the hood looking for a frendle pin that caromed off the peedle valve
   when you knocked both off the air cleaner, it's because you eat
   butter.  Real mechanics consume pounds of tasteless vegetable oil
   replicas, just so they can use the empty tubs for parts containers
   afterward.  (Some, of course, chuck the butter-colored goo altogether
   or use it to repack wheel bearings.) Unlike air cleaners and radiator
   lips, margarine tubs aren't connected by a time/space wormhole to the
   Parallel Universe of Lost Frendle Pins.

   5. Big Rock At The Side Of The Road: Block up a tire.  Smack corroded
   battery terminals.  Pound out a dent.  Bop nosy know-it-all types on
   the noodle.  Scientists have yet to develop a hammer that packs the raw
   banging power of granite or limestone. This is the only tool with which
   a "made in India" emblem is not synonymous with the user's maiming.

   6., Plastic Zip Ties: After twenty years of lashing down stray hoses
   and wired with old bread ties, some genius brought a slightly
   slicked up version to the auto parts market. Fifteen zip ties can
   transform a hulking mass of amateur-quality rewiring from a working
   model of the Brazilian rain forest into something remotely resembling a
   wiring harness.  Of course, it works both ways. When buying used cars,
   subtract $ 100.00 for each zip tie under the hood.

   7. Ridiculously Large Standard Screwdriver With Lifetime Guarantee:
   Let's admit it. There's nothing better for prying, chiseling, lifting,
   breaking, splitting, or mutilating than a huge flat-bladed screwdriver,
   particularly when wielded with gusto and a big hammer. This is also the
   tool of choice for oil filters so insanely located they can only be
   removed by driving a stake in one side and out the other. If you break
   the screwdriver - and you will, just like Dad or your shop teacher said
   - who cares? It's guaranteed.

   8.  Bailing Wire:  Commonly known as MG muffler brackets, bailing wire
   holds anything that's too hot for tape or ties. Like duct tape, it's
   not recommended for concourse contenders since it works so well you'll
   never replace it with the right thing again.  Bailing wire is a
   sentimental favorite in some circles, particularly with MG, Triumph,
   and flathead Ford set.

   9.  Bonking Stick: - This monstrous tuning fork with devilishly pointy
   ends is technically known as a tie-rod- end separator, but how often do
   you separate tie-ends?  Once every decade, if you're lucky. Other than
   medieval combat, its real use is the all purpose application of undue
   force, not unlike that of the huge flat-bladed screwdriver. Nature
   doesn't know the bent metal panel or frozen exhaust pipe that can stand
   up to a good bonking stick. (Can also be used to separate tie-rod ends
   in a pinch, of course, but does a lousy job of it).

   10. A Quarter and a Phone Booth:
