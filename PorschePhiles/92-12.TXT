I thought that the change was away from the superheterodyning design which
all detectors use(d).  At least this was what Valentine suggested at a
conference he spoke at a couple of years ago.  (This was at a time when the
VG-2 was being used in Canada, but before he had announced his own radar
detector product.)

If it's simply a matter of better shielding, is it possible or practical to
upgrade the shielding on existing units, like a Passport?

Brake Pad Wear

Getting your car's brake pads to wear evenly is worthwhile.  It both 
increases the longevity of the pad, and improves the "pedal feel:" the 
sense of firmness and response you get when you use your brakes.


Why pads wear unevenly

Disc brake systems operate by turning the kinetic energy of a car in 
motion into heat.  Brake pads are pressed against steel rotors attached 
to the car's wheels.  There is friction between the pads and the rotors, 
and this friction causes the car to slow as its momentum is dissipated 
as heat in the pads and rotors.  Over time, this friction causes brake 
pads to wear.  When enough of them has worn away, they need to be 
replaced.

Why would pads wear unevenly? The areas of a brake pad called upon to do 
more work, or which run hotter, will wear away faster.  Although 
pressing a pad against a rotor may seem to distribute the load fairly 
evenly, it does not.

Uneven wear occurs in roughly three different forms:

 * longitudinal taper,
 * radial taper, and
 * inner vs. outer pad depth.

The leading edge of a brake pad is the one that may be thought of as 
first touching the rotor as it turns.  If your calipers are mounted 
behind the wheel axis, the bottom pad edges will lead.  The friction of 
the pad against the turning rotor causes the pad itself to try to rotate 
about an imaginary axis behind it, with the effect that the leading edge 
of the pad presses harder against the rotor, doing more work and getting 
hotter.  This uneven heating leads to longitudinal wear: uneven pad 
depth from leading to trailing edges.

Radial taper wear can be seen as a difference in pad depth along the 
radius of the rotor.  A brake caliper is mounted to its strut on one 
edge.  The forces created by applying the brake pedal cause yet another 
twisting moment, this time of the caliper assembly around an axis 
through its mounting points.  There are other factors as well: a square-
ish pad against a round rotor means that the radially inner part of the 
rotor will spend proportionally more time under the pad, and less in 
cooling air.  Heat differences also exist because the inner edge of the 
rotor interfaces with the hub rather than air, limiting conduction.

Differences in wear between the inner and outer pads arise for two 
different reasons.  The first is a car's tendency to "toe out" under 
breaking, that is, for the front half of a tire to move outward, the 
rear half inward.  Because of this tendency, we compensate by giving 
cars a little toe-in in their alignment.  This toeing places a little 
more load on the inner pad in a caliper mounted behind the axle.

The second reason for inner/outer wear differences has to do with 
floating caliper designs, such as used in the 944 and 944S.  If the 
floating half of the caliper does not move absolutely freely, the fixed 
half's pad does a little more work.  By the way, this is the reason 
944's with a single pad wear sensor use it in the inside pad.


What happens when they do

Uneven wear from inner to outer pad will not itself have any effect on 
braking performance on the street -- unless you run out of inner pad 
altogether!  Tapered wear, the other two kinds, will make it necessary 
for the pads to move greater distances when the brakes are used, meaning 
more brake fluid transfer, meaning longer pedal travel.  This pedal 
travel by itself degrades the "feel" of the brakes, and adds to the time 
it takes to make them effective.  When combined with other sources of 
pedal fade, such as boiled fluid or glazed pads, you can find yourself 
running out of brakes.

Tapered pads increase pedal travel for two reasons.  Pushing a 
longitudinally or radially tapered brake pad against its rotor, a brake 
piston will "cock," that is, move off-centre in its bore in the caliper.  
Cocking creates a greater volume for fluid in the caliper, which causes 
a spongy pedal.

The other source is "knock off."  When the driver releases the brake 
pedal, the radial and longitudinal twisting moments disappear and the 
caliper falls back into nominal alignment.  However, because the pad is 
worn at an angle, the rotor will push the pad and so its piston back 
farther into the caliper.  Because of this, the pad will have to travel 
more to get to the rotor next time the brakes are used, meaning more 
fluid transfer, meaning more pedal travel.  In fact, knock off can be a 
problem even with flat pads because of all the knocking about the 
unsprung parts of the suspension take on imperfect road surfaces.  It is 
exacerbated by tapered pads.


How to correct for uneven wear

Uneven pad wear was taken into consideration by the original design of 
your car, and it should also be addressed in your maintenance.  Looking 
first at the car's design, there is the need to apply slightly different  
pressure to the brake pads longitudinally and radially.  The possible 
solutions depend on whether the car employs a fixed caliper with 
multiple pistons on each side (e.g., 944 Turbo, 944S2), a fixed caliper 
with a single piston on either side (914/4), or, in the case of a 
floating caliper design, a single piston (944, 944S).

With multiple pistons, wear can be tuned by staggering their bores' 
location in the caliper.  It can also be tuned by using slightly 
differently sized pistons.  For example, the 944 Turbo and the 944S2 use 
fixed caliper, four-piston brakes on all four corners.  The '85 944 
Turbo front caliper holds a 36 mm piston on its leading end, and a 
larger 38 mm piston on the trailing end.  The rears use 28 and 30 mm 
pistons.  This idea is incorporated into the AP six-piston caliper used 
by this year's Formula 1 cars.

On the other hand, the 944 and 944S use a floating caliper with a single 
piston.  Differential pad pressure is created by removing some of the 
lip of the piston, so that not all the piston's circumference presses 
against the pad.  The trailing-edge brake pistons in the '85 944 Turbo 
also share this "piston offset" feature.

Now let's look at what needs to be taken care of as maintenance.  
Foremost is basic mechanical soundness of your car.  Make sure your 
alignment is right, and repair or replace any loose or worn ball joints, 
tie rods, bushings, and other suspension hardware.  Your brake fluid 
should be fresh and bled free of air.

If you have brake pistons with the offset design, you need to make sure 
that each piston is correctly aligned in its bore.  Because of 
manufacturing tolerances and seal wear, pistons can tend to slowly turn 
over time.  I recommend checking them every time you replace your pads.  
The correct position for the missing lip varies across models, and even 
from front to rear.  For example, in the 930/911 Turbo, the four-piston 
offsets should point away from one another on one axle, and towards one 
another on the other axle.

The accompanying figure shows a simple tool you can make to check the 
alignment of the piston in a 914/4, 944, or 944S caliper.  Trace it onto 
thin cardboard and cut it out.  There should be a twenty degree angle 
between the caliper edge along which the top (914/4) or bottom (944, 
944S) of the brake pad slides, and a line joining end-points of the 
missing part of the piston lip.  With the pad out, you can slide the 
cardboard template into the caliper and against the piston to check it.

If you find that a piston has turned, you can carefully rotate it back 
into position.  The steps are as follows:

 1. Thoroughly clean the caliper area so that you can see what you're 
doing.  This should be normal practice when replacing pads.  Using 
a towel moistened with rubbing alcohol, clean the piston lip and 
the rubber boot or seal between the piston and caliper.

 2. You can use a pair of slip joint (aka channel lock) pliers to turn 
the piston.  Extend the piston enough that you can get a grip on 
it, by depressing the brake pedal.  Be very careful not to 
overextend the piston, i.e., any more than it would be with minimal 
pad depth.  A small block of wood of the right depth, inserted 
temporarily in place of the pad, is a good idea.

 3. Put a strip of duct tape on each jaw of your slip joint pliers.  
You want to avoid scoring or bending the brake piston or damaging 
its boot.

 4. Gripping the end of the piston, use the pliers to gently turn it 
into alignment.

When servicing floating caliper brakes, you should clean the caliper 
pair's sliding surfaces and lubricate them with a heavy grease or anti-
seize.  This reduces work differences from side-to-side and so inner vs. 
outer wear differences.

I'll conclude by saying that taper wear has made a difference to me.  At 
my last track event this season I had more pedal travel than I was used 
to.  I thoroughly bled all my brakes, but that didn't solve the problem.  
When I got home and replaced the pads, I found the fronts were tapered 
and two pistons had turned.  With re-aligned pistons and fresh pads, my 
pedal feel returned to normal.

Subject: Air Filter and washer hoses

1 DEC

I've sent this out 2 times in the last few days, but have never seen it
reflected, so I don't know what's going on ...  It never bounced back to me
...  (OOPs. I sent it to the 'request' id. Sorry, Stan.)

HI. Happy Turkey to everyone. I have some problems and maybe
people can help ....

1)	I thought it would be a good idea to replace the air filter on my
	944S2, so I bought a new one from Imparts.  (When I had replaced the
	filter in my old '85 944 it was a simple operation.)  When the filter
	arrived I opened the hood, and *huh* the plastic airbox holding the
	filter -- at least the one I was expecting from my 944 experience --
	wasn't there!

	The owner's manual had an explanation and photo for the 944, and an
	explanation and photo for the 944 Turbo.  Regarding the 944S2 there
	was only an ominous announcement that the filter should be replaced by
	an authorized Porsche mechanic.

	The Haynes book is no use at all.  It only has the info on the vanilla
	944.

	Does anyone have any ideas??  The hose into the intake manifold goes
	forward towards the radiator and then disappears under the metal
	nosepiece.  There is no box which might contain a filter anywhere in
	sight.

2)	My windshield washers only emit a very few drops.  The pump motor
	makes lots of noise, so I assume that the hoses are clogged, rather
	than the pump being broken.  What do I do?  The hoses are fastened
	with what seems to be a '1-use' clamp.  You can't open it, I think.
	Both sides are equally feeble, so I suspect the hose being clogged
	rather than one or the other of the nozzles.

Much obliged for any help. I really don't want to waste the $$ on
something that I should be able to do myself.

Subject: additives

Slick-50

I have put Slick-50 in at least 7 vehicles in the last two years 
(including a V8 inboard ski boat and a motorhome) and have not seen
any changes in fuel economy or performance.  The exception *might*
be the boat, which does seem to rev higher than it used to, but
I haven't ruled out a goofy tach.  At $20 a qt I figured that if
it does reduce wear, if only during start-up, that it might be
worth it.  All the discussion of causing engine damage leaves me a
little concerned and cautious about adding it to other engines.

Anyone have any real Slick-50 experience?  None of the engines I
have that are running Slick-50 have "planned" rebuilds upcoming,
but if one does get torn down, I'll be sure and look for benefits
or damage that Slick-50 may have contributed to.

Mobil 1

Kind of a side, MasterCraft Boats has teamed up with Mobil 1 and offer
a lifetime gaurantee on new boat motors maintained as per contract against
mechanical failure (not sure on exact specifics).  

Lead Additives

I have a Corvair that just doesn't seem to like the fuels available today.
Normal driving isn't too bad, but I get low end pinging and terrible
pinging pulling a long grade on a hot/warm day.  Octane boost and flooring
it up hills (it has a 4-carb motor) help some.  On impulse I added some
lead additive the other day and felt a noticable improvement in performance.
As a test, I purposly lugged the car in 3rd gear and stepped on it
simulating a condition that normaly results in detonation.  It pinged a
little but immediately quit and pulled smoothly.

Am I imaging things, or is this a benefit of the lead additives?  I was
really just tossing it in the tank to possibly aid in lubrication of
the valve train, but at Auto Club the stuff is cheap enough to add
regularly.

Well, it's not a Porsche, but "air cooled boxer six" is close enough...

That certainly sounds like octane-related detonation.

How much of which kind of lead additive did you add to what grade of gas?
I have used some of the "RealLead" additive in my air-coled flat-four,
with good results. I added it to 94 octane Sonoco, at about the recommended
mix, and got a noticeable improvement in low-rev on-throttle performance.

> Am I imaging things, or is this a benefit of the lead additives?  

If you have a high-compression (and maybe high-temperature) engine, this
is precisely the kind of effect that the high-octane leaded gas was supposed
to have.

Subject: RE: Radar detector research - Help!

I'd second what others have said; the Valentine seems to be the current 
best, if not the prettiest!

I spoke at length with Mike Valentine at CVR's Tech Tactics about 2 
years ago.  He is one of the founders of Cincinnati Microwave, and 
lives in/near Cincinnati.  He sold out to a partner (and became a 
millionaire, thanks to the police!), and built the g-Analyst.  He's not 
going to improve the g-Analyst, he says, because there's so little 
market that it's not worth it to him.  His new radar detector, which 
non-competition clauses prevented him from mentioning or acknowledging 
two years ago, is quite state-of-the-art.  It's a bit clunky and you 
have to look at it to get maximum benefit, unlike simpler units where 
the beep's tone and duration tell all.

On the subject of detector detectors: they work just like regular radio 
receivers.  They're tuned to the local oscillator frequency of a 
typical X/K superhet detector.  Shielding a detector may help, but some 
radiation has to get out via the antenna anyway.  The Valentine 1 uses 
new, uncommon internal frequencies so current detector detectors won't 
pick it up.  However, once the VG-2 manufacturers notice this fact, 
they'll simply alter their hardware and begin selling a VG-3.

i have a non-porsche query i'd like to get some opinions on.

i've been thinking of taking "oregon track car" off my 951S'
job description and have been wondering what other steed might
be suitable for the occasional outing at pir.

the local porsche club doesn't care what you run, and in fact
only gets two or three track *days* per year at pir (ironically,
the only munincipal road racing circuit in the country!) so
i don't feel constrained by marque.

i have wanted a mid-engined car forever, and have pretty much
given up hope that porsche will produce another one (the 914
never came in my size), so i've been thinking maybe an MR2
might be an interesting track car.

unfortunately, it looks like i don't fit in the turbo (they
all have t-tops) and i worry about how the non-turbo brakes
would hold up on the track.  not to mention how the car in
general would fare.

does anyone have experience with MR2's, particularly the '93
model?  please spare me what i've already read what's in the
car mags about the change in suspension.

Fred -

OK, Fred, everyone is now laughing at you behind your virtual back!  The
944S2 is distinguished by, among other things, the fact that you have to
remove a body panel to replace the air filter.

Yes, the filter box is under the header panel.  I've never removed one
myself, but the instructions are on page 50-5 of the workshop manual
(photocopy/fax available upon request).  Steps are:

 1. Raise engine hood and run out [raise] concealed headlamps.

 2. Cover bumpers and remove cover strips [apparently the rubber flashing
    visible when you raise the headlamp] to avoid damaging the paint
    finish.  [Photo shows cardboard or cloth across the bumper, tucked in
    under the header panel.]

 3. Unscrew mounting nuts and remove bolts.  [Photos shows four fasteners
    accessible from within space revealed by raised headlamp.  First photo
    shows two nuts under rubber flashing, fastening header panel to bumper.
    Second photo shows hex head bolt fastening farthest extent of header
    panel to front fender.  Third photo shows philips head screw basically
    opposite last: on inboard side of the headlamp well.

    Next photo shows four screws fastening top lip of header panel.]

 4. Take panel off of car forward.  [Ie, pull it towards you.  This is where
    covering the bumper is important, it would seem.]

Filter box now exposed - you figure out the rest.  Installation is obvious. 
You apparently have to fiddle to get the panel aligned properly.

No particular idea.  The hoses appear to be unclamped at the nozzles
themselves.  So I would start by breaking them free of the nozzles to
make sure the latter are not clogged.  If this isn't the case, go out
and buy a bunch of baby zebra hose clamps.  Then starting at the fluid pump,
cut out the old clamps and trace the blockage, replacing with the zebras.

(Trick to breaking a rubber/plastic hose free is first to grab it over the

turning rather than pulling.  Then pull it off the nipple by hand, or push
it off carefully with a flat bladed screwdriver.)

Of course, you can buy the proper hose clamps from Porsche or Wurth.  I
think they have their size stamped on them; the one I justed peaked at
said "10.5" meaning 10.5 mm.  Wurth makes them from 9 to 17.5 mm.  The
workshop manual pictures the proper tool for these babies, which both
removes them and crimps new ones (pp 92-2 - 92-3).  It does not call out a
Porsche tool number for them (!), but I bet you can get a pair from Wurth or
from Snap-On.

Subject: Re: RSR frt and rear

Did you get my reply to this yesterday? We're running two cars with RSR rear
setup, minus the Heim joint. One of those has RSR front struts as well.

The front-and-back coil over car is running 1200 lb springs in the rear and
800 lb springs in the front. No torsion bars, just coils. Mind you, this is
*NOT* a street car, but an IMSA GTU car that finished 5th in class at 
the 12 hours of Sebring and 7th in class at the 24 hours of Daytona. As to
sources, Eibach and Rockwell seem to be pretty much it.

The other car is a '70 911T that got a 3.2 Carrera engine and G50 trans-
axle transplated into it. To make it work, the torsion housing had to be
cut. Hence the rear coil-overs. No torsion bars there either. I think
it's running on 300 lb springs.

Looking at converting to coil over on one of the 914s as well. I have no
idea what front spring rate will be needed, but I'd guess about 300 to match
the  320s being run in the rear.

Sigh... Back in town, back on top of things (I hope)

1) the sealer you want is Wurth Rust Guard. The part number for one 
   quart can of black is 89091903. You can get it in red and clear
   as well, changing the last digit to 4 or 5 respectively. It's on
   special this month, so is even cheaper than usual. I forget the
   sale price, but think it's like $16/quart or so.

2) front pan clip. Still haven't found one. Thought we had one, but
   it was from a car with A/C and as a result, was a big tin patch
   already. Bleah. I still have your money order, and will return it
   to you if you wish. Still looking for the clip, though. It's just
   that all the 914s hulks I've seen are either rusted out, have had
   A/C, or have already been sectioned. And we're not about to carve
   up one of the cars we're using for something... 8{)

Subject: Front suspension noise?


I made myself available to post Porsche queries to other Porsche Club members
without internet access, and I have finally been taken up on the offer.....

A local Porsche-cluber has a problem with his 79 924.  Turning around left hand
corners he hears a hollow sound from the LH front wheel.  Sounds to me like a
wheel bearing, he said he has about 1/4 inch movement when moving the top and
bottom of the wheel.  Other possibility is a suspension bush.

I told him to try and tighten the bearing nut on the end of the spline to see
if there is any change.  He would appreciate any other opinions if you guys have
other solutions.

With 1/4" of play, it should be reasonably easy to isolate the problem.
Have your friend move the wheel through the 1/4", and see if the strut
moves along with it. You can do this reasonably easily by feel if you
wrap your hand over the top of the tire and touch the strut while you
move the wheel through the range of play. You can isolate the cause
of movements much smaller than 1/4" in this way. If the wheel moves
relative to the strut, the problem is wheel bearings. Conceptually,
your proposal to tighten the nut is right. However, I would be concerned
that with 1/4" of play, there could be damage to the rollers or races,
and I would propose that he change them. This is a useful routine
maintenance job anyway, especially if they have not been changed before
on a 1979 car. 

If the wheel and strut seem to move together, then the problem is
the various bushings which position the strut relative to the car.
Have someone look under the car while the wheel is moved through its
play, and find the part which is moving relative to the chassis.
It could be ball joints, A-arm bushings or the strut bushing at the top.
However, 1/4" is so big that I suspect it has to be wheel bearings.

The Toyota MR2 Turbo USED to be available WITHOUT the T-tops.  Did this

'91 MR2 Turbo on several occasions.  It is a nice car.  For the money -
pretty awesome!  I haven't experienced any problems with the brakes and I
haven't heard of any complaints from other drivers.  The '93 should be
even better . . . BTW - just how tall are you?  I am 6'-3" and fit fairly
well.  The harness somewhat obstructs seat movement which makes it a bit
less comfortable - leg room wise - but head room is adequate.  Oh, I can
tell you that the MR2's ABS produces a noticeable/slightly annoying
pulsation in the pedal.  Much more pronounced than say the Vette or any
Porsche.  Don't know anything about non-turbo MR2s - go for the TURBO;  It
has much better power - the non-T is kinda slow.  In general, the MR2 is a
nice "race"-car.  Very well balanced, good power, good brakes, good
handling.  I say GO FOR IT!

Subject: K&N filter modification

I've been thinking about installing K&N watershield air filters on top of the
MFI stacks on my 73 911S and was wondering if anyone out there has either done
the same or seen it done.  I'm getting sick of having to mail order air
filters, as there seems to be zero support for foreign cars in this region of
North Carolina.

First of all, are the MFI stacks shorter than Webers so that you could get away
using full size watershield K&N filters with an AC condenser on the trunk lid
or are you stuck with the short ones?  Is it a big pain to get them to mount
properly (ie do they fit)?  How about securing them - from the pictures the
watershield filters appear to have two bolts situated between the cylinders. 
Could you simply thread two holes on the top of the stacks to take the bolts?

I saw an article in European Car many months ago that had a mongo-modified 911
that had done this modification, but no details were provided.

Thanks,

right, if you talk about a problem on the network, other cars around the
world will very soon have the exact same problem ;-) It is truly incredible.
This morning I had need of my trusty windshield washer. I pressed the lever
and waited.  Nothing appeared on the passenger's side. Three blue dribbles
oozed from the driver's side nozzle...  ANd then, *PooF*! Smoke rolls out from

Something went sadly awry with the power supply to my 931's w/w pump.
Found the cause of all the smoke.  Blocked fluid line. The culprits are
the little barrel shaped T fitting(s) going to the individual nozzles.
Apparently, they had some kind of one-way flow business inside them, but they
are currently a no-way flow device, either in or against the direction of the
arrow on the body. Since I'm not just around the corner from a dealer, there
must be a simple way to unclog them rather than throw them away? Any ideas?
Can't see inside to tell if they are more than just a weird T with a tiny
orifice going to one port or what...

Subject: 951 questions

Hi guys!

This is my first post here.  I recently bought an 86 951 and I am
having fun.  I just bought/installed the AutoThority stage 2 kit.
I like it! Does anyone have any bad things to say about this setup?

On to some other piddily questions...One of my rear speakers is dead.
I'm wondering about putting something back there other than a euro
4x6.  What have people been able to put back there?  I would love it
if some 6" round speakers would fit (since I already have them).
I should note that I would prefer not to mame the car.  I want to 
leave everything stock looking.  i.e. no 6x9s in the rear deck...

Is the clock supposed to be lit?  What is the source of the light?

About factory shop manuals... I checked at the local dealer about getting
a manual.  he seemd suprised and I don't trust what he was saying would 
be complete.  Something like 4 volumes total including the turbo
supplement. What are the correct volumes/part #s?

Final question: From reading the archives, it seems like 245/45x16s will
fit on my rears...   My 205s are shot, new 225s in the back and the prices
for 205s and 245s are the same at the moment (goodyears at the tire rack).
Is there any reason not to put the 245s on the rear?

Thanks!!!!!!

Subject: 2 subjects-  Oil and 912's

REGARDING                2 subjects:  Oil and 912's
    I have two separate questions for anyone/everyone.

1)  Many people recommend 20W50 oil for the air-cooled Porsches.  However, The
Book states that the 914 originally used straight 30-weight.  Why would I want
a thinner oil?  Especially since I have an old (120K) engine which presumably
does not have as tight tolerances as a new one.  Remember, this is a VW type 4,
so the oil gets changed every 2500 to 3000 miles, whether it gets dirty or not.

2)  What are the plusses and minuses of the 912?  Is it really a 911 with the
4-cyl engine (Type 1?) and a different transmission?  Is there anything to look
out for specifically?  Someone out here (Northern CA) is offering one that
_sounds_ like it's in good shape for $3500.  (Yeah, I know, what's wrong with
it?)  Is there a particular year to beware of, like the 2.7L 911's?

    Thanks in advance!

And if it isn't bad enough that my 924S has a leaky washer fluid reservior,
now once I fix it I'll have to fix the motor and hoses too! :-(

The solution (as in the case of engineering) is not to use the word pr**lem.
Simply call it a feature instead, and be greatful for it.

Actually my 931 had two features in this area.  The motor was corroded big
time, so that was replaced.  I never figured out the other feature, namely
that the washer streams were misaimed.  The outer stream on the driver's
side missed wide and high, and I think the others were almost as bad.  It's
not as though the nozzles were mounted cockeyed on the hood (they weren't
the round ones that can be adjusted), so I figured that the fluid pressure
was too high.  I had cleaned out the nozzle, there were no indications that
they were partially blocked.  Oh well, that's water under the bridge (or fluid
over the roof :-)

Ah, a question I can answer! The source of the light for the clock is an
obscure class M star in the galaxy we call the Milky Way.

Translation: You just bought a $40,000 (originally) car that has an
inexcusably bad clock. Not only is it not lit, but being an LCD that's
angled toward the middle or passenger side of the car, it's nearly 
impossible to read even when there is sunlight falling on it.

I see two alternatives:

1. Sell the car and get one with a readable clock.

2. Buy a Mickey Mouse watch, remove the wrist strap, and use two-sided
tape to attach the watch on the dashboard between the rear-window
defogger switch and the air recirculation switch.

Personally, I chose option 2. :-)  It's nice having a Disney store nearby...

Ken -

I'm just guessing here.  If your nozzles or fitting are clogged, then
how you clean them depends on what has clogged them.  If oil or sludge
of some sort from the reservoir is at fault, perhaps letting them sit
in mineral spirits or shooting them with carb cleaner would help.  If
they are clogged with minerals from water, perhaps soaking them in a
hot water/vinegar solution would do the trick.

Or you may price out the part and decide to just buy new ones.

Not sure what The Book is, but I would guess it was written some years
before multi-grade oils gained legitimacy.  Multi-grade mineral oils, like
20W50, have viscosity improvers which make the oil's viscosity change less
as its temperature does.  They are absolutely and inarguably the way to
go with your car.

I would not pick an oil grade based on an engine's age or on its consumption
rate.  I would pick the oil grade which kept the engine properly lubricated.
Oil is cheap, after all.

Ha!  Very good.  There is a third option of my own invention:

3. Be so stupid when ordering your car, that after selecting among all the
other available options with great finesse, you actually plump for the

When I had mine replaced, I noticed that the mounting panel is all set to
accept a 6" round instead of a 4x6.  The 4x6 template is, as I recall,
screwed into the 6" round template.  I think the only thing you have to
be aware of is any limit to the depth of the speaker.  I know this is
an issue at the front (Pyle Drivers fit), but don't know about the rear.

>Is the clock supposed to be lit?  What is the source of the light?

Yes, whenever the engine is running.  A bulb.  I think the best way to
get at it is by removing the glove box, which is not difficult.  Could be
mistaken...

There are now six volumes in the basic 944 set (I, IA, II, III, IV, V),
and one more for the 944 Turbo.  The latest supplement to the 944 set is
number 24, and the latest I have personally for the 944 Turbo is number
3.  (Anyone know of a later one for the Turbo?)  Any dealer can give you
the right part numbers.  They appear in the blue literature bulletins from
PCNA.  A dealer will also sell you a set with all the supplements gratis,
which is not always the case in the aftermarket since they carry older
stock at times.

245/45 x 16 tires will fit fine on 8J x 16 rims at the rear.  The only
reason not to use them is the decreased road holding wider tires suffer
in the wet and snow.  But for summer fun, they're great.

For street and race, I use straight 40W oil. For race, it's Valvoline Racing,
for street its (surprise) Valvoline Racing. Why? Well, we have this sponsorship
deal and... For the record, I also like Amsoil Racing 40W. And have used
Valvoline (regular) 50W in the summer on the street. The street engine is a 
150k tired decrepit 1.8L. The race engine is well, constantly kept fresh.

On both, oil changes every 3 months or 3000 miles. Using only German-made 
Mann oil filters for the street engine and Canton/MECCA canister filters for
all of the race engines. You just don't want that bypass coming on and not
filtering every last drop of oil in a zillion dollar race engine... 8{(
(I'm putting one on my 911 as an Xmas project, for just the same reason).

The 912 really is a 911 with a 4-cylinder engine. Not Type I, but 356. The
transmission may or may not be the same as the early 911. Some 912s have a
4-speed, some have 5-speed. The 5-speeds are all standard 901s. 

There are several things to beware of: (1) 356 engines run like Beetles and
cost like 935s. Crankshafts are nearly $1k. Heads are over $1k. You can't
hardly get good machine work done on them, as no one does much of it any
more. So you wind up having work done again and again (by different shops,
natch, as the first one screwed it so you don't want to give them a second 
shot). And if it doesn't need work now, it will sooner than you expected,
as 356s have *ONLY* bypass oil filters, which get up to 30% of the oil to
filter. Wow. Just the way *I'd* build an engine... And you can't add a full-
flow filter to it, as people routinely do Type Is, because of the way
the oil pump is machined into the case instead of being a seperate part.

Cost to rebuild a 356/912 engine is on the order of $5k if you don't have
to replace the crank. And the crank and rods are noted for breaking at 6000
or fewer hours of operation if driven in extreme circumstances or 
in mis-assembled engines or with infrequently changed oil.... It just get
grimmer as you go.

(2) the early 911 short wheelbase body has enormous potential for rust.
And fixing it can be expensive, particularly some of the front-end rust
that can involve structural pieces. And be really careful as many of the
early cars have evolved into Flinstone-mobiles (i.e. no floor).

Recommmendation: go forth and buy Brett Johnson's book "The Porsche 911 
and 912: A Restorer's Guide to Authenticity" for reference on where to look
for rust, etc. on the car. Go buy a copy of Harry Elfrink's book "The Porsche
Technical Manual" for reference on the 356 engine and its foilbles. 

[sidebar: I used to recommend Harry Pellow's materials. I have given mine all 
away after watching "The Maestro Tapes", wherein he does nearly everything 
wrong you can do wrong on a 356 rebuild. I had the (mis?)fortune of sitting 
through this with a fellow who was *factory trained* (back when 911s were just 
coming out) on 356, 911, 912, 914 and 914/6s. He nearly passed out a couple 
of times watching Harry. Sigh.]

Final recommendation: 912s are great cars. They handle better than early 911s,
they have the timeless appeal of the 356 engine and the 911 styling. A
great combination. I like them a lot. It's just easy to get burned buying 
one. But, for $3500, how bad can it be? I just bought a '68 912 for $2000
*just to get the engine and wheels*. I'm parting out the rest of the car.
If you get one that is usable for $3500, that's a deal...

[yes, if anyone wants parts, shoot me some mail...]

Yep, the clock should light when you insert the key and turn it at

Speakers are a MAJOR pain in the ### to put in the back.  The only way
to di it realy right is to remove the quarter window (Whioch is actulayy
pretty simple).

Another way to go, which I did, is to build a removable box for the back
to house 6x9" good speakers (polk's are beautiful) and possibly a
subwoofer.

If you're really  interested in this setup (which, incidentally,
conforms around the spare tire bump and only decreases hauling space
minimally) I can send yoiu plans, but you have to be pretty interested
'cause I would have to draw them up!

These is no better way to leave the car stock looking and get phenomenal
sound.

The weakness, actually, becomes the front speakers.  No 4x6 you put in
the door will gove proper imaging.   What is needed are some hi-mid-hi
speakers mounted in the top of the door or somewhere high.  I bit the
bullet and cut the door panels, but the result was very stock looking
(used polk mm1001 or some such)

There are also great places to hide amps (like on a drop in board in
wedge shape in front of the spare tire, and in the right rear storage,
the left reserved for a CD changer)

If you do it right the entire system is removable for track use in less
than 5 minutes.

Subject: Rear defroster resistance

Does anyone know what sort of resistance reading you should get across the
elements of a rear window defroster?  I'm getting around 10K ohms on mine which
seems rather high.  That would translate to about 0.015 watts...

I've gone through and checked everything I can on the window - cleaned the
ground straps, etc.  I'm becoming convinced that the traces have just
oxidized to nothing.  Does anyone have an early (pre 73) defroster window that
works?

Mine's kind of interesting as it is divided into 3 sections, with a 2-stage
pull switch on the dask.  The first setting appears to turn on the middle
section, and the 2nd setting turns on all 3.  This doesn't show up in the
Haynes electrical schematics until the 83 Carrera...

Maybe I should subscribe to the Italian driving credo: go faster than everyone
else and it won't matter what's behind you.  That way I wouldn't need to look
out the rear window...

Having bought ($2700) a running '66 912 this year,
I would *STRONGLY* recommend in addition you
find a early 911/912 owner to examine the car with you.  Or, someone with
experience in finding/fixing rust on these cars.  I found rust
in places even the books didnt mention!  If possible, get it up
in the air, and if you spent less than 30 minutes looking for rust,
you probably didnt look long enough!  I found a lot of rust while
removing the undercoating that wasnt immediately apparent unless
you "poke" the undercoating.  If its loose from the floor pan/area,
be suspicious.

One additional area to examine very closely is the metal surrounding
the trailing arms.  The replacement sheet metal is $250/side and
very difficult to replace.  Examine the area from the "wheel well" and
also from behind.

I like the 356 engine, it seems easier to work on than the 911, but
there are trade-offs.

Good Hunting!

I can't say from personal experience, but I've been told that the
rear quarter area (under the rear windows) is a very poor acoustical
space, and you're not going to get very good sound out of there. Also
heard it's a pain to access the area. 

Question for people with windshield antennas: Anybody able to get decent
radio reception? I put in a Denon 8770, but the radio is near-useless
but for the strongest of stations. Thinking about a real antenna but

Hey thanks for all the answers guys!

I guess that I'll try to fix the clock this afternoon.

As for the AutoThority kit, I like it.  There is a very noticeable 
increase in torque.  More boost will do this ya know.  The increase 
comes in a usable range.  The car comes alive at about 3200 and just
plain pulls harder than it used to.  The reliability question will
have to be answered as time goes by.

Thanks again!

Hi Brandon, I've got the Stage 2 Autothority kit, and I like it a lot.  
I don't have anything bad to say about it, except that you should limit 
your boost to 1.8 peak / 1.7 steady on the track, or you'll be buying 
head gaskets.  For street use it doesn't matter since you can't 
(?shouldn't) be on full boost for very long...

I didn't use their orifice in the control line; instead, I installed a 
small inline valve, so I can vary my boost up/down.  It takes 2 seconds 
under the hood to adjust it.

I think the clock lamp question has been answered already.  The rear 
speakers are a little difficult to get at, compared to the fronts.  
Others have already addressed that one too, so I won't add to the 
network traffic except to say it's not a one-hour job.  Maybe a one-day job?

Yes, 225/245 tires fit perfectly.  I had a slight problem with the 
front fender lip clearance, but the tires quickly asserted themselves 
and the problem self-solved.  The 951, especially a chipped one, 
*needs* 245's in the back.  But if you plan on driving in the winter, 
you might want to go down to 225 or 205, as Kevin Gross suggested 
(higher unit area loading - better in the snow / rain).

not quite...  a 912 is a 911 with a 356SC motor and the *same* tranny as
in a 911.

one thing to look out for - specific to the 912 - is a tired engine.  some

engine is strong and tight (or that you can afford to make it so).

} 		-- Jay
Alpine CD changer (5952 I think) and 7920 (I think) head unit.

It's a non-powered model, so I had amps stuffed in the area between the
spare and the spare tire hole and in the right storage compartment.

I had room for 3 amps (1 85x2, 1 50x2, 1 25x2) an active crossover.  All
was completely hidden and dropped in w/o modifications, including the
CD changer, which as mounted on a board which was wedged into place with
an interlocking chock.

Sounds pretty complicated, but the beauty was use of all
quick-disconnects, so each "board" has one connector.

(It was definately an iterative design process)

The ONLY thing left in the car at the track was the wiring harness,
since the head is also pull out.

One last feature:  The speaker box also fits in my honda.  I bought an
extra cage for the head and an extra alpine DIN line ($125) , built a
small box into which the two amp boards fit and had serious stereo in
either car.

More than you wanted to know....no doubt!

Store it in a very dry location, in a heavy sealed plastic bag if

Some slow oxidation will occur; keeping the engine dry will minimize it.

   My 914/6 engine is freshly rebuilt - no engine oil in it yet.
   The Webers are not ready so I can't start the engine.
   Any suggestions on how to store it?

I would run oil through it by cranking it over with the starter
with plugs removed until you show oil pressure.  Then store with
full fresh oil and optionally squirt some into the plug holes.
Then I'd cover all openings, like the intake manifold where the
plugs should be with some cloth. 

If it's out of the car and no oil supply system is available then
just squirt some oil into the plug holes and let it sit. 

The oil in the cylinders will help to prevent the rings from
siezing on the cylinder walls and breaking when you try to crank
it later. There's only a slim chance this will happen though...

Regarding 912's

I bought a 912 '67 for $3K, but as Stan remarked the rods and cranks
were not too good, and broke; 
I put in a rebuilt engine + lots of welding to get
the steering and the suspension upto good condition (at an additional
5K (parts and labor) + 2 K).  I think for about 10K it is great deal
to drive.  I wish it had AC though - especially considering the summers
in Georgia.  

I don't like the way the fuse boxes are built in the 912s,
the fuse is balanced between two sprung holders, and very often work
loose, resulting in either the signal lights, or parking lights, or
the wipers mysteriously failing every other month - it always turns
out that the fuse has fallen off.

The early 911/912 were the same except for motors.  The gearbox was the

Look for RUST-CANCER!!! The early cars really had a problem with this,

to see if the engine is in good running order- I dropped a valve on mine
after driving it for 1 week and had to do $$$$ engine repairs.  I was told

As for the Car in Ca, these cars may be in good shape IF they were kept

If you don't end up buying this car, let me know (>please<), as I'm looking

After this, for the exterior, spraying silicone lubricant as a protective
coating on all exterior surfaces dooes a fantastic job of protecting
against corrosion.  I did this on a nearly new motorcycle that was stored
for over a year in a damp environment, teh bike is like new still.  It was
just kind of a pain wiping off the silicone.

Subject: 914/conversions


A few years ago I had a 72 914.  That chassis in my opinion was probably
the best I've ever driven.  I sold that 914 to further finance my
TR-6 project (another story).  I'm thinking of getting another 914
if it isn't completely rusted out but would like to modify it.  Now I'm
new to this list so I don't know if all of the members are Porsche
purists or not.  
     While on a business trip in LA I came across a garage which
does 911 and 914 'conversions'.  Actually the garage was across the street
from the contractor I was visiting in Santa Fe Springs.  At lunch
I walked over to the garage and introduced myself.  I found out that these
guys were putting 350 small block V-8's in 911's and 914's.  The owner
said that their customers were fed up with the high maintenance costs of
the flat-6 engines.  I was particularly interested in the V-8 conversions
on the 914 he had there.  The shop would put the V-8 in with the stock
transaxle but they didn't put much faith in its longevity.  The best
conversion was to throw out the stock 914 trans and replace it with
a 911 transaxle which they said was remarkably durable considering the
torque of the V-8.  Well I forget the 1/4 mile times he told me he
obtained with his converted 914 but I remember being impressed.  
    What I'm trying to find out is if there is any one on the list
who has done any type of engine conversion like this.  I personally wouldn't
mess with converting a 911....but a 914/4 could use some enhancement.

I'm not entirely happy with the current idle speeds on my '86 951. 
When I first start the car, it idles at about 700-750, which seems
too low  (car runs ragged for the first couple of minutes). When 
it's warm, it idles at about 1250-1300, which seems too high (car
runs fine; it just sounds unnecessarily fast to me).

I liked how the car ran and sounded a couple of tune-ups ago, but
it never occurred to me to jot down the idle speeds then so I
don't know what they were. I'd guess somewhere between 850-1150.

Does anyone have service manual or experiential information on

    But if you plan on driving in the winter, 
   you might want to go down to 225 or 205, as Kevin Gross suggested 
   (higher unit area loading - better in the snow / rain).

This is something that has bugged me for a while.  I mean, if you have
a 3000lb car resting on four tires inflated to (say) 30 psi, your
total contact patch is going to be 100 square inches, regardless of
tire width, right?  Sure, there are sidewall stiffness contributions,
etc., that could vary from tire design to tire design, but all of them
are flat if you let out the air.

Note that I am not disputing that wide tires are bad in snow
conditions (maybe narrow tires "cut through" the snow better or
something).  I'm just saying that if narrow tires are better, it isn't
because they have higher unit area loading.

My understanding is that the tread pattern and rubber compounding of
show tires is the real source of their improved bad-weather traction.
After all, even a narrow A008 would suck in bad weather.

Subject: Re: Early 912's

I can sympathize with having to do major engine repairs right after
buying a car.  Mine is being torn down as I write this.

Being a native Californian and having looked at quite a few 911's
before I bought my 1970 T, I can tell you the places I found rust in these
cars.  In the battery box(es) behind the headlights, around the chrome
trim around the headlights, rear lower 1/4er panels, lower right (facing
door) panel.  This varied anywhere from surface rust to actual deterioration
of the metal.  

Maybe I'm wrong, but in the 60's-early 70's  911/912 I would  assume
that this rust is almost normal due to the contruction of the car, and 
something more to be aware of rather than to expect to find a car with
no evidence of rust anywhere.

The car I bought (enigne bad luck aside) is pretty nice looking and has
the potential to be a very nice car, but I would not buy it again.  I'm not
sure what your goal is for your car, but my expeience with old cars is to
buy the BEST one you can afford, maybe that you can't afford.  Somehow I
got sucked in by a black body, sunroof and alloy wheels, and by the time
I get this car to the standards I want I'll have quite a bit in it.

You would of thought I'd have learned in the 5+ years I've spent trying to
get my 1967 Corvette the way I want it-*almost* too nice to drive.  Its
now kind of for sale while I'm looking for what I really want.

I spent lots of time in the jump seats, passenger seat and once or twice
the drivers seat of my friends parents '68 912 Soft Window Targa in junior
high and high school.  The memories of that car really influenced my decision
to buy a Porsche of the same vintage today.  Have fun.

Not really.  If you let all the air out of a tire, what shape does it  
assume without load?  How much force is required to flatten it?

There are two issues at work here.  First is tire construction and  
sidewall stiffness.  A tire made from steel and one made from balloon  
rubber would behave very differently under load.  More realistically,  
I run my bias-ply race tires at about 25 psi cold, while my  
competitors run their (same size) radials at about 35 psi.  Is my  
contact patch 40% larger?  I wish!  


In fact, bias-ply tires have much stiffer sidewalls than radials.   
Also, wide, low-profile tires will tend to have stiffer sidewalls  
than narrow, high-profile tires (which is why comfortable American  
sedans tend to have high-profile 70 series tires).  The (nonlinear)  
spring constant of tires actually becomes the dominant compliance in  
many race car suspensions, and, for example, Goodyear will give you  
data on the spring constant of their race tires, which is dependent  
on tire construction as well as pressure.

But even if tires behaved the way you postulate, narrow tires would  
still work better in heavy rain and snow.  What is important in these  
conditions is the _shape_ of the contact patch rather than its area.   
A long narrow contact patch will tend to cut through the hydroplane  
water film or through the snow surface, while a short wide contact  
patch will "float" above it.  Of course, tread design is also very  
important, which is why slicks don't work too well in the rain.

The spec for your car is 840 +/- 40 RPM.  Properly, it will idle a little
higher when cold, for a number of reasons.  Not sure what the cause of

Subject: RE: Rear defroster resistance

I just measure mine, first detaching the ground and power wires!  I saw
about 1 ohm.  This is a 944, but I would assume that any car would have
an impedence in roughly the same order of magnitude.

Btw, frequent failure point in 944's is the 6.3 mm female flat connector
in the black shell at the base of either hatch strut.  I guess the opening
and closing of the hatch stresses the wire, and it tends to break off.

Jeff, if your high impedence is because of damage to one of the main
metallic in-window wires, you can repair it with a silver-based touch-up
paint made just for that purpose.

I had the same problem twice this year. In early spring I had to replace
the passanger's side T-shaped washer (I thing I paid $6.88). Two months ago,
the driver's side washer got glogged. The dealer told me that those washers
brake all the time, and he suggested to punch through a hole so that they are
always on. The only function they provide is to prevent the fluid to 
return to the resevoir. This makes the response time of the pump practically
zero.  The dealer told that if I punch a hole I would notice a small delay
(1-2 secs). I did so, but the results were not very good. Sometimes it takes 
the pump a long time to inject the fluid (5-10 seconds), and the pump sounds 
much louder. What I decided to do is to order a bunch of them (the left washer 
has different shape than the right one) and replace them as needed. 
I have not tried what Kevin suggested (i.e., soak them in vinegar), but I
tried to unglogge them using warm water.  Very cheap design!!

Make sure the antenna amplifier is powered when the radio is on.
A convenient way to do this is to connect it to the stereo's
power antenna lead. I neglected to do this when installing a
stereo in my 1988 944 and the reception was quite awful. When
connected, however, it works very well.

Subject: Replacing 944/951 clock bulbs


I got a number of requests for my offered procedure for replacing the
clock bulb in 944/951s.  Since this seems to be a fairly common
problem, I would like to post it here, at least for the sake of our
archives.

 -Milo

____________________________________________________________________________

My approach to replacing the clock bulb in an 85.5+ 944 (inc. Turbo)
involves removing (at least partially) the part of the dash that
contains the hazard flasher switch, clock module and cigarette
lighter.  This is a long plastic strip that is attached to the dash at
four points.  To remove it:

1.  Remove the plastic plate that covers the heating/AC control unit
in the dash.  To do this, you must first pull off the knobs on the two
slider switches that control the vents that send air to your feet and the
windshield.  These are just pressed on and will come off with
a gentle tug.  The control unit face plate is also just pressed on,
and can be removed by gently prying it out with a screwdriver or putty
knife at several points.  Take your time with this, since the plate is
not very thick at some points and is easy to crack if bent too much.
After you have the plate off, unscrew the four Philips head screws
that mount the heating/AC control unit to the dash.  Slide the control
unit out about 1" to get it out of the way a bit (it is not necessary
to disconnect or remove it).

2.  Locate the passenger compartment temperature sensor, which is
under the round, 5-slotted grate immediately to the right of the
cigarette lighter.  Remove the grate by inserting a coin and rotating
the grate counterclockwise until it pops out.  Remove the small
Philips head screw underneath the sensor hole.

3.  Continuing to the right along the dash, locate the (approx .5" x
1.5") rectangular cover plate to the left of the side vent.  Gently
pry this plate off using the slot at the bottom.  Underneath, you will
see two Philips head screws that you will also remove.

4.  Finally, open the passenger side door and observe that the end of
the dash is covered by a plastic plate attached by a Philips head
screw at its center.  Remove the screw and the plate.  This will allow
you to then remove the last Philips head screw attaching the end of
plastic strip we are wanting to remove.

At this point, the only things holding the strip (other than a snug
fit) are the electrical connections to the hazard flasher switch,
clock, cigarette lighter (and its light bulb).  It is probably best to
go ahead and disconnect all of these so that you can completely remove
the strip and have easy access to the back of the clock (which comes
out with the strip).  You might be able to sneak a new bulb into the
clock with some of these connections still attached, depending on your
dexterity.

The clock bulb has a "squarish" base that protrudes from the back of
the clock module.  Simply rotate it 90 degrees, remove and replace it.
I'm not sure how common these bulbs are.  I got mine from an
independent repair shop, but dealers should definitely have it.

As they say "installation is the reverse of removal" :-).

Check with Automechanika (in Boulder, CO) or Race Force (in

under $400 at some point in the recent past (I paid $360 to
Automechanika for mine a few years ago).  I don't have any of my
magazines (e.g., Pano) in my office now, so I can't check the current
prices (or give the phone numbers).  However, I have been watching the
prices for a number of years and have not seen much movement; you
should not have to pay $500.  I have never seen any aftermarket
substitutes.

Oops, Automechanika is in Englewood, CO (not Boulder as I reported
earlier).  Their phone number is 1-800-582-2886 and their current

For those of you with cracked dashes, especially the ones that own
924/944 cars, read on.

I have been collecting information and have found three companies that
do this work in the USA.  I found other companies that sell 911 and
other European car dashes and do repairs.  These companies can restore
the 924 style dash.  They don't care about the condition of the dash.
They rebuild it from scratch, using some sort of vacuum forming
process.  The price range is from $335 to $430 for the 924 and takes 2
to 3 weeks I was told.  This compares to about $200 in Australia per
Kelvin Ross, who started me on this research project.  I really hate
the Dash-Topper / Coverlay fix.  Of course, you have to remove the dash
and live without the car for a couple of weeks...  Removing the dash is
the easy part.  Living without the car is something you learn to do
when you own a 931.  I forgot, you might have to justify the expense to
a significant other.  That could be the hardest part.

Subject: RE: 951 questions

Unit area loading is a product of tire contact patch size and car 
weight.  Since the car's weight is constant, the only thing you can do 
to increase the loading is to  make the contact patch smaller, i.e. get 
a narrower tire.  This has nothing to do with tire pressure, except to 
the extent that the contact patch changes width/length as the pressure varies.

For non-hydroplaning wet conditions, you are correct: the compound is 
the most significant contributor to grip / friction.

For hydroplaning (deep water) and snow, the tread pattern becomes 
dominant.  Decreasing the tread width in this situation helps push 
through the water/snow to pack it tighter or get to asphalt.  As an 
analogy, think of how a wide, flat rock skips across water very easily; 
a narrow, flat rock sinks quicker, which is what you want with a car.

Subject: RE: Idle speeds on 944/951?

The idle speed is controlled by the DME.  It actuates a servo valve 
that modifies the throttle bypass value.  If your idle is all over the 
place and doesn't stabilize *very* well at 840 rpm, then there's most 
likely something wrong.

The simplest thing to check is whether the servo is connected.  It's a 
silver "can" about 5 inches long, with a couple 1/2" (or so) hoses and 
an electrical connector.  It's mounted under the intake manifold, just 
about exactly under the plenum (the "tank" that the 4 intake tubes connect to).

If this checks OK, a mechanic should probably look at it.  It's not a 
tough job to  debug or fix, but it's a little involved.

I believe all 944 series cars have the same idle specification, within 
a few 10's of revs.

As for info: this may SOUND like a brush off but it isn't:

Call Polk.  They are VERY helpful and will sell you their current line
of car audio.  Ask for specific info in the 6903, 6902, 4600 and mm1001
(or the models that supercede) and a sheet with all their dealers.

I don't have thir number, but hey are in Baltimore MD, 1-410-555-1212
should do it.  They have a customer service staff.

Polk (fortunately or not) sels only through dealers, no mail order types
(at least not with thier knowledge).

Here's thire 6x9 model line

6900 - 3 way, basically a 6901 with a pedisal mounted mm1001 in the
center fr a triaxial effect

6901 sub-woofer. 100 watts RMS power (no kidding either), 32-1500 Hz
6902 A package consisting of 6901 + mm1001a (separately moutable)

mm1001a md-high module, 2 speakers, pers side 1500-20,500 Hz

As with the above, their model designations follow the same pattern:

6502 = 6501 + mm1001
6500 not available

6501 = 6 1/2 " woofer/sub 
       38-1500 Hz, 100 W RMS 

5501  5.25"  40-1500Hz, 75 Watts

4600 4x6"  75-15,000 Hz, 5-50 WPC RMS

That's about 2 years old, but they are pretty stable.  The also offer a
sub:

MM1025  10"  25-1000Hz, 200 WPCRMS


Effieciencies are all pretty hight (in the 92-96DB range).

I suugest getting a passive crossover and running 1 amp per speaker
pair.

As for pricing:  Polks are NOT cheap!

6900 - $240
4600   $65
mm1001  $120
mm1025  $140

These are ballparks, but are not too far off.  Do't expect too much of a
discount.

Even more info (I'm avoiding studying)

In my opinion, forget the Alpine and put a Blaupunkt Atlanta SQR49 in  
your car. For about $515+40(guess) shipping from the UK (17.5%US  
import tax included) you get:

	A German radio
	24 presets on FM
	8 Presets on LW,MW,SW (Am and SW)
	All 3 major SW bands
	Excellent tuner overall
	Tape system with Dolby B,C,DNR,Cassette search,etc 

	(Sounds excellent)
	Scan features on all frequencies
	Head unit for the Blaupunkt CD changer

I could go on... Not sure if it has ARI or if I am thinking about the  
Bremen (ARI is useless in the States)

Plus installing it would take about 2 minutes (Shouldn't require any  
rewiring or adapters or...) becuase your car was probably wired for  
Blaupunkt.

Additionally, because it is made for the European mkt, the radio is  
made IN Germany (the same people who made your car :-) as opposed to  
a US model BP, which is made under contract in Japan.

If enough people are interested, maybe we can all order them at once  
and get a group discount//save on shipping and so forth//make a  
briton very happy. My friend has one in his BMW, and I am quite  
impressed with the quality of the FM and SW reception as well as the

Yes, I confess, I did buy one of the Imparts kits a few years ago.  I
think it was a pretty sensible thing to do, and have gone to it a lot
of times for the odd bolt, washer, or nut.  It makes a good starter, which
you can feed (as I have) on an as-needed basis.

The dealer prices may seem a little high, but I really try to figure into
the equation the economics of time: just how much time do I want to waste
saving 50 cents on a stupid bolt?

There are certainly lots of other sources for correct hardware.  Locally
(eastern Mass.), there is Bel-Metric, but they are pricey even to the
trade.  Nationally Wurth is there with all the fasteners, electrical parts,
and potions you could ever want.  But they have a $40 minimum order.  Best
bet there is to either pool an order with your pals, or buy what you need
plus a case of HHS-2000 (eg) and sell it off at your next PCA meeting!

Me, I give most of my business to my dealer's parts guy.  Speaking of the
economics of time, he (Mack) has wasted endless amounts of time tracking
down little parts for me which do not appear in the 'fiche.  So I have no
problem "compensating" him by paying a little more than rock-bottom on more
common parts.  He is a great guy.

Kevin

PS: If you do order from Wurth, they sell this set of terrific flex-shaft
hex drivers.  I have covetted my mechanic's for a couple years, and finally
got a set last week.  Specifically for hose clamps, they flex, and they
break away before you can over-torque.  So cool - you gotta have the toys!

I am having terrible luck getting parts for my 931 via the Porsche dealer at
Syracuse. My current order, for a few fuel lines, an exhaust to turbo
gasket, and some odds and ends, has been hanging for about 5 weeks now. The
story is that most of the parts I ordered have to come from Germany, hence
their story is that a 90 day wait is not to be unexpected. My last round of
phone calls garnered the promise that the parts will be in Syracuse by the 16th
of December.
My questions: Since all of the dealers supposedly get parts out of Reno, is
it still the case that some dealers are able to obtain parts faster than
others? If parts are backordered, are they pulled from American dealers before
resorting to a trip to Germany? My theory is that a dealer who sold a great
whack of 931's might have a higher probability of having the parts I need in
stock, than say a new dealer, like Syracuse. Any suggestions on how to
determine up front, which dealer is likely to get the parts to me fastest?
It seems to me that any parts order dragging on for more than a week in this
day and age is pretty much ridiculous.  Am I expecting too much?

regarding dashboard repair:

in 1988, I had occasion to use Just Dashes to repair the badly cracked dash
of my 1960 Cadillac Coupe DeVille.  the dash was big (twice as wide as my mini)
and had lots of curves. they did a real nice job for $400.

My experience with Stoddard has been the same as Hurf's.  I always get
good, competent help; they ship by the next day at the latest; and
if they have to back-order a part, it always arrives within a couple 
of weeks.  If you're in a hurry, they'll even ship via one of the next
day delivery services.  And since they have an 800 number (800-342-1414),
it's often far easier to order from Stoddard than to drive over to my
local dealer!  I've bought lots of parts from them, and I'm a very 
satisfied customer.  BTW, their catalog is full of good exploded 
drawings for all models of Porsches.

I believe that is not true, if you assume that the dominant mechanism
supporting the car is the air pressure in the tires, rather than the
intrinsic stiffness of the sidewalls. To test this hypothesis, let the
air out. Seriously, you would need some way to measure a spring constant
for a deflated tire to accurately assess the relative contributions of
the sidewall and the air pressure on the contact patch, but I believe
you would find that the the air pressure is the dominant mechanism, by
a wide margin. Once you accept this assumption, the area of the contact
patch is in fact inversely proportional to the tire pressure (and
directly proportional to the weight on that tire).

As others have noted, the issue in the rain (and in the dry, but the other
way around) is the shape of the patch. A long, narrow contact patch from a
narrow tire only has to clear the water from a relatively narrow
stripe of the road, and the rest of the contact patch follows in the
same cleared width.

As others have noted, tread design, and to a lesser extent rubber
compound, are also important, and perhaps dominant in assessing wet
performance of a given tire. As you note, the relative importance of
these depends on whether you are in hydorplaning conditions.

Subject: what is...

Hi - while rummaging around in the front of my '69 912 yesterday, I
found some hoses whose function is not entirely clear to me.  I'll
try to explain...

From the top of the gas tank, a 1/2" clear hose runs up to a little
plastic box right under the windshield cowling.  a 1/4" clear hose runs 
out of the same box down to the vicinity of the washer reservoir.

questions:

1. what is the little plastic box i'm describing?
2. should the 1/4" hose empty to the "outside", or to the spare tire
well as it is now?

comments:

a. the bottom of the spare tire well (near where the 1/4" hose terminates)
is kind of sticky.

b. i smell gas for two minutes after filling up (i don't top the tank).
could this be related to (a) ??

c. the 1/2" hose is hard as a rock.  can i replace with standard
car-parts tubing, or is a special material required?

thanks...

Well, we finally had some decent amount of rain here in the S.F.
Bay area and I had a chance to see how my Dunlop SP Sport 8000
tire would do.

I have to admit, they did much better than I though they would. I
have 225/45ZR16s in the front and 245/45ZR16s in the rear of my
'78 911SC. I expected more of a hydroplane effect than I got. My
Goodyear Eagles (205/55 and 225/50) were not nearly as good as the
Dunlop tires for wet cornering and the Eagles hydroplaned more
quickly and at lower speeds.

REGARDING                Dirt and 914's
Hello again.
    I had promised myself some time under the car this weekend, so I finally
took the time to try opening up the outer rocker panels.  Only the driver's
side would go--I'm going to hit the other side with Liquid Wrench as soon as I
can find some dry ground to do it on.
    Well, I was simply amazed at the amount of crap that came out of that
thing.  I had a pile of what must have been at least a pound of dirt!  Not to
mention all the gravel, some sort of splined metal piece about 2 or 3 in. long,
and a candy wrapper (!).
    When I looked carefully, I saw that there was a hollow right in front of
the jack point, and this hollow was connected to the engine compartment or
wheel well by a narrow passage.  I'm not sure why this was done, but it allowed
astounding quantities of crap to accumulate.
    I guess I would like to add my voice to the others that I've heard :
"Please clean out those rockers!  Hosing out the wheel wells and jack points is
_NOT_ enough!"  That should (at least) slow the rot that leads to flexy fliers.
 Heck, if the top of the rocker wasn't riveted on, I would have just popped the
whole thing off!
    There actually is a question in all of this, that being :  How often
(roughly) should I be doing this?  Every week seems a bit frequent, but two
years is definitely far too long.  Although I doubt the previous owner ever
checked, himself.

Heh, did you go to pick up your car only to find out that your mechanic had one

That probably wouldn't hurt the system - it might blow up the can however.
If you let your car go a year without using the AC, your compressor may

Steve, your original message came to me as a non-delivery notice.  So
I'm unsure who exactly it was addressed to.

I cannot offer a lot of help myself.  The failures I have heard of are
either one of the hoses or the expansion valve (I think it's called).
The hoses are expensive, and in at least some cases, apparently a real
pain to replace.  Sounds like you have a leak - I mean, by definition
if you're losing freon, either you have a leak or they mixed a black
hole in with your freon at the factory.

I live in New England and plan to rip my AC out of the car at the first
sign of trouble.  So it is almost guaranteed never to fail...

If you can get at the rocker area with a hose when you wash the car, I'd
wash them out whenever I washed the car.  Esp. with the non-galvinized
cars.

944's have a similar terrarium behind the front wheels.  It is behind the
plastic well liner and trails rearwards.  You can just get a nozzle up and
into it.  If you have never done so, you're in for a surprise!  It also
makes sense to hose the front spring perches and the lip at the back of
the rear wheel well.

Everyone deals with Reno, which means that any part can be had overnight
or in no more than three days, depending on what you want to pay.  Best
bet is to get a friendly parts guy to piggyback your order on something
like a warranty work parts order which is going overnight.  In New England,
some of the dealers have recently started computerized sharing of parts
inventory info, which can be a help.  Alas, in 1992 I don't think any dealer
inventories (m)any 931-specific parts.

A number of years ago, I read that the MPH speed at which a car hydroplaned
was roughly ten times the square root of the tire pressure in PSI.  So,
for example, a 36 PSI tire will hydroplane at 60 MPH, and a 25 PSI tire
at 50 MPH.

Stan, I'm no tribologist and have rebuilt very few engines.  I defer to
your experience!  But from both my experience and reason, I'm not
convinced by what you've said.  The point of a multi-grade oil's design
is stabilization of its lubricating properties across a range of operating
conditions (temperatures).  I don't know what it is in a street engine's
design which could favour a single-weight oil, per se.  A 40W is going
to lubricate a lot less like a nominal 40W oil in the range of ambient and
engine temperatures a street car is likely to see, than a 20W50 or 10W40.

(Btw, to say that an early engine was "designed for a single grade oil" is
kind of moot, since that was all that was available then!)

Or am I missing something here?  Could be.  Let me know, guy.

    If I may add something here (as a veteran 914-er).
   Washing out the 914's undercarriage is fine and dandy, but over the
   years, pressure washing your ungalvanized body will just force the
   corrosion generating moisture INTO the seams of the body.
    This is really bad.
   Over time, the body seam caulk seems to harden, and if a disturbance
   such as a solid bump to the body occurs, then the caulk becomes
   loosened, inviting more disaster.  Unfortunately, the 914 body
   is not as stiff as everyone would like, this too results in displacement
   of body sealers in places like the rocker tie-ins.
   To prevent corrosion it may be necessary to (1) keep your car clean
   and dry as much as possible [move to arizona]. and (2) (re)treat the
   body to a wax-based coating inside the rockers and other inner sanctums
   these P-cars have.
   
   Does anyone out there have long-term results (good or bad) from using
   these 'waxoyl' products?

Subject:      Radar Detector Summary

I recently conducted an independent survey of radar detector owners/users.

Well, the results are in.  The response was overwhelming (About 50+
responses)!  And the winner is . . . (drumroll) . . .

                        The VALENTINE 1!

Seems that Mike Valentine, co-inventor/founder of Cincinnati Microwave
in 1978 has since decided to build his own detector (since the g-analyst is
selling well and is not being improved any time soon).  The result, the
Valentine 1, appears to be an impressive weapon against all X/K/Ka band
radar guns.  It has antennas in front and back and indicates much more
than just signal strength (such as how MANY signals there are and which
direction they're coming from) and is invisible to VG-2 radar detector
detectors.  Unfortunately, the unit has some drawbacks as well.  Cost is
$299 - available by direct mail only - current delivery time is JUNE (I
called today) and the ergonomics of the unit aren't perfect . . .  maybe
they'll come out with the Valentine 2 by the time I take delivery.

Unfortunately, BTW, nobody has actually USED one of these Valentine units
yet.  Everything is "read" and "heard" type info.  If you get one soon,
please let those of us who are on the waiting list know if it's really as
good as everyone says.

In case anyone who has seen their ad is wondering about the "stealth kit,"
it's a 2" module you can stick anywhere on the dash that links to the main
unit and acts as an alternative display.  That way, you can run the
detector in "dark" mode without sacrificing anything.

As far as the other detectors are concerned, all of them got fairly good
reviews from owners.  Here's a summary:

Bell:
    + All around good units.  Long range.  Good features.  Quick delivery!
    & ST units are shielded against VG-2 detectors
    & Offering $20-$40 rebates until December 31, 92

    - Tends to false a lot on Ka band.  High price.  Ergonomics.

    quotes: "I am continually amazed by the range which it provides"
            "I have two Bell detectors that are installed under the hoods
             of my Vettes.  They seem to work fine; I have never gotten a
             speeding ticket in either Vette."

Whistler:
    + Ergonomics & features.  NO false alarms.  Wireless remote (5000SE)

    - High price.  Not quite as much range.  Not VG-2 shielded

    quotes: "great looks, loaded with features"
            "... failed to induce either Whistler to bleat a single false
             alarm in town, an engineering triumph."
            "I've picked up coppers a mile plus away with it."

Escort/Cincinnati Microwave:
    + Ergonomics & features.  Quality.  Prices are dropping!  Reputation.

    - Some false alarms & not quite the range.  Not VG-2 shielded.

    quotes: "I had really good luck with my past Escort and Uniden units"
            "I've been using Passport for about five years and am very
             pleased with it."

Uniden:
    + Features & price.  Good range.  Some VG-2 shielding.

    - False alarms on X and Ka.  Ergonomics (buttons on new units).

    quotes: see Escort above
            "I have escaped MANY tickets with this unit.  The range is
             excellent, even from behind.  In many ways, this unit is
             similar to the Passport (I've owned one), only cheaper."

THANKS to EVERYONE who participated in my survey.  I wish you all the best
of luck in ticket avoidance.  Now if only I could find a good LIDAR
detector . . .

    Dave,
    Eessh; is your jack point able to lift the car using the oem jack?
    Or does it go crunch?
    From your description, it sounds like you are looking at the outer
    longitudinal which forms a major part of the 'frame' of the car.
    If so, the longitudinal should not have holes in it except for the
    jack mount and tube.  I dont want to be the one to give bad news,
    but your car may already be on its way to becoming a flexy flyer
    if the long is perforated.  There may be other damage waiting to
    be discovered, judging from your post.
    As for cleaning intervals, I would say on an 'as needed' basis.
    But there is hope... I have seen offered in Excellence and Mid-Engine
    Views (periodicals) a set of fender well liners for 914's ($99/4).
    Me thinks I will procure a set of these after I get my car back
    together (after repairing MY longitudinals, etc.)
    The vendor that has these liners is: Part Werks of Chicago@ 800-366-9147.
    Good Luck, and hang in there.

Subject: Porsche 4WD System


Does anyone have a good reference to a description of the 4WD system
Porsche use in the 911 Carrera 4?  I seem to recall reading an article
about the 959 (some years ago) that implied Porsche didn't use a
viscous coupling but rather some other form of mechanical coupling.
The article claimed that a viscous coupling wouldn't be able to
respond fast enough for the 959, and that some form of 'hard' coupling
was used.


So does anybody have any details on the 959 system, is it the same
type of system used on the C4, and what are the pros and cons of
viscous/fixed couplings?

Thanks

I recall one interesting fact about the 4WD systems Porsche uses:  the 
959 diffs. locked in 0.3 seconds.  The C4 is a bit better, at 0.1 
seconds.  I don't recall if it's viscous or just what - try an old

The Ghost Racing EP 914 (Weber 40 IDFs, 3" velocity stacks, soft foam filters)

It is called "the loud pedal" ...

You could put sonex on the surrounding panels or try to build a 
larger foam baffle box around the intakes but anything you do
besides those will restrict air flow. A loose foam filter
will eat more noise than one held tightly in wire. If you can
put sonex on the closer reflecting panels that will do 
about as well as anything.

(Sonex is an anechoic foam )

Stumped, are you? Perhaps you'ld be better off if you were "baffled".

Seriously, baffles may well be the way to go. How do the tops of your air
filters relate to the engine compartment lid? Is there room to set up baffles?

This would certainly cut down on noise, add weight, and decrease pressure.
Weight added could be reduced through appropriate choice of materials.
Pressure drop will depend on the width of the openings and the separation
of the baffles.

Yes, they are legal in production, especially with the new rules about
to be published.

The best I have seen is a naca duct (about $30 for a good plastic one)
from the driver's right headlight nacelle.  This is ducted to a four
or 5 inch diamater flexible Pipe (exhaust ducting for home furnaces,
available at a hardware store), through the passenger compartment and
into the engine compartment, to a splitter, and then to the carbs.

This has the advantage of sucking cold air, getting ram-air from the
front, and being able to filter well in front of the carbs.

When I get the time, I'm going to run a pipe from the headlight of my
spitfire to the carbs, in the same manner.

Another question:  you said you make 108db.  I assume this means you
failed on sound checks.  In SFR, our noise limit is 103db at 50ft.  Is
your 108 at 50ft. or at 3 ft.  I believe the GCR's require 50 ft.

We use a similar arrangement on a race 911.  The NACA duct is fitted into
a Lexan rear side window, and flows from there through  Mercedes-Benz
induction pipe (about 3 1/4" if I recall) to and through the fire wall.
You can get this kind of hose in a wide range of sizes and materials from
houses like McMaster-Carr.

	Road and Track ran a special issue on Porsches in early 1990 for
the C4's debut.  In it they describe the system as having a center
differentail that uses electronicaly controled multidisk arrangement to
send 31% of the power to the front and 69% to the rear.  Using the ABS
sensors the computer distrubutes power accordinally.  Of course both the
front and rear differentials are limited slip as well.  The center diff.
can also be locked so that all four wheels drive at the same time.  A
viscouis coupling uses a silicone based oil that thickens as a series of
plates slip against each other.  Subaru uses this type on their Legacy
sedans. It is probably less controlable than the ones used on the C4.  Its
a niffty system that works very well from what I have  heard.

We already do this (or something like it) to get cooling air to the engine.
So, making an induction system this way would not be a  big deal. Thanks for

Well, if you shift into 5th and go by at ~4200 RPM, or if you coast past the

There was a amusing incident a year or so ago in one of the IMSA GTP
races.  They were racing in a community which had strict sound
restrictions.  As a result, there was a microphone mounted on one of
the walls which monitors the cars as they go by.

Unfortunately, this was unfair to some of the cars since some have
their exhaust on the left and some on the right, one group was going
to be inherently lounder.  

One team (I can't remember which) had been given stop&gos twice for
exceeding the sound levels.  If they had one more violation they were
going to be pulled from the race.  On the lap after leaving the pits
after the second stop&go, the driver "accidentally" brushed the wall
where the microphone was located, destroying the sound monitoring station.

I believe the driver was later fined, but was able to continue the race.

I'm not suggesting you try this!  :-)

It was the Dyson team, and the description I read was that the driver "ran
over" the equipment.  Yes, they were measuring on one side only of
the track, which penalized the 962 unfairly.  They beat the penalty on
appeal, I believe.

Btw, I know of a car whose owner cut then rewelded at an angle the ends of
his Supertraps, which would otherwise come straight out the back but which
now have a 45 degreee angle for their last few inches.  This knowing the
spot and side at which noise is measured at his favourite track.

Subject: Leaks

Well, I patched up the plug on the rear passenger floorpan on my  
944S, and water STILL keeps pooling on the passenger floor.  
Aarrggh!!!

Well, at least I seem to have traced the problem as follows: The  
water appears to be coming in to the rear floorpan from the FRONT of  
the car, through a trough that goes under the passenger seat mount &  
seat. This probably means that water is coming in off the hood, under  
the foward passenger floorpan (it looks like that is a double floor  
for the front pans, so the water is between the pans) and merrily  
going to the back because I park my car on a small incline with the  
rear down where it pools and drives me bannanas.

Parking the car with the nose downward seems to keep the water  
problem down, but this is not a very good solution... At this point,  
the water could be coming in from anywhere up front, and if it is  
getting trapped between the floorpans, I WILL have rust in no time  
flat, which really worries me.

Any suggestions, or should I take this one to Porsche and see if it  
is covered under the 10 year "Rust//Body integrity" warranty?

This is SOP for quite a few cars in the San Francisco region.  They
move sound check around, so it has to be adjustable.

There's the simple: a curved chunk of sheet metal that gets
hose-clamped to the supertrapp, extending past the back of the pipe,
on the side toward sound.

And the elegant:  The complete diffuser on a piece of 90 degree
pipe, bolted onto the back of the exhaust pipe with a 4 bolt flange.
An equally spaced four bolts, I might add.

This is well within the rules.

Have you checked the battery box for rust? I had a serious problem with
that on the 931; when I parked nose up in the rain the water would just
come streaming down from the dash.  I believe the entry point was along
the (absent) seam between the bottom of the box and the inside fender. 
There's a drain plug in front of the battery that gets clogged frequently
with organic matter that finds its way down the windshield and under the
hood; this helps to maximize the amount of water that ends up inside. 

The problem as I experienced it was so obvious that you would have noticed
it by now; your leak, however, may be in an area that wouldn't cause a
visible drip.

Good Luck,

I've had them on my 84 Carrera for about 5 months.  Street use only.
For the money they have been excellent.  My only complaint is they
ride really stiff.  Too bad they don't sell Fulda Y2000's anymore.

can probably retrim the squab, but will only sell me the cloth in a metre
length (approx 39 ins) of 51 inch wide cloth at a cost of between UK#70
and UK#80.

	The cloth in question is a beige pinstripe for a 1985.5 UK spec.
944, and the part number for the cloth is TPC 000 000 00 9BX.

	Two questions:

	1. Does anyone sell cloth in smaller (or cheaper!) quantities than
1 metre?

	2. Will my passenger seat fit onto the drivers seat rails (I have
the electric sport seats fitted)? I use the car every day to get to work
and can't afford to be without it while the trimmer is working on it.

P.S. I'm in the process of buying a house with a garage. Has anyone any
experience in digging out an inspection pit so that they can work under
their car? I've seena couple of houses (which I sadly didn't like) which
had this feature and I thought it would be really useful; I'm just
wondering how easy/expensive/feasible it would be to "retrofit" one.

Hi,

I am a relative newcomer, who has been searching for a 911 for a few months.
This weekend I think I found a good one. Its a '71 911E that looks to be in
good to excellent(maybe) condition. I checked the body (a few dimples and 1 
scratch), the undercarriage (no rust, very clean), the engine (very clean, almost too clean considering what I've heard about oil leaks in general), the interior, etc.  Visually it looks really good, hey even the clock works! I plan to havea mechanic pressure test the engine, and check the alignment of the chasis, as well as look at a little oil leak from the transmission. The owner said he would have his mechanic look/fix the trans. leak. What I would like to know from the 
porsche gurus out there is, have I forgetten anything, is there a critical
check I should perform to keep this car from exploding into a canary yellow
fireball as I drive it home on the freeway :). Other than the engine/transmission, there doesn't seem to be that much more to check?

One more thing, for the So Cal readers, does anyone recommend any mechanics in the
West L.A. / South Bay area who I can take it to for the shakedown?

Many thanks

    Actually, it doesn't SEEM to be a rust perforation.  It looks like this

chewing gum or duct tape or whatever that the previous owner used to fix them
finally came off.  Grr.
    I was going to take it in & rebuild it in the next month or so, and I guess
this is just one more reason.  Probably right after X-mas.  Oh, well, who needs

Then Kevin Gross responds with a good description from the workshop manual.

I have an '89 S2 and managed to change the airfilter without the aide of the
workshop manual.  It does require removing lots of hardware and some special
care in removing the painted nose piece so not to scratch anything, but the
manual is not required.  A 6 inch extension for a 10mm socket is helpful as is
a flashlight for snooping around for the unobvious fasteners.  Once the nose
piece is off, you find 3 rubber straps that open up the filter box.  My first
replacement filter was wrong, a 944S item.  It was only slightly shorter and
wider.  The correct part# is 94411016600.  The S part# is 94411018800.  The
shop that sold me the part was very appologetic and traded me, so I got more
practice in the filter replacement.

Fred's other comment about the owner's manual is an interesting one that I also
don't understand.  My owner's manual has no reference to a 944 S2 model, only
the 944 and the Turbo.  Is this the case with all S2's, or has there been a
manual update to include them? I purchased an S2 service book from a dealer,
WKD 496 021 for under $7 which has good information.  It tells dealers what's
different to service on new models and was printed 4/89.

There has been some discussion about workshop manuals. I understand there are
6 volumes for the 944 and an additional 1 for the Turbo, plus supplements.
Is there a volume for the S2? I would like to purchase a set someday but the
price for the full set is a bit high. Would I get most of the pertinent S2 info
if I purchased only the Turbo volume along with the supplements and how much
would this cost?

For the rest of you 931 owners (probaby 944 owners too) with sticking

There is a flat rubber bumper about 1" in diameter and perhaps 3/8"
thick that stops the clutch return.  The clutch pedal lands off center
of the bumper.  135K miles of pounding beats a groove on one side and
allows the clutch to return too far, causing a wierd gyration of the
return spring which keeps the pedal down a bit.  I fixed the problem,
at least temporarily, by rotating the bumper 180 degrees.  It works!
No tools required.  Just stand on your head with a flashlight like you

You really should keep the G50 on the 3.2. Really. You'll probably blow up a
915 or certainly blow up a 901 with that engine. Assuming it still mates
to the bell housing (I honestly don't know that it will or won't mate.)

The madmen at Ghost Racing have a '70 911T up in the air right now, 
getting the same transplant. There are a few tricks:

* you have to remove the rear torsion bars and cut the torsion housing
  in half to fit the G50 into that tub. Have to make transmission mounts,
  too.

* to make the rear suspension work, you then have to go to coil-over
  in the rear. We are using a Carrera setup, modeled on the RSR and 935
  parts.

* while you're doing that, you discover that you *REALLY* need to weld
  in a full cage with support for the motor and transmission mounts

* we think that to balance the handling, we'll need adjustable coil-over
  suspension in the front, too.

  And then we're gonna need to do the brakes to deal with this huge amount
  of extra power... Probably Wilwood SuperLite IIs or some such...

* since we're doing the cutting and welding and engineering ourselves, and
  since the 3.2 and G50 are "free" (sunk costs from another project), the 
  total out-of-pocket looks like about $950 for the rear coil overs, including
  new shocks, about $900 for front RSR coil overs, including the new shocks,
  about $1300 for the brakes and new vented rotors, plus another $200 in 
  materials for making adapters, and about $600 for the cage.


I'll let you know how it works when it's done, sometime after Xmas.

Fred,

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but...
If you can, jettison the Acura as soon as you can.  I owned an '87 Integra
RS with the auto.  At first, my problems started out the same, only to
become worse to the point where the clutch pack went to pieces and
eventually chewed most of the tranny (read $1,600 for a rebuild).  The
dealership wanted $2,300!  They ended up replacing the clutch pack,
torque converter and one of the gear sets.  I watched them taking it
apart and it was ugly.  This was particularly bothersome because I
had followed the book regarding tranny fluid replacement and had
used good fluid.

The shop
that did the rebuild on mine told me of some sort of
retaining ring that holds the clutch pack that has a history
of failure at around the 80K mile mark.  My Integra had
roughly 89K miles on it.
 

If you intend upon keeping the car, I would
strongly recommend that you take it in to a reputable shop and have
it checked out.  You may be able to get by with only a minor rebuild
instead of what I had to fork out.  Suffice to say, I will NEVER buy
another Honda product with an automatic transmission. 


RE: Amsoil tranny goo...
Once a Honda tranny starts to go, you're toast.  I've had several people
say that using such treatments on normally functioning transmissions may
cause them to last longer.  This may be the case.  It most likely will
not fix something that's already failing.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  I hope by catching this early
you can spare yourself the grief that I encountered.

Good Luck,
Drew

 PAR is very good in terms of used parts.  Back in 1983, I bought a
'77 924 (SCCA car) from them and found out that they made 300% on the
final sale amount.  Of course, I can't complain after the fact, but I'd
advise you to first try and speak to vehicle owners themselves before
dealing with any car sales operations.

 Again, they're great for parts and other miscellaneous things.  The
owner's name is Paul and, personally, I always try and deal with him
first as he will reliably give one the bottom line (same advice applies
in most any situation - talk first with the Boss).

 All in all, I'm a satisfied customer.

I think the 915 will work. The 84-86 Carrera used the 915 gearbox with
the 3.2 which was essentially the same gearbox from the earliest 915
from the early 70's. The transmission (915) must have the bellhousing
modified to make clearance for the flywheel sensor's that the 3.2
DME needs. This is quite easily done if you have a template to work
from. As you already know the G50 does not bolt into a pre '87 911
body because of torsion tube clearance problems.

What a considerate guy!  Not knowing your brothers or their interests,
it's a little hard to make truly useful suggestions.  However, here
go:

1. If they are not PCA members, spend the extra eleven bucks and sign
'em up.  Read the VIN's off their cars' A-pillars, then call up Ruth
Harte at PCA's executive office 703-922-9300.  All she needs is the
VIN, name and address, and your credit card number.  If they're already
members, and they haven't tried autocrossing, buy them an entry into
an event.

2. Driving gloves.  Racer Wholesale has Bell single-layer gloves on
sale at $29.95, double at $39.95.  800-886-7223.

3. Tire pressue gauge, prices vary.

4. Passport radar detector holder from Vasek Polak, 310-376-7434.

5. Driving gloves.  Someone (my mom, I think) bought me a set of black
leather ones when I bought my car.  You know, the kind with the knuckle
cut-outs.  I feel silly every time I put them on, but they are so
incredibly comfortable, esp. for long trips.

6. OEM mirror bras.  The best.

7. If they do work on their cars, an assortment of Wurth potions.  Suggest:

  HHS 2000 penetrating lubricant
  Contact OL and Contact OS electrical cleaner and preserver, resp.
  Rost Off
  Rubber Care
  CU-800 anti-seize

8. Rubber pad for hydraulic floor jack, which replaces the usual metal
cup and obviates the need for that block of wood.  Only seen it available
from Griots (who are otherwise silly and overpriced).  (PS: If Santa's on
the list, *hint* *hint*, I would like one.)

I stop in there from time to time in route from NYC to Elmhurst
and/or White Plains. I'm not real impressed. They seem to have some
idea what they're doing, but the building isn't in what you'd call
an impressive part of town, the "show room" is usually almost completely
bare, and they seem to want way too much for everything they're selling,
including used parts.

Mind you, I buy used parts from what, about 20 different recyclers across
the US, plus individuals. At any given moment in time, I usually know within
5% what a given use part should be sold for -- or bought for, if you're doing
it as a business (NOT the same price, natch). These guys are way high on
the selling side and way low on the buying side. 

Other than that, I don't know much. They've been around forever, though...

P.S. Be sure to deal with Paul, if you do anything at all with them...

Re: all the discussion on radar detectors.

Has anyone tried out the "Jammer" sold by Dealer Marketing in Bonita Beach, FL

I received their literature yesterday and the unit purports to be able to 
defeat radar on x, k and ka by PASSIVE jamming.  the description states that 
the unit contains a white noise generator, a mixer and antennas for the three
frequencies. when it receives a radar signal it is mixed with the white noise
and reflected out the antenna.

the literature says that the unit is not a transmitter, but just reflects
radar signals.  the effect stated is that the comparator in the radar gun
becomes confused by the reflected signal and reads a blank or a lower speed

Subject: G50 vs 915...

A general comment:

The assumption that a 915 will hold together using a 915 gearbox is iffy...

The increase torque of the 3.2 can give trouble to the 915, especially if
its an early 915 (from a '72 car), since there was some internal oiling
problems associated with this design.  Corrected in '73 though..

I've heard of stories that the 915 will handle the torque of a small
block Chevy.... But I'd be careful!  Given the modifications required to
get the tranny in, I would first get your 3.2 in and see if you like it.
It should fit in just fine, but the clutch/flywhell required may
be different.  Ask Dwight (see below).  If your car has the original
tranny (a 901 actually), it would probably not hold up to a 3.2's torque.

You may want to take your 2.2, add oil squirters and find a set of 2.8 P/S.
This combined with as set of E or S cams will make a more that SCREAMS.....
(make sure you get your mech. inj. pump re-worked- a great combo...).

A good contact for this tranny business is my mentor, Dwight Michell [who
owns Autosport in Ca], at (916) 453-1465.  Linda, his wife, partner and
racer usually answers the phone.  Be prepared for Dwight to call you only
at night.... he's VERY busy during the day!  (tell him I sent you....)

Good luck and G'day,

Uh, I think they're pulling your leg here, Jim.  By simple definition, 
if a signal leaves your car ("reflects", as they say) that wasn't sent 
in by the Police radar, then you *are* transmitting.  Sound to me like 
they're trying to make signal mixing be like cake batter mixing: "Oh, 
no, we didn't send that arsenic out, we just mixed it with the batter 
than we received!".

A passive jammer would be one that either absorbs the microwave energy, 
or one that upsets the reflected signal physically, such as by a 
rotating metal plate (or the foil strips used in WWII, dropped by planes).

Sorry, that's not how electronics works!

Hi everyone,

My question is: how much oil should a SC consume on the average.
I average about one qt. every 500 miles.  

Also, I'm putting a rear window wiper (being in Seattle I think it's 
justified) and I'm not sure where the switch should be.  Can I use 
the existing relays?  Is the car already wired for this?

One last thing.  The clutch is really hard to press and it is not the

The car is a 1975.

Thanks to all about the PAR problems.  I will definitely be wary.

The subject of a 'good' transmission has come up.  One of my finest summers
consisted of salvaging all sorts of goodies from a wrecked '79 924.  One of 
the big things I got out of it was a completely rebuilt engine with only 3K on it. The other was a 5 speed tranny.  Yet, since I have a '77 924, and could not
shell out the cash for a new drive tube, and the 5 speed has sat in my garage for
a few years.  I would like to sell it, but I really don't know if it is shot or
not.  I would not like to sell a good tranny to someone for a mere pittance, nor
would I like to sell someone a bad tranny at an inflated price.  What is the
best way to check out the tranny?  Send it to a reputable shop? 

And while we are on the subject of trannies, is it possible to change the 
transmission fluid in 924 without removing the tranny?  I've looked around
on the tranny that I have in the garage, and I don't see where I can put in
tranny fluid, unless the thing is turned upside down (since there is some sort
of port there).

Thanks in advance.

I just passed up my left front tire
And it's gettin' hard to steer!
Down to the El Camino,
Right past the Sunnyvale cop.
I had to drag my Reeboks
To get the car to stop.

Make sure the transmission oil level is topped off, this noise can
affect an otherwise good gearbox with low oil level. Otherwise you
mainshaft bearing is probably bad as you suspect. Very hard driving
especially over rough roads under heavy load will eventually cause
the gears to self-destruct as the tolerance of the mainshaft to
pinion shaft increases.

Subject: Valentine 1 -- confirmed sighting

15 DEC

Yes, I have had one for the last 2 months or so.

I ordered it sight-unseen as soon as I saw the 1st ad in C&D. (I knew of his
reputation and have a G-analyst, so I expected the Valentine 1 would be very
good.)

It didn't come for about 5 months  -- immediately the orders got all
backlogged.  (When they told me there was a 3 month wait, I asked if it was
vaporware and was assurred that it wasn't -- simply that they were receiving
many, many orders more than could be filled.)

After the 3 months dragged on to 4, I even called them and spoke to Valentine
himself about the delay. He told me that QA on these microparts is VERY hard.

Finally it arrived.

It definitely works.  There are 2 antennas builtin (forward and behind) so it
finds the badguys whereever they are.  Of course, I can't attest to the
X/K/Xa, etc stuff which C&D tested, but I assume that everything functions
properly. The arrows are neat: they light forward, backwards, or sideways to
indicate where the badguy is. The device is appreciably larger than my old
Passport, so it is more intrusive.

Complaints: none.

Comments: 

a)	It has 3 modes of operation (increasing intelligence of radar
	filtering out).  It doesn't allow you to change the default mode, and
	since the best one is the 3rd choice, you have to reset it each time
	you bootup.

b)	If you want to permanantly wire it in the dash (as opposed to the
	cigarette lighter) the supplied wire - which uses RJ11-style phone
	connectors -- is kind of thick.  I'm still using it with the cigarette
	lighter wire.

Mainly, I like it a lot. Feel free to telphone me to discuss further, anyone.

Subject: Re: Radar again


Jim,

Mixing a signal and sending it back out is definitely not a passive
activity. This might cause some confusion later in court !

But the technique is interessting. Radar works on the doppler shift
principle (i.e. a difference in speed translates to a shift in
frequency which the radar detector detects). 

If the unit mixes the incoming signal carrier with white noise, they
are effectively spreading the incoming signal power over the white
noise spectrum (same sort of principle is used in spread spectrum
communications). If there is enough white noise generated, then the
police radar detector will not be able to distinguish its carrier signal
from the white noise (depending on how good the police radar detector
receiver sensitivity is).
 
I don't know if it would read a lower speed on the radar unit, but it
will probably not be able to distinguish the incoming received signal
from noise and thus might stay blank. The 50-80% of the time may or may 
not be correct, I can't tell.

Subject: Funny Clutch Behavior

My 1988 944 has always had a funny problem with
the clutch system.

This problem only occurs in the winter. Its
symptom is that the spot in the pedal travel
in which the clutch begins to engage changes
dramatically. Normally, it is near the top of
the pedal travel. Sometimes when it is cold,
it will be about 1/2 way up and it seems that
the effort required to push in the clutch also
becomes lower. After driving it a while(10-20 min.)
all seems to return to normal.

While the car was under warranty, the clutch
slave cylinder was replaced when the pedal
was sticking. Nothing else has been done, since
it happens so infrequently.

Does this sound like a clutch master cylinder
problem? I want to be sure before I replace it,
because it does not appear to be a pleasant
undertaking.

Any help would be appreciated.

Peter, this is the first I've heard of such behavior in a 944 ('82+ all 
had hydraulic clutch activation).

Bleed the line to be sure your problem isn't just small bubbles that 
escape somehow.  Might be a bad slave seal that lets air in when the 
car sits for long periods in the cold.  Winter temps. and moisture ruin 
slaves every once in awhile - it's not all that rare.  (Warning: 
bleeding a 944 clutch is *very* tricky - air enters very easily and 
virtually cannot be exorcised with conventional techniques!)

Replacing the clutch master cylinder isn't easy, but it's easy than 
replacing the brake booster, which I've done.

Maybe give Jerry a call at EPE and see what he thinks about your problem.

Perhaps this is obvious, but what about using the control arms & 
trailing arms?  The car will still wiggle on its suspension, but it'll 
be safe.  Use a fabric-type tie strap.

Leave the transmission in neutral during towing - the rocking motion 
can damage the gearbox, I've been told.

A reel type  cargo strap over each rear wheel (WRT the trailer)... 
Usually you can have the front end of 
the strap fixed, lay the strap and reel to the outside and roll over it, loop it
over the wheel and cinch it. This takes care of both forward and back movement.
Make sure when trailering to leave brake off and gearbox in neutral.
The only draw back is that the car suspension will be working but with enclosed
trailers, unless you have easy access to the forward end, you can't avoid it.
Ideally you would like to  have the car tied down firmly enough at both ends to
limit suspension travel so those megabuck konis don't get prematurely worn.
A softly sprung trailer will help, though.

I agree about the possibility of using the control/trailing arms.  However,
I personally recommend using chains over fabric tie straps.  Seen them
break too many times.  You can use chains and with a little ingenuity and
some padding keep them from making even the slightest scratch on your
suspension or anything.

This is well within spec, even for a new car.  Before doing anything
drastic, a leak-down test would, at a minimum, be in order.

Hi there,

I understand that Techron is recommended by porsche and not many bad

Subject: chip for 944?


Hi,

I recently bought an '87 944 and somebody was telling me that Dinan makes a 
chip for it that is supposed to really improve the performance.

I have three questions:

1) Is this thing legal in CA?

2) What should I expect to pay for the upgrade?

3) Does the cost justify the results?

Thanks in advance.  Merry Christmas!

It depends on what gas you normally run.  Good quality detergent gas 
keeps the injectors clean by itself.  I recently tore down a 951 head 
at 67K miles and only a couple tins of Techron, but which runs on Mobil 
93 Octane + detergent.  The valves were perfectly clean!

Lower grade / non-detergent gasolines allow deposit build-up, which 
eventually affects the injector's spray pattern and causes problems.  
In that case, I'd suggest (but without any supporting facts) that 
monthly would be sufficient.

Yes, Techron does seem to be a safe and effective additive.

No, I don't think so.  You'll go faster by investing the several hundreds of

Subject: Re: Techron

Techron is generally endorsed by car manufacturers, including the Germans,
as good stuff.  I don't know what the minimum "recommended" usage is, but
I do know that one should not use it too many times per oil change, I
believe because it does mildly invade (dilute?) the oil.

My mechanic (Bosch CSC) recommends using a smaller amount on each refill,
rather than a big bottle every so often.  BMW sells the stuff in these
smaller bottles, and last time I bought a case, their price was quite
competitive with the aftermarket.

I don't really know which cars need it more than others.  I suspect that,
while as Jim suggests detergent gasolines are a big help, there are some
cars which nonetheless have persistent coking problems.  I seem to recall
that 3-series BMW's have this problem big time.  A dealer mechanic told
me some time ago that 16-valve 944's are basically free of coking problems.
This is not the case with eight-valvers.  (Jim: Steve R had a major walnut
job when he bought his '84 944.)

Having had the dubious honour of cleaning a few sets of 911 valves in
recent history, and knowing that their motors were well fed, I can certainly
say that 911's are not immune to coking and would benefit from Techron!
Best bet is to find out from friends/mechanics whether your model and year
has a history of valve coking.

The 71 911 should be a fairly reliable car. The only years to avoid
for the 911s are 75-77 with the 2.7 L engine. I would check that there
is no hidden rust and the engine is in good condition. Also, you
should check if the timing chain tensioner and the clutch have
been updated to Carrera spec. If not, you should budget about 
$1000 for these two upgrades. Good Luck!

This is probably more true for the injectors than for valves. Even
if you use good quality petrol and take frequent short trips with
your car, your are prone to have dirty valves. This is so because
you are running rich most of the time at lower revs. German cars
periodically require flogging on the highway to remain clean.
Not necessarily high speed but high revs. When I use techron, I
drive more aggressively to maximise the benefits.

Yes, everybody seems to have this problem with 944's. You are 
NOT the only one, so rest assured. This is a common topic of
conversation here and is apparently caused by a faultly rear

Do you mean just the 2.7L engine or some other things as well?

Subject: Re:911 Tips requested

Actually, just the 2.7 engine. It's pretty much at the limits of the
case structure, and tends to wear in expensive ways. If you should
luck upon a '74-'77 3.0 Carrera, disregard the above and buy it anyway.
They're great cars, and worth the extra investment you *will* eventually
have to make in the engine.

Interestingly enough, around Houston I've been seeing 911SCs for under
$13K, even down to $10K in one case. Wierd, but true.

And, save yourself some grief and agony: if you're looking at an older
car (or for that matter, a newer car) find someone who's knowledgable
to go with you when you look at it. Hmmm, you say. Where do I find such
a person? The right answer is in your local Porsche Club.

Let's see: you're in Bellvue, so you might try contacting
Sherri Seybold in Bothell at (206) 488-1060. She's the contact for
the PCA Pacific Northwest region (which is basicly just a corner of
Washington state).

Subject: Fuel for 79 UK SC


I have a 79, UK spec 911SC (with the exhause air injection pump). 
The manual talks about 92 octane, low lead  fuel (I think, previously known 
as two star petrol). This kind of fuel is no longer sold in the UK. My choices
are 4 star leaded (95 octane - I think), Unleaded (91 octane - I think) or
Super Unleaded (95 - I think). 

Just now, I am alternating between 4 star and Unleaded but I am worried that
the 4 star is too rich and coking up the engine, while I am also worried that
the unleaded is damaging the valves. What are other people using ? Which gives
best performance ? Which is best for the engine ? Any ideas ?

On an unrelated note - Is it safe to water jet wash the engine ? Do I get the
engine really hot or just warm ?

Thanks for any help.

As Kevin mentioned, you shouldn't use Techron too many times between oil

times between oil changes. It doesn't say what happens with the sixth

Bruce Anderson covered this in his column in the Aug '92 issue of
Excellence.  Bottom line:

 1. Since 77/78, Porsche has designed cars to run on unleaded.

 2. Valve seat recession is really a function of valve seat hardness.
He tested a bunch of heads, including: '66 911, '69 911, '76 911, 1.8 914,
1.7 914, '62 356, and a 356C/912.  He found all of them to have seats
with Rockwell hardnesses adequate to unleaded gas.

For more details, pick up the issue.  I think you're OK.  Keep an ear out
for detonation ("pinging").
