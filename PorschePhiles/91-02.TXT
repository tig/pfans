	I've been following the recent discussion about the cost advantages
of bring your Porsche to an Independant dealer for servicing rather
than a Porsche main dealer.

	I haven't been able to afford a Porsche yet (I hope (fingers
crossed :-) ) to get an 85/86 944 next July/August) but anyone I
speak to, and any magazine articles I have read on the subject all
say not to touch a Porsche unless it has a full Main Dealer service
history.

	I wonder how much the resale value of the car drops relative to the
amount saved by getting a (cheaper) independant dealer to work on
the car.

Philip

P.S. I realize that this is not a consideration for anyone who is
going to run their car into the ground and is not worried about
resale value!

RESALE???

All right, all right...  Well, you pose an interesting dilemna because
the good thing about a dealer is that he can be held accountable for
his work and the records are like a academic transcript.  So a used
Porsche would be better to buy with good service records.  If you're
not worried about resale value (I mean sheesh, if you want an investment,
how about CDs?), you can go to a specialist. But, I suppose if you'd
rather go to a dealer/seller post-warranty rather than somebody *more*
interested in maintenance and performance, than that's the price you
pay for something which unless, you're building a showroom too, will lose
money regardless of how you take care of it.  Besides, just because
you're an intelligent buyer doesn't mean that the person you're selling
it to is...  Of course, every Porsche is sacred, but must we make sure
our babies are placed in good homes? Now there's the real ethical
question...  It's not whether you can  maintain it's high price, but
whether it has the right pedigree.

I guess it's up to you because if you're planning on having museum
pieces in fifty years, you'd better go to the dealer.  If on the
other hand, you'd rather drive the Porsche thus making everybody
elses museum pieces become more unique, you too are contributing
to the general welfare of the Porsche.  


I personally want a Porsche that runs right firstly, and one that looks
right secondly.  Thus I take it to he who knows how to make it go.  Seems
like the general consensus on the net is that it's not the dealer.
I tend to agree, but not for the reason of price but for the reason
of experience.

And now for my dance routine...  (is there a way to make a smiley with 

his eyes looking up at the sky like "oy vay"?) =-P

I would like to find any 18 year old car that has full service records from
the dealer...your ideas about dealer service may apply to 944's and 928's,
but cars such as the 914 or older 911's don't have all of that DME voodoo
stuff to worry about, and can be serviced with as much or better reliability
from a _qualified_ independent mechanic.

Judging from the dealership in Austin, I wouldn't put money on anything that

Just a couple of comments here:

The local dealer (palo alto, ca) has a guy in the parts dept, that seem to 
know his inventory pretty well.  Most of the stuff I've asked about, he does
not need to look up.

Also, when I was younger and riding motorcycles, I went into the local Yamaha
shop for some engine parts.  The parts manager there just started writting 
down the part numbers (w/o looking them up!) for the stuff I needed.  These 
numbers were 12 or 15 digits.

This can be contrasted with some parts departments I've been in where the 
guy at the counter, after I point to the part on the fiche, looks up the
number, brings me the part, and won't believe me when I tell him THAT IT IS
THE WRONG PART!

What I am getting at, is that I think a lot depends on the guys running 
the place.  I suspect that at the local dealer here, at least one person 
would have known that all 911 valve springs are the same.

I don't agree with this at all.  The value of ANY car is higher if maintenance
records have been kept, particularly if they indicate proper maintenance ;-).
I do not feel that maintenance from the dealer is necessary.  For example, 
Garretson's in mountain view is not a dealer.  The service manager there is 
Clark Anderson (yup, Bruce's brother).  Given the choice of going there or
to the dealer, where would you go?

I do my own work.  I keep records of everything I do to the car, including
mistakes.  I do not ever plan on selling her (1980 911sc!!).  However, if
I ever do, I will expect pretty near top dollar.  Not only do I keep all
receipts, I keep a log book where everything is recorded as it happens.

>	I wonder how much the resale value of the car drops relative to the

If the value drops, it is because of substandard work.  This can happen 
anywhere.  I think the critical thing here is to be sure that the mechanic
working on the car IS EXPERIENCED WITH PORSCHES.  There are just too many
ways to screw up, and the screw-ups are too expensive.

One of the reasons I could afford my car, was that she did not come with
service records.  She did, however, come through the evaluation with no
serious bad marks.  Would I have paid more for a good paper trail?  Definitly!

Hi -

I don't write much - but mostly listen with interest - on the Porschephiles
list, but have something interesting to contribute today.

I've a '69 912 with split-shaft Solexes, and one of those little rubber/
plastic blocks (the backing to the split shaft adjustment screw) fell out
the other day.  I made a temporary fix (to keep the shafts rigid) and
yesterday got down to the Porsche dealer to get a new one.

This is part #692.100.933.01, and they wanted $45 for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Even
the guy at the dealer was pissed off and double-checked the price.  Needless
to say, I didn't buy the part (I was going to buy *two*).

FYI:

Garretson's has a new owner and service manager (the new owner is a porschephile but not directly involved in the shop).  Neither Bruce nor Clark are involved anymore.  I know the new owner and he plans to keep up the quality work.  They have maintained my Porsche's for 10 years now and I recommend them highly although I haven't been there under the new owner as much.  I live 70 miles away and they are not as convienient as they once were.

Subject: Re: Main dealer v Independants

I've had mixed success in dealing with both  dealers and independents for
service. I do have a couple of observations, though. 

	* I have only been able to get exceptional service at facilities 
	  where I have been able to develop close relationships with either 
	  the owner, the service manager, or one of the top mechanics. 
	
	* I have *never* had exceptional service at any facility where any 
	  one person wore more than two of the three hats mentioned.

I just got the 911 back from some service at a  local dealer. They sent me
a letter thanking me for my patronage at their parts department over the
past year, and a coupon good for 25% off on service at their service department.
As I needed a 4-wheel alignment, I decided to give them a shot. 

Well, their work was good, and they noticed that my left front bearings
needed to be adjusted. They called and waited for my approval, which I 
thought was pretty unnecessary for a $30 item which was clearly needed, but
I was glad they did check first. And, when I picked it up, I discovered that
they had gone ahead and re-packed and adjusted both front wheels, but had
decided to only charge me for the one I had authorized. I had to *make*  them
charge me for both of them. Their service ticket also had some interesting
info on it that I didn't know -- like the original delivery date for my car
-- significant as it was in Germany some 10 years ago. They also had some 
original configuration info that I was missing. I don't know if all dealers
behave this way, but I'm pretty happy with these guys.

Now, I'm not going to stop using my normal mechanic. Juan-Jose is just too
good to pass up, particularly as his shop is only 10 minutes walking distance
from my house. But if I ever need a second opinion, or something done that 
seems a bit  beyond J-J, it's back to Gullo-Haas Porsche-Audi. And if I 
ever decide to break down and buy a new model, I'm more likely to do business
with them than the other guys in town. I'd guess that this is something they're
counting on.

December 14: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington,
D.C., issued a report concluding that enough evidence exists of a
possible linke between cancer and low level (60-megahertz)
electromagnetic fields from powerlines and household appliances to
warrant new research.  The study must be reviewed by higher-level EPA
boards before the conclusions become policy.

--IEEE Spectrum, Feb 1991.

The above appliances most specifically apply to the monitors of
personal computers and workstations evident in most workplaces.  Such
as the one you could be staring at now.  An article in MacWorld
recommends staying at least 24" away from the Macintosh Color
monitors.  Further the greatest risk appears to be for pregnant women
because the fetus is developing so quickly that any "non-natural"
influence (such as drugs, alcohol, and nicotine as we know, and
magnetic raidation) can cause major changes in the infant's growth.
People working on computer systems should be wary of all information
pertaining to this unregulated potential health hazard.

Always looking.  I missed a one-owner '67 about 6 mos ago that had
always been garaged, had European heaters, no rust, and a tired engine
for $1,000.  The first guy there had the cash, and this was at 7:30
a.m.

>Or, does anybody know if there's anything special about the car (if

Is it a Targa, does it have any accessories, what shape is it in,...

Based on what I've seen, Targa adds $2 to $3k.  The original
Blaupunkt 3-band radios are going for $300; the original Hella
fog lights are going for $600;  the core engine is worth $1500.

It also makes a lot of sense to buy a 912 (or several) at today's low 
prices and wait for them to appreciate.  About 5 years ago you could 
pick up nice 356 roadsters for under $10k.  Now they are $35k.

Subject: 1974 911SC



Greetings, Racing Fans!  (to quote the wee Scot :-)  Well, I must say
that the events of the weekend have warmed my heart and soul.  Porsche
has returned to the winner's circle in fine form at the Daytona Sunbank
24, and a friend of mine who has been a confirmed T-bird pilot for
years has become interested in 911's.  Wonders never cease.  ;-)

Seriously though, as a water-pumper owner (one of the two 928 owners on
the list, I think -- Hello, Don :-), I know a bit about what to look
for in 944's and 928's, but I'm a bit in the dark on 911's.  So, I
thought I would turn to the more knowledgeable 911 owners.  My friend
is interested in a 1974 911SC.  Are there any specifically good or bad
points to the SC from 1974?  Besides the usual things common to all
Porsches, what else should I look at to determine how good the car is?
Since the car is a California Bay Area car and has never seen snow,
there shouldn't be any rust problems.

What about frequency of repair?  I think I heard that the car has
100,000 miles on it, and that the engine has been completely rebuilt.

Basically, I want my friend to enjoy owning a Porsche as much as we do
and to that end, I'm trying not only to help him buy a good car, but
to know what to expect in upkeep costs as well.

Thanks for any and all help.

Keep it between the ditches!

Hmmm...  Well, I guess the Spectrum messed up.  Looks like they've
been typing it too much these days.  I typed it in verbatim.  :-O

Looking back at the MacWorld (July 1990), it certainly is 60 hertz.
The magnetic strength measured is considered dangerous at above
2 milliGauss.  Somebody should tell Spectrum.

A _74_ SC?  They didn't make SC's until 78...  Maybe your friend means a
74 Carrera, with the ducktail and flairs.  Or maybe just a S.  If it is just
an S, the engine would be 2.7L CIS injected.  Make sure the engine was
properly rebuilt with dilivar head studs and 84-on hydraulic chain tensioners.
Carberators would be a good upgrade also.  I'm not sure about the exhaust off
hand...the best setup is the old-style dual inlet exhaust with no cat
converter.

In terms of the body (if it is indeed a 74), they didn't start large scale
zinc coating until 76.  The big trouble spot in the car is the front suspension
tray (I speak from experience).  Tell your friend to buy Bruce Anderson's
_911 Performance Handbook_ - it tells what to look for in a used 911 in the
last chapter, as well as giving a good engine developmental history.

So much for my top-of-the-head remarks...find out exactly what model 911
your friend is looking for...

SCs happened in '78. Anything that's a '74 isn't an SC. If it looks like
an SC, someone  has had it altered. Bad sign.

My rule of thumb is never  ever buy a '74-77 911 that you aren't prepared
to immediately drop $10k into an engine rebuild for.  Unless you don't
plan to drive it, or you have found a real RS or RSR. Some of the '74
Carreras are OK too, as they are significant enough to justify suffering for
but it's a close thing...

If you think you have a significant car, call the VIN number in to your
local dealer or PCNA to have them "run" it for you. You can learn all sorts
of interesting stuff that way...

Buy, and memorize, Bruce Anderson's "The 911 Performance Handbook" before
buying any 911. Lots of info that you need to know about the things that
got corrected in any given year from the prior year, lots of "well, I'd
do it this way" in the performance rebuild section.

Sunday was indeed a good day!  Group C's loss is IMSA's gain.  For those of you
who didn't see ESPN's rather abbreviated (and content-free) coverage, a Joest
962C won the day, with other 962's in positions 3 and 5.  Does anyone know what
happened to John Paul Jr's 962 cabri, btw?

Favourite shots: 1) Arye Lyundyk (sp?) going through traffic like a knife
through butter, near the beginning.  2) That shot of a new transaxle being
wheeled out for one of the GTP cars, on its already-mounted wheels.  Gee, if I
could get service like that for my car!

Regarding the '74 911.  I know that conventional wisdom (meaning, in all
likelihood Bruce Andersons) has it that anything after '78 is a much better bet
than earlier.  Bruce has a chapter devoted to buying a used 911 in his 911
Performance Handbook.  He also wrote a like article for Excellence; I'll send
you a copy if you give me a USPS binding.

What does $10k buy when it comes to 911 engine rebuilds?  I mean, I have
no reason to doubt your figures, I would just like to know how the costs 
break down and what level of performance you get (as opposed to, say, a
$6k rebuild to stock factory specs).

>What does $10k  buy....

Well, for starters, I've never had to do an engine where I also didn't
really need to do a clutch and tranny. Add another $2k there. 

In the second place, these days I either have engines build by folks 
I really trust (like ANDIAL or Kraftwerk - actually more convenient
as they're just up the road about 50 miles), or folks I can kind of "supervise",
like my usual mechanic. This adds to the costs over doing it yourself,
natch. If I were going to do it myself, I'd  still shop out all of the 
machining so probably wouldn't save that much  anyway. And if the old
engine wasn't completely dead, I'd still run it and build a new engine
on a old core, which I'd also have to acquire.

Last is the reliabilty improvements. Heat and  friction are the great 
killers of young air-cooled engines. Going to later model 930 oil pumps
is generally a good idea. Having the case machined for improved oil/air
flow is always a good idea. Replacing *all* of the oil cooler  plumbing
(so where did you *think* those little metal shavings were hiding, anyway?)
is a must, and when you do that, you might as well add either the  Turbotrol
or factory European radiator  style cooler.  Plus all of the usual stuff
that Bruce mentions - Dilavar studs, new chains, Carrera  tensioners, oil
bypass mod, SSI heat exchangers, etc.

It all adds up. $10k isn't too far off the mark.  Which is kind of a  shame
for a $12k car.  

One final note. You *can* do it for a whole lot less, by just ordering
a rebuilt engine from someone like Kempton Brothers for $5-7k and not
doing anything else. But there is the reliability issue.  And the defered
cost issue. I've seen friends chose to neither replace nor clean the oil
cooler and it's plumbing, only to have new rebuilds  die  inside 5k miles
from contamination.  Your  choice.

Although nothing Stan said was incorrect, let me just say that the 911
engine is perhaps one of the most reliable engine ever made.  You
*can* rebuild a 911 engine for under 4K.  The problem is there is SO
MUCH you can do to add a little HP here,  a little reliability
there, and a little enhanced oil flow or cooling somehwere else...THings
you don't have to do, but while you've got the engine apart you figure
you might as well, and you end up making an engine that is going to
last AT LEAST 200K miles and suddenly you've spent 10k.

The thing about the 2.7 engine is that some can't be rebuilt.  It was
made with such small tolerances that the ones that have been
overheated badly have warped.  And once you split the case there is no
way to get it back together again.  Of course, this is supposed to
be a rare occurance.  I've never seen it, nor do I personally know
anyone who has, but Bruce Anderson does claim it's a problem.  I think
certainly the 2.7 is the least reliable of the 911 engines, but that
still makes it a 150K mile engine (with proper care).

Subject: 944 Clutch package special


We were just helping a friend put in a clutch for his 944 (what a
pain, BTW), and found out that our distributor is have a 944 clutch
special: $430 for a 944 (non-turbo) clutch package (thats the OEM
Fichtel&Sachs clutch disk, pressure plate, and throwout bearing).
This is a pretty good price.  If anyone wants one, let me know.

 Hi all!
 
 A friend of mine is considering buying a 928.  He used to have a ~74
 911 and has been driving an unimpressive 944 for the past several
 weeks. I think he's crazy (as is anyone who drives a non-911 :-), but
 anyway, he wants more interior space etc.  These are also really a good
 deal around here.  (Much cheaper than a comprable 911 for instance).
 Being utterly hung up on 911's I have kind of filtered info re: these
 out over the period that I have been Porsche bewitched.  I know a
 couple of you out there own them, and if anyone has any info, (ie; bad
 years, repair horrors, driving impressions, etc) I'd like to pass them
 along.
 
 On another note, my 80SC is set up ala Weissach special edition with
 the '76 turbo tail and front spoiler, recaros, etc., (all the pieces
 but alas not really a Weissach).  I have really gotten to like the
 looks of the car, but I'm kind of hung up on the fact that the tail is
 not a factory part.  I would like to replace it with a *real* '76
 turbo (or 80 Weissach) tail.  Anyone have any ideas?  This part is
 still available from the factory but is horrendously expensive.  These
 are hard to locate on the used market, but if anyone has some secret
 source or whatever I'd sure like to know.
 
 
 Thanks
 
 Bruce

I considered a 928 once, since they are SO cheap, but abandonded the
idea because of the maintenance costs.

Consider that there is a reason they are so cheap.  When buying a used
911, you are almost insured to get at least the money you spent back
if you sell it.  With the older cars, you often get much more.  With a
928, this isn't true.

I beg to differ with you, sir. THE absolute most reliable engine, IMHO and
other's HOs is the 4.5 liter v8 used in the late 70's and early 80's Mercedes
(ugh- no flames, please) 450 series; SL, SLC, SE, and SEL. There are a few
reasons for this:
   1) Large size putting out little power (160 horses I believe)
   2) Low revs (redline at 5.5k)
   3) Fantastic construction

  We have a 450 SL and SEL in our family; the cars cannot die. They've had well
over 200k miles between them (they're '77s), and a friend has about 150k miles
on an '80. Unkillable cars.

I didn't say it was THE most reliable engine.  I said it was one of

Not to belittle these engines, but "200K miles between them" is not that
uncommon. I personally know of VW, Porsche and Volvo engines that
have gone way over the 150K mark, and I hear similar anecdotes all the
time. This, of course, does not take anything away from the cars you
mention.

Another thing you might consider, depending on the age of your car, is buying
the engine from Porsche.  They have, several times in the last two years, had
unannounced, unadvertised fire sales on engines.  Like about $7,000 for a
new-in-the-crate 951 (non-S) engine.  They have also had some suprisingly old
NOS for sale as well.

Totally hit or miss.  Call up your nearest knowledgeable and friendly dealer
parts person and ask.  I think that PCNA periodically FAXes the dealers with
these clearance items, so you have to know who to ask.

Of course, this is nowhere near as fun as (re)building it yourself.  Nor do you
get all the tweaks than Stan mentioned.

As far as reciprocating engines go, the 450 and the Porsche 6 are great.
The Porsche, of course, being air-cooled, needs good airflow, but the
number of 9xx wins in endurance racing with these engines shows that
they not only last, but crank out the juice while lasting.

Also not to belittle them (I think the boxer design is the best piston
engine layout ever) I've had a rotary (my '85 Rx7) go 165,000 miles
without any signs of weakening. The Rx7 GTU win at Daytona this year is
yet another example of the advantages of no reciprocating mass and low
parts count. Naturally, the Porsche 962 win overall is yet another example
of Porsche's superiority in serious crank for long hauls.

You are right.  The 951's really kicked butt in escort a few yaers ago,
and on the non endurance side, they too the firehawk title in 90 , with
the S@ engine installed, and won SSGT 86 through 88, until they were
summarily kicked out with the Vettes for being too fast.

Thay did some pretty incredible things in lemans in 82 also, 6th
overall, I beleive, with a stock-block 944 engine and the help of the
turbo.

Yup, those 9xx cars sure do go.  Yeah, every model since the 356 and 550
should definately be lumped into the 9xx category.

     Chris you state that the 928 has higher maintenance costs.  What
          exactly do you mean?  Relative to a 911,914,924 what model.
          After thinking this one over you might be able to say that
          because of the huge after market of parts for the 911 that
          it has a lower cost for maintenance.  If so I would only
          think that is true for the # of models out there, 928
          production for the 1st 10yrs (78-88) near peaked at more
          than 2200 units (US models).  A little math can give you a
          ball-park figure as to how many of these (cheap) cars are
          around (not to mention totaled out models from accidents).

          I have fairly detailed maintenance logs on my 1980 928 and
          consider the costs reasonable for the amount of miles.

          Would any 911 owner with 75K miles or greater like to
          compare notes?  The 928 is a very tight reliable car with
          a design much more recent then that of a 911.  You 911
          owners kill me with sticking to the "old school".  911
          hysteria has just gone out of control, the only reason I
          can figure is the 930 which is normally out of Joe Avgs.
          price range. (28-35K) for a car that's had the piss run out
          of it.  To me that doesn't seem like a very good value.

          I could take up some time and give you many more reasons to
          go with a 928 then any other Porsche, but I'll wait and see
          how many 911 "freaks" respond to this posting.

Subject: Weight Balancing
Cc: s@brahms.udel.edu


Had a good time weight balancing my 951 last night.  This seems to have
made a real difference in handling.  The car started out like this:

Front

832                     827



857                     790




The next step looked like this, after raising the RR .375"


850          809




839          808

Which was close enough for me.  Although we only shifeted 18 lbs, the
car now sits pretty much level and has 50.2/49.8 FR distribution and
51/49 LR weight distribution.

For those who are unfamiliar with the purpose of weight balancing, it is
to get the F/R distribution even, sifde to side, and the L/R
distribution even, front to back, or as close as possible.

the L - F/R turned out to be 50.3/ 50.01 (pretty close in my book)

The F LR turned out to be 51.2 vs  51.0 (also prety damn close)

Lucky we got it on the first try.

OK, go ahead and explain why the value of the car
plummets in relation to 911s.  I'll compare maintenance costs with you
any time.  You seem quite smug that no 911 freaks would respond.  For
my 1970 911, I have all mantenace records since 1973.  I'll wager the
maintenace costs on that car since 1973 has been less than your
maintenance costs since 1980.

"911 hysteria" as you describe it, exists because the 911 is the
greatest Porsche ever made, it and the 356 are the classic Porsches.
THe founder of the company, Ferry Porsche, said in his autobiography
"The 911 is the model I like the most."  The 928 doesn't win races, it
has no endurance performace statistics, it's the Porsche luxury car.

Ouch, I feel compelled to respond.  I have both an '87 944S and an '86
928S.  The maintenance costs to date have been quite reasonable and the
only problems that I've experienced have been taken care of by Porsche.
(Fortunately, in '86 Porsche offered a five year warranty)  I see a
familiar phenomenon regarding diehard 911 type enthusiasts in Ferrari,
Lamborghini, and American Muscle car lovers.  Ferraris and many other
"exotic" Italian cars are basically art on wheels rather than
automobiles.  Thus the incredible prices commanded that make them
unreachable for most individuals.  The 911 line is basically a "style".
The flat six' design and performance limitations have been openly admitted 
by Porsche engineers.  The aerodynamics of the entire 911 series have been,
at best, questionable.  Of course, this doesn't take away anything from the
"Original Porsche Mystique".  My point precisely is that these
characteristics, negative or otherwise, make the venerable 911/930 what
they are.  928s and 944s are basically excellent all-around cars that I
drive daily.  Practicality is the key word here.  Which automobile is
"best" is ultimately dependent on the person who owns (and hopefully
drives) the car.  Design considerations aside, I chose the 928S then the
944S because of their excellent handling, relative gas mileage, power,
and styling (not necessarily in that order).  Perceived prestige is a
plus also.  Hmm, maybe that's why 911 series owners are prone to
frequent claims of superiority...    ;-)

 Case in point: My friend has an '86 911 turbo.  When she and I
participate in childish, irresponsible activity on the highway I notice
that I usually end up leading into turns or corners.  When asked, she
only admits to having recurring dreams of flying off a cliff backwards.
  1/2 :)

First of all, the 911 is an anomoly, in thet it actually appreciates, it
is definately a collector type car.  The water pumpers are not.  Period.
Aside from thet, though, as mentioned in a previous note, the 924 and
944 have had conciderable sucess racing.  Even track events should give
some indication of 944T performance.  Take a 951S, stock, and compare it
with a same year 911 (89), given drivers who have campeigned the cars
respectively.  Look at the lap times.  Pretty damn close.

I can't comaper carerra2/4 in the equasions as of yet, because I havn't
personally seen anyone who has pushed the car to it's full potential.
That should happen, in force, this season, and I would guess the carerra
2/4 perfomance to be close to that of the (out of production) 951S.  I
use the S as an example because of it's higher HP (247 vs 217).  Both
cars have similar HP and weight.

The S2, IMHO, is not a real contender, and really does not have the
power needed to make the car seriously fast.  Porsche has a way of
shuffling models so that some variant of the 911 will always be the
fastest production model.  Note that porsche's published stats for the
951s (89) are EXACTLY the same for the carrera4 of the same year,
162mph, 247 hp 0-60 in 5.7 seconds.  Also note that in 89, the 951 was
yanked along with the 930, and thet the 930 returned for US production
the same year the 951 was introduced.

Anyway, calling anything not air-cooled a luxo yaght would be a bit of a
mistake, especially if you are tracking a semi-stock 911Carerra.

If you look again, you'll see I said nothing about the 944.  The 911
does have a far more successful track record than the 944, but it's
been in use with less competition for longer.  And before all-wheel
performance cars came into being, the 911 was considered one of the
best off-road cars as well.

   Thus the incredible prices commanded that make them
   unreachable for most individuals.  

The 928 new is more unreachable than a 911.  It's only in the used
area that this is true.  And if we go back to my ORIGINAL point,
rather than flaming about "my car is better, nya nya", you have to
agree that buying a 911 is a low-risk venture, since you're almost
guranteed to get at least what you paid for it back if you try to sell
it, and OFTEN more.  This simply is not the case with the front engine
Porsches.  That and maintenance was the entirety of my original
message, that 928 and 944 owners took it personally is not my problem.

   The flat six' design and performance limitations have been openly admitted 
   by Porsche engineers.

What fantasy.  Show me the Porsche Engineer who said that.  RUF now
gets 500 HP out of the same design.

   Perceived prestige is a
   plus also.  Hmm, maybe that's why 911 series owners are prone to
   frequent claims of superiority...    ;-)

Put it this way.  Who would you say are the greatest Porsche drivers of
our time?  Al Holbert?  He drove a 911 and was trying to get a 959.
Derek Bell?  911.  Hans Stuck?  959.  Jacky Icxs (sp?) 911.  Jurgen
Barth?  911.  I don't know about M. Andretti, but in a talk I saw him
give he was extolling mid and rear engine layouts.  I don't know about
Teo Fabi, either, but neither would I call him a great Porsche driver.
These are the men who shaped the Porsche image through success on the
track.  Their knowledge and driving ability can not be questioned.
They have their choice of Porsches.  They choose 911s.  I think Hans
Stuck has a 928, also, but it is his wife's car.

    Case in point: My friend has an '86 911 turbo.  When she and I
   participate in childish, irresponsible activity on the highway I notice
   that I usually end up leading into turns or corners.  When asked, she
   only admits to having recurring dreams of flying off a cliff backwards.

That the 911 is difficult to drive is a fact.  Mastering it is an
accomplishment.  Mastering a 944 or 928 requires only knowing how to
turn the steering wheel.  Truly this is a mark of a more advanced
automobile, however, there is a level of driving skill (which I don't
claim to have attained yet) at which that is not desireable.  The
proof of this is that the drivers mentioned above choose 911s.  Keep
in mind that 944s and 928s do go off the track, too.

Lastly, the 911 is a joy to work on, from a mechanics perspective.
The 944 is often a pain, but not usually unreasonable.  The 928 is a
nightmare...a total nightmare.

Hmm.  But the vehicle had 50.2/49.8 FR and 51.1/48.9 LR weight 
distribution before you started.  Wave your hands all you want,
that CG ainna gwanna move as a result of changing ride height
nohow.

Or if you prefer to confine the exercise to the realm of the 
physically possible, only try to get the ratio of front/rear weight
the same on both sides: (unless you want to get into actually
moving the CG)

847.5   811.5
841.5   805.5

2.5 lbs isn't bad at all.

I had been quietly following this discussion for a while, expending
significant will power trying not to get involved.  Well, I'm giving in.

Chris, while I certainly have respect for your expertise and knowledge, I'm
losing respect for your attitude.  You're reminding me of a teenager in love
with his first girlfriend; everything seems perfect and you can justify
anything.

It's not clear to me if you're talking about the cars they buy for the
street or the cars they race when you say "They chose 911s".  If it's race
cars, then it's a bunch of malarky.  These are professional (read: hired)
drivers, and they drive the cars they are paid to drive.  Stuck spent a
number of years in Audis, too...  And the Audi engine is a water-cooled
slant five *in front* of the front wheels, driving all four wheels with a
50/50 torque split!  Hardly a 911!

Excuse me?  That the 911 is difficult to drive is a fact, yes.  Mastering it
is indeed an accomplishment, and for that reason it is a very rewarding car
to drive well.  That does *not* make it a more advanced automobile!  And
it's not a simple tradeoff, that more performance automatically makes a car
harder to drive, or vice-versa.  That the 911 is hard to drive is *not* a
compliment to the car!  (It is a compliment to the drivers, of course.)

Furthermore, as a race driver, I take offense at the suggestion that
"mastering a 944 or 928 requires only knowing how to turn the steering
wheel."  The 944 and 928 are in many ways easier to drive than the 911.  (I
should point out that I've never driven a 928, but I have a gut feel what it
would drive like.)  They are also, in some ways, more challenging.  Each car
has its behavioral quirks, and to get the most out of any car requires
experience and skill.

That is not entirely the impression I've gotten, but I won't argue with it
since I've never worked on one and have no hands-on basis.

I totally and absolutely disagree with the statement that the 928 is a 
total nightmare to work on.  I feel that just isn't true.  I do think, though,
that when you say a car is hard to work on, you have to be a bit more 
specific (unless you feel the *whole* car is that way) and specify what is 
hard to work on (engine, chasis, suspension, etc).  And this is the last I'll
say on this car-wars thing :-)

Subject: Weight Balancing

} How did you do the weight balancing?  Do I need one of the fancy computer-controlled gadgets I see in the mags?  Can I use my 'bathroom' scale (assumming of course it read high enough).
} 
I have access to the real thing.  Rebel scales, which boil down to load
cells and some aluminum plates, which feed into a central computer.

} I have a basic question I haven't thought thru myself not got an answer from people I ask.  I am a rowing enthusiast as well and weigh the front and back of the boat seperately (the end opposite the scale sitting on the ground).  I get 2 weights which seems equivalent to what you are doing with the Porsche.  My question is:  added together, is this the total weight of my boat? 4x800 is about the weight of a 911, right?
}
Well, that was a 944T, full of gas (22 gal) with 250lbs of driver.  All
scales were reading simultaneously.
 
} About your numbers: do you want the RR loaded slightly less to account for acceleration (engine torque) loading transferring to the suspension and wheel?
}
Actually it transfers to the whole rear, and since you can't thange the
total F/R or R/L weight distribution, the bast you can do is hope for
the same split side to side or front to back on individual tires.
Really all you can do is increase load on diagonal tire sets.
 
P.S.  The guys who have the machines do this stuff as part of their shop
work and pretty much charge ion the same basis as they do for an
alignment.

Anyone interested can contact me, or see them at a PCA tracke event.

944's were produced in the last few years, I.e.:

'88 944/944 S/944 Turbo/944 Turbo S
'89 944/944 S/944 Turbo
'90 944 S2/944 S2 Cabrio

It seems that you guys are talking about things that are way over the head
of your average driver, however, I still have $.02 and I'll spend them any
way I want... :)

>Excuse me?  That the 911 is difficult to drive is a fact, yes.  Mastering it

I've only driven one 911, and I must admit, that it is indeed difficult. The
version I drove (an '86 non-turbo, not sure of the exact designation) had no
power anything. Steering while stopped or barely moving was a real pain; you
had to use your whole strength, almost. The pedals works backwards too; to 
explain what I mean, in my 944 when you hit the clutch, it goes down. It felt
to me the 911 clutch goes up, towards the top of the footwell. The same with
the brake; perhaps because the linkages are on the floor.

But anyway, to further describe the experience... Under full acceleration, the
car felt to me as if it was uncertain on it's feet, almost as if the car's front
wanted to lift. Or perhaps it was just the fact that the steering was not power
assisted (as in my 944). But anyway, I will agree with you, I'm sure the car
would be much less fun to drive day-to-day.

>to drive well.  That does *not* make it a more advanced automobile!  And

Actually, I'd say just the opposite. It makes it a much less advanced car;
after all, the object of advancing the state of the technology in passenger
(i.e. for day-to-day street use) cars is to make it as untedious as possible.

(Of course, this does not take into the account of the thrill of walking up
to a 951S, and the utter revulsion of doing the same to a 911--- No flames
please; but I don't like the styling)

Yup; I concur... What ways (in general) is the 944 harder than the 911?

>  (I

>would drive like.) 

Actually, the 928 is a fun car, if you want something. The one I drove was a
friends '84 (?) 928; one with the tiny rim of a spoiler... Anyway, it was 
an automatic, but while the car was large, heavy, wide, and much bigger
in all respects than the 944, it was a fun drive. It felt to me the same
as a '89 944 (regular automatic) in terms of performance, but it also felt
a bit more solid... I bet that at 160, a 928 is much more steady than a 944.

Subject: practical 924(long)




  Hate to break in during the air/water wars but I need some Porsche advice
  about Ferdinands (sp?) adopted child the 924 (Does anyone on this list own 
  one let alone actually like them?)

       Seeing how spring time is around the corner, I'm getting that itchin' 
       for a Porsche again.  The only problem is that I'm a starving college
       student. So here are some things I'd like to get some porschephile 
       advice on.

       - I've pretty much narrowed it down to an early 924 (77-82) and more
         likely an 80 or newer.  I'd consider a 914 but here in Michigan where
         they salt for 1/4" of snow it's hard to find one that isn't bending
         in half from underbody corrosion.  So I figured the galvanized 924
         body would be a big plus. Besides I like the looks better, but not 
         better than a 911 or a 944 or 928.....

       - If you couldn't tell from the above the car will be an everyday 
         driver, so any advice on things to watch out for would be appreciated 

       - How much difference does the oxygen sensor CIS inj make over pre 80's

       - I know later 924's were offered with 4 wheel discs (same as 944) but
         how likely am I to find one with'em and are they worth having (assume y

       - I'd think about getting a 924 turbo (931) but am a bit concerned about
         maintenance cost and reliability. Also, it seems that the U.S. 931's
         weren't much faster, but the euro versions were a definite step up,
         could someone please comment on the differences btw  the  80 and 81
         CR and boost pressure

                    CR       Max Boost    
      1980(euro)   7.5?       .7 bar?
      1980 (U.S)   7.5        .5 bar?
      1981 (euro)  8.5?       .6 bar?   boost gauge added? plus comp ignition
      1981 (U.S)   8.0        .5 bar?    "

       - Basically is the 931 worth the added cost and maintenance headaches
         and it seems by increasing boost to euro levels you can attain 
         similiar performance.

       - Getting back to the base 924 are there any ways to get a decent power
         gain without engine work (I know its slow)i.e. cams(I think automotion,         logi-cam and (gasp) even Andial all make cams for this Audi engine, 
         how good are they, any exp or sugg.((
       
      -  Now handling, what is the biggest tire I can fit under the wheel
         wells on stock rims (195 70R 14 or 205 60R14?)




       Thanks,
           

       Paul

Subject: Chicagoland query

This may be a moot question, but I'm looking for "good"
service/parts establishments in the chicgo-land area.
Any ideas?

Also, ased on the preceding discussions, it appears that
I would do better searching for a solid used  (under $10k)
911 with private parties rather than dealerships.  Although
I don't have direct experience with Porsche dealerships,
my experiences with other dealerships in the area have been
less-than-positive. With the exception of a local Acura dealer,
service, advice, quality-care, price considerations have been
MUCH less that satisfactory.  I dunno if I wanna get burned
with an older Porsche.

Comments/suggestions appreciated.

You're not going to believe who's saying this, but for the cost of
buying a decont 924 and then making the upgrades you mention, you
could buy a 944 and be much happier.

I wholheartedly agree.  An 94 944 has better equipment than a 924T,
similar performance (about 150 hp), a better trans, same brakes, fender
flares, better wheels (fuchs fit and may even be on it), more available
parts, much more reliable (no turbo to blow, and the 924 turbos are
notorious).  I have seen decent 84s as low as $5800 and 85.5s in the $7k
range (much better still, climate control, aluminum suspension peices,
etc. etc., more hp).

If you can aford 6K get a 944, if you are looking for an inexpensive car
(2K) you may be able to swing a 924, or if you can get a NICE 924 turbo
in the $3500 range (one went here for that and I would have bought it,
it was really mint) those are your options.  

Inequities in the market happen, and can be played to your advantage,
but a 944 is the best deal on the market right now.  Especially if you
can find one with a leather interior, say an 85.5.

So, a 944 is at rock bottom prices right now?

Would anybody like to elucidate on whether there is a turnaround
point in the value of the car similar to the 356 story?  Or is the
944, going to hit a baseline and stay there?

Hello Eveyone

In the first place... Excuuuuse me.  As the one who started this mini
flame fest in a completely inadvertent manner let me just say... oops!
If you will note, my original swipe at 928's and 944's was followed by
a genuine smiley  ---> :-) .  I don't think there's much question which
cars Porsche intends to be absolute world class competitors, which it
intends to be competition for 300ZX's, RX-7's, MR-2's and the like and
which are pretty obvious 450SL competition.  I think the Porsche entry
is hands down the winner in each category (of course).  These are all
excellent autos in their own way (I've never driven a 928) but the
choice is an individual thing, the cars are very different in character,
and comparisions are difficult.  Let's try to keep a friendly tone.

So, by the way, has anyone found me a whale tail?  I forgot to add that
more important than looks, I am really hooked on the incredible road feel at
higher speeds.  I wish I had more 911 experience so that I could really
judge it, but the stability of my car at 80+ (which is becoming a
surprisingly common speed regime on open freeways around here and not just
for 911's) is just fantastic.  I have never read anywhere how much
down-force is acutally exerted by a proper dam/spoiler set-up, would
anyone care to comment?  Are we really talking down-force, or absence
of lift?

Reply-To: seibert@xn.ll.mit.edu

This is not a flame, it is a differing opinion....

Having owned 2 924's over the last 10 years, I'll disagree with Steve and
Chris about the '84 or '85 944 over the 924 for the following reasons...924's

 1)  are less expensive to buy than 944's.
 2)  are less expensive to maintain (MUCH cheaper parts) than 944's.
 3)  are less expensive to insure than 944's.
 4)  don't have the bulging fenders (an inelegant design afterthought).
 5)  are perfectly capable around town.
 6)  can have wonderful handling (with a few inexpensive susp mods). 
 7)  are at the bottom of their depreciation, unlike 944's.
 8)  on average, haven't been tracked as much as 944's.
 9)  have the same weight distribution, rust-resistance, and practicality.

Besides, only Porsche-people know 924's aren't 4g race-cars and even most of
them have never actually driven one, and so don't know how good (not-bad?)
they really are.  They're also very easy to buy and sell because most Porsche
people sellers think they're not status symbols, and non-Porsche people buyers
think they are.  I am not saying it is a better Porsche, I am saying it may
fit his needs better as it does mine, for now.  _MS

Raising the Right Rear corner of the car three-eights of an inch.  This
is done by turning the height adjustment eccentric on the RR trailing
arm by the proper amount.  The proper amount cannot be given as an angle
exactly, but if the adj is at center, it amounts to a 22 degree
clockwise rotation, since 90 degrees gives an increment of damn near one
inch.

+ 1 inch          |

Middle    ----


- 1 inch          |

(imagien a hexagonal bolt in the center)

The bolt has an offset circle which moves the inner trailing arem plate
W.R.T the outer plate in this casse rotating it 1.43 degrees, The lever
arm to the wheel is 16", hence the wheel is lowered (the body raised) by
.375 inches.

Get it?  Hard to explain, but if it's really confusing I may be talked
into Postaling you a diagram.

	I would not expect a 944 to have a turnaround as did the 356.
The 356 had the following qualities which made it desirable:

	* heritage (original vs. later model)
	* air cooled (a religous issue, related to the prev. point)
	* limited production (vs. mass market) 

Although I love 944(s), I can't expect a turnaround based on
increased perceived value as a *collector's* car as we see now in
the 356.  True, the 944 is a benchmark, but there are too many 
sports cars that will dilute the 944s future value.

	Still, this is a good time to buy a 944 for *present*

In the Porsche Market Letter, a national listing of all Porsches, I
frequently see 944s for as little as $3-5K.  You may have to wait for
one of these deals, and you may need to do some fixing, but they're
probably worth it.

      I've heard that PCNA has "fact books" for various models and years, that
      gives things like the various obtions available and other specifications.
      Does anyone know how detailed they are or how far back they go (79-82?)
      How can I get a look at one of these (member of Porsche club? How do I 
      join anyway? Is ownership a pre-rec? what about IMPENDING ownership?))

      thanks

I think I get it... But why would you want to do this? Isn't
it advantageous to have the rear suspension height the same
for the left and right? Unless for some reason you want the
gas to be tilted, or you only plan to be making right 
turns or something...

Yes, PCNA does have these little gems, and they are great references.  Perfect
for those SCCA protests.  Order them from your dealer.  Last time I checked,
they cost like six to eight bucks per.  I think they started coming out in the
mid '80s, to replace the Tech Spec booklet series.  You can also get 'em from
the aftermarket, like Stoddard or Performance Products.
 
No, you need not be a PCA member to get anything from PCNA!  But you should join
PCA just as soon as you have a car.  And your local PCA region may be a good
resource to turn to for help in finding a car.  Check out the current issue of
their newsletter for its classifieds.

Gee, after reading Denise McLuggage's (apologies for sp) article in AutoWeek
last week, I am loath to speculate on the future value of ANY car.  She sold a
Ferrari 250 back in the early sixties for six grand.  Car's worth about 2 mill
today.  John Paterak had some similar story last year about a car gathering dust
in his garage - a four-cam, a 550, or a 904?  I forget.

I hate model-snobbery.  There are as many things about a 356 that make it "the
only real Porsche" (eg, designed by Ferry) as there are which make it "not a
Porsche" (eg, VW mechanicals).  Ditto for all other models.  Those sorts of
foibles play take a very small role in determining a car's future value, in my
limited experience.

While not a sure-fire guarantee, rarity is always a good predictor of future
value.  For example, look at recent prices for the 914/6, 912, and 912E series. 
Not too shabby for cars some would call "ugly ducklings" and "orphans."  Based
on that, here are a few ideas about what I think might appreciate quickly in the
next few years.

Number one HAS to be the 931 - better known as the 924 Turbo.  When was the last
time you saw one in primo condition, aside from a Parade?  Touche.

In the 944 series, look at the numbers for last year (MY90).  I forget the exact
ones, but there were in the hundreds of 944S2 coupes produced for domestic
consumption.  And there were only two thousand odd 944S2 cabri's.  Better still,
how many 2.7 litre 944's do you know?  I have never even seen one!

And let's not forget the "signature edition" cars produced a few years ago, I
think in celebration of the 911's 25 anniversary auf der Bahn.  I forget the
colours used in the different models, but I remember the 911's diamond blue
exterior and crushed leather interior, with Dr. Porsche's signature embroidered
into the headrest.  And I remember that the dealer's couldn't give them away (so
to speak).

You are missing the point entirely.  Let's say you crank the RR all the
way down (i.e. move suspension into the fender, thus lowering the rear
right corner of the car.  Simultaneowly you do excatly the same thing to
the LF corner by changing spring perch height.  Now raise the RF and LR
corners by exactly the same amount.  

What will happen?  The car will have the following weight distribution

LF        RF
200       1400



1400       200
LR         RR
But will still be LEVEL since the frame is, for all intents and
purposes, rigid.  

Now go into a sharp right hand turn. SPecs are assumed as follows:

Center of gravity - center of car, 20" off the road
wheelbase - 93"
Track     - 60"

Pull 1 g around a corner, sum moments about the left tires:

You will shift 1067 lbs of weight from left to right and the wight
distibution will be as follows

1067       533


1600       0

Which means the LR tire will be completely off the ground.  Oversteer
from hell because you will be overloading the LR tire

Now, just for fun, let's take a left turn at 1g, and we get the
following weight distribution:

0       1600


1067     533

(Lucky the 951 has perfect 50/50 distribution)
Now what happens?  Understeer from hell, as the LF tire completely
leaves the ground.

Is'nt that fun, understeer on left turns and oversteer on right turns.
Thinggs get real interesting if one of the 1600 lb tires hits a bump mid
corner, like you are picking guardrail out of your teeth!

Now let's take a properly balanced car:

800 800

800 800  (rear)

Right turn:                                    Left Turn

1333   267                                     267  1333

1333   267                                     267  1333

Neutral handling.

Now for braking:
Lets say .8g (easily possible)
Bad setup:

467       1600


1333       0

Not exactly best use of rubber!, as opposed to proper WB car

1025    1025

675      675

Get it?  The idea is to balance weights as evenly as possible between
tires under all conditions, since friction output of a tire is not truly
linear with weight applied.  it drops off.  for example


Weight       Max friction

200           220
400           410
600           605
800           802

1000          1000

1200          1180
1400          1300
1600          1450
1800          Kaboom!

These are relatively close.  We just had a real race car engineer speak
at our meeting, this was for the aveage tire, the tend is pretty
consistant, in that there is a weight at which tirs pull 1G, above less,
below more.

When someone started commenting on differences between the
major street Porsches (911, 928, 944 in numerical order),
half the people entheustically supported and argued their
views, while a few came out and said, "I don't want to hear
this air vs water cooled debate AGAIN."

Well, for me, this debate is never occured, and I heard
no significant mention anywhere in the arguments of the
relative merits of various cooling systems: go with what
works! My reasons for prefering my car (951S) were asthetic
(I dislike the looks of the others) and drivability (I believe
the car is more fun to drive than the others). If it had an
inline six cooled with glycerine or a rotary fivc air cooled,
I could care less; the car would still look the same and except
for power differences, handle the same.

So, please explain to me, you people who are so insecure to believe
that any attack on the car that you come to own is based on the
engine, why you think so. And while you're at it, explain why you
are so insecure to care what others think. While I understand that
others will always like 911s, 928s, even 356s better than my "mere
944," unless something radical happens in my life, I probably wouldn't
be caught dead buying one of those, and I don't care if you think I'm
a stupid Eli for thinking it... But that's the beauty of the system
here... I-can-think-what-I-want-and-you-can-think-what-you-want-and-
we-can-argue-and-never-get-anywhere-and-still-believe-what-we-want-just-
as-long-as-I-don't-hit-you-nor-you-hit-me-and-thus-we-can-stay-out-of-
the-legal-system... 

The final moral of this story is... Enjoy what you like! Let others
enjoy what they like! And consider this subject closed from my end...

'74 914 2.0

I currently only have two major complaints about the state of my car:

   1) The engine is WAY LOUD.
      I live at the end of a court, and the reverberation is quite
      obnoxious.  It sounds OK from inside the car, but I can't imagine
      that my neighbors are fond of my late night departures and
      arrivals.  What (besides going to hydraulic lifters when I
      rebuild it) can I do to quiet it?  (I don't really expect to
      be able to do much about this - just thought I'd ask.)

   2) The accelerator mechanism is sticky.
      Makes it difficult to drive smoothly at low speeds.  I had a leaky
      m/c which I replaced, and yesterday I bought new plastic pedal
      bushings.  I started to take everything apart, but after I
      disconnected the throttle cable from the pedal mechanism, I noticed
      that the pedal mechanism (by itself) is quite smooth.  I could
      also pull on the throttle cable (by hand) and it felt quite smooth.
      It only seems sticky when everything is connected together.

      The pedal box is really quite filthy, so I intend to take it apart
      and clean it and replace the bushings anyway, but if anyone can 
      suggest other things to try (like removing and lubing the
      accelerator wire? how?) I would appreciate it.

Oh yeah, there is a third problem with the car.  It's orange.  But I
think I know how to fix that...

Despite these problems, I've been enjoying the car a great deal.  It's
just getting warm enough to drive at night with the top off and the 
heater on full.  (warm air comes off the windshield and warms my hands.
loads of fun!)

Ok; now I see your point. However, I fail to see the
reasoning behind doing such a balancing if the car is
within one or two percentage points of 50-50. After
all, the 21 gallon tank in the 951 has gas weighing
at least 150 pounds (water weighs 8 lb/gal, so I figure
gas has to weigh less, although I know not for sure),
and as you use that up, the rear gets lighter. Also,
there is a driver in the driver's side, adding yet
another 150 to one side. From time to time there
may be other weight differences; i.e. I've decided
to leave my glove-box contents in today; that's 
10 pounds on the left... So, my point is, what's
the point of getting a car

800   800

800   800

If when you sit in it it will become (I guess:)

875   800

875   800

And when the gas gets near empty it becomes

875   800

800   725

And then you're really in trouble? Now, as I said,
I don't know what really happens, so please correct
me by all means!

Subject: Wanted: original 914-4 alloys

Wanted: a set of original Porsche 914-4 4-bolt 5.5x15" alloy wheels.  I'm
looking for the real McCoy, not replicas.

I realize there were three different kinds; any of them will do but the
four-spoke Fuchs model is preferred.

If you have a set, or know of anyone looking to sell a set, or can recommend
a good source, please let me know!  Thanks in advance.

Does anyone have a favorite mail order tire dealer?

I had an interesting experience yesterday, the goodyear VR50's that came with
the car (1980 911) definitly do not hold as well as the A008's I just put on 
the front (vr50's on the rear).

The traction break was also just a little unexpected.  Though, to be honest,
I may have initiated it by not staying on the pedal (getting too close to the
next car).

So...  I'm looking for a mail order Yokohama dealer.  Any suggestions?  Price
information?


Now, on to the H2O - N2/O2 wars!

I've seen a number of comments here that I have been having some trouble with...

911's  UNGAINLY.  Burn that guy at the stake! ;-)

Seriously, does anyone have coefficent of drag numbers for the 911 and the 944?
I don't work in fluids or aero, but did study fluids (a LOT) in grad school.
The 911 looks like it should have a very low drag profile, nice gentle taper on 
the rear, no sharp corners ('cept for the rain gutters...) on the in-direction-
of-flow edges (to generate vorticity).  The 944 is chopped off much squarer
on the back, though it does look cleaner in other places.  Also, 15 years
of development SHOULD account for something.

I'd be surprised if there is much difference in the drag.  Any takers?

Power:

If you read the engine descriptions in Anderson's book (911 performance
handbook), there are (I'm sure not for the street) engines listed that
produce 600-700 hp. (I think)

Also, RUF produces kits that will eventually give you a 211 mph 930.  So let's
drop this "intrinsicly low power producing" horseshit.

Yes, I'm sure similar power can be produced from a 944 or 928 engine.  It 
really depends on how much air you can stuff into the cylinders.

Handling:

911's sometimes wind up going backwards.  Fact of life.  If you take your 
foot off the pedal at the wrong time, be ready to steer a skid (they really
do steer well, skidding or not!).  I had no oscillations during my adventure
yesterday.  I think the driver is the critical issue here, not the car.

I don't know of any situtation (not just refering to cars here) where you can
get maximum performance without paying for it.  I think the going-backwards-
when-you-screw-up effect is the price you pay for the INCREDIBLE sticking-to-
the-ground effect you get when you drive the car correctly.

The bottom line here is that (last I looked) the 911's tended to produce
the best autocross times (with the 2.0 914 next!).  Of course, your milage
may vary.  From what I know of autocross (very little), the times are going
to be determined more by handling than power, and more by the driver than
either!

The 944 looks like a nice car, I'm sure I would enjoy driving one.  I have
not heard anything bad about them.  Would I want one instead of a 911?  Not
even!

Hi

Because of garage conflicts I couldn't do an oil change/valve
adjustment last weekend as I had planned, so I fidigeted around and
decided that I could at least replace the fuel filter on my '80 SC.
Well, one thing led to another and I ended up getting a fuel injector
cleaner kit and some aerosol cleaner to do a real number on my FI
system (I think it was here that someone posted about how this is a
real neat thing).  Anyway, this setup is supposed to be great for
K-Jetronic et.al. and its even clearly German in origin although the
brand name escapes me right now.  Well I'm sure it would have been
great except... no K-Jetronic diagram seems to match my system.  I
found the fuel distributor inlet O.K. but there are three outlets (the
most I found on any diagram were two). I tried various combos of
plugging and not plugging the outlets for which I had sufficient
plugging hardware, but the problem was I could never get the darn
engine to run for any significant length of time on just the cleaner
stuff like it should.  Yes I had the CIS air boot tight, I found out
how sensitive it is to air leaks when I couldn't get started on
gasoline.

Can anyone shed some light on this?  I think I actually helped the
running of the engine very slightly just by the stuff I managed to
squirt in there, but I'd like to do it right.

P.S.  After dis and reconnecting fuel lines and CIS boots for about
half of Sat and most of Sun it doesn't seem nearly as crowded now
around the back of my engine compartment!  Familiarity breeds
contempt.

Well, these numbers are old, but they still apply now as they did years ago.
The lift is measured at the wheels, front or rear.  The stock numbers are 183
lbs front @ 140 mph and 279 lbs rear @ 140 mph (320 lbs @ 150 mph).

rear end      279 lbs             92 lbs          38 lbs
 
The new tail on the Carrera series and the current air dams are probably more
effecient than these `old' numbers.  I don't have any info on how these affect
stability, which is related to moments and not forces.

As some of you may remember, I'm trying to replace the pedal bushings
on my '74 914 2.0.

Has anyone actually done this?  How did you remove the "hollow set pin"
that holds the clutch pedal on the clutch/brake shaft?  Hitting it with
a hammer (thru a nailset) accomplishes nothing.  Do I have to drill it
out?

X-Vmsmail-To: @PORSCHE

     As luck would have it, I am doing the very same pedal cluster job as 
Robert is right now on my '73 2.0 914.  Regarding the hollow set clutch pin, 
the guy who sold me the rebuild kit (made by Weltmeister) told me specifically 
not to use the pin in the kit, but rather to just keep the old one in there.  
The pins that Weltmeister makes are of inferior quality, and this guy says he 
saw several of them break in use before he started telling people not to use 
them. The shop where I got the kit has been doing good work on my car (on the 
jobs too big for me to tackle) for the last three years, so I am planning to 
take his advice.
     Right now I am at the stage in the job where I have the clutch cable 
clevis off, the accelerator cable ball joint disconnected, and the brake light 
switch off.  I am about to take the screws out of the mounting bracket, and 
then (hopefully) remove the cluster so I can replace the bushings.  What I am 
curious about is why are there no instructions about disconnecting anything 
between the cluster and the pin to the master brake cylinder?  Does the pin 
just rest on the cluster without anything actually connecting it?

Subject: Porsche 968


There is a "spy" photograph of the Porsche 968 coupe prototype in the
current issue of Autoweek (Feb 18 issue, page 4).  The blurb reads

	"Caught testing in France is the new Porsche 968, which
	the company is expected to show at September's Frankfurt
	Motor Show in both coupe and convertible (above) forms.
	Both are powered by 3.0 liter, 240 hp engines.  Porsche
	is also readying a 911 Turbo-based speedster."

The photo is a guards red coupe, looking much like the front end
of a 928 with the 959 headlights mounted onto a 944.  The cabrio
is an artist's illustration (De Naharro?).

While I'm excited about the front-end update, I must say I was hoping
for more engine power.  On the other side of the coin, maybe this
will make it more "affordable".  :-)

I'm sure the speedster will be a joy to behold, but priced in the
stratosphere...

Cheers,

	Hiya Porschephiles,

	I am in the market for a used 911. I have previously been refered
to the 1978 911 SC as being a very good first 911. But in reading the latest
Porsche Market Letter I have noticed that if I am willing to buy a car
with alot of miles I could get a 'newer' car. Which would ya'll
recommend?

	- get an older car with less miles 
	or
	- get a newer car with more miles

	What are the pros and cons of each side?


	Thanks alot, and happy motoring, Alex

I'll be at Tech Tactics this weekend, is anyone else going to be
there?

Does anyone remember the details of the story of how Barth burned his
foot at Le Mans in teh 70s?  At first I thought that when the throttle
was floored, his foot came into contact with a brake line - but as I
consider it further, I am thinking that a poorly placed oil line from
a front spoiler cooler might have been the culprit.  An article in
Excellence or Pano mentioned it, and Barth told the story at last
year's tech tactics....

Reply-To: srp@cgl.ucsf.EDU

About a month ago I wrote up a description of a stalling problem with a 911T.
A lot of you generously offered your opinions.  So, I just thought I'd fill
you in on the resolution.

Several people suggested checking/replacing the fuel filter.  I did, but
the problem persisted.  However, this provided a needed clue: even though
the filter was only 6K/1yr old, it was *full* of rust - disgusting it was.
So I took it in to a shop I could reach, asked them to have the gas tank
cleaned out, the lines blown clear, and.... Voila! Problem solved.

It feels *great* to have my ol' 911 back.

The car was the factory 936, and I don't remember him saying that the heat was
due to anything other than the positioning and venting of the front oil cooler. 
The wound sounded truly awful.

I'll be at Tech Tactics, and will see you there!  Steve Ross and I will be
driving out Friday evening in plenty of time for the reception.  Other Northeast
folks I know to be coming are Jim & Elizabeth Selders, Leon Piasecki, and Ron

Subject: 911 clutch cable
To: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

Hi everyone,

Got a question for the do-it-yourselfers:

I am having a slight shifting problem with my 911, one person has suggested 
that it may be due to a clutch hot spot.  I am also not happy with the clutch
feel, and much of what I am unhappy with feels like a worn clutch cable.

So...

I am replacing the cable.  The new cable arrived from automotion yesterday.
The cable is coated in plastic, and then runs through two seperate housings.
A heavy housing for where the cable runs outside the car, and a lighter 
one where it is inside.  The plastic coating appears to be bonded to the 
cable, and the cable will not slide inside it.  The coating slides inside the
housing(s).

There is NO lubrication on ANYWHERE on the new cable.  The old cable has grease
oozing out of the housing.

The question is:  anyone experienced with this type of cable, and did you 
lubricate the sucker before installation?

Thanks in advance,

--Soren            laforce@krypton.arc.nasa.gov

Subject: Re:  911 clutch cable

I replaced my 73 911 clutch cable last june - the cable was similar to what you
described.  I did not lubricate the thing, and have not had any problems
whatsoever since then.  Lubrication is usually a sign that something else is
wrong - maybe the cable is frayed someplace.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to hold the end of the cable with vise grips at the forward
hex portion of the end at the transmission.  If you don't, the cable will twist
when you tighten the nut and break several strands in the cable - I have seen
the premature death of 3 other cables from this cause (914 owners take note).
Also, the nut is a wierd undersized thing - I had to search for a while in my
nuts and bolts bag to find a pair that seemed to fit correctly.  Also, if you
still have the plastic cable stop at the transmission end, now is the time
to replace it before it breaks (it _will_ break eventually).

I had to rip up the carpet over the central channel in the cabin to properly
guide the cable to the cluster and connect it.  This was a pain since the
carpet was glued down and tacked on the sides with carpet nails.

Enjoy,

- Jeff Shorey

Its started raining again, which is good for California, but
bad for the rear luggage compartment of my 914.

It leaks.  It's rusty.  I would like to fix the leak before I treat 
the rust, but a quick inspection did not reveal how the water is
getting in.

I hear this is a common 914 problem...

Is it usually a problem with the trunk seal?  With the light lenses?
I'm confused because the trunk seal looks ok...

I don't know the 914's at all.  But if they're like other cars, they have drains
hidden here and there which are intended to direct rainwater away from seals and
other places it shouldn't be.  They often clog with age, and can lead to the
kind of problem you describe.

If your seals are OK and body panels true, the drains are what I would check
next.  Good luck!

Well, my 914 probably had every possible leak before the end of its life.
Around the turn signals is one place, especially if it every rusted there.
The trunk seals do seem to wear out and get thin and hard, so the center of
the rear above the lock became a leak.  The front can leak at the sides by
the hinges because of an old seal.  In my case, though, it seemed like these
were minor because of the way the rain hits the car whether it's being
driven or parked.  In my case the main source of water was sprayed from the
rear wheels through a split in the body where the inner wheel well meets the
rear side of the trunk.  Of course, for a california car, this might not be
a problem due to lack of salt.

On my car ('75 914 2.0), I have two leakage problems.  One in the same place
in the rear luggage compartment, and one at the front edges of the roof.  The
leak in the back is from a fairly obvious cause: there's about an inch gap
there!  I assume there is supposed to be some sort of seal between the engine
lid and the trunk lid, but it seems like it must be a pretty honking big seal.
The roof is slightly more confounding, as it looks as if it shouldn't leak.
Does anyone else have this problem?  I'm just discovering this stuff, as it's
rained only three or four times since I bought the car last summer, and the
rain yesterday was the first time I've driven it in the rain.

I have a 73 1.7 914 which leaks pretty bad between the window and roof on
the driver's side.  It leaks so bad that I can't use the seat belt when
it rains because the leak hits the belt just right and soaks it.  It leaks
both when the car is parked (the driver's seat gets pretty wet) and worse
when driving.   I'd like to hear about how to solve this problem if anyone
has any suggestions.

914 trunk leaks are almost always taillight lens leaks. Try taking your
taillights out, putting a *THIN* coat of RTV around the various  openings,
and re-installing the taillight assemblies. Worked for me, and I'm down
here in swamp city....

Huh? Between the engine lid and the trunk lid, sure, there's about a 1/2" gap.
But there is a seal inside the trunk at the leading edge (actually, about 2"
back from the leading edge) that compresses when the deck lid (trunk) is down.
If this is not happening, you probably have a sprung deck lid and may need
to have some  body work done to fix it.

See above.

That's a failed windshield seal. I know, it's not what I think of when I think
"windshield seal", but on 914's (and 911 Targas) that apparrently means
the rubber across the top and down the sides of the windshield frame. If you
replace it, you should get a lot drier. You may have to replace the targa
top side seals as well. FYI, when you start replacing rubber on a 914, be 
prepared for a rude shock. I spent about $1100 in parts alone to re-rubberize
mine a few years back....

This is the part that assounded me. I *ALWAYS* take any open car (cabrio,
roadster, sypder, targa, sun roof, etc.) to a high-pressure coin-op car
wash, and blast all hell out of the car trying to make it leak at all openings
until I'm reasonably satisfied that it's watertight, or at least watertight
in anything short of an hurricane. Maybe it has something to do with the 
> 75" of rain we get a year here. Maybe it's just common sense.  Dunno.
(Of course, it still hasn't stopped me from buying a few leakers, but at
least I knew they were going to leak going in to the deal...)

Subject: 944 s2


hello,

    I'm looking at a 90 model 944 s2.  It is loaded, w/air bags on both
  sides, custom seats, and has approx 2k miles.  Could someone give me a
  what a reasonable price would be for this car.  I would appreciate it 
  greatly.

   Thank you,
